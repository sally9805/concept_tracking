TITLE : FEARLESS <P> DIRECTOR : PETER WEIR <P> WRITER : RAFAEL YGLESIAS <P> THE BOTTOM LINE : In one of the year 's most unusual movies , a disaster story is turned into a haunting mystery play . <P> They stumble silently out of a cornfield , tattered , battered survivors of some disaster either natural or unnatural . The almost hallucinatory opening sequence does not tell us what befell them . No one speaks . There is no sound except an eerie musical theme . But these stunned faces are familiar to us . We see them every day on television , in newspaper and magazine photos . They haunt our century . And our anxious imaginings . For these are the faces of those whom cataclysm has inexplicably spared and who must now pass their borrowed time contemplating fate 's enigmatic workings . <P> In the case of Fearless , the cataclysm is a plane crash . Among the survivors is Max Klein ( Jeff Bridges ) , an architect . He comes out of that field leading a young boy and cradling a baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others to safety as well , despite the fact that his partner and best friend died horribly just a few feet from him . Max 's opposite number is Carla Rodrigo ( Rosie Perez ) , whose baby was wrenched from her arms and killed on impact . <P> Max soon develops a near Godlike sense of immortality . He imperturbably noshes strawberries , to which he previously had a deadly allergy . He stands on the edge of high buildings daring the winds or a misstep to carry him away . He deliberately crashes his car into a wall at high speed . Nothing can touch him  --  except the plight of Carla , who has been reduced to an almost catatonic state by grief . He feels compelled to bring her back to life , and he is quite obnoxious in this , his final rescue attempt . <P> His arrogance alienates him from his wife ( Isabella Rossellini ) and son . They  --  like John Turturro 's determinedly patient psychiatrist , a specialist in traumatic stress , and Tom Hulce 's determinedly impatient tort lawyer , trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more humble and malleable response to a near death experience . <P> For that , finally , is what this remarkable movie is about . We discover that Max has literally seen the light , that blinding white light that features in so many reports of out-of-body experiences . He has walked some way down the tunnel to the afterlife that is also a convention of these tales . Arrogance , a belief that he is of the elect , is an entirely plausible , if quite unexpected , response . <P> That 's the great thing about Fearless  --  its unexpectedness . The most one might expect these days in a movie about a plane crash is Airport ' 93 . The ; best we might hope for in a study of survivors is psychological faith healing . But Rafael Yglesias has written what amounts to a meditation on mortality . In the process , he has provided director Peter Weir with a route back to his best vein , that of Picnic at Hanging Rock and The Last Wave , those curiously creepy movies in which ineffable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Together , the filmmakers have given Bridges a singular figure  --  beamy , spooky , secretive  --  to play and provided Perez , a ferociously real , marvelously touching actress , with a role that should make her a star .
