<p> She is a mother of four . An experienced bus driver with a good record . And now a woman in anguish . <p> To blame Pat Catencamp for the school bus crash in Fox River Grove that killed seven children last month is something most people , residents and investigators alike , are reluctant to do . <p> Better to blame the signal light or the design of the intersection . Better to blame inanimate objects that can feel no pain . <p> But human error is almost always a factor when a train is in a crash , transportation experts say , and the crash in Fox River Grove probably was no exception . <p> As investigators and personal-injury lawyers continue to dissect the accident in the coming months , Catencamp 's actions will be closely scrutinized . <p> The issue of bus driver training  --  without reference to Fox River Grove  --  also will be on the agenda when a state legislative committee holds a hearing in Chicago on Monday ; to explore the broader topic of school bus safety . <p> " Nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excuse her , " said Arthur Yeager , national coordinator of the Coalition for School Bus Safety . " Trains do n't leave their tracks and hit school buses , so the bus had to be in front of the train . The person who placed that bus in front of the train was the driver . " <p> The real issue , Yeager said , may come down to proportioning blame  --  determining how much fault lies with Catencamp and how much lies elsewhere . Evidence gathered so far suggests the intersection of U.S. 14 and Algonquin Road was highly dangerous , permitting too little room for driver error . <p> As the investigation continues , concerns may be raised not only about Catencamp 's actions behind the wheel but about bus driver policies in School Districts 47 and 155 and , perhaps , across the state . <p> Among those concerns are the following : <p> As a bus approaches a railroad crossing , drivers must " require silence , " according to Illinois School Bus Driver Training Curriculum , the bible for bus driver training in Illinois . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the driver should " turn off heaters and fans , if necessary . " <p> The point is to make it easier for the driver to hear a coming train . <p> Catencamp  --  who told investigators she never heard the train  --  was playing a radio , several students said . The volume , one student said , was " faint . " And investigators have implied that Catencamp did not turn off the heaters . <p> The manual instructs drivers to check " the distance that can be seen clearly in either direction down the tracks . " Catencamp told investigators that she did this and saw no train . But less than six blocks away , the engineer said , he did see the bus . He watched it roll onto the tracks and stop . <p> The manual warns drivers to stay off the tracks " until you are certain there is adequate room ahead for your ENTIRE vehicle to clear the tracks completely . " <p> But Catencamp , according to investigators , apparently crossed the tracks at a red light , only to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space between the tracks and the stop line at the intersection . The tracks are above the road grade , said John Goglia of the National Transportation Safety Board , and Catencamp probably could not see , before she crossed , just how little room she had ahead . <p> Catencamp , 54 , of Crystal Lake , has eight years of experience as a bus driver and supervisor for the two McHenry County school districts . She also trains new drivers for the districts , guiding them through the four hours of behind-the-wheel instruction required by state law . <p> Although Catencamp was sub <p> stituting for the route 's regular driver that fateful morning and was unfamiliar with the route , the possibility remains that she had driven buses over the tracks at that intersection previously , either while driving other routes or training other drivers . <p> School district officials and Catencamp 's lawyer last week declined to discuss the accident . But state Board of Education officials said it only stands to reason that Catencamp , as a driving instructor , trained other drivers in how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " If she was an instructor  --  and she was a good instructor  --  I 'm sure that would be part of her training , " said Alvida Petro of the state Board of Education . " I assume that any driver being trained will be taught the proper approach to railroad crossings . It 's covered in the classroom , and I would assume it 's part of the behind-the-wheel training . " <p> Catencamp was running 20 minutes late the morning of the accident and apparently never checked the bus " route sheet . " If she had , though , it would not have done her much good . <p> Route sheets are maintained for every school bus route in Illinois . By law , they must include a map or description of the route , a list of the children on board and any other pertinent information . Drivers are not required to record traffic hazards , though , and apparently seldom do so . <p> The regular driver on the Fox River Grove route told investigators she knew the intersection of U.S. 14 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the tracks unless the light was green . But , she said , she never noted that on her route sheet . <p> In the wake of the accident , some local school officials said , Illinois perhaps should consider requiring that route sheets explicitly include any and all information about dangerous intersections . <p> " It 's an interesting idea , especially in larger districts with several railroad crossings , " said Jim Fritts , assistant superintendent in Skokie School District 68 . <p> School bus safety advocate Yeager said he was surprised to learn that Catencamp was unfamiliar with the route she drove . As a supervisor and substitute driver , he said , she should have known all of the routes , especially those that cross railroad tracks . <p> Wilmette School District 39 , for example , achieves that goal by hiring full-time substitute drivers who are trained on every route . When not driving a bus , the substitute drivers do custodial work . <p> But Supt. John Sloan stressed that Wilmette is a compact district , with only a handful of routes , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more difficult to train substitutes on every route in outlying school districts , " Sloan said . " They tend to be much larger . " <p> Yeager suggested two other reforms : smaller buses on routes that have cramped intersections , and monitors on every bus . Rhode Island began requiring monitors in 1985 . Since then , Yeager said , there have been no fatalities . <p> " The monitor is the driver 's second set of eyes , " Yeager said . " If there had been a monitor in Fox River Grove , he might have seen the train . " <p> Petro said she has doubts about society 's ability to legislate every horror out of existence . <p> " You can plan for all kinds of circumstances , but there will always be some things that , no matter how hard you plan , jump up and say ' boo , ' " Petro said . " Speaking for myself , I see this as a tragic accident . "
