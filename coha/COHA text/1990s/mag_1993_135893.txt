At New York City 's Rice High School in Harlem , there is a conspicuous illustration on one of the walls of Mrs. Simonelli 's art class . It is the first sketch in Felipe Lopez 's blue period . The ink drawing features the planet earth shedding a tear while coddling a child . The Rice senior , who many scouts say is the most accomplished high school basketball artist in the nation , explains that his work symbolizes the need to care for all children in poverty . Felipe admits that he is still a child himself and that children are often idealists , but in the heart of Harlem you must probe deep to find a paragon like Felipe Lopez . " I have so many good ideas in my head , " the artist says . " I want to change the unhappy world around me , so I must use my creativity in class and on the court to bring hope . " // When Felipe immigrated to New York City from the Dominican Republic in 1989 , during the summer before his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else in English . Since that day his vocabulary has nourished along with his body . He has added 6 ? inches and 40 pounds to reach his current 6 ' 5 " , 180-pound stature , expanding skyward so quickly that one day a few years back he pulled a pair of pants from his closet and did n't recognize them as his own . Felipe 's lithe , elastic build recalls that of Michael Jordan , prompting his mother , Carmen , to say , " If he would eat more , he could be like the man who jumps . " // Like so many kids in the Dominican Republic , Felipe was encouraged to play baseball but was quickly discouraged when he shagged a throw with his nostrils . He gravitated to hoops , the more so once he reached the States . Three years later , he declined a $500,000 offer to forgo the rest of high school and the prospect of college to play pro basketball in Spain . Last season he averaged 25.1 points , 8.7 rebounds and live love-struck Division I coaches per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Felipe has tremendous potential , " says recruiting maven Tom Konchalski . " He has the speed of a world-class sprinter and can leap tall buildings in a single bound . He is already an icon in the Latino community , more popular than Menudo ever was . " // Felipe clearly has the talent to make a big name for himself and establish a presence in basketball for the Hispanic community , of which he is already the pride and hope . So revered is Felipe in his native Dominican Republic that when he returned to his hometown of Santiago this summer and joined a pickup game , more than 1,000 neighbors came to watch . The game ended when Felipe tore down the rim on a dunk and scraped his arm . A woman came out of the bleachers to stanch the bleeding , then asked Felipe if he would autograph the bloody hankie. // Felipe , in turn , respects his heritage and vows he will attend college in a city with a large Hispanic community . He has tailored his choices to that end . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to see me play , " he says . " My greatest joy is when the children come to me and say , ' I 'm going to be the next Felipe . ' " // During his career at Rice , Felipe has become accustomed to playing before appreciative crowds , even during road games . On Dec. 2 the Raiders opened their season at George Washington High in Manhattan 's Washington Heights , a Dominican enclave . Felipe dazzled the crowd with 48 points , including two treys and five poster-worthy dunks . After the game , when someone mentioned that 48 points had to be the most ever scored by a Rice player , one could n't help but recall a moment a few hours earlier in Mrs. Simonelli 's classroom . " You could say that I 'm greedy , " Felipe had said , staring at the full circumference of his planet earth . " I want to make history everywhere I go . "
