Last month our art critic , Robert Hughes , was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences , a group founded in 1780 by John Adams , the country 's second President , to allow people of " genius and learning to cultivate the arts and sciences in the new nation . " Considered one of the most prestigious scholarly institutions , its membership is heavily academic . Along with Hughes , only 15 people in the fine-arts fields were elected this year  --  among them cellist Yo Yo Ma , choreographer Jerome Robbins and sculptor Richard Serra . <P> Since 1970 , Hughes has filled our magazine 's pages with vigorous commentary written at a high intellectual pitch . Yet he never fails to make his subjects appealing and accessible  --  with humor , apt social context and , more than occasionally , a rude remark . <P> Still , an art critic can seem like a remote figure . Christopher Porterfield , senior editor for the Art section , knows better . " He 's an inveterate phoner , " says Porterfield . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is often writing at 5  --  and he gives me a declamatory reading of new work , chuckling with pleasure . His enthusiasm is great . Especially after 8 a.m . " <P> The essence of Bob 's approach can be summarized in what might be called Hughes ' Laws , informal but very emphatic : <P> 1 . Art is pretty concrete stuff , it 's not metaphysical perfume . So be concrete . <P> 2 . Do n't talk down to readers , and using jargon always means talking down . <P> 3 . Art does not carry ideas the way a truck carries coal . We should n't try to retrofit the art of 300 years ago with our moral attitudes . The past is a very foreign place . <P> 4 . Above all , never pretend to have sensations from a work of art that you have n't had . It 's the greatest lie of all . <P> Hughes ' new book of essays , Culture of Complaint : The Fraying of America ( Oxford University Press ) , has just been published . Next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American art , called American Visions . Working on it , he became fascinated by how little Americans know about their early art and its role in the nation 's life . He recalls Adams ' contemporary , Thomas Jefferson , admiring the Maison Carree at Nimes in France . Moved by its classical structure , he decided it should be the model for the new capitol in Richmond , Virginia . " Noble , astringent , eloquent , " remarks Hughes , " just what the new republic stood for . " That 's a series we 'll tune in to .
