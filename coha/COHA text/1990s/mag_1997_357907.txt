SILVERWARE FROM BENEATH THE SEA To move offshore , a designer takes on pirates <P> IZABEL LAM INTERNATIONAL HEADQUARTERS Brooklyn , N.Y . 1996 REVENUES $2.5 million MARKETS All continents <P> Creative genius allowed Izabel Lam to produce sensational dinnerware and cutlery designs . But to sell them successfully worldwide , she had to develop other qualities : a tough skin , a readiness to fight legal battles in country after country and a willingness to subordinate her artistic tastes to production considerations , though of a special sort . Her problem was one that bedevils many other American exporters and overseas manufacturers , big and small : design piracy . <P> Lam arrived in the U.S. from Hong Kong in 1972 to study design . She stayed to work for Calvin Klein and Geoffrey Beene , then launched her own clothing line in the early 1980s . By 1988 , however , she abandoned clothing design to concentrate on what seemed like an impossible artistic ambition : giving metal objects the look of some of the shifting and sinuous forms she saw in underwater visions while scuba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give steel the look of draped silk . <P> Aesthetically , the dinnerware and cutlery that her company , Izabel Lam International , began marketing in 1989 were an immediate success . Getting the line manufactured was a headache , however . Lam was then working in bronze , which had a beautiful soft luster , but American manufacturers could not seem to give it the special twist she wanted . The only factory that could was in Thailand . <P> But why were the Thais persistently unable to turn out knives , spoons and dishes in the quantities Lam ordered ? And why was the money from sales in Europe so much less than might have been expected , given the glowing reports Lam 's aides got about buyer reaction ? Tim McCarthy , then president of Izabel Lam International , visited Europe in the early 1990s and quickly solved the mystery . The Thais had not only pirated the designs but had also set up their own network of European agents who sold the cutlery and sent the money back to Thailand , not to Lam . <P> Lam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy and France to stop the sale of pirated designs . McCarthy flew to Thailand and hired Pinkerton detectives to find and close down the pirates . They could not do so completely because metal can be cast in too many places : somebody 's backyard or even an open field . <P> Eventually , Lam switched from bronze to stainless steel . She says she still prefers bronze , but stainless steel can be turned into satisfactorily sensuous shapes , and many customers prefer it because it does not need to be polished . Also , designing in steel gave her a much wider choice of manufacturers  --  honest ones . She chose Wing Sheng , found that in Europe , " control was hard . You 're not the only moneymaker , and the distributors we were working with gravitated to whoever earned the most for them , " which mostly meant local firms . Some customers objected to buying cutlery made in China , because they thought the Chinese could not make quality merchandise . Lam switched some of her attention from art to distribution . To bypass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany and contacted stores and boutiques directly to persuade them to buy the goods stockpiled there .
