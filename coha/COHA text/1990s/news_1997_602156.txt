<p> Flu shots drive down absenteeism and health-care costs so much that companies are starting to entice  --  and sometimes pressure  --  workers to roll up their sleeves . <p> Workers who get flu shots at Cigna insurance company take 1.4 fewer sick days a year . After shots were introduced to the company 's Nashville office last year , workers reporting flu symptoms fell 92% . Emergency room visits for such symptoms were all but eliminated . <p> Eastman Kodak estimates it saved as much as $ 2.8 million in absenteeism alone last year . Yet , even when Kodak absorbs the $ 8-$ 10 cost of each shot and dishes them out on company time , 70% of its employees refuse . They wo n't take one in the deltoid for the team . <p> " This is business critical , " says medical director Wayne Lednar , who says coercion is out of the question at Kodak . " Treating respiratory disease costs 50 times more than preventing it . " <p> In the event you 've missed all the missives at your company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flu season that follows shortly . Shots have long been recommended in earnest for people over 65 and those with chronic illnesses because flu can kill . But between 1989 and last year , the over-65 population grew by about 6 million while flu shots given increased from 20 million to nearly 58 million . " There 's a suggestion , " that flu vaccine is finding its way into the young and the healthy , says Dr. Raymond Strikas of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . <p> In Denver , the Visiting Nurse Association gave shots at 800 companies last year , up from 400 in 1994 . They gave shots at 243 companies in Washington , D.C. , up from 59 in 1993 . Sixty-six percent of large companies are so convinced of the potential savings that they offer convenient flu shot programs , most of them on site and at no charge , according to a Hewitt &; Associates survey . Workers at Freddie Mac e-mail their preferred date and time and are e-mailed back a confirmation . <p> Even Parke-Davis , which quit making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of inadequate potency , has n't stopped offering shots to its employees . Procter &; Gamble , maker of Puffs , gives 15,000 free flu shots a year to its Cincinnati workforce . Kimberly Clark , maker of Kleenex , will offer free flu shots for the first time this year to its 5,800 employees in Neenah , Wis . <p> Too few get shots <p> Despite the all-out push , acceptance at most companies peaks near 30% , no where near the 80% needed for so-called herd immunity , when those who take shots shield those in the office who do not . <p> The logical step to boost acceptance is a token incentive , something beyond the candy and ibuprofen given this year to the willing 600 at Freddie Mac in McLean , Va. , or the juice-and-bagel bribe to 300 at the American Association of Retired Persons in Washington . Hewitt &; Associates says some companies are handing out coffee mugs or rubber balls that workers squeeze to relieve stress . Cigna gives $ 50 savings bonds to pregnant employees who complete a pre-natal course . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incentives for flu shots are likely coming , says Cigna health director Vicky Dickson . <p> T-shirts ? Raffles for a car or vacation ? " Anything to increase penetration , " Lednar says . <p> The other obvious step is more dicey . " You ca n't force anyone . That would be ethically questionable , " says Cigna 's Deborah Veney Robinson . <p> But some workers report having managers like Audrey McCash at Cigna headquarters in Philadelphia . This time of year she walks around giving so many reminders that her staff " probably gets sick of hearing from me . " <p> Outright coercion is rare , says Sharon Johnson , a Washington , D.C. , nurse who gave 4,500 flu shots at companies last year , 175 during one four-hour stretch . But many employees are warned : " We do n't want anybody in our department getting the flu because they did n't get a shot , " she says . Johnson occasionally runs into needle-phobic workers " who feel corporate pressure and are really terrified . " <p> Cutting absenteeism <p> Pressure may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times of leaner staffs . The popularity of work teams means projects screech to a halt when crucial members are out sick . Full-blown flu can knock a healthy 20-something worker out for a week , costing $ 962 for every $ 50,000 he makes in salary and benefits . The flu will likely send him or her to the doctor 's office ( $ 70 ) , possibly to the hospital ( $ 1,000 and up ) . Productivity suffers when he or she returns at a fraction of full speed . And , should the flu be transmitted to children , he or she is likely to be out nursing them . DuPont is among the companies that offer free shots to family members as well . <p> On an average day at the typical company , three workers out of 100 will call in sick . Trim that to two workers a day and a company of 5,000 workers could save $ 1 million for a $ 40,000 investment in shots . <p> Total potential savings : $ 12 billion a year , estimates a New England Journal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 850 workers  --  half which took placebo shots  --  showed that absenteeism and doctor 's visits due to respiratory illness fell by more than 40% . Savings came to $ 47 per shot given , which study author Dr. Kristin Nichol says is conservative . <p> Strikas praises the study , but warns that flu shot savings wo n't be consistent from year to year . Shots save companies much more when the flu season is harsh . It 's started early this year with confirmed cases in Hawaii , but the severity is expected to be milder than last year . <p> Younger workers may find themselves more vulnerable this season , says Dr. Gregory Poland , professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic . The Type B strain expected to predominate " tends not to make the elderly sick because they 've been exposed to it . But young working people have not been exposed and are highly likely to get it  --  and miss work . " <p> Some companies find additional opportunity in flu shots . About 2,400 Rite Aid stores and 400 Wal-Mart stores are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both say it 's not a moneymaker , but it gets people in the stores . Rite Aid sold 94,000 shots last year . <p> Why workers refuse <p> A few companies are starting to ask their workers why they wo n't take a shot . Most are like Raymond Werntz , vice president of an 1,100-employee company in Rolling Meadows , Ill. , who has never bothered because " I have n't had a sick day in my life . " <p> Eighty-five percent of workers who turned down flu shots at Cigna said it was because they are healthy . They 've been lucky , says Rosemary Downey , a Cigna telecommunications analyst who took a flu shot in 1995 , then skipped last year . She wound up going to the doctor three times and taking seven sick days over two months trying to fully recover . " In 1995 I got black and blue from the shot , but I 'm willing this year . " <p> Nurses say about one in five shot recipients still ask if they 're going to get the flu from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no , " nurse Sharon Johnson says . <p> Fear of needles was cited by 5% of Cigna employees who refused the shot . Cathy O'Grady , a Denver nurse who helped pioneer workplace flu shots 14 years ago among school teachers , says most needlephobes seem to be young , white women . <p> But both men and women cracked nervous jokes at a Freddie Mac shot assembly line this week and nurse Lexi Gaber kept having to ask people to pull their chairs closer to hers . <p> The tendency is for workers to inadvertently push farther and farther away from the table of syringes . <p> Contributing : Anita Manning
