Faith I begin with the ridiculous , in June 1952 , middle-century Minnesota , on that silvery-hot morning when Herbie Zylstra and I nailed two plywood hoards together and called it an airplane . " What we need , " said Herbie , " is an engine . " The word engine -- its meanings beyond mere meaning -- began to open up for me . I went into the house and found my father . " I 'll need an engine , " I told him . " Engine ? " he said . " For an airplane . " My father thought about it . " Makes sense , " he said . " One airplane engine , coming up . " " When ? " " Soon enough , " said my father . " Pronto . " Was this a promise ? Was this duplicity ? Herbie and I waited all summer . We painted our airplane green . We cleared a runway in the backyard , moving the big white birdbath , digging up two of my mother 's rhododendrons . We eyed our plane . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a scoffing noise . " Parachutes , " he said . ( A couple of his front teeth were missing , which caused bubbles to form when he laughed at me . ) " Anyway , do n't be stupid . We 'll drop bombs on people . Bomb my house . " So we filled mason jars with gasoline . Through July and August , in the soft , grave density of that prairie summer , we practiced our bombing runs , getting the feel of it , the lift , the swoop . Herbie was eight , I was seven . We made the sounds an engine would make . In our heads , where the world was , we bombed Mrs. Catchitt 's garage , the church across the street , Jerry Powell and his cousin Ernest and other people we feared or despised . Mostly , though , we bombed Herbie 's house . The place was huge and bright yellow , a half block away , full of cousins and uncles and nuns and priests and leathery old grandmothers . A scary house , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yelling " Die ! " as he banked into a dive ; he said things about his mother , about black bones and fires in the attic . For me , the bombing was fine . It seemed useful , vaguely productive , but the best part was flight itself , or the anticipation of flight , and over those summer days the word engine did important engine work in my thoughts . I did not envision machinery . I envisioned thrust : a force pressing upward and outward , even beyond . This notion had its objective component -- properties both firm and man-made -- but on a higher level , as pure idea , the engine that my father would be bringing home did not operate on mechanical principles . I knew nothing , for example , of propellers and gears and such . My engine would somehow contain flight . Like a box , I imagined , which when opened would release the magical qualities of levitation into the plywood boards of my airplane . At night , in bed , I would find myself murmuring that powerful , empowering word : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it meant , everything it did not mean but should . Summer ended , autumn came , and what my father finally brought home was a turtle . A mud turtle -- small and black . My father had a proud look on his face as he stooped down and placed it on our backyard runway . " That thing 's a turtle , " Herbie said . " Toby , " said my father . " I think his name is Toby . " " Well , God , I know that , " Herbie said . " Every turtle on earth , they 're all named Toby . It 's still just a stupid old turtle . " " A pretty good one , " my father said . Herbie 's face seemed to curdle in the bright sunlight . He scooped up the turtle , searched for its head , then dropped it upside down on the runway . I remember backing away , feeling a web of tensions far too complex for me : disappointment , partly , and confusion , but mostly I was afraid for my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , very demonstrative , easily unnerved by the wrongs of the world . " Oh , boy , " he muttered . He took a few slow steps , then ran . If anything was said between my father and me , I can not remember it . What I do remember -- vividly -- is feeling stupid . The words turtle and engine seemed to do loops in the backyard sunlight . There had to be some sort of meaningful connection , a turtleness inside engineness , or the other way around , but right then I could not locate the logic . The backyard was silent . I remember my father 's pale-blue eyes , how he gazed at something just beyond the birdbath . " Well , " he said , then stopped and carefully folded his hands . " Sorry , Tommy . Best I could do . " Then he turned and went into the house . Afterward , I stood studying Toby . I poked at him with my foot . " Hey , you , " I murmured , but it was a very stupid turtle , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot , or my voice , or anything else in the physical universe . Turtle , I kept thinking , and even now , in my middle age , those twin syllables still claw at me . The quick t 's on my tongue : turtle . Even after four decades I can not encounter that word without a gate creaking open inside me . Turtle for the world -- turtle for you -- will never be turtle for me . Nor this : corn . Nor this : Pontiac . Have you ever loved a man , then lost him , then learned he lives on Fiji with a new lover ? Is Fiji still Fiji ? Coconuts and palm trees ? At sixteen , in a windy autumn cornfield , I made first love on the hood of my father 's green Pontiac . I remember the steel against my skin . I remember darkness , too , and a sharp wind , and rustlings in the corn . I was terrified . Pontiac means : Will this improve ? And that Indian-head ornament on the hood -- did the bastard bite my feet ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eyewitness , sly critic : the word Indian embraces all of these meanings and many more . The world shrieks and sinks talons into our hearts . This we call memory . In the backyard that afternoon , alone with Toby , I felt a helplessness that went beyond engines or turtles . It had to do with treachery . Even back then , in a dark , preknowledge way , I understood that language was involved , its frailties and mutabilities , its potential for betrayal . My airplane , after all , was not an airplane . No engine on earth would make it fly . And over the years I have come to realize that Herbie and I had willfully deceived ourselves , renaming things , reinventing the world , which was both pretending and a kind of lying . But there were also the words my father had used : " One airplane engine , coming up . " His intent , I know , was benign . To encourage . To engage . And yet for me , as a seven-year-old , the language he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one I kept pestering him to honor , and through July and August , as summer heated up , my father must have felt trapped by a promise he neither had intended nor could possibly keep . " Right . I 'm working on it , " he 'd say , whenever I brought up the subject . He 'd say , " Pretty soon , partner . " He 'd say , " No sweat . " He 'd say , " Be patient . I 've placed the order . " But a turtle ? Why not broccoli ? * * * The next morning was a Sunday . Maybe an hour after Mass , Herbie walked into my backyard . " Your dad 's a liar , " he said . " Yeah , sort of , " I told him , " but not usually , " then I tried to mount a defense . I talked about Toby , what a fine turtle he was , how I could get him to stick his head out from under the shell by putting a pan of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toby as a bomb . " It 'll be neat , " I said . " Drop him on the mailman . " Herbie looked at me hard . " Except your dad 's still a liar , Tommy . They all are . They just lie and lie . They ca n't even help it . That 's what fathers are for . Nothing else . They lie . " I stood silent . Arguments , I knew , were useless . All I could do was wait -- which I did -- and after a few moments Herbie strolled over to our plywood airplane , picked it up , and carried it across the lawn . He placed it tail down against the garage . " It 's not a plane anymore , " he said . " It 's a cross . " " Cross how ? " I asked . " Like in the Bible , " said Herbie . " A cross . Let 's go get my sister . Lorna Sue -- we 'll nail her to it . " " Okay , " I said . We walked the half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormous , especially to a child , and it took a long while to find Lorna Sue , who sat playing with her dollhouse up in the attic . She was seven years old . Very pretty : black hair , summer-brown skin , I liked her a lot , and Lorna Sue liked me too , which was obvious , and a decade later we would find ourselves in a cornfield along Highway 16 , completely in love , very cold , testing our courage on the hood of my father 's Pontiac . The world sometimes precedes itself . In the attic that day -- September 1952 -- I am almost certain that both Lorna Sue and I understood deep in our bones that significant events were now in motion . I remember the smell of that attic , so dank and fungal , so dangerous . I remember Herbie gazing down at his sister . " We need you , " he said . " What for ? " said Lorna Sue . " It 'll be neat . Tommy and me , we 've got this cross -- we 'll nail you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was love . Seven years old . Even then . " Well , " she said , " I guess so . " And so the three of us trooped back to my house . Impatiently , under Herbie 's supervision , Lorna Sue stood against the cross and spread out her slender brown arms . " This better be fun , " she said , " because I 'm pretty busy . " Herbie and I went into the garage , where we found a hammer and two rusty nails . I remember a frothiness in my stomach ; I felt queasy , yes , but also curious . As we walked back toward Lorna Sue , I lagged behind a little . " You think this 'll hurt ? " I asked . Herbie shrugged . His eyes had a hard , fixed , enthusiastic shine , like the eyes of certain trained assassins I would later encounter in the mountains of Vietnam . Herbie gripped the hammer in his right hand . Quietly , like a doctor , he told Lorna Sue to close her eyes , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my mother came out the back door with a basket of damp laundry . The basket was blue , the laundry mostly white . " What 's this ? " my mother asked . " Sunday school , " Lorna Sue said . " I get to be Jesus . " At dinner that evening , the hammer and nails lay at the center of the kitchen table . It was a long and very difficult meal . Over and over , I had to explain how the whole thing had been a game , just for fun , not even a real cross . My father studied me as if I 'd come down with polio . " The hammer , " he said . " You see the hammer ? " " Sure . " " Is it real ? " " Naturally , " I said . He nodded . " And the nails ? Real or unreal ? " " Real , " I told him , " but not like . . . I mean , is Toby a real engine ? " My father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firmed up , how he leaned back , glanced over at my mother , then segued into a vigorous lecture about the difference between playing games and driving nails through people 's hands . Even as a seven-year-old , I already knew the difference -- it was obvious -- but sitting there at the kitchen table , feeling wronged and defenseless , I could not find words to say the many things I wanted to say : that I was not a murderer , that events had unfolded like a story in a book , that I had been pulled along by awe and wonder , that I had never really believed in any of it , that I was almost positive that Herbie would not have hammered those nails through Lorna Sue 's pretty brown hands . These and other thoughts spun through my head . But all I could do was stare down at my plate and say , " All right . " " All right what ? " my father said . " You know . I wo n't nail anybody . " " What about Herbie ? " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm pretty sure . " But he did . The left palm . Halfway through . Almost dead center . Accuracy matters . Herbie Zylstra was not a mean-spirited child . Nothing of the sort . Hyperactive , to be sure , and so impulsive he could sometimes make my stomach wobble , but I never felt physical fear in his presence . More like wariness -- a butterfly sensation . In a later decade , Herbie would have been a candidate for Ritalin or some similar drug , gallons of the stuff , a long rubber hose running from pharmacy to vein . Accuracy , though . September . A Saturday morning , two weeks after school opened . Around noon Herbie stopped by . " I 'll need the cross , " he said . I was busy with Toby ; I barely looked up . Herbie muttered something and picked up the cross and carried it over to his house and set it up against a big elm tree on the front lawn . He found Lorna Sue . He told her to stay steady . He squinted and pursed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center of her left palm and took aim and cocked his wrist . He did not have the strength , I suppose , to drive the nail all the way through , or maybe it was n't a solid strike , or maybe at the last instant Herbie held back out of some secret virtue , pity or humility . I was not there to witness it . All I can attest to is the sound of sirens . Voices too , I think . And maybe a scream . But maybe not . Later in the day my mother called me inside and told me about it . Immediately , I ran for my bedroom . I slammed the door , crawled under the bed , made fists , yelled something , banged the floor . What I was feeling , oddly enough , was a kind of rage , a cheated sensation : denied access to something rare and mysterious and important . I should have been there -- an eyewitness to the nailing . I deserved it . Even now , half a lifetime later , my absence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had earned the right . It was my plywood . My green paint . Other reasons too : because at age sixteen I would make first love with Lorna Sue Zylstra on the hood of my father 's Pontiac , and because ten years later we would be married , and because twenty-some years after that Lorna Sue would discover romance with another man , and betray me , and move to Tampa . After the nailing , I did not see Herbie for almost a year . He was dispatched to a Jesuit boys ' school up in the Twin Cities -- a " hospital school , " my mother called it , which was probably close to accurate -- and when he returned the following summer , in early June , things were different . I had new friends ; Herbie had a new personality . He was a loner now . Silent and self-absorbed . The transformation was remarkable , edging up on radical , and if I were a believer in the Pauline epiphanies , or in divine intervention , which I most certainly am not , I might be tempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power during his stay with the good Catholics of Minneapolis . Contrition , so rare in any of us , seemed to have struck Herbie Zylstra as a nine-year-old . This is not to say that the reformation was absolute . He still had a temper ; he could go hard and hostile . In fact , from all I could tell , the new Herbie was wound tighter than ever . The sweetness was gone . The naive , impish exuberance had been sucked out of him , recklessness replaced by qualities much more stern -- something zealous and rigid , a severity of spirit that seemed a little eerie . For the next eight years , until he graduated from high school , Herbie and I went our separate ways . Not unfriendly but never friendly either . He kept to himself , earned respectable grades , played a skillful forward on a basketball team that twice advanced to the state semifinals . In a cautious way , most people admired him , especially girls . He moved well . He was tall and lean , with gray eyes and wavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet , smoldering aloofness . There were times , I thought , when he gave off a dangerous glow , like fire in a jar , rectitude squeezed inside muscle -- a physicality I envied . On the surface , at least , things were neutral between us . I lived in one world , Herbie in another , and our childhood was never a topic of discussion . There were no topics at all . In school , or at church , his eyes swept across me as if I were air ; he avoided me at parties , rarely even nodded when we happened to cross paths on a sidewalk . In a way , it seemed , my old pal had willfully erased me from memory , along with our joint history , and I have since come to suspect that this was a means of wiping away his own shame , obliterating guilt by obliterating me . I was invisible to him : not even a ghost . All this changed when I began dating Lorna Sue in the middle of my junior year . To put it simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in classes and the cafeteria , I could feel him glaring at me like an Old Testament judge , wary and suspicious , alert to sin , his bright gray eyes locking onto me with what can only be called loathing . When I complained to Lorna Sue , she laughed and told me to forget it . " That 's Herbie , " she said . " That 's not us . " I nodded . " Maybe . But it feels strange . " " Just ignore him , " she said . " Pretend you do n't notice . It 'll drive him crazy . " " I do n't want him crazy . " Lorna Sue shrugged and went silent . " All right , I 'll talk to him , " she finally said , then hesitated . " Except I do n't think . . . I mean , I do n't think you 'll ever please him . Nobody can . That 's how he is . " " How ? " " You know . The big brother . " " Okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's something else too . It feels like -- I do n't know-almost like he owns you . " " Well , he does n't , " said Lorna Sue , but again there was a wrinkle in her voice , as if she was afraid of something . She held up the palm of her left hand , displaying a small , star-shaped , purply-red scar . " The opposite , Tommy . I own him . " I nodded and said , " Right . " Lorna Sue said , " Right . " But what she meant , exactly , was a puzzle to me , and always will be . From that point onward , well into adulthood , Herbie seemed possessed by a sullen , brooding jealousy , as if I had stolen his sister from him or somehow defiled her . Even when Lorna Sue and I were alone -- in a movie theater , in my father 's Pontiac -- I could sense his shadow nearby : a drop in the temperature , a pressure against my spine . It 's a mystery . Four decades have passed , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not begin to understand the causes . All I know is this : I am alone now . Herbie killed my marriage . He murdered love . Intentionally . Systematically . He found the weakness in me , and he showed it to Lorna Sue . Why me ? I can not help but wonder . I deserved better . By any estimate I am a man of some majesty , tall and eye-catching , no paunch , no deficits worth the spill of ink . I am a full professor of linguistics , the author of twenty-one highly regarded monographs ; I am beloved by my students , esteemed by my academic confederates . And , yes -- beyond everything -- I adored Lorna Sue with every fiery corpuscle of my being . So why ? In my bleakest moods , when black gets blackest , I think of it as raw perversion : Herbie coveted his own sister . Which is a fact . The stone truth . He was in love with her . More generously , I will sometimes concede that it was not sexual love , or not entirely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penitent , a torturer turned savior . Partly , too , I am quite certain that Herbie secretly associated me with his own guilt . I was present at the beginning . My backyard , my plywood , my green paint . And it was my father who had failed to deliver an airplane engine , who had instead brought home a turtle named Toby . Toby : it 's an obscenity to me . I lie awake nights , mulling things over . Surely the Catholics were involved . That 's another one -- Catholic . I fall sick driving past churches . I see a priest , I think divorce . Catholic . I am full of hatred . And this too : yellow . Even color gets colored . Lemon drops taste like betrayal . " Die ! " Herbie used to yell , then he 'd bank into an imaginary bombing run toward his big yellow house . That house : big and spooky and broken down , three stories plus an attic , and even as a kid I knew things were not happy inside . Too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The unmowed lawn . The screen windows patched up with newspapers and packing tape . In the hallways and living areas I detected the smell of mildew , a corrupt , musty stink , like the tombs of some abandoned old necropolis . On the walls -- in virtually every room -- were framed photographs of Herbie and Lorna Sue . In most cases they stood side by side , brother and sister , but in poses that suggested something vaguely beatific , almost saintly , like a pair of child martyrs : fingers interlocked , gazes elevated . This house -- this mausoleum -- was their place , foreign to me , and sinister . I hated it . I hated its theirness . Let me offer an instance . A night back in high school , junior year : Lorna Sue and I had parked in her driveway after a late movie . ( Radio music , a gauzy half-moon , my father 's green Pontiac . ) Lorna Sue had pulled off her shirt and bra , always an astonishing moment , and I was lost in all the plenitude . Breasts were new to me -- I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realized that Lorna Sue was crying . Not loud . A whimper . After a moment she seemed to shudder , then she pushed me away , hunched forward , and slipped her shirt on . I remember reaching out , half apologizing , but Lorna Sue twisted sideways in her seat . " Stop , " she said . " just please stop . " " I did n't mean --  " " They 're watching . " Lorna Sue motioned at the house . A large bay window overlooked the driveway , perhaps ten feet away , and in the dark I could make out five or six white faces pressed up against the glass . The features were blurry . Like clouded moons : hazy , round , softly lighted . There was a noise , I remember , which must have been laughter , and then the faces began vanishing one by one , each flickering out in turn , like the candles on an altar being extinguished by some ghostly celebrant . After a few seconds only a single face remained , which even in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost nodded . Unnatural , to say the least , and for whatever reasons it occurred to me that this entire family was in love with Lorna Sue , or obsessed by her , or caught up in some perverse form of idolatry . Those faces at the window . The scar on her hand . The evidence of intuition . In the driveway that night , Lorna Sue sat motionless for a time , cradling her chest . " That house , " she whispered . " God , that house . " The next day Herbie approached me after school . " Hey , Don Juan , " he said . He stared at me for longer than was comfortable , ice in his eyes , then he opened up a brown paper bag , reached inside , and passed over to me the Indian-head ornament off my father 's Pontiac . A cryptic moment . Frightening too . Herbie 's eyes -- so full of love , so full of hatred . And years later , when Lorna Sue announced her plans for divorce , she would give me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if there were things I could never understand . We were married for two fascinating decades . She divorced me eight months ago . Why ? The answer is convoluted . ( Keep in mind your own tangled history , how your husband flew off to Fiji in the company of a redhead barely half his age . Confusing , yes ? Loose ends ? Numerous unknowns ? ) In my own case , I had hidden certain mildly incriminating documents beneath the mattress of our bed -- Lorna Sue 's and mine . These materials were perfectly safe , I reasoned , for in our twenty years together I had yet to see Lorna Sue turn that mattress , or replace the box springs , or otherwise investigate the regions of our love . Mattress . The word chills me . How Herbie came to discover my private papers is difficult to imagine , and I lie sleepless at night , violated , envisioning his stealth . They 're watching , she had said . He 's watching . The documents themselves were unimportant . Evidence of minor deceit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artifacts from my life . If he knew about the documents -- their whereabouts , their implications -- what else had he invaded ? What else did he know ? And by what means ? Did he steal a key ? Was he snooping even last winter , while Lorna Sue and I vacationed in Tampa ? Outside Tampa , to be literal , at a resort called Seaside Dunes , where we played minigolf and browned ourselves in the sunlight , and where one afternoon Lorna Sue befriended a certain hairy gentleman whose name I have vowed never again to utter . ( It is a promise , however , often broken in my thoughts . Kersten . Whom she calls Kerr . Whom I call shit . Preposterous name , oily personality . ) At what precise instant , I wonder , did Lorna Sue fall in love with him ? And out of love with me ? When the gentleman sucked in his belly ? When he approached our patch of sand without invitation ? When he removed his shirt and puffed out his chest and introduced himself with those two vile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not then . The arms of conscious liaison probably opened later , several months after we had returned , on that humid evening when Herbie retrieved my secrets from beneath our mattress . I wonder , too , how long Herbie stalked me . Did he steal into my bedroom ? Did he open cupboards , sniff my laundry , shake out books , finally take notice of our king-size mattress ? Who knows ? In truth , I must admit , I had been pushing my luck for many weeks , terrified of discovery , aware of the consequences . No doubt I should have relocated my incriminating cache . Or destroyed it . And yet , as so often happens , ordinary life conspired against common sense . ( I am a teacher . I have stress syndrome . I married a woman with a hole in her hand . ) The point is this : daily flux presents its own ample store of worries , even without betrayal , and in this instance I postponed an act of simple sanity and self-preservation . I delayed . I forgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay on our brass bed like a losing hand of poker . " There , " said Herbie , " is your angel . " My transgression ? A misdemeanor by any standard . After our return from Tampa , Lorna Sue had withdrawn inside herself , going quiet and preoccupied , and in a very real sense , I believe , she was still sitting on that sunny beach , still chatting with her handsome new friend , still giggling at the hairy bastard 's offensive little jokes . ( I was there , for God 's sake . I feigned sleep . I listened to the frothy sounds of surf and seduction . ) In any case , she had detached herself from me , and I felt her absence as surely as I had once felt her thereness , her everness , her absolute and indestructible love . ( If a love dies , how can such love be love ? By what linguistic contrivance ? ) And so I began to sound the vastness of Lorna Sue 's absence , or the stirrings of discontent , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife contemplates a furry , pompous , pre-embalmed , ridiculously well-tanned tycoon . The signs were everywhere . She was not merely absentminded ; she was absent . She was seeking an excuse , I believe , and Herbie promptly provided her with a very tidy one . On that humid evening he rang the doorbell . He had the nerve to shake my hand . He kissed Lorna Sue . He marched directly to our bedroom , to our brass bed , and without emotion he raided my life . He dropped the documents on our handmade checkered quilt . " Angel , " he said . As mentioned , my crime was minor . Certainly pardonable by love . The documents were these : fourteen uncashed checks made out to one Dr. Ralph Constantine . A psychiatrist . A phony psychiatrist , actually , whose name I had invented . What was I trying to prove ? My equilibrium , no doubt . That it was unfair of her to suggest that our troubles were caused by my own jealousy and paranoia . And so I had concocted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save a marriage . Not so horrible , do you think ? " Angel -- your deceiving angel , " said Herbie , who then shrugged and strolled out of our bedroom and left me with a future no longer worth pursuing . ( Do not forget : Herbie worshiped Lorna Sue . Adoration in the biblical sense . He wanted his sister back . ) For months , especially after our return from Tampa , Lorna Sue had been insisting that I seek help . Her phrase : " Seek help . " And so like my father -- like all of us at one time or another -- I had issued a promise that could not be honored . I did not need a counselor . I was n't blind , I was n't sick . Nor was I crazy . Granted , I had taken to fervent noontide praying ; I had begun talking in colors -- that 's how Lorna Sue described it -- at least in my sleep . But she had left me . She had absented herself , drifting away , dreaming of a tycoon , and none of this was the product of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and still do , and always will , because that is love , the unending alwaysness , and I therefore wished only to please her , to reduce her absence , to pretend I was under the care of a fictitious shrink by the name of Dr. Ralph Constantine . All this in the hope of winning back the love I had felt dissolving on a beach outside Tampa . A few weeks after the divorce I paid a covert visit to Lorna Sue and her new husband . Watched from a distance as she squeezed the gentleman 's arm outside a real-estate office in downtown Tampa . He 's a high roller . Lorna Sue seems proud of that . She 's well dressed . Expensive jewelry , tanned skin , very beautiful . Herbie lives nearby . Watchful . I give the marriage two years . One last example . The word mice . Plural and ridiculous . When I was twelve , Lorna Sue got angry at me for kissing a girl named Faith Graffenteen . " I did n't mean to , " I told her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You kissed her face , " Lorna Sue said . " You kissed her snotty nose . " " I did n't mean that either , " I said , then waited a moment . " So did Faith like it ? " " God , no , " said Lorna Sue . " She puked mice . And do n't ever try it with me , Tommy . " " Who wants to ? " I said . " You . " We were walking down North Fourth Street . Past Mrs. Catchitt 's house . Past St. Paul 's Catholic Church . It was Christmas break , no school for two weeks . " It just makes me sick , " said Lorna Sue . " I mean , you kissed her snot . That 's what Faith said -- you almost sucked out all her snot . And not just Faith either . You kissed Beth . You kissed Linda and Corinne and Ruthie and Pam and I do n't even know who else . And you wrote their names down . I found your stupid list . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pretty sickening . You 're not even a teenager yet . " I tucked the list in my pocket . Lorna Sue had her brother 's temper , her brother 's sensitivity to injustice . We kept walking . " So why ? " she finally said . " Faith made me , " I said . " Besides , I 'll bet you kissed almost everybody . That time with Dennis in the warming house . That time with Jerry Powell . " " They love me , " Lorna Sue said . " Not Dennis . Dennis does n't . " Lorna Sue frowned . " You want to kiss me ? " " No . " " Well , do n't even dare . Herbie 'll kill you . " We stopped in front of her house . Lorna Sue slipped her bad hand into a parka pocket . " Do you love Faith ? " " Probably , " I said . " She still forced me . " " For how long ? " " Just the regular time . Barely a second -- it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , " Lorna Sue said . " I mean , how long will you love her ? " " I do n't know . For a while . " " But God , she puked mice ! Rabbit guts and mice . " " All right , " I said . " I 'll stop . " " Do you love me ? " " I guess so . " Lorna Sue laughed . " Herbie 'll kill you .
