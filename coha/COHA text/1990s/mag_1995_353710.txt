Margaret Dammann Eisner has often been described as a world-class competitive woman , which suggests that her son 's triumph last week owes something to genes . When young Michael was growing up in a Park Avenue apartment , his parents borrowed a Picasso from an art-dealer friend to hang in Michael 's room . It was called Bullfight . The man who would come to influence , perhaps more than anyone else alive , what Americans see at the movie theater or in their homes , was allowed to watch one hour of television a day  --  after he had read for two hours . <P> When dinner was over , Eisner went to the law firm Dewey Ballantine to iron out the final niceties of Disney 's $19 billion deal to buy Capital Cities/ABC .
