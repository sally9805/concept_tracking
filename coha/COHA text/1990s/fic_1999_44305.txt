ELINOR HAD EVERYTHING IN HER LIFE IN PLACE . THEN , ON A VISIT WITH HER AUNT , SHE MET A HANDSOME STRANGER . - AND SUDDENLY , THINGS DID N'T SEEM SO SIMPLE ANYMORE ... <p> Pelargonium , " said Aunt Mae , who was sitting by the fire with her niece , her knitting in her lap . " What 's that ? " inquired Elinor . " What 's what , dear ? " her aunt asked . " That Word ... pelargonium ? " " Did I say pelargonium ? I 've noticed my mind often thinks p 's . " Elinor was accustomed to her aunt 's odd words , spoken apropos of nothing . At any time , Mae Curry might look up and say " haymaker " or " tertiary , " something quite unconnected to anything they 'd been discussing . The words were always accompanied by a vague stare , as if Mae , a novelist , were peering inward and had severed all connections with her actual surroundings . She seemed to be especially fond of words with five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , " said Aunt Mae . " They simply must be rolled around on the tongue . " How trim and beautiful her aunt had once been , and how thick and stocky she 'd become in recent years , Elinor thought . Aunt Mae 's books , however , were published with dust jackets displaying the same photograph that had appeared on her first novel . In it , a slim young widow with a heart-shaped face and an intense gaze sat on a garden bench with a large hat resting on her knees . Elinor could not imagine what her aunt 's readers thought upon meeting Mae Mansfield Curry at a book signing if the only image they had of her was 35 years old . Now when she swept onto a stage with her long , shapeless dress billowing around her sizable frame , one was awed in the way one might be when seeing a luxury liner heave into port . " Something to do , I think , with geraniums , " murmured Elinor , who had taken Lip a knitting project of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holiday in her aunt 's cottage in the village of Lavenwold . " What is that , dear ? " " Pelargoniums . " Aunt Mae peered at her inquisitively , squinting . " Never mind , " said Elinor . " You know what I 've decided to do ? " Elinor looked tip . It was impossible not to be interested in what her aunt might say next . " When my literary agent retires , I 'm going to look for a new one with a lot of loops in his handwriting , especially his g 's and p 's . Generous loops are a sign of someone who 's passionate . " She picked up her knitting with renewed enthusiasm . " Now , then ! " she said , satisfied with her plan . " Why not go ahead and seek a new agent now ? " Elinor asked . " Why plod on with a man with a heart of stone when one might have a man of fire ? " It was a question she had often asked herself about her four-year engagement to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exactly . That was clearly a characteristic of coldness , and Axel could never be accused of being cold , only of being dull-which was , in truth , even worse . " Well , of course , I could n't do that , my dove , " Aunt Mae said . " One must have loyalties in a disloyal world . My agent has done very well by me over the years . It 's just that he makes it such a stiff thing when it could be jolly fun . " Elinor sighed . Why was she spending her holiday making a sweater for Axel , who was , himself , rather a stiff thing ? Had her life become so wretchedly vacuous that she spent her holidays thinking about a man she found dull ? Of course , it could be said that she was observing loyalties of her own in a disloyal world . I hope , " she said , feeling a desire to confide in her aunt , " that Axel might ... might give me a great hug for knitting this cardigan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stingy with his hugs , " her aunt said flatly . Elinor stiffened ; it was always a small shock to hear plain speaking . " Well , yes . A hug from him is rather rare . " Aunt Mae looked up from her knitting . " There 's a great deal to be said about the Golden Rule in such cases , I believe . If you would like a great hug , as you say , perhaps you need to give him one . Show him what a great hug is , after all , since he seems not to know . " " Oh , " Elinor said . " Well .... " She could see Axel dashing out of her flat in London and into the street , quite alarmed over The Great Hug . Her aunt stirred her bulk in the chair . " And good riddance ! " she said . Sometimes , Elinor felt as if her aunt could read her mind . " SPRAY THE LEAF MINERS , " PROCLAIMED Mae as she trooped down the stairs in a denim dress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do in the garden . " Rake around the fish pond . " Elinor , up since dawn , was drinking tea at the bay window overlooking the street , watching the butcher open his shop . All she could see from where she sat was a hand going in and out of the window . " Hello , my lovely aunt , " she said brightly . " Come , let 's have a great hug , " said Mae , stretching forth her arms . Elinor flew into them , laughing . " Lovely ! " announced her aunt . " Are you in the garden all morning ? " " Yes , and I think you should go out and get some fresh air , " she said , waving her hand . " Stretch your legs , have a manicure-oh , and do pop into the card shop . Let everyone know Mae Curry 's niece is back again . " " I 'll do all that , and maybe a wee stop at the library . Will you be working today , or shall we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Her aunt was clearly confused . Elinor found during her holidays that her aunt either wrote for eight or more hours each day , like a fiend , or appeared to forget about writing altogether . " You know , at Your desk . " " Oh ! " cried Mae . " Of course ! Right after lunch , we 'll nip down to the green for a nice trot , then I 'll come home and pound away " til teatime . How 's that ? " " Perfect I 've had breakfast , so I 'm off in ten minutes . May I fetch anything for you ? " " Nothing , dear , " said Aunt Mae , thumping down the hall in her clogs . " Work bonemeal around the roses . Hoick those blasted cosmos by the downspout . " EVERY YEAR , ELINOR SPENT SEVERAL POUNDS in Miss Severs 's card shop on stationery , a blank journal , and a new pen . This morning , she also chose a ream of recycled writing paper from America . She could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( xx ) , and green in a forest in Oregon or Montana . " But perhaps there are n't any trees in Montana , " said Elinor , musing over which pen to buy . I beg Your pardon ? " " Trees in Montana . Do you think Montana has trees ? " " Montana , " Miss Severs said thoughtfully . I should n't think so . That 's where a great many cowboys are , and I ca n't remember seeing trees in films about cowboys , can you ? " Elinor admitted she could not , and chose a pen that moved across the page like silk . Elinor Bakerstaff Rawlings , she wrote on the flyleaf of her journal . I suppose your aunt has had her share of bother since the last book . " " Yes , actually , her readers wo n't leave her alone , " Elinor said . " Somehow they 've even gotten her unpublished phone number , and only this morning there was a wilted nosegay on the doorstep with a note from a fan . They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands it . " " And what did you think of A Celestial Heart ? " Miss Severs 's glasses slipped down her long nose as she stared at Elinor , expectant . " Well , it was ... different , do n't you think ? " " I sold fourteen copies before they were out of the shipping box . I 'd say there 's a great deal more ... love interest in this one , would n't you ? " Elinor laughed . " Suffice it to say that page ninety-seven secured my rapt attention . " Miss Severs blushed . ELINOR HAD PLANNED TO HAVE A MANIcure after the library , but two full hours slipped away so quickly among the tall shelves that it was nearly eleven o'clock when she presented her books to the librarian . Elinor handed over a Jane Austen , an obscure English poet named Charles Edington , a Barbara Pym , and the collected hymns of Charles Wesley . The librarian removed the cards and spread them on her desk to be signed . Elinor could never resist scanning the list of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above her signature on each of the cards , appeared the name J.D. Wellington , written in a hasty , right  --  leaning slant . Hom odd that one person should have borrowed precisely the same books she was borrowing . " J.D. Wellington , " she Murmured aloud . " John Wellington ? " the librarian said . " That 's Mr. Wellington right over there , reading the Times . " She turned and peered into the silent reading room . A man sat in a leather armchair , hidden behind a newspaper . What an extraordinary coincidence , she thought . Some old man , quite likely , with failing eyes , who sat every evening with an afghan over his knees , reading and poking up the fire . But what bizarre shoes for an old man , she mused , rather like saddle oxfords . She could not help observing , as she handed back the cards , that the loop of Mr. Wellington 's g was nicely rounded and full , reaching to the line underneath where she 'd written her own signature . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to mention berg , was disappointingly spare . " Spinsterish , " she murmured . I beg your pardon ? " said the librarian . " My f 's and g , " replied Elinor , putting the books into her carry bag and walking briskly to the door . SHE WAS COMING OUT OF THE POST OFFICE with her change in her hand when she heard a coin strike the pavement . It had to be the pound , she reckoned , feeling the five-pence still in her palm . It was not at her feet- , it must have rolled away . But where ? She leaned over to look , when she saw the shoes appear . Whereever had she seen those shoes before ? " Excuse me , but I saw it fall into the drainpipe . " " Oh , dear , " she said , straightening up . " Well , then ...... She looked into the most dazzling blue eyes she 'd ever seen , eyes the color of a clear , bright lake , perhaps , or a cornflower . " Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pound in her hand . " Oh , but I couldn't. - " she said , with a kind of wonder . " Of course You can . Taking money from strangers has gotten a bad name . But some say it can bring good luck . " He was tall and slender , and his speech seemed to come straight from the American movies she 'd seen as a child . " John Wellington , " he said . " Otherwise known as J.DY " " The same . " " But you 've been reading the very books I 've just taken out . " She lifted her book bag toward him as if to prove it . " Let 's see . That might have been a Jane Austen , a Barbara Pym , the hymns of Charles Wesley , and a Charles Edington . " She tilted her head to one side , smiting . " Why on earth Would you be reading Edington ? No one reads him anymore . " " We do , " he said , laughing . She could not bear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth , I 'm Currently reading lots of writers that are n't very popular these days , " he said . " I 'm a professor of English literature at a university in the States , doing a treatise on the village novel . I think its time is coming .. again . " " Lovely ! I hope so . Well , good-bye , I was just going to lunch . " He walked with her . " Why do n't you come to lunch with me ? " Americans are always bold and impetuous , she thought . " But I 'm having lunch with my aunt , just over there . " She pointed to the house behind the rose hedges . " Mae Curry is your aunt ? " " For more years than I care to confess . " " I 've wanted very much to meet your aunt , but I hear she 's bombarded with fans . " " There 's a lock now on the front gate , " Elinor confided , " and a very complicated alarm system . Aunt Mae was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirror over the mantel . She saw the reflection of two women peering in at her . Their eyes went tip and down with her cake fork . They were mesmerized ... until Aunt Mae suddenly raced toward the window , barking like a terrier , which is one of her specialties . They ran , Of Course , but they trampled the pansies . " She saw lines Suddenly appear around his eyes when he laughed . Crinkles ! she thought . " Perhaps you ' I join us for tea at four ? " She had n't meant to say that at all ; it Simply flew out when she opened her mouth , like a bird from a cage . " I 'd like that enormously . " " Do you have a tweed jacket with leather patches at the elbows ? " " I do . " " Will you wear it ? It will make you look professorial , and Aunt Mae does like anything beginning with p . " " I 'll be there , " he said , amused . She turned from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's your name ? " he called after her . " Elinor , " she called back . " Elinor Bakerstaff Rawlings . " It MET AN AMERICAN PROFESSOR , AND HE 'S coming to tea . " It sounded as if everything she 'd just said might have been one long word with many strange syllables . " You 're wonderfully flushed ! " said her aunt , with satisfaction . Elinor flung her book bag onto the window seat and sat down with a thump . " I told him you hark like a terrier . " " A spaniel , dear , a spaniel . " " He 's longing to meet you , but he respects your privacy . " " That 's good of him . You should have seen who was hanging over the garden wall while I hoicked the Cosmos , " No ! Hanging over the wall ? " " Like so many monkeys . Part of a book club . They had the gall to stand on the ladder they removed from my toolshed . Four of them , and not one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked at her niece . I declare , you 're a picture sitting there in the light . So like your mother . " " I miss her , " Elinor said . " I miss both your parents so keenly . I find I always have something to tell them , something no one else will quite understand . ( Ocasionally , I write these fragments in a little journal , which I 'll give to you one day . " Elinor rose and kissed her aunt , who smelled of rosemary and leaf mold . " We 're having lunch on the terrace , dear . I 've filled two water guns , so if we see heads peering over the wall .... " " Bang ! Bang ! " said Elinor . THE AFTERNOON HAD GROWN OVERCAST , and Aunt Mae 's maid , Loma , had turned on the lamps in the library , where Elinor sat with her aunt , the unfinished cardigan unattended in her lap . When the bell rang , she rose so hastily that her knitting rolled to the floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Aunt Mae . Elinor colored and sat down . Her parents had never had a maid to answer a bell or serve a meal , like Aunt Mae . " Mae Curry has everything but pretensions , " her mother once said kindly of her sister-in-law . John Wellington brought something compelling into the room , Elinor thought , but she could n't have said what . Vigor , perhaps-There was a quick certainty about him , in his eyes , his smile , the way he went at once to her aunt and bowed slightly . " It 's a great pleasure , " he said , taking the hand Mae extended . " The pleasure , frankly , is all ours , " she said . " It 's a house full of females , even to the cat and my old corgi . Please sit down , Professor Wellington , and we 'll get straightaway to tea . " " Wonderful , " he said , " I 'm famished . Reading musty books provokes the appetite . " He grinned at Elinor , discreetly displaying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hello , again , " he said , sitting across the tea table from her in a slipcovered armchair . That his hair was thinning away from his forehead seemed comforting somehow . He looked the sort , she thought , who might be lovely to his mother or go see his children in school plays . Her aunt poured a fragrant blend of tea into her guest 's cup . " It 's odd to think nearly all books become musty , forgotten in some damp basement in a village library , or sold at a jumble sale . " Elinor thought she heard a rare note of wistfulness in Mae 's voice . " Yours wo n't be forgotten . I 'm sure of it ! " she said with feeling . Her aunt laughed . " TWO Sugars , Professor ? I think I 've at last stopped believing I could write something that might go the distance . If I can give my readers a few pleasant hours , well , then , that is enough . " " It is more than enough , " John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my opinion . " She smiled . " I 'm not myself today . Please forgive me . They were coming at me over the garden fence . Headline : " Happy Endings Book Club Wiped Out by Enraged Author . Meeting Postponed . ' " The rain began with their laughter . There was no faint , warning patter against the panes . It came down Suddenly , rattling the drains with its volume , nearly drowning their voices . " There goes my bonemeal , seeping into the beds ! " said Mae . " Timing ... , " said their guest . " Is everything ! " said Elinor . " Now , tell LIS , Professor Wellington , just what it is you 're up to in Lavenwold . " Their contented hostess stirred two cubes of sugar into a steaming CLIP . He settled more comfortably into the chair . " Please call me John . Actually , I 'm writing a paper on the village novel , and one of England 's oldest villages seemed the perfect setting to do a bit of research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Mae . " Yet while the village novel is May wine , Your books are old brandy . I 've just read A Celestial Heart and like it very much . I think it 's your finest hour . " " I 'm tempted to agree with you , John , but no , this dear girl is my finest hour . " She beamed at Elinor , who flushed with pleasure . " She 's all the family I have , and her visits are a great tonic for me . " " I once had a niece visit me , " lie said , and it was exhausting . But , of course , she was fourteen and full of teenage angst , and there was a torrent of sighing - and tears . " " I find sighing the worst son of bother , " said Mae . " I 've never been troubled with that in Elinor . She was always a happy and resourceful child , a reader . Actually , I wrote rny first story for you , dear , do you remember ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , very intent and sober , and regretted that she did n't remember . " It was about pigs , " Mae went on . I did n't know it , but YOU 'd once been chased by a pig , and your mother told me you hated the story . " " Timing ... , " said their guest . " Is everything ! " said Elinor , laughing . Mae refilled their cups as the rain lashed the windows . " And have you found good lodging in Lavenwold ? " she asked John . " I 've got rooms in Abbey Lane , " he said . " I oil in the library and hammer away at my laptop . A soft life , but soon to be over , like most good things . " " Oh , dear . Not very soon , I hope , " Mae said . I leave on Saturday . " Elinor felt her heart beat dully as Lorna came in with the tea trolley . Thin slices of orange cake , freshly made shortbread , and a plate of thickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointment she felt . When her aunt left the room to fetch a signed copy of her book , their guest rose and stood with his back to the fire . I know that Americans are somewhat brutish in their social behavior , but I would like to ask you a direct question . " " Yes , do , " said Elinor , measuring his shoulders with her eyes . " Where have you been these last weeks , Miss Rawlings ? I was searching for you everywhere . " " Well , I just came up from London on Sunday . " " And this is Monday . Well , Of Course , that 's the answer . " " You have four days , " she exclaimed , without thinking . " And five nights , " he said , the crinkles appearing around his eyes . Mae swept into the room , carrying her book , " There ! All done ! " As Elinor watched John Wellington take the book from her aunt and open it to the flyleaf , it occurred to her that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more stitches to enlarge the armholes.Then she could widen the shoulders an inch ... or , perhaps , two .
