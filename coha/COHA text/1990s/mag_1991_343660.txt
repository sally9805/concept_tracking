The art market is in a tailspin , but no one would know it from the attention lavished on one item auctioned in Manhattan last week . Objet-Dard , a 1962 Marcel Duchamp bronze casting owned by the estate of the late graffiti artist Keith Haring , was listed in the Christie 's catalog at a cautiously low estimate of $8,000 to $10,000 . ( The title of the frankly phallic piece is a pun on objet d'art , substituting the French word for dart . ) In a matter of seconds , bids for the 8-in. work soared into six figures in a battle between two unseen telephone bidders . The winning offer : $135,000 from a Belgian art dealer .
