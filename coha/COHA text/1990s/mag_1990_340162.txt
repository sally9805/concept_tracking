Ask most small investors if they would put money in junk bonds , and they would probably respond with a hearty no . But anyone who has a deposit in a savings and loan , holds an annuity from an insurance company , is vested in a pension plan , makes contributions to certain mutual funds or participates in a 401(k) retirement program probably has some exposure to the risk of junk bonds . In most cases , that is no cause for alarm . But in a few instances , investors have good reason to be wary . <P> Despite their name , junk bonds  --  more politely known as high-yield , high- risk bonds  --  often serve a useful financial purpose . Companies that are too small to issue blue-chip bonds can use high-yield securities to raise money for expansion . Because their debt is considered riskier than the bonds of their larger brethren , the junk issuers must pay five percentage points or more above the prime rate . <P> During most of the decade , junk-bond defaults ran at an annual rate of only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaky , some analysts predict that defaults could hit 10% to 15% of the $200 billion market this year . <P> While S &Ls; own 7% of all junk bonds , depositors will be shielded from loss if a thrift runs into trouble because the Government insures deposits up to $100,000 . But the junk-bond slump could increase the already enormous taxpayer cost of the Bush Administration 's S &L; bailout package ( anywhere from $160 billion to $300 billion ) , since the Government will have to sell the securities at a loss . <P> Mutual funds own 30% of all junk bonds . Funds that promise " high income " or " high yield " are generally the ones that invest heavily in junk . Most prudent fund managers have been switching during the past year to more creditworthy issues , including Kroger and Fort Howard Paper . Yet the depressed market value of most junk securities means that fund investors who sell out now " will take some pretty substantial losses , " according to Brian Ternoey , an employee-benefits consultant in Princeton , N.J. , who advises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Insurance companies own another 30% of junk bonds . While most firms concentrate no more than 8% of their assets in the securities , a few have gone beyond the safety zone . Junk bonds account for more than 35% of the $19 billion in assets held by First Executive of Los Angeles.The firm 's heavy reliance on junk may make it difficult for First Executive to meet its obligations , thus posing a danger to retirement funds that the company manages . <P> Pension-fund holders should beware if their employer has terminated its retirement plan  --  usually to tap excess cash  --  and replaced it with an annuity , a kind of insurance policy that pays income to the company 's retirees on a regular basis . Revlon got its hands on $100 million in 1986 , when it closed out its pension fund and bought an $85 million annuity  --  from First Executive . A safety net protects employees in most states , which have agencies that insure private pension funds against default . The Federal Government guarantees many pensions as well . But it is uncertain how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by annuities . A few annuity holders could find their benefits drastically reduced .
