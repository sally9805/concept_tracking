<p> THE re-erection of a 100-year-old monument that commemorates a bloody battle in this city during the painful years after the Civil War is sparking angry disputes . <p> The Liberty Monument - a 20-foot-tall granite obelisk that recalls a violent confrontation in New Orleans between the Reconstruction administration and several hundred white residents , many of whom were former Confederate soldiers - has long been a subject of controversy among civil rights and Civil War enthusiasts here . <p> Originally erected in 1891 , the monument has become a focal point of racial attitudes , not only because it honors the fighters of the White League - a militaristic group that many historians believe operated similarly to the Ku Klux Klan - but also because for years a plaque on the monument stated that the presidential election of 1876 , which effectively ended Reconstruction , " recognized white supremacy and gave us our state . " <p> After the monument was dismantled and sent to a warehouse in 1989 , ostensibly to permit street repairs around its downtown site , a local pharmacist successfully sued in federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The court 's decision won the support of many national and local preservationists , who say that whatever the racial implications of the monument might be , it is a part of history and should not be permanently removed . <p> " You just have a bunch of people in this town who want to play with history , " says Hope Labrano , a spokesperson for the Friends of the Liberty Monument , a group that applauded the city 's decision to put the monument back up ( in a different location ) . " This is a monument that celebrates the people of this city who fought off a government that was imposed on them . That 's all it is , even though these critics keep bringing up the racial issue . " <p> Whether or not race originally was a factor in the dispute , it became one after former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke appeared at the rededication ceremonies for the monument in early March . <p> " We may be a minority in this city , " Mr. Duke said of New Orleans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we still have rights . We still have the right to assemble . And this ceremony is dedicated to those who died to protect those rights . " <p> " It was good to see ol ' David Duke there at the Liberty Monument , because he and the people who support that thing are one and the same , " says the Rev. Avery Alexander , a long-time civil rights activist who is also a state representative . " These are people who live in another century ... They want to go back to a time when blacks truly were an oppressed people , and both Duke and this monument give them hope . " <p> Although Duke 's political star in Louisiana has been in decline , the Liberty Monument 's star has been ascending owing to the support it has received from various civic and preservation groups . <p> " We do n't get involved in politics much , but when it comes to tearing down a monument that has been standing for more than a century in this city , we decided we just had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Louisiana Historical Society . " You ca n't go around destroying statues and monuments because of the political atmosphere of the day . Where would it end ? " <p> Liberty Monument supporters , some of whom are descendants of the men who fought in what is known as the " Battle of Liberty Place , " say an understanding of what Reconstruction rule in New Orleans was like is essential to appreciate the monument . <p> This view of history puts the era in a harsh light : Not only were white citizens of New Orleans under the rule of the Yankees , and even of some blacks who were formerly slaves , but they also labored under a heavy property-tax load that caused many whites to lose their property . <p> The swift evaporation of financial security , coupled with the daily indignity of being bossed around by the enemy victors from the war , motivated talks of rebellion . With a national recession lending fuel to the fire , the White League decided to take a stand in September 1874 . <p> Thousands of whites marched to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took control of state offices . But President Ulysses S. Grant sent in a far larger federal militia , backed by a squadron of six warships anchored at the Port of New Orleans , and the White Leaguers surrendered . <p> The struggle resulted in 27 deaths and more than 100 injuries , mostly during the initial battle . But it could be said that the White League ultimately won : In 1876 Reconstruction was ended by a deal to garner Southern electoral votes for Rutherford B. Hayes , who won that year 's presidential election despite trailing in the popular vote . <p> Most historians agree that the White League was a racist organization . Eric Foner , in his award-winning 1988 book , " Reconstruction : America 's Unfinished Revolution , " says that the White League was " openly dedicated to the violent restoration of white supremacy . " <p> In " Creole New Orleans , " published last year , Joseph Logsdon , a professor of history at the University of New Orleans , notes that white Louisianians " in desperate frustration banded together in 1874 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supremacy , with predictable consequences of violence . " <p> But other scholars , such as Tulane University history Prof. Judith Schaefer , have argued that the " Battle of Liberty Place " needs to be put into historical perspective . For many older white New Orleanians , Dr. Schaefer said at a recent meeting of the Louisiana Historical Society , the monument is a structure of inspiration because it honors citizens who banded together to fight against what was viewed as a totalitarian rule . She also acknowledged , however , that the monument sparks a different reaction amo ng black residents . " Some compromise must be reached , " Schaefer said , pointing out that the plaque lauding white supremacy has been removed . <p> But for 82-year-old activist Alexander , who once marched with Martin Luther King Jr. , and was arrested for disrupting the monument 's rededication ceremonies , the only compromise possible is one that results in the disappearance of the monument . <p> " It 's like the Confederate flag , " he says of the monument . " It 's something that people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a return to the Confederacy , can rally around . But every time they do , they are reminding us of the way things once were , of their love for those old , old days . " <p> City officials , who delayed re-erecting the monument for more than a year , say that , for now , the monument is here to stay , despite the protests . " The mayor sympathizes very much with those who are against it , " says Jinx Broussard , a spokesman for Mayor Sidney Barthelemy ( D ) . " But his hands are tied . We are under court order to keep it up . " <p> But Mr. Broussard says the civil rights activists should find comfort in the new spot selected for the monument : a small patch of land near the Mississippi River , removed from the city center . <p> " At least we got it somewhat out of view , " Broussard says .
