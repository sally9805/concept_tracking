<p> Play a game of free association with some undecided voters in Virginia 's U.S. Senate race and the impressions come fast and furious and firmly held . <p> Republican Oliver L. North ? " Lying . Extremist . Patriotic . Conservative . " Democratic incumbent Charles S. Robb ? " Adultery . Parties . A liberal who is trying to look conservative in a conservative state . " <p> What about independent candidate J. Marshall Coleman ? " A fresh face . The unknown . He is not Robb and he is not North . " <p> Theirs are the voices of some of the most sought-after voters in the Old Dominion , the ones who will make a difference in a contest that polls show is a dead heat between Robb and North . They are not angry voices , but unsettled and frustrated ones , unhappy about the choices on the ballot and uncertain whether the victor can help solve statewide problems or even everyday troubles . <p> Nine Northern Virginians agreed to a request from The Washington Post to discuss issues confronting them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the conversation ranged from the politicians ' fitness for office to grade inflation in Fairfax County schools and the safety of driving on the Capital Beltway . <p> The nine were recruited by a market research firm . Six were chosen because they were undecided in the Senate race ; the three others were Coleman supporters who said they could change their minds by Election Day . The firm sought Fairfax County residents who said they were certain to vote and who had an interest in politics . As it happened , all nine were white , ranging in age from mid-twenties to late forties . <p> Each had distinct views of the candidates , but collectively , they echoed findings of recent polls , which suggest that questions of character are overshadowing any discussion of issues . Members of the group generally were not familiar with where Coleman , North and Robb stood on issues . <p> There was a pervasive sense that life and politics no longer were comfortable and predictable . " It 's not a neighborhood county anymore , " said Pamela Julyan . She and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and a decline in the caliber of Virginia politicians in the 1990s . <p> " Many of us are undecided because I think we have a real dearth of moral fortitude in our politicians , " said Julyan , 42 , a political independent and former Capitol Hill staff member who is a homemaker in Great Falls . <p> " This election , or this race in particular , has sort of brought into a focus for me increasing dismay at the ability of government or politics to create ... the opportunity for moral recovery for the nation , " said Republican Greg Currey , 28 , of Fairfax , a civil engineer with the Environmental Protection Agency . <p> " This race in particular , with the problems of integrity , has been kind of discouraging for me . " <p> When they were asked to picture North , one image that came immediately to mind was the photo of the Marine Corps lieutenant colonel standing ramrod straight , right hand up , being sworn in to testify before the Senate . Yet as members of the group talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two very different men . <p> " It was a picture of a guy who has been through a tough time , had been lied to , had been grilled in front of Congress , " said Chuck Baker , 47 , a Herndon Democrat who works for the U.S. Treasury Department . " Maybe that is going to make him a better person to be a senator , because he knows what really goes on . " <p> " This guy stood up and said , ' I did this , and I 've done everything , and here I am , and take it or leave it ... love me or leave me , ' " said Allen Childress , a 25-year-old Republican from Vienna who works as a customer service representative for Virginia Power . <p> Pam Julyan saw a very different and flawed man . " When I look at Oliver North , I do not see a lot of personal integrity . ... I do n't think lying to Congress and then running for Congress is the right thing to do . " <p> Others said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really is . <p> " The most disturbing thing for me is not understanding what he was doing when he was sitting in front of Congress , lying to them or misleading them with whatever he was doing , " Greg Currey said . <p> Others say they feel the same way today , that despite North 's celebrity , they are not quite sure what he stands for or would do as the junior senator from Virginia . <p> " I called him a Republican Bill Clinton because he came from basically nowhere , got infamous and now he says all of what might be perceived as the right things to get elected , and this is what Bill Clinton did , " said Mike Clower , 35 , a Fairfax lawyer and an independent . <p> Clower said he has made a list of the promises that North has made . The list is so long that he 's left wondering , " How much of this is him , how much of it is just his agenda to get elected ? ... I think he is saying all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe he will do anything about it . " <p> " He seems attached to a lot of interest groups instead of genuine people , " Allen Childress said . <p> Others in the group suggested that in these days of cynicism and anger toward Congress , there 's a perverse appeal in sending North to the Senate . " I think that would be a message , " Chuck Baker said , smiling . <p> There was no real consensus on what kind of senator North would make . Some thought he would face few problems , and saw the recent endorsement by Senate Minority Leader Robert J. Dole as a clear signal he would be welcome in the GOP fold . Others disagreed . " I think he would be very ineffective , " Mike Clower said . " He is going to find himself all alone . " <p> For most in the group , the central question about Robb was not about his morals , but about his judgment . They laughed when reminded that Robb had said he received only a nude massage from one-time beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What Robb did is really a question of bad judgment , " Pam Julyan said . " I mean , he is certainly not the first senator that has had an affair . ... Getting caught at it and then taking the attitude that , ' Well , I sort of did it maybe a little , but I did n't quite do it all the way  --  and so is that okay ? To me that is really bad judgment . " <p> Bill Bell , 42 , an Oakton Republican who works for the Navy in Crystal City , agreed . He said Robb 's positions on most of the important issues were virtually identical to his own . But he would not commit to voting for a politician who acted as though voters could be so easily fooled . <p> " He handled the whole thing very poorly and made some statements where he was trying to define fidelity and it just seemed to me that he really was stretching , " Bell said . " He was in a corner . ... I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it 's a lot worse than bad judgment , " Greg Currey said . " I mean , I put that akin to North lying to Congress . If Robb did what we all seem to believe he did and he did n't tell his wife about it , was less than truthful with his wife , who is presumably the closest person to him , what makes us think that he is going to be any more truthful with nameless , faceless citizens of Virginia ? " <p> Several people said Robb had made little or no impression since his election to the Senate in 1988 . <p> Betty Ladd , 47 , a Vienna Democrat who works as an executive secretary in Tysons Corner , said , " I 'd like to know what he has done in six years , really . " <p> " Not a thing , " Mike Clower said . <p> Some also questioned Coleman 's character . They recalled vaguely that the former Republican state attorney general had softened his antiabortion stance during the 1980s . <p> " Has n't he flip-flopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Is n't there a question of integrity there ? If he is flip-flopping just for political gain and just to get elected , that shows no more integrity than anyone else . " <p> " I do n't know that changing your mind is necessarily immoral , " Pam Julyan responded . <p> The voters said character mattered more than the candidate 's stand on specific issues . <p> Part of the reason , some said , is that the news media have been riveted on character flaws of the two major candidates , ignoring the issues . But others argued that character was the single most important issue in the campaign . <p> " I always judge every politician by the issues , i.e. , what they say , " Mike Clower said . " And then I look at their character to see if I can believe what they say . And then if I determine from their character that I ca n't believe them , then the issues are irrelevant because everything they say is possibly a lie . " <p> Both North and Robb , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he needs more information about Coleman 's flip-flops before he can commit to Coleman . <p> Many in the group were troubled by the message that the election of either Robb or North would send to young people . " We are telling our kids and everybody else it 's okay to lie and do all these other things as long as he brings home the bacon , " said Steve Lingo , 33 , of Reston , an independent who works as a marketing analyst . <p> In addition to the candidates ' shortcomings , members of the group said they were concerned about the deterioration in the quality of their daily lives . A number said they felt far less safe in their neighborhoods than they did five years ago . The District 's violent crime rate and the perceived possibility of being a crime victim kept several out of the nation 's capital , they said . <p> Betty Ladd and Chuck Baker said they had altered the routine of their lives because of a fear of crime . Ladd said that she has cut back on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he now locks his car doors when driving to work . <p> " You have this fear in the back of your mind that it could happen to you now , " he said . <p> Pam Julyan said she and her husband have good friends in the District whose neighbor across the street was stabbed 35 times . " I wo n't go to Washington , D.C. , to go to a show , because I do n't want to drive down the streets , " she said . <p> Neither will Allen Childress nor Bill Conlon , they said . " It 's more mental , " said Conlon , 36 , an independent from Chantilly who teaches middle school . " Yes , you are afraid that something might happen . But , I mean , afraid for myself physically ? No , I am not . But I do n't want to go there and put myself in a position where something could happen . " <p> Some drew a connection between escalating crime and personal responsibility . <p> " That again gets into personal integrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents are raising their children , what the backgrounds are , the growth of single-parent families . It all seems to be intertwined . ... The politicians need to set an example , provide leadership , and I think that has been vastly lacking in the last couple of decades . " <p> Bell said he was intrigued by Coleman but was reluctant to " throw my vote away , " as he had for independent presidential candidates John Anderson in 1980 and H. Ross Perot in 1992 . <p> " Maybe he will send a message , but I have n't seen any change with a protest vote from Anderson and Perot and all these characters , " Bell said . <p> Pam Julyan said she had voted for Perot and did not want to waste her vote this time . After the two-hour discussion , she announced she had settled on voting for Robb . <p> No one else said how they would be voting on Nov. 8 . <p> Senior polling analyst Sharon Warden contributed to this report .
