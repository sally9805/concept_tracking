<p> When you check in at the hotel room of the near future , it will be like sleeping on air . <p> The hotel room of 2000 will have mattresses with inflatable pockets , so each guest can adjust the bed for firmness . <p> When you make reservations , a profile stored in a computer will let the hotel know that you like your bed as firm as a board with three hypoallergenic pillows in a no-smoking room with an armoire that unfolds into a workstation . <p> Desks will be bigger , lighting brighter . Wireless room phones will let you take calls by the pool or from across town . If you 're on the phone , even across town , the hotel voice-mail system will take messages . In-room fax machines will hold faxes in memory while you sleep in silence . <p> Hotels will even know when you 're about to arrive because you will be carrying a 5-cent radio frequency chip in your wallet . It 's embedded in your frequent-guest membership card . <p> Plan to steal something ? Similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeting cards - will be planted in furnishings to trigger the hotel alarm if you do . <p> Is this pie in the sky ? No , says a panel of executives from four hotel companies . They met recently in a brainstorming session with two vocal members of USA TODAY 's Road Warrior panel of frequent-business travelers . The two-hour session was so productive and provocative , says Hyatt Senior Vice President Jim Evans , that he left energized , and with eight pages of notes and ideas . <p> " I did n't hear anything that we ca n't put into tests , " says Steve Porter , Embassy Suites vice president of marketing . <p> Jack Whelan of Tewksbury , Mass. , one of the Road Warriors on the panel , says check-in must be faster and hassle-free . Hotels are studying ways to do that . Shuttle drivers could hand out keys on the way from the airport . Smart cards , already being used in some hotels for room keys , would make it possible to charge hotel food , gifts and use of the health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be obsolete in five years , predicts Technotrends co-author Daniel Burrus . They 'll be replaced by technology that will read your thumbprints or scan your retinas before letting you into a room . <p> The technology to implement all of this is either available now or will be soon . Of course , " people who own hotels do n't have bottomless pockets , " Evans says . Hotels are leery after scrambling to build exercise rooms . Surveys showed that 80% of business travelers wanted them , but only 10% used them . <p> But major changes are ahead , says Bill Watson , Best Western 's senior vice president . Watson predicts that the changes usually will be paid for a la carte : maybe $ 5 extra a night for a fax machine . <p> Some changes will take time because of cost . <p> Adjustable mattresses initially will be available only in rooms on the concierge floor . They cost about $ 1,000 , 10 times more than hotels spend for traditional mattresses . Business travelers also are insisting on two phone lines in each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take incoming calls at the same time . A second phone line costs hotels $ 500 to $ 600 a room , or at least $ 200,000 for a 400-room hotel . <p> But the timing could n't be better for making capital improvements . The industry is in its best financial shape in a decade . Occupancy is at a 10-year high , and rates are rising faster than inflation for the first time since 1987 . All those hotel rooms built in the 1980s are coming due for refurbishment , so hotels have already geared up for a big investment . And , with few new rooms being built , the industry will be almost immune to recession through 2004 , Coopers &; Lybrand says . <p> At the USA TODAY brainstorming session , two themes emerged as hotel executives and their best customers contemplated the hotel of the near future : <p>  --  Frequent travelers want to do as much as they can for themselves , just as they would if they were home . They use room service only because they have no choice late at night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a convenience store in the hotel lobby selling things at fair prices . Maybe travelers do n't use the exercise facility because it closes at 10 p.m . Give them aerobics on demand in their room by TV . <p> Good service is welcome but inconsistent , says Ellen Hollander , a frequent traveler and panel member from Silver Spring , Md . " The more self-sufficient you make the business traveler , the less you have to worry about attitudes at the front desk . " <p>  --  Rooms of the future increasingly will be customized for each guest . Some business travelers use the room to " work their tail off , " says Richard Driscoll , director of new business development for Steelcase , an office furniture maker that sees a new market in the revamping of hotels . Others work hard all day and want a room where they can " kick back . . . watch a good movie . . . lie on the bed and eat nachos . " Hotels that do n't bolt down the furniture are finding guests jury-rigging rooms to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But as hotels build computer profiles of their frequent guests , they 'll start to customize rooms for them . It will take just the push of a remote control and 30 to 60 seconds to adjust an air bed from hard to soft . Each side of the bed can be adjusted separately , and the hotel will provide suggested adjustments based on height and weight . Lighting also will be adjusted to be made dim for relaxation and bright for work . Hotels will have different kinds of furniture - maybe chaise longues for vacationers ; ergonomic desk chairs for business travelers - that will be moved from room to room and tracked with those 5-cent chips . Most furniture will be on rollers , so guests can make their own adjustments . <p> Hotels also must think about international guests . Some demand voice mail to keep hotel receptionists from botching messages arriving in foreign languages . Others do n't know what voice mail is and are offended that hotel employees do n't have the courtesy to write down messages . <p> Hotels must be ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about customers as they want us to know , " says Jim Burns , brand executive for Marriott Hotels . " We 'll even be able to customize the temperature in the room . " <p> Burns predicts rooms with no technology at all as places for people to " unplug " from phones , beepers and fax machines . But most will be technology-laden because the four-day workweek that was predicted in the ' 80s has turned into six . Today 's hotel rooms are still designed to replicate the bedroom . Those tiny desks have been around since turn-of-the-century travelers were writing postcards . Tomorrow 's hotel room will be more like an office . " Most business travelers no longer have a secretary back home , " says Don Landry , president of Choice Hotels . Voice mail is their receptionist , the hotel room their office . <p> Yet , surveys show that business travelers do n't want to sleep in something that looks like an office . So tomorrow 's hotel will be more like a den , Driscoll says . Some dens are used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for leisure , with a sound system and large-screen TV as a centerpiece . <p> Many improvements will be low tech . Staplers , paper clips and cellophane tape - free or in the minibar . Fewer drawers and more shelves and hooks . Desks on wheels that convert to tables for meals or games . Reversible bedspreads to make rooms look masculine or feminine . <p> In the rush toward the high tech , do n't forget the basics , Hollander warns . " They may say blow dryers are now standard . They 're not . Trust me . " <p> Most baby boomers remember when hotels were exciting because there were things there that were n't at home . Many watched color television and HBO for the first time in a hotel . <p> " Now you can get things in your home and office that far outstrip the hotel , " Driscoll says . " People are n't excited about going to hotels . But it 's a very exciting time . The hotel of the future will be extremely dynamic . " <p> " The room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ' 50s. " - Jim Evans , Hyatt executive <p> " The hotel of the future that will have a competitive edge is the one that does n't get caught up in technology . . . . Training will make the difference in the attitude of employees . " - Jack Whelan , Road Warrior <p> Guest checks in by inserting personal smart card into an automated check-in machine , or ACM .
