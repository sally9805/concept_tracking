// CAREFUL WHAT YOU SAY TO A woman dating Brad Pitt . * The cast of Friends has gathered in Matt LeBlanc 's dressing room between rehearsals , and Jennifer Aniston is asked what she thinks of " this marriage . " Her eyes grow wide . " What marriage ? she asks . The reporter says he 's not referring to her much-speculated-on real-life relationship , but to the show 's doozy of a season finale ( being shot today ) in which Aniston s Rachel and David Schwimmer s Ross appear to tie the knot in an impromptu Las Vegas wedding . * Aniston laughs , relieved , and her Friends laugh with her . * " Oh , " she says . " Well , I think it 's a great cliff-hanger . " She 's careful not to say too much more , even though the reporter says he wo n't reveal the details before the episode airs . " Did you sign something ? " demands LeBlanc . Ah , our Friends are wary of those bearing tape recorders and notepads . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stalked by photographers and jeered in print for their movies . They 've been called greedy for demanding $100,000 an episode in 1996 . The poor things ca n't get a haircut without the world weighing in on it . Well , then , on behalf of all media , we apologize . We apologize because we know that Mad About You 's Helen Hunt and Paul Reiser were making $1 million an episode-and in fact , we think that the Friends should ask for another raise . We apologize for making fun of the movies ( except maybe Ed , but only because it had a monkey in it ) , since we 've seen Lisa Kudrow in The Opposite of Sex and have been reminded what a remarkable reservoir of comic talent the series has wrought . But most of all , we apologize simply because we enjoyed this past season so damn much . A shining half hour in an otherwise dim season for comedy , Friends seemed re-reborn in-of all things-its fifth season , a time when most shows begin looking for cemetery plots ( or worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers made the show pop like a minefield of creativity : Boom ! Phoebe gives birth to triplets . Bang ! The secret affair between Monica and Chandler goes public . Kablooey ! Ross and Rachel stumble drunk from a Vegas wedding chapel . Friends is the best , and that 's official : With the passing of Seinfeld , NBC 's sitcom is now the nation 's top-rated . Most delightful to fans , critics , and cast members alike has been the rocky affair of Chandler and Monica , which allowed Matthew Perry and Courteney Cox to plumb new depths of their characters ' neuroses . And while Ross and Rachel 's surprise trip to the altar gave the season ender its oomph , the waffling of Chandler and Monica at the brink of the altar is a sure and encouraging sign that their affair will continue into the fall . Friends of Friends should know , however , that the relationship was almost very different . The show 's producers planted the seeds for the Ross  --  Rachel romance in the pilot , but had always planned for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark horse " romance ( as David Crane , one of the show 's creators , calls it ) originally involved not Monica and Chandler , but Monica and Joey ( LeBlanc ) . " This was before we cast the show , " says Crane , who had conceived of Monica as the group 's caretaker-a slightly cynical young woman whose good sense would prove combustible with Joey , originally designed as a heartless womanizer . But the producers quickly realized that a slightly wacky Monica was a much funnier Monica , and shortly into the first season Cox revealed a generous talent for playing obsessive cleanliness for laughs . Meanwhile , LeBlanc had some ideas for Joey . " I just did n't believe that the women would be friends with this guy who was so crass , self-centered , and hitting on them all the time , " he says . " In having respect for them , he could grow as a character . " Says Marta Kauffman , who created Friends with Crane : " I think the character we conceived was a little more two-dimensional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humor . " Ultimately , the producers decided Monica and Chandler would make the most strangely entertaining bedfellows . " We 've gone out of our way to make it feel different than Ross and Rachel , " says Crane . " We did n't do anything to lead up to it . We thought it could be one episode or three , but they have so many problems built into their characters that it 's yielded a ton of wonderful stories . " " For the first three years , I was just kinda saying the funny lines , " says Perry . " Now I can play some emotional stuff . " Cox , who chose the part of Monica instead of Rachel at the outset of the show regretted her decision for awhile . " But now I 'm in a relationship with Chandler , " she says , " and that 's really fun . " The Friends are smiling , which means that NBC and Warner Brothers can unfurrow their brows-just a bit . While the cast is contractually committed to a sixth season , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( given the show 's blockbuster performance in syndication-reruns of the first five seasons alone could generate $1 billion in revenue-the studio wants to keep the series going as long as possible ) , and the cast is n't expected to stay unless all of them agree to do so . " It 's our goal to have this all wrapped up by the time the sixth season starts , " says Kevin Bright , one of the hopeful executive producers . " I would do it if the entire cast did and the writing could stay at the same standard it has been , " says Schwimmer , perhaps the most serious-minded cast member and presumably the most likely holdout when it comes time to renew . ( " I do n't care how much money is thrown at me , " he says . " I need to be excited . " ) Yet even Schwimmer seems fairly happy these days : " There was a cynicism that crept into Ross over the last couple of years . Then this year led to a midlife crisis . He wigged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control , trying to grasp on to anything or anyone . I find that really endearing . " The question is , how long can a show about feckless twentysomethings remain endearing-or even believable-given that the average age of the characters is now hovering around 30 ? The producers are n't worried . " The characters are dealing with stuff that I think are grown-up issues , " says Crane , who 's been tossing around ideas for a " turning 30 " episode . " We had one we were working on where it was a series of flashbacks and flash-forwards , where we see all six of them turn 30 in the same show , " he says , " but the stories themselves were n't interesting enough . " In the meantime , says Kauffman , " the situations change , their lives change . They can get married , and they can have children . They can do all of that as long as the six of them remain together as a unit . " AND WHAT A UNIT-AN ENSEMble in the truest sense of the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast in TV history . Still , while the Friends seem to have endless disposable hours to hang out in Rachel and Monica 's apartment , the actors go their separate ways during their downtime . There are movies to make , offers to field , lovers to tend to , and in the case of Kudrow , a child to raise . Yet gathered here in LeBlanc 's dressing room , they seem like old , well , friends . " The bond that we all have , " says LeBlanc , " is this life-changing show . That keeps us together through it all . " The Friends nod in agreement . By " through it all , " he means the media backlash and spotlight , though Perry says that the glare has dimmed somewhat . " The cameras , the people taking pictures from my neighbors roof , " he says , " that 's calmed down . I do n't know if it 's because I 'm older or what , but it 's great .

You ca n't lie , you ca n't get out of it . " " Then you have your publicist sending over the Enquirer to your agents and everybody in your life , " says Cox , who denies reports of her eating disorders and insists that her fiance , Scream costar David Arquette , is now drug free . " You call and say , You do n't have to send everyone the Enquirer ! " ' " All you have to learn is how to maneuver yourself , which is not that hard , " says Aniston . The show 's cliff-hanger , though , could make maneuvering a bit more difficult ; it coincides with rumors that Aniston is pregnant ( Could a wedding with Ross be the producers ' answer to the dilemma ? ) . But Aniston 's publicist says the pregnancy rumors are " totally fabricated . " Aniston herself says that she and Pitt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speculation has been hilarious . " Speaking of speculation-and since the Friends seem to have warmed to the interview-the reporter pushes his luck : How much money will they ask for during negotiations ? An awkward silence follows until Perry , the group 's most reliable wisecracker , pipes up . " Finally ! " he jokes . " Our chance to say it ! " There is laughter and then another nervous hush falls over the dressing room . There are some secrets not even your best Friends will share .
