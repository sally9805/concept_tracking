Section : The long and extraordinary career of Sidney Hook . TABLE I. <p> In 1940 politics and philosophy came diabolically together . The world of action seemed to require the work of reflection to an unusual degree . It was the year of Dunkirk , and the fall of France ; and Hitler was deliberating his decision to give up the Battle of Britain and turn against the Soviet Union . In this year in which the destiny of the Western world hung on the clash between the ideologies of communism , fascism , and liberalism , two books appeared in the United States , Sidney Hook 's Reason , Social Myths , and Democracy and Herbert Marcuse 's Reason and Revolution . Hook dedicated his book To the Memory of a Great Adversary ' ( he was referring to Leon Trotsky ) . Marcuse dedicated his book To Max Horkheimer and the Institute for Social Research . ' The dedications marked respectively the death of the Old Left and the unanticipated birth of the New Left ( two decades later , to be sure , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually Marcuse 's influence would relegate Hook to the margins of American philosophy , not least because the New Left preferred to denounce Hook than to read him . <p> Long before Trotsky 's assassination that same year , several leading Old Left intellectuals had turned away from communism and its philosophical foundations in Marxism . A doctrine that had promised to predict events had scarcely explained them . The unexpected durability of the Third Reich , which was supposed to collapse upon Hitler 's advent to power ; the even more stunning non-aggression pact between Hitler 's Germany and Stalin 's Russia ; the nauseating helplessness with which writers watched the outbreak of the Second World War  --  all these events humbled the intellect , particularly the Marxian intellect , in its ambition to comprehend the meaning of history . <p> A reader of Reason and Revolution , however , could have looked upon these very events as evidence that history realizes itself through the dissolution and the destruction of its immediate forms . Mar-cuse 's reader could have seen , in grisly 1940 , Spirit ' struggling toward freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to interpret events , but to rescue Hegel from the Nazis . Still , the appearance of Hook 's collection of essays could not have been more timely . For Hook aimed to interrogate precisely what Marcuse sought to validate : the philosophy of the dialectic . <p> According to Marcuse , the most important aspect of Hegel 's philosophy is the principle of negation , ' the conviction that that which exists can not be true because Reason ' discovers a distinction between appearance and reality , and reveals the struggle of things to be what they are by overcoming what they were ; reality is permeated with contradictions between the actual and the potential , and the dialectic , which brings the potential out of the actual , inheres in the actual movement of things , and moves them along . It was precisely this way of thinking that Hook challenged . He exposed the imprecise metaphors and the indeterminate references latent in the dialectical language . The Marxists failed to see , according to Hook , that the concept of contradiction is a philosophical and linguistic construction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature , but in human judgments and statements . Under Hook 's withering logic , Engels 's ( and Marcuse 's ) vocabulary of negation ' in the service of freedom was shown to be rhetoric doing the work of reason . <p> One might have thought that Hook 's learned explorations of Marxism would have won some appreciation in America and more thoroughly influenced the intellectual scene . Not a chance . American liberals rarely interested themselves in Marxian ideas , and so they did not interest themselves in the rebuttal of those ideas . American radicals shunned Hook for much the same reason that Stalinists feared Trotsky : he was the man who knew too much . Future generations of intellectuals were so reluctant to acknowledge a formidable adversary that when The Dictionary of Marxist Thought was published in 1983 , edited by Tom Bottomore , a well-known sociologist and scholar of Marxism , Hook 's name did not appear in it . <p> American intellectual life will not be the same without Hook , who died two years ago at the age of 86 . He provoked more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and won more new admirers than any other member of the New York intellectuals . ' If two people agree , ' Hook once told a young scholar from the People 's Republic of China , one of them is not a philosopher . ' The disagreer may also become a polemicist , of course , and Hook was one of the most gifted polemicists of his age . The image of intellectual pugnacity stuck to him all his life , and probably went as far back as his Brooklyn school days , when his teachers , particularly the boring ones , regarded the small , bespectacled Jewish pupil as a troublemaker who asked too many questions . Hook seemed to have been born for disputation , and he could seldom resist the urge to annihilate his opponents , whose errors were usually not only wrong but demonstrably wrong . ' A raging rationalist , scrappy , aggressive , and witty , he was the Jake LaMotta of American philosophy , who went the rounds with the best of them ( Trotsky , Russell , Einstein ) and was never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circles , where many people remain ' 60s-struck , the mention of Sidney Hook 's name provokes more snarls than smiles . He is regarded as a renegade from radicalism , whose cold war anti-communism bore some of the responsibility for McCarthyism and the erosion of civil liberties , the Vietnam War , and the rise of neoconservatism . This view of Hook deserves a closer look , for it is sorely lacking in historical accuracy . <p> The McCarthyite right of the 1950s claimed that the American intellectual was too soft on communism ; the New Left of the 1960s charged Hook and his allies with being too hard on communism . The notion that Hook and the New York intellectuals were trying to outdo the right in its anti-Communist zeal ' ( in the words of Christopher Lasch ) is historically imprecise . For there was no significant anti-Communist right in America during and immediately after the Second World War , the period in which Hook and his generation , writing in Partisan Review , The New Leader , and politics , took a stand against Stalinism . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were trying to save the left from its pro-Communist zeal . <p> This was certainly the case in the Progressive campaign in 1948 , and at the Waldorf Conference in 1949 . The formation of the American Committee for Cultural Freedom , which Hook helped to organize ( he served as its first chairman ) , was a direct response not to Joe McCarthy , but to Soviet sympathizers such as Lillian Hellman and Paul Robeson , who had been participating in pro-Stalinist , anti-American cultural festivals in Europe . Hook 's own offensive against Stalinist Russia went as far back as the 1930s , when he organized the Trotsky countertrial ' in Mexico , only to discover that its verdict of innocence scarcely mattered in a world of power politics , in which truth was to be sacrificed for the duration of the Popular Front . When he was not allowed to speak at the Waldorf Conference , Hook demanded of the Soviet government precisely what the New Left would demand of the American government : freedom of information . <p> In 1953 Hook published a letter in The New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always felt that McCarthyism , like the various un-American activities committees , did more to obfuscate the Communist issue than to address it . But how , then , to address it ? In higher education , Hook sought to disentangle the question of anti-communism by confining the intellectual issue to the campus , where it would be addressed by the faculty on the basis of professional ethics . ' In Heresy , Yes  --  Conspiracy , No and Common Sense and the Fifth Amendment , Hook opposed loyalty oaths and upheld the right of Communists to teach , provided that the CP faculty member agreed to answer questions put forth by his or her academic peers . America thrives on open intellectual heresy , Hook insisted , but America must oppose covert political conspiracy . Hook was fond of quoting Woodrow Wilson : If there is nothing to conceal , why conceal it ? ' <p> During the Vietnam War , Hook became a symbol of everything that the New Left detested : the establishment ' intellectual who had organized the CIA-financed ACCF ; the cold warrior who opposed disarmament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Dead ' stance ; the ex-Communist who refused to see that Stalinism was only his generation 's hang-up and that the new revolutionary socialism in the Third World would show the gentler heart of Marxist humanism . ' Hook believed that America 's involvement in the war was mistaken ; but once involved , he said , it would be an even greater mistake to withdraw before North Vietnam recognized South Vietnam 's independence . This was , surely , a strange position for a pragmatist , for a teacher of a philosophy that proposes to test ideas in practice and prefers to admit the failure of an experiment ' than to stay a course regardless of the consequences . <p> The outcome of the Vietnam War proved both the right and the left wrong . Conservatives insisted that what was happening in Vietnam in the 1960s had a precedent in Eastern Europe in the 1940s : the absorption of independent nation-states by the Communist monolith . After the war , however , the dominoes ' did not fall , they fought each other ; the war was followed not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hook 's obsession with communism in the 1960s had more to do with the illusions of the left than the fears of the right . He could not countenance the New Left 's conviction that freedom , equality , and justice  --  what Tom Hayden called rice-roots democracy '  --  would spring to life from the Viet Cong 's struggle against imperialism . The illusions of revolutionary idealism outraged Hook , possibly because he remembered them from the early 1930s . <p> In his autobiography , Out of Step ( 1987 ) , Hook did grudgingly praise one aspect of the counterculture : its forthrightness about its political views and programs contrasted favorably with the mealy-mouthed ' behavior of those who took the Fifth . But Hook also asked for integrity and consistency , and with the radicalization of the campus he saw little of either . In Academic Freedom and Academic Anarchy ( 1970 ) , he protested the politicization of teaching and scholarship , the disruption of classes , and the harassment of professors , many of whom let Hook down by fearing to take unpopular positions against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he founded the University Center for Rational Alternatives , to organize faculty concerned about defending the academy against those whom he called the barbarians . ' His last political fight , carried right up until the end , involved a controversy at Stanford over the teaching of the classics of Western civilization ; race , sex , and class  --  some of the very distinctions that the Marxists had promised would disappear  --  were reappearing on the American campus , and they were being celebrated as instruments of intellectual liberation . <p> Still , Hook 's combativeness at the conservative Hoover Institution , and his collaboration with the neoconservatives , is not the whole story of his last years . In the company of the neocons , Hook continued to defend many causes of the left : progressive taxation , the rights of labor , the welfare state , freedom of choice in respect to abortion , and euthanasia as the final moral act , the ethics of suicide . ' And he continued to challenge many of the platitudes that still surround God , Capitalism , and Truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The polemicist and the activist represented only the irrepressible side of Hook 's mind and temperament . His love of rational argument reflected a deeper commitment to philosophy and the life of the mind . With the passing of the cold war , Hook 's anti-Communist arguments , the work for which he gained his notoriety , will no longer command attention , but his philosophical writings will remain central to American intellectual his-tory . They must not be buried beneath the magnificent weight of his disputations . <p> Hook 's first book , The Metaphysics of Pragmatism ( 1927 ) , was a doctoral dissertation written for John Dewey at Columbia University . Its misleading title was selected with malice prepense , ' Hook confessed , since metaphysics and pragmatism were generally regarded as mutually exclusive . In an introductory note , Dewey praised his young student for approaching philosophy historically , in order to appreciate ideas evolving from the world that is to be explored , as opposed to ideas that purport to represent or picture the world as it really , essentially , is  --  for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceed today . <p> Hook argued that a philosophy devoted to method need not be devoid of meaning in relation to existence . Defining metaphysics as an account of the generic traits of existence , ' Hook accounted for the mind pragmatically , as an organism responding to environmental conditions and circumstances . He rejected the legacy of Kantian idealism , a pre-evolutionary stance that holds the mind as its own object of knowledge that creates the world according to its own categories . For Hook , knowledge derives from the interaction of thought with the behavior of things ; it must have reference to events and can not be deduced independently of existence . <p> Hook challenged Kant 's conviction that metaphysical categories are prescribed by the mind . Conceiving thought as a tool , ' and man as homo faber ' working on the materials of existence , pragmatic philosophy became , in Hook 's formulation of it , a mode of inquiry in which thought and its sense impressions must be interpreted as checks and signs of what things are said or taken to be , ' verifiable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they intrinsically are . ' Metaphysically , the world is unknowable as some immutable essence . Pragmatically , it is knowable as the contingent stimuli that the mind encounters and ultimately aims to control . <p> It could be said that Hook redefined metaphysics  --  which traditionally denoted a realm beyond ' the scope of physics , or an aspiration to otherworldliness , or a participation in the universal and the eternal  --  to give pragmatism a modest metaphysical dimension without claiming more than science could deliver . Yet this learned defense of pragmatism fell short of satisfying those who were not already convinced of pragmatism 's validity ; and Hook 's defense of Dewey 's ethical theory , his insistence that scientific intelligence could be brought to bear so that the desired ' could , after critical reflection on the consequences of anticipated action , be translated into the desirable , ' and educated citizens could know what ought ' to be done , drew a pointed retort from Morton White , who observed that descriptive statements can not be transformed into normative judgments without the intervention of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hook 's book appeared the same year as Martin Heidegger 's Being and Time . The comparison is telling about the two philosophical cultures . The German philosopher had also taken what might be called the pragmatic turn . ' He , too , described thought as inseparably bound to things and tools , and sought to relocate philosophy in purposive action , in which objects are commonly known when they are put to use . Heidegger , however , was eventually horrified by a world coming to be governed by technology and its manipulations . He turned to an occult and lyrical exploration of Being . ' Hook , by contrast , had no patience for such leaps past reason , and he saw technology as an instrument that denotes purpose as well as power . <p> During the 1930s and early 1940s , Hook had been absorbed in radical politics , and in writing on Marxism . Not until the 1950s did he return to pure ' philosophy and address again the subject of metaphysics . The postwar years had witnessed the revival of metaphysics in Thomistic Catholicism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophical currents were false , and that they had conservative political tendencies , Hook wrote The Quest for Being ( 1953 ) , in which he took on all who promised a deliverance from history and materialism , and challenged the cognitive legitimacy of metaphysics and ontology . ' <p> The problem with metaphysics , according to Hook , is that it shuns the practical for the ineffable , and misleads philosophers into assuming that they can say something profound about the obscure and the opaque . Quine and Tillich were two of Hook 's disparate villains , for their view that abstract concepts can tell us something about the ontological status of reality . Hook was determined to rehabilitate empiricism . For Hook , the categories with which one thinks and organizes experience themselves undergo change , and therefore they can not reflect the nature of things . Pragmatic knowledge aims not to grasp things , but to experiment with them , and in the process perhaps to transform them . To know is to do . <p> Heidegger 's ontological quest left Hook wondering why an eminent philosopher would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' seemed , for Hook , to turn philosophy into a search for a phantom Absolute . Hook had no quarrel with Heidegger 's notion that the metaphysical questioner is implicated in his question and thus can never know the world independently of its relation to himself . But Heidegger 's conviction that the philosopher , unable to stand apart from Being to study it , can hope to understand it by participating in it , looked like transcendental nonsense . The concept of Being , Hook exploded , has no intelligible opposite ' other than non-being , ' and non-being can not be regarded as coeval with existence . <p> His conclusion that Heidegger 's formulation of ontological issues was devoid of sense except as a sign of emotional anxiety ' tells much about Hook 's philosophical temper . Hook wished to measure Heidegger by the standards of scientific thought and the rules of logic . He had no natural sympathy with anguish , with guilt about death , with the abyss , with nothingness . All his life he retained an unwavering confidence in science , pragmatism , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made of the recent revival of pragmatism in American philosophy , owed largely to Richard Rorty , who has claimed that Dewey and Heidegger were traveling the same philosophical road away from truth and certainty and toward language and contingency . ) The danger to modern man was not metaphysical dread , but visionary ideas and vain actions . Earlier in his career , Hook even tried to convince his fellow Americans that communism , too , could be supported as a pragmatic proposition . <p> IV . <p> The rebellion against the dialectic that Hook fostered in the 1940s and 1950s was the result of a brilliant schooling in the Marxist tradition in the 1930s . And the anti-Communist activism for which Hook became famous was the fruit of a strict intellectual encounter with the Marxist tradition , an encounter in which Hook 's politics and philosophy were curiously brought together . <p> Marxism is not a dogmatic system ' but a scientific critique , ' Hook wrote to Dewey from Berlin in 1929 . He was studying Marxism as a Guggenheim scholar in Germany and at the Marx-Engels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korsch and translated his writings into English , and he read the work of Georg Lukacs . Hook , Korsch , and Lukacs were engaged , in fact , in a similar project , in the same project that gave Gramsci work in his prison cell : how to free the voluntaristic elements in Marxism from a mechanical and deterministic theory of history . <p> The context of Hook 's first writings on Marxism was crucial , politically and philosophically . The CPUSA had yet to claim a major American intellectual . Having expelled Will Herberg , Jay Love-stone , and Bertram Wolfe in 1929 , the Party lost some of the best Marxist theoreticians in the country . Although Earl Browder was unhappy with Hook 's reinterpretation ' of Marxism , and Communists would soon attack him as a revisionist , ' the Party tried to recruit Hook , as a means of getting to Dewey and , to Hook 's dismay , to do organizational and propaganda work for Russia . ( The Party was also interested in having Hook set up a spy apparatus , ' a proposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ) A year before his meeting with Browder , Hook signed Culture and Crisis , ' a document in which leading American intellectuals endorsed the 1932 Communist presidential ticket . Still , Hook would have nothing to do with the Party ; and thus America remained a country with a Communist Party but without a leading Communist philosopher . <p> The theoretical context is also important . Since the Second International ( 1889-1914 ) , Marxism had been regarded as an empirical science , in which the laws of history unfolded according to predetermined stages . The practical consequence of that doctrine was that the transition to socialism must await economic development . That fatalistic view prevailed until the October Revolution , when Lenin broke the spell of theory by seizing power . Thinkers such as Lukacs , Gramsci , and the American Max Eastman subsequently credited Lenin with showing the way to freedom , will , and consciousness . Hook , by contrast , had interpreted Marxism itself as no less a philosophy of freedom than a philosophy of determinism . For Hook , Marxism was a theory according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once science is conceived not as the unfolding of laws or as the inexorable realization of ideals , but as the practical application of intelligence for the purpose of social change . <p> In Toward the Understanding of Karl Marx ( 1933 ) and From Hegel to Marx ( 1936 ) , Hook argued that the famous paradoxes ' of Marx 's thought  --  between theoretical analysis and revolutionary activism , between scientific objectivity and class teleology  --  were the result of confrontations with the thought of opponents whose positions are antithetical to each other . ' Hook 's Marx was a fox , not a hedgehog , a philosopher who adapted his theory to changing conditions and judged any course of action in the light of its consequences . And a fox is a pragmatist . Hook drew parallels between Marxism and pragmatism , which were corroborated , he believed , by Marx 's eleventh thesis on Feuerbach , the one about philosophers having not to interpret the world but to change it . Did not Dewey and Marx share a common commitment to praxis , to the idea that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in practice ? <p> Many radicals of the Depression years embraced communism for its promise to rid society of the curse of property , but Hook seems to have turned to Marxism for its promise to rid philosophy of the curse of epistemology . With Marxism , as with pragmatism , philosophy no longer depended on the correspondence ' theory of truth that requires ideas to represent accurately the real world . Hook insisted that Marxism rested on naturalism rather than metaphysics , on the stream of experience rather than the abstractions of reason . Even the dialectical content of Marxism did not mean that capitalism was fated to collapse by the weight of its contradictions ; it demonstrated , instead , that knowledge arises out of experimental encounters with reality and is verified empirically . As a plan of action , ' Marxism is a scientific instrument , not a doctrinaire ideology . The union of his two intellectual allegiances must have been satisfying to the young thinker . <p> Surely Hook exaggerated the activist ethos of Marxism , preferring for philosophical reasons to overlook its assumptions about the nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to understand the world is to act upon it and thereby to alter it . Marx himself could hardly have subscribed to a pragmatic criterion of verification , however , and at the same time claimed to have learned from history . If knowledge can be neither introspectively discoverable nor retrospectively recoverable , if it can not be accurately represented by the correspondence of words to things , if knowledge must await scientific verification , how could Marx have written so confidently about the past , or dared to establish historical laws that would predict the future ? <p> When Hook published his first work on Marxism , he was a revolutionary Communist who questioned neither Stalin 's silencing of all opposition nor Lenin 's principle of the dictatorship of the proletariat . His readers were taught why all forms of government must be abolished ( Wherever we find a state , there we find a dictatorship ' ' ) , and why dissent and opposition could not be tolerated ( The first task the proletarian dictatorship much accomplish is to crush all actual or incipient counterrevolutionary movements ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few years . In 1935 , in a debate with Will Herberg , Hook challenged the principle of party dictatorship and the assumption ( which would be developed by E. H. Carr ) that the victory of the Bolsheviks over all other factions proved their superior grasp of the direction of history and endorsed their claim that only they could represent the interest of the workers . <p> But what , then , remained of Marxism as a philosophical proposition ? That question led to one of the liveliest and wittiest debates in the annals of the American left . Hook and Eastman had been going at it since 1928 , when Hook wrote a scathing review of Eastman 's Marx and Lenin : The Science of Revolution ( 1926 ) . Earlier , in his journal Liberator , Eastman had depicted Lenin as a scientific genius ' and the engineer ' of the October Revolution , as the brilliant Bolshevik who , in seizing power , rescued Marxism from the complacent illusions of German idealism . ( Gramsci was thrilled by Eastman 's writings and ran them in L'Ordine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a sharp distinction between Marx the philosophical determinist and Lenin the revolutionary activist , Hook was furious , and accused Eastman of reading too much Hegelianism into Marxism . When Hook 's books on Marxism appeared in the early 1930s , Eastman was waiting to settle the score . <p> In some respects , Eastman 's criticism of Hook curiously resembles Hook 's later criticism of Heidegger , except that in Hook 's case the occult entity under attack was not Being ' but the Dialectic . ' The notion that the dialectic offered ( in Hook 's words ) the philosophical rhythms of conscious life ' seemed to Eastman a species of animism , ' the primitive fallacy of reading into the objective world the unfolding of human desires and purposes . The dialectic had no more empirical warrant , said Eastman , than the Father , the Son , and the Holy Ghost . In a pamphlet called The Last Stand of Dialectical Materialism , ' Eastman asked why Hook had to characterize Marx 's philosophy <p> as naturalistic activism , ' social be-haviorism , ' revolutionary voluntarism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical historicism , ' realistic evolutionary naturalism , ' Aristotelianism saturated with temporalism , ' and other long-tailed horny epithets very disheartening to a man who is not accustomed to take his vacations in the library . <p> Hook 's son has recently remarked that his father treasured these debates with Eastman , which lasted a decade . The Debate of the Colossi , ' as Max Schachtman dubbed it , led to a doctrinal crisis ' on the left . The controversy reached absurd heights when Trotsky stepped in to explain to Eastman , Hook , and James Burnham how even animals can think dialectically . ( Clearly , the legs of a fox are equipped with Hegelian tendencies . . ' ' ) Hook continued to insist that Marx had successfully dispelled Hegelian metaphysics , that Marxism could be appreciated as science . Without ever acknowledging that Eastman had been right about the mystifying magic of the dialectic , Hook went to work on the concept and left it in shambles . In the short-lived Marxist Quarterly , Hook addressed the subject of Dialectic and Nature ' and exposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all the Hegelian categories that Engels read into the logical ' processes of nature itself  --  the law of contradiction , the transformation of quantity into quality , the negation of the negation , and so on  --  were pure mythology . ' <p> In 1943 Hook 's The Hero in History offered his final scrutiny of all that remained obscurantist in Marxist theory . This time the object of his withering logic was not only dialectical materialism , but also the notion of historical inevitability , which was virtually a Marxist mystique . Hook drew a distinction between the event-making man , ' whose actions derive from exceptional capacities of intelligence , will , and character rather than contingencies of circumstance , and the eventful man , ' whose actions were decisive in influencing historical development in dramatically different directions than it would otherwise have taken . By combining both , Lenin 's role in the Bolshevik Revolution refutes the historical determinism of the orthodox Marxists , those Second International theorists who adduced the logic ' of history instead of human will . ( Later , in Marx and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Revolution , and drew a distinction between the totalitarian consequences of Lenin and the democratic values of Marx and his commitment to the workers . ) <p> Unlike many ex-radicals of the 1930s , Hook never exactly repudiated Marxism . He continued to believe in the enduring relevance of Marx 's sense of property as a fundamental category of social relations . He continued to approve of Marx 's historical and biological materialism that , like pragmatic naturalism , extirpated dualism and properly made the mind seem continuous with nature . And most important , he continued to value Marx 's humanism , ' as it was reflected in his distrust of overspecialization and excessive division of labor , his concern with human alienation and his view that it can be overcome by creative fulfillments through uncoerced work . ' When Ronald Reagan bestowed the Presidential Medal of Freedom on Sidney Hook , he pinned it on a Marxist . ( Memories of Menshevism still linger in the orange groves at the Hoover Institution . ) <p> Hook remained , of course , a pragmatist . He always refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , when thinkers on the left and the right assumed that the fate of freedom depended upon the mode of production , collectivist or capitalist , when both the Bolshevik and the businessman ( as Hook observed in The New Leader ) claimed that political freedom is a byproduct , or superstructural addition to , ' society 's economic foundation , Hook demurred . He had no patience with the causal monism ' that reduced history to predetermined alternatives . Thus , when Eastman drew on F. A. Hayek to insist that a planned economy had ushered in Communist and fascist dictatorships , Hook pointed out that Bolsheviks , blackshirts , and brownshirts first seized political power and then installed collectivist and corporatist systems . Italy and Germany , he argued , fell not to creeping socialism , ' but to anti-democratic party movements ; and in Russia socialism died before the Bolsheviks allowed it to be born . Hook never saw an incompatibility between democracy and socialism . <p> V. <p> In the battle over religion that raged during the war years , new scholastics struck the first blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was conquered by the Wehrmacht in 1940 , a conference of philosophers and scientists in New York heard Mortimer J. Adler deliver an address on God and the Professors . ' Adler charged that positivists and pragmatists represented a more serious threat to democracy than Hitler , whose nihilism ' was at least more honest and consistent , less blurred by subtleties and queasy qualifications . ' Adler claimed that metaphysics was vital in defeating fascism . The unwillingness of many American intellectuals to take up arms against Hitler ( Our Guilt in Fascism , ' as Waldo Frank called it in THE NEW REPUBLIC ) was attributed to a modernist ' outlook that rejected the absolute nature of values that were accessible to philosophical intuition independently of scientific discovery . <p> Of course , the claims for metaphysics made by Adler and his idol , the Aristotelian Robert Maynard Hutchins , never really passed the test proposed by its own advocates . Ontological thought hardly saved Heidegger from Hitler ; nor did Aristotle and Aquinas help the isolationist Hutchins grasp the necessity of America 's entry into the war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fate of the Jews reached America , Catholic thinkers were still blaming the ravages of war and dictatorship on professors and intellectuals , and remained steadfastly silent about the Vatican 's conduct during what later became known as the Holocaust . <p> Hook responded to Adler with an article in THE NEW REPUBLIC on The New Medievalism , ' and when Protestant theologians joined Catholics in attacking secular intellectuals , he asked Dewey to join him in a symposium on The New Failure of Nerve ' in Partisan Review . Hook and Dewey pointed out that fascism and communism had little to do with intelligence and the methods of science , and a great deal to do with emotion and the madness of dogma . While the more patient Dewey tried to explain the principles of scientific naturalism , Hook took off after theologians and other defenders of religion with a fury driven by feeling and by logic . <p> In those articles , and in the essays gathered in The Quest for Being , Hook surveyed the theological currents of the day as a skeptical God-seeker ' willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down every last semblance of evidence or argument ' that would illuminate the case for a Supreme Being . Hook doubted logic 's capacity to prove the necessary ' existence of God conceived as either transcendent or immanent . When one interlocutor advised Hook that it matters not that religious doctrine is true , but that it is believed for the sake of social order , Hook invoked the Grand Inquisitor and his condescending defense of organized irrationalism in behalf of human freedom , ' which amounted , in Hook 's view , to an intellectual absurdity . ' Hook remained loyal to Feuerbach in his conviction that attributions to God are projections of human needs in a world threatened by impersonal things , that religion is an expression of longing or an objectification of experience . Hook suggested that religion belonged to philosophical anthropology . ' <p> He departed from his master Dewey , moreover , in rejecting the idea that the use of the term God ' is legitimate for secular humanism 's moral purposes . In politics , as well as in ethics , the idea that democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pragmatism . Hook denied that the theological dogmas of Hebraic Christianity ' are the historical sources of modern democracy . He wrote firmly in the spirit of The Federalist , in which the Framers ' suspicions of all religious claims to doctrinal authority rendered them distrustful of factions driven by zeal , ' which they likened to oppressive Protestant sects . ' ( Hook did respect Reinhold Niebuhr , though , who spoke for the impossibility of knowing truth and the obligation to seek it . ) <p> Hook 's treatment of religion and metaphysics drew criticism not only from theists , but also from American philosophers who refused to identify the life of the mind solely with the life of scientific inquiry . Richard Bernstein reminded Hook that Heidegger and the existentialists based their claims , like the pragmatists , on appeals to experience , ' and Henry David Aiken suggested that the despair of man in our time ' derives not from his ignorance ' but from his wickedness , his inhumanity , and his passion for self-destruction , ' all of which a Deweyan faith in education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pragmatism and the Tragic Sense of Life ( 1973 ) , Hook answered his critics on their own grounds . <p> In those years , in the 1950s and 1960s , existentialism , phenomenology , theology , and Freudianism seemed to leave pragmatism behind . Dewey 's doctrines looked like an arid , scientistic mode of inquiry that avoided questions of meaning and value . The pragmatic rationalist , Hook reported , is pictured as a man without feeling , taste , emotion , or even a genuine desire for human happiness . ' Reason came to be identified with instrumental rationality , and the mind as a kind of impersonal organ or instrument content to measure and control . How could pragmatism be a noble philosophy if it failed to address ultimate questions ? <p> Hook had an answer , naturally . Pragmatism 's nobility , he wrote , lies in its recognition that genuine moral decisions have a tragic dimension in situations where good conflicts with good . ' Pragmatism offers no promise about rightful outcomes , no certainty that some good may not be sacrificed in pursuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral ambiguity regardless of its intention . Many have been the attempts to escape the antinomies between the right and the good by defining the good as the object of right or the right merely as the means to the good . All have failed . ' The pragmatist can scarcely endorse the Kantian view that some duties are imperatives that must always ' be carried out . All important decisions , Hook explained to pragmatism 's critics , depend on circumstances , and probably on consequences ; and thus the rationalist can not escape the agony of choice . <p> Hook 's sensitivity toward the antinomies of value  --  he was not quite the doctrinaire scold that he sometimes seemed to be  --  was applied to political philosophy in The Paradoxes of Freedom ( 1970 ) , an exploration of the dilemmas of a democratic culture in which rights are regarded as absolute . Addressing Justice Black 's conviction that the Bill of Rights can not be abridged , Hook explained that the claims of some rights can entail the infringement of others . ( The right of freedom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a fair trial . ) Hook saw no possibility of establishing a philosophical ultimate on which to base such decisions , and insisted that public issues must be left to the democratic process rather than the courts . Hook believed in participatory democracy ' as fervently as did the authors of the Port Huron statement ; but he believed in democracy as a regulative ' rather than a realizable ideal , as a method rather than an absolute . <p> Hook 's horror of absolutes was vividly illustrated in 1989 , a few months before his death , in his thoughts on Allan Bloom . Hook admired Bloom for denouncing the influence of the New Left assaults on the campus , but the matter did not end there . Bloom traced the whole problem to the belief that truth is relative , ' and one can imagine Hook 's juices boiling at that : The Closing of the American Mind gave Hook a final occasion to vindicate the legacy of Dewey . Bloom 's whole discussion of the theme from the first page to the last is vitiated by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with moral relativity . ' Hook instructed Bloom on the meaning of relationism ' or objective relativism , ' that ideas and propositions are not subjective or arbitrary , but dependent upon historical circumstances for their possible fulfillment . Hook insisted that such a dependence was a strength , not a weakness , and cited the pragmatic genius ' of Lincoln . Bloom assumes , ' he wrote , that there exists one underlying good that can be grasped if we understand the nature of man , ' and from which all moral judgments of good or bad can be ultimately derived in all situations . . Not only is this position false , but demonstrably false . . The difficulty with Bloom 's position is that , like Leo Strauss , he has not emancipated himself from the Greek notion that the cosmos is also an ethos , and that what is good and bad , right and wrong for man is essentially related to the cosmic order rather than to the reflective choices of men and women confronted by problems of what to do . <p> Between the pragmatists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : We are separated by an abyss . ' <p> The abyss , however , was not Sidney Hook 's natural habitat . Sartre 's pronouncement that if we must die then our life has no meaning ' seemed meaningless to him , another failure of nerve , another refusal to accept mortality with dignity . Agony over death , ' he observed , strikes me as one of the unloveliest features of the intellectual life of our philosophic times  --  and certainly unworthy of any philosophy which conceives of itself as a quest for wisdom . It has never been clear to me why those who are nauseated by life , not by this or that kind of life but any kind of life , should be so fearful of death . <p> The philosopher Hook never feared death . And he was so much the philosopher that death was his last subject . Among his papers were found writings on the right to die and the uses of death that he had written as a graduate student in the early 1920s . In Convictions , a posthumously published collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death , hospitalized with congestive heart failure , drowning in a sea of slime , ' and unsuccessfully requesting the doctors to pull the life support plugs . I had paid my dues to death , ' he wrote . The sight of hundreds of persons living on mattress graves in the home of the disabled and incurable in which my father took twenty-five years to die had made me a fervent believer in voluntary euthanasia . ' And then Hook proceeded to do philosophy in a hospital bed , to argue about the problem of Job and the unacceptability of human affliction , to expound on the concepts of good and evil that are supposed to explain it . His own death was near , but the old atheist was enjoying a final round with God . <p> By John Patrick Diggins <p> <p> John Patrick Diggins is Distinguished Professor of History at the Graduate School , CUNY , and author of two forthcoming books , The Rise and Fall of the American Left ( W.
