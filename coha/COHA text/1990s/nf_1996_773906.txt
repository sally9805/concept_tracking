Fred Bruns recalled installing a Jacobs machine in Canada at a wilderness mink farm . To get clear of the surrounding forest , he topped four trees at sixty feet , built a platform , and erected a sixty-foot Jacobs tower on the platform . The tree-stump foundation bore the tower well and the machine provided power for many years ? $ The fifty thousand figure does not take into account smaller wind units . Radio companies ( e.g. , Zenith ) sold small , wind-driven units to charge a six-volt battery . The Sears Roebuck catalog marketed a Silvertone Aircharger in 1946 for $32.50 , with batteries from $2.69 and up 79 The husband-and-wife owners of a store in Fluvanna , Texas , recalled that " we were really uptown ' when we got windchargers : " They only sold a few of the larger models , but hundreds of the $15 and $18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge a Band C dry battery and a 6-volt storage battery for the family radio$ ? R. E. Weinig , the general manager of Wincharger Corporation , testified in 1945 that some 400,000 Wincharger plants operated worldwide , of which only about 25,000 were large plants . " Wincharger Corporation produced most of these small units . Other brands included the Miller Airlite , Universal AeroElectric , Paris-Dunn , Airline , Wind King , and Winpower.82 The fifty thousand figure also does not take into account those inventive fanners and ranchers who , like the youthful Jacobs brothers , built their own wind-energy plants . Ranchers have always been dexterous and they rarely discard old cars and trucks ? a handy source of parts to fashion a wind plant . One west Texas rancher recalled how he combined a propeller , a 6-volt battery , and an automobile headlight to make his wind plant . Another recalled that his family " had good lights " from a little 6-volt system they put together.83 When the Nor ' - West Farmer , a Canadian journal , in 1937 offered to provide readers with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) wind plant , correspondents swamped the editors with requests . Sending out the instruction sheets , one employee remarked that if everyone who requested the information built a plant , " they would soon use up all the wind . " 84 In recent years , wind-energy devotees have purchased and rebuilt many old Jacobs 110-volt generators . They are considered to be the finest wind plants ever manufactured anywhere in the world . In 1989 , Home Power magazine continued to recommend restored Jacobs , saying these old turbines have " proven reliable and will remain popular until the demand for new wind generators decreases their price " 85 ? a tribute to the work of the two Montana youths who , with little formal training , made it happen . Although no machine directly competed with the Jacobs , the Wincharger Corporation , of Sioux City , Iowa , delivered thousands of wind units to U.S. farmers and ranchers . The corporation began production in 1935 , gaining popularity because their units were of comparatively moderate price . Ranchers called Winchargers the Chevrolet or Model T of wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly because of the range of models available , from 6-volt to 110-volts and from 200W to 3,0O0W.86 Often , a rancher hesitating while anticipating central power , and unable to afford a Jacobs , purchased a Wincharger . Most Wincharger models used a four-bladed wheel that operated at a satisfactory number of revolutions per minute . The governor , or brake , however , posed a problem . Unlike the Jacobs , the Wincharger had fixed blades , so although the brake slowed down the propeller , the pressure remained . In a gale , the pressure often became so great that the apparatus was wrecked by being blown against the tower . Bruns , who installed a number of Winchargers , said " they worked after a fashion , " but " often blew down . " 87 Later models , somewhat remedied this flaw , utillizing a variable-pitch governor that in high winds could feather two of the four blades 88 // The Wincharger did not gain the reputation of the Jacobs , but it had many satisfied customers . For example , Ida Chambers and her son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranch with electricity between 1946 and 1954 with a Wincharger 32-volt system . In an interview , Ida Chambers fondly recalled that the machine required no repairs and that it was a " very , very good investment . . . the greatest thing that ever was . " 89 Her daughterin-law , Becky Chambers , remembered differently . When Ida hooked up to REA power , Becky recalled , she " gathered all her 32-volt appliances , marched out to the yard , dug a hole , and threw them in ? glad to be rid of them . " 90 However , the Chambers would have continued to use their machine but for the desire for television and the like ( unavailable on a 32-volt system ) . Although the Chambers family moved and the ranch is now part of Grand Teton National Park , the Wincharger remains , a little the worse for wear but still atop its tower ? and Jackson Hole , although not subject to the severe winds of the Great Plains , is not known for mild weather . The Jacobs Wind Electric Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Wincharger ceased production of all but a tiny , 200-watt miniature machine . Marcellus Jacobs said he just quit trying to fight the tough combination of AC power and the REA 91 In truth , when Jacobs first perfected his wind machines , and when the first Wincharger came off the assembly line , even greater forces were at work to limit the potential of wind energy and eventually destroy the market : centralized systems , with all their ramifications . Marcellus Jacobs recognized the trend and in an attempt to adapt he proposed to the U.S. Congress in the mid1950s that his company provide " high line grid system booster A.C. wind electric plants . " The Jacobs Wind Electric Company would build and install , on grid towers , one thousand wind generators , one mile apart , on the power-line system from Great Falls , Montana , to Minneapolis , Minnesota . The wind-generated energy would feed // into the grid . Neither Congress nor power-transmission executives responded favorably to the idea 92 In the grandiose plans of the power companies , there was no niche for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the first nemesis of a neophyte industry struggling to perfect its technology and raise capital . Private power , however , left plenty of possibilities for wind-energy use on ranches and remote farms . The Rural Electrification Administration closed this remaining window of opportunity , as we shall see in the next chapter . // THE REA OFFERS A DIFFERENT WAY It is natural that the owners would not want to junk their independent plants and join the high-line immediately . This is particularly true of the wind-driven plants which have low operating costs . - RURAL ELECTRIFICATION SURVEY , KANSAS STATE COLLEGE , 1940 NO ONE WOULD DENY THE SUCCESS OF THE RURAL ELECTRIFICATION Administration ( REA ) in performing its task . But neither would anyone dispute that the REA sounded the death knell for small windenergy systems . As already noted , Marcellus Jacobs , for one , simply became weary of fighting the REA . However , the REA was only the final blow in the battle over providing power in both the city and country . This struggle eliminated the market for individual systems of power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whereby companies that produce heat or steam generate electricity for commercial use . The wind-electric companies were hit hard by centralization and by government subsidies for central systems . No wind-electric company survived . Thomas Edison took the first step in centralization in 1882 when he built New York 's Pearl Street generating station . From that time on , U.S. capital and inventiveness strove to create huge , centralized systems , in communications , highways , and power . According to one historian of technology , the genius of U.S. invention in the late106 EARLY HISTORY nineteenth century and the twentieth century was not in the introduction of specific inventions such as the telephone , electric lighting , and the automobile , but rather in the development of systems to utilize such inventions . ' In retrospect , if Charles Brush had designed a synchronous converter to feed his wind-dynamo energy into a central grid system , he would have made a more significant contribution to American invention . Where Brush failed , Samuel Insull succeeded . If the windenergy companies had a nemesis , recognized or not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at amalgamating electrical systems . In time , his Middle West Utility Company owned or controlled a vast utility empire from one end of the nation to the other , representing assets of over $1.2 billion . At the height of his power , in the 1920s , Insull opposed any decentralized systems or individual plants . Constantly , he declared his faith in private ownership of power production and distribution . He championed what historian Harold Platt has called " the gospel of consumption " 2 In Insull 's scheme of thing , gasoline and wind-electric plants in rural areas were no more than tiny gnats , but they deserved to be swatted . For utility companies committed to complex electrical grids , any independent , small-scale power plant represented an annoying anomaly : Disorder within an orderly system ? a problem , not a solution . ' Samuel Insull 's initial interest in rural electrification can be dated to 1906 , the year he purchased Hawthorne Farm , a country estate north of Chicago . On weekends , Insull motored to his rural retreat to enjoy the pastoral life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comforts that the city ? and electricity ? afforded . Within a couple of years , Insull had upgraded his personal electrical service , and , in the process , that of the county . He enthusiastically embarked on what became known as the Lake County experiment ? an effort to " electrify " the countryside . // This first rural electrification project proved successful , both in terms of profit for the utility company and service to the rural consumers . Other utility companies followed suit , running lines to villages and rural residents . By 1920 , according to Insull 's bi-ographer , the systematization movement had gained such momentum that ? along with the new automobile industry ? it would dominate , and then carry , the American economy for better than a decade . By the time it was over , electric power would be so abundant and cheap in the United States that people who had never expected to use it found it as natural and as necessary as breathing.4 Such an appraisal of Insull 's role in rural electrification might lead one to believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in utility companies busily initiated programs , running countless lines to the hinterlands of America . This was not the case . Insull was sympathetic to rural electrification , but he had not risen to power through good works and philanthropy . Shrewd business practice called for caution and Insull would not construct a rural electric system unless he believed it would be profitable . However , shrewd business practice also called for sympathetic interest . The National Electric Light Association 's Committee on Electricity in Rural Districts ( primarily a Insull-inspired construct ) provided the vehicle for both sympathy and caution . After studying the situation , the committee 's 1913 report noted the need for rural electrification , but also suggested that apathy among farmers hindered progress . The report implied that delays and inaction resulted from the paradoxical attitude of the rural community . While many embraced progress , others were indifferent ; farmers lacked agreement . In a situation of client indifference , inaction and delay seemed to be the most prudent course . The low level of interest extended to federal government officials , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James Wilson , seeking // federal assistance for rural electrification , " they were greeted with an enthusiastic yawn. " 5 THE GRID GETS GOING Following World War I , the utility industry enjoyed a decade of tremendous expansion and achievement , " the greatest the power companies have ever known . " 6 Cities and towns across the country installed central electrical systems and industry provided a stream of new appliances to consume the product . As part of this growth , the utility companies , the federal government , and farm organizations shook off their lethargy , recognizing the social and economic importance of electricity on farms and ranches . However , the National Electric Light Association ( NELA ) made little progress in satisfying the demand for energy . In 1924 , the Committee on Electricity in Rural Districts reported that " the development of rural electric service from central stations has just started . " 7 The committee professed an interest in rural electrification , and Insull and other leaders spoke and wrote of the need and their efforts to fill that need . But it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the utility companies could prosper in the city ? And so the utility companies created an illusion of interest in solving the farm problem . Statistical evidence reveals that there was only sluggish progress . In twenty-seven states , only 300,000 farms and ranches were hooked up to central power.8 Nationally , statistics reveal that of approximately 6,371,000 farms throughout the nation , only 500,000 were part of centralized electric power ? In the 1930s , Rural Electrification Administration bureaucrats usually gave a 10 percent figure when quantifying the sad state of electrical service in rural America 10 Accounting for such an abysmal record , Insull and others blamed the cost of stringing power lines . The cost in rural regions ranged from $800 to $2,400 a mile , depending on labor rates , terrain , soil , // and other factors ? figures the companies often found to be prohibitive . The Wisconsin Power and Light Company , figured $1,405.12 per mile as their average . Using such a figure , service for a farm valued at , say , $8,000 and located six miles from a line would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no ready solution for this problem . He certainly did not want government involvement , but neither did he suggest that individual electric-power plants might be the answer in isolated regions . He talked of cooperation and community , using an urban example : " Our manufacturing industries have been enabled either to junk their old power plants or to construct factories without installing equipment for generating power . " Rural America could do the same . " This will happen in similar fashion on the farm from the pooling of the power supply of a great number of consumers thus the farmer 's capital costs for power are reduced ? ' The answer , Insull believed , lay in cooperation . Appealing to traditional American values , he called for town meetings in which a group of rural neighbors might " exact every advantage over the utility companies . " Insull talked about " manto-man " conferences and " intelligent compromise " ; it would all be for the greatest good for the greatest number.12 Of course , the power company held all the aces in such bargaining . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line remained : profit for the stockholders . The private power interests formed impressive political and economic groups ; for example , the Committee on the Relation of Electricity to Agriculture . This committee represented NELA , the American Farm Bureau Association , the American Home Economics Association , the American Society of Agricultural Engineers , the National Association of Farm Equipment Manufacturers , and a number of other trade organizations . Also included on the committee were the Departments of Agriculture , Commerce , and Interior.13 Such a powerful combination of economic and political interests should have resolved the issue of rural electrification , but it could // not do so . Although Insull and others proclaimed in 1930 that " rural electrification has been made possible by the rise of the great utility investment companies , " the statistics tell a different story , revealing a utility monopoly that was indifferent to public interest . This monopoly did not go unnoticed . During the late 1920s , even as Marcellus Jacobs , was working toward perfecting his windelectric plant , the utility power brokers came under increased attack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pennsylvania , proclaimed that " there is an electric power monopoly . " That monopoly , he said , is organized " for ruthless exploitation , uninterrupted and unrestrained by anything approaching effective Government intervention and control . " 14 Recognizing the growing importance of electricity , Pinchot predicted that " before very many years it will be not the hand that rocks the cradle , ' but the hand that turns the electric switch that will rule the land . " Pinchot pointed out that Insull controlled not only the Middle West Utilities Company but five other companies , too ? a total service area of more than twelve million people . To expose the domination of the power business by the utility holding companies , Pinchot organized his Giant Power Survey , an investigation into the policies of holding companies in Pennsylvania . To lead the investigation , Pinchot picked Morris Cooke , an energetic engineer who today would rate the description of social activist . Cooke took the job seriously , and although he failed to entice private utility companies to serve rural areas ? and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him well when later he became administrator of the Tennessee Valley Authority ( TVA ) , and then head of the Rural Electrification Administration . In this vast power struggle over electricity supply , the independent wind plant became one of the victims . New Deal TVA chief David E. Lilienthal noted that early in the century " the supply of electricity began as a local enterprise . Throughout the country , separate electric generating plants and distribution facilities were // set up in each community . " 15 Lilienthal was referring primarily to towns , but the same could be said of rural America . The first rural electric service consisted of independent plants ? well over 300,000 of them by 1930.16 But , like Lilienthal 's small-community power systems , they gave way to the great engineering developments and what Lilienthal called " the financial wizards . " Efficiency emerged victorious , but in certain respects the people lost . Independent electrical systems , although clearly inferior to central systems in capacity , served thousands of rural families . Although many might have agreed with Clara Jensen , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old windcharger because it was always breaking down , an equal number found that central power did not create an electrical paradise in the countryside 17 Central power did not preserve the family farm ; nor did it halt the drift to urban centers . Historian Katherine Kay Jellison maintains that , in fact , electricity and new technology drove farm families from the land , since " fewer . . . were actually needed on the land . " Those that did remain found that to pay for the increased investment in technology , the women often " used the family automobile to travel to wage-paying town jobs . " " 1935 : ENTER THE REA Into this situation of vacuum ? with only scattered use of individual power systems and failure on the part of the private utilities to provide rural electricity ? stepped the federal government . In 1935 , President Franklin D. Roosevelt 's New Deal administration created the REA , acting under authority of the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act . The REAs mission was to " initiate , formulate , administer and supervise a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmission and distribution of electric energy in rural areas . " In that same year , public fear of the utility holding companies resulted in passage of the Public Utility Holding Company // Act . This measure reined in the companies , limiting profits and lowering rates . The two pieces of legislation brought some relief and a ray of hope to rural Americans 19 Roosevelt named Morris Cooke ? a person superbly qulified for the task ? to head the REA 20 Cooke quickly convened a formal conference of sixteen leading utility executives and asked for their cooperation in providing electricity to farmers . After a three-month study , these executives reported that " there are very few farms requiring electricity . . . that are not now served . " Their recommendation was that the government " consider the immediate urge for rural electrification as a social rather than an economic problem " 21 Where an economic problem might exist , the report suggested , the federal government should subsidize rural power lines . These lines , however , would be owned by the local utility company , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had hoped to hear . Politely rejecting the offer , he ended the brief honeymoon between REA and private power . Intermixed with the technical discussion there lingered a political perception that as long as That Man Roosevelt continued in office , the utility CEOs would not cooperate.22 In the months that followed , Cooke and his engineers and advisors made progress . First , under the leadership of Senator George Norris they convinced Congress to pass the Rural Electrification Act , which Roosevelt gladly signed into law on May 20 , 1936 . The act not only gave the REA permanence , but opponents could no longer argue that REA was simply the creation of a presidential decree , lacking the support of the legislative branch . Second , Cooke and his staff hammered out a modus operandi for the agency . Farmers would be encouraged to organize cooperatives and then apply for low-interest federal loans to buy equipment and string the lines . These farmer-cooperatives would have to comply with certain standards . One of the most important involved density . A Canadian interested in rural electrification , Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had determined that rural electrification was feasible with a density of three farms per mile of line . Cooke and his assistants adopted this standard 23 Obviously , in the sparsely inhabited West ? and not only the West ? this rule would leave much room for independent wind-electric plants . Meaantime , the manufacturers of wind and gasoline electric plants were standing by , accepting their fate and hoping for scraps of business in isolated areas . But the private power companies were not so compliant : they disputed and occasionally destroyed the new public effort . Organizers , paid by the companies , ridiculed the farmer-cooperative efforts , and occasionally a power company would hastily construct a parallel " spite line " to compete with ( and ruin ) an REA line . But the REA survived and prospered , as farmercooperatives , loans , and expertise brought electricity to much of rural America 24 It was a social revolution . But there were also misrepresentations and injustices . REA officials invariably neglected to note the presence of independent electrical plants on the nation 's farms . Morris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congressman regarding his definition of central service , the REA head noted that " Delco is not included " ? meaning , by Delco , the company that manufactured wind and gasoline independent power plants . Cooke believed Delco would not object to the stringing of high lines , because the company favored rural development . " If service is established , " maintained Cooke , " then the Delco people can come in and make almost as much in selling refrigerators and other apparatus that uses high line service as selling their own plants . " 25 Cooke 's explanation implied that Delco should do some restructuring , essentially quitting the power-producing business to concentrate on power-consuming products . Companies that manufactured only power-producing units would of course be out of luck . Neither Cooke nor any other REA official addressed the reality of displaced technology . They would argue ad infinitum as to // whether service should be provided by private companies or public agencies , but it was always within a context of dedication to central service . That was not questioned . REA engineers and cooperative officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their definition to central power . Private and public power administrators employed the term electric service , implying that bona fide electricity must be transported over lines from a central power source . They seemed to forget , or perhaps deny , the reality implicit as early as 1926 in an article in Agricultural Engineering : " Notwithstanding the tendency of most people to define rural electric service as a means of extending . . . electric lines , it must be borne in mind that the individual electric plant has been the means of introducing electric service into many thousands of farms in the United States by providing energy for lighting and small power purposes . " 26 Another criticism of the REA ? which seemed to be above reproach ? focused on its claims to democratic process and localism . REA officials undoubtedly embraced the idea of local control , but the reality was often different . For example , the loan contract , a document that shaped the local cooperative 's rates and policies , underscored farmers ' growing dependency on the federal government . And the required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington , made it evident ? according to a recent study ? that although it was " designed to emphasize local organization of democratic cooperatives , " farmers were nevertheless " brought into closer contact with Washington bureaucracy than ever before . " 27 Without question , thousands of farm homes welcomed REA power as an unmitigated blessing ; it was a form of freedom from a world of drudgery28 But , viewed from another perspective , central power merely added another nail in the coffin of debt and dependency that has plagued the American farmer throughout the twentieth century . As historian David E. Nye points out , " neither big government nor advanced technology was necessarily // consistent with maximizing democracy or preserving the small farmer , and rural electrification certainly would not recognize the agrarian dream of a decentralized blend of technology and Jeffersonianism. " 29 For all the convenience and efficiency it brought , rural central power assisted in a dramatic displacement of people . In 1910 , half of the nation 's population lived on farms , by 1950 , this figure was one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on farms.3 ? Wind-plant companies were fond of advertising that the plant would be " the hired hand " and this proved to be even more true of the energy offered by the central system . The REA might be said to have marked the passage of the small farmer and the emergence of agribusiness . The national commitment to a hard energy path ( central power produced by fossil fuels ) appeared to lead to an energy cornucopia , but that pathway included pitfalls that were not evident in the late 1930s to the supremely self-confident , dedicated officials of the REA . For those committed to central power , the path seemed to be so straight and true that they sometimes put pressure on unpersuaded farmers . Many regions did not qualify for the three-hookups-permile rule , but even when they did some farmers were reluctant to get aboard . Often these were farm or ranch owners who already had an independent generating system . Robert Brown , a farmerrancher from Hershey , Nebraska , recalled that with his wind plant " we used to generate all the electricity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended its lines to his place and wanted to hook him up . " We said no , " said Brown , " but two years later they came back and we finally said yes . " Certainly , a factor in his decision was the attraction of trouble-free electricity . But so was the pressure of the cooperative 31 Fred Bruns , the farmer-mechanic who installed more than two hundred Jacobs plants , was another to recall the use of pressure on wind-plant owners 32 Paul Jacobs , son of inventor Marcellus , believes that intimidation continues to this day . In an // interview , Jacobs claimed that utility companies fear " wind energy would run them out of business " 33 In fact , REA investigators had to determine if there were enough homes to justify a loan and it does not take much imagination to understand that some local REA advocates manipulated and in-fluenced families , pressuring them to sign up . This must have often required a degree of salesmanship and persuasion , for if a rancher hooked up to REA , he would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association , a political lobby group , admitted that obtaining a right-of-way from property owners was sometimes difficult , " but usually the combination of neighborhood pressure and tact got the job done . " 35 In the 1990s , it is difficult to find evidence that independent energy plants existed and that the owners of these plants did not always welcome REA central power . However , in 1940 , a Kansas State College rural electrification survey of two counties ( Harvey and Dickinson ) revealed that many farmers who relied on their own electric plants were not interested in forming REA cooperatives . Approximately 175 private units were operated in Harvey County . This number included 3 110-volt plants , 65 32-volt plants , 106 6-volt plants , and 1 12-volt plant . Dickinson County tallied a total of 215 plants " of various kinds " 36 The survey gathered a lot of material . Although most of the statistical data can not be used to make direct comparisons between central power costs and independent units , the study did figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a 1,000-watt wind-driven plant . The engine could out-produce the wind plant , but the wind-energy plant cost only $7.39 per month ; the gasoline engine cost more than double , $16.34 . Significantly , the survey found that " there seems to be no great desire for electric service on the part of many farmers in Harvey County . " Part of the reluctance stemmed from the hard times of the depression , // but other farmers were satisfied with their independent systems . The report noted : The ownership of a private plant indicates a favorable attitude toward the use of electricity and those who have such equipment are considered good prospects for high-line service . But these plants have in many cases proved to be an obstacle to community action in securing high-lines . Owners of private plants , often the better farmers , have money invested in their plants and are in general well pleased with the service they are getting . It is natural that the owners would not want to junk their plants and join the high-line immediately . This is particularly true of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the initial cost , depreciation , and interest are ignored ) . A few instances have been found where , under the impression that the service would be cheaper , the farmer preferred to purchase his own plant rather than join the high-line.37 The evidence of this report is that rural people were far from being of one accord regarding central power . Many people found that their wind-electric systems provided both functional value and energy independence , two traits with deep roots in rural America . Perhaps some of the farmers in Dickinson and Harvey Counties derived psychological benefit in turning a negative environmental force ? the wind ? into a positive economic factor . Creating energy from the wind can effect a ranching family 's attitude toward what has been known to be a disturbing phenomenon 38 THE PARADOX Certainly , throughout the first half of the century many people , in the United States and elsewhere , exhibited what one historian called " a distaste for rapid progress , without rejecting industrialization . " 39 Historian and antimodernist Henry Adams had somber misgivings about the accelerated rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientist of renown to advocate wind-energy use , // feared the dissipation of energy supplies would lead to the downfall of civilization . And farm parents may have viewed central power as an extension of the corrupt city : electricity was just one more lure to snatch away their children . Like other groups , the Dickinson County and Harvey County families held opposing and paradoxical views . Some were satisfied with independent energy plants ; others welcomed REA power as a means of joining consumer society ; and some fell in between . Historian Don Kirschner caught the ambiguity of such beliefs . In a book about the 1920s , he writes : Farmers had been walking a narrow line between their values , which led them in one direction , and their materialistic appetites , which pulled them in another . Their values committed them to the natural , the simple , and the serene ; they exalted the independence of rural life and the primacy of things spiritual ; they condemned the city as the source of all evil . And yet ? and here is the paradox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Kirschner believed that U.S. farmers of the post World War I era " no longer walked the line between their values and their material commitment ; they had crossed it , they had made their choice " 40 Reasonably prosperous farmers such as many of those in Dickinson and Harvey Counties had already crossed the line to the intermediate technology of a wind-energy . For them , that ? for then ? was far enough . The Kansas State College survey concluded that " complete electrification of the farms in Harvey or Dickinson County does not appear to be practicable under present circumstances . " 41 The report did not suggest that the independent farmers should be encouraged , subsidized , or assisted in any way : the " uneven playing field " would become evident to recalcitrant farmers in time and REA would have its way . // Given the support of farmers such as those mentioned in the Kansas survey , it is surprising that the manufacturers of small power plants did nothing to oppose the invasion of the REA into their market . As noted earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind-energy companies did not . For Marcellus Jacobs and Samuel Insull to have united in fighting the REA would have requried the making of impossible compromises . Insull stood for monopoly , Jacobs for individualism . One championed systems consolidation ; the other favored self-sufficiency and decentralization . Even if they had found common ground , the private utilities would have little entertained ideas from a tiny industry struggling for survival . In truth , the wind-energy industry had much in common with the REA . Both had the welfare of rural America at heart 42 Both wished to restore , as David Lilienthal would say about REA , " democratic control over electricity . " 43 They disagreed on the means to that end . Wind-plant advocates favored individualism and a decentralized blend of technology , whereas the REA pushed for democratic cooperatives and centralism . LOSING OUT IN CONGRESS I believe ... it would be more economically feasible to use individual electric generating plants rather than running powerline systems to these remote farms . -R . F WEINIG , WIND PLANT MANUFCTURER , BEFORE A CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE , 1945 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a lack of group organization or cooperation . Like the equipment they sold to farmers , each company stood alone . They had no trade association to deal with common problems . They had no lobbying apparatus by which to argue their case . Thus , the wind industry // did nothing to question the objectives or methods of the REA cooperatives . They ceded the main meal , hoping for a few scraps . Service to isolated ranchers and farmers represented one way wind energy and the REA might have worked in harmony . When , in 1945 , R. F. Weinig , vice president and general manager of Wincharger Corporation , appeared before a subcommittee of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce he had in mind salvaging a few scraps . He represented Wincharger Corporation , but since no wind-energy trade association existed he claimed to be also the self-appointed , unofficial representative of his industry . Weinig conceded to congressmen that high-line power gave superior service ; however , he contended , in some areas it simply was not feasible . Using REA data , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said 2.5 or 3.0 farm families per mile were necessary to make a cooperative REA venture successful . Weinig quoted statistics that showed that in seventeen states west of the Mississippi River , more than one million farms and ranches were in areas where such operations averaged only 1.1 to the square mile . " There are 500,000 farms that average only 0.6 farm to the square mile , " he noted , " less than one-fourth of the minimum required density . " 44 Weinig suggested that families on such farms had three choices : they could remain " unelectrified " ; they could be given REA lines , but the district would not be self-supporting and would place a burden on more populous areas ; or they could be encouraged to install individual plants . Weinig , of course , favored the latter . " I believe , " he said , " that it would be more economically feasible to use individual electric generating plants rather than running powerline systems to these remote farms . " 45 Weinig provided data showing that the more powerful Wincharger then in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ample for the average farm . He did not envision an all-electric farm , but said the wind generator would provide electricity for efficient lighting and stationary rotary // engines . Natural or bottled gas would be necessary for cooking , heating , and hot water ; a tractor would operate any heavy motors . Weinig presented statistics showing wind plants to be both dependable and economical and noted that the Canadian government had provided loans to rural residents for wind plants . Weinig suggested that H. R. 1742 ( the rural electrification legislation ) be amended so that the REA program would provide ten-year , low-interest loans to farmers and ranchers for individual energy plants in sparsely settled areas46 Under questioning , Weinig noted that most wind plants operated in the western United States ; he also maintained that the maximum loan period allowable under the Federal Housing Authority was three years . Perhaps the most interesting question at the hearing came from Congressman Hinshaw , who wanted to know how , if the proposed amendment became law , the REA would handle the situation ? " Would you propose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rent the equipment or that they merely finance the ownership of the equipment on a chattel mortgage ? " Wisely , Weinig avoided the question . It would require considerable study by the government , he said . Both he and Hinshaw agreed , however , that , whatever system the government supported , a maintenance service would be needed to assure that if a wind plant broke down it would be promptly repaired.47 Weinig made a respectable presentation and gave competent answers to the congressmen 's questions , but his efforst were in vain . Legislators abandoned the amendment . Essentially , Weinig could find no support among the nation 's energy brokers . The Rural Electrification Administration , the Tennessee Valley Authority , and the utility companies were wedded to central power systems . They had no patience ( not even a frame of reference ) for anything so different and ? to them ? primitive . In neither manufacturing literature nor magazine articles have wind plants been represented as competitive with central power . // Even the most laudatory article on wind-energy plants , published in 1938 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is recommended wherever it can economically be made available . Wind electric plants are in no sense to be considered competitive , for their field logically commences where the high line ends . " 48 Weinig , of course , assumed that there would be an end to the high line ? somewhere remote , out there in America . He believed that the REA would abide by its three-to-a-mile rule . It did not : politics intervened . For rural congressmen ( Lyndon Johnson is one example ) bringing central REA power to their districts represented a victory that would ensure reelection . Johnson would have moved mountains to get REA , and trampling the three-to-a-mile rule proved no great task . He was not alone . But if the high line did not end , no service area remained for wind-energy plants . Other significant factors worked against Weinig 's proposal . At that point in the nation 's energy history , leaders pursued the potential of nuclear power and even more complex systems of distribution . The tiny Wmcharger and Jacobs plants had no place in the grandiose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving loan-subsidies for individual energy plants could not be seriously considered . Thus , for a series of reasons , the wind-energy business slipped again into the doldrums . Whereas , in 1946 , the Sears Roebuck catalogue offered the Farm-Master wind plant in either 500W ( $98.80 ) or 1000W ( $176.00 ) models , as well as towers , batteries , and a little Silvertone Aircharger for a radio , in 1947 the company discontinued all such products 49 In the 1950s , the major wind-plant manufacturers went out of business . The Wincharger Corporation ceased production of all but a tiny plant in 1956 ; that same year the Jacobs Wind Electric Company closed its Minneapolis factory . The industry lay dormant , a victim of the REA and its own inability to fight for a share of the market . By the close of 1948 , 4,388,200 farms and ranches had received central electric service : 51.2 percent of these were served by power // companies , 43.7 percent by REA cooperatives , and 5 percent by municipal or other government agencies . This figure represented 75 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farms and ranches remained beyond the high line , but their owners anticipated // eventually receiving service . A 1947 article in Successful Farming lauded the success of wind-energy plants in North Dakota , but the article also implied that wind power was second best : a stopgap measures ' By 1950 a Successful Farming article was telling readers not to tear down the wind-plant tower , for it could be put to good use for a television antenna , the communications marvel that was not available with a 32-volt electrical system.52 A few farmers and ranchers held on . When , in 1940 , REA cooperative officials had approached Joe Spinhirne , a West Texas farmer with a spread west of Amarillo , he felt the high-line offer was too expensive . When his neighbors hooked up , he bought their obsolete 32-volt appliances at dirt cheap prices ; he even purchased a discarded Jacobs plant for $100 . In the mid-1980s , Spinhirne was still generating his own electricity with the reliable Jacobs . He had become a sort of cultural icon , a folk hero , because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer labeled him a crafty independent , gifted with " uncanny foresight " 53 In truth , his independence reflected neither philosophical nor ecological principles , but economic rebellion . He continued to refuse to pay the local REA cooperative 's hook-up fee , which he considered to be oppressively high 54 Spinhirne is an exception . Although he represents the spirit of those Kansas farmers in Dickinson County and Harvey County , such hold-outs are rare . Most rural Americans found the attraction of high-line , reliable power irresistible . Independent wind systems could not match the temptations of modernism . The demise of the Jacobs company and the severe scaling back of Wmcharger signified the drift of the times . // IN THE DOLDRUMS , BUT PUTNAM AND THOMAS EMERGE The great wind-turbine on a Vermont mountain proved that men could build a practical machine which would synchronously generate electricity in large quantities by means of windpower. - VANNEVAR BUSH ENGINEERS PAID LITTLE ATTENTION TO THE DEMISE OF THE SMALL , individual wind-electric systems ; the turbines , after all , were so diminutive that their loss was inconsequential . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Marcellus Jacobs could build a wind plant to serve a ranch , could an engineer build a larger unit to serve a town ? Could a series of these large machines serve a city ? And if it is feasible to construct a series of wind generators , could their electricity feed into existing power networks ? In short , could American engineers build a large and sophisticated wind turbine ? In the 1930s , a young engineer named Palmer Cosslett Putnam asked these questions and did his best to answer them by building a huge wind plant , 1.5-megawatt ( 1500kW ) , on the top of a Vermont mountain known as Grandpa 's Knob . However , Putnam was not the first to build one of what engineers presently term Large Wind Generator Systems ( LWGS ) . In 1933 , near the windswept Balaclava region of the Crimea , Russian engineer // V. N. Krasnovsky directed the construction of a 100-kilowatt wind-mill power station . The wind plant featured a three-blade wheel , thirty meters in diameter , that Krasnovsky placed on a tower twenty-five meters off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measured thirteen meters in length and could accommodate two operators . The nacelle and rotor sat on a large , rotating , ball-bearing wheel . The Russian engineers began generation of power at twenty revolutions of the propeller per minute . After a few successful months , they increased the rpm to thirty . ' Aside from its dimensions , the Balaclava wind turbine 's unique ness lay in a synchronous converter , which allowed the direct current ( DC ) to be converted to alternating current ( AC ) . Once that was accomplished , the three-phase current , at 220 volts , could be fed into the central system . Thus , the wind plant had no standby gasoline ; engine nor did it have a battery-storage system . Soviet Union engineers had solved one of the most difficult obstacles to the practical use of large wind plants ? how to integrate them into central grid systems .2 By 1935 , the Russians had operated the wind plant successfully for two years . The Electrical Times , of London , reported that " the Russian engineers are so pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extending over two years , in parallel with the local Crimean network , that they are designing plants of greater capacity on similar lines . " 3 Evidently they planned to erect multiple machines , which in effect would amass into the first wind-electric generating station . Priorities changed within Russia and the exi gencies of World War II altered these plans . The solitary Russian 100kW machine ran for ten years , but when it failed during the war years engineers dismantled it. ? Palmer Putnam followed the Russian experiment with particular interest . Practical visionaries are a rarity . Usually , a person is either practical or a visionary , but seldom do such qualities mesh . In the case of Putnam , however , they did . He came from a publishing // background , and was president and chairman of the board of G. P. Putnam 's , Sons , from 1930 to 1932 . However , Palmer Putnam was more devoted to invention and engineering , and he demonstrated skill in both . Putnam 's interest in wind energy originated in a pragmatic way . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he put it , " found both the winds and the electric rates surprisingly high : ' 5 He thought of wind energy , intending to have the utility company both maintain standby service and also purchase from him surplus wind-generated electricity . However , no mechanism existed that would convert DC current to AC , facilitating compatibility between the two systems . Putnam researched the problem and soon the economies of scale captured his engineer 's imagination . He concluded that " if an economically attractive solution to the problem existed , it lay in the direct generation of alternating current by a very large , twobladed , high-speed windmill , feeding into the lines of an existing hydro , or steam and hydro , system .6 He would demonstrate that such a novel form of energy creation was both economical and practical . Putnam had in mind a machine over two hundred feet in height : it would dwarf both the Brush wind dynamo and the Russian Balaclava experiment . In a 30mph wind , it would generate 1,000 kilowatts ( 1MW ) , and in higher winds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian experiment , nothing approaching this scale existed . A successful experiment would require basic research . Perhaps , a few decades later , Putnam would have been awarded a grant from a government agency , but he chose to work through private industry . S. Morgan Smith Company , manufacturers of hydraulic turbines , were seeking a way to diversify their product line and wind turbines offered an interesting possibility . The company 's directors decided to underwrite the project . Putnam took primary responsibility for the project , but he also sought the best scientific advice available ; he was a team player . // Vannevar Bush , then dean of engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( later , during World War II , to be Putnam 's boss at the Office of Scientific Research and Development ) suggested preliminary studies relating to the economy of scale , and then assisted in the research ? Professor Theodore von Karman , of the California Institute of Technology , assisted in the general design and John F Haines , of Engineering Projects , Dayton , Ohio , conducted wind-tunnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) designed the blades , which were then built by the Edward G. Budd Manufacturing Company . The Woodward Governor Company , of Rockford , Illinois , built the speed-control system and Wellman Engineering and General Electric provided expertise with complex electrical mechanisms . The Budd company designed the tower , which was built by American Bridge .8 The project represented a successful partnership between university and private industry talent . As Vannevar Bush put it in the introduction to a book Putnam published in 1948 , the project was " conceived and carried through free enterprisers who were willing to accept the risks involved in exploring the frontiers of knowledge , in the hope of financial gain . " 9 Designed during the depression years , it put idle hands and bright minds to work . Where would Putnam erect this remarkable wind plant , which had surely outgrown his Cape Cod home site ? After a considerable amount of anemometer research ? balloons were sent up to monitor air-flow over potential sites and tree growth was noted as indication of wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in June , 1940 , Putnam announced the choice of Grandpa 's Knob in the Green Mountains of Vermont , twelve miles from the town of Rutland . The site boasted several advantages . Except for hunters in search of deer and other game , people rarely tarried in the forest of the Knob . But , of course , Putnam chose the site primarily for the wind . At 2000-foot elevation , air currents were generally steady and strong // ( up to 140 mph were registered ) , but not turbulent . Having chosen a site , Putnam was ready to begin construction . Foresters denuded the knoll , exposing a rocky base , and the assembly team delivered components of the windmill to the Vermont Marble Company plant in Rutland . Assembly itself began during the winter of 1941 . Just getting the materials to the top of the Knob proved a herculean task . Two fifteen-degree grade hairpin turns proved particularly challenging , requiring an extra tractor in front as well as a bulldozer pushing from the rear.10 Truckers eventually hauled some five hundred tons of parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " On one of the hairpin turns , the only serious mishap occurred . On a windy , subzero day , the crew inched a forty-ton pintle girder on a flatbed truck up the mountain with the aid of two tractors . On the turn , the girder broke free , rolled off the truck , and landed , upside down , in a snow bank . Fortunately , no one was injured and the girder survived undamaged 12 Considering the novelty and the scale of the project , construction foremen had few problems . Not only did they raise the huge tower , assemble the generating equipment , and attach the mammoth blades , they also constructed a so-called bombproof building to house an air-research laboratory and the " electric brain " to control the unit 13 The bombproof construction did not reflect a security concern , but rather was an engineer 's response to the physical environment . Putnam feared that ice would build up on the giant blades in winter ? and , with a potential blade-tip speed of 15,785 feet per minute at 28.7 rpm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurl ice chunks with projectile-like speed as far as 900 feet . " The building had to be tough in face of such impact potential 14 Construction continued through the summer of 1941 . By August , the final touches were being made and , on October 19 , the Smith/ Putnam plant started generating electricity . It operated for approximately sixteen months , producing 298,240kWh in 695 hours of on-line production.15 On February 20 , 1943 , a bearing failed at the // downwind end of the main shaft . In early 1943 , with national priorities focused on the war effort , Putnam and his colleagues went to work at the Office of Scientific Research and Development , designing amphibious landing craft and experimenting with an exotic snow machine for use in covert military operations in Norway . He had little time or energy for his crippled wind turbine ' 6 Twenty-four months passed before workers found and installed a new main bearing and the wind turbine came back on-line . However , within weeks an even more catastrophic event disabled the turbine forever . At 3:10 a.m. on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 20mph , one of the blades separated from the rotor , careening to the ground and on down the side of the mountain . Three months later , Putnam described the event for Power magazine : The operator on duty aloft heard nothing , but suddenly felt considerable motion and , working his way against this to the control panel , made a quick manual shut-down in about 2 or 3 seconds . Fifteen seconds may have elapsed after the operator first felt motion , before he brought the turbine to rest . During this time the turbine completed six or seven revolutions with only one blade attached . " Three years later , in his book Power from the Wind , Putnam described the event in more dramatic terms : Harold Perry , who had been the erection foreman , and was a powerful man , was on duty aloft . Suddenly he found himself on his face on the floor , jammed against one wall of the control room . He got to his knees and was straightening up to start for the control panel , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , got off the floor , hurled his solid 225 pounds over the rotating 24-inch main shaft , reached the controls , and brought the unit to a full stop in about 10 seconds . ' $ Inspection showed that a number of cracks had developed along the blade spar , particularly at the bolted shank/spar connection . Inspection of the one surviving blade also revealed cracks . Putnam presumed that stress and fatigue caused the mishap . // The disastrous collapse did not discourage Putnam . He saw the crash of the blade simply as part of the pitfalls of a new technology . In Power magazine , he reassured readers that " we believe we can design and build wind turbines that will be entirely practical . ... REBUILDING OF THE UNIT IS UNDER WAY . " 19 But rebuilding did not occur ? for several reasons . First , the materials were difficult to obtain . At a time when wartime restrictions were still in force , the wind plant had not been designated as a priority . Second , replacing the blades would have been costly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project had been " conceived and carried through free enterprisers who were willing to accept the risks involved in exploring the frontiers of knowledge , in the hope of financial gain . 1120 This was certainly true , and to their credit the board of directors and stockholders of the S. Morgan Smith Company had made an investment of over a million dollars with very little return . The company could not be expected to do more . And third , although wind energy was fascinating , engineers considered it to be irrelevant . Nuclear energy was on the horizon , and both the private sector and government were geared toward investing in what appeared to be the ultimate solution to the question of energy supply . But the Smith/Putnam wind plant had demonstrated that wind , that exotic power source , could be harnessed on a large scale . Writing in 1948 , Vannevar Bush pronounced : " The great windturbine on a Vermont mountain proved that men could build a practical machine which would synchronously generate electricity in large quantities by means of windpower. " 21 Bush went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already existing army of small scale-wind plants , he forecast that " at some future time homes may be illuminated and factories may be powered by this new means . " Whether or not Bush was aware of the thousands of Jacobs and Wincharger machines that lit homes throughout rural America , he // could be excused for stating his prediction in these terms : his engineering proclivities lent themselves to the large and the complex . Putnam and his scientific cohorts thought only in terms of grid systems ? such as that of the Central Vermont Public Service Corporation . For them , the genius of their wind machine was not only its size but the fact that it fed into an AC central system . This was a significant achievement . In 1942 , engineer John Wilbur wrote : " Alternating current is being developed from wind energy for the first time 1122 Putting it in layman 's terms , Wilbur explained that " this requires careful speed regulation , since it becomes necessary to drive the AC generator , which in this instance is synchronous , at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order that the frequency of the system to which the wind turbine is con-nected may be matched . " Putnam and his team collected a disparate , chaotic energy source and integrated it into a steady , orderly system ? an engineering challenge that required skill and patience . The Central Vermont Public Service Corporation executives had recognized that wind power would be most efficient when used in concert with a hydroelectric system and Wilbur explained that in such a case , when the wind blew , the hydroelectric units could be shut , retaining the water in storage ; when the wind ceased , the water could be released to generate power . Such a system raised total power output significantly . " In effect , " wrote Wilbur , " when the wind is blowing , wind energy can be stored by means of the water withheld in the reservoirs . 1123 This symbiotic relationship of the two primary kinetic energy sources ? wind and water ? has been often recognized since the 1940s and has been employed successfully in more recent projects . Although the Smith/Putnam turbine succeeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of scale . The expense of repairs in the event of a breakdown proved to be prohibitive . The task of replacing and repairing machinery 120 feet above terra firma was painfully expensive ? if parts and labor were available at all . Putnam , // as Vannevar Bush noted , built the wind plant in the hope of profit . Breakdowns eliminated this hope . The expense of putting the plant back into operation would have been in the neighborhood of $300,000 , an outlay that the Smith company could not justify . 4 A smaller plant could reduce such costs : economy of scale might be realized through multiple , medium-sized units ? not by huge plants such as Grandpa 's Knob . After the March 1945 disaster , the Smith/Putnam machine never again operated . Putnam placed patents in the public domain , then shifted his engineering skills in new directions ? primarily toward nuclear power . But his legacy still has an impact . Almost thirty years after the last revolution of his wind turbine , in an era of new interest in alternative energy , engineers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . " Speaking in 1974 , electrical engineer William L. Hughes allowed that Putnam 's machine " was really the precursor of all of the wind work that is being done today . " z5 PERCY THOMAS ? PUSHING THE WIND Whether wind power will advance to any great extent in the future , or whether the need will be obviated by nuclear development only time will tell . - ENGINEERNG JOURNAL , 1953 That thirty-year period was , in fact , the nadir of modern interest in wind energy . Systematic , large-scale exploitation of the wind was not , however , without its advocates in the post World War II years . Percy H. Thomas , for one , eagerly followed the Grandpa 's Knob experiment from his office with the Federal Power Commission . Thomas , a high-ranking engineer , found an opportunity to jump into wind energy research when the Central Vermont Public // Service Company listed the Smith/Putnam wind turbine as one of its operating units . Since Congress charged the Federal Power Com-mission ( FPQ with studying the production of electric power ? in // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to continue a fascination he had felt since his college years at MIT . With the support of his boss ( William Warne ) , he began what turned out to be eight years of research ? from approximately 1943 to 1951 . Designing and building a major wind plant became an elusive life goal for Thomas . Later , he would testify that the opportunity to engineer something as novel as a huge wind-energy plant " happens once in a generation , and to be allowed to work on it is a very great pleasure . 1126 Thomas did not participate directly in the Grandpa 's Knob experiment , but he followed it so closely that he can be considered almost part of the team . He believed in wind power and the concept of renewable energy ; although a public servant , he profited by the activity of private industry . One might expect Thomas to have recognized that the economy of scale , with regard to repair costs , did not work to the advantage of the massive Smith/Putnam unit , but Thomas believed that the problem lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistakenly provided incorrect figures to the contractor . When the engineers realized the error , they could not afford the price tag ( $100,000 to $150,000 ) to correct it . Furthermore , according to Thomas , because of the prohibitive cost , the Smith/Putnam blades were not of the optimum shape 7 Through his association with private industry , and benefitting from the knowledge , experience , and past errors of Putnam and his staff , Thomas felt confident that he could build a trouble-free machine . The wind plants he proposed were unprecedented in both power and size . In the design of a 7,500-kilowatt plant ( 7.5MW ) , his largest , Thomas pushed the economy of scale to the limit . His design called for a 575-foot-high wind turbine , the blades reaching higher than the Washington Monument ? 8 Each of the six V-shaped legs of the tower would be approximately 280 feet across at its base , tapering upward in a manner somewhat resembling the Eiffel Tower.29 Besides being of extraordinary size , the Thomas model // was unique for its twin nacelles , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single tower , had never been designed before , nor has such a design been used since Thomas 's efforts . But to this visionary engineer , it made perfect sense . If an engineer designed an expensive and huge tower , why not maximize the available wind , using two rotors rather than one ? It was through this twin-rotor design and improved blades that Thomas expected to build to higher efficiency . He planned on a 7.5-megawatt output in a 34mph wind 30 Thomas and the Federal Power Commission administrators envisioned that such immense wind plants would be used in conjunction with hydroelectric production . In an illustration , Thomas showed three 7.5-megawatt plants , placed along a ridge , producing energy , with power lines stretching toward an industrial city . In the distance , power lines flowed from a reservoir and a hydropower house . Like Putnam and others , Thomas envisioned that his wind machines would operate in conjunction with the hydroelectric system . In Thomas 's words : In this case , the hydro-storage reservoirs and the other reserves provide for firming the hydrogeneration during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind energy , the storage thus serving double duty . This would seem to limit the capability of the storage for its hydro duties but since the deficiencies of the wind are limited to a few days while the water lack in the rivers is for months or even for a year , the use of the storage for firming the wind handicaps it very little in its original work . 31 Thomas excelled at designing , not explaining . His idea was that the two power sources could work well together , particularly in the West , where water was available but not abundant and wind was abundant but not necessarily available . With wind-energy development , water in reservoirs could be held until such time as the wind ceased to blow . // In 1950 ? seven years into his research ? Thomas and his superiors at FPC and the Department of the Interior prepared to take his ideas and plans before Congress , hoping to secure federal monies to build a demonstration wind generator . House bill 4286 ( 82nd Cong. , 1st Sess. ) would provide over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and construct a giant plant along the lines Thomas had proposed . Although a private company might act as the principal contractor , the power generated would be integrated into a federal project or system . The bill justified the experiment in order " to promote the conservation of the natural resources of the Nation and to aid in the national defense . " The wind machine ? not to exceed 10,000-kilowatt ( 10 MW ) capacity ? would also determine and demonstrate the feasibility of integrating windproduced electricity with that of more traditional and commercial energy sources . Other arguments for the development of windenergy systems included the fact that the " fuel " required no labor or transportation costs , that the units necessitated only a short construction schedule or lead time , and that the material requirements of such plants were minimal , particularly because no storage facilities would be involved 32 The references to conservation and national defense deserve further comment . The notion that the nation might exhaust its nonrenewable energy sources was not new , but the idea that companies might preserve those nonrenewable resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistant secretary of the interior William Warne explained to congressmen that wind-energy plants " might save oil that otherwise would be used as fuel in steam plants , " he was not advocating an altogether new concept , but it certainly had a fresh slant . Petroleum conservation had a long history and in 1951 almost every American knew firsthand of that policy through wartime gas rationing . But the possibility of substituting a renewable source of energy to preserve petroleum was relatively unheard of.33 // Noticeably , no government official or other advocate at the hearing played the pollution card . No one noted that by producing energy through wind power rather than oil or coal , a significant byproduct would be clear air . By the 1950s , air quality was deteriorating in such metropolitan areas as Los Angeles , but officials placed the blame solely on the automobile . It was too early for Americans to grasp the complexity of air pollution , or comprehend the difference between a clean plant and one that polluted . A more chilling concern for Americans at that time was national security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atomic bomb , years ahead of the predictions made by U.S. security experts . Senator Joe McCarthy roamed the halls of the Capitol and cold war paranoia seized the nation . A large number of citizens seemed prepared to believe him , and to subscribe to the reality of some outlandish plots ? such as the sabotage of the nation 's power centers . Decentralization of defense plants had proved a popular idea . Since government officials encouraged the placement of industrial plants in the countryside , should not the same apply to the energy source necessary to power such plants ? Wind energy had the great advantage of lending itself to decentralism , and assistant secretary William Warne , of Interior , noted the fact in his testimony . The aerogenerators " would be located in primarily isolated locations , " and the widely-dispersed , multiple plants would render the system " less vulnerable to damage from attack " 34 Decentralization of power production , so long discarded as unprogressive , had finally found an argument in its favor ? capitalizing on cold war fears . Warne also paraded national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hearing of the value of the project . He reminded the congressmen that although the nation had a wealth of water and fuel resources , " we can not afford to let other nations out do sic us in wind-power development " In other words , the United States must retain the technological edge ; when the nation // looked " toward the expansion of its power resources , " it would thus be ready , and not at square one.35 To some of the members of the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs , the expenditure of monies for such a novel idea proved daunting . Both Warne and Thomas assured the committee that although the experimental plant might cost $2.5 million or more , subsequent units " should be available to both private and public systems at a cost comparable to other types of generating equipment . " They believed that , after the initial cost of the prototype , " wind-power plants like it can be designed and built which will be competitive with both steam and hydro power . " 36 Asked about the possible location @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no site had yet been chosen . They had not conducted sufficient research to name the best location . But the site would be in the West , because it was to be integrated with a hydroelectric system operated by the Bureau of Reclamation . One possible site was noted : the Sherman Hill area of southeast Wyoming , near Laramie . This site offered sufficient wind and could be operated in tandem with bureau hydropower systems and nearby transmission lines 37 The committee received Thomas and Warne warmly . Curmudgeon Wayne Aspinall , of Colorado , said it was his opinion that the bill would not pass , but other committee members seemed supportive . Some members found themselves unable to ask substantive questions about such a novel idea . Hamer Budge , of Idaho , stated simply : " This would certainly be a wonderful thing if it works . " William Yorty , of California , was impressed . He found the possibilities " so attractive I do not see how we can afford not to use them " Congressman Fine , of New York , said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another subcommittee meeting and congresswoman Bosone , of Utah , bordered on the fulsome in praise of Thomas and his ideas . She believed him to be the archetype of the engineer with " honesty , humility , and scientific brain , and // the patriotic pursuits of the scientific idea . " She considered him " the greatest asset for the whole idea ? ' " But Aspinall 's prediction of failure proved accurate : the bill failed to survive the pitfalls and gauntlets of the legislative process and a similar bill was not presented later . Thomas 's engineering designs went untried and in the United States the development of knowledge about wind energy came to a standstill . In Denmark , France , and England , a little experimental work continued . One can point to a number of reasons for the defeat . The failure of the Grandpa 's Knob frequently provided the focus of discussion in the committee . The legislators considered Putnam 's blade failure to have proved the whole endeavor a washout . The engineers , Thomas , and Warne disagreed with this view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it operated on a commercial basis . " 39 Another factor was that the bill suffered from lack of a local advocate . Because the Department of the Interior had not chosen a site , no legislator , in either the House of the Senate , emerged as advocate . Bluntly put , the bill was no one 's pork barrel . Even given a different scenario ? if the Smith-Putnam turbine had performed perfectly and the political ducks had been all in a row ? funding of the Thomas project would still have been unlikely . The defeat of wind power in 1951 had more to do with outside forces and interests than with performance or potential . There was a hidden agenda : the international political climate and nuclear power . These nullified serious interest in wind energy . Shortly after the United States military dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki , bringing World War II to a conclusion , both scientists and politicians attempted to move the focus of atomic energy in a different direction . For understandable reasons , leaders preferred to stress not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this monumental new energy source could provide . By Christmas 1945 , Senator Brian McMahon had introduced a bill that called for such a new direction ? one away from the carnage of war . The // Congressional Declaration of Policy of the McMahon bill stated that , although the effect of civilian use of atomic energy could not be determined , " it is reasonable to anticipate . . . that tapping this new source of energy will cause profound changes in our present way of life . " 40 By late 1946 the bill became the McMahon Act , a legislative achievement that would turn the nuclear effort toward " improving the public welfare , increasing the standard of living , strengthening free competition among private enterprises so far as practicable , and cementing world peace . " ' " Americans now anticipated a nuclear age , and , surely , bountiful energy would be its hallmark . As David Lilienthal , former Tennessee Valley Authority head ( and , in late 1946 , the first chief of the AEC ? the Atomic Energy Commission ) stated : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't pay to meter it . " 42 Euphoric expectations surrounded the peacetime possibilities of nuclear power . This new development might effect U.S. society as profoundly as had the electric light , the telephone , the automobile , and the airplane combined . Scientists had developed something remarkable : a new primary energy source ? one that seemed to hold unlimited possibilities . Certainly most members of Congress embraced this promise and they provided lavish funding for the Atomic Energy Commission . Lilienthal noted : " Never had there been , anywhere in the world , so broad and generously financed an attack on the technical and economic problems of bringing a new scientific discovery into the realm of application and of widespread use . " 43 A later critic of nuclear energy development noted that by 1953 the AEC bureaucracy was so vast that it " owned and operated three towns ; it employed sixty-five thousand construction workers , five percent of the nation 's entire construction labor force ; it consumed ten percent of the country 's electric power . " By the close of that year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars , more than the // combined 1953 investment of General Motors , US Steel , Du Pont , Bethlehem Steel , Alcoa and G oodyear : ' 44 Was all this incredible cost worth it ? Perhaps it was , from a military or cold war perspective , but not for electricity production . By 1963 , Lilienthal had changed his mind . He distanced himself from nuclear power , stating that scientists had not demonstrated a way to dispose of the " furiously radioactive " byproducts . Furthermore , not a shred of evidence existed to indicate that nuclear power was the least expensive method of power production . Even if it was , the dangers involved if there were an accident were horrendous ? too horrendous to risk . Lilienthal favored a less glamorous power source , such as coal45 Lilienthal 's views were prescient , but he did not represent mainstream thinking . Congress was convinced by scientific experts that peaceful use of atomic power would transform society , and nuclear power plants would usher in that new society . A nuclear power plant here and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and certainly for wind machines ) . Thus , Congress appropriated billions of dollars for research and development of peaceful uses of nuclear energy , and not a cent for alternative forms of power production . The good scientific work of Palmer Putnam went for naught : scientists and engineers discarded that knowledge in their obsession with nuclear power . Congress chose wrong ; the taxpayers lost , and so did alternative energy development . // IN THE LEE OF THE ENERGY CRISIS , WIND PICKS UP Inventors and technicians will have to pay homage to windmills . They 'll have to build machines that use , not abuse , the unearned gifts of nature . - STUART UDALL , FORMER SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR , SPEAKING IN 1971 IN THE LATE 1950S AND EARLY 19605 , THE UNITED STATES BECAME ELECTRIFIED . All-electric homes became commonplace , as did office buildings featuring windows that did not open and lights that did not have light switches . The lights stayed on at all times ' Energy seemed limitless and Americans who , during the war had conserved , afterwards consumed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry promoters launched a campaign for consumption that proved so successful that in the two decades after World War II Americans increased their electric power usage by 7.8 percent each year , thus doubling consumption in ten years . It was what one writer called " a golden age for electric companies . " 2 With consumption progressing at a splendid rate , the industry faced a predicament . The seemingly ever-rising growth curve required expanded energy production : How would the demand be met ? Both investor-owned companies and public power companies might have looked to fresh possibilities ; instead , they retreated to // the dependable " hard energy path " ? that is , reliance on coal , oil , natural gas , and , in trivial amounts , nuclear.3 In Europe , however , experimentation with wind energy continued , particularly in France and Denmark . Denmark proved particularly successful with the 200kW Gedser turbine , using a 78-foot-diameter rotor . The Gedser proved both efficient and reliable , running continuously for ten years ( 1957-1967 ) .4 But the Danish turbine created nary a ripple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met through new fossilfuel plants . As for the future , most utility experts assumed that emerging nuclear technology would fill any gaps , providing an energy cornucopia to meet the most inflated energy forecast . Nuclear scientists were particularly enthusiastic , and not only for technological reasons . As a penetrating book put it : " For them , the transition to civilian atoms represented an indispensable social legitimation of their scientific interests , the irrefutable historic justification of the primacy of nuclear physics in the field of science and technology . " 5 Thus , the idea of redemption ( or guilt ) for the destructive power of the atomic bomb played a part in the scientific community 's dedication to nuclear power . These scientists found powerful allies . Perhaps at no time in U.S. history had the national leadership been so mesmerized by the potential of technological progress . This infatuation was not without cost to the taxpayer . Between June 1955 , and June 1964 , the federal government , primarily through the Atomic Energy Commission ( AEC ) , invested $27 billion in the development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributed only 12 percent toward the government-sponsored nuclear reactor program . Commercial nuclear power received a subsidy unparalleled in the U.S. experience .6 In spite of the AEC 's bureaucratic enthusiasm , utility companies were hesitant . With reason , they feared this awesome new power source . The potential financial liability of a China Syndrome ( meaning // an overheating and meltdown of uranium fuel rods ) struck dread into the hearts and heads of utility executives and their insurance companies . In spite of the AEC 's enormous financial support and constant encouragement , the utility companies refused to budge until 1963 ? In 1963 and 1964 , Westinghouse and General Electric offered turnkey nuclear plants at prices that were most attractive when compared with coal-fired plants . The two companies lost money on their bids , but nuclear reactor orders jumped from seven in 1965 to twenty in 1966 and to thirty in 1967 . That decade ( 1965 to 1975 ) represented a brief halcyon era for nuclear power . The environmental movement and the antinuclear forces had gained strength , but protesters were unable to slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached its high point in the early 1970s , when utility companies ordered an unprecedented number of nuclear reactors , partially in response to the 1973 oil crisis . Needless to say , it was a decade in which little thought was given to wind energy . Virtually no money was spent on wind research and development . Quite suddenly , the infatuation with nuclear plants came to a halt . Skyrocketing costs , increasing antinuclear protests , and indecision regarding nuclear waste all contributed to the turnaround . Utility companies had ordered 231 nuclear plants through 1974 ; after that , only 15 . Since 1978 , no plants have been completed . Most orders were canceled , and dozens of partially completed plants have been abandoned .8 The Three Mile Island incident ( 1979 ) , in which many of the vaunted safety features of a nuclear plant failed , causing radiation leakage and a near meltdown , shattered public confidence . Some years later , nuclear energy suffered another calamity when the nuclear plant at Chernobyl , in the Ukraine , exploded , spreading radiation damage and death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial front . When the five-plant nuclear project of the Washington Public Power Supply System ( WPPSS ) declared bankruptcy and defaulted on $2.25 billion dollars // worth of bonds in July 1983 , the struggling industry became moribund . One critic remarked that WPPSS " promised power without cost , and they delivered cost without power . " 9 It is ironic that recently some of the twenty-three utility companies that comprised WPPSS have considered wind power to meet their additional needs . In other countries , nuclear was running into similar problems10 and obstacles facing the development of large wind machines seem minuscule alongside the financial fiasco of nuclear development . One U.S. commentator noted ironically that records for the costliest single nuclear power plant cancellation are epic but transient ; Washington State 's 1982 mark of $2.3 billion gave way in the first month of 1984 to a still more robust $2.5 billion collapse in Indiana . Either New York 's Shoreham unit or New Hampshire 's Seabrook Station may seize the lead later this year 1984 , by abandoning the field after expenditures exceeding $3 billion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and technology , in concert with federal officials , promised so much and produced so little . It represented a major defeat for U.S. technology , and one that cost not only ratepayers but taxpayers , too , billions of dollars . Whether the nuclear power industry can be revived is questionable . Pronuclear advocates such as Bernard Cohen argue for the efficiency and safety of the nuclear option , but it is unlikely that the U.S. public will be convinced in the near futurelz The demise of nuclear power assisted in a resurrection of interest in wind energy , but it was not the only factor : other significant social concerns were coming together . The environmental movement , with origins in the early 1960s , came to a crescendo with Earth Day 1970.13 Significantly , the movement considered alternatives : alternative lifestyles and alternative energy sources . The new national mood questioned business as usual ? and that meant questioning the construction of more huge power plants . Nuclear // was unsafe and costly : fossil fuels consumed nonrenewable resources and polluted the air . By 1970 , pollution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polls surveying U.S. public opinion on major domestic problems in 1965 and 1970 indicated that the problem of " reducing pollution of air and water " had moved from a ranking of ninth to second place , exceeded only by " reducing crime . " 14 Congress and the president responded with the passage of the Clean Air Act of 1970 , placing more pressure on utility companies to reduce production of carbon dioxide ( a principal contributor to global warming ) , nitrogen oxides ( a cause of acid rain and air pollution ) , and polluting smoke and particulates . An energy source ? such as solar ? that was safe and left the environment unchanged seemed particularly attractive . Here and there , prominent leaders spoke of wind energy . Stuart Udall , who had been secretary of the interior under President John Kennedy , called wind generators " symbols of sanity in a world that is increasingly hooked on machines with an inordinate hunger for fuel and a prodigious capacity to pollute . " Udall praised wind generators as devices that " respect the laws and limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet the challenge of the future , " inventors and technicians will have to pay homage to windmills . They 'll have to build machines that use , not abuse , the unearned gifts of nature .. " 15 However , although the audience for such views was increasing , only a minority of Americans thought in such terms . Many utility companies , seeking a prompt solution , chose the so-called hard energy path , switching from coal to oil . This move turned out to be only a Band-Aid for a seriously sick industry . Americans , becoming increasingly aware of the health hazards of electricity produced by oil or coal , wanted change . In 1973 , the U.S. Senate held hearings on a bill aimed at providing research funds to produce " electric energy with minimum impact upon the environment . " // In opening the hearings , Senator Frank Moss , of Utah , voiced the feeling of millions of Americans : For many years such work producing energy with minimum impact on the environment was neglected by both the Federal Government and the industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The Nation is chronically faced with the threat of power brownouts and blackouts , citizens oppose the construction of electric facilities , fossilfuel electric powerplants rank with the automobile as the Nation 's worst polluter , and our energy systems are extremely inefficient ? twothirds of the fuel consumed to generate electricity is discarded as waste heat . ' 6 But no matter how logical or necessary Senator Moss ' appeal , such views were not the key for most Americans . It was inflated oil prices and gasoline shortages at the pumps that forced people to reevaluate . In 1973 , the cost of oil skyrocketed , a consequence of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) October oil embargo . This embargo had deep roots . Factors involved included the multinational energy companies , a valuable natural resource that was priced too cheaply , and the continual political turmoil of the Middle East . " These roots had , in 1959 , tapped a reservoir of Arab bitterness over colonialism and exploitation and resulted in the formation of OPEC . Throughout the 1960s , the OPEC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chess over oil , but by 1971 the pawns occupied certain strategic advantages . In the fall of 1973 , they called checkmate . A combination of dramatic price increases and the October 19 , 1973 , announcement by King Faisal of Saudi Arabia of an oil embargo on supplies to the United States threw what had been a fairly orderly international energy system into chaos 18 Within two months , the price of oil had quadrupled . Long lines of automobiles snaked around any U.S. gas station that had supplies . The gluttonous American appetite for oil found the cupboard bare . The decades of cheap oil were over . // The oil embargo ended on March 18 , 1974 , six months after it had begun.19 Within that short period , significant changes occurred . Energy conservation became part of the American lexicon . The Detroit automobile industry commenced designing more fuelefficient vehicles . Americans realized the vulnerability of the nation to foreign influence . The government looked for new sources of oil ? and new sources of energy . THE SUN COMES UP : FUNDS AT LAST Scientists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resurrected wind energy , that relic of the past . Engineers would clothe this ancient , natural energy source in the garb of computers , high-tech materials , and the language of the space age . It would , however , still represent a basic , ancient idea : Harness the wind for the service of man . A new energy prophet proposed to capture the wind on a grand scale . Engineering professor William E. Heronemus had plenty of experience with energy . As a U.S. Navy captain , he assisted in the construction of the first nuclear submarine , the USS Nautilus . When he tired of working for Admiral Hyman Rickover and the navy , he accepted an engineering position at the MIT . Heronemus admired the work of Palmer Putnam and Percy Thomas ? the two pioneers whose work is described earlier ? but he had no burning desire to enter the world of renewable energy . However , becoming aware of the pollution of the Connecticut River and the threat of a nearby nuclear plant , he changed the direction of his research . Heronemus became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy sources . " Need we bother very much at all with fission and fusion if there are alternatives ? " he asked colleagues in the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in 1972 . " Would there be some unacceptable stigma to our society if we were to // opt for an energy system whose science and technology would be very unsophisticated ? " 20 Heronemus described wind energy as an " unsophisticated technology , " but his plans were grandiose . Decrying the views of people such as Chauncey Starr , who argued that little significant potential for wind energy existed in the United States , Heronemus forecast that there would be an array of wind turbine stations ( each with twenty two bladed turbines , fifty feet in diameter , distributed on a 600-foot tower ) in each square mile of a proscribed Great Plains area . This would be equal to " 189,000 Megawatts of nuclear central plant installed capacity . " Such a contribution , he advanced sarcastically , " might properly be called significant . " 21 Presenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the local potential for wind energy : " At the expense of some visual pollution , New England could obtain about 20 percent of her projected 1970 to 2000 generating plant growth in this way " This , he said , was in addition to developing storage of wind-generated electricity , particularly through conversion to hydrogen . Heronemus concluded that " there is a strong case for revived interest in Wind Power . It could be very competitive . . . . It certainly can be the essential ingredient of pollution-free power systems . And it is such a gentle alternative to high temperature combustion , fission and fusion schemes ! " 22 Coming in 1972 , such rhetoric fell on sympathetic ears . As noted above , critics of every stripe were challenging the supposed benefits of a nuclear future and the utility of fossil fuels . Perhaps the environmental benefits of this ancient technology were worth the risk of a little federal research and development money ? Well over $50 billion had been lavished on nuclear energy , but not a farthing had gone into testing the notion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example . Thomas had made an eloquent but unsuccessful plea in 1951 ; now the calls for aid fell on more sympathetic ears . // In 1974 , alternative energy sources , primarily solar , finally had their day ? albeit a cloudy day . President Richard Nixon , facing a growing energy crisis , fell back on coal and nuclear for both shortrange and long-range solutions . In a Message from the President of the United States Concerning Energy Resources , delivered April 18 , 1973 , Nixon predicted that nuclear energy would provide 25 percent of electrical power by 1985 and over 50 percent in the year 2000.23 In his 1974 budget , 73 percent of the research and development funds were allocated to nuclear power . But , in spite of this continuing compulsion to rely on nuclear as savior , Nixon did allow that " solar energy holds great promise as a potentially limitless source of clean energy " He continued : " My new budget triples our solar energy research and development effort to a level of $12 million . " 24 Critics underscored that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renewable energy were paltry ; but a tiny piece of the pie was progress , compared with the old starvation policy . The appropriation swelled immensely with the passage of the Solar Energy Research Act of 1974 . Previously the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) coordinated the limited solar research and development effort . The new act established the Solar Energy Research Institute ( SERI ) to oversee the effort . SERI , located within the Federal Energy Reseatuh and Development Administration ( ERDA ) , was funded relatively lavishly ? $600 million spread over a fiveyear period . Congress empowered SERI to utilize the technical expertise of such agencies as NSF , the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) , the Department of Agriculture , and other agencies . It could capitalize on the resources available through government science and engineering laboratory centers such as Los Alamos and , particularly , the Lewis Research Center , Cleveland , administered by NASA 25 And it could negotiate outside contracts , employing the expertise of private firms , scientific organizations , and educational institutions . // Under this new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $380 million between 1973 and 1988.26 From the outset of this era , large wind turbine development captured the imagination of U.S. engineers and administrators . Over the years , SERI expended from 75 to 80 percent of available funds on developing a wind turbine of from 1MW to 3MW . If successful , it would demonstrate the benefits of economies of scale . Louis Divone , head of the Wind Energy Technology Division of the Department of Energy ( DOE ) , maintained that " costs should come down as the size of the wind machines goes up , " and his team set out to prove that assumption 27 When Representative Richard L. Ottinger , of New York , asked William H. Robbins , manager of the Wind Energy Project Office at NASAs Lewis Center , if the economies of scale really worked , Robbin was quick to respond : " There is no question in our minds that between intermediate and large machines there are definite economies of scale . " He was even specific : " We believe that 200- to 300-foot in diameter machines will produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Lewis Center money filtered out for experimentation and prototypes . Alcoa Corporation teamed with Sandia Laboratories to produce a vertical-axis , Darrieus-type 100kW turbine . Prototypes of this model were set up at Rocky Flats , Denver , and at Bushland , Texas , under the direction of R. Nolan Clark of the Department of Agriculture . Other major companies that engaged in the search for an efficient , reliable multimegawatt wind turbine included Boeing , McDonnell Douglas , HamiltonStandard , Grumman Aerospace , General Electric , and Westinghouse . All these contractors had the scientific expertise to design and build large wind turbines . These companies and the NASA engineers at the Lewis Research Center directed their primary effort to the MOD ( Modification ) program . MOD was devised to build and test a number of large wind turbines . The Lewis Research Center designed the first turbine , // designated MOD 0 ; a 100kW unit erected at NASA 's Plum Brook site near Sandusky , Ohio . It became operational in the autumn of 1975 , but quickly failed . Engineers called the next prototype @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Electric Company built four prototypes , erecting them at Clayton , New Mexico , the island of Culebra , Puerto Rico , Block Island in Rhode Island , and Oahu , Hawaii . The next effort resulted in the MOD 1 , a 2MW ( 2,000kW ) machine , erected by General Electric on a hilltop near Boone , North Carolina . These were so-called first-generation turbines . Researchers designated them as research tools , designed to help them gain knowledge of " operational loads , environments , and . . . different types of utility networks . " 29 In other words , whether or not the early MOD machines worked would not determine the success of the effort . Of course , these machines were highly visible to the public ? a public that did not always understand that inoperative machines could still provide knowledge . Rather , many people saw them as a symbol of the unworkability of wind power . In 1976 , the Boeing Corporation entered the field with the first second-generation machine , the 2.5 MW MOD 2 . The MOD 2 turbine featured an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The teetered rotor consisted of a hinged connection of the blades to the hub . This teetered hinge allowed five degrees of teter relative to the normal plane of rotation . When working properly , this reduced blade loads and the vibration inherent in two-bladed rotors . The pitchable tips controlled both power in high winds and the start and stop cycles . An advanced " soft " gear train also reduced loads and vibration . Moreover , engineers had decreased the weight dramatically . The big news was that NASA executives considered the MOD 2 to be commercially viable , " designed for quantity production . " They predicted a cost-of-energy of less than four cents per kWh when the turbine was located at sites of 14 mph ( annual average ) // wind speed.3 ? Three of these turbines were erected on the Goodnoe Hills , near Goldendale , eastern Washington state ; one appeared in California ; another was erected at Medicine Bow , Wyoming . After MOD 2 came a huge machine from Hamilton Standard ( a subsidiary of United Technologies Corporation ) . The WST-4 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a railroad box car placed on top of a hollow-steel tower 80 meters above the ground . " The WST-4 was erected at Medicine Bow , Wyoming.31 The most recent , and probably the final , DOE and NASA project featured the MOD 5B , a 3.2MW turbine designed by Boeing . // Erected at Kahuku , Hawaii , in early 1987 , it was announced as the largest wind turbine ever constructed 32 The DOE considered all of the turbines to be experimental prototypes ; however , the depart-ment anticipated that the MOD 2 and the MOD 5B would eventually go into commercial production , with a dramatic lowering in cost per unit and , ultimately , providing inexpensive electrical energy via multimegawatt stations33 This hope went unrealized , and chapter 8 offers an analysis of this effort . THE LITTLE GUYS While the DOE allocated 80 percent of its wind-energy related funding to megawatt turbines , in the late 1970s it also encouraged the manufacture of smaller turbines , sized from 2 to 40 kilowatts . On the outskirts of Denver , the Rocky Flats testing site ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small wind turbines . Turbines were tested with the objective of perfecting units for both domestic and foreign markets.34 This SERI project , it was hoped , would provide the " seed money and technological support " to create a new industry . Asses-sing it in the 1990s , one could have looked for a better result . Only one or two of the turbines tested at Rocky Flats have had any impact on today 's wind-energy scene . There has been successful tech-nology , but it came from a different direction ? one that stressed strength and simplicity . While NASA engineers were designing huge turbines , another group was working on a different scale . In some ways this group was out of step with the engineers , or marched to a different drummer . Some were environmentalists , but to characterize them as such is to oversimplify . Some were members of communes . Some simply wanted to go back to the land . Others had no interest in agriculture but wanted to reverse the direction of American technology . Many were idealists , and even more were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuddered at the nation 's growing dependency on foreign oil or dirty coal . Others feared the government and increasing centralization , espousing self-reliance . In Minnesota , the once-revered REA suffered sabotage of its electrical towers from farmer-organized " bolt weevils , " rebels so determined to oppose power transmission and centralization that they were willing to face prison sentences for civil disobedience 35 Others emerged from the antinuclear fight , ready now to embrace renewables . Many recognized that they had a mechanical flare and wanted to work with their hands . They found inspiration not in engineering journals but in the Mother Earth News , Stewart Brand 's Whole Earth Catalog , the Foxfire books , and the words of E. F. Schumacher , the guru of the appropriate technology movement 36 Maine farmer Henry M. Clews combined many of these qualities with practical training . In 1973 , this twenty-eight year old aeronautical engineer left a teaching position to try his hand at farming . His operation being beyond the service area of the Bangor HydroElectric Company , Clews depended on an Australian-manufactured wind generator to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sought technical solutions but disavowed the emerging world of technocracy . One could focus on a number of such " windenergy environmentalists , " and in focusing on two men I hope that they are representative of the many who were caught up in the possibility of actually making a difference.38 Both Paul Gipe and Ty Cashman were dedicated to moving the energy world in innovative directions ? directions that seemed to have been forgotten in the boardrooms of utility companies ; to have been forgotten , indeed , by the bulk of the U.S. populace . Gipe had some training in engineering ; Cashman had none . Both had climbed plenty of towers , installed and repaired machines as windsmiths , and experienced the dizzying heights associated with such work . Each , in his own fashion , can represent the complex , dispersed , unorganized resurrection of the small wind turbines . // Political activism dominated Paul Gipe 's college days in Muncie , Indiana , at Ball State University . He majored in environmental science , but a good deal of his time was spent protesting strip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reclamation bill . President Jerry Ford vetoed the bill , but Gipe felt a sense of satisfaction when President Jimmy Carter resurrected it and signed it into law in 1978 . By that time , Gipe was roaming the coal country of South Dakota , Montana , and Wyoming , working for the Yellowstone-Tongue Areawide Planning Organization , a multicounty body dedicated to evaluating " indirect sources " of water pollution for the Environmental Pmtection Agency ( EPA ) . His task involved locating water-pumping windmills that pierced the aquifer and examining whatever impact there was on the groundwater.39 The Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) had major plans for the Northern Plains ? plans that involved mine-to-mouth coal-fired plants ( generating plants situated near mines , thus minimizing the transportation of coal ) . Gipe did his work , but he did not support this scheme to transform the grasslands into generating stations . He had another agenda . Gipe believed in renewable energy sources and he soon " made a pact to make a difference .. " 40 One possibility he was noticing all around him . Besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? by Jacobs , Wincharger , Paths-Dunn , Sears , Montgomery Wards , Winco . Ranchers had relegated most of the turbines to the junk pile , defering to the high line , but the machines were salvageable for someone with a mechanical flair . With notes he had made while working , letters , telephone calls , and much driving on back roads , Gipe began to acquire wind turbines 41 Later , Gipe would describe this period of his life as particularly exciting because his quest to find and resurrect old windchargers was a pacesetter . Eastern Montana , for Gipe , represented a vast scavenger hunt . Often he followed two-track roads or sometimes set off across country in his truck , traversing hills and arroyos. // If luck was with him , he would find a windcharger that could be salvaged . " It was a wonderful experience , " he later mused . " Being independent , working in that kind of country and doing something that you felt was useful . " 42 Other future leaders within the windenergy field ( e.g. , Don Marier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windmills . When his water-testing job ended , Gipe loaded a tractor trailer with his wind-turbine booty and headed for Pennsylvania . He intended to reconstruct a Jacobs to demonstrate to a local commune // that wind energy could provide the answer to energy self-sufficiency . Soon , however , an Erie , Pennsylvania , businessman found him and paid a handsome cash price for all his stock . At that instant , Gipe became " a wholesaler of junk windmills " However , decent windchargers were becoming more scarce and the market was limited , so Gipe cultivated another talent ? writing . He produced articles for Solar Age Magazine and then , in 1983 , authored a book on the practical aspects of buying or rebuilding , installing , and maintaining small wind turbines 43 This resulted in a job offer in California , where he now lives , writing about and working with renewable energy , the dream as intense as ever . Tyrone Cashman came to wind energy by a different route . Raised in western Wisconsin , he joined the Jesuit order in Oshkosh and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis , Missouri . Cashman thereafter decided that the priesthood was not his calling and , with his **25;1567;TOOLONG bent , entered the Ph.D . program at Columbia University . When he won his doctorate in 1974 , the subject of his dissertation , " Man 's Place in Nature , " was a harbinger of his future . To the dismay of his German-born professor , Cashman renounced a teaching career and chose a different path . As he later recalled , " By the time I came out with my degree I was tired of words . I had beat them to death . " 44 Cashman wanted to approach ecological issues in a practical way and he found his opportunity at the New Alchemy Institute , at Woods Hole , Massachusetts . The institute promoted science that people could use ? that is , small-scale technology that did not damage the ecosystem in which it was placed . At Woods Hole , the mission could best be described as promotion of " homestead technology . " 45 Cashman became involved with wind turbines by chance . A position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he left , Cashman inherited the windmills . He found that , unlike many of his colleagues , he did not fear heights ? in fact , he enjoyed working high above the ground . He realized the impor166 MODERN WIND-ELECTRIC tance of his research following an exchange with Alex Campbell , the premier of the Province of Prince Edward Island . Cashman and others from Woods Hole convinced Campbell that he " could be the engine of the post-industrial revolution " if he promoted wind generation . However , when the premier asked where he could buy a reliable 25kW machine , the New Alchemists replied , " We 're sorry , sir , you ca n't " ? and , in a rash , albeit euphoric , moment , they added that the New Alchemy Institute would invent one . A reliable wind turbine eluded Cashman and his coworkers , but , in the attempt at creating one , Cashman gained knowledge and experience . In 1977 , Cashman moved to a Zen Buddhist farm in Marin County , north of San Franscisco , to work with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening into Muir Beach , he built a colorful , four-bladed sail windmill , based loosely on old Cretan models . In the fall , Sim Van der Ryn , the founder of the Farallones Institute ( an organization devoted to the promotion of intermediate technology ) took an interest in the windmill and Cashman 's work . An architect by training , Van der Ryn held a position at the University of California , Berkeley . He was also state architect in California Governor Jerry Brown 's administration and when Brown created an Office of Appropriate Technology , Van der Ryn became its head 46 Cashman joined the staff as the windenergy expert and , as events unfolded , played a key role in a legislative effort that was to change the history of wind energy ( see chapter 9 ) . Today , Cashman continues to work in the alternative energy field as director of the Solar Energy Institute , located in Mill Valley , California . THE OLD-TIMERS COME BACK Meanwhile , people whose expertise in the wind-energy field dated back much farther than that of Gipe or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fred Bruns , who had installed many Jacobs machines in the 1930s and 1940s , consulted his old records , recalling customers and installation locations of decades earlier , to turn the new generation on to old machines . Most were still up , and some were operating 47 Jacobs himself had moved to Florida and changed his manufacturing interests . But with the surge toward new lifestyles and energy paths , he too , had recognized the opportunity to reenter the business . Jacobs did not restore his old turbines ? leaving that task for others ? nor did he recommence manufacture of the old model ; rather , he designed a more powerful ( 7.5kW ) turbine that he felt was more in keeping with the needs of the 1970s . But this time around , Jacobs suffered from the difficulties of economy of scale : his new product did not realized the efficiency or reliability of the old , basic , trustworthy turbines . By the late 1970s , Jacobs retired from the business for a second time , selling his operation and the Jacobs name to Control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keystone Camera Products Corporation , of New Jersey , to be renamed Earth Energy Systems . The Jacobs wind-energy systems are still produced , available through Wind Turbine Industries , of Prior Lake , Minnesota a9 To people working in renewable energy , Jacobs became both saint and curmudgeon . On the one hand , he was honored for his pioneering efforts . As Cashman put it : " Marcellus was in business when we were in diapers. " 50 Although no longer a manufacturer , Jacobs remained interested in the potential of wind energy . Young idealists admired his accomplishments and hoped to emulate his success ; to them , he was a hero . But to electrical and mechanical engineers who focused on the development of huge , two-bladed machines he was a curmudgeon of the first order ? an older man who constantly questioned their assumptions and bluntly stated that they did n't know what they were doing . " If they were the ones in the moon program , " Jacobs pronounced , " we 'd never have gotten off the ground . " 51 Furthermore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1960 when we closed down our Minneapolis plant and moved to Florida . " 52 Occasionally , Jacobs did more than carp . In 1951 , when Percy Thomas had sought funding for his experimental wind turbine , Jacobs helped kill the bill by writing the chairman of the House Interior and Insular Affairs Committee that they would be well advised to consider a large number of his five-kilowatt machines 53 Jacobs may have been correct in his analysis , but it was unwise to promote his project at the expense of Percy Thomas 's very innovative engineering work . Jacobs 's constantly combative style was evident in his 1983 visit to the Altamont Pass wind farm , sponsored by the fledgling California Wind Energy Association . As visitors stood in awe at the sight of hundreds of large wind turbines , a reporter asked Jacobs about his bemused look . " I 'm smiling at their mistakes , things I threw away 50 years ago , " he said 54 Jacobs 's statement was honest , of course , but the occasion was neither the time nor place for reproach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not wear the mantle of idol well . He was too politically conservative for the role . He eschewed the need for , or wisdom of , any government participation in any phase of the industry . Moreover , he opposed large wind generators not only on engineering grounds but for socio-political reasons , too . " The reason for large turbines is power companies will own them and sell you the power , " said Jacobs . " They do n't want you to own them . " 55 This independent streak prevented his participation in the development of a viable trade association , a move that should have been made in the 1930s , rather than the 1970s . When the American Wind Energy Association was formed , in 1974 , Marcellus Jacobs soon distanced himself . One founder of the association recalled : " We were eager and waiting to honor him for everything he had done . " 56 But Jacobs disdained homage , intent on his separate path as critic . Jacobs possessed mechanical ability and the knack of a // salesman , but a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resurrection . He was committed to competition at a time when the industry could advance only through cooperation . Jacobs remained active at eighty-three years of age , when an automobile accident , in 1985 , abruptly ended his life . There is no denying his huge contribution to wind-power development . He and his brother Joe ? along with Charles Brush ? must be given accolades in the annals of wind energy history . They invented and built unique machines ? machines that worked . In the 1970s , a number of manufacturers tried to emulate the Jacobs Wind Electric Company 's earlier success in manufacturing reliable wind machines . None really succeeded . Small conversion systems , with names such as Northwind , Tumac , and Enertech , made an appearance . Household-name corporations such as Alcoa , Grumman , and McDonnell-Douglas put entries into the windenergy market . As the manufacturers of the large systems had already learned , success would not come easy . The difficulties they now encountered simply magnified the accomplishment of those early , experimental , self-educated , determined pioneers . // THE RIDDLE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago , we would not have problems today . - JAMES SCHMIDT , WIND-ENERGY EXPERT , 1981 NEW TECHNOLOGY IS FRAUGHT WITH FAILURE . ONE MIGHT LOOK AT THE early development of electrical systems , or automobiles , to note that for every step forward there were two backward . Executives , corporate and government , often shielded the public from these unsuccessful efforts . Failure occurred at remote test tracks or in the deep recesses of a laboratory , little noticed and therefore causing a minimum of pressure for the industry and the engineers involved . Some technologies ? and their failures ? are difficult to mask . Wind energy is one . Like the inventors of the experimental airplanes of old , when each attempt to fly provided good journalistic copy , the wind-energy industry did not hide its blemishes . Wind energy did not suffer anything like the rocketry accidents of the 1960s , but many people noticed that the turbines often did not operate when , it seemed , they should . Wind energy was particularly visible because wind routes often coincide with highways . Roads and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment ; for example , winds are strong and reasonably constant in California 's low mountain passes . One expert stated that in the U.S. West " all of the // mountain passes are viable sites : " However , these same passes are traditional trade and transport routes . First , Indians used them , then pioneer wagons , and later came paved highways . In some cases , today , freeways go through the passes . Interstate 10 cuts through the San Gorgonio Pass region : a four-lane road connects the desert with Bakersfield , via Tehachapi Pass , and Interstate 5 winds through the Altamont hills in its descent westward into the San Francisco Bay Area . On each of these major highways , travelers encounter thousands of wind turbines . For many people , assessment of wind energy is based largely on a fleeting observation from an automobile window . In many cases , the experience has not been positive . At the San Gorgonio Pass wind farm area , the Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) and private landowners leased thousands of acres of land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developers purchased reliable machines ; others did not . As one wind-energy developer stated : " A lot of schlocks were getting into the business and selling prototype machines on a mass basis that did n't work . " 2 International Dynergy seemed to fit this description . The company operated two wind-electric generating stations in the San Gorgonio area . The one at Maeva park produced only 12 percent of projected kilowatts in the last quarter of 1985 ; the Cabazon wind park produced virtually nothing . In 1988 , Cabazon was described as " an eyesore of broken and twisted blades just off I-10 about ten miles east of Palm Springs . " ' Hundreds of thousands of travelers based their opinions about wind energy on observation of such sites : that the machines were unreliable and the industry offered nothing but a tax dodge for the wealthy . But it was not just quick-profit artists that made wind energy a questionable venture . In the early 1980s , well-known companies failed miserably in attempts to produce reliable turbines . The failure of the Alcoa 500kW vertical-axis turbine was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edison San Gorgonio 1T2 MODERN WIND-ELECTRIC site , it began to turn on April 3 , 1981 . After only two and one-half hours of running time , a computer mix-up caused a brake failure ; the rotor accelerated to an overspeed of 250 percent , at which time " one of the blades let loose at the bottom bolts , flew out and hit the guy wires , causing the collapse of the whole torque tube . " 4 This catastrophic failure occurred just two days before a windenergy conference , sponsored by the California Energy Commission , was to meet in Palm Springs . Conference leaders had planned to feature the spanking-new Alcoa and its demise caused considerable embarrassment . Alcoa soon announced that it was leaving the wind-turbine business .5 Bendix Corporation tried its hand with a 3MW turbine . The company quickly downgraded the project to 1.2MW when the turbine suffered " unbearable high hydraulic pressure in the fluid drive transmission . " 6 Further catastrophy was experienced by the United Technologies Research Center ( UTRC ) . This company , which specialized in helicopter rotors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Light Company . In November 1980 , both UTRC turbines " suffered a catastrophic failure just ten days after installation . " Early in 1982 , the company announced the termination of its wind-energy program ? Catastrophic seemed to be the adjective of choice in describing many of the experiments and prototypes , although the Wisconsin utility company tested other turbines with disheartening ? not catastrophic ? results . Jacobs , Jay Carter , and Windworks turbines did not suffer total failure . They were , however , subject to " continual stoppages for minor repairs . " 8 The commonsense message was clear : Do n't invest in a wind turbine . In an effort to make small wind turbines more reliable , as mentioned in chapter 7 the federal government began its own testing program in 1976 . At Rocky Flats , near Denver , the DOE Federal Wind Energy Program ( administered by Rockwell International 's Energy Systems Group ) tested some twenty-five commercially // available units . Terry J. Healy , the manager of the testing program , commented that " it is kind of like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not be a continuation of accumulated knowledge but rather a new start ? perhaps like reinventing the wheel . Researchers publicized a few successes , but more frequently they experienced failure . Five years into the program , project leaders made a somewhat upbeat report : " Small wind systems are finally beginning to achieve the potential promised for them . ' " But other assessments , in the same report , were less optimistic . The program involved the installation of forty small systems on the properties of selected users throughout the United States , the units ranging in size from 1.5kW to 40kW . Engineers connected them to local utilities and when thirty-two of the participants responded to a questionnaire , two-thirds of them labeled the performance as " poor . " " Clearly , reliability had not been achieved . Critics of federal boosterism argued that the " government has done the public a great disservice by suggesting that wind energy can be used to generate electricity cheaply . " 12 James Schmidt , a wind-energy expert , asked rhetorically : " We were using wind generators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems with using them today ? " And he answered : " If we had not stopped building them 30 years ago we would not have problems today : " Neither the efforts of private companies nor the infusion of federal dollars could instantaneously overcome the consequences of thirty years of neglect . ASSESSMENT The wind was proving to be a stubborn resource to harvest . No company or individual could build a reliable wind turbine suitable for modern uses , especially one able to run year after year with the vagaries of western weather . Andrew Trenka , manager of the wind systems at Rocky Flats , probably spoke for a whole industry // when he confessed that " we tended to be blinded because windmills had been used for more than 1,000 years . . . . We thought the technology was there and all we had to do was bring it into the 20th century . " " The outright failure of some turbines and the questionable reliability of many others , both small and large , could not be hidden from the public . Individual consumers wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the experiences at Wisconsin Power and Light and Rocky Flats suggested caution . Magazines ( e.g. , Mother Earth News ) advised readers to consider buying a rebuilt Jacobs or Wincharger unit.15 Even wind-energy advocates were cautious . Barry N. Haack advised in a scholarly publication that " on an individual basis , there is no economical advantage to persons installing a small wind electric system under current conditions if there is access to an existing utility network . " 16 Frustrated manufacturers of small machines criticized the federal research effort . Before a congressional committee , Ronald Peterson , board chairman for Grumman Energy Systems , characterized the DOE leadership as " largely sporadic , causing difficulties for us and for Rocky Flats . There has been uncertainty about the budget and operations ? on or off , and how much . " He said the testing program , which called for placement of two systems in each state , made no sense : some states had virtually no wind resource and others had unusually low-energy costs . Benjamin Wolff , executive director of the American Wind Energy Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our members , particularly those not under contract to the Department of Energy , are frustrated by the apparent unwillingness on the part of the DOE to aggressively promote this cost-effective , renewable source of energy , and its apparent inability to shift from research to application . " ' 7 DOE engineers had a different agenda . As mentioned in chapter 7 , the major effort focused on building a large wind generator ? one that would make an impact on the nation 's energy mix . To them , // small wind-energy converters ( SWEC ) represented an interesting but unimportant aspect of the technology . For inspiration they looked to Palmer Putnam , not Marcellus Jacobs . Assessment of the DOE/NASA programs depends on what criteria are used . If we assume that engineers aimed to find out what would not work , it achieved some success . If the goal was to produce a reliable , efficient , large wind turbine , the program failed . In 1983 , one expert reported : " In our recent government testing of what is termed first-generation , commercially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanical failure in the first six months of operation . " 18 It did not help the reputation of wind energy when the experimental unit at Sandusky , Ohio ( MOD 0 ? see chapter 7 ) failed in less than two days , prompting the New York Times to headline its story , " $1 Million for only 30 Hours of Work . " 19 The Boeing MOD 2 , which sat on a hill overlooking the Columbia River in south-central Washington , did not fare much better . In June 1981 , a reporter vividly described how the generator " wrenched its innards . " A bit of dirt had jammed the hydraulic system that controlled the blade-feathering device . The blades accelerated to 29 rpm ? 60 percent over normal speed ? and the electrical generator tore apart . The price tag for repairs was one-half million dollars 20 MEDICINE BOW Perhaps the most instructive experiment with large turbines took place at Medicine Bow , Wyoming ? a town immortalized in literature . In 1885 , novelist Owen Wister visited Wyoming and later featured the cow town in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny High Plains town has not changed much in one hundred years ; nor has the natural environment . Winds still constantly sweep through the town , funneling air eastward from the Great Basin to the Great Plains . In the mid-1970s , representatives of the Bureau // of Reclamation and the DOE arrived , looking for wind . By 1979 , Lawrence Nelson , project manager for the bureau , spelled out his hope that the agency would eventually put up about fifty wind turbines ( representing over 100MW ) that would create " enough power to serve 67,300 homes " and save 800,000 barrels of oil a year.21 The fact that the Bureau of Reclamation ( builders of dams and manipulators of water ) was involved indicated that a hydropower storage concept , often discussed , would be implemented . This network would be tied into the great power-generating dams of the Colorado River , primarily Flaming Gorge and Glen Canyon dams , with " substantial economic benefits and without adverse environmental effects . " 22 During peak wind periods , the electrical energy flowing into the lines could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water to remain in the reservoirs until needed . Essentially , by decreasing water releases for power production , the wind turbines would create an energy-storage system . These two kinetic energy sources could work well in tandem23 The U.S. Congress agreed to try the plan , funding a demonstration project featuring two large turbines : a Boeing MOD 2 ( 2.5MW ) and a Hamilton Standard WTS-4 ( 4MW ) . The two turbines were constructed , raised , and tested , and accepted in 1982 . The scale was impressive , even on the vast Wyoming landscape . The tower for the MOD 2 was 200 feet tall ; the WTS-4 tower soared to 262 feet . Elevators carried operators to the nacelles . The MOD 2 weighed 580,000 pounds and the WTS-4 topped out at 791,000 pounds . With the blades in a vertical position , the MOD 2 reached to 350 feet above ground and the WTS-4 towered to 391 feet 24 For four years , the project generated electricity , but only periodically . Plagued by problems from the start , the Boeing MOD 2 came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a burned-out main bearing 25 When bureau officials received a repair cost estimate of $1.5 million , they quickly terminated the whole experiment . The bureau offered the Boeing for sale , but there were // no takers . In 1987 , a scrap-metal company purchased the unit for $13,000 , dynamited the tower , and hauled it away . The WTS-4 , at the time the largest wind generator ever built , operated for four years . But in August 1986 , a bolt evidently came loose and was ground up inside the generator . The Hamilton Standard was saved from the wrecking ball by the local population , who thought it might function as a tourist attraction . In 1989 , Bill Young , an electrical engineer and fervent believer in wind energy , purchased the $10 million WTS-4 from the bureau for $20,000 . Young formed Medicine Bow Energy , Inc. , repaired the huge machine , and occasionally ran it 26 It was running on January 14 , 1994 , when Young heard a collision that sounded like a " clap of thunder . " Racing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blade spinning in the air one hundred feet above the turbine . The accident occurred when the pitch control failed , throwing off the alignment and causing the blade to strike the tower . The next day , 60mph winds caused the turbine violently to rotate back and forth . The four-ton aluminum platform built around the nacelle fell off and by the end of the day the ground at the base of the tower was littered with broken machinery . Needless to say , the WTS-4 was finished 27 The Medicine Bow experiment underscored a major drawback to the general concept of economy of scale . When a large turbine broke down , often it could not be repaired . If repair was possible , the cost of bringing in a crane ? at approximate rental rate of $10,000 per day ? to lift the nacelle off a two hundred-foot tower was prohibitive . Once the nacelle was earthbound and the repair crew could begin work , the idle crane continued to run up expense . Such high maintenance costs might have been mitigated on a large wind farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an array might have warranted the purchase of a crane . But even with a crane on site , the general operating and maintenance costs would be excessive . This was the conclusion reached by Pacific Gas and Electric Company executives after they erected a MOD 2 in Solano County // near San Francisco . The utility company purchased and operated the Boeing MOD 2 with the idea of testing its reliability . It would indicate the viability ? or otherwise ? of large wind turbines . If the project proved positive , the company would purchase more MOD 2 turbines , possibly creating a 100MW farm ( forty turbines ) . However , major problems developed , including cracks in the low-speed shaft and difficulties in lubricating the bearing supporting the pitchable blade tips . PG &E; lost interest in the project 28 In retrospect , the federal research and development ( R &D); program of the 1970s and early 1980s did little to promote wind energy . Some wind-energy proponents argued that Congress had cut funding at the time it was most needed 29 But responsibility for such dire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced the difficulties of building reliable large turbines . It can be claimed that the federal program enlightened many engineers about the difficulty of successfully building wind turbines . The failure of the first-generation MOD series was not unexpected . They were experimental machines , and only federal research facilities could afford such a large risk . Responding to questions regarding the failure of the MOD 2 and the WTS-4 at Medicine Bow , engineer Bill Young maintained : " When you push the limits of technology and engineering that far that fast , you are bound to have problems . " Both Young and David Spera of the NASA Lewis Laboratory have maintained that although most of the machines did not perform as anticipated , much knowledge was gained . Perhaps it can be said that through such experiments engineers learned what not to do.3 ? The federal R &D; program should not , however , escape criticism . The early failures can be excused . But were the NASA engineers resilient enough ? Were they willing to go in alternative directions ? The evidence suggests a certain rigidity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a design that many questioned 31 Furthermore , they made optimistic pre-
