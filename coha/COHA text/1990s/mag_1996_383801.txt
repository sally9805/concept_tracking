On the base of the cake plate , make vertical gold lines and a dotted border at the bottom . Repeat the pattern on the individual plates , being sure to paint on the underside of the glass . Step 3 : ALLOW the gold to dry for 24 hours . Apply the three remaining colors with a small sponge . Just dab the paint-coated sponge on the inside area of your gold outlines .
