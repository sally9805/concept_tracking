A Portrait of Diversity <p> Often , the regions of the Bureau of Land Management have been perceived in that pinched and stingy way that naturalist Joseph Wood Krutch distrusted : " I am always shocked and a little frightened by those of her professed lovers to whom landscape is the most important thing , and to whom landscape is merely a matter of forms and colors . If they see or are moved by an animal or flower , it is to them merely a matter of pituresque completion and their fellow creatures are no more than decorative details . But without some continuous awareness of the two great realms of the inaminate and the animate there can be no love of nature . . . . " For all their stunning beauty of color , space , and form , then , the brute eloquence of these definitive western landscapes should not be allowed to obscure the presence and equal value of the forms of life contained within them . There is a startling patchwork complexity to be discovered here for those who are willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all living things , " as Krutch put it . On the following pages , we offer a rich sampling of the living treasures the BLM lands embrace and nurture in the cunning saraband of diversity . <p> The Chihuahuan Desert , which spills across central Mexico and Texas and southern ( with one of its tentacles into the southeastern zone ) , is the largest desert in North America . It also the highest , in terms of average elevation , its lowest bajadas and plains in the United States sitting at 1,000 feet , and its scattered mointain ranges running anywhere from 3,500 to 5,000 feet in altitude . Precipitation , particularly in the mountains , can reach as high as twelve inches a year , encouraging the dominance of desert grasslands and various species of yucca and agave  --  the latter perhaps the most " utilitarian " of all desert plants , being used in the making of baskets , ropes , mats , and even sandals ( some species of agave are also used to produce tequila , mescal , and pulque ) . In addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Chihuahuan Desert includes such unlikely plant life as Fendler 's bladderpod , golden prince 's plume and the night-blooming cereus ; such reptiles as the Colorado checkered whiptail lizard , the lyre snake , and the Great Plains skink ; such mammals as the ghost-faced bat , the banner-tailed kangaroo rat , and the fulvous harvest mouse ; and such birdlife as the vermillion flycatcher , the ladder-backed woodpecker , and the burrowing owl . <p> Of all the American deserts , the Sonoran is the richest in/species and sizes and shapes of life because it is subtropical throughout/much of its territory , which includes most of the Baja Peninsula , the north-western coast of Mexico , southern Arizona , and portions of/California in the lower Colorado River valley . The places with the most life are the few surviving riparian areas , of which less than ten percent remain in an essentially natural state . These include portions of Burro and Cienega creeks ( opposite page ) , where yellow and Lucy 's warblers sing out their territorial imprecations , Fremont cottonwoods , Goodding willow trees , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species as round-tail chub still flourish . far the most visible form of life , in this desert , however , is the towering saguaro . Whole forests of this species of cactus stand like soldiers at parade rest amid patches of golden cholla and hedgehog and barrel cactus , interspersed here and there by blue palo verde trees , whip-branched ocotillos , and boojum trees . Woodpeckers hammer into the soft , woody pulp of the saguaro , providing cavities that are home to an astonishing number of creatures  --  including wood rats , owls , purple martins , desert ravens , cactus wrens , and lizards  --  while its upthrust arms offer crooks for the nests of hawks and golden eagles . <p> The Mojave Desert , which embraces much of southern California and part cf Nevada and Arizona , is a place of surprises  --  not the least of which is the fact that such a place can still exist within two or three hours of Greater Los Angeles It is a desert of hazy blue distances and mountain ranges colored in pastels , of dry lakes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of its parts but quite as relentless and demanding as any desert in the world . Still , life springs forth with stubborn variety here , too , fecund and noisy and persistent , featuring tortoises and eagles , sidewinders and leopard frogs , primrose in bloom and Joshua trees in snow , marigolds and pinyon pine , creosote bush  --  always creosote bush  --  pocket mice , swallow-tail butterflies , smoke trees , wolf spiders , geckos and sidewinders , cowbirds , Gambel 's quail , and even the lowly brittlebush , which after the spring rains can become a thing of surprises itself , according to Edward Abbey , who called it " an otherwise humble and obscure knee-high shrub , which can perform wonders : nothing is more striking than to set the grim black cinder cones . . . take on suddenly  --  almost overnight  --  a rash of yellow , when twenty thousand brittlebushes break out in simultaneous golden bloom . Ridiculous . And sublime . " <p> The Great Basin Desert spills over western Utah , southern Idaho , portions of the southeastern corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower eastern slopes of the central Sierra Nevada , most of Nevada , and part of northwestern Arizona country across 80 's transcontinental pilgrims speed unseeingly in air-conditioned vehicles while nearly sublimal images of salt flats and parallel mountain ranges flash by outside . But for those willing to get off the main roads and explore , the Great Basin will reveal unsuspected diversity of life and landscape from the eleven species of sagebrush that can be found on the " steppes " of the Snake River plains of southern Idaho to the bright , pool-table greens of the Owyhee Plateau 's grassland carpets , from the hidden river fountains of the Deep Creek Mountains of western Utah to the bubbling geysers and stinking springs of the Black Rock Desert northwestern Nevada . Much of this country is superb habitat for grazing and browsing animals , including mule deer , desert bighorn , and especially pronghorn . It is raptor country , too , home to peregrine falcons , ferruginous hawks , great horned owls , and golden eagles , while remnants from the Pleistocene Epoch like Walker Lake and pyramid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Sometimes described as a " semi-desert , " the Colorado Plateau country  --  almost all of it confined to southern Utah , although it includes small portion of northeastern Arizona , Southwestern Colorado , and northwestern New Mexico  --  is a puzzle of habitats that defies easy classification . Many of its characteristics  --  including such plants as Great-Basin sagebrush and blackbrush and such animals as the ringtailed cat and the desert wood rat  --  are those of the Great Basin Desert . On the other hand , its average elevation of about 5,000 feet and the presence of mountain ranges as high as 11,000 feet give it an identity all its own ; with pinyon pine and juniper forests being dominant in many areas . A few animals are unique to the region  --  among them the white-tailed prairie dog , the Plateau whiptail lizard , and several subspecies of snakes , including the Mesa Verde night snake . What is indisputable , however is the spectacular diversity of a landscape where eons of sedimentary rocks have been laid dawn , uplifted , folded , wrenched , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carved into intricate slickrock canyons by such rivers as the Green , the Colorado , the Escalante , the San Rafael , and the Dirty Devil . In such a setting , all forms of life are enhanced by a special framework of beauty . <p> Even some of those who are generally familiar with the territory administered by the Bureau of Land Management are surprised to learn that the agency owns a piece of the Northern Rockies  --  nearly 43,000 acres of the Centennial Mountains , an east-west range that straddles the border between Idaho and Montana just west of Yellowstone National Park ( the border here , in fact , marks the Continental Divide ) . Most of Montana 's share of the mountains is managed by the BLM , and nothing could be more greenly different from the wide open deserts with which , the agency is usually identified . It is heavily forested throughout with tree species common to the Northern Rockies  --  Douglas-fir , lodgepole pine , subalpine fir , bigtooth maple , Rocky Mountain maple , and the ubiquitous aspen . Alpine meadows wink with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Slide mountains , among others , rise to picture-postcard peaks as high as 9,000 feet or more . Though rare in the region , " Old Ephraim , " a as the mountain men called the grizzly been sighted from Black bears and more common , as are golden eagles , long-eared and great horned owles , the mountain chickadee , the bushtit golden mantled ground squirrels , yellow-bellied marmots , moose , red foxes , the ever-present coyote , and herds of elk . <p> An even more unlikely site for BLM biodiversity than the Centennials would seem to be the dense tangled ancient forests of the Pacific Northwest . In 1966 , the federal government granted to the Oregon Oregon &; California Railroad Company alternate section of public domain land in southwestern Oregon ; because the railroad company violated the terms of the grant by selling land illegaly , the government took the sections back in 1916 . When the BLM was formed in 1946 , it took over control of these lands , which contain some of the last stands of old-growth Douglas fir and Sitka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left in the lower 48 states  --  a combination of species that has become the focal point of a struggle between conservationists determined to save the ancient forests of the region and a timber industry just as determined to log them . Most of the fight has taken place in the national forests of the region administered by the U. S. Forest Service , but the BLM has its own timber-cutting program , and consequently has come under fire from the environmental community . Much better off is the King Range along the northern California coast , 42 mountainous miles of coastal forest that have been folded into the King Range National Conservation Area and at least administratively protected . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Top : Female bobcat in summer pelage ; right : snow dusts the tops of saguaro in southern Arizona . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : This page , clockwise from top to left : pyrrhuloxia , notch-leaved phacelia , bladder pad in fluorescence , greater road-runner , prickly pear cacktus , zone-tailed hawk . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Opposite page : cactii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : This page , clockwise from top left : Northern flicker , red-tailed hawk , desert bighorn sheep in a stand of saguaro , Mexican beaded lizard , Arizona coral snake , desert rhubarb . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Opposite page , top : Burro Creek Canyon , Arizona ; bottom left : barrel cactus detail ; bottom right : Cienega Creek , Arizona . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : This page , some California scenes-clockwise , from top left : a golden eagle , spring in the East Mojave , evening primrose in the Algodones Dunes , desert primrose in the Kelso Dunes , rare pholisma arenaria in the Granite Mountains , a desert tortoise , brittlebush in flower . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Opposite page : Hoarfrost on Joshua trees near Death Valley . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : This page , clockwise from top left : a carpet of flox on the Snake River Plain of southern Idaho , ferruginous hawk with young , banded rock rattlesnake , Granite Creek in the Deep Creek Mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COLOR ) : Opposite page : Brunneau River on the Owyhee Plateau , southern Idaho . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : This page , clockwise from top left : monkeyflowers in Parunuweap Canyon , a mule deer doe silhoutted near the Colorado River , cliffs in Grand Gulch , prickly pear cactus in the Virgin River canyons , a ringtailed cat along the Colorado River , and a canyon tree frog in Grand Gulch . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Opposite page : paintbrush and cascades , Spanish Valley , Utah . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : This page  --  top fledgling great horned owl ; top right ; golden-mantled ground squirrel ; middle : quaking aspens ; bottom : mountain goats . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Opposite page , top : Icehouse Creek , Centennial Mountains , Idaho ; bottom left : coyote ; bottom right : elk with calves . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : This page : scenes from southern Oregon  --  top left : Siskiyou iris ; top right : typical coastal forest view ; middle : Roosevelt elk near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River Falls . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Opposite page : fog and forest in the King Range of California . <p> SCOTT T.
