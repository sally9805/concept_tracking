It 's a good measure of how the country feels about the Sex Scandal of the Century that Monica Lewinsky can slip in and out of Washington almost unnoticed these days . Ever since she dumped her self-promoting lawyer , who seemed to escort her around town in part to stay in the pictures , she has traveled incognito , and even spent the occasional quiet weekend in New York City . She still puts her telephone through daily workouts , calling her attorneys and advisers around the clock , and she 's taken up knitting to distract herself from the endless talk shows about her case . Last week she went to California to see her father , and by the second day all the excitement over her desperate-to-be-normal vacation gave way to the buzz over Barbra Streisand 's wedding . <P> Give Lewinsky this much : she 's got her story , and she 's sticking with it . By the best accounts , she is willing to testify to some kind of sexual contact between herself and the President , but is either unable or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Big Casino : evidence that the President or his aides did something that amounts to obstruction of justice . Sources close to Lewinsky say there is no indication her attitude on the obstruction issue has softened in recent weeks . That 's the main reason Starr has been unable to reach an immunity deal with Lewinsky 's new lawyers , Plato Cacheris and Jake Stein . It 's one thing to say an archantagonist like Lewinsky 's ex-lawyer Bill Ginsburg could n't cut a deal with Starr ; but if pinstripes like Cacheris and Stein ca n't convince Starr that Lewinsky is offering all she knows , it would seem to put everyone in a very different dilemma . <P> For now , Starr is moving forward without her . Last week he finally brought Lewinsky 's Pentagon confidant , Linda Tripp , before the grand jury to begin to tell what she knows from a year of girl talk with her trusting protege . Prosecutors spent 14 hours questioning Tripp and never even got around to delving into the 20 hours of telephone conversations that Tripp secretly tape-recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her credibility as a witness ; it may also be because the tapes are less than conclusive on the question of obstruction . Late last week Tripp appeared likely to resume her testimony as early as Tuesday , indicating that Lewinsky and her lawyers remain cool to a deal . <P> But just when Starr was tightening the screws , a higher power intervened to take away his screwdriver . Last Wednesday a federal judge threw out a 10-count indictment against Webb Hubbell , charged with tax fraud in April , after Starr failed to get the former First Friend to assist him in the Arkansas phase of his investigation . Starr had leaned on Hubbell , who had already spent time in jail for bilking clients and partners at the Rose Law Firm , to give up anything he may know about Mrs. Clinton 's legal work in questionable Arkansas real estate deals . He was her former law partner . <P> Hubbell held his ground , charging that Starr had overstepped his authority and packed the indictment with information gathered under an immunity deal . In a stinging opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saying Starr was on a " quintessential fishing expedition " and had ignored Hubbell 's right against self-incrimination . Earlier Robertson had accused prosecutors of a " scary " reading of the Constitution .
