<p> Things are crazy in the car business . <p> The 1998 model year has just begun , and the cars and trucks it ushers in stand as a statement of mind-bending changes in everything from how cars are built to how they 're sold . <p> Picture these contradictions , all becoming reality in ' 98 : a rowdy Lexus , a Mercedes truck , a sporty-handling Lincoln Town Car . Contemplate a return to more people and fewer robots on the assembly line . Consider car dealers competing to be nice . <p> " Had you been asleep for two years and just awoke , you 'd have no idea what 's going on , " says Wesley Brown at auto consultant Nextrend . " Lots of rules are being broken this year . " <p> Most remarkably , many prices are coming down , not going up . <p> " I do n't think it 's business as usual any more , " says Susan Jacobs , head of auto consultant Jacobs &; Associates . " We 're entering a period of major change . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break the mold to keep their business . The contrary thinking is showing up in dramatic styling , new pricing strategies , a flood of new models . <p> Consumers get these benefits : Interesting new approaches to transportation ; plenty of choices ; prices that industry analysts expect to stay flat or keep dropping . Too good to be true ? Here 's evidence that even the lower ' 98 prices are n't low enough yet : Chevrolet , GMC , Pontiac , Ford , Mercury , Chrysler , Dodge , Plymouth , Eagle , Toyota and Subaru already offer rebates  --  $ 1,000 is typical  --  on some 1998s , though the model year officially began just Oct. 1 . <p> Analysts see these forces behind the changes : <p> Global competition . " It is challenging automakers to come up with ideas that are really unusual , " says Scott Upham , president of auto consultant Providata . <p> Best examples : <p>  --  Bland brand Plymouth is fielding Prowler , a retro-look street rod for sale now . The $ 39,000 two-seater is meant to resemble a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' 50s and ' 60s . Parent Chrysler plans fewer than 5,000 a year . <p>  --  Luxury-car maker Mercedes-Benz has added a truck to its lineup . The $ 35,000 ML320 sport utility , for sale now , looks different than other sport utilities . To get luxury-car ride and handling , ML320 uses a suspension , called double-wishbone , that would be remarkable on a car , let alone a truck . And ML320 has the double-wishbone setup fore and aft , not just up front as , say , Ford Explorer does . <p> ML320 is built in Alabama  --  a dramatic change for Germanic Mercedes . And the factory there has relatively few robots , relying instead on old-fashioned handwork by highly motivated assembly line workers . <p>  --  Lexus , gone flat on the message of perfection , is selling pizazz . The company 's midlevel GS sedans , $ 35,000 to $ 50,000 , are portrayed in ads as wicked , almost frightening . Styling is jarring ; performance is sudden . And the luxury maker 's first overall brand-image campaign emphasizes being connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . <p>  --  Honda , after years of selling similar Accord sedans in the USA and Japan , bit the bullet and designed a larger ' 98 Accord for North America . To keep from having to rebuild its Ohio Accord factory to handle the bigger model , it carried over key underbody components that still fit the Ohio factory machinery . <p> In other unusual thinking , Honda decided Accord buyers would rather pay about the same as before  --  $ 16,000 to start  --  for a car with more features , instead of paying less for a more cheaply outfitted model . But , to hedge , it did cut the price of the deluxe , V-6-powered version $ 950  --  a move it could afford because it now builds that V-6 and its accompanying transmission in the USA instead of using expensive imported versions . <p> Age . It happens , even to perennially young baby boomers . As that massive population bulge steams into the Buick years of life , it 's casting about for youthful-seeming auto alternatives . <p> Sports cars illustrate perfectly . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atop the wanted list . <p> Porsche , BMW and Mercedes all launched $ 40,000 two-seaters and long waits remain common . Jaguar is offering , finally , a worthy successor to the famous XKE , the $ 65,000 XK8 . Corvette again offers a convertible , starting at $ 45,000 . <p> Mazda is finishing a redesigned Miata . Nissan , which axed its 300ZX , is wrestling with whether , and how , to reintroduce a sports car . <p> And the coupe market seems poised for revival , too . <p> Volvo will be out soon with the unboxy C70 , probably the sexiest model ever from the straight-laced Swedish maker . Mercedes has the CLK . Honda spent extra to design a true Accord coupe for ' 98 , not just a two-door version of the four-door sedan as in the past . After dropping the unsuccessful Cougar , Mercury plans to bring it back as a sexy small coupe , though not as a ' 98 . <p> Leasing . " You can have your two- or three-year affair , then go off and have something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have a permanent monthly payment of $ 350 or whatever , " says Joseph Phillippi , auto analyst at Wall Street firm Lehman Bros . " It contributes to an increasing level of brand infidelity . " He gives himself as an example : " My ( Mazda ) Millennia lease is about up . I like the car , but I do n't want to buy it . Do I want to try a 5-series ( BMW ) ? A Jag ? The ML320 ? I do n't know , but it 'll be something different . " <p> To snare his , and all those other , leasing dollars , an automaker will have to flaunt a pretty interesting package of features , styling , performance and price . <p> Chrysler tackles that challenge with the ' 98 Dodge Durango , a $ 28,000 sport utility . Instead of using a dirt-cheap price to gin up excitement for its latecomer to the sport-utility boom , the plan is to offer lots more for about the same money  --  the Honda approach . Durango gets bigger engines , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> And instead of indulging the natural tendency of designers to use newly designed parts to make Durango unique , project managers insisted on a parts-bin truck . Just 21% of Durango 's parts are unique . The whole front , including what 's under the hood , is swiped straight from the Dakota compact pickup . Taillights come from Chrysler 's minivans . Switches and gadgets are lifted from other Chrysler cars and trucks . <p> And , like Mercedes , Chrysler used an old idea on the manufacturing side . It dedicated a single factory to the model , banking that Durango will succeed . If not , the plant needs a costly remodeling to build some other , more popular vehicle . But if it 's a hit , profit zooms . Designing a factory to build just one vehicle costs a lot less than designing a flexible factory . And it 's more efficient to run a single-model plant than a flexible one . <p> Even more choices are coming . After repeated and emphatic denials it was developing its own sport utility , BMW now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be more like a Subaru Outback than a Mercedes ML320 . And , despite domestic troubles that threaten some companies ' existence , South Korean makers continue to plan for the U.S. market . <p> Kia , fighting bankruptcy at home , continues to roll out more dealerships across the USA . Daewoo plans to sell in the USA next year , and will try to skip dealers altogether . In some regions , it hopes to sell through established retailers such as Sears , and contract with Sears , Pep Boys and others to provide service . <p> Looming over all is overcapacity  --  a worldwide glut of factory space to build cars and trucks  --  and a predicted decline in demand after four years of decent sales and  --  lately  --  record earnings . <p> Wall Streeters see the picture and worry how long car companies can maintain robust profits . Others see a field of tall cotton for buyers . <p> Says Jacobs : " The consumer truly will be king . "
