About 20,000 years ago , a very big animal had a very bad day . Deep in Siberia , an 11-ft. - tall woolly mammoth fell over dead . It became entombed in the permafrost , where it remained until last week , when it was finally freed . If scientists have their way , the same mammoth  --  or rather , its cloned kin  --  could walk again . <P> The elephant-like mammoth was discovered in 1997 by a nine-year-old reindeer hunter prowling for decidedly smaller game . In short order , scientists , led by French explorer Bernard Buigues , flocked to the site . What they saw thrilled them . <P> Mammoths , which vanished some 10,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age , had been found before , but rarely in such good shape . To preserve their find , Buigues and his team dug a trench completely around it , freeing a 26-ton block of ice that contained the carcass . Last Sunday a helicopter lifted the block and flew it to a nearby cave , where the beast will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analyses of hair , bone and teeth suggest that the animal died 20,380 years ago at a comparatively wizened 47 years  --  not bad for an animal that would n't have lived much beyond 60 anyway . Its overall mass indicates it was a male . <P> With tons of soft tissue on ice , geneticists have no shortage of mammoth DNA to play out their fantasy : tweeze a bit of it out , insert it into the ovum of an elephant  --  a close living cousin  --  and implant the embryo in the elephant 's womb . Before long , a woolly bundle should appear . <P> That 's the hope , but it 's a long shot , since even frozen DNA tends to deteriorate over time . " No matter how well preserved old DNA looks , " says biologist Rob DeSalle of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City , " it 's probably not . " <P> Alternatively , scientists may try to harvest frozen sperm  --  provided the mammoth is indeed male  --  and fertilize a female elephant . Close as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be close enough to produce offspring . " Life is n't something you start and stop like a record , " says Ward Wheeler , another biologist at the museum . " It has to go on in continuum . " <P> Even if the beast does n't yield good science , it should yield good TV . The Discovery Channel partly bankrolled the project , and a documentary chronicling the work is scheduled to air March 12 . Daily updates are available at the Discovery website
