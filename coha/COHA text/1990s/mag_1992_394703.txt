Owl Observatory is a 10'x10 ' building located about twenty-five miles east of Great Falls , Montana . I built the observatory to pursue astrophotography in comfort during Montana winters . Its elevated wooden floor prevents animals from nesting under the building and is warmer than concrete during the cold winter months . The roof rolls off and the upper two feet of three walls fold down to give me complete access to the sky for astrophotography . Yet the four-foot rigid walls shield me and my telescope from the wind while I 'm observing . Part one of this series described how I built the telescope pier and building foundation and part two described the construction of the floor , walls , and the bottom timber of the roll-off roof rails . All phases of construction used only hand tools , powered at the observatory site by a borrowed generator . ( Electricity was n't provided by the local power company until I had almost finished the observatory . ) And the total cost of the observatory was only $1,500 . In this last article of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll-off roof rails , prefabricate and install the roof , and add some finishing touches . Let 's start with completing the siding . FINISHING THE SIDING In part two , I described the installation of the 3/8 " hardboard siding over the sheathing on the rigid sections of the walls . However , the fold-down wall sections had only oriented strand board ( OSB ) sheathing applied . First , I installed scrap pieces of OSB sheathing to the corner studs of the east and west fold-down wall sections , overlapping the edge with the previously applied sheathing to form a weatherproof corner . I cut 2 ' ' - long , 4 ' ' - wide sections of the siding to cover the fold-down wall sections , matching the vertical pattern of the siding on the rigid walls . Then I covered the ends of the east and west fold-down wall sections with siding , again overlapping the edges . The corners on the north wall also needed scrap pieces of OSB sheathing applied to the corner studs so siding could be installed flush with that of the fold-down wall sections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ siding . ( You also can use 6d nails . ) With the siding in place , the roll-off roof rails can be installed with the proper overhang . FINISHING THE ROLL-OFF ROOF RAILS The roof rolls toward the north from its closed position on top of the observatory walls to its open position on 2x6 rails elevated by two pairs of posts . These rails have two sections on each side : a 9 ' ' - 9- 1/2 " section attached to the top of the east and west fold-down walls and a 13 ' ' -1 " section that attaches to the 13 ' bottom rail timbers installed in part two of the construction . I used strong softwood ( wood species group II ) for these rails so the casters supporting the roof assembly wo n't wear into the wood . A very hard wood like oak ( species group I ) is n't necessary , but you should avoid soft woods like pine or cedar ( species group IV ) . Ask at your lumberyard which locally available variety of wood best suits the rail . The growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , the crown of the board is on top ) to minimize warpage . Install the fold-down wall sections of the rail first . I overlapped the 2x6s so about 3/4 " hangs over the siding and at the ends . This leaves about 1/2 " overhanging the inside of the wall . The slight asymmetry allows for a flush fit with the 3/4 " - thick corner caps installed later . Be sure that the 2x6 wo n't prevent the top section of the wall from folding down . Then attach the rail to the wall with 3 " screws placed every 12 to 16 inches . The remaining rails go on the bottom rail timbers on the north side of the building . Attach the rails so they line up with the rails on the fold-down wall sections . About 1 " of the rail should extend over the north end of the bottom timber . Use 3 " screws every 12 to 16 inches to fasten the rail but be careful that the screw does n't split the side of the bottom rail . I trimmed out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " pieces of 2x6 so the tops of the wall will be level . The north and south walls repeat the 3/4 " overhang on the east and west walls . The south wall trim required that I remove a 1/2 " X 5-1/2 " section of the south ends of the rails on the east and west walls to accommodate the 2x6 trim . Next I installed two more posts to support the rails and built cross bracing for all four posts . First I braced the two posts already in place . Carriage bolts ( 1/4-20 , 5-1/2 " long ) secure all of the braces . A 9 ' ' -9 " - long 2x4 acts as a collar tie across the top of the posts on their outside ( see photo at top ) . ( Photo omitted ) The cross braces are 12 ' lengths of 2x4 , cut to length after being bolted in place . I put one brace on the inside of the posts and then removed the temporary post bracing installed in part two . A second brace added on the outside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the inside and outside prevents having to cut joints for the braces . The second set of 4x4 posts are 6 ' ' - 7- 7/8 " long and have a 1-1/2 " - deep , 5-1/2 " - long rabbet cut in the top to hold the bottom rail . Bolt the posts in place with a 1/2 " bolt through the post bracket in the footing and 4 " - long , 1/4x20 bolts to the rails . Then you can install the two sets of side braces . These braces are cut from 8 ' lengths of 2x4 . Two of the braces can be cut to length after being bolted in place , but two need to have the bottom end cut before they are installed . The inside and outside braces should go in the same direction as their counterparts on the first set of posts . This keeps two braces from ending on the same inside portion of a post , resulting in a weak connection . A 2x4 collar tie ( 9 ' ' -9 " long ) across the top of the second set of posts finishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished the rails , the roof could go up , because I assembled it in my garage during the winter after I prefabricated the observatory walls . The garage was warm and I could cut the rafters more uniformly than I could at the observatory site . A miter saw makes cutting the ends of the roof rafters easier , but it is n't necessary . All the parts were cut , screw holes predrilled , and the pieces assembled to test their fit . Then I disassembled the roof for transportation to the observatory . I labeled and numbered parts once they were in place to ensure that they would be reassembled in the same positions . Several considerations went into the roof design . The roof pitch must shed snow in the winter . The roof must also be strong enough to resist strong winds and heavy accumulations of snow . And it must be light enough for one person to roll off and on during an observing session . The final design of the roof is simple ( see the illustration above ) . ( Illustration omitted ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the north and south sides of the building by one foot . The eaves on the east and west sides also extend one foot . A rolling frame of 2x4s acts as the ceiling joists and supports for twelve 3 " - diameter , heavy-duty , fixed-wheel casters . Fixed-wheel casters keep the wheels pointing along the rails . With six casters on each side , two or three wheels are always in contact with each rail , so pushing the roof along the rails is easy . King-post supported rafters make the 2x4 structure strong enough to resist wind and snow loads . And corrugated steel roofing , instead of plywood decking covered with shingles , makes the roof light enough that one person can push it . I estimate that my finished roof weighs only about 100 pounds . The seven cross members , or ceiling joists , of the rolling frame are 12 ' lengths of 2x4 . ( Orient the 3-1/2 " side of the boards vertically . ) I spaced the joists 2 ' apart except at the gable ends , where the spacing is 1 ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold the joists in place . The stringers fit in 3/4 " dadoes cut in the ceiling joists . The stringers themselves are not jointed . I first screwed the stringers in place with 3 " screws and then bolted the joists and stringers together with 4-1/2 " - long , 1/4x20 carriage bolts . The bolts hold the frame together while the screws keep the joints from twisting . Fascia boards , made from 12 ' lengths of 2x4 , cap the ends of the joists . I selected a 4/12 slope for my roof because of the potential snow load . This slope means that the peak of the roof stands 24 " higher than the ceiling joists . Given a 6 ' rafter run , which is the distance from the edge of the fascia board to the centerline of the roof , the lengths of the rafters must be slightly more than 6 ' ' -3 " . The rafters need to be supported in two directions . In the horizontal direction , a 2x4 ridgeboard provides a nailing surface for the rafters and keeps them plumb . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roof from collapsing . The king posts strengthen the roof so much that you can use 2x4s instead of 2x6s for the rafters . ( If you do n't employ king posts in your trusses , use 2x6s for the rafters ; 2x4s are still sufficient for the ceiling joists in this case . ) For my 4/12-sloped roof , I used seven king posts that were 1 ' ' - 8- 1/2 " long . To build the roof on the rolling frame , I temporarily supported the 12 ' ' - long ridgeboard with two king posts on the ends . This allowed me to test fit one rafter that I then could use as a template to cut the other rafters . The rafter tail , which is the end by the fascia board , forms an angle of roughly 18.5 degrees while the ridge end has an angle of about 71.5 degrees . ( A rafter square will aid in marking your rafter cuts , but you also can mark the cuts while holding the rafter in place . ) I avoided a complicated bird's-mouth joint . Instead I used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joist . After cutting all 18 rafters to length , I notched them for three 1x4 outriggers . The outriggers keep the rafters from twisting and provide a surface for attaching the corrugated roofing . I marked and cut one rafter to use as a template to mark the outrigger positions on the other rafters . The first outrigger lies about 1 ' from the ridge end of the rafter . ( Be sure it will clear the gussets described below . ) Space the other two outriggers about 2 ' apart . When all the rafters were cut , I assembled seven truss assemblies of one king post and two rafters . There are only seven trusses because the end rafters form a gable and do not have king posts supporting them . I also cut out gusset plates from 1/2 " plywood to strengthen the king-post joints . I used four gussets , two at the bottom , where the king post fastens to the ceiling joist , and two at the top , where the king posts , ridgeboard , and rafters join ( see the illustration on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not glue ) and screws to fasten the gussets to the king posts and rafters ( but no adhesive at the joints with the ridgeboard and ceiling joists ) , because the trusses were n't disassembled for carting to the observatory site . I built the entire roof in my garage , making sure that all joints fit properly . Every screw holding the ridgeboard , rafters , king posts , and outriggers together was fastened , so construction at the observatory would be simply a matter of reassembly . After it was all assembled , I carefully took it apart for transport to the observatory , checking that each part was labeled to ease the roof 's later reassembly . Each part then got a coat of exterior-grade primer . Finally I installed the casters on the outer stringers of the rolling frame . The ceiling joists create six sections  --  and thus six caster locations  --  along the outer stringers . Each section is marked by two holes for the 1/4x20 bolt that fastens the stringer to the joists . I installed a caster halfway between each pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aided in lining up the casters so they all roll in the same direction . With the casters installed , I trucked the roof parts out to the observatory . INSTALLING THE ROOF The rolling frame went back together first . I reassembled on the ground all but the inner stringers of the frame  --  no sense lifting extra weight  --  then lifted it onto the south end of the rails . The south wall temporarily supported one end of the frame while I lifted it . With the frame in place , I screwed a block made from scrap 2x6 onto the end of each rail to prevent the roof from rolling off the rail . The north blocks were beveled toward the end of the rail to shed water . Then I snapped a chalk line just outside the casters to mark the location for pieces of 1 " angle ( see the illustration on the opposite page ) . Thick aluminum angle is sturdy enough and is maintenance free compared to steel angle . The angle acts as a guide for the casters when the roof is pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffice for the fold-down wall sections , while the other rails require 13 ' lengths . I fastened the angles with 1-1/2 " screws every 12 " . With the rolling frame constrained to move along the rails , I installed the roof trusses next . The roof trusses , ridgeboard , and outriggers were merely re-erected according to the labels on each board and truss . After reassembling the roof , I installed hardboard siding an the gable ends and along the eaves , matching the pattern of the siding on the walls below . Use 6d nails or 1-1/2 " screws to fasten the siding . A wooden cove or L-shaped piece of thin , flexible metal fastened along the eaves ( where they meet the hardwood rail ) helps to seal the gap between the roof and building . I added a 1x4 along the bottom edge of the north gable end . This strip helps seal the gap between the roof and wall when the roof is closed . Before installing the corrugated roofing , I covered the fascia board and gable rafters with a drip edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building . You can choose from a wide variety of roofing materials . Steel and aluminum are the most popular and come in many different corrugation designs and factory applied enamel finishes . I chose white to help reflect sunlight during the day . Installing corrugated roofing is easy . Cut the roofing to length with a powered handsaw equipped with a metal cutting blade ( typically this is an abrasive wheel ) . And be sure that you use the proper fasteners for the material you are using . The wrong screws or nails will produce a chemical reaction , weakening the roofing and thereby leading to roof leaks , and panels being torn off by the wind . The screws I used have a neoprene washer near the head , which automatically weatherseals the screw hole . Although you should follow your roofing manufacturer 's instructions , I 'll describe how my roofing panels went in . As I placed each piece of roofing , a piece of weatherstripping went between the fascia board and the roofing . Weatherstripping also went between the roofing and the gable end rafters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place between the overlapping sections of roofing . This strip helps seal the gap between the two pieces of roofing . I placed all the pieces flush with the ridge ends of the rafters and with a 1 " overhang at the fascia board . The first piece overhangs the gable rafter edge by about 1 " and has a corrugation for strength . I filed the end that hangs over the fascia board to remove any sharp edges or burrs . The next piece overlaps the previous piece at a raised corrugation so rain will travel down the corrugation and not into the building . Each corrugation got a fastener at each outrigger and at the fascia board . Winds at my observatory often exceed 25 miles per hour , so I wanted each panel fastened securely to the roof supports . The panels I used were 34 " wide , so each sheet covered about 30 " , accounting for the overlap of the corrugations . Your roofing may cover more or less depending on its width and the corrugation pattern . About 4 " had to be cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 " overhang on the gable end . ( Make this cut next to a corrugation , if possible . ) Capping the roof took place once all the roof panels were installed . I bought a one-piece roof cap painted the same color as my roofing . It too is preformed for strength . I fastened the cap to the ridgeboard with screws and neoprene washers about every 16 " . A space may exist under the cap at the gable ends , but mice and birds ca n't enter the building this way because the roofing extends up to the ridgeboard . Before starting the finishing details of the observatory , I provided a means of securing the roof . I did n't want someone forcing the roof open and gaining access to the observatory or a strong wind blowing the roof off the building . I tried gate hooks but they did n't work very well . Now I use chain tensioners  --  called boomers by some people  --  which are available from many hardware stores . Four large eye bolts in the ceiling joists line up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sections . Hooks in the ends of the tensioners fit in the screw eyes and eye bolts . A turnbuckle and a hinge-and-lever mechanism allow the tensioner to be closed with just the right amount of tension to secure the roof . FINISHING DETAILS With the roof in place , it 's time to add the finishing touches . These details include finishing the floor , adding corner caps , and painting the building . I did n't clad the inside of the walls . That 's a project I may undertake after I enjoy using the observatory for a while . But you may wish to install the interior wall cladding at this time , using gypsum wallboard ( sheetrock ) , paneling , or wood siding . Unless you put in a 1 " - inch thick plywood floor at the start , the floor is really a subfloor and you should install a second layer , or underlayment , of plywood or particle board . The actual type of underlayment depends upon the flooring you decide on . If you wish to paint the floor , a good grade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . Use an underlayment-graded plywood , if you can find it , because voids between its plies have been filled , preventing shoe heels from punching holes in the floor . Fill all joints with an exteriorrated floor-leveling material prior to painting . Otherwise , the joints will harbor dirt and dust that will eventually find their way to your optics . Outdoor carpeting or tile requires a dense particle board underlayment that is 1/2 " to 5/8 " thick . Whether you install plywood or particle board , place a bead of construction adhesive between the subfloor and underlayment and screw ( 2-1/2 " long ) or nail ( 10d ) the underlayment to the floor joists . After finishing the floor underlayment , I installed the door threshold and rehung the door . Weatherstripping around the door prevents dust , rain , and snow from blowing into the building . My door did n't have holes predrilled for the door knob and lock , which was fortunate because I had to cut the bottom off the door . The knob would have ended up too low for normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the floor . Trim around the door opening covered any gaps between the door frame and siding . I used standard brick molding , but you also could use other milled woodwork for the door trim . Avoid casings with a grooved back , because the hollow could trap water that will eventually rot the woodwork . I used 10d finish nails to attach the trim to the studs in the door frame . To further prevent rain from penetrating the corners and damaging the siding , I built caps for the four corners of the building . If your strap hinges do not give you sufficient clearance ( mine swing the fold-down wall sections 1-1/2 " away from the rigid walls ) , you may wish to forego corner caps or use a thin aluminum cap . The caps could be built from 2x4s , but I used 1x3s and 1x4s . Using a 1x3 on one side of the corner and a 1x4 on the other gives a nice square appearance . The tops of the caps fit flush against the roll-off roof rails . The north wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire height of the wall . The south wall caps are more difficult to make because the east and west walls fold down , requiring a joint in the south corners . I made the caps for the south corners in two pieces . The joints on the south side of the corner have a mitered joint , with the angle pointing down . The top of the first piece fits flush with the top plate of the rigid wall , while the inside edge of the second piece fits flush with the bottom plate of the fold-down wall . A butt joint would work for the south side , but mitering the joint helps to shed water . The east and west sides of the corner use simple butt joints since a mitered joint would interfere with the motion of the fold-down wall section . With the roof installed , the door rehung , the floor laid , and a few details like corner caps finished , it was time to paint the observatory . I chose light colors to enable me to see the immovable objects like posts that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A card table and a chair provide the basic furniture needed for my observing runs . To commemorate the completion of construction , my wife Colleen gave me a redwood plaque engraved with the latitude and longitude of the observatory and with the year of construction to hang on the building . But I doubt that my observatory is finished . The building 's design started as an answer to a list of inconveniences I suffered while observing . As my observing needs change , I will probably alter some things and add others . After six years of planning and dreaming about having an observatory , I 'm glad that I built it . No more batteries and inverters to carry so I have power for my telescope 's drive . The walls protect me from moderate winds while I am trying to photograph the skies . And my feet are warmer than they were standing on the ground during the winter . Owl Observatory has fulfilled my dreams . Jim Krick uses his observatory to introduce children to the wonders of the night sky . Parts one and two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p>                     @x In many areas of the United States , schools are struggling to find the best approach to teaching English language learners . As of 2005 there were about 5 million students in the United States that are English language learners ELL , http : //www.ncela.gwu.edu/ expert/faq/081eps.html . <p> Spanish is by far the most common native language of ELLs , at 75 to 80% . Five different Asian languages , Russian , and Arabic are in the top 10 but represent Far fewer students , http : **70;12993;TOOLONG anguagesl.pdF . The number of native Spanish speakers arriving in schools is a strain for teachers who do not understand Spanish and have not been trained in teaching English as a foreign language ( EFL ) . Not surprisingly , academic performance for ELL students lags behind their native English-speaking peers . On one 2007 national assessment , fourth-grade ELLs scored 36 points below native speakers in reading and 25 points below them in math . The gaps among eighth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English , it is impossible to know whether the grades lagged behind due to poor understanding and skills , or because of their limited English proficiency . <p> L : LA LECON DIFICILE What is the best approach for teaching these children ? Should they be taught in English only , or should their education include some Spanish-language support or instruction ? And if so , for how many years ? The answers are not clear , and researchers are still investigating the many variables that make this such a complicated issue , such as age , literacy in the native language , similarity of English to the native language , parents ' English competence , and how these variables contribute to English language learning and overall academic success . <p> There is more controversy than consensus . A recent article in American Educator by Claude Goldenberg ( 2008 ) of Stanford University reviews the findings of two major reports completed in 2006 , both of which seem to say that no one approach fits all . Both reports attempt to find the best , most documentable approach to improving ELLs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NLP ) study cataloged local outcomes For children and youth ages 3-18 around the world and took three years . The Center for Research on Education , Diversity and Excellence ( CREDE ) report searched For empirical research reports on language minority students in the United States from Pre-K to high school and took two years . <p> The key conclusions were few . The most surprising of them is that teaching literacy in the native language tends to enhance literacy and fluency in English . This happens because of the transferability of concepts . For example , understanding nouns in one 's own language makes it easier to understand what nouns are in another language . After 2-3 years of first- and second-language reading instruction , the average student can expect to score 12-15 points higher than the average student who receives only second language reading instruction . All five Spanish-English studies on which the NLP reported found positive effects of bilingual education on students ' reading achievement on various measures of reading in English . <p> Another key conclusion was less surprising-good instruction is good instruction . English language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English or the native language , when goals are clear , context is meaningful , content is rich , and students are engaged . When learning to read , both native and non-native English speakers benefit from having ample opportunities for repetition and use of words , such as hearing stories read aloud and reading about things that were interesting to them . <p> A third key finding was that some of the comprehension strategy instruction that teachers employ to increase reading comprehension among native speakers were ineffective For ELLs . English language learners understood more from simplified text . Unfortunately , the " double whammy " for these students is that they are not only learning English-they are at the same time learning science , math , and social studies in English . Teachers can not and should not , provide simplified text in every subject . <p> Some possible approaches : <p>  --  Reading about unfamiliar content in an unfamiliar language is doubly hard . Reading teachers can seek out text about topics familiar to their ELLs . <p>  --  Teachers can try building vocabulary in a variety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as explaining what they are ( in English ) . <p>  --  Classroom aides or volunteers and peers can provide support in the native language , perhaps using the " preview review " method-translation of key concepts before the lesson starts , followed by review of the new content with the ELL student . <p>  --  Teachers can assess knowledge and language separately to ascertain , for example , whether the child can not recognize rhyming words , or whether she does not know any words in English to make the required rhyme . <p>  --  A longer school day may be required , since the ELL student is learning , in essence , one more subject than the native speakers . <p> Some schools have taken EFL teaching to the next level , making it truly bilingual for both ELLs and native English speakers . This takes language learning to another level , and not all districts have the resources to accomplish it . The opposite argument also applies-that having a large percentage of the population unprepared for skilled work is also very expensive . <p> Another wrinkle is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native Spanish speakers , there are hundreds of native languages among residents of the United States , with different alphabets and writing systems . One advantage to the status qua is that Spanish is relatively similar to English . <p> Teacher Librarian gratefully acknowledges CYFERnet for its permission to reprint this article , which first appeared on its web site at http : //www.cyfernet.org/ **28;13065;TOOLONG .

The research and solutions proposed by this article reproduced here by permission suggests a variety of other approaches including having resources in both the native and the language to be learned .
