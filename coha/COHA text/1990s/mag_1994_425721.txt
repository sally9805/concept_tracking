Section : On the Scene DUBROVNIK <p> ON A WINDY , almost cloudless afternoon in late July I sailed with a group of friends from the island of Kolocep in the Adriatic Sea to Dubrovnik 's new harbor . We were arguing whether the roar from the mainland was thunder or cannon . A mushroom of smoke from a nearby forest fire soon settled the argument . Radovan Karadzic 's Serbs had fired more than fifty projectiles from Serbian-held eastern Hercegovina onto Croatia 's southernmost coastal strip . Dubrovnik itself was spared , but its airport was targeted during the raid and in a series of lesser attacks that continued into late August . <p> It seemed that the shellings were not intended to cause serious material damage . The desired effect was subtler . It was the height of the vacation season , and most of the visitors  --  mainly Croats from Zagreb ( the Croatian capital ) , along with a few daring Czechs and Hungarians  --  quickly left for the safer harbors of the northern Adriatic . Bozidar Vucurevic , Karadzic 's warlord in eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's deputy minister of tourism . This murderous former truck driver  --  famous for stating in 1991 that should Dubrovnik be totally destroyed by Serbian bombing he would build a still more beautiful and " older " city  --  is not just boasting . He really has the power to disrupt nearly everything on Croatia 's southern cul-de-sac . His brethren from the so-called Krajina , the Serbian-occupied inner rim of Croatia , hold equal power over practically every other part of the country . <p> Croatia 's countermeasures consist of a combination of weak saber rattling and somewhat more determined ( though hardly more realistic ) bargaining with the Serbs . The first is the option chosen by Croatia 's hawks  --  verbal warriors with huge rhetorical successes in the controlled media  --  who orchestrated last summer 's marches of Croat refugees . These refugees were expelled by the " Krajina " Serbs under the gaze  --  and frequently thanks to the good offices  --  of the UN forces ( UNPROFOR ) . According to the Vance plan of 1991 , approved by the UN Security Council , UNPROFOR was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disarm the various armies and militias in the " Krajina , " prevent ethnic cleansing , and assure the return of all refugees . The refugee marches , civil protests , and blockades of roads used by UNPROFOR were aimed at reminding the bureaucrats in the glass house on the East River what their forces were supposed to be doing . <p> Various UN mandarins quickly reminded Croatia in turn that UNPROFOR was prepared to leave on demand . Since a UN departure could possibly lead to a renewal of all-out warfare , with uncertain results , the Croatian government blinked . Refugees were shooed away and obliquely told , in the unromantic words of cartoonist Josko Marusic , that they should accept their fate and start " including themselves in certain processes , " such as beginning new lives away from their old homes . Klaus Kinkel , Germany 's foreign minister , underscored the permanence of territorial losses by reassuring Croatian leaders in late August that EU support would not be lacking should Croatia be realistic , effectively renounce Serbian-occupied territories , and live up to European political standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Croatian " realists " would quibble over this last item . They have thought all along that a better deal can be struck with the Serbs . Hrvoje Sarinic , lackluster chief of Croatia 's national-security office , conceded in a mid-August interview that " in order to accept peace and some other solutions , Serbia must get something out of everything that has happened . I am thinking of a small Greater Serbia . ' " But he implied that the territorial sacrifice Croatia would be willing to make in exchange for peace would not include all the land now held by Serbs . <p> Realism , then , means kowtowing to Slobodan Milosevic 's elected red-brown dictatorship in Serbia , with its genocidal policies in Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina . However , one can hardly blame a weak creature like Sarinic for mimicking the policies of most of the concerned powers . Never mind the special pleas of London and Paris , which seem to feel a need to spread a protective wing over the unpleasant regime in Belgrade . Leave aside for the moment the jackal policy of Moscow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special interest in the Balkan region . What of Bill Clinton 's policies ? Despite the verbiage , their essence , too , is appeasement of Milosevic . <p> AFTER HIS inauguration , Clinton went back on his promise to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia . His procrastination reassured the Serbs . His refusal to offer an alternative to the Vance - Owen carve-up of Bosnia fueled the self-defeating territorial war between Bosnian Croats and Muslims in which Croatia squandered the moral assets it had gained in 1991 . Clinton 's most positive contribution was the pressure he brought on Croatia to end this senseless war . It was under the aegis of the U.S.-sponsored Washington agreements of March 1994 that Croats and Muslims agreed on a federal Bosnia-Hercegovina . The federation , however , was described in the same breath as a confederation of Bosnia-Hercegovina and Croatia . Was this a hint to Karadzic 's Serbs to pursue a partition of Bosnia by opting for their own confederal arrangement with Milosevic 's Serbia ? <p> Yes and no . As is frequently the case with Bill Clinton 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after a week of haggling at the U.S. embassy in Vienna , Clinton 's point man , Charles Redman , got Muslims and Croats to agree on a map of Bosnian federation . According to this arrangement , Bosnian Muslims and Croats ( jointly 55.31 per cent of Bosnia 's population ) would control 55 per cent of the land , to be divided into eight cantons ( four Muslim , two Croat , and two joint ) . Bosnian Serbs ( 28.37 per cent of Bosnia 's population ) would be left , whether they joined the federation or not , with control of 42 per cent of the land , located in four separate areas , two of them contiguous with Serbia or Montenegro . The Bosnian capital of Sarajevo would form a separate district with 3 per cent of Bosnia 's territory . In short , the percentages were 58 to 42 against the Serbs . The map had the additional advantage of cutting the Serb supply corridor at Brcko , without which the Serb domination of western Bosnia and th e adjacent areas of Croatia could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account for the 14.15 per cent of Bosnia 's population that declared itself " Yugoslav " in 1991 , but even if all these " Yugoslavs " were covert Serbs ( which was by no means the case ) , they would have raised the Bosnian Serb standing to just 42.52 per cent of the population . <p> On May 13 , the day before the Vienna agreement was signed , Secretary of State Warren Christopher effectively erased everything the U.S. had accomplished in Vienna by accepting , in Geneva , the new plan of the so-called Contact Group ( the U.S. , Britain , France , Germany , Russia ) , which reduced the advantage the Bosnian Croats and Muslims hold over the Bosnian Serbs to 51 - 49 and dangled the possibility of a plebiscite for an Anschluss with Serbia within two years . This is a genuinely bad deal for Bosnia that would partition the country out of existence and reward Serbian atrocities . Fortunately , the unmalleable Karadzic finds it unacceptable , against Milosevic 's better judgment . <p> The disagreement is really over the tactics for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies can not fail in the face of Clinton 's cowardice and Franco-British equivocation , especially since Serbia has Russian support . Milosevic is eager to accept an internationally guaranteed half of Bosnia without any further effort and with the bonus of getting the grueling sanctions against Serbia lifted . After all , Boris Yeltsin and his foreign minister , Andrei Kozyrev , are willing to reward Milosevic merely for voicing disagreement with Karadzic . <p> Bill Clinton has been working on the premise that Milosevic and Karadzic will start behaving better . But a do-nothing policy requires a modicum of cooperation from the other side . Instead , Milosevic and Karadzic have continued to call Clinton 's bluffs . It would be a great surprise should Clinton actually lift the arms embargo on Bosnia by October 15 . There are not a few advisors at his side who will continue to impress him with Kozyrev 's increasingly frequent frowns and the danger of rows with Britain and France . The Balkan crisis is also a crisis of post - Cold War alliances . But the future of liberal democracy depends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BANAC <p> <p> Mr. Banac is a professor of history and master of Pierson College at Yale University . <p>
