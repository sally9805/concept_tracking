<p> Disgruntled voters proved early this month that the term- limits movement is on a roll , but the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments Tuesday in a case that could slow the revolution  --  or fundamentally change the way the country is governed . <p> The lawsuit from Arkansas marks the first high-court test of a crusade to replace career politicians in Congress with updated versions of " Mr. Smith . " Already , 22 states  --  including California  --  have passed federal term-limit measures , seven on November 7 . <p> The results could be dramatic in a city where seniority is power : Major shifts would be likely in the delicate balances between Congress and the president , lobbyists and members of Congress and states with and without term limits . <p> But no one knows for sure that state-imposed term limits are legal . Supporters contend that the U.S. Constitution gives states ample leeway to decide who goes to Washington and for how long . Term-limit opponents , though , say such laws impose a new qualification  --  limited experience  --  on members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Constitution . <p> The few courts that have considered the issue , including the Arkansas Supreme Court , have sided with opponents . And while the nation 's high court has yet to tip its hand , the legal odds seem to be against federal term limits . <p> Some voters find that hard to believe . <p> " People out there get quizzical looks on their faces when I even say we have to defend this law , " said Cleta Mitchell , co-counsel in defense of the Arkansas term-limit measure . " They think , ' We elect them , we should have a chance to decide what the terms should be . ' " <p> Term-limit proponents find justification for the measures in election statistics . Although Republicans overwhelmed Democrats in the last election , the rate of reelection for incumbents who ran was 91 percent for representatives and 92 percent for senators . <p> ADVANTAGES OF INCUMBENCY <p> Paul Jacob , head of the lobbying group U.S. Term Limits , says the rate in almost every election since World War II was similarly high , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staffs and opportunities to do favors for constituents . <p> " Congressmen are like my 3- year-old daughter in the park , " says Jacob . " She does n't want to give up the swing to the next kid , but it 's a better world when we share . " <p> Opponents of term limits call that view simplistic  --  and dangerous . <p> " We already have term limits , and they 're called elections , " says Becky Cain , president of the League of Women Voters of the United States . <p> She contends that artificial term limits would deprive Congress of the power that comes from seasoned incumbents , in effect giving more power to the president . Cain also warns that states without term limits would snap up all the committee chairs and other seniority-based positions in Congress and that only " wealthy and retired " people would have time to be amateur legislators . <p> In any case , Cain says , turnover in Congress is frequent  --  more than half its current members were elected since 1980 and only 18 percent were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they feel shut out of the system , " she concedes . " But there are better ways ( than term limits ) to deal with that concern , things like campaign-finance reform and lobbying reform . " <p> None of these arguments , however , will likely sway the high-court justices . In judging Arkansas ' power to impose federal term limits , they must stick to the law  --  or what little exists in this uncharted area . <p> ARKANSAS MEASURE <p> At issue is an amendment to the state constitution that Arkansas voters passed overwhelmingly in 1992 to limit the terms of state and federal officials . The limits on state officials passed muster in court because they were found to be reasonable regulations of Arkansas ' own officeholders . California 's state term limits  --  contained in Proposition 140  --  were upheld for similar reasons in 1991 . <p> But Arkansas ' federal term- limit measure affects matters addressed specifically by the U.S. Constitution . It bans from the ballot a person who has served three or more terms in the House of Representatives or at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California and 13 other states , the Arkansas law is not a bar to election  --  longtime incumbents can run write-in campaigns . But it is stricter than California 's Proposition 164 , which allows senators and representatives to return to the ballot after spending six years away from Congress . <p> The Arkansas Supreme Court struck it down , saying states have no power to change the qualifications for Congress set forth in the U.S. Constitution . Signaling the issue 's importance , the U.S. Supreme Court accepted the case directly in June , without waiting for lower federal courts to handle it . <p> The case turns on an arcane but crucial question : Is the law a ballot-access restriction like a residency requirement , which has ample legal precedent , or is it an attempt to add to the eligibility qualifications listed in the Constitution ? <p> Oral arguments before the high court on Tuesday may provide a clue to how the justices see it . If , during questioning , they call it a ballot-access restriction , they may be poised to uphold it . But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a qualification for Congress , they will probably strike it down . <p> Legal experts have long assumed that the Constitution sets the only requirements for U.S. senators and representatives  --  minimum age , minimum years as a citizen and residence in the state of election are the big ones . The Supreme Court seemed to agree when it ruled in 1969 that the House could not deny New York 's Adam Clayton Powell Jr . his seat , even though he had allegedly embezzled House funds . <p> Powell met the constitutional requirements , his Harlem constituents had elected him and " the people should choose whom they please to govern them , " wrote Chief Justice Earl Warren . <p> But the court ruled only that the House could not impose membership requirements . What about the states ? <p> " The court ( in Powell ) marshaled the historical and legal precedents showing that neither Congress nor the states can add to the . . . qualifications , " wrote U.S. District Judge William Dwyer of Seattle in striking down Washington 's state term- limits law last February @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Appeals in San Francisco . <p> DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS <p> Still , those " historical and legal precedents "  --  200-year-old debates at the Constitutional Convention , for example  --  can be interpreted in different ways . And as term-limit proponents point out , none of the justices who decided Powell is on the court today . <p> But supporters stress that the Arkansas amendment does not add a qualification for serving in Congress . Like laws requiring House candidates to live in the district they seek to represent , it merely limits who can be on the ballot , they argue . And the Constitution says explicitly that states can regulate the " times , places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives . " <p> Based on that clause , the Supreme Court ruled in 1974 that California could keep independent candidates off the ballot if they had been party members within a year before the last primary . The court said the state 's interests  --  preventing a political party from fielding independent candidates to " bleed " votes from another party , for example  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of voters to vote for them . <p> Term-limit supporters say a state has an even stronger interest in curbing incumbents ' power to dominate elections . They are convinced they have a winning argument . <p> But even if they end up losers in the U.S. Supreme Court , they say their crusade will be far from over . The next step : Pressure Congress to pass a constitutional amendment for approval by three-quarters of the states . <p> " The court is not going to decide whether we get term limits , it 's going to determine how , " said Paul Jacob of U.S. Term Limits . " We can go state-by-state , or we can get a constitutional amendment . Either way works fine . " <p> CONGRESSIONAL TERM LIMITS <p> . <p> Since 1990 , voters in 22 states have passed federal term limits . While seven states bar representatives in Congress from serving more than a few terms , 15 states merely prohibit ther names of longtime incumbents from appearing on the ballot . <p> . <p> No federal term limits <p> N.
