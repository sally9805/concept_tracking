The staff of the nursing home had whipped the old people into a near frenzy . At the far end of the room , someone pounded out a rousing version of " Onward Christian Soldiers " on the upright piano while the two rows of seated octogenarians facing each other warbled and gurgled to the tune , their snowy heads nodding , their slippered feet slapping the floor in time . But the star of the show was Nurse Cumberbatch who had snatched up a cane and was prancing with it , majorette-style , between the rows of chairs . An old man , the only one in the room , set off in hot pursuit of the nurse 's ample bottom , his arm outstretched , heedless of the straps that bound him to the chair . Hopping along steadfastly , he finally made contact with the object of his desire and was rewarded with a teasing smack , first on the hand , then on the lips . <p> The old women loved this , their wizened faces breaking into toothless smiles , their raucous cackles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in confusion . Esther noticed how the mid-afternoon sun streamed in through the windows , how it touched the grizzled heads with light , how laughter was now the music which filled the air . Giving a wistful sigh , she made her way towards her sister . <p> Quietness lay over the room like a fine mist . Pearl 's bed had been positioned at an angle facing the garden on the other side of the sliding glass door so that Esther could only see the side of the bed , the vanity with its bevelled mirrors , the potted plants , the family photographs . There was an acrid smell in the air . <p> " What ! They have n't given you your bath yet and it 's after four ! " As she always did , Esther took Pearl 's face in her hands . There was a brief quickening in the huge dark eyes , otherwise the face was still . More than anyone , Esther could detect differences in Pearl 's expression  --  sometimes it was as serene as the Buddha ; sometimes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on those fearful days , her face wore the contours of a primal scream pitched too high for human ears . Esther kissed her forehead , smooth and dark as bitter chocolate , and set to work . <p> Pearl 's eyes did not follow Esther 's movement as she ranged her equipment on the beside table : brush and comb , hair dressing , hair pins , nail clippers , emery boards , nail varnish . Pearl did not react to this bright display but just gazed out at the bed of purple and white petunias dozing in the slanting sunshine . At last Esther stood ready with a wide-toothed comb in her hand . She loosened the two ineffectual plaits and began to comb Pearl 's dense profusion of black hair . Esther 's rhythmic easing of the comb through the strong , thick mass , her care not to cause pain by tugging at the roots , her systematic parting and clearing of the hair like the felling of a great forest , her applying of oils to the translucent scalp like the anointing of the prophets  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the sunny garden and soon she was staring at the mirror , watching her older sister with eloquent eyes . <p> Esther 's monologue ran on unbroken . <p> " Look ! A few more grey hairs . I thought you 'd never get them . Not like me ... " Esther patted her smooth jet black bob . " Ah ! The wonders of science ! " For a moment , she too looked at the mirror and instead of seeing an immaculate full-bodied woman in her early fifties and her bed-ridden sister , she saw a gawky , raw-boned teenager with " picky " hair , seated on a stool , giving thick braids to a beautiful child with slow black eyes , a ready smile and skin like bitter chocolate . Where did we go , Esther whispered to herself . <p> " Speaking of grey hairs , " she said , smoothing the skirt of her church dress , " even Clairol could n't prevent me from getting some of those last night ... That Azaria ! If things carry on as they 're going , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take much more of this ! " Esther 's voice had lost the brittle cheerfulness of the professional caregiver and had lurched into the husky tones of the confessional . <p> " We had a terrible fight last night , " said Esther . " We 'd just finished the dishes and were talking . You know , no problem . Then she says she 's going out and I ask her where . A session down Number One Shed , she tells me . I tell her to be careful  --  all that loud Reggae music and drugs . But you know her ! " Esther shrugged . " Does n't like to be told anything . So we have words about that . Next thing I know , she drops the bombshell . You know what she told me ! " <p> Esther cleared one side of Pearl 's hair , thinking about the thousands of dollars she and her husband Slim would save if Azaria won the scholarship she had applied for . She thought about how it would feel to tell her friends about her brilliant daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plunged into the darkness of her hair , making ripples as it went . <p> " She told me she 's not going to the interview for the scholarship tomorrow . Just like that ! This is the second interview . There are only two other candidates and she has better grades than them . She 's almost a sure thing . But My Lady is not going . And why not ! " <p> Esther waited , as though for a reply . <p> " Because she 's too full of herself , that 's why . " <p> Esther passed a hand across her forehead , grasped the comb , traced two lines on Pearl 's scalp and , with the intervening hair , began to braid , flat on the head , making it look like a perfect sheaf of grain . As she worked , a single tear escaped her eye , fell into the hair and was woven in . Pearl never felt a thing . <p> " I do n't know what I 'm going to do with her . She 's too rude . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not to mention what she actually said . How I forced her to apply for the scholarship . How she was n't going to sell out the way our generation did . How she would n't take their dirty money if they paid her . On and on she went , running her mouth like a freight train . I just ca n't take the rudeness ! " <p> Esther glanced up at the mirror and saw that Pearl 's eyes had stolen away to the petunias . <p> " Pearl " she whispered . There was no response . <p> Once again she was grateful for this sister , the perfect listener , to whom she could pour out all her troubles , without fear of disturbance or judgement . <p> " You know I had a saucy mouth when I was young . Say the wrong word to me and I 'd go off like a sky rocket . But can you imagine me being rude to Sammy ? I was n't that stupid ... " <p> Esther fell silent as her deft fingers continued to cornrow Pearl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before her , trampling over the carefully-erected barriers of adulthood , exposing her once more to the child-like love and fear of him she had always known . She tried to remember Sammy as he had been before her mother had died . But all she could recall was the man who had visited her waking and nighttime hours with glowing eyes and reeking breath . Even then , she had known he was a broken man , exhausted by mourning his beloved wife who had died in childbirth , broken beneath the yoke of a lifetime 's physical labour , worn out by the struggle not to abandon his two daughters and retreat into the beckoning mouth of a rum bottle . She remembered how she had waited up for him that night over thirty years ago and how he 'd looked , swaying slightly in the doorway . <p> " Deddy , can I ask you something ! " <p> Despite his condition , he 'd turned and looked at her in surprise . Normally , their topics of conversation were restricted to food , clean shirts and swept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the subject of the hour  --  the impending theatre boycott . <p> " I want to go town tomorrow night . " Sammy Dill sat on the rickety chair and peered at her through half-closed eyes . <p> " I know you do n't let me go out but this is different . You know why . The boycott . That 's all we been talkin about at school . Things are really goin to change around here . " Taking his silence as a sign of interest , Esther had continued in a breathless rush . " Why should n't we be able to sit where we like when we go movies ? We 're just as good as them . These whites 've had it their way too long ! Do n't tell me those fellas haven been talkin about it down the docks . " <p> Sammy got up . <p> " Ya not goin ! Ya got to stay home and see to ya sister . " <p> " But Deddy ! " <p> He faced her and filled the room with his drunken menace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mouth had started to twitch , a sign , as Esther knew , of approaching danger . But he turned to go , muttering as he went . " Dat 's what I get sendin you to dat worfless school . Fillin ya head with trash . " <p> Esther was incensed . She had wanted to defend her school . She had wanted to say it was one of the very few things coloured people could call their own . And though Sammy felt a grudging pride in Esther 's achievements there , he feared it would turn her into a dreamer . <p> " But Deddy ! " she pleaded , " I want to be there ! This boycott is important . For you too . " <p> Sammy swung around , his mouth twitching again . <p> " For me ! I 'm out dere in de hot sun , bustin my ass to put food in ya belly and what you come talkin to me about ! Movies ! It 's a lot a talk for children an fools ! Ya sister 's not right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her . So you keep ya tail in dis house or I 'll knock ya teeth out ! " With that he had reeled out of the room . <p> The memory was so vivid that Esther could almost smell Sammy 's toxic breath on her skin . <p> " But we both went , did n't we Pearl , " she said out loud . " On June 15 , we were there ! " She had dragged Pearl through the Back-of-Town 's darkening streets to the Island Theatre , where they had joined the crowd 's attempts to dissuade their less enlightened brethren from entering . The thought of that night with its promise of an altered universe could still move Esther profoundly . That 's why her daughter 's taunts hurt her so much . She had defied her father . She had literally risked her life to be there . The events of that summer of 59 had put an indelible mark on her . But her daughter would not be impressed . <p> Esther 's fingers continued to work mechanically on Pearl 's hair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beat some respect into her . But I vowed I would never do that . And I do n't even think that would 've worked . I never met anyone so hard-headed . " Esther finished the last braid and was just weaving them together at the nape of Pearl 's neck when she was suddenly aware of another presence in the room . <p> " Oh ! You scared me ! " <p> Azaria stood only inches away from her mother , wearing that composed expression chat Esther found so unnerving . <p> " How long you been standing there ! " <p> " Long enough to hear you unload on poor Pearl about your glorious radical past . " <p> Esther did not rise to the bait but instead stared into the mirror and marvelled once again at how much Azaria looked like Pearl . The same fine limbs , the same delicate features , the same huge dark eyes . But there were differences . Azaria had taken the colour of her father 's people , those light-skinned Nelsons , with the " good " hair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Azaria had the unflinching stare of a street tough . Esther looked at her daughter 's eyes and could n't decide what she saw in them  --  stupidity or courage . <p> " So what brings you here ? Should n't you be out burning down Government House or something ? " <p> " I came to see my aunt . Is there anything wrong with that ? " she answered coolly . " And to let you know there 's no hard feelings about last night ... " <p> " Ha ! That 's a good one ! " <p> Azaria gave a sigh . " Whatever I do , it 's always the same . You never show me any respect . " <p> Esther had to laugh . Azaria was actually serious . <p> " Excuse me for being so dense  --  I 'm afraid my education ended at high school  --  but do n't you have this the wrong way around ? Are n't I the one who puts food in your mouth , clothes on your back and books in your hand ! You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Respect is a two-way street . If you give it , you 'll get it . " <p> " Always some smart answer ! " Anger flared in Esther 's face . " And anyway , since when are you so interested in your aunt ? " <p> Azaria did not respond but did a circuit of the bed , glancing for the briefest moment at Pearl , then letting her eyes come to rest on the flowers outside . But it was impossible to still all of that restless energy ; she took to turning and twisting the ring on her right hand . " Let 's not quarrel , Mum . " <p> The words damped Esther down and she looked at her daughter once more : the clean profile , the unruly curls , the slender body , the drab , shapeless clothes camouflaging a surprising fullness of the breasts . She shook her head and turned back to Pearl , whose eyes were soft and attentive . Esther smiled and took Pearl 's hand . <p> " It 's manicure time , sweetheart . What I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shapely . Now what shall we go for today , Montego Blaze or Spicy Red ? What do you think , Azaria ? " The girl 's shoulders moved in a barely visible shrug . " Let 's try Spicy Red . Bright is in this summer . All the girls in the office are wearing reds and yellows . But you look good in any colour , do n't you , Pearl ? When he was sober , Sammy used to call you his Demerara Brown . Yes , you can wear ... " <p> " Is there anything I can do to help ? " Azaria interrupted , with an edge in her voice . " I mean with Aunt Pearl . Does she need a drink or is it time for her to be fed ? " Azaria was pacing about the room , twisting the ring viciously . <p> " It 's too early for that . But if you want to make yourself useful , go to the Nurse 's Station and bring me some cotton wool so I can take this old polish off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Esther after her daughter had left . " It 's written all over her . And maybe she 's right . When I 'm around her , I 'm always walking on eggs . Pearlie , having a child today is no joke . I can never relax with her . She takes all my time ! " <p> That old-fashioned phrase hurled Esther down a tunnel of time which opened out once again in the year 1959 , in a classroom , with her History teacher , Mr. Smith . <p> " You people take all my time , " he used to say . " Especially you , Esther Dill . Always wanting to know why . " <p> And then he 'd smile that broad , heart-stopping smile and Esther and her friends would thank the Fates for sending them such a man . The word " teacher " was woefully inadequate in describing what Stephen Smith was to the Fifth Form class . This son of the soil had recently graduated from Wilberforce and had returned home bringing tidings from other worlds which broke through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of W.E.B . Du Bois , Marcus Garvey , Rosa Parks , Kwame Nkrumah . With Stephen Smith , History was the shattering of the glass in which Clive of India and the imperial banditry beheld themselves . The more Stephen Smith gave to his students , the more they hungered for what he gave , the more they turned their eyes on the piece of rock beneath their feet and made it tremble with their questions . <p> He had told them that the winds of change were blowing over the entire planet , including each and every one of his students . He had said to Esther that a way would be found to persuade her father to allow her to stay in school so that she could eventually o away to college . This idea was so alien yet so thrilling that it kept her awake at night and would always be her first thought when she opened her eyes in the morning . College was for others , not for people like her . But Stephen Smith had made her believe that this was a new day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spring of ' 59 , the first leaflets had appeared , signed by an anonymous band called " A Progressive Group " and when the leaflets had called for a boycott of segregated theatres in a segregated land , his students had surrounded him and said , " You 're one of them , are n't you ? Are n't you , sir ? " He 'd neither confirmed nor denied , had only given them an enigmatic smile which lifted their throbbing hearts . <p> " On the threshold of a dream , " thought Esther . " That 's where we were ... " <p> Footsteps behind her failed to rouse Esther from the trance into which she had slipped . Even Azaria 's words could not pull her back into the present . <p> " Here it is , Mum . " <p> As she reached for the cotton wool in Azaria 's hand , she searched her daughter 's face for something in it that would rekindle the hope of those heady days so long ago . Nothing . " You O.K. ? " Azaria 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of concern in her dark brown eyes . <p> " Of course , of course . " Esther took the cotton wool and started on Pearl 's nails . Pearl 's eyes lay flat and unseeing on the flowers outside . Esther swabbed the nails with the pungent cotton wool and tossed the red-stained debris into the bin . At the sliding door , aria tugged at a thread from the bottom of the wrinkled grey-green shirt that enveloped her . <p> Esther glanced up , saw Azaria 's fiddling and before she could stop herself , said , " I wish you would wear some decent clothes . You look like a ... " <p> " Like a what ? " <p> " Nothing . Forget it . " <p> " No ! Say it . Tell me what you think I look like ! " Azaria 's eyes were bright , her body very still as she concentrated on meeting her mother 's challenge . <p> Esther remembered when she had first gone to New York . and had boarded the express train instead of the local . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on until the end of the line . She felt like that now . <p> " All right . You want to know ? " Esther asked , looking at Pearl rather than Azaria . " You think I 'm going to say you look like a tramp , a female Tommy Tucker ? Well you do n't . But you do look like someone who takes no pride in herself , who does n't care how she looks and what other people think . You look like that and sometimes when I 'm in town with you , it makes me feel ... " <p> " Ashamed ? At last we 're getting somewhere . " Azaria 's words threw off an intense heat , which sent trembling waves of light bouncing from the glass door against which she now pressed herself , as though anxious to join the sleepy flowers on the other side . <p> " What you want is for me to look like a nineteen-year-old version of you . Colour co-ordinated down to my underwear , face painted in Spicy Red and the hairs on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look like me . I just wish you looked like you 'd had a bath . " Esther reined herself in and tried to sound mild . <p> Azaria moved away from the door and approached the bed . Her mother 's head was bent over Pearl 's hand which she was holding as though it were a life raft on a stormy sea . <p> " In this island , you have to look the part , like you 've just stepped out of a magazine . And if you do n't , they think you 're on coke , " snorted Azaria . She towered over Esther , who sat there holding Pearl 's hand , ducking beneath the flailing whip of Azaria 's words . <p> " But I 'm telling you this once and for all , Mum , I 'm not living up to anyone 's stereotype ! " <p> On hearing this familiar tirade , Esther 's heart regained some sense of equilibrium and she was able to say , without looking up , " Good thing the College is so cheap . Otherwise I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping that this would be the end of it . <p> " You see , you wo n't take me seriously . " " Why should I ? You 're serious enough for all of us . Sometimes I think you were born old . " <p> Esther addressed Pearl 's extended hand . " One thing we can say , Pearlie . At least we can say we were young once . We know what it means Co be young . " <p> " Stop talking to Pearl , Mum . Why do n't you talk to me for once ! " Azaria 's flashing eyes raked over the unmoving figure in the bed . " I do n't know how to make you understand . I can not and will not be that person you want me to be . I wo n't do it ! And I wo n't go to the Somers Isle Bank tomorrow and beg them for their money . I will not soil my hands with it . " <p> Esther placed her sister 's hand on the bed and looked straight at Azaria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving her daughter time to understand that it was now her turn to crack the whip . As she fixed Azaria with an unwavering gaze , she recalled the day a few months ago when she had been handed the application form from the Somers Isle Bank . Although she had been a customer for many years , it was the first time she had felt any real connection between herself and her country 's ultimate source of power . As she clutched the form , her fingers had burned from the intimate touch of prestige , influence and wealth . The burning was not pain but pleasure , one that she wished to give to her daughter . <p> " Azaria , why do n't you grow up ? All that so-called ' dirty ' money can make life easier for me and your dad . You think university is cheap And  --  and  --  " Esther 's index finger jabbed the dangerous space which separated her from her daughter . " Instead of getting a degree from a place no-one has ever heard of , you could have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Like it 's a bag of sugar ! Education happens up here , Mum , " she said tapping her head . " It ca n't be bought . " <p> Esther ignored every single syllable Azaria had uttered . <p> " With that under your belt , you would n't have to take orders from anybody . You could beat them at their own game . " <p> " That 's just it . I do n't want to play their game . As long as you play their game , they win . " <p> The air in the space between them was getting heavy , weighed down by the burden of the years . <p> " Keep talking ! You youngsters make me laugh , always inventing the wheel . You do n't want to believe this but thirty years ago when I was your age , they thought I was a hot head . I was there , you know . Because of us , they desegregated the theatres ... " Esther paused momentarily and grimaced , seeing the impenetrable look on Azaria 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurants and hotels . And every other thing that had a ' Whites Only ' sign . You would n't know ... this place was like Mississippi ! And we changed it . " <p> While Esther was speaking , Azaria examined her scruffy white sneakers and socks . Despite evidence to the contrary , she was listening . <p> " Mum , I know all that . You 've told me a thousand times . But what I 'm saying is ... " Azaria gave the leg of the chair an impatient little kick . " It has n't changed . The people who owned the Island Theatre back then are the same ones running the Somers Isle Bank today . What they gave away with one hand , they took back with the other . Nothing 's really changed from those days . " <p> " That 's just not true , " said Esther , with a deep sigh . " You have to use everything you can , including the Somers Isle Bank , to get where you want to go . There 's no other way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pearl 's bed with a disconsolate air . " So what are you going to do , phone up tomorrow and say you wo n't be coming ? " <p> " No , I just wo n't show . " <p> " What ! Did you hear that , Pearl ? " Esther exploded , looking from one pair of huge dark eyes to the other . " They 'll not only think you 're a fool but have no home training either ! " <p> Azaria 's face broke into a smile . <p> " Oh God ! " Esther continued . " What 's wrong with you ? Do you know what they 'll do ? Your name will go down in a book ! " <p> Even with her hand over her mouth , Azaria 's laughter escaped at the thought of her name being inscribed in the Book of Deeds . <p> " You laugh ! I 've worked in Government long enough to know that these things are real ! " <p> Esther glared at her but was greeted with nothing but infuriating smiles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " They 'll say : ' Azaria Nelson : bright , very bright , but we hear she 's a bit into this Black thing ... ' Your name will go down . " The gravity of her own prediction struck Esther with a sudden and awesome intensity . She crossed her arms around her waist and , without knowing it , started to rock to and fro . <p> The smile vanished from Azaria 's face as she felt herself drawn into the vortex sucking in her mother 's spirit . <p> " I do n't care what they think , Mum . I just do n't care . " " But you should care ! People like those have your life in their hands . " <p> " The only hands holding my life are these , " and she stretched her long olive fingers wide , with the uncompromising assurance of the very young . <p> Esther looked at her daughter 's hands , remembering them as they were as she first saw them , just as they were when Azaria was born , wrinkled , white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny nail . She could see the ring on Azaria 's hand , the ring with the luminous black stone , that had belonged to her mother whom she hardly remembered . She had died giving birth to Pearl . Esther saw Azaria 's hands and struggled o fix in her mind the stranger who owned them . <p> All of a sudden , there was a slight movement in the bed and Esther noticed that Pearl was clutching the sheets . Her mouth was twisted and her eyes were clouded by a look of fear . She turned on Azaria , rage leaping from her black eyes . <p> " Now look what you 've done , " said Esther , her voice harsh and loud . " You 've gone and upset your aunt . " <p> " Oh sure , everything 's always my fault , " Azaria growled . <p> " Selfish ! " Esther retorted . " Always have been . It 's all right for you to rant and rave and abuse me . I 'm used to it . But I forbid you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shake violently . <p> " Pearl ! Precious Pearl ! " she cried . " That 's all I 've heard my entire life . She 's an obsession with you  --  precious Pearl and the sacred year 1959 ! " Azaria made a gigantic sign of the cross and pressed her palms together . " Everybody has to take a back seat . Look at Daddy ! " <p> Even in the midst of her anger , the mere mention of her husband Slim had a calming effect on Esther . Although seen by many as one of life 's doormats , to Esther he was the glue that kept her life together . A man with feet firmly planted on the good earth who provided the perfect foil for Esther 's nights into heaven or the abyss . <p> " Sometimes I wonder if I have a father . " Words new from Azaria 's lips at great speed . " He clocks in for meals and sleep . The rest of the time he 's out driving taxi . Working , working . Anything to et out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I call it a decent man . " Esther 's voice was low and ominous . <p> " I call it a dead man ! " came Azaria 's reply .

Why do I always have to play second fiddle to-to-her ? " And her finger was a grotesque spear that she aimed at Pearl . <p> " What kills me is the way you talk to her , like if she understands . " <p> Azaria saw her mother begin to rise from the chair but she too was on the express train hurtling through the terrors of the naked city . " You see that limestone wall out there " Azaria pointed out to the garden . " You 'll get as much understanding from that as you do from her .

But she did feel the shivering air in the dangerous space that separated them and the thunder of blood as it raced down her face to where the stunning blow had landed . Azaria crumpled where she stood . Esther sobbed as though a fountain had burst from her . <p> The door of Pearl 's room was flung open . Nurse Cumberbatch , looking startled and unsure , took one step forward . " What the hell 's going on here ? " <p> As her eyes swept over the scene , the nurse became transformed and threatening , no longer the figure of fun in the Day Room . Her eyes bulged , her hands were planted on her spreading hips and her large breasts seemed to be trained on the combatants like twin cannons . <p> " I said , what the hell 's going on ? " <p> Clutching the side of her face , Azaria stumbled past the nurse out of the room . <p> Hunched over , weeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But she could not bring herself to look at her sister . Nor could she block out the whimpering sound that bore into the centre of her brain . <p> " It 's all right , darling . Do n't upset yourself , " the nurse said to Pearl . With a sudden hardening of her voice , she spoke to Esther . " I think you 'd better leave . I 'm going to have to report this . " <p> Esther opened the sliding glass door and looked at her sister . Pearl 's eyes were aghast , her mouth broken , her body coiled up like a corkscrew . The way she 'd looked that June night so long ago . <p> Esther 's tears blinded her as she staggered across the garden , leaving , as she went , a trail of crushed blossoms , purple and mauve and white . She half walked , half ran , only dimly aware that she was leaving the Nursing Home behind . At last she stopped and looked about her . The graceful old building was no longer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She heard the lapping of water against rock . She headed towards the source of that sound and soon was sitting on the grey-brown sun-warmed rock , made smooth by wind and tide and the slowly turning wheel of time . She felt the heat from the limestone radiate through her flesh into the very marrow of her bones . She heard the music of the shore and it was a blessing to her spirit . And although her eyes were closed , through her eyelids she could see the scarlet outline of the sun as it began its descent into the western ocean . She sat motionless , fused to the rock , adrift on the breath of the late afternoon . <p> The sound of approaching footsteps made a gradual impression on Esther 's mind . She continued to watch the setting sun work its magic . <p> " Mum ? " <p> Esther turned with regret from the peaceful horizon and looked at her daughter . <p> Azaria 's eyes were red and swollen , her step hesitant . Her face was tear-stained , pale , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her left cheek bore the distinct outline of her mother 's hand . Her eyes could not seem to focus on any one thing . She seemed completely lost . <p> Esther wished only to resume her contemplation of the sunset and the sea but was moved to pity at the sight of Azaria so helpless and confused . <p> " Come , " said Esther , beckoning and patting the brown-grey rock . " Sit down here beside me . " <p> Azaria lowered herself down next to her mother , gingerly , as though every sinew of her body pulsated with a dull ache . They sat in silence , neither looking at nor touching one another . <p> " I 'm sorry , " mumbled the girl . " I did n't mean ... " <p> Esther placed her fingers against Azaria 's trembling lips . " Do n't ! " she said and gently touched the scarlet left cheek . " Whatever happened back there was my fault Has always been my fault . " <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> " They stole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me now and it 's all my fault . " <p> " You 're not making any sense , Mummy . Tell me what you mean ! " <p> Esther 's glassy eyes slid over Azaria . Her voice was flat and dead as she began to lift the veil that had enthralled her daughter 's life from the day she was born . <p> Azaria had been so right when she had said that the events of the summer of 1959 were an obsession . Historians now said that boycott signalled the awakening of a people 's consciousness . For Esther , it was about being young and daring to rattle the bars of her personal prison . She had managed to outsmart her father for eight straight nights . She and Pearl would slip into town , join the crowds outside the Island Theatre and Playhouse and be back home before Sammy returned from drinking with the boys . <p> " In some ways , it was the happiest time of my life , " said Esther . <p> " The summer of ' 59 ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A small smile played about her lips . " I felt so alive ! The banners , the crowds , the speeches . Once I even got up on a box and said a few words ! " <p> Then the Bermuda General Theatres shut down all operations , Esther recounted . The boycott was hotly debated in Parliament and in the press . <p> " When they closed down the theatres , we could smell victory and it smelled sweet , " Esther continued , bringing her hand to her breast , holding on to the memory . <p> Within a week , the big hotels and restaurants desegregated and a few days after that , the theatres re-opened . <p> " Now we could sit where we liked . They could n't spit down on us from the balcony any more . We were n't shadows any more . But , " and she waved her hand in a limp , defeated gesture , " it came too late for me , for us . " <p> Azaria received her mother 's words like a pilgrim , weary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partially open . <p> " I understand about the boycott , Mum , " she said . " But there must be something more ! " Azaria could not fathom the tides of emotion washing over her mother 's face . <p> " They stole her from me . " <p> " Mum ! You 're driving me crazy . Will you tell me what this had to do with Pearl ? " Her words vibrated with bewilderment and , despite herself , a creeping irritation . <p> Esther lanced about her as though noticing her surroundings for the first time . The little point of straggling crab grass and rock was littered with bits of rubbish , a discarded fishing net , some rusty hooks . In a land of pristine beauty , it was a dishevelled backwater , tucked away , as if not to offend the fastidious eyes of the tourists . Esther felt a sudden affection for this place ; it was rugged , ragged , exposed , beaten but not quite destroyed . <p> " We never knew who did it . No-one was ever brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Some people said it was a sailor . It could have been more than one  --  we 'll never know . " Esther seemed frozen where she sat , the soft sea breeze unable to stir the light material of her dress , or lift a single strand of her hair . <p> " Pearl could n't tell us , would n't tell us , did n't want to tell us another thing after that night . " Esther 's voice had dropped so low that the brushing of wave against stone all but drowned what she was saying . Azaria leaned closer , silence enfolding her like a robe . <p> " It was the one night that Pearl did n't come to town with me , " Esther whispered . " Island and Playhouse had already closed down and we knew we were going to win . We were strong . We were celebrating already . We had this motorcade that drove all the way down to St. George 's . " Esther clasped her hands together . <p> " I had n't been in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile briefly lighting her face . " I thought I was in heaven , sitting there next to Mr. Stephen Smith , feeling different about myself , about the world . " <p> " Stephen Smith , that was your teacher , right ? " Esther nodded . For a moment she seemed incapable of another word . She took a deep breath . <p> " It was a magical night . I felt for the first time that the whole sky belonged to me . " Esther pressed her lips into a hard , tight line . " What I did n't realise was while I was out enjoying myself in the name of the people , the person I was really responsible for was having her life taken away from her . " <p> Azaria 's eyes widened as she watched her mother bow her head . <p> " When I got home , I found Pearl beaten and raped . She went away from me that night and she never came back . " Esther paused . " All these years I 've been trying to bring her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing Azaria could say . Tears rolled down her cheeks , over the spot bearing the imprint of her mother 's hand . The dark blue evening waters rubbed themselves against the rocks , sighing in an endless rhythm . <p> " She never talked much , you know . She was slow , could n't learn much . But after that night she decided there was nothing she wanted to learn or talk about . And little by little , she 's drawn into herself . Now all that 's left is a person in a bed . In a place where people come to die . " <p> " Oh my God ! Why did n't you tell me before . " Esther appeared not to hear . " The part that hurts most , " she said . " is that she was looking for me when it happened . Wandered out in the dark , looking for me . Sammy found her not too far from the house . " Esther heaved herself up and dusted off her dress . She looked down at Azaria 's shock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beautiful black forest of Pearl 's hair and made it into a work of art . <p> It was Azaria 's turn to get to her feet . The sun was stretching its arms out over the earth and sea in farewell . Azaria looked into the sun 's golden eye before it slipped behind the waves . When she faced her mother , there was still the questioning look but there was something different about her . <p> " So all these years you 've been blaming yourself ... " The muscles in Azaria 's face worked as she strove to find the right words . " But you 've got to stop , Mum . It was n't your fault . You love Pearl ! You 've loved her all her life . " Azaria paused , trying to get her mother to look at her . <p> " If you 're to blame , so was Sammy , the neighbours . Not to mention that animal who did it . Mum , everyone has to take the blame , not just you ! " <p> " Azaria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I know you 're trying to make me feel better . " The dark hollows beneath Esther 's eyes seemed to fill with unshed tears . " But nothing you say can convince me of that . It was my job to look after Pearl and I failed . " Esther 's voice had lost its tremor and was now matter-of-fact . " Why ! Because I was out having fun , trying to save the world . So after that I said , Let someone else go out there and get involved . I did and look what happened . Pearl paid the price . " Esther turned to go . " I decided to just look after my own . " <p> " You know what , " said Azaria as they started to walk slowly back . " Pearl 's not the only one . We 've all paid ; you , Daddy , me . All of us . " They walked along together in the fading light . <p> " Mum , what ever happened to Stephen Smith ? " <p> " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and never came back . " <p> Azaria frowned and shook her head but her mother did not see . As they walked away in the gathering twilight , Azaria put a protective arm around Esther 's shoulder . <p> The sun rose the next morning , like a young girl flaunting her beauty . At ten o'clock precisely , Azaria entered the Board Room of the Somers Isle Bank . Quiet opulence furnished the room with its Chinese carpets , heavy bronze fittings , its oil paintings , and polished cherry oak table . Seated behind this was a panel of six smiling men . There was an air of celebration as the men surveyed their prize . In her white linen and with her hair swept back , Azaria perfectly fitted the profile : she was bright , hungry and black . Just right . Her choice as recipient of the major award would go down well in the community . It was people such as her that they wanted in their corporate pocket . <p> " Wo n't you sit down , Miss Nelson ? " <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and answers moving back and forth like the motion of the tides . It was so painless that Azaria found her thoughts slipping away to the Nursing Home and the ragged point of rock that jutted into the sea . When all was done , the chairman of the panel smiled and said , " Is there anything you wish to ask us ? " <p> Azaria took a typewritten sheet out of her bag . <p> " Yes . But it is not so much a question as a statement of intent . " As she cleared her throat , the panel members exchanged quick glances . Holding the sheet with a steady hand , Azaria began to read . <p> " Inasmuch as the Somers Isle Bank is an inherently racist institution ... " The faces of all six members of the panel froze into a single look of astonishment , eyebrows raised , eyes wide , mouths gaping . <p> " And inasmuch as it has a sustained history of commitment to the prolongation of institutionalised racism in our country ... " The founding fathers of the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glowered with impotence , enraged that they could not come down from the wall and put a stop to this . <p> " And inasmuch as the selfsame bank has long-standing links with the racist apartheid regime of South Africa ... " In an almost imperceptible movement , five of the panel members turned towards the chairman , handing him the responsibility . As Azaria 's voice rang out clear and strong , the chairman lowered his eyes . " And inasmuch as the aforementioned organization provides facilities for the laundering of monies made from the proliferation of illegal drugs which oppress our people ... " Azaria 's words were like the storm surge during a hurricane , threatening to overwhelm the land with its mighty waters . Yet somewhere in her mind , in a quiet space in the midst of the tumult , Azaria gazed into a smooth black stone , ancient , powerful , which spoke to her in ancestral voices . <p> " All these things being equal , I , Azaria Nelson , hereby withdraw my candidature from the Sir Charles Langton Award . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence . Just as she was about to put the paper in her bag , the chairman of the panel leaned towards her . <p> " May I see that ? " <p> Azaria stood up briskly . <p> " Certainly not ! " she said from the doorway . <p> The interview was over . <p> Azaria rushed past the secretaries , jumped into the elevator and ran across the main banking hall . Everything was a blur . It was n't until she was out in the hot sunshine of the street that she became aware of the loud thumping in her chest and the shivering that had taken hold of her . In a few moments , though , the heat of the sun reached into her pores , drove out the cold and began to still her racing heart . She straightened her spine and prepared to face her parents and the struggle that would be her life . <p> Esther and Slim had not gone to work that morning . They sat in the living room of their home , waiting . On the floor next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not open until 10:00 a.m. " written in bold print . Esther was holding a copy of the text that Azaria had just read in the Board Room . On the bottom of the paper , Azaria had scrawled , " Mum , I 'm taking up where you left off . Do n't be angry . " <p> A heavy silence hung in the air . Slim took the paper from Esther 's hand and held it close to his face as though trying to decipher the script from some lost civilisation . His breathing seemed to shake his slender frame . At last , he looked across to Esther . Her attention had shifted to the sunshine flooding through the bay window . <p> " It does n't make sense , " he said in a choked voice . " It just does n't make any sense . " <p> Esther said nothing . She continued to stare at the dust particles trapped in the shafts of sunlight . <p> Slim shook the typewritten sheet . His anger made the paper give a sharp crackling sound . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he cried . " This wo n't hurt them . Only her . " He put his head in his hands . " All our work , all our hopes for her  --  gone ! " <p> The whispered despair in that last word wrenched Esther away from the window . She moved closer to Slim and kissed him . <p> " I do n't really understand , " she said . " Maybe it 's just something she felt she had to do . " <p> Slim raised his eyes and looked straight at Esther for a moment , long enough for her to see the full extent of his pain . Then , without a word , he got to his feet , slammed out of the house and into his taxi . The roar of the taxi 's engine filled the void in Esther 's head for what seemed like hours afterwards . <p> When silence eventually returned , Esther glanced around her and saw the comforts that she and Slim had carefully accumulated over the years . They had thought these familiar objects would provide them with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But as the sun poured in , the most solid thing in the room seemed to be the dazzling sheet of white paper , lying in an attitude of defiance , in the middle of the floor . Esther went over , almost fearfully , and picked up Azaria 's censure of the way things worked in their country . Thoughts of the summer of ' 59 engulfed her like a balm , easing the strained muscles of her neck and back . <p> " It 's her turn to try , " she whispered to the hushed room . " Maybe it wo n't be just a dream anymore . " <p> Esther looked up at the window again and saw how the sun made the particles of dust shine and how they moved and floated free . <p> At the western tip of the island , Nurse Cumberbatch pulled back the curtain drawn across the sliding glass door and the sun streamed in . <p> " How 's my sweetheart this morning ? " the nurse asked , beaming . <p> " Good ? You 're the lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed and touched her favourite patient 's smooth cheek . <p> " Somebody came early this morning and left something for you . Here it is . You want me to open it for you ? " <p> Nurse Cumberbatch opened a small white envelope . <p> " Look , Pearl . It 's beautiful . " <p> She slipped the ring on Pearl 's finger and they both watched as its dark fires danced in the heart of the stone . <p> For the first time in a very long time , Pearl smiled . <p>
