Would you permit the police to search your home , at will and without a warrant , if doing so would reduce crime ? Defying his liberal constituency , Bill Clinton says if you 're one of the 3 million mostly poor and mostly black Americans living in the nation 's 17,491 public housing projects , you would  --  and you should . Acting on that conviction , the President is urging local housing agencies to rewrite their leases so residents can allow cops to do just that . <P> Ever since Richard Nixon 's 1968 campaign for the White House , Presidents have pledged to " restore law and order . " Nixon could n't  --  and neither have his successors . Twenty-six years and 11 federal crime bills later , Americans are more worried than ever about their personal safety . The latest answer , the crime bill pending in Congress , is filled with feel-good , get-tough provisions  --  " Singapore solutions , " say its critics  --  along with several proposals that could truly make a difference , like Clinton 's measure to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart of the President 's plans to revitalize the country 's inner cities  --  where most crime occurs  --  lies in two radical ideas . <P> The first one , involving the " sweeps , " as they 're called , is really about values . Taking dead aim at the Fourth Amendment 's prohibition against " unreasonable " and warrantless searches , the President , who once taught constitutional law , wants the concept of reasonableness balanced to conform with today 's conditions . " There are many rights ( ( guaranteed by ) ) our laws . . . but ( ( victims ) ) have certain rights that we are letting slip away , " says Clinton . " They include the right to go out to the playground and the right to walk to the corner without fear of gunfire , the right to go to school safely , and to sit by an open window . " <P> This week the heads of the nation 's 40 leading public housing agencies will gather in Washington to hear the case for the lease provisions Clinton favors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argues White House counsel Lloyd Cutler , because " residing in publicly funded housing is a privilege , not a right "  --  but political reality renders mandatory provisions impossible . So , says Cutler , " we 're hoping that the majority of project tenants " who have signaled their support for Clinton 's plan " will exert peer pressure " on those reluctant to go along . However the idea plays  --  and it will surely be tested in court  --  the Administration aims primarily to send a message . " Voluntarily signing such leases is an empowering act , " says White House aide Rahm Emanuel . " It allows people to exert some control over their lives . " <P> Still , as Clinton acknowledges , warrantless searches are only a Band-Aid . The harder challenge , embodied in the President 's second controversial idea , is to turn public housing developments into decent and desirable places to live . What Robert Kennedy said about the projects 25 years ago remains just as true today : they are " separate nations screening the poor from the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
