<p> After a decade of calculations , the first wave of materials designed from scratch on the computer are ready to be made and tested . On the horizon : new substrates for optics and Electronics . <p> The first thing you notice about Gerbrand Ceder 's materials science lab at MIT is that there are no crucibles , no furnaces , no crystal-growing instruments . Instead , you find a row of high-resolution computer displays with grad students and postdocs tweaking code and constructing colorful 3-D images . It 's in this room , quiet except for the hum of fans cooling the computer power , where new high-tech ceramics and electronic materials that have never been seen or made before are being forged . They are taking form " in virtuo "  --  designed from scratch on the computer , distilled out of the basic laws of physics . <p> The next thing you 're likely to notice is how young Ceder is . Quick to laugh but intensely passionate in explaining his work , the 33-year-old associate professor is one of a new breed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have turned to discovering materials using computers . The dream is simple : Replace the age-old practice of finding new substances by trial and error , with calculations based on the laws of quantum mechanics that predict the properties of materials before you make them . <p> You can , in theory at least , design metals , semiconductors and ceramics atom by atom , adjusting the structure as you go to achieve desired effects . That should make it possible to come up with , say , a new composition for an electronic material much faster . Even more important , tinkering with atomic structure on a computer makes it possible to invent classes of materials that defy the instincts of the trial-and-error traditionalists . <p> It 's an idea that has been kicking around for at least a decade . But with the explosion in accessible computer power , as well as the development of better software and theories , it 's becoming a reality . Last year , Ceder and his collaborators at MIT synthesized one of the first materials that had actually been predicted on a computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap and efficient electrode for batteries . And while it may or may not lead to a better , lighter rechargeable battery , the success of Ceder 's group  --  and related work at a handful of other labs  --  is proving that useful materials can be designed from the basic laws of physics . <p> Designing from first principles represents a whole new way of doing materials science , a discipline that Ceder describes as " a collection of facts with some brilliant insights thrown in . " It 's a transformation he 's been aiming at since his undergraduate days in the late 1980s at Universite Catholique de Louvain in Belgium . " My background is heat and beat metallurgy , " he explains . " But I always thought there should be more to it , some way to calculate things using all the great physics of quantum mechanics . " <p> Getting there , however , wo n't be easy . Scientists have known for decades that , according to the rules of quantum mechanics , if you could detail the position of the electrons swarming around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material . Yet the sheer difficulty of carrying out these calculations has made the task seem hopeless . The computations are hard for even one molecule , but for the huge numbers of atoms that make up even the smallest chunk of a solid material , the chore is truly intimidating . <p> In the search for new vaccines and drugs , where computer-aided design has taken off , progress has been achieved precisely because the designers have been able to skip the influence of particular electrons , along with the rigorous quantum calculations . But inorganic materials are tougher . The properties of metals , alloys , semiconductors and oxides result from a vast sea of interconnected atoms and electrons . " With metals and ceramics , we really need to include the electrons as active players , " explains Erich Wimmer of Molecular Simulation , a software company that markets molecular and materials computer modeling programs . " And that means we need quantum mechanical methods . " <p> The linchpin of quantum mechanics is the Schrodinger Equation , which describes how electrons arrange themselves around atoms and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Equation generates a " wave function " giving the probability that an electron will be at a given location at a given time . What makes it so powerful is that the wave function can reveal physical properties of the system : energy , optical absorption , conductivity . If done right , you insert the atomic masses and crystal structure , and out pops the physical properties of the material . The calculations are called " first principles " or " ab initio " because you start with the most fundamental information about the atoms and use the most basic rules of physics . The price researchers pay for this ability is that the Schrodinger Equation requires immense computer power to solve , even for simple atomic structures . The Right Stuff <p> Eight years ago , ceder showed up at MIT ( he received his PhD from the University of California , Berkeley , in 1991 ) as a newly minted professor ready to give the Schrodinger Equation a try on one of materials science 's most pressing problems : better batteries . Today 's frenzy for cell phones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful storage materials . Lithium cobalt oxide is the electrode of choice for lightweight high-power applications , particularly products like cell phones . But lithium is expensive-and cobalt is even pricier . The costs can be passed on in high-tech gadgets like cell phones and laptops but for other uses , such as powering electric cars , it 's prohibitive . <p> Several of Ceder 's MIT colleagues began working on an improved battery . But it was obvious they needed better , cheaper oxide materials to serve as the electrodes . The traditional materials science strategy would have called for mixing up a batch of an oxide and then adding and subtracting components a little at a time . But there are almost unlimited combinations of ingredients you can put in  --  and every ingredient affects every other ingredient . " Every time you make a chemical change , lots of other things get altered too , " explains Ceder . " There may be structural changes , and who knows what else . " <p> Ceder attacked the problem by creating the samples and testing them not on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that you have full control over what you do , " he says . " If I take a crystal , and add a little bit of some element , I can see exactly how the electrical conductivity will change . " Systematically changing the electrode composition , Ceder used his software code to calculate the effects on battery voltage . By replacing the cobalt with titanium , or vanadium , could they get a peppier energy cell ? <p> What they found was surprising . The voltage did n't depend strongly on the cobalt . In fact , the voltage was highest if all the cobalt were replaced with aluminum . This was entirely unexpected , Ceder says , because aluminum had been thought to be a nonplayer in battery oxides . But there was a hitch . Lithium aluminum oxide is an insulator . So even though the numbers showed the voltage would be at a peak , there would be no way to run a current through it . Calculations indicated , however , that a mixture of cobalt and aluminum might just do the job : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to replace the rest . <p> That , at least , is what the computer showed . Someone still had to make the stuff . Enlisting the help of MIT ceramists , Ceder and his colleagues developed methods to synthesize the predicted cobalt-aluminum electrodes  --  materials that had never been made before . It turns out that , in fact , the mixture of cobalt/aluminum gives a higher battery voltage than cobalt alone . At the same time , the aluminum lowered the overall weight of the material , so that the energy density  --  another important figure for a good battery  --  went up , and the projected cost of the material went down . Arranged Marriage <p> Do n't expect to find Cobalt-aluminum electrodes in a battery anytime soon , however . Although the new battery material is superior in voltage and costs to conventional electrodes , the conservatism of the power-storage business means that it 's not likely to be commercialized in the near future . Still , the success of Ceder 's group marks a significant advance because it means a material has been designed on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Scientists are far from being able to plunk themselves down at a keyboard , tap in some desired properties , and have a new substance pop out . Ceder points out that electronic and optical properties are relatively amenable to calculation , whereas other important characteristics , like hardness or corrosion resistance , are more difficult to compute . Those properties , for one thing , depend on events occurring over a wide range of size and time scales ( see " Cracking a Tough Problem , " p. 58 ) . " There are still a lot of problems you ca n't address by these methods , " he says . <p> For now , though , the rewards of finding novel electronic and optical materials are more than enough to keep top materials researchers interested . A few dozen meters from Ceder 's lab , another MIT group , headed by theoretical physicist John Joannopoulos , believes it has solved one of the toughest puzzles in semiconductor research  --  providing a material bridge between electronics and optics . <p> Such a connection could make it possible to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But getting there means mating silicon with stuff that has favorable optical properties . And from a materials science point of view , there is a major hurdle : Optical and electronic materials tend to be incompatible . " Silicon is great for making electronic circuits , but it has lousy optical properties " says Joannopoulos . " Things like gallium arsenide that have good optical properties hate to be stuck on top of silicon . " <p> The reason is that the best optical materials for the part of the spectrum that industry is interested in  --  around wavelengths of 1.5 micrometers  --  have atomic spacings that do n't match silicon . So , if you grow gallium arsenide on silicon , the mismatch causes havoc in the interface  --  stress , strain and defects galore . This situation presented a unique opportunity for **28;429;TOOLONG , says Joannopoulos . " We asked ourselves , could we take the specifications and design a material to meet them ? " <p> The answer : yes . The timeframe : a decade of difficult calculations . The solution involved a recipe for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silicon surface , each layer from a different group in the periodic table . If the approach had been tried experimentally , it would have involved an almost unlimited number of combinations , and each batch would have to have been synthesized and tested . Instead , Joannopoulos and his coworkers did extensive ab initio calculations on the computer to nail down the optical properties and the atomic spacing . <p> This year , grad student Tairan Wang finally hit on a layering scheme that created a new material with the right structure to join smoothly with the silicon surface and still act as an optical material . By putting down arsenic , zinc , silicon and phosphorus in just the right order  --  on the computer , of course  --  he was able to hit the target . " The main thing is we 've identified a class of compounds , " says Joannopoulos , " so if this particular one is difficult to fabricate , we can try another that will also meet the specifications . " <p> Once you 've cleverly designed something on a computer , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff . In the case of Joannopoulos ' new optoelectronic material , the problem is that nobody has a synthesis setup that can spray the atomically precise layers of the four different clements . But after a decade of struggling to find the right structure , Joannopoulos is n't worried . He says a couple of labs are interested . And he expects to get to work soon on actually making the material . Playing God <p> Whatever the eventual value of these computationally designed materials , the work is unquestionably opening up researchers ' imaginations . Like Ceder , Efthimios Kaxiras is one of the new generation of materials researchers more skilled in computational physics than in firing up a laboratory kiln . An MIT graduate and former student of Joannopoulos , Kaxiras is now an associate professor of physics at Harvard University , where he is dreaming up materials that no one has ever seen . <p> In one such research project , Kaxiras is envisioning tiny clusters of silicon atoms that could perform useful tasks . " When you take a few hundred atoms of something , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . In thinking about how silicon atoms bond , Kaxiras came up with a new structure containing a mere 45 atoms . " These 45 silicon atoms form two mirror-image structures , " he explains . " And if you could figure out how to induce one to change into the other , you could have a tiny switch . " <p> Clearly a switch only 45 atoms big would make circuit designers delirious . By comparison , there are hundreds of thousands of atoms in each of today 's smallest circuit elements . But the silicon clusters remain very much in the realm of the virtual imagination . Says Kaxiras , " Nothing is known about these structures . I came up with them by thinking of the possibilities , and then I fed the structures into the computer to learn more about their stability and physical properties . " Kaxiras says more experimental work is needed to know even whether these structures actually can be created . <p> " It 's really hard playing God , " says Joannopoulos of his 10-year quest for novel optoelectronic materials . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws of physics is , in many ways , more demanding than the trial-and-error approach to finding substances . It requires unconventional thinking about materials and the skillful use of a computational tool kit that is only now being developed . But if this new breed of researchers succeed , they could be on the verge of creating a whole new materials world . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Flashes of the future : Gerbrand Ceder is using computers to design new battery electrodes . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Calculations in hand : Theoretical physicist John Joannopoulos has invented new optoelectronic materials  --  on paper at least . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Phantom materials : Efthimios Kaxiras ' tiny silicon clusters could revolutionize microelectronics . But can they be made ? <p> By David Voss <p> CRACKING A TOUGH PROBLEM <p> A fracture in metal may seem like a simple thing . But for materials scientists , understanding how cracks propagate is one of the grand challenges of computational research . Answers could help save billions of dollars now spent each year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But computationally explaining dynamic processes in materials , such as the formation of a fracture , is extraordinarily difficult because the events happen across vastly different lengths . <p> At Harvard University , Efthimios Kaxiras , an associate professor of physics , is collaborating with researchers at the Naval Research Laboratory and Farid Abraham at IBM 's Almaden Research Center , to develop a description of fracturing that spans these scales : from chemical bonds breaking to bulk matter vibrating . <p> A crack in a solid is shown in ( a ) . In this view , the solid is described by classical mechanics ; the structure of the atoms is not considered . At the mesoscopic scale ( b ) , a certain amount of information about the atomistic structure is taken into account , such as the material 's crystal structure . In ( c ) , the microscopic regime , the atomistic structure is described using quantum mechanics . Properties that occur on a larger scale , such as fracturing , are analyzed by looking at how individual atoms behave ; but since only a relatively small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small region of the material can be looked at in this way . The information must be effectively incorporated into the mesoscopic description . In turn , that analysis must be incorporated in the macroscopic picture . <p>
