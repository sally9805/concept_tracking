<p> BLAME THE ' NEWCOMERs ' FOR STATE TROUBLES <p> Editor  --  Proponents of Proposition 187 seem to be saying that California 's economic woes  --  an increasing population making increasing demands on diminishing resources  --  are largely attributable to the recent wave of immigration . I think they may be on to something here . <p> Until very recently , the population of California has remained remarkably stable for over 10,000 years , and the population enjoyed a high standard of living with most people only working an average of 20 to 25 hours per week . <p> All of this has changed for the worse since the most recent wave of immigration began about 250 years ago . ( It 's interesting to note that many of these most recent immigrants seem to have the peculiar belief that either God or the Constitution gives them the right to make a profit from land regardless of the public good . ) <p> I 'm not sure what to do about this . Proposition 187 may not go far enough . Perhaps we should consider legislation requiring anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with legitimacy dating back at least 500 years . <p> LARRY ROBINSON <p> Sebastopol <p> . <p> FOR SHAME , HENRY ! <p> Editor  --  The sight and sound of Henry Kissinger stridently supporting the candidacy of Governor Wilson is truly nauseating . <p> An immigrant himself , his probable death in the Holocaust likely was spared by his finding a welcome in the United States . <p> Having himself achieved wealth and success in his new home , he now , most gracelessly , joins forces with a candidate who is engaged in the most despicable attack upon immigrants in recent American politics . Shame , shame ! <p> HARRY ZEITLIN <p> Berkeley <p> . <p> QUESTIONS FOR BROWN <p> Editor  --  Before the press anoints Kathleen Brown as the Rosa Parks of date rape , I feel they are first obligated to pose some difficult questions . <p> Why was the rape not reported ? Who is the alleged rapist ? If Kathleen Brown is tough on crime , she should not want a rapist to be walking around scot free . <p> Also , by not naming him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with her daughter during that time period . <p> Date rape is a murky , ill-defined area of law , and allegations of such should not be tossed around loosely in the public arena . If Kathleen Brown is to govern California , she owes the public answers to these questions . <p> BILL McGREGOR <p> Berkeley <p> . <p> ENOUGH OF INITIATIVES <p> Editor  --  It 's about time for Californians to finally get mad enough to get rid of the law that allows ( and invites ) making law by referendum . How many initiatives on this year 's ballot ? I only know because I looked at my voter 's guide , but it is too many . Too many by far ! <p> Initiatives were supposed to give the people a last resort if the Legislature fails to act . It has become a game and a big business , with Californians the losers . <p> I will vote against every initiative on this year 's ballot . I wish everyone else would too . <p> Then , let 's see a change in the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses of the Legislature to have had a bill before them with the exact wording of a proposed initiative for one year before anyone can circulate a petition for it ? <p> A. DAVID ROSSIN <p> Los Altos Hills <p> . <p> ' I 'VE GOT MINE ' <p> Editor  --  In the " Brown Shoe Army " ( World War II ) , there was a saying , " I 've got mine , how about yours ? " <p> In the coming election the wealthy and privileged will be saying the same thing with their votes . They will be voting to protect and enhance their financial and class status . They will be out in force , while it is predicted that those less favored will stay away from the polls in droves . <p> If politicians who favor maintaining and enhancing the wealthy are elected , and initiatives and referendums are passed or defeated helping those who boast " I 've got mine , " those who decline to vote will be responsible . <p> The haves are depending on it ! <p> RICHARD T. SCHULTZ <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Editor  --  As the author of San Francisco 's Proposition G , I was not surprised by The Chronicle 's October 17 editorial opposing the measure . <p> Prop . G is a serious grass-roots reform effort whose diverse supporters include neighborhood tenant groups , landlords , Realtors , homeowners , builders , AIDS service providers , homeless activists and many religious leaders . Such coalitions pose a threat to elite institutions like The Chronicle and its Chamber of Commerce allies . <p> It was disappointing , however , that the editorial intentionally misrepresented Prop . G. <p> Prop . G is strongly supported by the builders and property owners who pay permit fees because the measure eliminates three $ 90,000-a- year " assistant superintendents " and cuts bureaucratic waste . This is why the Board of Supervisors ' two most conservative members , Annemarie Conroy and Bill Maher , both submitted ballot arguments in support of G. <p> An even bigger falsehood is your claim that Prop . G was " tailor made " for board President Angela Alioto . <p> Because Prop . G would take effect in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial three appointments . <p> Contrary to your editorial , these initial appointments are for only one year . The two-year terms will be subsequently appointed by the candidate elected board president this November . All of the potential board presidents  --  Supervisors Migden , Shelley , Conroy , Leal and candidate Tom Ammiano  --  are strong supporters of Prop . G. <p> Delaying Prop . G 's implementation until a new board president was inducted would have meant another month without heat for the low-income seniors and children who have suffered most from the city 's refusal to enforce housing laws . <p> We would rather sacrifice The Chronicle 's endorsement than betray the public 's demand for increased accountability in city government . <p> RANDY SHAW <p> Tenderloin Housing Clinic <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> RED-LIGHT TRAGEDY <p> Editor  --  Tuesday night 's unfortunate accident at 19th and Holloway avenues at San Francisco State University underscores again the urgent need to completely rethink the design of that intersection and the approaching streets . <p> This is particularly true of the northbound approach , which some drivers use almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " launch " themselves up 19th Avenue at considerable risk to the crowds of people waiting at that ill- fated bus stop . <p> Many of us in the SFSU community have long expected an accident of this type to occur there , and undoubtedly the risk for more such accidents remains until the whole area is " fixed . " <p> Nevertheless , one effective measure that can be taken immediately is that stoplights could be staggered , such that a few seconds would elapse between a light 's turning red and traffic in another direction being given a green light . <p> Until people in the Bay Area once again place a higher value on safety than the few seconds gained by running red lights , we will have to deal with the unfortunately dangerous reality of the way we drive . <p> DAVID HAND <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> PALM TREE TRADITION <p> Editor  --  Anyone can plainly see by looking at our coastal hills that there are very few " native trees , " let alone " graceful " ones , which Doris Clark ( Letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Embarcadero . <p> The palms are a very good choice for the shallow soil there and our drought conditions . While not native , palm trees have a long tradition of beautifying San Francisco . <p> Nearly all our trees , like nearly all of us , have come from elsewhere . <p> JOCELYN J. MINER <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> DROP IN THE BUCKET <p> Editor  --  So Richard Martz of Novato ( Letters , October 17 ) thinks the media has shown women more respect than men ? <p> Where was he when all the stories about the Wonderbra were splashed all over newspapers , TV and magazines ? <p> Where has he been during the debate about silicone breast implants ? <p> I could go on . . . but the fact of the matter is , The Chronicle 's piece about penile enhancement surgery was just a drop in the bucket compared to the number of stories that have been written about women 's bodies over the years . <p> Get used to it . <p> TERRY CONWAY <p> San Francisco
