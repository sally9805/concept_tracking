Rayford Steele wore the uniform of the enemy of his soul , and he hated himself for it . He strode through Iraqi sand toward Baghdad Airport in his dress blues and was struck by the incongruity of it all . From across the parched plain he heard the wails and screams of hundreds he wouldnt begin to be able to help . Any prayer of finding his wife alive depended on how quickly he could get to her . But there was no quick here . Only sand . And what about Chloe and Buck in the States ? And Tsion ? Desperate , frantic , mad with frustration , he ripped off his natty waistcoat with its yellow braid , heavy epaulettes , and arm patches that identified a senior officer of the Global Community . Rayford did not take the time to unfasten the solid-gold buttons but sent them popping across the desert floor . He let the tailored jacket slide from his shoulders and clutched the collar in his fists . Three , four , five times he raised the garment over his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand kicked up over his patent leather shoes . Rayford considered abandoning all vestiges of his connection to Nicolae Carpathias regime , but his attention was drawn again to the luxuriously appointed arm patches . He tore at them , intending to rip them free , as if busting himself from his own rank in the service of the Antichrist . But the craftsmanship allowed not even a fingernail between the stitches , and Rayford slammed the coat to the ground one more time . He stepped and booted it like an extra point , finally aware of what had made it heavier . His phone was in the pocket . As he knelt to retrieve his coat , Rayfordsmaddening logic returned &shy; the practicality that made him who he was . Having no idea what he might find in the ruins of his condominium , he couldnt treat as dispensable what might constitute his only remaining set of clothes . Rayford jammed his arms into the sleeves like a little boy made to wear a jacket on a warm day . He had nt bothered to shake the grit from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains of the airport , Rayfords lanky frame was less impressive than usual . He could have been the survivor of a crash , a pilot whod lost his cap and seen the buttons stripped from his uniform . Rayford could not remember a chill before sundown in all the months hed lived in Iraq . Yet something about the earthquake had changed not only the topography , but also the temperature . Rayford had been used to damp shirts and a sticky film on his skin . But now wind , that rare , mysterious draft , chilled him as he speed dialed Mac McCullum and put the phone to his ear . At that instant he heard the chug and whir of Macs chopper behind him . He wondered where they were going . Mac here , cam McCullums gravely voice . Rayford whirled and watched the copter eclipse the descending sun . I cant believe this thing works , Rayford said . He had slammed it to the ground and kicked it , but he also assumed the earthquake would have taken out nearby cellular towers . Soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ray , Mac said . Everythings down for as far as I can see . These units act like walkie-talkies when were close . When you need a cellular boost , you wont find it . So any chance of call the States &shy; Is out of the question , Mac said . Ray , Potentate Carpathia wants to speak to you , but first &shy; I do nt want to talk to him , and you can tell him that . But before I give you to him , Mac continued , I need to remind you that our meetings , yours and mine , is still on for tonight . Right ? Rayford slowed and stared at the ground , running a hand through his hair . What ? What are you talking about ? All right then , very good , Mac said . Were still meeting tonight then . Now the potentate &shy; I understand you want to talk to me later , Mac , but do nt put Carpathia on or I swear Ill &shy; Stand by for the potentate . Rayford switched the phone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , but he restrained himself . When avenues of communication reopened , he wanted to be able to check on his loved ones . Captain Steele , came the emotionless tone of Nicolae Carpathia . Im here , Rayford said , allowing his disgust to come through . He assumed God would forgive anything he said to the Antichrist , but he swallowed what he really wanted to say . Though we both know how I could respond to your egregious disrespect and insubordination , Carpathia said , I choose to forgive you . Rayford continued walking , clenching his teeth to keep from screaming at the man . I can tell you are a loss for how to express your gratitude , Carpathia continued . Now listen to me . I have a safe place and provisions where my international ambassadors and staff will join me . You and I both know we need each other , so I suggest &shy; You do nt need me , Rayford said . And I do nt need your forgiveness . You have a perfectly capable pilot right next to you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ready when he lands , Carpathia said , the first hint of frustration in his voice . The only place I would accept a ride to is the airport , Rayford said . And Im almost there . Do nt have Mac set down any closer to this mess . Captain Steele , Carpathia began again , condescendingly , I admire your irrational belief that you can somehow find your wife , but we both know that is not going to happen . Rayford said nothing . He feared Carpathia was right , but he would never give him the satisfaction of admitting it . And he would certainly never quit looking until he proved to himself Amanda had not survived . Come with us , Captain Steele . Just reboard , and I will treat your outburst as if it never &shy; Im not going anywhere until Ive found my wife ! Let me talk to Mac . Officer McCullum is busy . I will pass along a message . Mac could fly that thing with no hands . Now let me talk to him . If there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you win . Just tell Mac &shy; Now is no time to neglect protocol , Captain Steele . A pardoned subordinate is behooved to address his superior &shy; All right , Potentate Carpathia , just tell Mac to come for me if I do nt find a way back by 2200 hours . And should you find a way back , the shelter is three and a half clicks northeast of the original headquarters . You will need the following password : Operation Wrath . What ? Carpathia knew this was coming ? You heard me , Captain Steele . Cameron Buck Williams stepped gingerly through the rubble near the ventilation shaft where he had heard the clear , healthy voice of Rabbi Tsion Ben-Judah , trapped in the underground shelter . Tsion assured him he was unhurt , just scared and claustrophobic . That place was small enough without the church imploding above it . With no way out unless someone tunneled to him , the rabbi , Buck knew , would soon feel like a caged animal . Had Tsion been in immediate danger , Buck would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buck felt like a doctor in triage , having to determine who most urgently needed his help . Assuring Tsion he would return , he headed toward the safe house to find his wife . To get through the trash that had been the only church home he ever knew , Buck had to again crawl past the remains of the beloved Loretta . What a friend she had been , first to the late Bruce Barnes and then to the rest of the Tribulation Force . The Force had begun with four : Rayford , Chloe , Bruce , and Buck . Amanda was added . Bruce was lost . Tsion was added . Was it possible now that they had been reduced to just Buck and Tsion ? Buck did nt want to think about it . He found his watch gunked up with mud , asphalt , and a tiny shard of windshield . He wiped the crystal across his pant leg and felt the crusty mixture tear his trousers and bit into his knee . It was nine oclock in the morning in Mt . Prospect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warning siren , emergency vehicle sirens &shy; one close , two farther away . Shouts . Screams . Sobbing . Engines . Could he live without Chloe ? Buck had been given a second chance ; he was here for a purpose . He wanted the love of his life by his side , and he prayed &shy; selfishly he realized &shy; that she had not already preceded him to heaven . In his peripheral vision , Buck noticed the selling of his own left cheek . He had felt neither pain nor blood and had assumed the wound was minor . Now he wondered . He reached in his breast pocket for his mirrored lensed sunglasses . One lens was in pieces . In the reflection of the other he saw a scarecrow , hair wild , eyes white with fear , mouth open and sucking air . The wound was not bleeding , yet it appeared deep . There would be no time for treatment . Buck emptied his shirt pocket but kept the frames &shy; a gift from Chloe . He studied the ground as he moved back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nails , and bricks like an old man , assuring himself solid purchase . Buck passed Lorettas car and what was left of her , determined not to look . Suddenly the earth moved , and he stumbled . Lorettas car , which he had been unable to budge moments before , rocked and disappeared . The ground had given way under the parking lot . Buck stretched out on his stomach and peeked over the edge of a new crevice . The mangled car rested atop a water main twenty feet beneath the earth . The blown tires pointed up like the feet of bloated roadkill . Curled in a frail ball atop the wreckage was the Raggedy Ann-like body of Loretta , a tribulation saint . There would be more shifting of the earth . Reaching Lorettas body would be impossible . If he was also to find Chloe dead , Buck wished God had let him plunge under the earth with Lorettas car . Buck rose slowly , suddenly aware of what the roller coaster ride through the earthquake had done to his joints and muscles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had rolled and been hit from all sides , it appeared remarkably roadworthy . The drivers-side door was jammed , the windshield in gummy pieces throughout the interior , and the rear seat had broken away from the floor on one side . One tire had been slashed to the steel belts but looked strong and held air . Where were Bucks phone and laptop ? He had set them on the front seat . He hoped against hope neither had flown out in the mayhem . Buck opened the passenger door and peered onto the floor of the front seat . Nothing . He looked under the rear seats , all the way to the back . In a corner , open and with one screen hinge cracked , was his laptop . Buck found his phone in a door well . He did nt expect to be able to get through to anyone , with all the damage to cellular towers ( and everything else above ground ) . He switched it on , and it went through a self-test and showed zero range . Still , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nt even get a malfunction message from the phone company . The same happened when he dialed the church , then Tsions shelter . As if playing a cruel joke , the phone made noises as if trying to get through . Then , nothing . Bucks landmarks were gone . He was grateful the Range Rover had a built in compass . Even the church seemed twisted from its normal perspective on the corner . Poles and lines and traffic lights were down , buildings flattened , trees uprooted , fences strewn about . Buck made sure the Range Rover was in four-wheel drive . He could barely travel twenty feet before having to punch the car over some rise . He kept his eyes peeled to avoid anything that might further damage the Rover &shy; it might have to last him through the end of the Tribulation . The best he could figure , that was still more than five years away . As Buck rolled over chunks of asphalt and concrete where the street once lay , he glanced again at the vestiges of New Hope Village Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section of pews , which had once faced west , now faced north and glistened in the sun . The entire sanctuary floor appeared to have turned ninety degrees . As he passed the church , he stopped and stared . A shaft of light appeared between each pair of pews in the ten-pew section except in one spot . There something blocked Bucks view . He threw the Rover into reverse and carefully backed up . On the floor in front of one of those pews were the bottoms of a pair of tennis shoes , toes pointing up . Buck wanted , above all , to get to Lorettas and search for Chloe , but he could not leave someone lying in the debris . Was it possible someone had survived ? He set the brake and scrambled over the passenger seat and out the door , recklessly trotting through stuff that could slice through his shoes . He wanted to be practical but there was no time for that . Buck lost his footing ten feet from those tennis shoes and pitched face forward . He took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He pulled himself up and knelt next to the tennis shoes , which were attached to a body . Thin legs in dark blue jeans led to narrow hips . From the waist up , the small body was hidden under the pew . The right hand was tucked underneath , the left lay open and limp . Buck found no pulse , but he noticed the hand was broad and bony , the third finger bearing a mans wedding band . Buck slipped it off , assuming a surviving wife might want it . Buck grabbed the belt buckle and dragged the body from under the bench . When the head slid into view , Buck turned away . He recognized Donny Moores blond coloring only from his eyebrows . The rest of his hair , even his sideburns , was encrusted with blood . Buck did nt know what to do in the face of the dead and dying at a time like this . Where would anyone begin disposing of millions of corpses all over the world ? Buck gently pushed the body back under the pew but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found Donnys beat up , hard-sided briefcase . Buck tried the latches , but combination locks had been set . He lugged the briefcase back to the Range Rover and tried again to find his bearings . He was a scant four blocks from Lorettas , but could he even find the street ? Rayford was encouraged to see movement in the distance at Baghdad Airport . He saw more wreckage and carnage on the ground than people scurrying about , but at least not all had been lost . A small , dark figure with a strange gait appeared on the horizon . Rayford watched , fascinated , as the image materialized into a stocky , middle-aged Asian in a business suit . The man walked directly toward Rayford , who waited expectantly , wondering if he could help . But as the man drew near , Rayford realized he was not aware of his surroundings . He wore a wing-tipped dress shoe on one foot with only a sock sliding down the ankle of the other . His suit coat was buttoned , but his tie hung outside it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mussed , yet his glasses appeared to have been untouched by whatever he had endured . Are you all right ? Rayford asked . The man ignored him . Can I help you ? The man limped past , mumbling in his own tongue . Rayford turned to cal him back , and the man became a silhouette in the orange sun . There was nothing in that direction but the Tigris River . Wait ! Rayford called after him . Come back ! Let me help you ! The man ignored him , and Rayford dialed Mac again . Let me talk to Carpathia , he said . Sure , Mac said . Were set on that meeting tonight , right ? Right , now let me talk to him . I mean our personal meeting , right ? Yes ! I do nt know what you want , but yes , I get the point . Now I need to talk to Carpathia . Okay , sorry . Here he is . Change your mind , Captain Steele ? Carpathia said . Hardly . Listen , do you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean ? he asked , repeating what the man had said . That is easy , Carpathia said . It means , You can not help me . Leave me alone . Bring Mac back around , would you ? This man is going to die of exposure . I thought you were looking for your wife . I cant leave a man to wander to his death . Millions are dead and dying . You can not save all of them . I do not see him , Captain Steele . If you think you can save him , be my guest . I do not mean to be cold , but I have the whole world at heart just now . Rayford slapped his phone shut and hurried back to the lurching , mumbling man . As he drew near , Rayford was horrified to see why his gait was so strange and why he trailed a river of blood . He had been impaled by a gleaming white chunk of metal , apparently some piece of fuselage . Why he was still alive , how he survived or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imbedded from his hip to the back of his head . It had to have missed vital organs by centimeters . Rayford touched the mans shoulder , causing him to wrench away . He sat heavily , and with a huge sigh toppled slowly in the sand and breathed his last . Rayford checked for a pulse , not surprised to find none . Overcome , he turned his back and knelt in the dirt . Sobs wracked his body . Rayford raised his hands to the sky . Why God ? Why do I have to see this ? Why send someone across my path I cant even help ? Spare Chloe and Buck ! Please keep Amanda alive for me ! I know I do nt deserve anything , but I cant go on without her ! Usually Buck drove two blocks south and two east from the church to Lorettas . But now there were no more blocks . No sidewalks , no streets , no intersections . For as far as Buck could see , every house in the neighborhood had been leveled . Could it have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a quarter of the worlds population would fall victim to the wrath of the Lamb . But Buck would be surprised if even a quarter of the population of Mt . Prospect was still alive . He lined up the Range Rover on a southeastern course . A few degrees above the horizon the day was as beautiful as any Buck could remember . The sky , where not interrupted by smoke and dust , was baby blue . No clouds . Bright sun . Geysers shot skyward where fire hydrants had ruptured . A woman crawled out from the wreckage of her home , a bloody stump at her shoulder where her arm had been . She screamed at Buck , Kill me ! Kill me ! He shouted , No ! and leaped from the Rover as she bent and grabbed a chunk of glass from a broken window and dragged it across her neck . Buck continued to yell as he sprinted to her . He only hoped she was too weak to do anything but superficial damage to her neck , and he prayed she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet of her when she stared , startled . The glass broke and tinkled to the ground . She stepped back and tripped , her head smacking loudly on the a chunk of concrete . Immediately the blood stopped pumping from her exposed arteries . Her eyes were lifeless as Buck forced her eyes open and covered her mouth with his . Buck blew air into her throat , making her chest rise and her blood trickle , but it was futile . Buck looked around , wondering whether to try to cover her . Across the way an elderly man stood at the edge of a crater and seemed to will himself to tumble into it . Buck could take no more . Was God preparing him for the likelihood that Chloe had not survived ? He wearily climbed back into the Range Rover , deciding he absolutely could not stop and help anyone else who did not appear to really want it . Everywhere he looked he saw devastation , fire , water , and blood . Against his better judgment , Rayford left the dead man in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others in various states of demise ? How could Carpathia ignore this ? Had he not a shred of humanity ? Mac would have surely stayed and helped . Rayford despaired of seeing Amanda alive again , and though he would search with all that was in him , he already wished he had arranged an earlier rendezvous with Mac . Hed seen awful things in his life , but the carnage at this airport was going to top them all . A shelter , even the Antichrists , sounded better than this .
