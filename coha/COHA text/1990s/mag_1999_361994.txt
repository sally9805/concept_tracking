Group : Six People In Search Of A Life ( Riverhead ; 339 pages ; $25.95 ) , Paul Solotaroff 's tribute to his former group therapist , follows six New Yorkers with New Yorkers ' problems : too much or not enough money , sex , drugs or ambition . Throw in childhoods with cruel or irresponsible parents , and you 've got subjects willing to spend $100 a pop to discover their " true story . " <P> Collecting the door fee and directing the cast is Dr. Charles Lathon , an effective but flawed psychiatrist whom Solotaroff admires with the awe of a proselyte-grad student , having once been counseled through a bout of panic disorder in a Lathon group . Solotaroff , a journalist , profiles a group that Lathon boasts is the " smartest bunch of people I 've ever assembled " : Sara , a beautiful former model turned fashion editor crippled in her search for a husband by daddy issues ; Rex , a Wall Street jock recovering from an addiction to both coke and a blond-bombshell stripper ; Dylan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throes of alcoholism ; Jack , a 59-year-old Broadway producer and former big spender suspended from producing for seven years , a plea bargain for embezzling from his shows ; Peter , a wimpy accountant ; and Lina , a mental-health administrator , poverty-stricken by a two-year divorce fight with her millionaire husband . All the names , including the doctor 's , are pseudonyms . <P> Solotaroff promises an examination of the nuances of group therapy through these emotionally addled upper-crusters . His own two-year group experience convinced him of the doctor 's effectiveness ( " I got lucky " ) , so he does n't dissect Lathon 's new , 20-session process and the doctor 's own subsequent need of rehabilitative help . Instead he focuses on the group members . Problem is , they have stories we 've already seen on Oprah , the ultimate group forum . And it 's hard to feel sorry for these people , with their luxury homes and contact-filled resumes . The successes and failures portrayed here are neither heartwarming nor heartbreaking . This group should have just talked among themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
