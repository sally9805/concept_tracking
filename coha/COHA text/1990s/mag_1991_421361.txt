Section : HOT SPOTS <p> TEN YEARS AGO , I WAS BANNED FROM IRAQ AFTER SPEAKING OUT AGAINST Saddam Hussein at an Arab gathering in the United States . Casting aside the etiquette of after-dinner speeches , at a conference funded by the Iraqi government , I spoke harshly about the heavily armed rulers standing in the way of progress and democracy in the Middle East . <p> A prominent intellectual and politician , Munif Razzaz , had recently been tossed in prison without being charged , the Iraqi government had just prohibited its citizens from owning typewriters without getting licenses ( as if they were weapons , which I suppose many dictatorships consider them to be ) , and Iraq 's forces had invaded Iran . <p> When I criticized these actions , the Iraqi ambassador stormed out and I became persona non grata in Baghdad . So I have raised my voice in opposition to a war with Iraq not from any softness for Saddam Hussein or his party , but because of the immediate carnage and the subsequent , terrifying shifts in the regional balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As I traveled around the United States to speak at antiwar rallies during the countdown to January 15 , people invariably asked : What will happen if there is war ? During the war in Vietnam , I recall , it had been easy to predict the outcome : that Vietnam would be devastated , but the United States would lose the war morally , politically , and perhaps even militarily . <p> The consequences of war with Iraq remain equally clear : Iraq and Kuwait will be devastated , and the United States will prevail militarily . But a nightmare will begin to occur even when victory celebrations take place . I am reminded of Matthew 24:6-13 : " But the end is not yet .... For nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom ... then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted . " <p> The nightmare of an all-out U.S. military victory is an apocalyptic vision that reveals economic , cultural , and political fissures in the region . These underlying fissures deserve to be better understood , no matter how the current gulf crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IN TWO WORLDS FOR THE PAST two decades , shuttling between the United States and the Middle East , working for justice and trying to increase mutual understanding in two cultures that have intersected for centuries . But Saddam Hussein 's invasion of Kuwait and George Bush 's imperial impulses have suddenly shattered nascent promises of peace . <p> What augurs in the aftermath of war ? The " peace dividend " in a " new world order " will not be the only casualty . Aerial bombardments , upon which the U.S. military relied , historically have destroyed cities and killed people , but have had notably less effect on armies . With such an awesome concentration of firepower , human carnage of unprecedented proportions can be expected . Estimates of Arab casualties , rarely mentioned in the U.S. media , run from 200,000 to 500,000 . <p> Reverberations from this kind of violence can be expected to spread like a thunderclap through aggrieved villages and cities of the Middle East . And it is this growing anger that the American people , innocent like the Iraqis , will reap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the first Arab-American war would not be the last . Another , more protracted one could follow , making the Korean and Indo-Chinese conflicts look tame by comparison . <p> In Washington , I 've heard contradictory talk  --  of a quick-and-dirty war leading to a swift withdrawal , or , as Secretary of State James Baker has indicated , of the need to establish a permanent U.S. military presence in the region . But policymakers would do well to reflect on the experience of France in Algeria , Israel in Lebanon and the West Bank and Gaza , and the Soviet Union in Afghanistan . In the aftermath of " victory " by the United States over Iraq , the following might be expected : <p> Popular discontent in countries such as Saudi Arabia , Egypt , and Morocco will grow exponentially ; <p> U.S. allies in the region , as well as U.S. personnel , corporations , and installations , will become targets of mass agitation throughout the Middle East ; <p> A power vacuum will occur as the nationalist credibility of Egypt and Saudi Arabia plummets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Islamic government ; <p> In a drawn-out military occupation , the United States will become increasingly isolated , with Israel as its lone , expensive ally . Decline of Saudi and Egyptian Influence <p> THE AGGRESSIVE AMBITION OF SADDAM Hussein can be understood best in the context of a regional power void throughout the 1980s , created by the 1978 Camp David accords , brokered by President Jimmy Carter . When Anwar Sadat signed a separate peace with Israel , Egypt reposed its faith in U.S. promises of a step-by-step , comprehensive settlement of the Israeli-Arab conflict . But the United States failed to keep its end of the bargain ; instead of making peace , Israel proceeded to invade and conquer . <p> Arab states including Egypt watched helplessly as Israel tormented the Palestinians , colonizing their land and threatening to expel them from the remnant of their ancient homeland . This is the historical backdrop that yields such bitter cynicism in response to U.S. claims about taking a " principled " stand against Iraqi aggression . <p> After Egypt 's alienation from the Arab world , popular hopes turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Saudis had glitter and gold . Multinational corporations sought their favors . Bankers relied on their investments . Even the U.S. dollar owed its hegemony to Saudi preferences . It was reasonable to expect them to translate their economic power and strategic importance into political and diplomatic leverage to achieve Israel 's withdrawal from occupied Palestinian , Syrian , and Lebanese territories . <p> Indeed , Saudi Arabia responded to these hopes during the subsequent thirteen years with a military buildup and active diplomacy . The country entered the international arms bazaar as an extravagant buyer . In 1981 , Saudi efforts led to a cease-fire between the PLO and Israel . But in 1982 , the cease-fire was broken when Israel invaded Lebanon and devastated Beirut . An estimated twenty thousand people died and thirty thousand were wounded . The United Nations responded by passing resolutions condemning Israel , but the United States prevented the UN from taking meaningful action . Israel occupied parts of Lebanon for two years  --  and still holds a southern portion of that country . <p> The sheikhs pleaded with Washington to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could not . They are prisoners of dependence , because they have acquired wealth without working and make enormous profits without producing . Their economies are run by foreigners . They own billions but do n't control their capital . Their countries are littered with expensive machines but they have no technology . They rule over islands of affluence in a sea of poverty . <p> The sheikhs tied themselves symbiotically to the United States and could not translate their wealth into power or link pro-American trade and investment practices with even-handed U.S. policy in the Middle East . Their diplomacy was reduced to buying favors and pleading fairness . As expectations were disappointed , the sheikhs became objects of contempt . A power vacuum in the Arab world came to be palpably felt , and a war with Iraq will certainly exacerbate this condition . <p> The first signal that Iraq might fill the power vacuum created by the Saudis first came in 1980 , when Saddam Hussein invaded Iran . But instead of opposing his aggression , the United States quietly encouraged it . Also , Saudi Arabia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in aid . The " monster "  --  if that is what Saddam Hussein is  --  was created by the same forces that now oppose him . Who , or what , is the " monster " that will replace him once he falls ? <p> Among Washington 's allies in the gulf , only Syria is in a position to gain from either a negotiated settlement or war . Never a U.S. client , Syria struck a tactical alliance ; its primary objective is to regain the Golan Heights . When the gulf crisis is over , Syria will expect full U.S. support in ending Israeli occupation . When Washington proves unable or unwilling to do so , of course , wily Hafiz al-Assad will have the option of realigning  --  with Iran . <p> As I travel through the Middle East each year , I 'm struck most powerfully by rumbling discontents , some economic or political , others cultural or religious . With the exception of Saudi Arabia , the oil-producing sheikhdoms of the gulf are recent , 1960s creations . Tahseen Basheer , an Egyptian diplomat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following pattern : larger and more populous countries have small oil reserves , while the tiny sheikhdoms hold vast reserves . Rulers in the gulf know the significance of this fact , which is one reason why many governments , including that of Saudi Arabia , do not conduct censuses or publish population figures . <p> There are vast discrepancies of wealth across state boundaries . Per capita annual income , for example , in the United Arab Emirates is $15,720 , and in Kuwait $13,680  --  but in Egypt it is $650 , and in Morocco $750 . Stories of the sheikhs ' extravagances abound , and Iraqi propaganda has successfully exploited them . War will entail massive casualties among soldiers from the poor countries , fueling an explosion of longstanding resentments and furthering the isolation of pro-U.S , governments , including Egypt and Saudi Arabia . A Stronger Iran Emerges <p> IRAN 'S LEADERS ARE DRINKING TEA OVER the conflagration that looms as this article goes to press . Unlike Egypt and Saudi Arabia , which emerge from the conflict compromised by their alliance with the United States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflects the popular consensus in the Middle East : Oppose Iraq 's aggression , but denounce U.S. intervention in the gulf . Like Egypt , Iran is a large country , with a population estimated at fifty million and a history of exercising both power and cultural influence . Unlike Egypt , though , Iran is a rich , oil-producing country . While other nations become enmeshed in a costly war , Iran is rearming and reorganizing its military . <p> The sheikhs have already responded to Iran 's re-emergence as a regional force . In January , while sitting in the UN Delegates ' Lounge , I observed how eagerly representatives of the United Arab Emirates , Qatar , and Bahrain greeted their Iranian counterparts . A year ago , relations were so hostile they barely exchanged stares . But the center of power was already shifting ; last December , the Gulf Cooperation Council , a policy-planning body of Arab gulf states , from which even Arab Iraq was excluded , invited Iran to attend its annual meeting . <p> In order to comprehend how it might be possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must understand the contemporary Arab predicament . For Arabs , the possibility of war comes in an era of grief and humiliation . Never before has this people experienced such a combination of wealth and weakness , material resources and moral bankruptcy . In an era of decolonization , Arabs are subject to conquests and colonization . ( Since the end of World War II , five Arab countries  --  Palestine , Jordan , Syria , Lebanon , and Egypt  --  lost all or part of their territory to Israel . Egypt was able to regain the Sinai , but only at the cost of betraying its neighbors . ) <p> Through these years , the Arab yearning for a unifying ideology has been squelched but not extinguished . People 's identities , as members of tribes , craft guilds , religious sects , or ethnic groupings , had been mediated historically by the universal ideal of Islam . The decline of Muslim empires gave rise to secular nationalism , or Arabism . But the West opposed Arabism because it envisaged Arab unity and Arab control of Arab resources . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1967 and Egypt 's separate peace with Israel in 1978 , nearly destroyed secular nationalism as a motivating ideology in the region . Saddam Hussein , who presides over a secular polity , was trying to revive it . <p> But today , Arabism is a spent force . People are turning to Islam , of which Iran is now the standard bearer . In countries throughout the region , including Egypt and Saudi Arabia , the most powerful voices of opposition to U.S. military intervention are Islamic . Among these is one of Saudi Arabia 's most important religious leaders , Sheikh Safar alHalawi , who has vigorously denounced the deployment , alleging that Washington seeks to control the gulf in order to control its oil and gain leverage over western Europe , Japan , and the Third World . His taped speeches are circulating throughout the region , much as Ayatollah Khomeini 's recordings once permeated the Middle East . <p> Even Saddam Hussein , Arabism 's opportunistic exponent , has turned in desperation to Islam . So , too , may the majority of Middle Eastern people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States should expect to stand alone , with Israel , for the crusades of the future . Isolation of the United States <p> IN LATE JANUARY , AS U.S. FORCES PREPARED to launch a ground attack on Kuwait and Iraq , it became even more difficult to imagine how the president 's stated war goals might be sustained without long-term U.S , military involvement in the region . <p> A newly appointed task force , headed by deputy national security adviser Robert Gates , has been charged with analyzing postwar concerns : the control of nuclear , chemical , and biological weapons , Israeli occupation of Arab lands , and disparities between rich and poor nations in the Middle East . But how can these issues be addressed meaningfully in the aftermath of a war that decimates Kuwait and Iraq , creates a power vacuum that Iran is poised to fill , and turns up the heat of Islamic outrage at the United States and its allies ? <p> To an extent not recognized here , even pro-western moderates in the region now believe that Washington 's war aim all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East . For Arab allies participating in the attack on Iraq , this widespread perception carries with it the threat of mass revolt . <p> One sobering example of explosive danger for U.S. policy is the split liable to develop among the allies , after the war , on the question of nuclear weapons . The Bush administration offered as a key justification for its invasion the need to destroy Iraq 's alleged nuclear capability . But , of course , in the Middle East and south Asia , Israel alone possesses a formidable nuclear arsenal , conservatively estimated to contain between one hundred and two hundred high-density nuclear bombs . And the United States has resisted calls for making the Middle East a nuclear-free zone . <p> Special treatment for Israel may , in the end , break up the alliance . For twenty years , the United States has supported Israeli occupation and annexation of Arab lands , condoned violations of the United Nations Charter , ignored reports by Amnesty International , and vetoed UN Security Council resolutions condemning Israel 's violations of international law . Saddam Hussein 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Israeli militaries to stand together , and this response , for masses of Arabs , underscores the fact that another nuclear giant stands behind Israel to ensure not only its survival but its conquests . <p> After the United States has blasted Baghdad into submission , when the guns are finally silent , millions will mourn the dead and walk the ruins , knowing that a nuclear power next door remains the only country in the region without declared borders . It is difficult to imagine a greater incentive for a grand jihad . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : An eight-year war between Iraq and Iran cost one million lives . <p> By Eqbal Ahmad <p> <p> Eqbal Ahmad , writing fellow of the MacArthur Foundation 's Program on Peace and International Security , teaches at Hampshire College . <p>
