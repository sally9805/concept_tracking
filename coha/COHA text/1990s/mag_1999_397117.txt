Section : Humachines <p> The movements of the lanky man of the videotape mesh perfectly with the undulating rhythms and cascading tones that accompany his dance . As the music swells , his gestures grow pronounced and emphatic ; as the sound dwindles to the pulse of a synthesized bass or the flutter of an electronic clarinet , his motions diminish to the twitch of a hand or the slow weep of an arm . The choreographer , it seems , must have worked closely with the dancer and the composer to make such a seamless piece . The reality is more complex ; This dancer is , in fact , also choreographer and composer , choosing his moves on the fly while simultaneously making the music to match in a intimate collaboration with a video camera and a homemade computer system . <p> Sprawled shoeless on the living room floor in his Toronto home , 38-year-old David Rokeby watches the 28-year-old version of himself on a small TV set . Though his worn jeans , wire-rimmed glasses and only slightly scruffy hair make him look like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has instead become an internationally known interactive artist  --  his multimedia installations invite gallery goers and exhibition attendees to become active participants in the artistic process . <p> In language that shifts easily between the professorial and the poetic , Rokeby explains both the technology and the artistic intentions behind his work . In many ways , his career sounds like that of a researcher . Rokeby thinks of each of his installations as an experiment ; observing the hundreds of thousands of people who have participated with his pieces has given him an invaluable opportunity to learn about humans , machines and the very complicated relationships between them . <p> Through these artistic explorations , Rokeby has begun to understand how people 's interactions with computers change as technogadgetry becomes more and more common . And he has uncovered some ways that machines can subtly distort human perceptions . After years of investigating such ideas , Rokeby worries that our increasing interaction with the Internet and " intelligent " technologies might cause us to devalue some of the attributes that make us human . So while others work toward a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expose the quirks , foibles and rough edges of that relationship . " Because I 've programmed a lot , because I 've built computers , I know what it 's like to write a program and then watch people deal with it , and watch how my decisions change people 's experiences " says Rokeby . " For me , it 's important that I somehow articulate the importance of that act . " <p> Rokeby played the videotape of his dance on a sunny January afternoon to demonstrate his best-known project : Very Nervous System . The name is an umbrella term for an ongoing series of installations the project 's technological roots date back to some fiddling around with light sensors and a synthesizer that Rokeby did in the early 1980s . Over the years , Rokeby has used the technology behind Very Nervous System not only in his artistic endeavors , but also to support them ; reduced to its initials , VNS is an image-processing device he builds and sells to performers , composers , researchers and other artists . <p> What VNS does , essentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image into a digital signal . That signal can , via a Macintosh computer , drive electronic equipment such as synthesizers , video players and lights  --  all in real time . In a typical Very Nervous System installation , a body moving in the camera 's field of vision becomes an integral part of the work , triggering and modulating sounds or other effects . <p> Rokeby develops software and hardware for projects such as Very Nervous System with little outside help , and no formal technical training . As a teenager growing up in southern Ontario in the 1970s , he taught himself programming in order to indulge a fascination with electronic music and computer graphics . At 19 , with an offer on the table for a lucrative but uninspiring job in data processing , Rokeby instead embarked on a " five-year plan "  --  he would focus on the things that interested him and avoid those that " smacked of career . " If it did n't work out , he figured , he could always go back to school and get a computer science degree . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost five years to the day after he hatched his plan , Rokeby received an invitation to show his work at the Venice Biennale , arguably the world 's premier art show . The list of his artistic honors has grown steadily since . <p> Rokeby is n't the only artist exploring the gray area between the body , the mind and the computer ( ' see " Virtual Plants , " p. 62 ) , but he began doing this kind of interactive work long before most of the other artists currently on the scene , says Finnish media scholar Erkki Huhtamo , a visiting professor in the department of design at the University of California , Los Angeles . What 's more , Huhtamo says , Rokeby is one of few to have constructed his own technological tools . " He 's wonderfully capable of doing that , " says Huhtamo , " but on the other side he has applied those tools for various artworks  --  a career that combines these two sides meaningfully and interestingly is rather rare . " <p> Virtuosity in both technology and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways people relate to machines . Audiences of the early installations , shown at a time before many people used much computing power outside arcade video games , were " more open to the raw experience , " Rokeby recalls . They focused on the physical , and felt as though they were bumping into invisible objects that made noise . As time went on , though , people became more interested in the " geewhiz " technical aspects of the installations , and in tying the experience into a rapidly expanding computer culture . <p> But even as PCs became ubiquitous and " virtual reality " and " interactive media " attained buzzword status , there was an ecstatic quality to how people reacted to the piece . " Very Nervous System is very exciting , " Rokeby says . " To show it is very satisfying on a certain level because people love it , and come up to you and tell you that it 's brilliant and fabulous and it has changed their way of looking at something . " But Rokeby began to worry that his work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the real-time physical experience that they were n't stopping to ask the questions he had hoped they would : " ' What happened between me and the machine ? What does that mean for my relationship with my word processor ? ' " <p> To Rokeby , the answers to these questions have implications far beyond artistic concerns . He noticed that people tended to credit Very Nervous System with more than its fair share of responsibility for certain effects ; they might , for example , synchronize their movements unconsciously to a particular preprogrammed rhythm in the mix but believe it was the technology that adjusted to them . <p> " Given people 's general sense that machines are very smart , " Rokeby says , " they have a strong tendency to attribute the smarts to the machine , even if it 's their own smarts reflected back . " Rokeby believes that as interactive technologies , particularly the Internet , begin to play a central role in communications , commerce and civic activities , " the sense of where the control is and where the intelligence is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> To get away from the distracting excitement of Very Nervous System , in the 1990s Rokeby began working on pieces that were less physical and lacked the frenzied feedback between audience and computer . In 1995 , he started showing a piece that turned his early installations inside out , giving audiences the chance to watch the computer 's image-processing operation as it happened and to see what the machine had been seeing for all those years . " One of the things that was always weird about Very Nervous System , " Rokeby says , " is that it is a surveillance system , but no one ever felt threatened by it  --  people did n't feel like they were being watched . " <p> So in Watch , Rokeby created an overtly voyeuristic experience . Video projectors shine two images side-by-side , each a processed version of a surveillance camera 's view of a nearby public space . In Very Nervous System , the computer extracts motion from a video signal by comparing one frame with the last and determining which pixels have changed , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ techniques used in Watch are a dissection of VNS 's internal workings . On one side only the things that are moving show up , white ghosts gliding through a black void ; the other side shows only what 's still , a seemingly normal but frozen black-and-white video image . <p> To these images , Rokeby adds a soundtrack : The occasional noise of a camera shutter or electronic beeping interrupts soft hypnotic sounds of breathing , a heartbeat and a ticking clock . It 's a reminder , Rokeby says , that there might be something wrong with spying on people in this way . <p> Watch also serves as a reminder of how different the world can look when seen through varying technological lenses . In the early days of developing the piece , Rokeby aimed the camera out his studio window at a busy intersection . The two different video filters  --  one catching motion , the other stasis  --  became socioeconomic filters : In one image , members of a vibrant crowd moved swiftly about their business , in the other , panhandlers appeared to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again draws from art a lesson about the impact of technology on our perceptions . The image-filtering techniques he employs in Watch are very similar to those used to compress video for storage or transmission . ( Programmers save digital space by recording or sending only the changing pixels in successive frames of a moving image . ) The more we use such techniques in daily life , he says , the more we wear inherently biased lenses . Rokeby says he is particularly concerned by the large number of design decisions being made " by programmers in startup companies working on intense deadlines , with very little experience of philosophy and politics . " <p> Though the insights rokeby has gained through his art may put him in a better position to make such programming decisions , he has no desire to tie himself to his own startup company . He builds and sells only a few VNS units a year , though many more people would like to get their hands on one , according to Todd Winkler , a music professor at Brown University . " In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and people talk about it , want to learn about it all the time " says Winkler , who has used his own VNS setup for more than three years in installations , performances and demonstrations . Still , Winkler understands Rokeby 's decision to focus primarily on art rather than commerce . " Getting into the business of making little metal boxes that everybody in the world wants could really consume you completely , " Winkler says . <p> On the contrary , what is consuming Rokeby these days is his latest project , The Giver of Names . It 's a concept that came to the artist almost instantaneously on the day after his birthday in 1990 . " The idea was there would be a computer and objects and you could present the objects to the computer and it would talk about them , " he recounts . Realizing this seemingly straightforward notion , however , has taken the better part of the decade . <p> Part of the motivation behind The Giver of Names was what Rokeby , perhaps presciently , saw as a shift in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an e-mail quoted in the catalogue for the 1998 premiere of The Giver of Names , in the 1980s it was the body that was " most challenged by the computer . ... In the ' 90s it seems to be the notions of intelligence , and consciousness . " <p> Rokeby worries that as we grow accustomed to such phenomena as intelligent agents on the Internet and computerized phone systems , we may devalue certain human attributes . To talk to that computerized receptionist , for example , we often have to exaggerate and mechanize our speech  --  the change in enunciation is a " subtle dumbing-down process . " So rather than trying to make The Giver of Names a flawless facsimile of human thought , Rokeby wanted to leave it rough , exposing the " quirky textures " of a strictly mechanical intelligence rather than using clever programming to paper them over . <p> In action , The Giver of Names is quirky indeed . The installation space is spare : A video camera aims at a black pedestal around which a variety of objects are strewn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can select objects from the pile , or items they 've brought with them , and arrange them on the pedestal ; the computer captures an image and processes it , identifying colors , outlines and shapes . The system then begins a mechanical version of free-association , pulling up words that are somehow connected to the details culled from the image . The Giver of Names ' " state of mind " in this process is a relational database of 100,000 objects , words and ideas . <p> An object on the pedestal , Rokeby explains , " is like a pebble dropped in a pond of memory , and the associations are like ripples moving away from the initial object and exciting or stimulating different parts of the memory . " The words most " stimulated " in this process become the palette from which the computer chooses in forming sentences that appear on the computer screen . At the same time , male and female voices fill the installation space as they utter the words . <p> Presented with a soda bottle and an apple , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the apple and the shape of the bottle  --  these would probably stimulate the word " wine , " among others , says Rokeby . " As for the sentence , it could be anything from ' The wine spilled ' to something completely off the wall like ' Red aliens from inner cities flopped sumptuously on the wine-stained sofa . ' " <p> Early on , The Giver of Names tended to talk about war . The system 's fixation on generals and grenades prompted Rokeby to consider the fact that many of the databases he used were developed for military-sponsored artificial intelligence and natural-language processing research . " It 's kind of interesting , " he says , that the tools " used to train artificial intelligences about language will inevitably have a strong defense bias , because the best resources right now were funded by the Defense Department . " <p> Rokeby is the first to admit that such specific lessons are n't likely to be obvious in his artworks , that most people wo n't listen to The Giver of Names talking about a piece of fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the effects of military funding on the future of artificial intelligence . " But by seeing ourselves in collusion with and in contrast to the mechanical perceiving , thinking and speaking systems that Rokeby builds , we can all begin to think about , as he puts it , " how much of what we do is basically mechanical and how much of what we do does imply something richer and more complicated . " And Rokeby takes great satisfaction in the unique intensity with which interactive art allows him to communicate such ideas . Not everyone gets the point of each installation , he says , " but when they get it , boy do they get it . " <p> By Rebecca Zacks <p> VIRTUAL PLANTS AND OTHER ( ONLINE ) CREATURES <p> Though David Rokeby and other artists who create interactive installations are starting to gain a foothold in the mainstream art world , it 's still unlikely that you 'll be able to find their work at a museum near you . You can , however , readily find these folks on the Internet , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sites that are well worth exploring . Here 's a small sample of what 's out there : <p> Rokeby himself provides an extensive catalogue of his pieces , along with some of his writings , at http : **27;459;TOOLONG . <p> Austrian-born Christa Sommerer and French-born Laurent Mignonneau teamed up in 1992 , and now work at the ATR Media Integration and Communications Research Laboratories in Kyoto , Japan . At their ATR Web site ( http : **28;488;TOOLONG ) you 'll find images from and explanations of the elaborate virtual ecosystems they 've created for installations and Web-based pieces . Sommerer and Mignonneau have built a number of unique viewer/machine interfaces : Audiences can create new plants or creatures and influence their behavior by drawing on touch screens , sending e-mail , moving through the installation space , and even by touching real plants wired to the computer . <p> Janine Cirincione and Michael Ferraro , both faculty members at New York 's School of Visual Arts , founded their design studio , Possible Worlds , in 1992 .
