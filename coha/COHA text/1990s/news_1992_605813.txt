<p> IN 1886 , while chronicling the peculiarly North American practice of maple sugaring , Englishman John Burroughs wrote : " A sap-run is the sweet good-by of winter . It is the fruit of the equal marriage of the sun and frost . " <p> What a bit of magic it must have seemed to the American Indians and early settlers  --  just at the time of year the long , difficult winter began to soften and there was an encouraging hint of spring in the air , trees began to produce that delightful sweet juice . <p> Native Americans in what is now New England discovered the phenomenon of sap-running . They called the coming of spring " maple moon " and celebrated with festivals , something that modern Americans do , too . Maple festivals are common in New England and Pennsylvania , and there are even a few in Maryland and Virginia , most of them within a three- to four-hour drive of the Beltway . <p> Sap circulates only under certain external conditions . The days must be sunny and warm enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frozen roots . The nights must be cold enough to ensure that the sap will return to the tree 's roots at night instead of flowing out to the branches to feed the buds . <p> When nights warm sufficiently for the buds to appear on the sugar maple , it is said the good sugaring weather is over . Syrup produced after that is not of the highest quality and is sometimes called " buddy . " . <p> Indian children learned to lick the bark around cuts in the tree . Indians found that the syrup tasted even better when they boiled the water off by throwing hot stones into birchbark logs filled with sap or cooking it in clay pots over a fire . <p> Kathy Kinter , an environmentalist at Pennsylvania 's Lancaster County Central Park , says the Abenaki in New England and Canada believed the Creator put maple syrup into the trees and it just poured out , pure and sweet . Then Gluscabi , an old man in the tribe , wanting to be sure the Indians would not become lazy , climbed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which caused the syrup to turn to sap , making the process of syrup-making more complicated . <p> Beth Allen , storyteller and folklorist for Chester County , Pa. , tells an Algonquin tale about sugaring . A man , Woksis , had tapped a tree and gone out hunting . His wife , Moqua , started to prepare their meal when she tipped over a vessel of water she needed . So , being resourceful , she gathered sap from a nearby tree to cook his meat . Not only was Woksis happy about the sweet taste of his dinner , Moqua discovered sand-like maple sugar while she was cleaning out the pot . <p> Early American settlers followed Moqua 's lead . After boiling the sap to the point of syrup , they continued to boil it until it grained and became blocks of maple sugar . Colonists used the brown maple sugar for every day , saving the harder-to-get white cane sugar for special occasions . Children would pour pure , hot maple syrup on fresh snow . It immediately made a soft , natural candy that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a snack , too , according to Allen . They cooked and mashed corn before mixing it with beef jerky and maple syrup to produce what was probably the first trail mix , she says . <p> Today trees are tapped by drilling a two-inch-deep hole at a slight upward angle , then inserting a spout , or spile , for the sap to drip through . A bucket with a handle is hung over the spile . Sap can be collected in any type of container . In the 19th century , buckets were sometimes made of cedar and white ash because those woods would n't alter the taste of the syrup . Metal , and later , plastic buckets became popular , and finally , for large amounts of sap , tubing that stretches from tree to tree . <p> Over the next few weekends your family can pile in the car and visit the maple festivals that sprout like buds on a tree .

" Most of the demonstrations show just how the Ingalls family of " Little House on the Prairie " fame gathered their sap and made their sugar in Wisconsin in the 19th century . <p> j Spend a day in the nippy out-of-doors while exposing the kids to an old-time art that uses only what nature has given us . <p> j Buy and eat some real maple syrup .
