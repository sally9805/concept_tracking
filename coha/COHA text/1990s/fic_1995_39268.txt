THE WANDERING STORY BEGINS in the mid-1800s in Russia with a gathering of young men , nobles of some sort , at a comfortable club of their provision in a provincial town miles from the social authority of Moscow . One senses the author 's habitual questioning of the entrenched habits of power or of what passes for it in such centers as Moscow , and there seems , tacitly , the thought that such concentrations are even more closed in upon themselves than are the smaller societies of those cities and towns more remote from such confident hubs . There is also the wondering disposition of an author on the edge of the late nineteenth century in Europe , hardly a moment of significant stability even if peculiarly hushed , muted by a curious containment of impulse , a waiting for a je ne sais quoi of whatever fact . <p> I had told the story any number of times , wondering how it had been so poised , first of all , how he 'd thought of it . These reflective , reflexive moments would seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of . How come it 's that way , etc . Dazzling . <p> But on this evening , which memory does not now describe except that it feels cold , fragile , one of the company has discovered himself as destitute , having lost at cards or some similar adventure all of his land and money . Why he has come to the club at all one may wonder , because he now becomes the butt of his fellows , who face him with increasingly sneering contempt and dismissal . All but one , that is , for the unfortunate bankrupt has not merely a champion but a stalwart friend , who steps forward to defend his vulnerable fellow and abruptly offers him the resources of his own estate , proposing they leave the surly company and go there at once . <p> This time he had contrived to gather us in a usefully unfamiliar place , the small town ambience of clustered nobility , or at least money . Yet one in the company was broke and all the others picked on him mercilessly , no doubt to break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if one would have to break a way through , just to get into the building . <p> What is time in such worlds ? Only the next moment , or else a vast plain of almost undifferentiated accumulation , days , years , centuries , until all moves with an oozing solidity . It is the place of cause and effect but of such scale that an eyeblink resonates for endless hours and effects such a plethora of absolutely unthinkable results . " For want of a nail , a shoe was lost .... " Is it truly just the mind which thinks of things ? Nonetheless our story continues . <p> At this moment , then , another young man there , much as all , stands up and abruptly defends the indigent person , the bankrupt , saying that he now constitutes the erstwhile victim 's support . What does he say exactly ? Something like , come home with me , your troubles are over . <p> One thing settled , another soon begins . So the friend brought home and given a securing place quickly became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drama , which , one soon learns , is a complex but painfully vivid rapprochement with one of the household 's maids . This forthright person is an exceptionally handsome young woman who has but lately come into service and so feels no limiting habit of wary self-abasement . She is , in that sense , naive , yet not in the least unintelligent . The young man feels her equal to himself in every way , if not beyond him , in fact , in the capability of her independent manner of thinking . <p> But " there " there is no one one knows , no locating warmth or answer . She speaks from quite elsewhere , this familiar and final friend . She is not ever one or two or three . She does not divide by evens and odds . The kaleidoscopic manifestations might just as well be the fingers of one 's hands . What does one feel ? <p> No doubt there was a time when all of us , perhaps , were poised upon our own capabilities with just such a freshness , speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or thinking to , how we might be heard . Then we were truly lovely , endearing , utterly human in our unintentional pretensions of a world of such openness . Even the clouds might speak clearly . <p> Impatient with all conversions of love , indifferent to whatever they have been implicated to mean , he will not see beyond the enclosing tunnels of his own various intentions , his plans for immediate action . He surveys his rested body as if it were a machine , well oiled , well designed , well equipped for the tasks he has in mind to give it . <p> Now , however , complications occur which have not been anticipated . There is much discussion with the ensconced friend , who has become the ear for all such ruminations , but neither can quite understand what has happened . The love was fierce , direct and passionate . The two had met whenever able to , fell directly upon each other as massive stones weighted by an irrevocable destiny . They both were seemingly in a state of profound and absolute love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be , in fact , its definition , that it was finally , if uncomfortably , everywhere one was . No high roads or low roads to lead elsewhere . He has followed the wrong career , so to speak . He might have been a highly proficient opera star or a bowler , taken in the washing or counted sheep . He looked only to the other for resolutions . Where was he ? <p> Yet what had so attracted him to her  --  her remarkable clarity , her determined integrity of feeling  --  now rebuffs him . She has thought of all that living which her love for him must necessarily preclude , all that might otherwise happen which she will never know now , because of him . Many persons have experienced the consternation of love 's obstinate enclosure , yet few have turned away because they would not accept such transforming delight as sufficient . So she is humble in such questioning , but she knows that a life simply with him must argue against the vast potential she senses it might otherwise prove . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves him nonetheless . Instantly all his life becomes a vapid emptiness . <p> It seems much like crying in a graveyard , for the loss of a loved one . The very magnitude of grief , the densities of despair , the profoundly grounded shock of absences noted so repetitively must mean that one is one of many , as was the one now gone also . I can not believe you call me back just to tell me that , so often , so expectedly , with nothing ever added . <p> You must enter this moment as closely as possible in that no time will now separate you , no other place be so far from you , that this heartbreaking confusion , this insistently destructive turn of events , will not prove familiar . When one leaves , one leaves forever , be it by fact of death , or love 's absence , or a simple misunderstanding one only recognizes as such too late . With love so lost , one 's self is no more than a painful reflection , an abhorrent survival of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt . " If she be not fair for me , what care I how fair she be ... " There are certainly other dispositions in this matter . Yet they are not ours particularly , not after such a long life with so many habits in it . Triangulation sometimes sounds at least like strangulation . What a sight to see she was . You too . <p> He himself wanders , almost crazed , from tavern to tavern , village to village , and soon becomes a peculiar presence of that vast tapestry of small towns and rivers , those echoing hills and valleys , the tenacious , small presences of the local , the enduring provincial fabric of place . One day he comes upon a horse fair and watches , half distracted by his manic preoccupation , while an old horse dealer , a Jew , is set upon by irate yokels who think he has cheated them with his close dealing . Defensively the trader prepares for their attack , which is unfortunately soon coming . The frustrated crowd now batters against him with fists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew old and died , literally . It is the simple reality of the story that engages one 's attention . Coming into the house , one knows where things are . One follows after , concerned that our friend may do himself some real harm , now that the old companion he had rescued earlier has gone , and also the vivid love who had burned his heart so deeply . I like the looks of the old horse trader , come in from some other tale no doubt , a familiar figure in these times . He knows far more than he finds reason to speak of . Trust him . <p> A complex sense of fairness and the same unthinking ability to respond again prompt the young man to act . Instantly he has thrust himself forward , into the surly crowd 's most volatile numbers , and here he pushes one , then another , calling upon them to stand back and stop their harassing of this innocent old man . Possibly it is his own fierceness now persuades them for they hesitate , confused by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin to slink off as he continues to shout at them , the trader at his side . <p> All the meannesses , the meagernesses , the pinched , small avoidances I had thought swept behind me here recollect . " Do I have perchance a debt to a man named ... " Most echoing the gray morning we awoke to find ourselves entangled against affectation or loyalty , struck again by the world 's defensive patterns . Do you remember how the boys feed bread with a fish hook in it to that old dog who waits each day for them as they pass on their way to and from school ? I think of you across the long years still waiting , etc . <p> Expectably the one he has rescued is grateful indeed . Who can say what his actual conduct has been ? In this close world such an outsider must of necessity be suspect and that generality itself no doubt serves to prompt a behavior unlike the common . Shrewdly he considers his benefactor even as isolated as himself . He must sense that for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the singularity of his own life . Almost with foresight the trader thanks the younger man with the gift of one of his horses , a magnificent gray stallion , a dream of compact energies and astute breeding . It is his prophetic thanks for the wonder of their meeting , just in time . <p> There are no parallels , there are only repetitions . Off I ride on my cousin 's half-horselike gray pony across the farmer 's fields where the cows feed under the apple trees . They startle to see us come at them and begin themselves to run , some dragging tether ropes and chains . Vive le peuple ! There are so many stories still to tell . <p> So a new chapter begins , so to speak , and our hero is utterly possessed by his miraculous steed . Noble visitors to that remote landscape , themselves out riding to dispel the tedium , confront an unexpected arc of speed across their prospect , a rush of thundering hooves which carry the concentrated owner past them in a blur . All attempts to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horseflesh , fail . It is adamantly not for sale . Days now pass in the rigorous routine of the horse 's care and exercise . The obsessed owner all but lives in the stable except for those hours he spends in the saddle , pounding over the expansive wastes of valley and hill . <p> Yet when he had finally bought the stupid car and managed to get it back to his house without incident , he then tried to secure it within the far too small garage only to mistake controls in the process and so lumbered on through the rear end of the flimsy building out into the backyard where his vague companion stood hanging sheets , amazed . Together they watched an angel descend with gauzy wings and a severely sunburned forehead , impatient that their faith required its attendance when all else in the universe was so markedly more attractive . The dogs , meantime , sat on the sidewalk and laughed . <p> But then , one morning , he goes in usual fashion to attend his magnificent steed only to find it gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Surely there must be a comforting explanation . Slowly , despairingly , he recognizes that the horse has been stolen , which has for many days been even unthinkable , yet nonetheless present in the back of his mind because of the intense and persistent interest in acquiring the horse all had shown . He tears at his body and clothing in anger . He confronts with rage all his staff . How has the horse been so let loose , in care and now in fact ? His despair becomes absolute as he ranges far and wide , asking questions of all he meets but never finding even a wisp of evidence as to the horse 's whereabouts . He applies to the old trader for advice but the man can only say that he will put out the word and report such findings as come of it . <p> No one ever said it could work out . You pay your money and you take your choice . Would it be better never to step outside the house . There are people who live whole lifetimes together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak , just write little notes like , " I am going to the doctor 's , " or " The upstairs toilet has backed up . " The small voice hardly of conscience says silently I love your big fat tits , your huge penis , but then I have little say in these matters . Those are unseemly thoughts at best . Think of the one that got away . <p> If the end of things were as expected , then the story would itself wander off , past the interval of initial friendship , the transforming love then following to lead him elsewhere , the sudden truncation of all he had thus come to look to , and then an old and vulnerable horse trader and the gift of the wondrous horse , then its loss , and thus the end . Many years have passed and that friend first met in all his vulnerability has long since died . The woman too may well be a grandmother . But this is quite another tale and so one day the old trader comes to the man 's house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By means of his extensive fellows in the trade the gray horse had been recovered and now all might be as before . <p> Maybe Lazarus would have preferred to let things be , however grateful he was reported as being . The stories of that book are finally buried under the apparent doctrine , which is , as all such , there to make a point . If it were the keys to the car , then welcome always their recovery . Yet if blame were to follow ? I have nothing more to say on the grounds that it may tend to incriminate me . What sort of writer could that be . <p> The routine again begins , the procedures of the stable , the long rides over the adjoining estates and woods , and life returns almost as if the blood came back into a body . Daily he feels himself blessed by a bounty no human can ever feel deserved . Then a simple question comes , almost as if it too were a wanderer , a traveler from some distant place prompted by no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A neighbor , well meaning , one morning had asked him if he were finally certain that this was the horse which had been stolen from him . Of course , he said , how could it be otherwise ? The horse so performed , the color of its coat was just the right shade of gray  --  what could be suspected as different ? But , said the man , it is a well-known fact that a young gray will show a distinct change of shading in that color after its yearly shedding . Is that so , he felt , and how could it be that he had not thought of it , having thought of everything else imaginable ? So , the reasoning went , if this horse is just that gray you remember , then it can not be your horse since that gray would now be not the same . But it was , of course , his horse . Who should know better ? No one , at last he had to realize . Now no one will ever know at all . <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the words of another person , an Englishwoman whose son then came to live in the house of one of my wife 's elder relatives , wherein both were eventually to die without the reminiscences one might well have hoped to have heard . Possibly the son 's being a writer argued the necessity of some other thing to say , some requisite distance . Our author speaks of none of them . But the mother 's sensitive listening had made his initiating words carry a formidable distance , like the faded country squire upon the great gray horse 's back . I may wonder why she thought to break it into two halves , like a cookie , but what after all do I know of her , except that she too cares ? The green trees grow more slowly . The river winds on . <p> Waldoboro , Maine 16 August 1992 <p>
