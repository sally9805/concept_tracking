<p> To Defense Secretary William S. Cohen , Rose Gottemoeller once seemed like a promising nominee for the top Pentagon position with daily responsibility for U.S. policy on nuclear weapons . The former Clinton aide specialized in Russian and arms control matters , had new ideas and was highly regarded by the White House . <p> Cohen offered her the job last April and pledged to send her nomination papers to the Senate by September . But on Aug. 6  --  after she had given notice to her employers at a London think tank and just one week before moving vans were to arrive at her home  --  a top aide to Cohen telephoned to say the offer had been withdrawn because Cohen had decided to abolish the position . <p> Word of Cohen 's decision has caused officials at the Pentagon and other security agencies to question the direction of administration policy , partly because the post , assistant secretary for international security policy , is responsible for what advocates say are some of the most urgent issues in the post-Cold War period : stopping proliferation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclear threats . <p> But discussion has also focused on whether Cohen withdrew his offer to Gottemoeller less for administrative reasons than for political ones . Some officials inside and outside the Pentagon say he was motivated in large measure by concern that her endorsement of a report advocating new arms control measures would have unduly complicated her Senate confirmation , opening a fight over the future of U.S. nuclear policy that the Clinton administration does not want to wage . <p> Before Gottemoeller 's job offer was retracted , she was loudly criticized by Frank Gaffney , a conservative Republican activist and former Pentagon official who says he speaks for conservatives inside the building . Gaffney left the Pentagon during the Bush administration in part , he says , because he had been denied a chance to fill the same post for which Gottemoeller had been selected and because he opposed a draft treaty requiring the elimination of theater , or medium-range , nuclear weapons . <p> On July 12 , three weeks before Cohen 's decision , Gaffney , who runs a small outfit here called the Center for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas about nuclear weapons policy " deplorable . " It particularly attacked her for supporting the administration 's policy of maintaining the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty , which Gaffney has long opposed . <p> Gottemoeller 's fate , some current and former Pentagon and White House officials say , is evidence of the reluctance of the Defense Department and Clinton 's top White House aides to make waves on military or nuclear arms issues during Clinton 's second term . Arms reductions traditionally have not been been possible without support from inside the Pentagon . <p> Gottemoeller 's supporters also say it illustrates the perils of accepting a job from an administration that is occasionally reluctant to stand by candidates at risk of running into political trouble  --  such as Lani Guinier , who was withdrawn in 1993 as a candidate for assistant attorney general , and Air Force Gen. Joseph W. Ralston , whose candidacy for chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was withdrawn this summer . <p> The report endorsed by Gottemoeller was issued June 17 by a 16-member committee of the National Academy of Sciences ( NAS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocated immediately pursuing steep new cuts in the U.S. nuclear arsenal , down to 1,000 weapons on each side in the near term and eventually to a few hundred  --  a viewpoint at odds with the administration 's policy , which would delay negotiations of any reductions until the Russian parliament ratifies the START II treaty . That January 1993 accord would establish a ceiling of roughly 3,500 deployed warheads while allowing thousands of additional arms to be kept in storage . <p> The report also urged other measures  --  such as a nuclear-free zone in Europe and a policy of " no first use " of nuclear arms  --  that the authors claimed would ease tensions with Russia and reduce the risk of war . The United States and Russia each have more than 10,000 nuclear weapons and have not conducted bilateral negotiations on the issue for five years . <p> Gottemoeller 's endorsement had not aroused controversy on Capitol Hill . But several officials familiar with the matter said Gaffney 's critique raised the prospects of a fight that Cohen , a former Republican senator , hoped to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including national security adviser Samuel R. " Sandy " Berger and his counterpart on Vice President Gore 's staff , Leon S. Fuerth , spoke up for Gottemoeller but declined to try to force the appointment . <p> " This is an administration that puts lunch money in the bully 's locker even before being threatened , " said one of Gottemoeller 's close friends , who is on good terms with senior officials at the White House and the Pentagon . <p> In an interview , Gottemoeller , 43 , said she was surprised and frustrated by Cohen 's decision . She said that even though the decision was explained to her as a consequence of downsizing the Pentagon staff , " I really do n't understand why they decided to make the offer in the first place if they were eventually going to eliminate " the post . <p> She also defended the NAS report , describing it as a sober " look forward . . . at what needs to be done " before the United States and other nuclear powers can seriously pursue extremely low nuclear limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views expressed in the report " are very widely held in the arms control community , not only in the United States but in Russia and elsewhere , " she said . <p> When asked to explain Cohen 's decision , Pentagon officials offered conflicting accounts . Spokeswoman Susan Hansen said Cohen had not decided to abolish any senior policy jobs  --  a statement at odds with what Gottemoeller said she was told by Undersecretary of Defense Walter Slocombe and chief of staff Robert Tyrer . " There have been no organizational changes in OSD Office of the Secretary of Defense policy as we speak , " Hansen said last Friday , partly because a detailed study of possible reforms in the Pentagon bureaucracy is not scheduled to be finished until November . <p> But Cohen 's spokesman Kenneth Bacon later said the offer was indeed withdrawn because Cohen had concluded " in principle , although it is not quite nailed down " that he wants to abolish the job as part of an overall consolidation of his office . <p> " This was done purely for organizational reasons , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since last fall and that it was preferable to leave the job open while a final reorganization plan was being worked out . Asked why Cohen waited to make his views known , he said the secretary had been distracted by other matters this spring and " the thinking crystallized over time . " <p> He said further that " our commitment to nuclear arms reduction is clear , from the top of the administration on down , " although " obviously we have to wait " until the START II treaty is ratified in Russia . <p> But three other senior Pentagon officials and two former officials , who all asked not to be identified , contradicted Bacon 's account . Each said Gaffney 's criticism of Gottemoeller had played a major role in deliberations among top Cohen aides that led to the withdrawal . " As people began looking through the NAS report , they began to think that Gaffney 's criticism had some potential . . . to stir up trouble , " one of the officials said . " There was some real concern . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against a global treaty banning chemical arms , said that if the offer had indeed been withdrawn , " I would like to think it 's a function in part . . . of some of the views we were expressing " about Gottemoeller . Gaffney said he had written the critique himself but that he also had some " help from a number of people " inside the Pentagon , including several he said were former colleagues from the Bush administration . He did not say who they were . <p> Gaffney confirmed that his group receives contributions from Pentagon contractors who currently manage nuclear weapons facilities or build weapons that carry nuclear warheads , but he said the funds did not influence his statement and that his opposition to the abolition of nuclear arms or treaties mandating deep cuts is longstanding . <p> Gaffney said further that he had expected his critique would resonate with at least two conservatives on the Armed Services Committee , Sens . Robert C. Smith ( R-N.H. ) and James M. Inhofe ( R-Okla. ) , although " I do n't even know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Legislative aides to the two senators each said they vaguely recalled receiving Gaffney 's fax but said their bosses had not raised any concern about Gottemoeller with the Pentagon . <p> Cohen was aware of the Gaffney fax at the time he made his decision , said a senior aide . " I 'm not trying to pretend that this thing was not a consideration , " the aide said . It was " just not that big a deal " relative to the need for downsizing and Cohen 's desire to avoid an extensive delay . <p> Gottemoeller , a scholar in Russian linguistics and science policy from Georgetown and George Washington universities who has been working in London at the International Institute for Strategic Studies , would have been the first woman to become an assistant secretary responsible for defense policy . From 1993 to 1994 , she served as a director for Russian , Ukrainian and Eurasian affairs at the National Security Council , after being appointed in part at the recommendation of Madeleine K. Albright , who was then directing the council 's transition team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Yorker magazine that was published Aug. 18 , was reported as having " emphatically " affirmed his commitment to Gottemoeller 's selection  --  a position he also enunciated to friends in late July . He further told the magazine of his support for reducing nuclear arms " to the point where we do n't have them "  --  a goal the NAS panel also said was worth exploring . <p> When Slocombe informed Gottemoeller on Aug. 6 that the post would be eliminated , he offered her a lower-ranking job at the Pentagon , which he said would still be responsible for Russian-related matters but would have no responsibility for nuclear weapons policy . It also would not be subject to Senate confirmation . <p> Gottemoeller said she declined the offer because " the roller-coaster ride . . . would have made it difficult to develop a sociable and confident working relationship " with senior Pentagon officials . <p> John Steinbruner , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who served on the NAS panel , said that " across a wide spectrum of opinion , this is considered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have helped the administration make some progress on nuclear reductions after a five-year hiatus . " We need a great deal more than has been coming out of the Pentagon , " he said , adding that the withdrawal of the appointment signaled " a circling of the wagons by the inside nuclear priesthood . " <p> Fred Ikle , the undersecretary of defense for policy during the Reagan administration , said he thought Gaffney 's critique was unfair and that he too opposed abolishing the position because " the person who deals with these matters . . . is in one of the most important positions in the Pentagon . It deals with the most fearsome threat to our survival . " <p> CORRECTION-DATE : September 24 , 1997 <p> CORRECTION : An article yesterday incorrectly described the period in which Frank Gaffney , a Republican activist and former Pentagon official , left his position at the Department of Defense . He stopped working at the Pentagon in 1987.
