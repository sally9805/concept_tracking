Lots of special teams NFL players bang heads for a living , but few , if any , can match Mike Morris as a head banger . The Vikings ' 291-pound long snapper is the league 's foremost exponent of heavy metal music . On the airwaves he copilots a weekly half-hour heavy metal radio revue , on KFAN in Minneapolis . In the weight room he listens to heavy metal while pumping heavy metal . His right biceps is even tattooed with the iron-eagle emblem of Judas Priest , the high priests of heavy metallurgy . Morris plans to honor his favorite offensive linemen by having their numbers branded into the bird 's purple plumage . " That 'll make it a gridiron eagle , " he says diabolically . " I 'll either mail each player a certificate or send him a chunk of my hide . " // Clearly this is one snapped snapper . Morris is , after all , a vagabond veteran who once , for a course at Northeast Missouri State , tape-recorded the sounds in a graveyard ( " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says ) ; who has hunted scorpions and rattlesnakes ; and who claims to have led his college teammates in a seance to revive the spirit of Truman Capote . " We never did pull Tru up , " Morris confides . " I guess we did n't have enough candles . " // Candles are about the only Elvirabilia missing from Morris 's locker . Among his cubby 's more ghoulish talismans are talking skulls , and plastic spiders , locusts and vampire bats . Straddling his Harley hog , Morris roars into the Viking practice facility immaculate in a black leather biker jacket , black steel-toed combat boots and a black T-shirt . He wears a different black T-shirt every day . " I collect them , " he more or less explains . He has more than 600 stashed in duffel bags at his home outside Minneapolis . " Black is my color , " Morris says , " but I bleed purple . " // Before Minnesota snapped him up in 1991 , eight pro teams had asked Morris to take a hike in eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on with another team as long as I fired strikes , " he says . " The key is to fire them every time , with as much zip as possible . " Morris has muffed only one snap in recent memory  --  two years ago at Pittsburgh in the rain . But he redeemed himself in the game 's closing minute with a perfect snap for the Central Division title-clinching field goal . // Not since Eric the Red has a Viking been so eager for battle . " When I go to training camp , " says Morris , " I go to war . " He took along 500 toy soldiers and encircled his bed with them . Every now and then his roomie , guard Randall McDaniel , would lob over a dirty sock and knock out a platoon . " It was carnage , " Morris reports . " Is anything worse than waking up to a bunch of troops with low morale ? " // Burdened by such cares , he finds solace in the Mike Morris Fan Club . During the season the organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pub in St. Cloud , Minn . When Morris takes the field either to make a snap or as a defender on kick-return coverage , everyone in the bar is required to stand . When he makes a tackle , they all get a shot of watermelon schnapps on the house . And if for some reason he should ever score , they will each be compelled to down a semilethal concoction called a snakebite . " Who knows what the hell 's in it , " Morris says . " I have no earthly idea . " // So what accounts for his skewed perspective ? Morris blames it on having spent much of his career as a snapper with his head between his legs . " You 'd be a little goofy too , " he reasons , " if your whole world was upside down . "
