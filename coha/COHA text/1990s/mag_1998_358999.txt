Even in the fang-baring world of Bill Clinton 's most dedicated pursuers , Larry Klayman is in a class by himself . In just four years as head of Judicial Watch , the nonprofit group he founded and operates , Klayman has filed 18 legal actions against the Clinton Administration . Once a relatively obscure trade lawyer , he now goes after anyone he thinks might know something , anything about the skulduggeries he feels sure the White House is behind . Making the most of the rules of pretrial discovery , Klayman has subpoenaed such past and present Clinton insiders as George Stephanopoulos and Paul Begala  --  as well as such bewildered small fry as Begala 's assistant  --  subjecting them to protracted depositions at which his questions are , to say the least , wide-ranging . ( He demanded that one recent target disclose the name of his cats . ) In his free time Klayman is also suing his mother , claiming she owes him $40,000 for nursing care he provided for his late grandmother . <P> His conspiracy spinning , together with his self-aggrandizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , other than God , for guidance and direction , " a recent fax proclaimed  --  has won him his share of attention in Washington , some of it puzzled , some mocking . In the online magazine Slate , Jacob Weisberg declares that " Klayman is off his rocker . " But at least one of Klayman 's early lines of pursuit has been picked up by independent counsel Kenneth Starr , a man who has faced , and faced down , more than a few complaints about his own investigative techniques . Last week Harold Ickes , the former White House deputy chief of staff , was brought before Starr 's grand jury to answer questions about how information from the supposedly confidential Pentagon personnel file of Linda Tripp , Starr 's chief witness , found its way into the press . <P> It was Klayman who led Starr to Ickes . ( Ickes , in fact , is the man whose cats Klayman wanted to know about . ) In March New Yorker writer Jane Mayer reported that in 1969 , at age 19 , Tripp was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later reduced . Mayer also noted that Tripp had not disclosed the arrest on her Pentagon security-clearance form , information that Mayer got from Pentagon public affairs chief Kenneth Bacon . Starr got to thinking about Ickes because of news accounts of a contentious six-hour deposition that Ickes underwent as part of a Judicial Watch lawsuit . In reply to one of Klayman 's many questions , Ickes said he and Bacon had once briefly talked about Tripp over a Chinese take-out dinner . <P> What Starr wants to know is whether anybody deliberately set out to compromise Tripp , his chief witness . Bacon and his deputy , Clifford Bernath  --  who were also deposed by Klayman , their depositions later subpoenaed by Starr  --  insist that the release of information about Tripp 's application , which violated the federal Privacy Act , was an innocent mistake , not an order from the White House . Klayman is pleased but nonchalant about shepherding at least one target into Starr 's line of fire . " Our goal , " he says , " is not to help any investigation other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
