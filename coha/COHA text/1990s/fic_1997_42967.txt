These are the lasting mansions of the dead ; The dead ! methinks a thousand tongues reply , These are the tombs of such as can not die . - George Crabbe , The Library <p> And , through all , I  --  wrote . - Edgar Allan Poe , " The Literary Life of Thingum Bob , Esq . " <p> T IS MORNING , AFTER I READ the morning paper and opened and read my mail , a terrible , cold sadness came over me , and I began to think seriously of life and death in a way that I had never done before . I live alone and am somewhat deaf , and nothing in my silent home or even beyond my curtained windows intruded on my thoughts . I have decided to write down some of those thoughts and the conclusions to which they led , perhaps only to confirm or deny them in my own mind , but perhaps also , should they still seem valid , to share them with a heedless world in a vain attempt to rectify a dreadful injustice that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most . <p> I am a poet . I have given my life to poetry , or at least I have subordinated everything else in my life to poetry . Perhaps that is what drew my eye to the familiar face of Edgar Allan Poe on the front page of the morning news . It was a copy of the spurious Matthew Brady daguerreotype , a reversed image at two removes from the " Ultima Thule " daguerreotype of 1848 , that truest photographic image of Poe , in which love and death mingle desperately upon his awful , uneven face . The article concerned a new attempt to solve the mystery of his death in Baltimore , but what caught my attention was not so much the ingenious solution as the efforts by the journalist to belie once again the fallacious stories about Poe 's drinking and his death , a myth set in motion nearly a century and a half ago in a slanderous obituary notice written by his literary executor and first biographer Rufus Wilmot Griswold , the Harold Bloom or Livingston Angel of his day . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : how he chose Griswold , perhaps the most respected American literary scholar of the time , as his executor without realizing that Griswold still harbored resentment over Poe 's somewhat critical 1842 review of his The Poets and Poetry of America ; how Griswold created the myth of a profligate , alcoholic Poe , even to the point of altering passages in Poe 's letters to support his lies ; but also how Griswold 's edition of Poe 's writings was impeccably produced , possibly the best and most accurate nineteenthcentury edition we have of any American writer . It is a story filled with ironies and mysteries , all of which circle around the central question : why would Rufus Griswold have attempted to destroy Poe 's reputation on the one hand and nevertheless to preserve his work so carefully on the other ? <p> It was not about that puzzling question that I first began to think , however , but rather about the ironic results of both of Griswold 's efforts . Edgar Allan Poe is one of the most widely read and known writers in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and yet the vast majority of readers know only a simulacrum , a grotesque created by Griswold as completely and thoroughly as Roderick Usher was created by Poe . Then , after I had opened and dealt with my mail , I found myself extending my thoughts to the ultimate fragility of all human experience , to the icy privacy and evanescence of every individual identity . <p> What do I , for all my strivings to purge Griswold 's Poe from my mind , to research and discover his true life and self , really know of Edgar Poe ? I have read the fat biographies one by one , only to find a multiplicity of Poes , vaguely similar but unsettlingly different . I have read and reread Poe 's work and found there a better and more substantial image of the man , but it too shimmers and transforms as I make new discoveries or lose faith in those I had earlier made . What do I know of Poe 's mind as he sat for Edwin Manchester 's daguerreotype in Providence in 1848 , only four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do I know of his feelings as he lingered more than once in the parlor with his mother-in-law , listening to his young wife Virginia 's sweet voice as she sang ? Or of what charitable thoughts moved him to stroke the wet , black , bedraggled fur of a staggering , worn , and weary cat in an alley in Richmond days or weeks or even months before he died ? All those years of thoughts and feelings , of dreams and prayers , dissolved and lost as though they had never been ? No wonder that he cried out in a poem , " And all I lov 'd  --  I lov 'd alone . " <p> And I thought with sudden insight of myself , then , sitting alone in an empty house , holding in my possession a unique life that no one else would ever know : the hours I spent as a child keeping elaborate scores and records for games of my own invention-some with a tennis ball and racquet , targeting the rectangular openings in the green glider on the front porch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball , a football , a golf club , a set of dog-eared " Famous Authors " cards ; the thrill I felt the first time I heard a poem written for grownups and understood the power of words , that words could do things to me and for me that I had never dreamt ( the poem was , of course , by Poe , " The Bells , " my heart suddenly keeping time , time in a sort of Runic rhyme ) ; the image of nine-year-old Anna moving across her yard toward the chair in which I , eleven years old , sat reading , she wearing an almost diaphanous white nightgown that licked around her knobby knees and sighed across her thin little body , coming to sit in my lap and whisper a girl 's secrets to me , secrets no boy should ever know ; of Sandy and Eleanor holding me down in that same yard , Sandy sitting on my stomach as they took turns kissing me with cool , wet lips over and over as I squirmed and struggled to escape ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray metal desk with my new Christmas fountain pen and a stack of lined notebook paper and wrote poem after poem after poem , the first poems of my life , ten of them , twelve , a score , my skin hot to my own touch , the fever called living in my heart and eye ; of Melissa 's face , flushed and red , streaked with white tear tracks , as I tried to explain why we could no longer be engaged , why I knew as deeply as I knew anything that my poetry came first , would always come first , and would allow no rivals , not even her , whom I loved more than I had ever loved anyone on this sublunary planet , or ever would ; of the three days I carried my first book of poems always with me , crushing its slim volume to my chest-walking with it , eating with it , sleeping with it , leaving it out of my sight only when I showered and toweled myself dry ; how startled and puzzled I was when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a female red-bellied woodpecker working her slow , careful , bright way up a stone wall , plucking small surprises from its chinks and crannies , heedless of the minatory cries of hovering crows ; how I felt when I opened the brand new copy of Angel 's conclusive and canonical Twentieth-Century Poets and Poetry of America , which I had just hacked and pried loose from its heavy cardboard mailing box , and ran my eager finger down the long rows of familiar names in its table of contents ; all those memories that come unbidden , day by day , of my parents and their parents , of cars and streetcars , of privately meaningful songs and meaningless advertising jingles ; of the movement of weather , the procession of dreams and daydreams , and the crashing of my wounded , lonely , passionate , pulsing , yearning , volcanic heart . <p> I resisted the urge to dig into my storage closet to find the worn albums in which my parents had chronicled their lives and mine , to leaf through those black , stiff pages with immemorially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their legends precisely inscribed in careful white ink . I resisted , in other words , the urge to maudlin self-pity and pointless angst . I busied myself with household chores and overwhelmed my sorrow and fear with the vacuum 's whir and the dryer 's thumping rumble . But at lunchtime , when , still feeling cold despite my exertions , I settled at my dinette table to a bowl of hot soup , I found myself returning to the enigma of Rufus Griswold and the question of why he had behaved as he had . <p> Among the more plausible explanations for the scurrilous inaccuracy of the biography and the scrupulous accuracy of his edition of Poe 's works are : 1 ) that Griswold 's desire for revenge led him to distort the facts of Poe 's life in order to ruin his reputation ( and thereby to render Poe 's negative remarks about Griswold 's earlier book null and void ) , but that his scholarly integrity would not allow him to do a less than perfect job on the editing ; or 2 ) that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit of spreading contradictory information about himself , but the texts were available to any scholar with access to an adequate library , so distortions in them would have been immediately exposed ; or 3 ) that he either felt an obligation to fulfill the terms of the will or saw the chance to enhance his reputation by editing Poe 's works , but that he genuinely thought the poems and stories were aesthetically defective and , /or morally deficient , so much so that he created a flawed and immoral life for Poe to make the discovery of those defects inevitable without having to point them out himself ( thereby making people question why he had chosen to edit works he considered unworthy ) . <p> The first two explanations depend on Griswold 's being sufficiently wounded by Poe 's 1842 review to seek revenge over a decade later . Heaven knows that bad reviews do wound an author cruelly , and such a blow might well drive one to desperate and irrational acts of revenge . Poe 's review of Griswold did contain some disagreements with his choice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it concluded with words of high , strong praise . The book should be regarded , Poe said , even using italics , as " the most important addition which our literature has for many years received , " and he went on to say that Griswold " has entitled himself to the thanks of his countrymen , while showing himself a man of taste , talent , and tact . " What more could Rufus Griswold have wanted ? Was he as obsessive and mad as one of Poe 's own characters ? If so , what would he have done if Poe 's review had been as personally vindictive and viciously unfair as the one by Livingston Angel that greeted my first collection in the pages of the New York Times Book Review thirty years ago ? He would have walled up Edgar Allan Poe , still alive , in his cellar , I assure you . <p> Other than this one incident , however , there is no evidence that Rufus Griswold was meanspirited or vengeful . He was a respected literary figure of his day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Untermeyer or Williams , Poulin or Angel ; he was obviously respected and trusted by Poe , who was very sensitive to suspicious behavior among the literati . I found myself unable to accept revenge as the motive for Griswold 's curious behavior ; nor could I believe that he had aesthetic or moral reasons for hating Poe 's work . How could he have spent seven years collecting and editing that work so diligently if he despised it ? That would have required that he be quite as mad as the narrator of " The Tell-Tale Heart , " willing to spend an entire hour slowly placing his head within the opening of a harmless old man 's door or seven years editing work that would have cut to the very heart of his self-esteem . A man so mad as that would surely over those seven years and the rest of his life have revealed his madness in other ways . Like the narrator of " The Imp of the Perverse , " he would have had no choice but to confess his crime by word or deed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cask of Amontillado , " safe for half a century , finally had to tell the tale . <p> No , I thought , the puzzle remains unanswered . <p> I carried the Angel anthology to my favorite chair , my greatgrandfather 's leather rocker , planning to examine it more closely than I had after receiving it in the morning 's mail ; but before I had done more than riffle its pages idly back and forth , I felt myself falling slowly but surely asleep , as irresistibly as though my luncheon cup had been drugged . <p> I slept for only half an hour , slumped awkwardly against one leather wing of the old , sturdy chair , which moved ever so slightly on its rockers with my every breath . When I reluctantly awoke , I could not at first place myself in time , but then the afternoon light sifting through the blinds led me to remember who and where I was and to speak aloud the day 's name , the month 's , the year 's . The book lay open in my lap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been reading it in my dreams , dreams filled with motion and forgotten lore , echoing dimly and then fading almost away . It was just then , at that moment , somewhere between sleep and waking , in that ratiocinative realm between reason and imagination , that I found the answers to the questions I had been pondering in all their awesome and awful simplicity . Rufus Griswold was not a villain but a saint ! <p> The answer had been there all along : in the predominant idea of motion that haunts the restless pages of Poe 's poems and stories ; in the idea of repose in " The Philosophy of Furniture , " of placid suspension in " Landor 's Cottage , " of the silent vision of paradisal Arnheim ; of the greater vision of the loss of individual identity in Eureka , in which all motion is finally revealed to be the throbbing of the Heart Divine . We simply had failed to understand the message of his works : why in " Ulalume " the speaker 's heart grows " ashen and sober @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her tomb , why volumes of " forgotten lore " call up the painful specter of the raven , why the narrator of " Lenore " wants no memorial bell to mar her soul 's flight from " the damn6d Earth , " why each visitor stirs the valley of unrest into motion , why only when the dead who lie in the vast necropolis by the sea are completely forgotten shall that city sink " amid no earthly moans " into the welcoming waves where " Hell , rising from a thousand thrones , / Shall do it reverence . " We had not understood , but Rufus Griswold did and , understanding , chose to martyr himself to earn for Edgar Poe the eternal repose of Paradise . <p> The message , or so it seemed to me , quite simply was this : every burial is premature , but as long as the dead are remembered they must remain , restless and unfulfilled , on this planet , unable to fly like Lenore " unto a high estate within the utmost Heaven . " Only when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't Jesus himself say " let the dead bury their dead " ? No wonder the " Sheeted Memories of the Past . . . start and sigh " when they meet , in " Dream-Land , " an earthly traveler , someone who may recognize them , may remember them , may draw them however briefly back into this life . <p> I 'll admit that I still do n't understand all the implications of this insight , but I am sure that it is true . It explains why the gentle Tasaday of Mindanao were so eager to look at photographs of themselves taken by their modern " discoverers , " but would close their eyes when shown one of a tribe member who had recently died . It explains why Hamlet cries out so bitterly to Ophelia about his father , " O heavens ! die two months ago , and not forgotten yet ? " All our readings of literature must be reconsidered . Think of the agony of Ozymandias in Paradise when the traveler comes upon his shattered visage amid the lone and level sands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten , but that he has been remembered . And think of the agony it must be for a writer whose name has been safely forgotten when some eager graduate student " rediscovers " his or her work in order to make an academic reputation . Perhaps even a passing mention of Vina Delmar or Fannie Hurst , Fitz-Greene Halleck or Richard Henry Wilde , may be enough to cause a pang of sorrow and suffering in Paradise . <p> And I went on to think of our lives , of our feverish lives . Just as Poe must have inadvertently caused Virginia to suffer by remembering her so intensely , have we not been punishing those we love most by indulging in mournful and never-ending remembrance ? And are we not , like the man in " The Raven " whose soul " Shall be lifted-nevermore , " punishing ourselves as well ? It came to me that it is not a curse but a blessing that the nexus of experience we call the self will always be erased , first by failing memory and then by death . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I treasure so much and have been making into poems for so many years should and must be forgotten . That realization began to soothe my worry and ease my fear , the burden of remembering finally eased : those long and lonely walks I used to take through the long-forgotten bowers of sculptured ivy and stone flowers of the cemetery where all of my family lie in such carefully tended order , and my futile efforts to call them to mind , to feel their living presence in that crowded emptiness ; the time I bumped into Melissa in the confusion of the Atlanta airport , she more beautiful than I remembered , congratulating me on my successes , pressing her fat wallet into my hand so I could see the photos of her children , three smiling girls , caught for only a second in the forward motion of their happy lives ; the frustrated hours I spent seeking the perfect rhyme for orange or silver , or counting tired iambs on my fingers late into the night ; Anna , who died so young ; the loneliness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like ice fields around the small islet of faint heat my body could produce , my heart barely beating ; the bitterness I 've felt when the annual prizes were announced , the Pulitzer , the National Book Award , the Hardison , the Lilly , cursing the names of men and women whose poems I had formerly read with delight ; the anger I have felt when someone I knew interrupted me while at work on a particularly difficult line with a phone call asking for help , which I always denied them ; all those dreams in which I am troubled by the dark cries of black birds , the stirring of wind in the leaves , a sudden chill in the air , even as I am surrounded happily , touching and being touched , by all my loved ones , all those friends and family whom I have lost forever . <p> I saw all this suddenly and completely , and I understood at that moment why Rufus Griswold had acted as he did . He had risked his own head in a bet with the devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he had lost the bet . <p> What better way to allow Poe to escape the valley of unrest , to find his way to Paradise , than to assure that he would be forgotten ? How Griswold must have struggled with his problem . If he did not edit Poe 's works , someone who did not understand would do the job . He could not damage the stories and poems by emendation because they were too widely read . What could he do ? The answer must have come quickly , for he began immediately to act upon his plan in the obituary he published in the New York Daily Tribune only two days after Poe 's death . Perhaps it , too , came to him unbidden in an afternoon dream ; perhaps the restless dead contact us in our dreams , hoping vainly that we can help them in their struggle to escape , to be forgotten . In any case , I can imagine the relief he felt when he arrived at his elegant solution : to slander Poe so thoroughly and so well that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readership would cancel him from the canon of respected literature , would relegate him to a footnote in works that would soon be canceled themselves by changing critical fashions . How was he , sheltered as he was by scholarly life , to fathom the perversity of a reading public that reveled then , as now , in scandal , and that demanded then , as now , that its artists be profligate and self-destructive ? The poet who gives his life to poetry is still ignored , while the drunkard who staggers to an early grave is revered . If only Griswold had known that a thoroughly bland and mundane life story would have guaranteed Poe 's relegation to the blissful ranks of the forgotten . <p> For those with eyes to see , Griswold placed a clue to what he was up to right in that slanderous obituary , which concludes with the line , " After life 's fitful fever he sleeps well . " Could there be a clearer sign ? He put another in the title he chose for his edition : The Works of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparatively recently ( as the dictionary defines late ) and was therefore assuredly dead , but , alas for poor Poe and alas for poor Griswold , Edgar Allan Poe continued and continues to live . Every time anyone reads a word he wrote , writes a paper or attends a conference , receives an award from the Mystery Writers of America , even goes to a professional football game in Baltimore , he must groan in anguish . And with him , compounding the error of Griswold 's wager , live and suffer his dear Virginia and her mother ; Poe 's own lost parents ; the women to whom he turned in his desperate efforts to forget and free Virginia ; even Dr. Carter of Richmond , who loaned him his cane for that last , fatal trip  --  all of them denied in varying degree the solace of paradisal repose . The bitterest irony for Rufus Griswold , the bet he lost along with Poe , is that he , too , is remembered , a man who , like all literary critics , surely would have quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the small , dry print of a bibliography . His martyrdom complete , he lingers on , his life and his saintly deed as completely misunderstood and vilified as the life of Edgar Poe . <p> I began to search for the newspaper with the article about Poe 's death , thinking as I looked that the picture they should have used was the so-called Thompson daguerreotype , an image of gentle happiness , reflecting the security Poe felt in Richmond , safe among friends and admirers , where he had been living soberly and had become engaged to his boyhood sweetheart , Elmira Royster Shelton . " I never was received with such warmth , " he wrote Maria Clemm , and his face reflects that warmth , Virginia fading in his memory to her eternal bliss . And yet , there in his buttonhole is a sprig of holly , the traditional symbol of the crown of thorns pressed down on Jesus ' brow , as if the terrible results of Griswold 's kindly efforts were prefigured , as if somehow the pattern were already set and Poe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newspaper tossed down beside my great-grandfather 's chair , lying under Angel 's anthology , which I had let slip from my lap after my dream revelation . I picked up the book and the paper and placed them side by side upon my writing desk . I was drawn to lift the book yet again and , feeling another intense chill as of the grave , for the fifth or sixth time that day looked at the table of contents where my name did not appear . <p> I understood then the true meaning of the refrain of Poe 's most famous poem . I realized that , despite my absence from that list of canonized names , I had done myself a favor , perhaps the greatest favor of all , by giving my life to poetry , by renouncing the warmth a family might have afforded , by cutting myself off even from friends in the solitude I found behind my chamber door . I understood that after life 's fitful fever is past , when my poems are forgotten , as they surely will be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I will receive a blessing my more honored rivals , like Poe and Griswold , will forevermore be denied : the blessing of Paradise ; a repose which seems the phantom handiwork , conjointly , of the Sylphs , of the Fairies , of the Gen , and of the Gnomes ; the raven 's blessing , " Nevermore .
