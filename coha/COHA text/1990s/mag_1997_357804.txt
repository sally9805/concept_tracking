One year into Bill Clinton 's second term , and one week after he lost the fight over fast track , it is finally possible to answer a question that has dogged his presidency : Has Clinton created a new centrism within the Democratic Party , or has he killed off the last vestiges of the old centrism he inherited ? The answer is yes to both questions . <P> When Clinton took office , the Democratic Party already had a centrist wing , and it looked like Martin Lancaster , Congressman from the Outer Banks of North Carolina . Lancaster spent his childhood on a tobacco farm and his adulthood in the naval reserves . In so doing , he embodied the two economic pillars of many rural districts throughout the South : agriculture and the military . In Congress he lovingly cared for eastern Carolina 's Fort Bragg and Camp Lejeune . And he defended subsidies for tobacco , peanuts and hogs ( one of the district 's biggest exporters was called Carolina Oink Express ) . <P> Eastern Carolina had one more export : conservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Blue defeated the Gray , and Lancaster was no different . He backed the death penalty ; he supported Star Wars ; he voted to ban federal money for obscene art . But Lancaster also supported Clinton 's tax increase in 1993 and his crime bill the year after , and in 1994 an upstart Republican bombarded the Carolina coast with pictures of Lancaster jogging with a President everyone despised . Lancaster and dozens of moderate Democrats like him went down to defeat . It was death by Clinton . <P> But if Clinton had not become President , Ellen Tauscher 's political career could never have been born . California Congresswoman Tauscher represents a district that until 1992 did not exist , a swath of Bay Area suburbia that only decades ago was empty grassland . Not long ago , upscale , sun-drenched suburbs like hers were solid Republican territory . But that was before the religious right colonized the G.O.P. So the well-educated secularites of the suburban Bay began in the ' 80s to lean Democratic and were ripe for the wonkish Clinton . He was fiscally disciplined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which their prosperity was built . Tauscher followed in his wake . A millionaire former stockbroker and businesswoman , she looked , at first glance , like a Rockefeller Republican . Her husband actually was a Republican . In 1996 Tauscher took on an incumbent Republican , attacked him for opposing abortion and gun control , and won a seat in Congress . <P> The evolution of the Democratic center from Lancasterism to Tauscherism has not been adequately appreciated . Most of the ink evaluating moderate Democrats in Congress has been spilled on the Blue Dogs , an alliance of mostly Southern , mostly rural , mostly socially conservative House Democrats founded in early 1995 . But the Blue Dogs are  --  pardon the expression  --  a dying breed . They gained six new members in 1997 but lost nine to retirement , defeat and party switching . Their membership totals 24.
