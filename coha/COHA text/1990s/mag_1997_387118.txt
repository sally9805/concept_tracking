What 's ahead for the stock market , the economy , and the future of investing : Market guru Abby Cohen of Goldman Sachs , perennial bear Jim Grant , and mutual fund dean Shelby Davis square off . BY LAWRENCE A. ARMOUR // Poor Abby . As Wall Street 's reigning guru , Abby Joseph Cohen of Goldman Sachs has nothing but bad times ahead . How 's that , when she 's constantly quoted by the media and courted by a growing swell of clients , when her word alone can calm a troubled market ( as it did late last year ) ? Because when the market finally turns-which someday it will-she will either be dethroned as all-knowing seer because she missed it or be blamed for making it happen because she called it . In other words , she 's been set up to fail . Until that day , though , Cohen 's remains the voice all Wall Street wants to hear , which is why we were intrigued by the prospect of listening in when she debated two other market experts recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of those experts has been as bearish in recent years as Abby Cohen has been bullish : Jim Grant , editor of the biweekly Grant 's Interest Rate Observer . But even though Grant has been wrong , he retains an enormous following among investors in all camps because of his insight and willingness to challenge Wall Street convention . Photograph The three amigos ( left to right ) : Shelby Davis , Jim Grant , and Abby Cohen // The other voice belongs to fund manager Shelby Davis-not a market commentator from on high , but rather an investor in the trenches , actually pulling the trigger on stock buys and sells , with a history of impressive success . His oldest fund , Davis New York Venture , has outperformed the S &P; 500 in 17 of the past 20 years . We invited this trio to bounce their latest ideas off each other in a FORTUNE conference room while we sat quietly by . As it turned out , we heard things we had n't expected . Both Cohen and Grant , for instance , actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promising . All three clashed about the Fed-Davis saying that in raising rates Alan Greenspan " is out to dampen financial speculation " rather than inflation , Cohen countering that Greenspan " has said it 's not the Fed 's job to regulate P/E ratios , " and Grant providing the exclamation point , calling the Fed " the Interstate Commerce Commission of money , the Wizard of Oz . " Grant 's take : " To believe that the Fed 's wise management of one rate will affect inflation and the economy is one of the biggest unexamined articles of faith on Wall Street . " Their discussion went on for more than two hours , which we 've condensed into five sections . It was n't easy . THE BIG PICTURE Abby Cohen told Grant and Davis that this year she expected low double-digit gains in stock prices , matching corporate earnings growth . Stocks are n't undervalued , she argued , but they 're not overvalued either . Grant , predictably , disagreed , troubled by everything from " the bull market in wages " to the minimal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the least overpriced things available to the investor , " he said . With this divergence of opinion , what should the average investor do ? It 's a question Cohen would n't even address at first " There is no average investor " - but Davis made a strong case for equities as a longterm investment . That 's when Grant jumped in and turned up the heat . Grant : It strikes me that the idea of investing for the long pull is a cyclical phenomenon . It is no accident that long-term investing is the mantra of the individual investor now that the Dow is at 7000 , just as it was no accident that the same approach was heresy in the Seventies . These ideas ebb and flow with the collective psychology of the market . This is a millennial time , literally and figuratively , and an age of wonders , but think of the paradoxes that have been created . I have n't done the math , but I 'd bet the market cap of Intel and the market cap of all India are approximately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in May of last year when Iomega and Presstek blew up . We 've had a succession of speculative crackups since then that have left fewer and fewer stocks participating on the upside . It 's possible we 'll look back one day and say the whole thing topped out last spring . Davis : Anything 's possible , but a lot of stocks have been acting very well , and the huge speculation in Internet and biotech stocks has corrected . You could take this as being healthy-that these speculative events were cut off before they became a cancer that infected the whole market . It 's been a vote of confidence that we 've been able to rotate out of one sector and into others without the averages plummeting . Cohen : There 's a connection between the way the markets have behaved and the way the economy has behaved . Not only is inflation down , inflation expectations are down , and that will have an impact ultimately on the pace of economic growth . We 've also had a reinvigoration of corporate sector profit margins , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not saying either one is going to stick around forever . But it 's clear that the performance of the economy has truly improved . One area where individual investors have an advantage over us professionals is that we drive ourselves crazy trying to figure out what the latest 8:30 A.M. report means . We analyze it and overanalyze it , while in reality we 've got an economy that moves like a supertanker . It took many years to turn it around and get it going in the right direction . It will take just as much to change the momentum . At some point it 's going to veer off course , but we 're not there yet . Davis : But individual investors have to recognize that they 've got to lower their expectations . We 've moved from 1000 on the Dow to 7000 very quickly . If we reach 10,000 by the year 2000 , that will be a lot less percentagewise than what we 're used to . I suspect we 'll see 1,000-point corrections along the way , which will be scary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sectors that have n't been leading the way will have their day as we rotate our way upward . Grant : I can think of several things , macro things , that are now or may soon be leaning against the favorable trend in earnings , which has been driving the market . One is the exchange rate . The second is the bull market in wages . The third is energy prices . Crude oil has dropped from $27 a barrel to around $20 . If prices were to move up again , it would be a force against improving profits . Cohen : I think you 're overstating the case . All commodity prices combined represent 6% to 7% of total U.S. business costs . It would be a problem for some industries if energy prices were to rise , but it would not be an economywide problem . As for currency , it 's been the dog that has n't barked . We have seen very dramatic increases in the dollar relative to the yen and the mark over the past several quarters , but we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just not as currency-sensitive as it used to be . If you produce something that 's a commoditywhether it 's a chemical or a DRAM-you can get hurt on a competitive basis . But so many of our industries produce value-added stuff - either goods or services - that small changes in currency really have n't had much of an impact on the economy . BANKING STOCKS // Davis ' picks // The discussion of economic growth led our trio to a discussion of banking , where capacity has been growing . Cohen and Grant disagreed about what that ultimately indicates . The flashpoint : Citicorp . Grant : Capital in banking has compounded in the past five years at a faster rate than during any half-decade since the turn of the century . Despite mergers and amalgamations , we 're seeing the consequences of that excess capital in the pricing of credit and the compression of spreads in all areas of the credit markets . How can this be bullish for banks ? Citicorp is now going into the credit card business in India . Great . Is this the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it might be worse , but it 's certainly different . I do n't think the opening of capitalism to three billion people is all unmitigatedly and unreservedly terrific . Cohen : My first job was as a junior economist at the Fed . There was something on the order of 16,600 banks in the U.S. at the time , and six in Canada . Today there are about 10,000 here and still six in Canada . This tells you that we do n't necessarily need all the banks we have . Are we bullish on banking ? Yes , but we 're not suggesting an overweighted position in the industry . What we are saying is that there are a handful of extremely well-managed U.S. banks that will benefit from the consolidation trends here and from the reduction in trade barriers overseas . One of them happens to be Citicorp . I do n't know anything about the Indian credit card business , but Citicorp has become the multinational corporation 's banker of choice . Grant : Citicorp is going down-market in India , Mexico , and Hungary because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in multinational lending . Davis : Risk in banking comes from concentration in geography or customer category , so to some degree you broaden your market when you go down-market . Rather than making all your loans to , say , a Mexican government that could default , you have tens of thousands of loans to Mexican citizens via credit cards , auto loans , or whatever , and maybe they all do n't default at once . The Canadian banks survived the energy collapse a few years back , but none of the Texas banks did . Why ? The Canadian banks are spread across seven provinces , whereas the Texas banks were all sitting in Houston and Dallas . I agree with Abby that you have to pick and choose among banks . It 's become a commodity business , and you either have to have a niche or , in Citicorp 's case , a global operation where you can build businesses because you 've got a brand name . Citicorp is one of our major holdings . We also like Wells Fargo , which has a cost-cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BancOne Corp. , a consumer franchise bank that 's skilled at acquisitions and has the scope to develop a brand name in financial services . The stock sells at about ten times our estimates of 1998 earnings , which means it 's behind the market . TECH STOCKS // Cohen 's picks // Technology stocks have been a huge driver of the market , both up and down . Grant , naturally , was most concerned with the downside , but even Davis took a moment to ponder the wisdom of paying 50 times earnings for a stock-just about where Microsoft is now sitting . Davis : A portfolio manager has to always ask himself two questions : How much can I make , and how much can I lose ? Usually the higher the PIE , the higher the expectations for growth . But if the growth does n't come , you 've got a double whammy because you layer shrinking earnings estimates onto a compression in the P/E ratio . We 're into moderate-growth companies where the earnings are sustainable and the multiples reasonable . And we look hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing just single-digit revenue growth these days . It 's not a good sign . That 's why I like Hewlett-Packard , which has compounded its sales growth at something like 19% a year since the midFifties . It has gone through innumerable product cycles and reinvented itself dozens of times . It 's a global company that 's selling at 1.5 to 2 times sales and maybe 13 times 1998 earnings estimates . That 's a lot more reasonable than a P/E of 50 . Grant : For the flip side of the tech game , look at Micron Technology , which I see as a wonderful example of speculation and Wall Street self-delusion . Micron is a commodity producer of semiconductor chips . Its stock fell from $90 a share to $20 or so , then bounced back to $45 even as DRAM capacity was expanding and prices were collapsing . It was a story sponsored by brokerage firms that were angling for Micron 's investment banking business . It became like the 31st Dow stock . People believed it was invincible . Cohen : As a percentage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tech companies have outperformed the market because they 've outperformed the economy . Growth rates have slowed somewhat , and competition is becoming more intense , including from Europe and Japan . But many U.S. companies really do have a proprietary edge , and if you focus on the higher-quality names , you should do quite well . Microsoft and Intel are sensible things to own . Same goes for Dell and Compaq . Penetration has increased in the personal computer business , but there seems to be substantial demand both for new purchases and for replacement . Grant : I get a little concerned when I see technology companies paying their officers with options . To the extent that they treat this as a balance-sheet rather than an income-statement item , they are overstating earnings . If and when these stocks come down and these companies have to pay cash compensation , it will instantly show up in the income statement . Cohen : We have just done an exhaustive study that concludes that the quality of earnings is actually superb . There are three basic reasons . First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of the earnings gains companies were reporting related to the fact that they were jacking up the prices of whatever it was they were selling . Today there 's no inflation padding . Second , accounting standards are tougher . The FASB has annoyed corporations for years and has forced them to adopt more conservative accounting . Third , corporate write-offs , which averaged 30% to 35% of S &P; reported earnings in the early Nineties , were like 6% to 7% in 1996 . Does this mean there 's no flexibility for companies to do things to their reported earnings ? No , but on average the quality of what 's being reported is better now than it has been anytime in my professional lifetime . Grant : Bull markets have many great uses , but they do n't produce much in the way of vigilance and skepticism . I do n't think the Street is doing as good a job as it might in analyzing companies . A preoccupation with the investment banking business is one of the cyclically recurring scandals on Wall Street , and we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in how people forgot to look under the hood is Centennial Technologies , which had a $1 billion market cap and was the New York Stock Exchange 's top-performing stock in 1996 . The former CEO is now in jail , and the Feds are trying to figure out if any of the sales the company reported were real . This kind of thing happens because , in a rising tide of prosperity , skepticism does n't pay . That being the case , I think you have to expect that many companies are guilty of shading and trimming earnings these days . SMALL CAPS // Grant 's picks // Shelby Davis brought up the idea that the large-cap index stocks have been leading the field of late . That prompted the conversation to turn to underappreciated smaller companies . Cohen : Small caps have performed poorly relative to the overall market , but not because of fundamentals . By and large , these companies have done extremely well as businesses . This creates a valuation opportunity . Davis : The long economic cycle has benefited the big-cap companies because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 've benefited from restructurings because they had more work to do . The opening up of the world has created opportunities for big companies with global operations . And then there 's supply and demand . The big companies have tended to be big buyers of their own stock , whereas the smaller companies have tended to be issuers . Cohen : That 's an important distinction . Six years into an economic expansion , you normally would be seeing a significant number of secondary offerings from large companies . That 's not the case because the cash and earnings generation at these companies is so outstanding they do n't need to come to market . Here 's another thought : In the Fifties individuals owned 90% of US. stocks directly . They now own only about 50% . Instead , more and more people participate in the market through corporate pension funds and , increasingly , 401(k) programs , many of which are index-oriented and do n't even look at small-cap offerings . So it could be that there 's not much demand for small-cap stocks because individuals who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of big household names to invest in . Davis : But there are so many small companies out there you 'd better be sure you have the right small caps and not the promotions or the ones that got underwritten at a time when they should have still been in the venture capital stage . We like junior oil companies like Noble Affiliates and Devon Energy . Nobody 's sure where oil and gas prices are going , but at five or six times cash flow , these stocks are pretty reasonable . We like Martin Marietta Materials , which is one of the largest sand and gravel companies in the country . It benefits from infrastructure spending and the resurgence of construction , whether it 's highways , hospitals , schools , or prisons . And we like AirTouch Communications , which has a strong operating team that 's positioned AirTouch as a global wireless services company . It 's a business that should grow for years to come , driven by technology improvements in phones and reception , and by lower prices that will stimulate usage . Cohen : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks reasonable to me . In technology , pick among the ruins and you find Stratus Computer , which makes network servers , where the fundamental business remains intact . Carmike Cinema , a movie theater operator , is a small consumer services company with good earnings growth . Dole Food , a mid-cap stock that sells $2.5 billion of fresh fruits and veggies every year , is another consumer-products company that trades at a market multiple or less despite the fact that it has a sound franchise and consistent earnings growth . Davis : Bottom line , making money in stocks has less to do with the size of the company than with something Ben Graham once said and Warren Buffett frequently repeats : In the short term , the stock market is a voting machine ; in the long term , it 's a weighing machine . In other words , if you can find companies where earnings are going to pile up so that they weigh more five or ten years down the road , then you 'll make money . GIVING A BEAR HIS DUE Sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even Gucci Group , which he calls " fashion outfitter to the bull market . " But there are other areas he actually likes on the long side . Grant : I may be bearish on the U.S. stock market , but I 'm bullish on humanity . In a world that is supposedly being restored , renewed , and reinvigorated by the decline of communism and the opening up of global markets , investors ought not be fixated on the U.S. We put out an Asian publication that every two weeks reports on a new bear market somewhere . Bear markets are as opportunity-laden as bull markets can be treacherous , and there are some very good companies in Thailand , South Korea , and the Philippines right now whose stocks are down 50% or more . They are benefiting no less than U.S. companies from the new world that 's unfolding . If that world turns out to be a mirage , we 'll all be the poorer . If not , these stocks are cheap . In commodities , I 'm bullish on wheat because of the persistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three meals a day , more and more people are availing themselves of the opportunity . Wheat inventories are perhaps the lowest in 30 years relative to consumption . I 'm also bullish on Indian equities . India is deregulating some of its interest rates and effecting other pro-market reforms , which should be good for stocks . My vehicle of choice here would be the Morgan Stanley India Investment Fund . Lastly-and this will probably shock you-I 'm bullish on biotech . I do n't pretend to be a research scientist , but I ca n't help but notice that companies like Genelabs Technologies-which is working on a drug for lupus-and Bio-Rad Laboratories-which is a leader in life science research products-have been cast into the outer darkness by a market that is prepared to seize on almost any bullish story about personal computers . I suspect the cycle will one day turn . <p>
