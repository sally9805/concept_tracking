Section : School Wars American Education Under Siege <p> ' WHEN I first heard about outcome-based education through my son 's high school , I was excited , ' says Alan Klaus of North Kansas City . Finally they were talking about setting some standards . But the more I learned about it , the more concerned I became . . . . OBE is just not what it seems to be . ' Appointed by the Missouri Board of Education to a citizens ' oversight committee , Mr. Klaus eventually co-wrote a report blasting the reforms he had initially welcomed . <p> Mr. Klaus 's experience is not unique . More than thirty states have dabbled with some form of outcome-based education , and parents around the country have discovered that , despite its name , OBE has little to do with raising academic standards . Instead , it replaces existing standards with vague , often psychotherapeutic goals . These new goals become the criteria for assessing students , teachers , and schools . <p> OBE can be seen as an attempt to divert the movement for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ronald Reagan 's Department of Education , particularly under William Bennett , operated on the assumption that American education had become unresponsive to the market it served . Reaganites therefore proposed initiatives to increase the influence of parents and taxpayers on the schools : a nationwide information network to publicize the track records of schools ; national standards to raise the achievement of American students ; and school vouchers to let parents ' preferences reshape education . These reforms were opposed every step of the way by what Bennett calls the blob ' ' : the educational establishment , consisting of teachers ' unions and state bureaucracies . <p> Outcome-based education is the blob 's counter-attack against these Reaganite initiatives . OBE prevents parents and taxpayers from assessing the academic progress of their local schools ; de-emphasizes achievement in traditional subject areas ; and allocates more money to each of public education 's constituencies . With the exception of vouchers , which OBE advocates reject unconditionally , the method of this counter-attack is to detach the mechanisms of the reform movement from its goals . <p> Opposition has grown as parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debated in states as different as Pennsylvania , Minnesota , Kentucky , and Colorado . Criticism has forced officials in many states to revise their OBE plans or even to drop them altogether , as Virginia Governor Douglas Wilder did last year . Opponents of OBE are so passionate that they sometimes ignore important differences between OBE plans , portraying them all as part of a nationwide conspiracy . But the truth is that OBE means different things in different places . In some states and districts , OBE involves a radical transformation of state assessment systems , curricula , even grading options ; in others , OBE amounts to little more than the announcement of platitudinous goals . <p> If OBE takes its rhetoric from the 1980s standards movement , its ideology derives from an eclectic rehash of learning theories from the Sixties and Seventies . OBE descends in particular from a variant of applied behaviorism called mastery learning . ' Under mastery learning , students were to be tested and retested on a unit of instruction until everyone could pass ; only then could the class advance to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scores on a test : mastery ' and not yet . ' ( Phyllis Schlafly , whose Eagle Forum has been in the forefront of opposition to OBE , quips , Perhaps this is what they mean by ' lifelong learning . ' ' ' ) Quick learners were to do peer tutoring ' to help the slower ones . <p> Like other egalitarian projects , mastery learning had perverse results . High achievers grew bored and frustrated ; tests were dumbed down to speed up the slowest kids ; and average students began to realize that they no longer had to study , since they could always repeat a test . Incomplete ' replaced C ' as the badge of mediocrity . When Chicago 's elementary schools adopted mastery learning in the Seventies , the results drove parents to sue the school system for educational malpractice . <p> OBE and mastery learning share both a common philosophy and many of the same popularizers . Bill Spady , head of the pro-OBE High Success Network , admitted as much in a 1992 interview with Educational Leadership magazine : In January of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Network for Outcome-Based Schools . Most of the people who were there . . . had a strong background in mastery learning , since it was what OBE was called at the time . But I pleaded with the group not to use the name ' mastery learning ' in the network 's new name because the word ' mastery ' had already been destroyed through poor implementation . ' <p> Like mastery learning , OBE eschews the classification of students by ability or achievement . The National Center for Outcome-Based Education declares that failure should be removed from our vocabulary and thoughts ' and that children should never have to compete for learning or for grades . For the most part , we believe competition in the classroom is destructive . ' <p> Also like mastery learning , OBE is not concerned with when children learn a subject . In Mr. Spady 's favored formulation , schools should make time into a variable instead of time being a constant . ' OBE supporters can sound tough-minded on this point : students , they say , should not get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is , however , another option : holding students responsible for learning subjects by a specific time . It seems unlikely that OBE advocates would like the implication of rejecting timetables : that policymakers should not care if the children of the ghetto learn long division at the same age their suburban peers master analytic geometry . <p> OBE theorists are also hostile to what they call factoids . ' They want schools to focus more on higher-order thinking skills , ' less on rote memorization of facts , figures , and formulae ; they prefer active learning ' to passive learning . ' Oklahoma 's learner outcomes , ' published in 1992 , state : The longstanding preoccupation with computation and emphasis on rote activities must change to a focus on fostering mathematical insight , reasoning , and problem-solving both individually and in collaborative groups . ' <p> In a country where only a quarter of eighth-graders in 1990 could identify Lincoln 's main objective in the Civil War , the fear that schools are drilling too many facts into students ' minds may seem eccentric . Indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disastrous New Science ' and New Math ' curricula of the late Sixties . It is hard to see how students can apply higher-order thinking skills to a base of knowledge they do not possess . <p> As the report that Mr. Klaus co-authored with John Ritland for the Missouri Board of Education notes , discovered knowledge is not more intrinsically valuable to students than revealed knowledge : Civilization in the human sense depends on codified intergenerational teaching quite as much as on individual inquiry and discovery . Every person does not invent combustion . ' <p> Rote memorization teaches discipline : a child trying to learn his multiplication tables is also learning to concentrate on repetitive , non-stimulating tasks that are not necessarily fun . Furthermore , OBE 's favored active learning ' situations ( labs , field trips , etc. ) have a significant disadvantage : they tend to reduce instruction time , and U.S. schools already spend less time on instruction than those of any other industrialized country . <p> OBE 's disdain for specific knowledge leads its supporters to propose exceedingly vague outcomes ' as the basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , include the following outcomes : the student applies informed decision-making processes to promote healthy lifestyles ' ' ; understands the past and continuous development of societies and cultures in human history ' ' ; and comprehends , interprets , and evaluates information received through reading , listening , and viewing . ' <p> Missouri 's proposed standards have been designed to apply equally to all disciplines and age groups . But a first-grade English student and a twelfth-grade math student can meet the same standards only if the standards are highly abstract . And so they are : students will be expected to make decisions that are informed , reasonable , and responsible ' ' ; to work individually and with others to solve problems ' ' ; and to plan effective verbal and non-verbal communications for a variety of purposes and audiences , anticipating the impact of the message . ' The state 's previous assessment system had much more specific goals : tenth-graders , for example , were to solve problems requiring the application of the Pythagorean theorem ' and to predict consequences in given situations where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The new OBE goals , in contrast , do not imply the mastery of a specific body of learning at a particular age . <p> It is unclear how the states can ensure that students have attained such amorphous outcomes . ' Some critics fear that the subjectivity of many OBE goals opens the door to arbitrariness and abuse . Missouri 's standards , for instance , require teachers to judge whether a student 's personality helps a group to solve problems and whether he has accurately predicted the impact of his communications . <p> Other standards are clearly affective rather than academic : an Ohio high-school graduate is to function as a responsible family member ' and maintain physical , emotional , and social well-being . ' Kentucky students are to demonstrate positive strategies for achieving and maintaining mental and emotional balance . ' The Virginia Department of Education proposed that state schools enable students to play seven life roles ' ' : fulfilled individual , ' supportive person , ' lifelong learner , ' expressive contributor , ' quality worker , ' informed citizen , ' and environmental steward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against administering the state 's new OBE-influenced assessment system because of concern that it measured affective rather than academic goals . One of the tests , for example , asked eighth-graders to describe the ideas , questions , or opinions ' elicited by an excerpt from Richard Wright 's Black Boy and to use symbols , images , drawings , and/ or words to represent ' events in the excerpt . Sue Stokka , a member of one of the dissenting school boards , charges that teachers under OBE would be practicing mass therapy , and without a license . That 's an infringement of parents ' rights , not to mention the child 's . ' <p> Other critics fear that the schools will impose liberal values on children . Mrs. Schlafly , for instance , objects to Oklahoma health learner outcomes ' such as , the student will identify different types of family structures , so that no single type is seen as the only possible one and , the student will . . . be able to talk with one 's actual or potential partner about sexual behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are especially troubling , given the limited ability of elementary-school students to handle complex ecological issues before mastering basic science . <p> Mr. Spady responds to such criticism by observing that schools have always inculcated values : There is no way we are going to keep values out of the education process . Choosing a curriculum is a value process . ' Many OBE critics concede that as adult authority figures , teachers necessarily express judgments and convey values . But those judgments and values have never been the basis for student evaluations . Chester Finn , an assistant secretary of education under Reagan now at the Edison Project , notes that many parents want help from schools in teaching their children values  --  and that 's fine , as long as nobody has to attend the schools against their will . ' School choice is the only way to deal with such conflicts . <p> CONTROVERSIAL content aside , the very multiplicity of standards under OBE may undermine accountability . Missouri has a list of 41 proposed standards ' ' ; Ohio has 24 outcomes ' ' ; Kansas has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state indicators . ' ( Imagine looking at a report card broken down into 95 categories , as one Colorado school 's was . ) The number and vagueness of standards make it impossible to compare schools in a district , districts in a state , or states in the nation  --  or even to track the progress of any of those units over time . <p> That may be the point . While educational theorists provide the intellectual justification for OBE , it owes its political force to state education bureaucracies and teachers ' unions . Individual teachers often oppose it , both on principle and because of the added paperwork it entails . But the National Education Association is solidly behind OBE ; and while Al Shanker of the American Federation of Teachers fears OBE will ultimately undermine support for public education , local AFT affiliates often appreciate the additional funding that OBE brings . <p> Whatever its ideological appeal , OBE clearly serves the interests of the education establishment . New assessment systems will change what goes on in the classrooms  --  as educational theorists often say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . OBE changes the terms of a debate the education establishment has been losing . For years , assessments have shown educational achievement declining or stagnating in tandem with massive spending increases . OBE allows the longstanding enemies of academic standards to co-opt the standards movement  --  indeed , to become its leaders . <p> Supporters of OBE have made much of the fact that resistance to OBE has come disproportionately from fundamentalist Christians . In September 1993 Matthew Freeman of People for the American Way told Education Week , I would n't describe everyone opposing outcomes-based education as part of the religious right , but the national organizations taking it on are almost exclusively religious-right organizations . ' Carol Brzeczek , a member of the Littleton , Colorado , school board who voted with the majority to throw out the district 's OBE-influenced graduation requirements , disputes the implication . During the election , she says , people certainly made an effort to make it seem like we were all fundamentalists , but it was n't true . They kept calling us stealth candidates , as if we had some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools and the way they were headed . ' <p> Mr. Freeman and Mrs. Brzeczek are both correct . Opposition to OBE cuts across religious and political lines , but it has fallen to the Christian Right to organize it . The Democrats have more or less ceded control of education policy to the NEA , and Republicans have punted on the issue . Parents who want sane education policies therefore have nowhere else to turn . OBE has thus become a useful recruiting device for the Christian Right . In Missouri , for instance , conservative Christians are forming groups all over the state , packing rooms with over 500 parents , a year before implementation of OBE. <p> As newcomers to politics , many OBE opponents have made missteps . Mr. Finn says , I think that the people objecting to OBE are as wrong in many respects as the people coming up with these dippy outcomes . ' Some opponents focus on peripheral issues that generate paranoia ( like the alleged dangers of a federal data base keeping track of all students ' attitudinal outcomes ' ' ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the religious Right are objecting to analytical reasoning , critical thinking , independent analysis  --  all the higher-level skills most of us think of as the purpose of education . ' But other OBE foes avoid those pitfalls . In California , for instance , Mrs. Stokka rejects OBE partly because it hinders the development of the skills that Mr. Finn emphasizes . <p> Mr. Finn worries that the backlash against OBE could endanger worthwhile reforms . In particular , he fears that OBE 's dippy outcomes ' could discredit the idea of raising educational standards , in which case we will find ourselves back in an era where education is evaluated by its spending levels and its class size and its inputs and its intentions rather than by what kids learn . ' As a practical matter , however , the ease with which the education establishment has hijacked the movement for higher standards may suggest that would-be reformers should push for decentralizing reforms , enlisting market forces rather than state bureaucracies to raise standards . <p> A more troubling feature of the resistance to OBE is that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent of suburbanites , according to a 1993 Gallup poll ) are satisfied with their kids ' schools and do not want a shake-up  --  which makes any sweeping changes , including those conservatives favor , a hard sell . Yet this consideration underscores the importance of resisting OBE : it would deprive conservative reformers of the statistics they need to end that complacency . For the same reason full-blown OBE would make radical education reform more difficult to achieve , however , it would also make it more imperative . For years , the education establishment has said no to vouchers , arguing that public education should be improved instead . Now it is supporting efforts to deny parents and taxpayers the knowledge to do so . <p> The resistance to OBE surprised the education establishment , which is accustomed to dismissing grass-roots pressure . It has responded with more terminological evasion . Just as mastery learning ' became outcome-based education , ' OBE has assumed a variety of new names , including performance-based assessments . ' Writing in the May 1994 issue of Science Teacher magazine , John Kudlas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innovation ' OBE. ' Use results , objectives , goals , expectations , or something similar . Using the term ' OBE ' can attract unwanted criticism . ' <p> By RAMESH PONNURU <p> <p> Mr. Ponnuru , NR 's editorial assistant , is a senior at Princeton University . <p>
