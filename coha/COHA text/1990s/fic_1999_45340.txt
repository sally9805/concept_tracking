Sioux City ( AP ) . Bishop Aloysius Francis Wyatt , has declared in a pastoral letter that any Catholic belonging to organizations such as Rainbow Girls , Eastern Star , or Call for Action , a group advocating for women priests , will be excommunicated effective May 1 , 1996 , unless they sever ties with those groups . The bishop said that priests should not give communion to anyone wearing Call for Action buttons or Eastern <p> star pins . Nadine drove up to Mom 's house and parked in the driveway . When she got out , she looked across the street at Our Lady of Good Council Catholic Church , a low blonde-brick structure built ten years ago . Nadine turned around and saw Mom standing , leaning against her cushioned stool in front of the living room picture window , looking through her binoculars . When Nadine opened the side door , she smelled bread and saw three loaves lined up on the counter under a white cotton towel . Mom knew how she loved to slather butter and raspberry jam on those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting . Mom still had the heavy binoculars to her eyes . She was watching the people going into the church . On hearing Nadine come in , she put them on the windowsill and reached for her eyeglasses on the console TV . Then she turned to Nadine , who set down her suitcase in the doorway to the living room . " Had to see who was in the wedding party . It 's going to be a big one , " Mom said . Mom extended her hand for Nadine to shake , but Nadine moved in closer to hug her . Mom blushed and patted her lightly on the shoulders , keeping an arm's-length away . " If you want to go over and watch the rehearsal , go ahead . I can take care of myself , " Nadine said . Mom used to decorate the altar , but she 'd given that up ten years ago . Still she checked up on what the women were doing and she used that as an excuse to go into the sacristy and watch whatever was happening . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had the flu a couple days ago . " " Well , maybe you should go to bed , rest a little . " " I will , but do n't rush me . Let me see how you 're doing . " Mom stepped back and studied her . " What 's with the button ? " " You know , it 's that group I belong to that wants women priests . " Mom shook her head . " Now Nadine , do n't you be causing any trouble . " " What do you mean by that ? " " You know what I mean . The bishop said you ca n't belong to that . " " Hah , " Nadine laughed and shrugged . " Nadine , the bishop is the law . You have to obey him . " " I do ? " " Did you come home just to stir things up ? " " I always come to see you when schools out , and if things get stirred up while I 'm here then so be it . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes and already I 'm mad . " " Ma , go make us some tea and cut some of that bread . " Nadine picked up her suitcase and carried it to the guest bedroom . Nadine had grown up on the farm that Mom had sold after Dad died of cancer . This twenty-year-old house , new when Mom moved in , was still strange to Nadine . She lifted her suitcase onto the bed and opened it . She looked up above the bed and saw the newspaper photo taken when she 'd won an award for her work with the women 's shelter . Mom had put it in an old frame . Thank God , Mom had taken down the photo of her in her black habit on the day she 'd made her solemn vows . For two years after she 'd left the convent , the photo had been covered with a black drape , just like the statues of the saints were covered in church for Good Friday . Nadine put her clothes into the top drawer of the bureau , feeling stiff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning she 'd turned in her grades to the registrar 's office and had packed up and driven two hundred miles through corn and soybean country to get here . The next morning , when Nadine opened her bedroom door , she heard the sound of the drapes being pulled open . She entered the living room , tucking her white blouse into her denim skirt . " I 'm going to mass . " " You ca n't wear that thing . " Mom pointed to her button . " Yes , I can . " " You ca n't embarrass us . " " I 'm not embarrassing anybody but me . " " Well , he wo n't give you communion . " Nadine looked at her mother-so afraid to break any rule . She 'd be damned if she 'd kowtow like her mother did to those priests . She remembered how her mother had gone to the priest to get permission to have a hysterectomy . Nadine was nine years old and had been confused as to why a priest should know more about surgery than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was n't the reason at all . " She 's still bleeding , so she has to ask the priest if she can have the operation . " Still Nadine was baffled . " But why ? " she wailed . " Because it 's preventing the birth of a baby , " her aunt said . That had stuck with her for years . What if the priest had said no-then Mom might have died of uterine cancer . " I 'm leaving now . " Her mother was dressed in navy knit pants with her pink pajama top still on . Her mother had been wearing pants ever since she had been given her first baby-blue knit pants by her daughter-in-law twenty years ago . Nadine always told her older sister Doris that if they had given those pants to Mom she would have made them take them back to J.C . Penney 's and buy her something decent , like a housedress , but because it had been a daughter-in-law , the wife of her eldest son , she had felt obligated to wear the pants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could see the imprint from the garters of her girdle through the knit fabric . That was when Doris had said , " You have to get panty hose , Ma . " The next day Mom had gone to the Montegomery Ward 's in Emmetsburg , a bigger town twelve miles away , to buy her first pair of support panty hose . That had been a shock to the family who thought Mom would always clean chickens and hoe the garden in her girdle . But now she loved those pants , and sometimes her daughters had to force her to wear dresses for special occasions . Mom had her rosary beads in one hand and her cane in the other . She was walking back and forth from the stained-glass window in the living room to the kitchen counter . She had bought the stained-glass window at the auction of the furnishings of the old church because it had been dedicated to her father . At the bottom of the window were the words : In Memory of Dominic Frederick LaTour 1938 . And then Mom had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the east side of the living room . Rolph had fixed the rotting casings and done what she asked . So there in her living room , every morning when the sun came up , stood the unsmiling and sneaky-looking Good Shepherd , holding a white lamb . The whole family had been embarrassed by this religious display , but they had n't been able to stop Mom . Nadine stood by the back door of the kitchen , tying the belt of her trench coat about her . It had begun raining in the night . The last thing she did was take the Call for Action button off her blouse and pin it on the lapel of her coat . Mom crossed herself a few more times and mumbled prayers to herself . Nadine thought she 'd be able to get away without any more fuss , but just as her hand was on the doorknob , Mom came shuffling forward with her cane in one hand . " I ca n't let you . I ca n't . All my years of work for the church will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't bring that up again . I 'm doing this on my own . " Mom , five foot and shrinking , stood in front of the door . " Take the button off . " She said it like she meant it . Nadine shook her head . " I 've had this on my coat for months . " " I do n't care . Take that button off . " Mom 's voice trembled . Nadine stood there for a minute , deciding what to do . She watched Mom to see if she was putting on an act . " I know , Ma , you ca n't ever make a stand against the Church , I know that . But I 'm different . I can . " " Oh , you 're different all right . You think its perfectly okay to break vows . " " Ma , let it go , " Nadine said . " I wo n't let it go . You broke that vow that you would be a nun for the rest of your life . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's in the past . " " Well , it 's as fresh in my mind as if it happened yesterday . Your decision to break your vows about killed me . " Nadine shook her head . " Just leave it alone . " She stepped to the door . " I 'm going . " Ma shook her finger like she was back teaching country school . " Take that button off or you 'll be excommunicated . He knows you . He knows me . " Nadine reached up and unpinned the button . " There , " she said , trying to control her anger . " Do n't you know that during our lifetimes we are never going to see it happen-women wo n't be allowed to become priests . Just accept it . " " You can accept it , Mom , but I wo n't . " " Why do you always have to make such a big production of things ? I 'm an old lady and I want to live out my final days in peace . " " Then tell that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to blame , not me . " Nadine held the two-inch button and looked at the red letters-Call for Action . Masses of women should say the Mass . When she tried to slip it into her coat pocket , the button slipped from her hand and fell to the floor at her mother 's feet . No one moved . Mom was n't leaning down to get it . She acted like it was an object that would hurt her if she touched it . Nadine wanted to go out that door , but Mom stood in front of it . " Please move . I 'll be late . " Mom stepped aside , but her cane knocked the button across the kitchen floor . Nadine pulled the door open and headed out . She turned at the corner of the house and rushed across the street . She was glad to be out of there . Sometimes she felt sorry for her mom because she was a puppet , and other times she hated her for her blind obedience . She reached into her pocket and pulled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entrance , she pinned the button on her lapel . So let Mom think she took off her only button . Well , she had ten more at her apartment in Sioux City and always carried an extra one in her pocket . Nadine remembered that when six years after her vows she 'd taken off her veil and put on regular clothes , Mom felt cheated . She said then , " You have shrunken in my eyes . I do n't consider you a whole nun . " And when Nadine left the convent , Mom felt betrayed . She quit writing or calling her . There was silence for two years . That hurt , but Nadine learned to get over it . No , she was lying to herself . She 'd never gotten over it , and now twenty years later it was festering sore . She had gone back to school after leaving the order and had gotten her master 's in social work . She was not only a teacher but a community planner . She volunteered at the battered women 's shelter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were talking about women priests and deacons . This was n't something new ; she 'd been part of this group for fifteen years . Lately she was depressed . Things in the Church seemed to be going backwards , getting more conservative . Why the bishop let that sect of Pre-Vatican II Catholics have their Latin mass each Sunday was baffling to her . But the worst was his ridiculous announcement that he would excommunicate all Catholics who belonged to a list of organizations , some as benign as the Rainbow Girls who did service projects for the community . Yet on that list there was no mention of the Neo-Nazi party , which was headquartered a few blocks from the chancery , or of those groups that were promoting assault weapons . No mention either of the Posse Comitatus , which she 'd heard had meetings at the old gun club along the Missouri river , and she knew a couple of ushers and a deacon who belonged to it . She walked into church and sat in the middle aisle . She waited for mass to begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attended mass on a daily basis . They were good people but they were like sheep , followers and pleasers . And they loved their pastor , an old guy who was the bishop 's classmate and buddy . He was one of the priests who had publicly announced both from the altar and in the bulletin that he would not give communion to anyone wearing buttons for Call for Action or Rainbow pins . But then he could act tough because he knew he did n't have any parishioners who belonged to these groups . She dug into her pocket of her coat and pulled out a button , one she 'd made herself . It said , Be an American . Support assault weapons . Join the NRA . She knew Father Molloy belonged to the NRA , and he was always harping on the fact that we had a constitutional right to bear arms . Then she pulled out another button that she 'd made , an IRA pin . It was commonly known that Father was 100 percent Irish and had some distant relatives in County Cork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have one good word to say about the British or the peace process . But then he did n't have one good word to say about women who wanted to be deacons and priests either . When it came time for communion , she waited for the other women to go first . She wanted to be at the end of the group so if there was a commotion , she would n't have denied the others communion . She stood up and walked slowly to the end of the line . There were three more ahead of her and she was ready , ready more than ever for this . Then she heard some commotion in back and Father Molloy looked up from giving communion . She saw that he gave communion to the woman right in front of him without even looking at her because his eyes were on the rear of the church . When she heard a shuffle and a tapping with a cane , she turned to see Mom , a coat thrown over her pajama top , coming forward . Mom saw her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motioned for Father to come back to give her communion . Father motioned for her to stop ; he would go back there . He was n't looking at Nadine when he mumbled , " Body of Christ , " and put the communion in her hand . He had n't even glanced at her buttons . Father hurried up the center aisle to where Mom was waiting in the fifth pew from the back . She was seated now with her cane at her side . Nadine walked back through the side aisle to Mom 's pew . When she got nearer , Mom did n't even look at her . She kept her head lowered and moved her lips . Nadine sat in the pew beside her . When mass was over with , Mom turned and mumbled under her breath . " Get away from me . I do n't want to be seen with you with all those buttons on . " " And what about you ? " Nadine said , looking at Mom 's buttons of Our Lady of Fatima and St. Jude , saint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car badge that had sticky tape on the back . Mom had gotten it from the St. Augustine Indian Mission gift shop . " Mine are the right kind . " When a few women stopped and said hello to her mom , Nadine turned so they could see her buttons . Lillian Lammers , Mom 's best friend , adjusted her glasses and looked at Mom 's coat and then at Nadine 's . " My , you both have lots of badges on . " Lillian leaned toward Nadine 's coat . She took off her glasses and peered at Nadine 's chest . " Women will make good priests , too , " she read aloud . " Oh , my , is n't that one of those kind that you 're not supposed to wear , Pearl ? " She turned toward Mom , putting her glasses back on her head . Her face showed her nervousness . " You ca n't get communion if you wear that , " she whispered to Mom . Nadine smiled and said , " I just received communion . Guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you both have so many things on you ? " Lillian asked Mom . " You guys having some kind of contest to see how many things you can put on your coats ? " Nadine began to help Mom down the aisle and Lillian stood on the other side , in case she 'd trip . " Let 's get out of here , " Mom mumbled , wobbling as she walked . They were nearing the door when Father Molloy , in his black cassock , came down the middle aisle and headed toward them . " Oh no , " her mother mumbled , trying to move faster . " Take off that coat , " she hissed at Nadine . Nadine saw that Mom was sweating ; her upper lip with a few black hairs was covered in moisture . When Father got near them , he said , " Well , you 're up bright and early , Pearl . I thought you were still under the weather , but I see you could n't stay away . " Lillian Lammers started coughing like she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church . " Smoking too many of those cigarettes , hey Lily ? " he asked . " She 'll be okay once she gets outside , " Mom said , moving toward the door . Father looked at Nadine . " Do n't you two ladies come together anymore ? " " I told her to stay home , but she decided to come anyway . " Father looked at Nadine with a funny expression on his face . " What 's that stuff you 're wearing ? " Her mother stopped and Lillian did , too . Both turned around . Nadine looked at Father . " It 's my Call for Action button , an NRA button , and an IRA one . " Father looked at them from the bottom of his bifocals . " Did n't you hear that you can get excommunicated for that ? " Nadine said , " For the NRA button ? I heard you belong , Father . I guess you do n't mind that all sorts of crazies use assault weapons to slaughter children on playgrounds . " He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mean the NRA button . " " Oh then , the IRA one ? Are n't your relatives in it ? " " You know what I mean . Did n't you read the bulletin last week ? " " I was n't here . " " Well , you wear that again and I wo n't give you communion . " Nadine smiled . " You did this morning . " Lillian was pushing Pearl , who was mumbling , " Oh Lord , " down the aisle , toward the door . " So you wore this just to test me , is that it ? " His bald head had turned pink . " I suppose you could say that . " " Well , I 'm tired of cafeteria Catholics like you , thinking you can pick and choose what you want to believe . " His head quivered while he bit off each word . " You wear that tomorrow and you wo n't get communion . And I 'd advise you , while you are visiting your mother , to have some consideration for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the center aisle heading toward the altar . His steps were short and fast , like he was in a big hurry . Nadine walked toward the door . Once outside she saw that Lillian and her mother were almost home . As Nadine neared them , she heard sobs coming from Mom . When she got inside the house , she saw Lillian was helping Mom take off her coat . " I want to go to bed , " Mom said . Nadine came forward . " Here , I 'll help with her now , " she said . Mom hissed , " Do n't you get near me . You 've shamed me . " Nadine could see Mom 's hurt . God , now they would probably have another silent battle . Nadine figured it would take Mom another couple years to get over this one . But then she did n't know how many years Mom had left . Lillian helped Mom into bed and turned on the electric blanket . When Nadine saw that Mom was settled , she packed her suitcase and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seven miles south of town . She sat on the deck that overlooked the west branch of the Des Moines River . The fields of soybeans and corn in the bottomlands had about a month of growth , and from a distance she could still see the rows of green against the black soil . Give the crops another two weeks and soon they would be a mass of green , filling out and spreading over into the black rows . Doris came out and handed her a glass of wine . " What should I do about her ? " Nadine asked . " All I know is that you come home and get her all riled up and then I 'm left trying to calm her down when you leave . " " You know I do n't mean to do that . Why is it we let old people get away with murder ? " " Probably because we had it beat in our heads to respect our elders . " Doris walked over to the bird feeder nailed to the rail and scattered the chaff over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high water . We respect them even if they are downright nasty . " " I guess so . You know you are never going to change Mom at this point in her life . " Nadine stood up and walked over to the rail and looked out to the river . " Are those deer ? " Doris answered . " Yup , and you 'll see a lot more . At dusk they come up to feed . We leave corn for them down by that big oak . " Nadine stood there counting-seven , eight , nine deer-and she wondered how many more were still back in the trees bordering the river . She turned around and faced Doris . " So if I 'm never going to change her , then I 'd better figure out a way to live with her . " Doris nodded . " Just do n't get all political with her . Gosh , I guess I do n't discuss much with her , just the town gossip . That 's about all that 's safe anymore . You know , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When she 's mad at you , Nadine , which seems to be most of the time , she takes it out on me . She tells me I spend too much money on my antiques , and Al and I should n't go on our weekend jaunts to Omaha . I get it all the time . " " Sorry . " " I wonder how much longer she has in that house , too . You know she 's forgetting more and more . Last Wednesday I stopped by and she had the oven on and the door opened to warm up the kitchen . Well , no wonder the house was cold . She had the air conditioner going full blast and she did n't know she 'd turned it on . " The sun was almost down in the west and a breeze from the south rustled the leaves on the oaks on the hill . " I 'm going in to see her in the morning and I 'm going to settle this thing once and for all . " Doris grinned . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she got to Mom 's she did n't see her at the window with her binoculars . Nadine tried to open the side door but it was locked . Mom locked the door at night , but she always got up at six in the morning and opened it . Nadine knew where the key was in the garage , hooked on a nail under the workbench . The house was quiet when she let herself in . Too quiet . She felt her heart start racing as she ran toward the bedroom . Just as she reached out for the door , the door flew open and Mom was standing there all dressed , ready for church . " Ca n't an old lady have some privacy ? " " Ma , it 's time we talked . " " Talk ? I do n't want to talk . What you did is said and done , and I do n't have a daughter named Nadine . " Nadine stomped her foot . " Dammit , are we going to go through this again ? Will you ban me for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time . " " I got lots of time . " " Ma , you 're eighty-four years old . " " And my mother lived to be ninety-four . I figure I got ten more years . " Nadine followed Mom into the kitchen . " So you want to keep up the fight ? " " I did n't start it . You did . " " Okay , I started it . Well I 'm here to finish it . " Mom filled the teakettle with water and set it on the stove . Nadine stood right there near the counter and said , " I 'm sorry about yesterday . I should n't have used your church for my battle . " " You 're right . You should n't have . " " I 'm asking for forgiveness . " Mom said , " Huh . " She walked into the living room and pulled back the drape and sat on her stool . She reached for her black prayer book wrapped in a band of elastic that she 'd cut from an old pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of holy cards from funerals of relatives and friends . Mom pulled one out and began reading . " Ma , did you hear me ? " " I heard , but I 'm not forgiving you . " Mom was reading aloud , the words running together like it was a chant . Nadine stood there for a few seconds more . The teakettle was boiling , and she heard the whistle on it . She 'd given Mom that whistle kettle last year when she 'd fallen asleep and let the old teapot boil dry on the stove . The neighbor had come over to see her and had discovered it-red hot . She went over to the stove and turned off the burner . She found the green tea and made Mom a cup . She picked out a Lipton 's tea bag for herself . Nadine sat at the kitchen table sipping her tea . Finally Mom put her prayer book away and took her cane , hobbling over to the stove where her cup of tea sat . She picked it up and took a sip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong with us . You really wanted a priest but your boys did n't come through for you . So you got a nun instead . And when that fell through , you felt cheated and angry . " Mom did n't say a word . She just stood there , her back to Nadine , using the stove for her table as she took a drink and set it back down . " You have resented me for years . You know , I keep feeling like I do n't matter to you . You ca n't accept me as just Nadine , your daughter . " Mom 's hands trembled . " I have no daughter named Nadine . " Nadine looked up . " And how long have you felt that way ? " " Since you humiliated me by leaving the convent . " " And did you ever consider that maybe I was n't happy there ? That I found out that that life was n't for me ? " " Oh , I do n't want to hear it . You broke my heart when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You were going to be a mother superior and run your order . And instead you turn out like this . A rabble-rousing old maid . " " Old maid . Is that what you think of me ? " " Yup . You have n't done anything with your life . You do n't have kids and you 're not a nun . You just spend your days making trouble for the Church . Well , maybe we do n't want you . " " Ma , let 's get away from that issue . That just clouds things . Let 's talk about us . " Well , as far as I 'm concerned there ai n't nothing for you to come back here for . " " So you ca n't just get to know me because I 'm your daughter ? Ca n't you go back to before I ever thought about being a nun , to when I was a little girl ? Remember the time I fell from the big swing and got the wind knocked out of me . You thought I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put a cold cloth on my head . You know what ? I remember that my head was in your lap . That 's the only time I ever remember you hugging me like you meant it . The only time . " " I still think you were faking that . It was just a stunt to get some attention . " Mom 's back was still away from her . " It was n't . But let 's say it was . Was it really so bad to get my mother 's attention ? Was it ? " Nadine asked . There was silence . Nadine went on . " And you know what , I have used that single scene my whole life . Whenever I try to tell myself that Mom still cares for me , still loves me , I bring back that scene . It 's all I have . " Mom turned . " There you go again . I remember hugging you when Dad and I left you in Dubuque at the convent . " Nadine looked up . " Mom , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then you did . There was no hug . Not one single hug . " " You 're just saying that to make me mad again . Always blaming me . " Nadine stood up this time . " No , I 'm not saying it to blame you . I 'm just saying it because it 's true . " " I do n't want to hear it . I do n't want to hear anything . " Mom hobbled out of the kitchen without her cane , heading toward her stool by the living room window . Nadine followed after her . Mom climbed onto her stool and cried out , " Get away from me . Just get away . " Nadine stood in the doorway to the living room for a second . She watched Mom 's back move up and down . Then she did what she did to the women who came into the shelter . She came right up behind that stool and threw her arms around Mom and pulled her close to her . For the first time ever she felt Mom 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pull away , leaning forward , but Nadine held her tightly . " Ma , I want us to start over . I know you 're going to say it 's too late but it is n't . I want you to see me as I am . You know I am more like you than you think . I pray and help people . You know , what I 'm doing right now-hugging you-is what I do to the abused women who come into the shelter . When they 're scared and lonely , I just hug them . " " I do n't need any damn hug . I 'm not an abused woman . " " Ma , I 'm offering you this chance to get to know me . I want to know you , too . And she put her lips to the top of Mom 's head ; her gray hair was thin on top . She kissed her head softly . " I know you ca n't look at me . So I 'm going to leave here and go back to Doris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow . But I want you to know that I 'm offering myself to you . I 'm willing to try and change things between us . " There was silence . Nadine let go of Mom and stepped back . Mom 's back was still stiff . She was staring straight ahead , out the window . The sun was shining through the stainedglass window of the Good Shepherd and the red light from his robe spread a red light all over Mom 's body . Nadine turned and walked toward the kitchen door . When she opened the door , she heard the voice . " Nadine ? " She paused . " Nadine , " she heard again . She turned around and walked toward the living room . " Yes , Ma . " " If you 're going to be driving by here later , drop off some of those radishes and lettuce from Doris 's garden . " " What ? " " You heard what I said . " " Radishes and lettuce ? " " And you might as well clean them up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nadine asked quietly . " Well , you ca n't leave lettuce to wilt . " " Ma , what are you saying ? " Nadine watched Mom working her jaw , like the words were being chewed and spit out . " I 'm saying bring some lettuce for lunch . " " Whose lunch ? " " Good heavens , are you stupid ? Our lunch . " Nadine took a breath and said louder . " Are you inviting me to lunch , Mom ? " " Well , if you want to invite yourself , I wo n't stop you . " " Okay , okay . Lunch today . " Nadine let herself out the door and walked to her car . When she looked toward the picture window , she saw Mom , standing in front of her stool , bathed in a red haze from the sun shining through the Good Shepherd 's robe , looking at her through her binoculars .
