He 's fine , charming , well educated , the perfect catch  --  except for this one drawback : He 's gay . It used to be that all the good Black men were married . Today it seems they 're just as likely to be gay . No matter how wonderful , how attentive , how much a real friend the gay man is to a woman , he will never be her lover or husband  --  never " her man " in the straight sense of the word . With so many forces keeping Black men and women from coming together in meaningful relationships , male homosexuality can be just one more rub to our wounded interactions . But gay men , even those we consider our closest , dearest friends , also have problems with us , problems that they rarely voice . Many feel as though single Black women heap all the blame for the so-called man shortage on gay men . Others are afraid that if they talk openly and honestly about their homosexual lives and loves we 'll reject them , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some feel that straight women have n't done enough in the fight against AIDS , even as it steals away so many gay brothers . So what would two good friends  --  a straight woman and her gay buddy  --  say to each other if they had the chance to talk openly and honestly ? In this provocative dialogue , LaDonna and Malik , who have been tight for ten years , discuss the warm but sometimes rocky relationship between straight women and gay men . Let 's listen up . LADONNA : I care about you a great deal . But sometimes flashing through my mind is Is n't it a pity you 're gay . MALIK : You should n't feel sorry for me , I 'm not unhappy . Besides , being gay is just a small part of me as a whole . LADONNA : But that 's not I mean . Sometimes you and other gay men I know get flirtatious with me . With women . MALIK : But that 's because you 're the hottest woman around . LADONNA : See , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I care about you . You 're beautiful and smart , and I want you to know it . I 'm your friend and I want to build you up , make you feel good about yourself . I want to tell you , " You look good , girl . " LADONNA : But you 're also a man . I take that stuff seriously . Like last week when you invited me to John 's party . I did n't tell you this , but I just did n't want to go in and see all of these gorgeous guys talking to each other . I get frustrated . I get resentful . MALIK : You mean not talking to you ? LADONNA : Well , yeah . It 's nice to go to a party full of attractive Black men . It 's nice to see a sexy man , and to have him catch your eye . But at John 's parties , all the sexy men are there , but they 're not trying to catch my eye . MALIK : But are n't the conversations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 're always asking about you . LADONNA : That 's not enough . I 'm a woman in this society , and women have been conditioned to seek approval from men , even if it 's flirtatious , even if it 's a brief moment at a party . We are used to being affirmed by men approving us . So when a man flirts  --  any man  --  a woman thinks , Oh , he wants me . MALIK : Are you saying that you are sexually attracted to these guys , the gay men at the party ? LADONNA : Yes , at first . But you can be initially attracted to someone and then find out something about them , and then it changes , it turns you off . When I find out a man is gay , I 'm not attracted to him anymore . It 's like if I find out you 're a crackhead , I 'm not attracted anymore . If I find out you 're an alcoholic ... MALIK : Hey , that 's not fair . Being gay is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone who 's strung out on drugs . Just because I love differently from how you love does n't mean I 'm sick . We 're all unique , and my being gay is just one way I 'm unique . LADONNA : Why are you gay , do you think ? MALIK : I do n't know . No one knows what causes some people to be gay . But I think it 's one of those things like eye color that makes up an individual . LADONNA : So you really think it 's hereditary ? MALIK : Yeah . I know that ever since I can remember , I 've been attracted to men . Every part of society told me it was wrong , so I tried everything not to be . I dated women . I tried to completely block it out of my mind , I tried therapy . But my heart has a voice that speaks to me : Because it is part of who I am , I could n't make it go away . LADONNA : Once you 're gay , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , because I tried so hard to get rid of it , but I could n't . The only thing you can do is choose not to act on it . That 's not change , that 's discipline . What I did was turn off my sexuality and became someone I was n't . I still thought the same thoughts and felt the same feelings , I just did n't act on them and I felt depressed . LADONNA : That helps clarify things for me . But I still need to tell you what 's really bothering me about your being gay . It 's that you 're a smart , wonderful man , and we get along really well . And maybe if you were n't gay , we 'd be together . Maybe we 'd be married . MALIK : I would have married you . LADONNA : A lot of good that does me . MALIK : Maybe we would be together , but I 'm not straight . And maybe you would n't care so much about it if you had someone . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But in the meantime , you ca n't blame me . There are plenty of straight men out there , good straight men . Black women need to be secure in their choice of mates . You know , secure enough to date a plumber or carpenter . LADONNA : I 'd love to find a good plumber or carpenter . MALIK : You know this kind of thing is hard for me . A lot of sisters are out there looking , so I have a lot of women coming on to me . They think they can change me , or they do n't believe I 'm really gay . But this makes me uncomfortable . These women are trying to turn me into something I 'm not . They are n't respecting me for who I am , and it 's difficult because I really enjoy hanging out with women . LADONNA : Why do you have so many straight women friends ? MALIK : I love women . Women are more open than men , easier to talk to . I can confide in women . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have trouble showing their feelings . Also , we have a lot in common . My girlfriends sit around and say , " I 'd love to find me a good man , " and I say , " Hey , me too . " Let me ask you the same thing  --  why do you have so many gay male friends ? LADONNA : My gay friends are people I can count on . Solid friends . And there 's no sexual tension , so your ego is n't invested the same way it is when you 're in a heterosexual relationship . Gay men friends provide the kind of support that you get with a good girlfriend , but with an interesting twist : They 're men . That means they can be everything from your best girlfriend to your date . MALIK : But is n't that what your partner should be like anyway ? Why are n't your relationships with men like that ? LADONNA ; Because sex changes the dynamics of a friendship . The emotional stuff boils over . What you expect from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When a friend leaves your house , you do n't feel abandoned . MALIK : I know what you mean . Sexual relationships can be hard . Each person is positioning himself not to be hurt . You get afraid to confide in the other person ; you think , If I tell you everything , you can use it to hurt me . LADONNA : I know some gay men who have been in long-term relationships , but not many . It seems hard for two men to stay in a relationship . MALIK : The problem is that men have so much trouble talking to and confiding in each other that they connect through sex . Men find it hard to express affection and caring , so we express it in bed . LADONNA : Men , by nature or nurture , are more sexual . They are always on the lookout for the " big O. " MALIK : Women can express feelings through caring and talk , not always through sex . I wish I could find a man who 's masculine but also not afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  two women together  --  have the best long-term relationships . LADONNA : You know , sometimes that heavy sexual overtone of the gay-male community bothers me . I mean , when I went out to Fire Island a resort community in New York popular with gays , I could smell the sperm . MALIK : Are you jealous ? LADONNA : Of what ? MALIK : Of the freedom , of the sexual expression . LADONNA : Why would I be jealous of someone who could just drop their drawers anytime ? Any woman could do that . It 's called being a whore . Take the flamboyant sexuality of the Gay Pride Parade . Maybe I 'm being prudish , but could you imagine a bunch of porn queens marching in the Columbus Day Parade ? MALIK : Excuse me , have you been to Mardi Gras ? A bunch of straight men in pearls and bad drag ? LADONNA : You know what I mean . MALIK : On one hand , the media seems fascinated with the gay bars and parades , places where there is overt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been together 30 years ? But , on the other hand , that kind of overt sexual freedom is part of the gay culture . We are oppressed because of whom we love and whom we sleep with . In many states it 's illegal for same-sex couples to make love . So when we rebel against sexual oppression , it 's with sexual expression . Do you feel uncomfortable if I get into the details of my personal life ? LADONNA : Actually it 's always kind of illuminating , because so many things are similar . There are so many difficulties common to all relationships . People bring the same shit into relationships whether they 're gay or straight . Are there things about straights that make you really mad ? MALIK : You know , I have so many friends who are dying of AIDS , and sometimes I feel that straight Black people could n't care less . LADONNA : It 's the Black gay community that 's dropped the ball . White gays have rallied around AIDS and forced people to pay attention to it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vocal about it , and the least vocal are Black gays . They are still in denial , still in the closet , and they are the group that need to be in the forefront of the fight against AIDS . MALIK : But is n't that blaming the victims ? LADONNA : I was just thinking that . But still , how is the Black community going to develop any kind of support if the victims continue to lie and hide ? I had a friend who had AIDS for years and never shared that he was HIV-positive . He looked like death . I asked him point-blank if he had it , and he asked me why it is that when a gay man loses weight you think he has AIDS . Then he died a few months later of AIDS . I felt pissed . MALIK : But the reason we are so scared to come out is that we 're afraid to have our families and friends turn against us . Many of us stay in the closet rather than risk losing their love and acceptance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denies it , what can you do ? On a personal level you 've been shut out . MALIK : But why do you think we shut out straights ? Because we 've been hurt . So many gay people have been taunted and thrown out of families , have lost friends and been beaten up . We listen to antigay jokes and homophobic comments and hateful song lyrics , and it hurts most when it 's coming from other Black people . Now why are we going to trust you all with our innermost feelings ? LADONNA : I 'm not like that . MALIK : But so many others are . It 's up to cool people like you to talk to the homophobic ones . LADONNA : But if we do that , if we keep being tolerant , are we going to die out as a race ? MALIK : Women may be lesbians , but they can still have children . And we may be gay , but we 're still men and we can still make children . There are many Black gays , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so afraid of our being around children  --  they think we 're trying to recruit them to be gay or to abuse them . But studies show that children who grow up in a gay household are no more likely to turn out to be gay than those who grow up in a straight household . And that abuse thing is ridiculous : So many , many women are sexually abused by male relatives . But is anyone saving that straight men should n't be fathers or schoolteachers ? LADONNA : Maybe this is irrational , but I ca n't help feeling that if more and more men come out , there will be more and more women , young women , without men on a Saturday night . MALIK : Whether they come out or not does n't determine how people feel or who they 're attracted to . Those women who are alone do n't want a gay man . They do n't want to be spending their Saturday nights with someone who is n't attracted to them , who 's pretending . They want to find someone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that there are n't enough men for them on gay men . There are other factors keeping men from them : prison , drugs , AIDS . Energy would be better spent trying to solve those problems and bring more Black men into the pool than trying to force gay men to be something they 're not . LADONNA : You 're right . I love you . MALIK : I love you , too . LaDonna and Malik are the pseudonyms of two friends who live in New York City . Linda Villarosa is an ESSENCE senior editor . <p>
