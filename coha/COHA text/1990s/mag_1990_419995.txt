Landscape architect Roberto Burle Marx has long been a creator of designs that raise human awareness of plants , stone and water <p> Clemente Gomes and Roberto Burle Marx strolled through the exuberant garden they had created with Gomes ' money and Burle Marx 's genius , giving a solemn imitation of two white-haired old men on pensions . The garden belied their act . More than a dozen species of agave exploded in sharpened spikes on stone tiers to their right , and a column made of stacked millstones towered to their left . Dozens of palms soared , a Bombax malabaricum tree lifted magnificently skeletal arms to hold tufts of scarlet flowers , and water poured in shining , sibilant sheets from rectangular pools with lily pads the size of card tables . The two men walked slowly together , Burle Marx stout and Gomes wiry , and Gomes held the arm of his old friend , who is one of the world 's preeminent landscape architects , as delicately as if it were a precious vase . <p> Then the " vase " leapt out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Albert Einstein with his finger in a live socket , burst forth . " In the same way the indoors is linked to the garden , " he said , drawing the last word out , " the garden must be linked to nature ! " <p> Pensioners no more , Gomes and Burle Marx stood by the unfinished garden , Burle Marx waving his arms , talking slowly in English , talking rapidly in Portuguese and singing in Italian . " You must know the language of nature ! " Burle Marx proclaimed . " If you do not know the language you can not create a poem . " Gomes slyly murmured " Hello , " " Thank you " and " How are you ? " in Russian . All around them the garden bloomed extravagantly . " You see , " Burle Marx said in English , turning to me , " I am at home here . " <p> I recently followed Roberto Burle Marx from home to home  --  from garden to garden  --  for two weeks . I had come to see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history who is still making it : an extraordinary landscape architect who , from the beachfronts of Copacabana and Miami to the forests of the Amazon , has changed the way the people of Brazil and of other countries see and manipulate their surroundings . He pioneered the use of his country 's native plants in gardens he designed , and has argued for lonely years against the destruction of Brazil 's natural landscape . He creates gardens like jewels for his country 's wealthy elite and makes parks like alms for its poor . He is known for designing six kilometers of sidewalks at Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro ; the 70-hectare Parque del Este in Caracas , Venezuela ; the 120-hectare Flamengo Park in Rio ; and more than a thousand other parks and gardens in Brazil and elsewhere in the world . He has discovered 13 species of plants , 11 of which bear his name . He has received awards for his work from institutions in Belgium , Brazil , Canada , Chile , Great Britain , Italy , Nicaragua , the United States , Uruguay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes jewelry , he designs floral arrangements . Most of all he has devoted a lifetime to creating works that , like his garden on Clemente Gomes ' ranch , seek to establish a link of beauty between art and nature . <p> " Burle Marx and Larry Halprin SMITHSONIAN , December 1988 are the two great landscape architects in the world , " Ian McHarg , author of the book " Design with Nature " and a pioneer in ecological design , told me recently . " They are very different , but they coequally share that pedestal . " <p> " I often think of Burle Marx as the Frederick Law Olmsted of Brazil , " says Anthony Walmsley , a noted landscape architect based in New York , who worked with Burle Marx in 1962 . " The fact that he has put art back in the profession , or made it very central , has a universal effect on the profession . What is so significant about Burle Marx 's contribution  --  besides that it has lasted 60 years  --  is the way it has made an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Burle Marx is a survivor from the Renaissance , " says Lucio Costa , Brazil 's legendary architect , who designed , among other things , his nation 's first glasswalled skyscraper , in Rio , and created the plan for the capital city of Brasilia . " He is a musician who makes music with plants , " Costa says . <p> My encounter with Burle Marx was a pursuit from landscape to garden and back . At 80 years of age he is a Brazilian institution . In a country known for its exuberance , he is flamboyant . " He sings , he dances , he tells very funny stories , " McHarg said . In Brazil you see his face  --  big , robust , energetic , with wild , wavy white hair and a mustache  --  on magazine covers and in political cartoons . And always , you hear about his parties  --  " old ladies playing the piano inside , a sort of samba school in the garden and Roberto singing everywhere , " said someone who knows him  --  and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burle Marx began with the journey to Gomes ' vast ranch , to which I rode in the back seat of his club-cab diesel pickup at about 500 miles an hour . " It is so wonderful that you could come , " he said ; then we went careening through the streets of Rio , where Burle Marx pointed out huge tile wall murals he had done , his mosaic walkways at Copacabana beach and at Flamengo Park . We then hurtled south on the highways of Sao Paulo State , while Burle Marx sang opera , ate fried manioc balls , told the driver to stop when we passed flowering trees , exclaimed at the beauty of soap patterns when the driver washed the windshield , and mourned both the denuding of surrounding hills for coffee and cattle and the way Brazilians everywhere whitewash the first few feet of their shade trees . " They dirty them with white ! " he shouted over the diesel 's roar . He was pleased with the image . " Dirtied with white ! " <p> Later I spent time at Burle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hillside garden and greenhouses , which combined contain about 3,500 different species of plants . The building was full of tapestries , paintings , tile works , collections of religious icons , pre-Columbian pottery , wood carvings , jewelry and floral arrangements  --  a mixture of antiquity and Burle Marx 's own creations . Once we stood looking out across the bay at Guaratiba , and he spoke with the tones of a prophet : " In Brazil , we have more than 50,000 different plants and many plants that are still to be discovered ! We need to understand that we have overwhelming richness . " We looked at bursts of orchids , and he announced : " A garden must be constructed ; there must be a balance between all the plants and all the rhythms . But you need to know how to stress what you want to say . If you do n't know what you want to say it would be only an impulse . Art is impulse , but controlled impulse . " <p> He seldom talked about his past . " Roberto does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me once , while we stood in a garden Burle Marx had designed in the hills above Rio . Lawns rolled off into crowds of agaves studded with tufts of pampas grass , huge rare philodendrons stood in groves , and a stream of water slipped away down a hill to help the garden blend into the surrounding wilderness . The garden was 34 years old , in its maturity ; Burle Marx still visited it regularly to make sure it continued to express his goals . <p> It took a visit to a more reflective man to understand Burle Marx 's past . The man was Lucio Costa , who , at 88 , is the opposite of Burle Marx : quiet , undemonstrative , soft-spoken , modest . Costa is one of Burle Marx 's earliest acquaintances . They met when Costa was 17 and Burle Marx , the son of a German father and a Brazilian mother , was 10 . Costa recalled a child quieter than the man . " We lived on the same road , " he remembered when I visited him in his modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the back of their home , and his mother loved flowers , and he was very sensitive . He began like a flower himself . " " Weeds " of Brazil treated as treasures <p> The gardens of Brazil were European in style then , all roses and boxwood hedges . The magnificent tropical plants of Brazil 's jungles were considered weeds . Burle Marx , who now seems to take violent delight or umbrage at everything , loves the big irony of his early life  --  that he had to go to Germany to learn the value of Brazilian plants . His parents took him to Berlin in 1928 , when he was 19 , and he studied both opera singing and art ; but every day he was also drawn to visit the Dahlem Botanical Garden . " Roberto has a genuine affection for nature , " said Conrad Hamerman , a Philadelphia landscape architect who is writing a biography of Burle Marx . " It is a direct physical thing . " At the botanical garden , displays had been created around ecological associations of plants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as treasures . <p> " I did n't know if I would be a musician or a landscape architect , " Burle Marx said that afternoon in Clemente Gomes ' new garden , while Gomes sang " Deep in the Heart of Texas " in the background . " But in Germany when I began to see the botanical garden , I began to discover plants that I had never seen , and they were Brazilians ! On account of that I began to collect plants . " <p> Back in Brazil , Burle Marx enrolled at the National School of Fine Arts , which was briefly directed by Lucio Costa . He studied painting . It was a period of turmoil and revolution in Brazilian art . " It was a very special time , " Costa remembered . " We were trying to adapt architecture and art , because Brazil was very apart from what was happening in the rest of the world . " Burle Marx joined a circle of artists in many disciplines who embraced modern art and architecture . " Usually , " Costa remembered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditions . But the Brazilian modern art movement was not only a group of cosmopolitans trying to introduce modern contemporary things . They were also interested in the traditions of Brazil . " <p> While he studied painting , Burle Marx collected plants and , almost as a hobby , continued to work with his mother 's garden . Instead of roses and boxwood , he planted agaves and bromeliads , the plants of Brazil . <p> In 1932 Lucio Costa asked Burle Marx to design a garden for a residence in Rio . Two years later Burle Marx was appointed Director of Parks for Recife , the capital of the state of Pernambuco . There he seems to have found the connection between his passion for art and his love of nature that would drive him the rest of his life . He took the plants that most considered weeds and made parks with them . He designed one garden almost wholly around plants from the dry northeast , and others dominated by water and by a plant that would become one of his trademarks : Victoria amazonica , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the city and put " weeds " in them all . This was shocking . In at least one case he removed a patriotic statue . And the use of what seemed to be weeds was even more controversial . " He was a fighter , " Costa said . " He began as a fighter , exactly like Don Quixote . In the beginning he fought alone . " <p> Two years later Burle Marx came back to Rio a different person . He had found his means of expression , and that freedom released his ebullience . " I do n't know exactly how Roberto suddenly exploded , " Costa said . " It is something rather mysterious . Suddenly he is Roberto Burle Marx . At the beginning I always felt he wanted help . But , like a bird , suddenly he feels his wings are stronger . He flies . " " It became a must to call him <p> When Costa and a group of colleagues brought the ideas of Le Corbusier to Brazil in designing the new glass-walled Ministry of Education and Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to design the rooftop and surrounding gardens . " He had the plastic sensibility for disposing of masses and color , like a painter , " Costa said . After that endorsement , suddenly it was necessary to have every important new garden designed by Roberto Burle Marx . " It became a must to call him , " Costa said . " Each architect who had a fine building , or a supposedly fine building , asked him to compose , to elaborate , to value the building with a proper garden . " <p> A " proper garden " became a celebration of Brazil 's own tropical nature , full of rich colors and abundance . Brazil 's wealth of plant life was a weed patch no longer . Great swatches of vegetation were planted in curvilinear patterns that resembled the shapes in Burle Marx 's abstract paintings . " A peculiarity of his gardens , " Costa remembered , " is that he introduced the technique of painting ; he is a painter , and he paints with plants also . He makes huge pictures with native flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than paintings , " Anthony Walmsley said . " He has an extraordinary sense of sites and their potential . " No one design is the same . " I am always afraid of copying myself , " Burle Marx told me once . " If you copy yourself you do n't have any more imagination . " Still , there is an unmistakable style that reflects the abundance of Brazil 's natural vegetation , and the cultural impacts of its Portuguese and Indian heritages . <p> Burle Marx gardens are bold , rich , colorful . Lawns are sometimes planted in different species of grass , making long , clear edges of color and texture . Water flows from pool to pool , where great leafy ships of Victoria amazonica sail in fleets . Where paving is necessary , Burle Marx has adapted the traditional Portuguese use of mosaic tile to make shapes at the same time strong and whimsical . Today , walking on these plazas and sidewalks of curvilinear patterns is like strolling across fields of windswept sunlight and many-colored shade . <p> After his " explosion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became known worldwide . Ian McHarg remembers one of his first appearances at the University of Pennsylvania , several decades ago . It was a frigid , gray November evening . " The hall was absolutely jam-packed , " McHarg recalls . " People were sitting on windowsills , sitting in the aisles and crowding to put their heads around the door . Everybody was sort of wet , the radiators were gurgling , there was a good deal of steam . " The crowd gasped with delight <p> Into this gloom of grayness , Burle Marx brought slides . They were large-format slides and , projected , covered one whole end of the room . He read a brief introduction , then turned on the machine , McHarg remembers , and the whole room was suddenly illuminated by " incredible purple mountains , a viridian green forest and a thousand acres covered with yellow lilies . " The crowd gasped with delight . <p> The other characteristic fragment McHarg remembers is of a party that happened about 25 years ago in Chestnut Hill , a suburb of Philadelphia . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrating in a small house . Louis Kahn , the famous University of Pennsylvania architect ( SMITHSONIAN , JULY 1979 ) , is pounding on the piano . There is noise , music , smoke and laughter . And beside the piano , at the center of attention , with his shirt rolled up exposing his ample midriff , is Roberto Burle Marx . He is singing in Portuguese , German and French , and he is belly dancing . <p> Walmsley thinks that Burle Marx at 80 has slowed down a bit since those days . If so , it was barely perceptible to me . On another day we went dashing through the streets of Rio again , past the Botanic Gardens , with which Burle Marx often trades rare plants , to a ceramics factory , where he examined half a dozen 3-by-6-foot tile compositions he had designed , then back to his office in Rio 's Laranjeiras district , where a German television crew was waiting to make a film of him . There were eight desks in the office , each with designers at work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park for the state of Goias . Against three of the four a walls were stored hundreds of completed plans . They stood in tiers of vertical tubes , like organ pipes , holding the music of his many compositions . <p> " You see , " Burle Marx said , waving his arm . " Tubicular gardens ! " There are about 1,200 of them . Some of the designs have won awards ; many have never been done . Gardens are like movie scripts  --  sometimes the money to complete them is never raised . Among the host of tubes was a major project Burle Marx recently completed for the city of Miami for a major renovation of Biscayne Boulevard . That project , which will cost $16 million ( Burle Marx 's fee was $70,000 ) , is now under construction . <p> Parks for the public are clearly Burle Marx 's favorite form of expression . " Creating a garden for a couple , let us say , gives me a pleasure , " he said . " But it does n't fulfill my purpose , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a pleasure . Through a garden we can educate people . For a work of art , it does n't matter if you create a skyscraper or a jewel ; the important thing is that you do your best . But when the purpose is to educate people so they can have a better way of living , I prefer it . It gives me a much stronger feeling that we are trying to find the lost paradise . " <p> The huge window that made up most of one wall of the office looked out on an intimate scene of the backyards of homes . It was a closeup of tiers of buildings , trees , tightly laced bars on doors and windows , and slabs of sunlight on walls , cats , trees , garbage cans and window boxes . The next day , when I visited Burle Marx again at his estate outside Rio , I recognized many of the shapes and colors . They appeared  --  slabs of bright color crisscrossed by groups of black lines  --  in the abstract painting he was working on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16-year-old son of one of the gardeners . He slipped into intent , busy silence <p> Burle Marx worked fiercely , irritated by my presence . He became even more agitated by the arrival of three young journalists who wanted to arrange a photograph , in celebration of spring , of a seminude woman sitting on a Victoria amazonica . " The plant is beautiful by itself ! " he said after they left . While he worked , his helper went darting off on errands , leaping over potted philodendrons on the way . <p> I tried to get Burle Marx to talk about his past again , but he would have none of it , talking vaguely about his mother ( " Of course she loved plants " ) and then slipping into intent , busy silence . So I stopped asking questions and just watched , listening to the rough scratching of the brush on the canvas , while Burle Marx painted those crisscrossed bars , which struck me as a symbol of how constrained the colors of modern life have become . In the distance we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound of water falling in the garden . Burle Marx , who never married , recently deeded the garden to Brazil , so it is now cared for as a public treasure , with a staff of gardeners who will maintain it after his death . " If I do n't work every day I am nervous , " he said after a while ; " I 'm afraid I am going to die . " <p> Some of his intensity is directed at the damage he sees being done to Brazil 's natural beauty all around him . " I see destruction ; I see erosion , " he said one day as we hurtled along the highway north out of Rio . " I do not see renewal . " The state of the environment is one of the few subjects that does not give him joy . " It is a melancholy time for me , " Burle Marx said a little later , as we drove through industrial smog along a river . " I am old and have not found a solution . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance he gets . Years ago , when Walter Gropius , the founder of the Bauhaus school of architecture , visited Brazil , Burle Marx complained to him about the ugliness of some billboards . " Did you speak against that ? " Gropius asked him . Burle Marx answered no . Gropius chided him : " We have a moral obligation to speak against mistakes . " <p> The words stuck with him . They drove Burle Marx , with his combined love for art and nature , to speak out , not about the ugliness of billboards , but about the damage being done to the land . He is so well known as a spokesman for nature that some years ago a newspaper cartoon showed a tree yelling for help to escape an ax , and Burle Marx , in a cape , flying to the rescue . <p> The day after we returned from our breakneck trip to Gomes ' garden , Burle Marx  --  ten days before his 80th birthday  --  got up at 6:30 again and went zooming off to another ranch , where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was designing . But there a surprise awaited him . Burle Marx was quite a sight himself <p> The surprise hit as he stepped out of the car at a dusty wide spot in the road , far from the elegant ranch houses owned by his hostess . She is one of the few wealthy Brazilians , a woman named Aparecida Mattos , who owns land all over southern Brazil . She wore several pounds of gold and diamonds at her neck and wrists , but Burle Marx was quite a sight himself . He wore a blue striped shirt , a brown herringbone suit , and a red-and-green polka-dot tie . <p> When Burle Marx arrived at the viewpoint , even he was struck almost silent . Out there on the dirt were about 150 people , two television crews and , in tidy formation , the 28-piece band of the Second Battalion of Military Police of Juiz de Fora , which struck up a march as he got out of the car . <p> He was stunned . " I did not expect this , " he whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsteadiness seemed real . He leaned on Mattos ' arm and they walked up to a tall sign that was covered with a cloth . The band played " Happy Birthday . " A friend yanked down the cloth and there was the sign that would overlook the new garden : " Roberto Burle Marx ; to the Grand Master with Admiration and Friendship . " <p> The television cameras rolled , and suddenly , in this most unexpected situation , surrounded by adulation , police , aristocracy and hills beaten to dust by his hostess ' cattle , he was an environmentalist , arguing against the cutting of the Amazon forest and for the protection of Brazil 's landscape . He spoke with heartfelt urgency , passing on again the message of his life : the importance of linking art , nature and human beings in search of the lost paradise . <p> " We need to show the people that to love the country we need to protect what we have , " he said . " All the big countries  --  the United States , Germany , France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is not only Brazil . In Germany 30 percent of the forests are ill . Many plants in Canada are being destroyed by the acid rain that comes from the United States . I will plant trees on my 80th birthday to show what we need in this country is renewal . I will show the people that that is my wish , the renewal of the forest . All Brazilians should work to protect our flora and fauna . We have the moral obligation to fight the mistakes . " <p> Late in the afternoon , he went into the huge living room of the Mattos mansion and dozed off in a chair , while half a dozen members of the family sat around and whispered among themselves . I sat there with them , watching Brazil 's Don Quixote of art and nature snore in the elegant room . <p> " Roberto Burle Marx seems to have produced no successors , " McHarg had said once when I asked about the Burle Marx legacy . " But then , Frank Lloyd Wright never did either , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may very well be that these extraordinary people do n't produce successors . But he 's had a profound influence with everybody . " <p> " I think of Burle Marx as the Picasso of landscape , " Walmsley had said . " No one 's going to do exactly the same thing . But his influence will be immense . I am sure there will be retrospective exhibitions on and on , because the output is so extraordinarily large , diverse and impressive . But this universal spirit , the impulse , is what people will remember , rather than trying to reproduce the forms . They 'll remember this exuberant desire and ability to create things that are wonderful . " <p> The scene I remembered , as I watched Burle Marx sleeping , was that day at Clemente Gomes ' garden , with Gomes murmuring in Russian and doing a little shuffle dance while Burle Marx sang . He was at home there , with plants , water and nature all around him , his life still as ebullient as his landscapes . <p> " When I first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said . " Now I think of Mies van der Rohe : less is more . " <p> Gomes sang , " I do not walk alone . " <p> " Even in a man 's life it is beautiful to be born , " Burle Marx said , rolling the last words . " It is beautiful to grow ; it is beautiful to love ; it is beautiful to end , to die . If we do n't understand that rhythm of life , we wo n't understand the rhythm of nature . " <p> Gomes murmured , " Balance is for balance . " <p> " I hate formulas , " Burle Marx said . " I love principles . " <p> Clemente Gomes looked at him and said , solemnly , " You are a free man . " <p> By Michael Parfit <p> <p> The author , who wrote on Brazil 's rain forest in the November 1989 SMITHSONIAN , went to boarding school in Teresopolis , near some Burle Marx gardens . <p>            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
