<p> They had been rejected by everyone . Back in 1962 , all the big London recording companies had given the fledgling Four the thumbs down , recalls Beatles producer George Martin . <p> When Martin listened to the group 's demo tape , he understood why . The recording quality was " appalling , " he remembers , and the style of the songs not much better - " Over the Rainbow , " " Besame Mucho " and Fats Waller 's " Your Feet 's Too Big , " to name a few . Interspersed were some freshly penned tunes of their own such as " Love Me Do " and " P.S. I Love You . " <p> " Pretty rotten songs , really , " says Martin , adding with a good-humored emphasis , " and they still are . You could hear a certain vitality there , but it was pretty rough . Most people who first heard the Beatles thought they were n't much use .

Still , with not a great deal of enthusiasm , he agreed to meet the young Liverpudlian lads . <p> " It was kind of instantaneous , " Martin says . " We simply hit it off . I thought they were terrific . They were kooky . They were unusual . They were a little bit arrogant , but it was fun as well . " <p> The now-renowned producer , who has won multiple Grammy Awards ( most recently for Broadway 's " Tommy " album ) , Martin commands his own AIR Studios . Downstairs , the rock group Simply Red is recording a new CD . Others , such as Elton John , Lisa Stansfield , and Disney Productions ( for " The Lion King " ) have also made use of AIR 's facilities and , most of all , Martin 's musical guidance . <p> It is clear why the Beatles also took to him quickly . He is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a total lack of self-importance . <p> " I do n't think anybody except George Martin could have worked so closely for so long with the Beatles , " says a British actor who knew them all in the 1960s . " They would n't have trusted anyone else - and no one else could have put up with them . " <p> The bond remains strong . When asked if Paul , George , and Ringo have changed much over the years , Martin , who sees them regularly , says with obvious warmth in his voice , " I 've grown up with them . They 're my friends . " He pauses , then laughs : " And they 're still the same arrogant , opinionated devils they always were ; success has n't changed them in that regard !

Generally regarded by Beatle biographers as the " fifth Beatle , " he was vital to honing their work into a distinctive sound . <p> Martin explains that in the early days both he and the Beatles were keen to produce music that had the loudness of American rock-and-roll . No one in Britain had yet been able to match that kind of thumping noise . <p> The Beatles introduced Martin to the music of Chuck Berry , Carl Perkins , Bo Diddly , Jerry Lee Lewis , and Buddy Holly . Martin agreed their stuff was great , but the technology did not exist in Britain for anything remotely similar . Could he not have simply imported the hardware ? <p> " No , " says Martin , " because it 's not just technology . It 's a combination of the type of song , the type of arrangement , the type of singing , the type of playing , the instruments in the studio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it on a disc . " <p> They had to wing it . Using comparatively antiquated microphones and creaky four-track recording equipment - pop songs today typically use dozens of tracks - Martin came up with , for example , such revolutionary ideas as putting mikes very close to the drums and bass guitar . No one had done that before . For starters , the mikes could not withstand the enormous vibrations for any length of time . How did Martin manage ? <p> " We broke a lot of microphones , " he replies cheerily . " I mean , we damaged loads of equipment . " <p> But he finally helped create what they were aiming for - and more . Soon American producers and musicians were beating a path to Martin 's door trying to learn some of his secrets . <p> In fact , the Beatles ' number that cracked the all-important American market , " I Want to Hold Your Hand , " is a good case in point . When compared with the then Top-10 croony hits from , say , Bobby Vinton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seasons , the Beatles ' dynamic , up-front drums , the distinctive , rhythmic hand-clapping , the undisguised Liverpudlian-accented singing , the pulsating bass , came across as totally unique to early ' @x teenage ears - on both sides of the Atlantic . <p> " I was consciously trying to get a sound that grabbed you by the scruff of the neck and said : ' Listen to this , ' " Martin says . " With that song , it technically all seemed to knit together . " <p> In the beginning , the producer guided the Beatles on how to get the most from a song - how long to sing the chorus , where to end it , and so on . With " Ca n't Buy Me Love , " for instance , McCartney wrote it to kickoff with " money ca n't buy me anything to keep me satisfied . " <p> Martin explained to him that it had no impact . A song needed a hook , an opening grabber . " I said to him : ' Let 's start off with drums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two times . On the second repeat , I suggested changing chords . " <p> Martin sings as he describes it , with the unexpected downward chord change . " Now there was an introduction . Paul liked it , so we kept it . Then we were ready to go into the verse . " <p> A few years later , by the time they were making the Sgt. Pepper album together , the lessons were well learned . With all Martin 's drumming in of " starting with a hook , " Lennon by now instinctively knew how to begin a piece like " Strawberry Fields " with , " Let me take you down , " as if telling a story , rather than a more obvious line from the body of the song . <p> Martin concedes that , after the Beatles dissolved in 1970 , none of them alone has yet to match what they achieved artistically as a group . Arguably , McCartney 's " Maybe I 'm Amazed " single and the " Band on the Run " album , all of which Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is Lennon 's " Imagine . " But the consistent inspiration was gone . <p> " Those four people together , " muses Martin , " became something much stronger than those four individuals . That 's true of their songwriting , their recording - everything . Together they were impregnable . <p> " There is no question that when they broke up , Paul missed John and John missed Paul , " Martin says . " I actually think Paul would like to write material today like he used to write . But there is no one alive now that can give him that spur ... Yet , do n't forget , as a twosome they wrote nearly 300 great songs . That 's more than Cole Porter or Irving Berlin or Jerome Kern ever did . That 's certainly more than enough for one lifetime .
