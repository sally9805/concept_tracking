The most important thing we earn is your trust . " That Prudential Securities advertising slogan rang a bit hollow last week after the company agreed to pay the largest penalty ever levied against a brokerage for defrauding small investors . Prudential said it would repay at least $330 million to customers across the U.S. who lost money on the company 's limited partnerships in the 1980s . The firm will pay another $41 million in fines . Even those hefty sums might be little more than a down payment : in settling with the Securities and Exchange Commission , Prudential said it will fully compensate all investors who can show they were bilked in some $8 billion worth of partnership deals dating back to 1980 . Moreover , the company is all but handing over its checkbook to Irving Pollack , 75 , a Washington attorney and former SEC commissioner , who will determine the size of each award , if Prudential 's offers prove unacceptable to investors . <P> The sweeping case was virtually unprecedented among SEC actions , which are typically narrower in scope . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct that stretched over a decade and said it was systematically bad , " noted Joel Seligman , a University of Michigan law professor . Concedes a Prudential spokesman : " We made some real mistakes in terms of how the partnerships were marketed and sold . " In all , some 400,000 individual investors lost money on the deals . <P> While Prudential neither admitted nor denied that it broke the law , its arrangement with the SEC commits it to a punishing regimen of repayment of losses that the agency says Prudential Bache foisted on its customers . ( Pru Bache is the old name for the securities unit of Prudential Insurance . ) The deals involved more than 700 partnerships ranging from energy exploration to commercial real estate , ventures that normally attract sophisticated , high- income investors . <P> Parceling out compensation to the victims will now cost the company some $20 million in administrative expenses over the next three years . Pollack will earn $20,000 a month for supervising a cadre of lawyers , accountants and financial appraisers hired at his discretion on the Pru 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you 're a widow for whom the purchase of a risky oil-and-gas partnership was inappropriate and you were told it was safe , you 're very likely to get compensation , " says Thomas Newkirk , an associate SEC enforcement director who worked on the case . " But this is not money from heaven ; people will have to prove their claims . " <P> The $330 million compensation fund will also cover any court cases that Prudential settles after July 1 , 1993 . That provision grandfathered in a $120 million award that the company two weeks ago agreed to pay in a class-action suit in New Orleans . Since the fund has no ceiling and no statute of limitations will apply , it is unlikely that $330 million will cover all claims . But if there is any money left , it will revert to the U.S. Treasury . The one silver lining for the chastened firm : Prudential can write off the compensation payments as a tax-deductible business expense and thereby leave other taxpayers to foot part of the bill .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
