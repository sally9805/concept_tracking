Earth lies at the perfect distance from a beautiful star . The Sun provides just enough heat so that water can exist here in any of its three states : solid , liquid , and as . In its liquid state , water is a universal solvent and is thought to have been critical to the origin of life . Would our planet , located at the same distance from a different-sized star , be as suitable a home for the origin and evolution of life ? What if , that is , our Sun were more massive than it actually is ? Mass is the fundamental measure of how much material something contains . It is not the same as weight . An object 's weight depends on how far it is from the center of Earth ( or any other astronomical body it sits on ) . The farther the object is from the center of Earth , the less it weighs . Mass , on the other hand , is intrinsic to an object  --  an object has the same mass whether it is sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 're going to assume our new Sun is fifty percent more massive than the real Sun . A star that contains 1-1/2 solar masses is not exceptionally massive . The highest-mass stars astronomers have observed possess somewhere between 60 and 120 solar masses , while the lowest have just under 1/10 solar mass . To understand our hypothetical Sun 's effect on Earth ( and the solar system , in general ) , we need to look at two factors : gravity and radiation . First , the Sun 's mass creates the gravity that controls the movements of the planets , asteroids , and comets . Second , the Sun emits energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation and high-speed particles that bombard Earth and provide the energy necessary for life to thrive here . Our new Sun has different amounts of both gravity and radiated energy . We 'll examine the effects of each , but so we understand the point we 're starting from , let 's check what the real Sun is like . Its most critical characteristic is its surface temperature  --  5800 kelvins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why yellow ? You probably know intuitively that the temperature of a hot object determines its color . For example , as a piece of metal in a fire heats up , it changes color from its room-temperature gray to red to orange to yellow to blue-white and eventually to white . Similarly , the hotter a star is , the whiter it appears ; the cooler it is , the redder it appears . But looks can be deceiving . Stars ( and the heated piece of metal ) actually give off all colors , as well as all other forms of electromagnetic radiation , including infrared , radio waves , ultraviolet radiation , X rays , and gamma rays . This is called the electromagnetic spectrum , of which the rainbow or visible spectrum represents a tiny piece . All this radiation travels as waves differing only in their wavelength or distance from one wave crest to the next . If objects emit a range of wavelengths , why does each hot object appear to have a certain color ? The answer is that hot objects do n't emit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peak in its electromagnetic spectrum  --  light is emitted more strongly at one color than at the others . More to the point for our story , different temperatures always correspond to different colors . As the temperature increases , the wavelength of the peak shifts towards shorter wavelengths , a relationship called Wien 's displacement law , after German physicist Wilhelm Wien , who discovered the principle in 1893 . Room-temperature objects have their radiation peak in the infrared . To our eyes , insensitive to infrared light , these cool objects just look their normal color ( from reflected light ) . Heating an object will make it first glow red hot since red has the longest visible wavelength . When an object is heated further its peak moves through the visible spectrum toward violet , since violet has the shortest wavelength . Heated beyond that , the peak is in the invisible ultraviolet . In the visible part of the spectrum , the object emits nearly equal amounts of energy at each color and so appears white . Our eyes are sensitive to only a small range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tiny part for the spectrum where the Sun shines most brightly  --  visible light . In fact , our eyes are most sensitive to yellow-green light , corresponding to the color of the Sun from its surface temperature of 5800 kelvins . Indirectly , however , we do see other colors emitted by the Sun . The blue of the sky is blue sunlight scattered by atoms and molecules in our atmosphere . The orange and red of a sunrise or sunset appear when all the other colors are filtered out by the extra layers of atmosphere the sunlight must pass through when the Sun is low in the sky . The fact that our eyes adapted to the brightest radiation emitted by the Sun is not a coincidence . The gases in our atmosphere absorb or reflect much of the electromagnetic radiation from the Sun , but virtually all of the visible light emitted by the Sun in our direction reaches Earth 's surface unscathed . On the other hand most of the ultraviolet radiation and all of the X rays and gamma rays from the Sun are blocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrared radiation , from the Sun , vital for keeping surface water liquid , is actually reflected back into space or absorbed by water vapor in our atmosphere . Happily , enough infrared radiation is trapped by the atmosphere to make the surface comfortably warm . So our eyes adapted to the peak in the Sun 's radiation in part because it is so bright , and in part because that bright light reaches the ground and reflects well off most objects . Visible light is therefore useful in providing our brains with information about distant objects . I the Sun 's brightness peak had been somewhere else in the spectrum or if the visible light from the Sun did n't get through our atmosphere to Earth 's surface , then the range of electromagnetic radiation we see would be different . BRIGHT AND BLUE Now for the new Sun . Our new Sun 's surface temperature is about 7000 kelvins . We would classify it as a type F star . It gives off five times as much energy per second as our present Sun and is 30 percent larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all types of radiation ( like our Sun ) , its higher surface temperature makes it appear more blue . A brighter , bluer Sun means more blue light to scatter off our atmosphere , and therefore a sky that 's even more vividly blue . That 's the first , and least obtrusive , consequence of our " what if " scenario . For the purposes or the scenario , we 'll place Earth at the same distance from this new Sun as from the old . Under these circumstances , the new Sun appears 30 percent larger in the sky . Not only is the Sun more impressive , so are the sunsets . The colorful displays are longer and more glorious . We can revel in an extended period of green twilight , followed by brighter glows of yellow , orange , and red . Our year is also noticeably shorter . The law of gravitation , in the form of Kepler 's third law , tells us that the period of our orbit around the more massive Sun ( our " new " year ) will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or 298 " old " days long . A 30-year-old person today , having lived the same length of time on Earth in orbit around the new Sun , would be 36-1/2 " new " years old . LIFE IN THE RADIATION ZONE The gravitational effects of our new Sun are not nearly as dramatic as the effects of its increased radiation . For example , this Sun 's light is five times more intense than that of our old Sun . That 's strong enough to destroy our present eyes . Nature has almost certainly evolved very different eye structures in order for them to function under the glare of the blue-white star . Perhaps the eyes on the creatures of our transformed Earth are more heavily lidded and covered with built-in natural sunglasses . Brighter light means that fish can live deeper in the ocean and still have enough light to see by . Photosynthesis can occur at greater depths . With a larger volume of water suitable for life , the oceans are more heavily populated , both by animals and by plants . For habitats on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolution , and distribution of life is the higher level of non-visible radiation life is subjected to . Ultraviolet light and the higher-energy X rays and gamma rays are thousands of times more intense . This bath of ionizing radiation overwhelms our atmosphere 's defenses . The new Earth 's ozone layer is of little help blocking the incoming energy . Deadly radiation penetrates to the surface and inflicts severe damage to unprotected biological tissue . ( Ionizing radiation has enough energy to separate the atoms in molecules , thus destroying the structure of living material . That 's why exposure to too much X-ray radiation causes cancer and other diseases . ) The presence of intense levels of ionizing radiation at Earth 's surface requires significant adaptations in life is to survive and flourish in this hostile environment . Is this an insurmountable problem ? Probably not , considering the range of adverse conditions under which life thrives on our real Earth  --  boiling geysers , deep-sea thermal vents , Arctic seas . Life is everywhere . So let 's say that early in the history of our " what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oceans developed thick , metal-impregnated skins that effectively screened out dangerous radiation . Carrying this adaptation onto the land , life evolved with protective metallic shells or skins . Being heavy , some of these armored creatures evolved stronger muscles . Others just moved slowly . Our speculation assumes that the new Sun could cause an environmental disaster . But there is another possibility . It 's entirely conceivable that the higher level of radiation has itself changed the atmospheric chemistry sufficiently for the atmosphere to set up new screens to protect the surface from the radiation . Perhaps under a massive Sun , Earth would not be so unlivable after all . Except for the heat . IT 'S SO HOT ... ! Allowing for the fact that not all the heat from the Sun striking our atmosphere reaches Earth 's surface , it turns out that the new surface temperature of Earth is typically 150deg Fahrenheit instead of the 75deg we normally enjoy today . Needless to say , polar ice caps do not exist . The additional water has raised the shoreline , decreasing the habitable surface area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America is under water and most of Earth 's vegetation has adapted to tropical conditions . The heat also causes more evaporation of water into the atmosphere , resulting in a higher humidity worldwide . The humidity is so high that the planet has more for less continual rain . Under these conditions , heat becomes trapped between the surface and clouds , sending the temperature even higher . Where could we , for our metal-shielded equivalents , comfortably live on this altered world ? The fundamental issue is one of thermodynamics . Our internal temperature is 98.6deg Fahrenheit , typical of warm-blooded animals . On our normal world , internal temperatures much above that eventually lead to death , and in hot climates it 's important for all creatures to find ways to cool off . Our primary cooling mechanism is sweating  --  water in our bodies carries heat to our skin where it radiates away when the water evaporates . If the air temperature is high enough , however , heat begins flowing in through our skin instead or out . At internal temperatures above 102degF , brain damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new Earth , we 'll assume animals have the same internal biology as we know today . If that is the case , the tropics are so hot at 150degF as to be uninhabitable by us and most other creatures that we are familiar with . The areas we call temperate zones are only marginally tolerable to life . With a 1-1/2-solar mass Sun in the sky , Antarctica , northern Siberia , and northern Canada are now the most comfortable places to live . Although there is seasonal ice in Antarctica , in general the areas we previously considered to be frozen wastelands are now temperate and are the most desirable habitats in our new world for warm-blooded creatures . Separated by an uncrossable zone at the tropics , the polar regions evolve into two unique regions , each with their own indigenous life forms that never meet . Or would they ? Let 's go one step farther . Let 's call upon nature 's marvelous ability to find adaptations for extreme climates . In this scenario , animals evolve to fill the niches in the hotter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high enough that even at 150degF it is cooler outside their bodies than inside . Or if there are biological restrictions that keep internal temperatures below this level , then our hypothetical creatures might possess more efficient , built-in air conditioners than we and most other animals have . Perhaps the " what if " animals have large reservoirs of water they use to carry heat out , or they evolved with a biologically generated , freonlike refrigeration system similar to that used in mechanical cooling systems today . How long it would take refrigerated creatures to evolve is anyone 's guess . Evolution under a massive star might proceed at the same pace as on the real Earth , for the intense radiation could produce more genetic mutations , accelerating evolution . On the other hand , considering the special adaptations needed for survival on a hot Earth , sentient life could take millions of years longer to evolve than on our temperate Earth . MAKING THE MOVE When considering whether life could exist around a 1-1/2-solar mass star , an obvious solution to the overdose of heat and radiation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Sun . At a distance between the present orbits of Mars and Jupiter , we would encounter essentially the same amount of heat from the massive Sun as we receive here on Earth today . In other words , the present asteroid belt would be the center of the new Sun 's life zone , the distance from a star where water can coexist in its three states . But as inviting as it sounds to live farther away , there is a catch , one that concerns the evolution of this star . Stars and planetary systems begin their lives as clouds of gas and dust that collapse or condense because or their own gravity . Newly formed stars begin giving off energy that is created in their centers or cores . This energy , created by the fusion of smaller atoms into larger ones , comes to the stars ' surfaces and then flies into space as the radiation we encountered earlier . It takes about a million years for the energy created in the core of our real Sun to reach its surface . Sunlight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's surface , was actually created a million years ago in its core . But the energy-producing fusion process at the core will last only so long . Eventually the core 's hydrogen fuel becomes converted into helium . Fusion stops . Lacking the outward pressure created by fusion and succumbing to the inward pressure of the mass of the star , the core begins to contract . As the core contracts , the Sun 's internal temperature goes up . This triggers previously unburned hydrogen in a shell around the collapsing core to fuse into helium . The energy created in this shell pushes the outer layers farther out than they are now . In the case of our real Sun , its outer layer will expand outward and come to rest close to Venus ' present orbit . The Sun will turn into a red giant and Earth will be fried to a crisp . Do n't unload your real estate , though . This wo n't happen for another 5 billion years . The helium cores in the Sun and in more massive stars compress until the pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At this point , the core stops contracting . After their cores are converted to carbon , virtually every star with one solar mass or more ends its life cycle by ridding itself of material , either through a single massive explosion ( for stars bigger than eight solar masses ) or through a series of gentler pulses that blow of the outer layers of the star . Astronomers estimate that 5 to 8 billion years from now ( roughly 10 to 13 billion years after it first formed ) our Sun will shed its outer layers , forming a shell of expanding gases around it called a planetary nebula . The naked central core of the Sun will remain  --  a white dwarf star at the heart of the nebula . Our new Sun , though more massive , has a similar fate . It , too , will blow off its outer layers , creating an expanding planetary nebula . The difference is that our high-mass Sun has a lifetime of only 3 billion years . life our speculative solar system had started out 4.6 billion years ago ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what if " Sun would have ballooned into a red giant and formed a planetary nebula a billion and a half years ago . Nothing more advanced than microorganisms would have existed when the larger Sun died . Just how massive a star could we orbit and still be here , five billion years after the solar system formed ! Any star with more than 1-1/4 solar masses will end its life before it is five billion years old . In other words , our Sun is about as massive as a star can be and still last long enough for sentient lie to develop on planets around it , assuming that biological evolution normally takes several billion years . This assumption is by no means certain . For example , geologists have strong evidence from certain layers of the planet 's crust that throughout history Earth has been struck by errant asteroids . These impacts could well have been powerful enough to destroy nascent life forms which , if their destruction had n't occurred , could have evolved into advanced life forms earlier in Earth 's history . Indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would lie have been different ? Or what if the Sun had been a less-massive star ? Or Earth had been closer to the Sun ? The " what if " game leads to many possible worlds , some of them lifeless , many of them alien , but all of them fascinating . Neil F. Comins is a professor of physics at the University of Maine in Orono . His last story in this series was " Seeing the World Through Infrared Eyes , " June 1991 . <p>                     @x IN 1985 , THE SMALL NUMBER OF BOOKS PUBLISHED THAT YEAR BY AFRICAN AMERICAN AUTHORS AND ARTISTS ASTOUNDED GINNY MOORE KRUSE , THEN DIRECTOR OF THE COOPERATIVE CHILDREN 'S BOOK CENTER ( CCBC ) . AS A MEMBER OF THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION 'S CORETTA SCOW KING AWARD COMMITTEE , KRUSE RECEIVED ALL ELIGIBLE BOOKS ( I.E. CHILDREN 'S BOOKS WRITTEN AND/OR ILLUSTRATED BY AFRICAN AMERICANS ) , SO SHE KNEW THERE WERE JUST 18 SUCH BOOKS OUT OF ABOUT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Furthermore , of those eighteen books , only twelve had any African American cultural content . The other six were books such as Bicycle Race ( Harpercollins , 1985 ) by African American artist Donald Crews , known for his wordless picture books about different kinds of transportation . <p> L : IT BEGAN WITH A DECISION The CCBC made the decision that year to document the number of books published by African Americans by citing the results in the introduction of our annual publication , CCBC Choices . We documented the number again the following year when , coincidentally , there were also just eighteen books published . We continued to publish the number every year and saw the count nearly double between 1985 and 1987 , and then more than double four years later . <p> Then we began to hear from people in the field . Librarians and teachers called to ask for book titles and the names of authors represented in the statistics . Academics called to find out if we had additional statistics on multicultural publishing in general . Children 's book publishers called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works . USA Today called us for permission to use the statistics for a feature article they were running on the appalling state of multicultural publishing in 1989 . <p> L : PIONEERS OF THE CAUSE One of the most interesting contacts made during that time was with Wade Hudson and his wife Cheryl Willis Hudson , who were launching a small press called Just Us Books to publish Black-interest books . They contacted us for statistics , which helped to emphasize the importance of their publishing endeavor . The numbers reflected for the world at large , something that African American teachers , librarians , and parents had known for generations : there were simply not enough books out there to meet the demand . <p> Just Us Books became part of a movement of small , independent presses , mostly owned and operated by people or color , devoted exclusively to publishing authentic multicultural books for children . At that time , Children 's Book Press , a small company in San Francisco , was the only publisher in the United States that regularly published bilingual books reflecting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Low was also established later in 1991 , to publish picture books by and about people of color . Part of their stated mission is to find and nurture previously unpublished authors and illustrators of color . <p> Meanwhile , traditional corporate publishing houses increased their commitment to multicultural publishing in general . As the population of the United States grew and became increasingly more diverse , we also noticed an increase in the number of books published . In 1995 , one hundred books by African American authors were published and the numbers have continued to ebb and flow , averaging about 85 books per year . <p> L : THE NUMBERS SPEAK VOLUMES Once we started publicizing the statistics for African American literature , we received requests for similar statistics for other authors of color . Fortunately , the CCBC receives almost all trade books published for children and teens each year , and we also make an effort to collect books from small presses . As new books come in by and about people of color , we add the titles to a log we maintain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published in CCBC Choices . We also make the statistics available on our website at : http : **47;12781;TOOLONG . <p> What have we learned from keeping these statistics over time ? First , we have been able to observe that while the numbers have increased since the mid-1980s , at a certain point , they reached a plateau , so the percentage of children 's books written or illustrated by people of color never surpasses 5% of the total number of children 's books published . Second , because we keep track of statistics that reflect books both by and about people of color , we observe those numbers are often radically different , showing that books about African Americans , for example , are often written by people who are not African American themselves . This seems to be especially true in the case of children 's books about Native Americans -- they are rarely written by Native peoples themselves . <p> More important perhaps , is what can not be learned from the statistics alone . The statistics say nothing about the quality of the books we count . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They do not tell us if the books are folktales or historical fiction about war ( as the vast majority of Asian and Asian American books were until recently ) , or if they are lighthearted humorous stories or hard-hitting contemporary social realism . In addition , they do not tell us , for example , that in a year when six books had Native American authors , four of those books were written by the same author , Joseph Bruchac . <p> L : WHERE ARE WE GOING ? While there seems to be a heightened awareness in the publishing world about the importance of multicultural literature for children and teens in our increasingly diverse society , we still have far to go . It will be a sign of great progress , for example , when the percentage of books by authors and illustrators of color comes closer to the overall percentage of people of color in our general population . We need to see a renewed effort in finding new authors and artists of color , and in encouraging and nurturing their talents . And , most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multicultural literature by buying the books that do get published . As author Alexis DeVeaux once said : " Buying a book is a political act .
