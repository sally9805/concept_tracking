Here in Minnesota , we are carrying on an experiment in democracy , having elected a Governor whom we can especially enjoy because only 37% voted for him and the rest of us are not responsible . This is something new in America , the ironic public servant . <P> Ordinarily a Governor is elected with 51% or 55% or ( if he is young and has luminous children and his opponent is a pencil-necked geek ) 60% of the vote , and two months after his Inauguration , he starts to brown around the edges and disillusionment sets in , starting with the people who once worshiped the ground he trod on and now see that , alas , he is a dumb cluck like everyone else and has no solutions for problems such as ignorance and cruelty and the aging process . <P> In Minnesota , our Emperor started out with no clothes at all . He came to us from a branch of the performing arts in which large men who resemble comic-book characters pretend to fight each other , so when he was inaugurated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but donned a suit and white shirt and horn-rimmed glasses and managed to sound half-smart about a third of the time , his approval ratings turned three sheets to the wind and have stayed that way ever since . <P> His success has been discouraging to people in politics , much as the success of The Blair Witch Project is discouraging to filmmakers : if the public embraces something so shallow and tedious , what future is there for the professionals ? But the source of the man 's strength is no secret . It is that he speaks plain English with none of the circuitous posturing and preening of public officials , who can not give you the time of day without saying that time is a topic of great concern to them , as it is to all Americans , and that they have long devoted themselves to finding a solution for the chronic problem of time shortage . Governor Ventura just says it 's 12 o'clock . <P> People are grateful for that , and surprised , and on the basis of this plain-spokenness , Ventura has leaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the religious right and the war on drugs , which nobody else dares to do . He is hard as nails on the subject of campaign financing . He is brave in so many ways , and just when you want to admire him , he shows his great capacity for silliness , and there is nothing more fatal in politics . I 'm sorry , but it simply is true . Voters do n't elect people to goof around . <P> This summer , after he told farmers he does n't like to use the term farm crisis because it is too negative , Ventura , for a million dollars or so , climbed back into the pro-wrestling ring as a referee , to be among men strutting around the ring pointing at their butts and yelling butt-related words for the audience to yell back at them . It was n't a proud moment for Minnesotans , especially if you made the mistake of watching . Then , in September , Ventura touted Donald Trump as a presidential candidate . Let 's be clear about this : anyone who imagines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stale bagel . Donald Trump makes Ross Perot look like a giant . Jesse Ventura was the first man , aside from the men in Mr. Trump 's employ , ever to make this imaginative leap .
