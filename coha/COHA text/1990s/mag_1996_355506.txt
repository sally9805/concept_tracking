The experts say Eldrick ( " Tiger " ) Woods strikes a golf ball so hard that the sound it makes in flight is unique  --  a kind of whining swoosh , occasionally accompanied by the crack of a club head caving in . The balls that emit this signature sound routinely travel farther than those of any other tournament player . <P> Certainly the swooshing sound made last week when Woods , 20 , a junior at Stanford , decided to join the pros was unlike that made by any other young player joining the tour . That sound was money , most of it from the Nike Corp. , fluttering down on the young phenom , who is suddenly the richest golfer never to have won a professional tournament  --  in addition to being one of the very best players ever to enter the game . <P> He also happens to have dark skin and an incandescent personality . The prospect of his success in a nearly all-white sport gives him a marketing potential as remarkable as his distance off the tee . Thus Nike and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $43 million during the next five years for product endorsements . While other golfers like Arnold Palmer , Jack Nicklaus and Greg Norman have parlayed their championship standings into huge fortunes made off the course , Woods has the potential to take that money-spinning skill to a new level . Even though golf lacks the mass popularity of basketball , Woods could be Michael Jordanesque in the world of sports marketing . <P> To be Jordanesque , however , a player in any sport has to be like Mike : the best ever . Woods just may be . By the time he turned pro last week , he had set a ton of records in amateur golf . Two weekends ago he won his third straight U.S. amateur title , a feat never before accomplished , and he did it dramatically . The final was a 36-hole , match-play affair  --  meaning the golfers played to win each hole against a single opponent rather than accumulate the lowest score for the total field . As he began the last 18 holes , Woods was down five holes to his even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of Florida . With three holes remaining , he was still two down . He birdied 16 and 17 to square the match and then beat Scott on the second extra hole . Victory in golf is often the result of an opponent 's failure . In the amateur , however , it was Woods ' own stone-cold determination and excellence that produced the unprecedented victory . <P> This third U.S. amateur title was the culmination of a youthful career like no other in the history of golf . At age three , Woods was beating 10-year-olds . In the second grade he won an international match against other kids . At 11 he was undefeated in 30 Southern California youth events . At 16 he became the youngest person ever to play in a Professional Golf Association tournament ( as an amateur , of course ) . He won three United States Golf Association junior titles , the first when he was 15 . By last week there was nothing more for him to do in amateur golf .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
