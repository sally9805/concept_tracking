<p> " " OH , so you 're in a big death state , " said actress Susan Sarandon , a little laugh filtering through the phone line . <p> Now there 's a way to start a conversation . <p> Sarandon was referring to Texas ' nation-leading execution statistics . Since the death penalty was restored in the United States in 1976 , Texas has carried out three times as many executions as any other state , putting to death 104 prisoners - one third of the nation 's 314 total . <p> Sarandon has learned quite a bit about the death penalty , thanks to her role in " Dead Man Walking , " which opens Friday in Houston . In the film , directed and written by her partner , Tim Robbins , Sarandon gives a powerful performance as Sister Helen Prejean , a Louisiana nun who finds herself in the uncomfortable position of spiritual adviser to a death-row inmate . <p> Based on Prejean 's best-selling book , the film also stars Sean Penn as Matthew Poncelet , a cold , hateful , racist killer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both actors give jolting performances and have been prominently mentioned in Oscar forecasts . ( The film , which opened in December in Los Angeles , is eligible for the 1995 Academy Awards . ) <p> In real life , Sarandon and Robbins are considered liberals . <p> Both have been active in such political causes as women 's rights and the fight against AIDS . So a strong statement against the death penalty in their film would hardly be a surprise . <p> And perhaps the film is an argument against executions . A scene in which a man dies slowly from a lethal injection is hard to watch . <p> Yet the movie portrays Poncelet as a terrible person . It shows the grief of the teen-agers ' parents . It continually returns to grim scenes in which Poncelet and a partner terrorize and kill the young couple . <p> In creating Poncelet from two death-row inmates ( Patrick Sonnier and Robert Willy ) whom the real Prejean knew , Robbins was careful not to glamorize Penn 's character . <p> " " I wanted to show him for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A real mean person , and almost unredeemable . " Sarandon realized that some people would judge the film by how they view her and Robbins . <p> " " A lot of people have a predisposition to expect certain things , " she said . " " There are people who wo n't go to see it because they assume they know what it is . But the more interesting people are more open and take the film for what it is . <p> " " We 've gotten a couple of reviews that have called it a pro-death-penalty movie and a couple that have called it a Christian movie . " <p> Her own feelings about the death penalty went from general to specific during the shoot . <p> " " I 've always thought intellectually that it did n't make sense , " she said . " " It 's expensive ; it 's arbitrary and capricious ; it 's not a deterrent . It 's a great sound bite to get elected on . <p> " " In dealing with this , I 've clarified my position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a totally human and primal emotion , I do n't feel I want to legislate it . <p> " " As a mother raising kids in a world in which violence is escalating , it 's really important to examine not who is to die but who deserves to kill and what it means to recognize the humanity in everyone . I feel more clearly now there is no reason to kill . " <p> But telling the audience what to think is propaganda , she said . <p> " " Good filmmaking allows the audience to go home with a new perspective and make up their mind . It was never our intent to do anything but show the complexity of a lot of different issues . <p> " " The film puts you in the shoes of so many people that you would never allow yourself to identify with . It makes you earn your position , whatever it is . " <p> Sarandon , who met Prejean while filming " The Client , " was impressed and read the nun 's book . <p> In the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorts of emotional torments : her fear of visiting death row and dealing with its frightening residents , the discouraging views of her fellow church people , her decision to do what she sees as her duty and the anguish of being another source of pain for the victims ' families . <p> " " I tend to work in a very irreverent fashion , " Sarandon said . <p> " " I like to fool around and play . When you are playing a person who exists and is often on the set , that makes me pretty self-conscious . <p> " " On the other hand , when you have access to all the particulars of a truth , you find so many interesting details . <p> It was my job to keep scraping the surface to find little things we could put into the film . There is a wealth of detail that helps you be specific , which is all acting is about , being as specific as possible . " <p> Sarandon tried something new , an approach she got from Prejean 's way of dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role was just to be there for the pain of the parents , to absorb their sorrow , to be there for ( the inmate ) , " Sarandon said . <p> " " So I tried to empty myself and be a vessel to serve , not only the movie , but Sean or Poncelet , and trust that in the end that would pay off . Which is not a very actor-y thing to do when someone else not only has the flashier part , but the flashier hairdo . " <p> Sarandon and Robbins met on the set of " Bull Durham , " in which she played a baseball groupie , he a hot pitcher . In real life , Sarandon , now 49 , and Robbins , 37 , moved in together and began a family . She had a daughter , Eva Maria , from an earlier relationship with director Franco Amurri ( " Monkey Trouble " ) , and now has two sons with Robbins , Jack Henry and Miles . <p> Sarandon , who had a cameo in Robbins ' political satire " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantages of working and living with the same person . <p> " " Even if I did n't work with him , he 's awfully bright . Our sense of what works is very much aligned . I trust him artistically . I admire him as a writer and director , so I felt I was in really good hands , " she said . <p> " " The disadvantage , of course , is that when you 're having a really bad day , you just ca n't stand that person . It may have nothing to do with the project . We had five or six really horrible days where I hated him or he hated me . <p> " " We 're still talking to each other , and I think we 're in a better place . We never blew up publicly . We managed to hold it until we got somewhere private . " <p> Penn , who has just about given up acting for directing , said he was drawn back in front of the cameras because of his respect for Robbins . Penn finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that portraying this tormented soul was excruciating . Fortunately , Sarandon said , those feelings were appropriate for the role of Poncelet , and he used them . She praised Penn as a bright , funny and generous actor . <p> " " He 's very there in the moment , " she said . " " I trusted him and he trusted me , so that sometimes I 'd lead and sometimes he 'd lead , and we 'd both be surprised where we ended up . As an actor you ca n't pay to have that experience . I would work with him again in a flash . " <p> The nature of the film made for strange shooting . The two main characters , whose relationship becomes sort of an odd , spiritual love story , are always separated by bars . <p> " " There were always physical limitations , " she said , " " and few props . They could seldom even be in the same frame with each other . <p> " " I found what happened , which was unexpected , was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimacy just grew , and of a nature I have n't experienced , especially in a film where you ca n't even touch the other person . " Sarandon 's activism , independent lifestyle , late-in-life parenthood and unusual movie roles ( especially in " Thelma &; Louise " ) have made her a popular feminist personality , though she prefers the word " " humanist . " <p> " " I do n't see people in the supermarket vegetable section moving out of my way and dropping to their knees , " she said . <p> " " Occasionally someone will say , ' You had your children really late , and that really inspired me . ' " " I think of all the mistakes I made . If I had n't learned something by now , I 'd be dead . At almost 50 , I 'm going into the best years of my life . If it means for other people they can , too , that 's great . But I do n't think about it . " <p> TYPE : Movie Review
