One day after he pulled off the biggest win of his presidency with a 234-200 vote in the House for the North American Free Trade Agreement , Bill Clinton was already lining up allies for future battles . As Air Force One carried him to Seattle for a meeting with 13 Asian and Pacific leaders , he called Lane Kirkland of the AFL-CIO to say their bitter differences on the trade pact should not prevent them from joining forces on health-care reform and worker- retraining plans . He called Dan Rostenkowski and urged the House Ways and Means Committee chairman to push the languishing jobless-benefits bill . From the White House , Hillary Clinton joined in , telephoning Tom Donahue , Kirkland 's secretary-treasurer , to make amends . " The President , " said one aide , " is into healing . " <P> The come-from-behind win on NAFTA , Clinton 's advisers insist , will help prove to voters that the President has the mettle to withstand even tougher fights that loom next year . And they add that the promise of a free-trade zone from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to force trade concessions from Japan and other Asian nations as well as press for a successful completion of the current round of talks on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade by Dec. 15 . " A good GATT agreement could create 1.4 million American jobs and boost the average American family income by $1,700 a year , " Clinton said in Seattle on Friday . " This , my fellow Americans , is the answer to 20 years of stagnant wages for the hardworking middle class . " <P> Until the NAFTA vote last week , Clinton was a New Democrat in name only . Though his rhetoric often sounded centrist , he had saved most of his energy to keep promises that fit neatly into the tax-and-spend rhythm of the old Democratic Party . But in NAFTA Clinton embraced a treaty fashioned by Republicans , ignored the advice of many around him and defeated a majority in his own party . This time Clinton earned his New Democrat stripes . " Some fights are definitional , " said House minority whip Newt Gingrich , whose party provided most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " <P> The next challenge for Clinton will be to construct similar centrist coalitions to pass health-care reform , welfare reform and other contentious initiatives . The NAFTA group " is not really a coalition at all , " said a White House official . " It just proves that anytime you get the business community behind something , you get a lot of Republicans . And anytime you get the President , you get a third of the Democratic Party . " Indeed , days after the NAFTA vote , a similar group of moderate Democrats and Republicans was poised to approve $90 billion in budget cuts sponsored by John Kasich of Ohio and Tim Penny of Minnesota over Clinton 's objections . And a senior Administration official told TIME last week that deteriorating support in Congress for health-care reform may require Clinton to postpone welfare reform until much later next year .
