Now it appears that Louis Sullivan ca n't make his subordinates listen to him either . Angered by his treatment at the San Francisco AIDS conference  --  his speech was drowned out by ACT UP hecklers and he was pelted with condoms  --  he returned to Washington and issued an angry order that contacts with ACT UP should be limited to those that are " necessary and productive .

George Bush called Fauci a hero during a presidential debate and has twice asked him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
