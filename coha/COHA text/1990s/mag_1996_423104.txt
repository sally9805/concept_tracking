Remember the story about conflicting definitions of an elephant , each by someone describing a different part ? Those are the varied reports about the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women ( September 4-15 ) and the overlapping NGO ( nongovernmental organizations ) Forum on Women ' 95 ( August 30-September 8 ) But most would agree that the Platform for Action emerging from the conference is remarkable  --  a document that even with its flaws is the strongest official statement on women internationally to date . This triumph was at least 20 years in the making . Momentum built during the 1976-85 U.N . Decade for Women ( the Mexico City , Copenhagen , and Nairobi women 's conferences ) , and women declined to disperse obediently at the decade 's end ; instead , we intensified both grassroots organizing efforts and NGO pressure on governments . Furthermore , women broke out of the ghetto and mobilized regarding the U.N . general conferences : the Conference on Environment and Development ( Rio de Janeiro , 1992 ) , the World Conference on Human Rights ( Vienna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Development ( Cairo , 1994 ) , and the World Summit for Social Development ( Copenhagen , 1995 ) all witnessed the growing presence  --  and clout  --  of women . At each of these conferences , a daily Women 's Caucus , organized for NGOs by the Women 's Environment and Development Organization ( WIEDO ) , directed and focused on-site sophisticated lobbying efforts so that government delegations were forced to realize that all issues are " women 's issues . " Meanwhile , women were painstakingly learning the complex ways of the U.N. , and how to make an impact on its policies . Groups went through the process of application for accredited NGO status ; activists dragged themselves to the numerous regional preparatory meetings that precede each conference , where the real work of affecting content and agendas takes place and from which the draft document emerges . They learned that by the time that draft actually gets to the conference for which it 's intended , it 's not likely to be substantively changed , and that the time for lobbying governments with new input is by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inclusion of NGO representatives on government delegations . It was the most organized international effort to date , and the payoff came in terms of the I conference document  --  about I which , more later . But first , the forum , since it began first . This report is a mix of facts , analysis , and the generously shared thoughts of old and new friends from around the globe . You probably should n't feed it peanuts . The Forum : Spins , Security , Sisterhood The good news : 30,000 women " rose above it . " The bad news : we had to . The plain truth : men would never have tolerated such treatment . Women did  --  not necessarily something to be proud of . A spin has emerged in forum postmortems that  --  whether based in defensive pride at having survived miserable conditions , or in dread of seeming to carp  --  accentuates the positive to a ludicrously inaccurate degree . It claims that only feminists from northern countries complained about the forum planners or Chinese-government attempts to control thousands of grassroots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : African women charging their Chinese hosts with racist attitudes ; South Asian women protesting visa delays/denials ; Latin Americans complaining of arbitrary detentions ; Middle Easterners appalled at some of the overcrowded , even unsanitary , Huairou living accommodations ; Pacific Island women infuriated at the Chinese press for censoring their hottest issue , French nuclear testing ( China also conducts nuclear tests , remember ) . Frankly , it 's an act of disrespect to Chinese women  --  all the non-hand-picked , non Stepford-feminist ones we never got to meet-to pretend , as did Forum Executive Director Irene Santiago , Forum Convener Khunying Supatra Masdit , and Gertrude Mongella , Secretary General ( SG ) of the U.N . Conference , that the Chinese government was the dandiest host conceivable and that China 's just a developing nation that did its best , geewhiz . China ' salsoa 4 world power , by golly-and judging from all the semipornographic billboards promulgating multinational corporate products-its government lusts after the worst the West offers while fearing the best , such as even a pretense of free speech . When Kenya ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hosted the 1985 Women 's Conference and Forum , the Kenyan government , unlike the Chinese , did n't issue 11 warnings to its citizens to be wary of these foreign radicals who might run around naked and be HIV/AIDS positive . See , the Beijing Boys really wanted the Olympics in the year 2000 . Losing out because of their human rights record made them cranky , so the U.N . awarded a consolation prize : us . But hordes of political women instead of teams of apolitical athletes were maybe less their compensatory ideal than their worst nightmare . Wistfully pretending that gold medalists , not feminists , were advancing on the Forbidden City , they based the U.N . Conference next to Beijing 's Asian Games Village and staged epic ceremonies , with torch-passing at the National Olympic Sports Center Stadium , fashion shows ( huh ) , martial arts teams , and battalions of heavily lipsticked children costumed as matadors ( huh ? ) , dancing or releasing thousands of stoned doves dizzy from being repeatedly caught and released for such spectacles . ( The acrobats were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although there are just so many times you can appreciate Beethoven 's " Ode to Joy " in one three-day period . ) Red carpets ( literally ) and interpreters who actually spoke languages other than Mandarin were reserved for the conference . Uneasy with the nongovernmental concept , the Chinese government exiled the forum from its planned Beijing site to " scenic " Huairou , more than 90 minutes ( in rain , more than two hours ) away . NGOs threatened to boycott . But forum officials Santiago and Supatra  --  holding themselves more accountable to their diplomatic careers than to their grassroots constituency-reassured NGOs of government guarantees : excellent lodging and communications facilities would be built for those staying in Huairou , and buses would shuttle every 20 minutes between Huairou and Beijing . Fits of mirth . Specially constructed buildings lacked walls and roofs . Only toward the forum 's end , after women got blessedly " shrill , " did buses appear every half hour  --  sort of . " Volunteer Guides " were politely unfamiliar with Huairou and with any non Chinese language . Maps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ( 2 ) lacking entire buildings , which made finding anyone or anything a bracing challenge , especially since workshop venues were changed with no notice and the Official Schedule listing the almost 5,000 work shops lacked an index . Honest . Tent area " paths " - thin concrete squares laid without fixative on bare earth  --  turned graham-crackery with rain and sank in the surrounding mud . Draconian " security " measures were not exaggerated by the Western press : uniformed and plainclothes police , body frisks , room searches , confiscation of literature/videos/ signs ; " appointed " hotels and " designated " restaurants ( quality control or female control ) ; even a " regulated " protest area : a Playground . Why did women endure such treatment For each other 's sake . ( This is how they get us . ) Here 's another montage : A virtual city of female people . Turbans , caftans , saris , sarongs , kente cloth , blue jeans . Workshops-on microcredit , caste , women 's studies , " comfort " women , solar stoves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultural events . A " once and future pavilion " demystifying men 's technology and celebrating women 's alternative technologies . First timers , euphoric at the sheer numbers , finally feeling part of a vast global movement . Veterans delighted that " cultural defense " justifications finally wilted under a unifying assault against purdah , sexual slavery , polygyny . Special honors go to a triad that emerged in spontaneous leadership : ( 1 ) Disability NGOs , outraged at crumbly paths , workshop assignments to second-floor , no-elevator venues , and too-steep ramps - " for ski-jumping , not chairs , " quipped one Filipina feminist on wheels ; they daringly staged the first demonstration outside the " designated protest area , " an energetic roll-in. ( 2 ) The U.S. Women of Color coalition-a de facto microcosm of the world 's women , but with a shared language , and experience in alliance-building-who found themselves ascendant as coalition facilitators . And ( 3 ) lesbian activists , who exuberantly staged the first march ( far from the designated play ground , kiddo ) , chanting " Liberte , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakout demos-a daily defiance teaching the Chinese police how to study their shoe-tips intently . Major attention to the rights of girl children was unfortunately matched by only token support for the visibility of old women 's rights . But more than 1,000 women united for the Women in Black vigil on violence against women , organized by Asia-Pacific groups . ( How I somehow wound up making and carrying the sign reading " Do n't Forget the Women of Tienanmen Square " - and my experience afterward-is another story . I 'd been trying to be good . But authoritarian regimes bring out the 1960s in me . ) The Conference : Out Of the Holy Brackets And into the Policy Mainstream Meanwhile , back in Beijing , the conference began , with its own security incursions ( mostly against journalists , though Winnie Mandela gave as good as she got in one scuffle ) . But on this supposedly inviolate temporary U.N . " territory , " the U.N . insisted that the Chinese police withdraw . The conference also suffered from a minor epidemic of " first ladies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. right wing by going to China and speaking substantively both in Beijing and Huairou . But more than one delegate ( names tactfully withheld ) conveyed discomfort that the drive toward women holding power directly was subtly undermined by the presence of at least 16 first ladies . Of the ( fewer ) female heads of state or government , Pakistan 's , Prime Minister Benazir its Bhutto delivered the most virtuoso speech . In this juggling act , she deftly ( 1 ) decried fundamentalism , while defending Islam from accusations of misogyny ; ( 2 ) affirmed the " traditional family as the bedrock of the society , " while attacking female infanticide as the cause of the current sex imbalance in more than 1S Asian countries ; and ( 3 ) defended cultural values , while announcing that Pakistan of would become a signatory to CEDAW ( the U.N . Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women ) . And her visual subtext Bhutto 's usual elegantly draped head scarf-her chic gesture to the hijab-was unsecured over her sleek hair , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each nod of her head . This double message to the mullahs back home magnetized every gaze present . Riveting suspense : would she catch it before it slid off completely At the last possible moment , with the barest riddle of a smile , she 'd resettle her chiffon banner-only to have it promptly begin its slippage again . The best " position paper " was the single page signed by Marye Kat and Meike Keldenich ( ages 12 and 11 ) , members of the Netherlands delegation : " Most of you promised to include youth in delegations .... Now , as far as we know . we are again the only ones . It you do n't do what you have promised , how can we believe you will do what you are promising now at this conference ? ... When you arc included in the delegation you are able to talk to important persons , which is difficult when you are only allowed to go to the NGO Forum . " These girls have a political future . So does the Netherlands . The general terminology reflected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feminists have entered the policy mainstream . I can remember being criticized for using " oppression , " " liberation " and " power "  --  as opposed to the less threatening a " discrimination " and " equality " ; Bhutto 's speech included all five of those words . I remember buttons reading " All Women Are Working Women " ( for a 1970s welfare rights demonstration ) , and how we had to explain that shocking concept . Now , there it was , in bold letters , on the front of the U.N . International Labour Office press packet . Which brings us to the Platform for Action itself . The draft document was strong ; activist NGO women had helped write it , remember , at five regional prep-cons . But the fundamentalist Christian Islamist-Vatican coalition , availing itself of U.N . procedure , imposed brackets around text it deemed controversial , so the draft went to Beijing with a substantial third of it caged in so-called Holy Brackets . The first brackets melted away through negotiated compromise language in closed-session trade-offs between delegates . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , working in tandem through allnight sessions : the European Union ; the Scandinavian at countries ( decried in fundamentalist leaflets as the " Satann , Nordic Group " ) ; and especially the Group of 77 , the major coalition from to the South , skillfully chaired by the Philippines ' Senator Leticia Shahani . So 189 countries adopted the final Platform for Action and its shorter preamble , the Beijing in Declaration , by consensus . There 's too much abstract he language , yes ; too little on rely , source allocation , institutional reform , implementation  --  although more than 90 governments committed to specific action . There are few time lines  --  although paragraph 297 specifies that by the end of 1996 , governments in consultation with NGOs should have developed implementation strategies for their countries , with time-bound targets . The wording is bland on many points , including the right to inheritance . And we failed to retain the phrases " sexual orientation " and " sexual rights . " Still . We consolidated , even broadened , gains won previously . Paragraph 96 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have control over and decide freely and responsibly on matters related to their sexuality , including sexual and reproductive health , free of coercion , discrimination , and violence . " Many countries pledged voluntarily to interpret lesbian rights as covered under paragraph 46 , which recognizes that women face additional barriers to full equality , such as race , age , ethnicity , religion , culture , disability , because they are indigenous , or " because of other status . " Not good enough . But a great stagger forward . The document also criticizes structural adjustment programs ; advises cuts in military spending in favor of social spending ; urges women 's participation at all peace talks and in all decision-making affecting development and environment ; confronts violence against women ; calls for measuring women 's unpaid work ; and refers to " the family in its various forms . " And it recommends new U.N . post  --  an adviser on " women 's issues " in the Secretary-General 's office but women worldwide are already after the job of SG itself . Bringing It All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world 's women , " says our own former congresswoman Bella Abzug , a major voice at both the forum and conference . So write the U.N . Department of Public Information for a copy and read it . Study how its content and resources can be used to meet women 's needs in your area , Kansas or Kathmandu . Investigate your city/state/ province/federal government 's plans for implementation ( U.S. women should know that the Clinton administration announced eight specific steps ; see sidebar on page 17 ) ; then lobby/nag/harangue them to honor that commitment , and to go further . Unenforceable in a strict legal sense , the plan nonetheless sets precedents , exerts a political force , and can act as a lever . If we use it . There 's much to do . At home , this 1996 election is truly the most critical in U.S. history . We must reclaim our government , halt the privatization of Congress , rebalance the rightward-tilting White House , refuse to let the country degenerate further into racial fear , sexual grief , articulated hatred . Internationally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more politically sophisticated than ever before , but we 've let our savvy ( plus our old terminal gratitude ) make us too polite . We must n't ever again settle for what we tolerated in Huairou , or for an old guard NGO Forum leadership that sells us out . Since China was the first country in all my travels where I 'd been unable to contact nonofficially approved women ( feminist independents and dissidents had been sent well out of the Beijing/Huairou area ) , I left frustrated . On my way home via Hong Kong , I read of a cigarette-lighter factory explosion in Sunde City , Guangdong  --  a tragedy that had left 60 women workers critically injured and more than 20 burned to death . Hong Kong-based unionists had entreated the Chinese government to lift the media ban on such accidents , and had appealed to the conference and forum , desperate to draw attention to conditions that mainland women factory workers face . Not one word of this tragedy had ever reached us in Beijing or Huairou . My anger at the government 's treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Chinese women  --  20 percent of all female people on earth . But wait . Nearly 60 percent of China 's population is under 25 , and half ( despite the resurgence of female infanticide ) is female . There 's a growing divorce rate-it 's doubled in Beijing over the past four years  --  and 70 percent of divorces are women-initiated . Since it 's women who hold up half the sky , the Chinese government should read the story of Chicken Little . g <p>                     @x " I do n't want to die ... again , " Laszlo groaned . <p> Jack knelt beside Laszlo 's sprawled body . " Can I fetch you anything ? A warm cup of Type O ? " <p> Laszlo covered his mouth . " Do n't talk about food . " <p> " Mi dispiace . " Jack patted the Vamp on the shoulder , the only spot on the guy 's shirt that was n't soaked with spewed Blissky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whiskey-flavored synthetic blood when everyone had toasted the groom , but obviously the little chemist was better at making Vampire Fusion Cuisine than ingesting it . He 'd promptly thrown up all over himself . <p> There was n't much anyone could do for the poor guy , so the bachelor party had raged on in full force while Laszlo rolled on the floor , his face clammy and pale . <p> " Shall I help you move to the couch ? " Jack asked . <p> " I might get blood on it , " Laszlo mumbled . <p> Jack frowned at the rich upholstery on the Louis XV-style furniture . " It 's already stained . " What a mess . How would he ever clean this up ? <p> He rose to his feet with a growing sense of doom . It had seemed like a great idea when he 'd reserved an Edwardian suite at the Plaza on Fifth Avenue to celebrate Ian MacPhie 's last night as a bachelor . But now he realized the hotel 's housekeeping service would wonder how an innocent party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of hand after Dougal arrived with his bagpipes . Ian had insisted on teaching everyone a Scottish jig . A dozen tipsy Vamps hopping around with glasses full of Blissky had resulted in a few collisions and even more stains on the carpet and furniture . <p> And then the phone call had come . The ladies were at Romatech Industries having a bridal shower , though Jack had heard that Vanda was bringing a male stripper from her Vamp nightclub . The ladies ' party had come to an abrupt halt when Shanna Draganesti had suddenly gone into labor . <p> Before teleporting to Romatech , Roman Draganesti had lamented that he was too inebriated to help his wife in her time of need . This had caused the other guys to rally around , declaring their undying support with a rowdy fight song . Then a dozen drunken male Vamps had teleported to Shanna 's side to cheer her on to victory . <p> Jack grinned as he imagined Shanna 's reaction , but the moment quickly faded . He had two hours before the sun rose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the adjoining bedroom drew his attention . Had one of the guys stayed behind ? Good , he could use the help . He strode into the luxurious bedroom and frowned at the naked VANNA lying on the bed , dripping Bleer on the satin comforter . <p> That had been Gregori 's bright idea . He 'd arrived at the party toting two Vampire Artificial Nutritional Needs Appliances , otherwise known as VANNAs . The lifelike rubber females were sex toys in the mortal world , but for Vamps , they 'd been modified with a battery-operated circulatory system . Gregori had filled the two sexy dolls with beer-flavored synthetic blood , and then he 'd invited the guys to have a bite . From the looks of the lacy clothes strewn about , the guys had had more fun undressing VANNA than nibbling on her . <p> A man 's voice drifted from the bathroom . " Oh , yeah , baby . Take it off ! " <p> Jack knocked on the bathroom door . " The party 's over . " <p> " The party 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , revealing Phineas McKinney . " What 's up , bro ? " <p> The young black Vamp looked debonair in his maroon velvet smoking jacket and white silk cravat , although the cavalier effect was marred somewhat by his SpongeBob boxer shorts . Like any vampire , Phineas did n't reflect in the bathroom 's gold-framed mirror , but the second VANNA did . The dark-tinted doll was sitting on the white marble vanity , wearing nothing but red silk panties and a silly grin on her face . <p> Jack was distracted for a moment when he noticed the words on Phineas 's shorts . Ladies dig the Sponge . " Ah , sorry to interrupt . " <p> Phineas 's face turned a bit red . " I was just practicing , you know . When you 're the Love Doctor , you got ta keep your mojo in top condition . " <p> " I understand . " <p> " I bet you do . " Phineas grabbed the black VANNA off the vanity . Her legs jutted stiffly forward like a Barbie doll , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real Casanova . " <p> " So they say , " Jack muttered . He could never escape his famous father 's reputation . " I suppose you were too busy to hear , but Shanna went into labor . All the guys left with Roman . Except Laszlo . He 's still sick . " <p> " No shit ? " Phineas strode into the bedroom with the black VANNA clasped under his arm . <p> " The sun will rise soon , so we need to clean up . " <p> Phineas glanced at the white VANNA on the bed in a pool of Bleer . " Damn , bro . We need professionals for this . How about Vampy Maids ? They clean Roman 's townhouse . " <p> " That would be great . Can you ring them ? " <p> " Do n't remember their number , but they 're in the Black Pages . " <p> They would never find the vampire version of a telephone book in the Plaza hotel . " Do you- " Jack was interrupted by a loud knock on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes lit up . " Maybe some real women ? " <p> " NYPD , " a male voice shouted . " Open the door , please . " <p> Jack sucked in a deep breath . Merda . <p> " Hot damn , " Phineas whispered . " It 's the po-po . " He looked around frantically . " We 're in deep shit . " <p> " Relax , " Jack whispered back . " I 'll use mind control to get rid of them . " <p> " I do n't do well with the police . " Phineas backed away . " I 'm outta here , man . " <p> " You 're leaving ? " Jack winced as the pounding on the door grew louder . <p> " Open the door now ! " the police officer yelled . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
