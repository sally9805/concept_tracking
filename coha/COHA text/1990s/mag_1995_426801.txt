The pleasures and pitfalls of the waning year <p> Bittersweet October . The mellow , messy , leaf-kicking , perfect pause between the opposing miseries of summer and winter . Mornings ( some of them ) start off foggy , the cold , soaked bumblebees buried , immobile , in the flower faces or maybe humbling around in the mulch , dirty and barely able to crawl , like drowsy drunks . Along the creek hordes of **25;269;TOOLONG starlings converse squeakily and incessantly as they breakfast among the hackberries.The wind comes up with the sun , batting away the fog and driving the ash leaves down , shower after golden shower , onto the lawn and into the street , where they hiss along the pavement . <p> The Japanese anemone ' Honorine Jobert ' , which looked so frail and hopeless when I planted her in March , has a few holes in her leaves , but she proudly waves a half-dozen pearllike flower buds and at least as many ivory-skinned blossoms .

The dry leaves blow where they will , even onto the neatest lawns ; an army of leaf-blowing landscape technicians could n't deter them . The crape myrtles ( surely they must be tired from all that blooming ) turn russet orange , and , like Cinderella at the ball , the common mulberry , so drab and unappreciated the remainder of the year , suddenly ( briefly ) glows brilliant yellow , a beacon of splendor . <p> In the late afternoon sun the mountain above us is a rusty amalgam of old-gold hickory , ruby-red dogwood , fire-lit sugar maple , pink and orange persimmon , and the fruit-basket hues of sassafras . The smoke trees along the winding roadsides are all fire and no smoke now , while nearer ground level Salvia azurea , as intensely blue as the October sky , mixes with the reblooming butterfly weed and prairie coneflower . <p> In the fields Queen Anne 's lace blooms anew with the golden aster . The velvet-stemmed staghorn sumac discards its red and purple leaves but holds the cones of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bird once winter settles in . Ginkgo tales <p> When we lived in Atlanta in the early 1970s , I made annual fall pilgrimages to all four of the known ( to me ) ginkgo trees within walking distance of the Ponce de Leon and Argonne Avenue intersection , where we lived , for I do n't believe I 've ever seen anything before or since to rival the stark beauty of a ginkgo at the all-too-brief peak of fall splendor , when every leaf is a single shade of pure , unblemished yellow . Then suddenly a squirrel sneezes , and every gorgeous leaf drops , seemingly at once . ( I 've never actually witnessed this phenomenon ; all I know is that one day the tree is a vertical splotch of pure yellow , and the next day the ground beneath the bare branches is a huge horizontal splotch of pure yellow . ) Of course , there is the occasional early freeze that browns the leaves before the anticipated spectacle gets under way , but this is rare . <p> Now near or beyond the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to western horticulture in 1730 from China , where it was discovered growing in temple gardens . It is the sole survivor of an ancient order of gymnosperms that , fernlike , requires the presence of water for its motile sperm to swim to the egg . ( No , I do n't know how the sperm gets from a boy tree to a girl tree , but I would love to see the pictures . ) As with other gymnosperms , the seed is considered " naked , " that is , not borne in a protective ovary , or seed case , though in this case it does have a fleshy outer wall . <p> Sometimes called maidenhair tree became the fan-shaped leaves resemble those of the maidenhair fern , ginkgo is a slow-growing tree ( unless prodded with fertilizer and water ) with massive potential and a lifespan measured in centuries . It casts a filtered shade under which grass will grow , particularly if lower limbs are removed . <p> I do n't know why the ginkgo is rare-to-nonexistent in the wild , for it is easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil , and is essentially pest- and disease-free . ( Perhaps its former enemies are now extinct . ) It has an easily transplanted fibrous root system . <p> Unless you move a lot , you 'll be living with your ginkgo for a long time , so purchase only a male clone that exhibits the growth habit your landscape can accommodate . ' Mayfield ' , for example , is a narrow , columnar male , reminiscent of Lombardy poplar , which might be grouped for a vertical accent or lined up to define a boundary , if such soldierly formality seems called for . I 've seen this or a similar columnar form used with the nearly as rare ( in the wild , that is ) and ancient dawn redwood ( Metasequoia glyptostroboides ) . ' Autumn Gold ' and ' Saratoga ' are among the more spreading male selections of ginkgo known for outstanding fall color . <p> Female trees are equally lovely and desirable in every way except that the grape-size , persimmonlike , overripe seeds with which they litter the ground in autumn raise a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraternity house bathroom the morning after homecoming . Stick to male clones or prepare to issue clothespins to your neighbors for their noses a few decades hence , when your female ginkgo reaches sexual maturity . ( Actually , the kernel inside the seed coat is used as food in the Orient , an acquired taste , I 'm sure . ) <p> My husband and I learned the hard way that there 's another good reason to treat yourself to a tried-and-true named selection . When we bought our Ewing Street house , I wasted no time in ordering a ginkgo . Our nameless , bargain bare-root tree arrived at sundown some days later . Flashlight in hand , we eagerly trudged out into the dark to insert this curious little wooden skeleton into the ground . Somehow we ran out of backfill and finished covering the stubby , triple-pronged roots with virgin cat litter . <p> Soon our ginkgo stick sprouted branches , which grew akimbo , as if they had no idea which way to go . When fall came , we waited in vain for the colorful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in catalog history with absolutely no fall color . I could n't believe it , but year after year this weird little tree turned from light green directly to brown , so consider yourself warned . Vines for fall <p> All of the grapes , both domesticated and wild , take on wondrous fall coloring . The native muscadine , or scuppernong ( Vitis rotundifolia ) , conceals a rusty chain-link fence as well as any vine alive , provides luscious red-purple fruit for man and beast alike ( another acquired taste ) , and gives radiant yellow fall color . The grapes are rampant woody vines , ultimately as big around at the base as a person 's arm , and so will likely need pruning in all but the wildest settings , particularly if ample fruit production is a consideration . They grow more vigorously in sun than shade but do well enough in either , as they do in most soils that are n't actually under water . <p> My favorite vine for October color is never seen in catalogs , though it hangs like a curtain from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or coralbeads ( Cocculus catolinus ) , is a twining vine whose faintly fuzzy yet glossy leaves vary from heart- to ivy-leaf-shaped , even on a given stem . <p> The vine is dioecious , that is , the elongate panicles of insignificant male and female flowers appear on separate plants . In October , just as the leaves begin to yellow , the clustered berrylike drupes on female plants turn a brilliant , lacquered red , presenting a rich , triple-tone effect . The fruit is savored by birds , which is how I 've come to have several of these handsome and ( I think ) mannerly vines along our back fence . Mum 's the word <p> October doorsteps sprout pumpkins and potted chrysanthemums as damp logs sprout toadstools . Since chrysanthemums are troublesome little buggers to grow properly , many of us just pick up a pot or two at the garden center in September , when they start to come into bloom . ( I suppose one could save money by simply removing them from someone else 's front steps , but this is tacky and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall-purchased mums are often root-bound and , if set into the garden , seldom become established before freezing weather and are thus lost over winter . <p> Irritatingly , the taxonomists , who came to this planet strictly to wreak turmoil among garden writers and make our $135 copies of Hortus Third obsolete even before we 've torn up the dust jacket , have raked up nearly all of the herbaceous perennials we 've come to know and love as members of the genus Chrysanthemum and dumped them instead into a new genus , Dendranthema . ( Our old hybrid friend the Shasta daisy now resides in the genus Leucanthemum . ) <p> Perhaps I lack sensitivity , but to me the chrysanthemum  --  er , dendranthema  --  fine and rich in variety as it is , is just another excellent fall garden flower . But in some gardeners mums inspire a kind of lunacy that crowds out all thoughts of spouse , kids , cats , dogs , and dinner at 6 P.M. sharp . <p> This foolishness ( which , I warn you , is contagious ) started centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plaguelike , across many cultures clear around the world . The result has been the development of an unprepossessing daisy into a panorama of elaborate floral forms ( spiders , spoons , pompoms , quills , etc. ) and downright acrobatic habits ( cushiony mounds , spheres , treeform standards , and the topiarian Japanese cascades , fans , fountains , and umbrellas ) . The color range now spans the spectrum save for true blue . <p> Chrysanthemums are easily moved , even in bud or bloom , so that a cool-colored summer bedding scheme might suddenly be converted into a warm-toned autumnal display by the removal of spent annuals and their replacement with bright-hued mums . Just be sure to water the chrysanthemums well before and after the operation . <p> Cushion mums can be grown from cuttings three to a pot in an out-of-the-way sunny spot and plopped onto the porch or into the garden in September , where they 'll bring down-to-earth solidity to an airy mix of salvias and wild asters . A minimum of six hours of full sun daily is needed for good flower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they 'll go on and bloom just fine even in shade . <p> Chrysanthemums set their flower buds in response to decreasing day length and , to some extent , night temperature . Exposure to artificial light sources , such as streetlights or even car headlights , may prevent or delay bloom . <p> There are two things that make chrysanthemums more bothersome to grow than most other garden flowers , the first being that , for best results , the clumps must be dug up every spring and new plants started from cuttings or outside shoots , and , second , all but the low-growing , self-branching cultivars require repetitive pinching back to achieve the desired fullness and/or staking to keep the eventual blooms from wallowing in the dirt . <p> The moundlike cushion mums , which require little pinching or staking , are best for landscape use and pot culture . Mary Lou McNabb , who grows the finest chrysanthemums in these parts , recommends several particularly effective combinations of cushion mums . The triple-toned yellow ' Jessica ' shares the same height and an early October bloom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bronze ' Denise ' blooms with the lavender ' Lynn ' in late October , while the brilliant yellow ' Sunny Morning ' blooms for six full weeks . It is attractive with the bronzy-red ' Bravo ' . <p> Mary Lou is convinced that chrysanthemums are more likely to survive winter if they are not cut back until spring . She never mulches her mums but dresses them generously with rich , coffee-dark homemade compost in April or May . The only other fertilizer she uses is muriate of potash ( potassium chloride ) . One teaspoon per plant applied around the first of August helps , she says , to develop vibrant color and strong stems . <p> You can , of course , fertilize mums , preferably with a low-nitrogen product and then not too close to season 's end , when new , tender growth may prove frost-susceptible . Certain soils , particularly sandy , acid ones , are deficient in magnesium , a constituent of chlorophyll . Yellowing of the lower leaves is a symptom . One-quarter pound of Epsom salts dissolved in a gallon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in The Chrysanthemum Book . <p> Mums are shallow-rooted and fairly thirsty but must have porous , well-drained soil , since they are prone to winter rot . A pH of around 6 or 6.5 is about right . <p> In April Mary Lou takes four-inch cuttings , which she roots in Pro-Mix or sand and perlite . These go out into the garden on 18-inch centers in May . Chicken wire stretched across the beds a few inches above the ground discourages her dogs from digging up or trampling plants and provides the mums with support , preventing them from flopping open in the center after a heavy rain . <p> All but the most compact cultivars benefit from pinching or shearing back . Shearing plants to six inches also temporarily eliminates the black aphids that congregate near the stem tips . <p> Local lore dictates that one should pinch mums back until the Fourth of July and prone no more after that so that plants will have time to form buds and bloom before frost . Cumming allows the upper South to pinch until August 1 , the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until August 15 , and the lower South until September 1 . I believe one may safely pinch back some varieties later than others . My most enduring mum , ' Yellow Jacket ' , a dwarf , bushy mop of shaggy yellow flower heads , often blooms well into November , resisting frost and the first few freezes . ' Sunny Morning ' does the same , according to Mary Lou . Mum beds can be covered with Reemay ( spun-bonded polyester ) for added frost protection . Fall tickseeds <p> The closely related Bidens and Coreopsis are known as tickseeds . The white-flowering Bidens species that Willodene Matthews brought back from south Alabama contributes great sparkle to the backyard garden in autumn . <p> The one-and-a-half-inch composite flowers consist of a ring of broad white ray flowers surrounding a center of orange disk flowers . The seeds , which are manufactured by the thousands , are needlelike stick-tights with an exasperating proclivity for working their way through clothing and into bare skin . <p> Make no mistake about it , this is a weed , but a worthwhile weed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an equal spread , so it is best to force compact growth by cutting back its segmented foliage a time or two during the season . My friend , Inge Paul , grows Bidens polylepsis , a larger-flowering golden tickseed , which , like the white species , is a perfect companion for Salvia coccinea and other late-flowering salvias . October chores <p> It 's tempting to let the garden go now , since all the world is a bit of a mess at this time of year , but then , of course , we realize that our asters , for instance , will show to better effect if they 're not overshadowed by a twiggy forest of dead and dying Rudbeckia triloba . And so a bit of housekeeping is in order . <p> If we look carefully , we 'll see seedlings of next spring 's larkspur and nemophila coming up , so it is imperative that we get down on all fours and scratch out the germinating violets and dead nettle that will surely shade them out if they 're not dealt with quickly . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where a resident from the distant past evidently had a real lawn and no doubt eradicated the competition with broad-leaf weed killers . The backyard beds , however , are a different story . ) <p> If seed of butterfly weed ( Asclepias tuberosa ) is to be collected , now is the time , for soon the okralike pods will split and the seeds will be transported on gossamer wings to parts unknown . <p> The twin seedpods of Aresonia taber-naemontana , too , will soon spill their cargo . Amsonia seems to seed itself rather inefficiently in the wild . But you or I can peel open the pods , and the cigarlike seeds , which are lined up single file like the cars on a train , will stream out into an envelope , which we can refrigerate until spring . Better yet , we can go ahead and shallowly plant where we hope one day to see more cool blue amsonias . <p> October is the perfect time to set out pansies , for they 'll have a chance to become established and start to grow before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 'll also be more likely to put on a welcome show during winter warm spells . If I could bear to rip out my fall marigolds and the melampodium , I would certainly set my pansies out in October . As it is ( as I am ) , I set out my pansies as I clear my beds after frost , in November . Usually I mix in a handful of organic matter ( the ground-up leaves , grass clippings , and pine straw I 've just collected from the neighbors ' curbs ) , fertilize , water , and mulch them well . Be sure to keep your pansies watered , both while they 're in the flat and during winter dry spells . Even though they 're mulched , pansies grown in raised beds are quick to dry out in sunny , windy winter weather . <p> I mulch all the shrubs heavily in fall and mulch each mixed bed as I clean it off . I heap the pine straw around the azaleas , rhododendrons , and dogwoods . <p> If you 've ordered bulbs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like , set them out as they arrive or store them in the vegetable bin , checking on them frequently to make sure they do n't dry out . <p> Gather materials for winter arrangements and hang them upside down to air-dry in a warm , dark room . Salvia , ' Silver King ' artemisia , purple cone-flower , dusty miller , goldenrod , hydrangea , lamb 's ears , Queen Anne 's lace , zinnia , and ornamental grasses are relatively easy candidates for drying . <p> Frequent contributor Carol Bishop Hipps lives and gardens in Huntsville , Alabama .
