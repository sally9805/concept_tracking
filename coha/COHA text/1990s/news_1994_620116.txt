<p> CARTOONIST 'S WINGS SHOULD BE CLIPPED <p> Editor  --  The Oliphant cartoon ( October 13 ) showing " Icarus Huffington and his upwardly mobile Greek " indicates a double standard . One can not imagine a cartoon identifying a politician 's spouse as an " upwardly mobile African American " or " upwardly mobile Latino " or " upwardly mobile Jew . " <p> The Greeks , however , may be openly disparaged in one of the most liberal cities in the United States  --  although they have attained one of the highest income and educational levels among ethnic groups in the United States . <p> Like the Jews and Asians , the qualities that have made Greeks successful have also made them suspect to society at large , but unlike these larger and more organized groups , anti-Greek portrayals in the media go largely unchallenged . It is not considered " politically incorrect " to make fun of Greeks . <p> The qualities for which Mrs. Huffington is being excoriated ( ambition , shrewdness , double-dealing ) are the qualities successful minorities are always accused of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign is a strong dose of anti-Greek prejudice . <p> It is ironic that forces that fancy themselves " liberal " and oppose Huffington 's candidacy on political and partisan grounds , feel no shame in exploiting lingering anti- Greek prejudices to reach their " progressive " political ends . <p> BISHOP ANTHONY GERGIANNAKIS <p> Greek Orthodox Diocese <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> THE CHURCH IN IRELAND <p> Editor  --  Frank Viviano 's articles on Northern Ireland ( October 6 and 8 ) were well-researched and well-written . One correction does not detract from that conclusion . <p> To repeat , like a mantra , the cliche " the Irish Republic , dominated by the Catholic Church " is like saying " Utah , dominated by Mormons "  --  true by raw population figures but false by implication . There is no union of church and state by law in Utah or Ireland  --  as there is in Britain , where the clergy of the Anglican Church are paid from tax monies . <p> Viviano asserts that the Catholic religion is taught in the Irish public schools : again true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain and Ireland essentially agree : They afford parents choice in education . Parents may select either public or religious schools  --  Catholic , Protestant or Jewish  --  for their children that are subsidized substantially by tax money , a recognition of the family as the primary unit in society . <p> BISHOP MARK J. HURLEY <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> STATE HAD NO CHOICE <p> Editor  --  Ricardo A. Woods committed a brutal crime that should have led to his execution . If he had been tried and convicted in California under today 's laws , he would be facing the death penalty . But to imply , as your story does ( " Paroled Cop Killer From Ohio Stirs Furor , " September 30 ) , that California willingly took this known cop-killer is far from the truth . <p> According to a legal analysis of the agreement prepared in 1989 by Benjamin J. Jones , director of the Council of State Governments Center for Law &; Justice , " When a parolee or probationer meets both the residency and employment requirements , a potential receiving state can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If both residency and employment requirements are met , the receiving state has no discretion under the terms of the com pact to refuse a parolee or probationer from a sending state . " <p> The Chronicle 's report does not mention that California has 2,454 parolees being supervised in other states , while we have 1,966 parolees from other states in California , a difference of nearly 500 parolees . In other words , California clearly benefits from this compact . <p> Preliminary data indicate that this trend will continue as a result of the passage of the " three strikes " law Governor Wilson signed in March . Early data show that the number of parolees in California from other states has dropped from 2,157 in March to 1,966 in September , while the number of California parolees out of state has increased from 2,204 in March to 2,454 in September . <p> I am not trying to defend Mr. Woods or his parole . As a former police officer , it infuriates me that any state would release a cop killer . But the implication that California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> JOE G. SANDOVAL , Secretary <p> California Youth and Adult <p> Correctional Agency <p> Sacramento <p> . <p> PALESTINIAN STORY <p> Editor  --  The abduction and killing of an Israeli soldier , Nachson Waxman , by Hamas members has all the drama needed to capture readers ' sympathy . However , this story , while undeniably true , fails to address the hundreds and thousands of similar such stories occurring on a daily basis in the occupied territories , where for years , thousands of youths , often as young as 8 years old , have been randomly subjected to interrogations , beatings , detentions without cause , mock trials , torture and often death . <p> These are stories that have not been told , mothers whose tears have not been photographed , families whose anguish has not been recognized or addressed by any member of the world community . These are the Palestinians , victims of occupation in their own land . Obviously , their stories are not of the same value as one Israeli soldier . <p> AMEENA SIDDIQUI <p> Berkeley <p> . <p> STOP PROP . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Proposition O 's $ 1 per square foot annual transit assessment on so-called " downtown " San Francisco will fall equally on the top-floor corporate headquarters in the Transamerica Building and small San Francisco businesses least able to afford it . <p> Neighborhood physicians , den tists , accountants , travel agencies , graphic design studios , art galleries that frequently occupy above street-level , low-rent office or loft space ( typically , $ 1 a square foot per month , or less ) in North Beach , Chinatown , the Geary Corridor and the SOMA district will face an annual tax bill equal to one month 's rent ! Proposition " O " is grossly unfair to these small businesses , which already pay higher taxes here than anywhere else in the Bay Area . <p> Passage of the measure would encourage the beneficiaries of City Hall largesse to promulgate a flood tide of irresponsible , special assessment districts for any portion of the city that can be shown to receive a proportionately greater share of some city service . For example , an assessment district for homes immediately adjacent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourage politicians , like Supervisor Sue Bierman , to follow the easy tax-and-spend path in a continued failed attempt to solve the city 's fiscal problems . <p> JIM HIRSCH <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> SPEAKING UP FOR AGRICULTURE <p> Editor  --  California 's No. 1 industry , agriculture , represents economic activity in excess of $ 18 billion annually . Congressman Michael Huffington and Senator Dianne Feinstein have been in the U.S. Congress for the same period . Can anyone find a single instance in which the congressman has advocated an agricultural issue ? It 's pretty hard to find anything he has done in the past 20 months , except campaign for the Senate . <p> Mr. Huffington has repeatedly stated that Senator Feinstein is no friend of agriculture because of her past backing of the Big Green initiative and the Central Valley Project Improvement Act . <p> The fact is that neither Senator Feinstein nor Michael Huffington held elected office at the time these issues occurred . However , Mr. Huffington was in a leadership position at the Natural Resources Defense Council , which sponsored the Alar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington and sponsored the Big Green initiative . It is currently advocating tearing down Friant Dam to restore the San Joaquin River salmon fishery . <p> Mr. Huffington at first denied then later affirmed his involvement with the organization , to which he was a major contributor . How much of his Texas oil fortune did he give to the organization that is agriculture 's worst nightmare ? <p> JEAN P. SAGOUSPE <p> Los Banos <p> . <p> DESERT PORK <p> Editor  --  Regarding your editorial on the Desert Protection Act ( October 11 ) , you failed to inform your readers of the entire context of the piece of legislation . I listened to the reading of the entire bill on C-Span and was utterly appalled at the amount of pork attached to the bill . <p> Millions of dollars are going to be spent for a jazz cultural center in New Orleans , additional monies will be spent in Arkansas , Illinois , etc. , for projects with no correlation to the act , yet you fail to mention this . <p> Another example of your failure to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Senator Dianne Feinstein was a co-sponsor . If you had taken the time to read this legislation , you would have realized that the California taxpayer is going to shell out $ 100 million that will go to other states of the Union . <p> RAYMOND D.
