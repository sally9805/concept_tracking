EVEN BEFORE HER ROLE OPPOsite Kevin Costner in The Bodyguard made her a movie star , there was something cinematic about Whitney Houston . Her life has been big time and big screen . The daughter of gospel and R.-and-B. singer Cissy Houston , she began at the top with her 1985 debut album , Whitney Houston , and has sold 80 million records worldwide since . Her sweet lyrics ( Did n't We Almost Have It All ) recall the classic romances of Hollywood in the 1940s ; her adventurous vocals ( in songs like her majestic megahit I Will Always Love You ) have the grandiosity of a Spielberg epic . And her 1992 marriage to controversial hip-hop singer Bobby Brown  --  an unlikely pairing that has fascinated the gossip press  --  has some of the urban grit of a Hughes brothers film . <P> Interviewed recently on a beach near her getaway home in Miami , Houston , 32 , projected the contradictions . As she arrived clad in a form-fitting purple dress , hand in hand with Brown  --  the two have reconciled after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to swoop down for an adoring close-up . Yet she also flashed some feisty homegirl attitude . " People think I 'm Miss Prissy Pooh-Pooh , but I 'm not ; I like to have fun , " she says , jabbing a finger in the air . " I can get down , really freakin ' dirty with you . I was born in Newark , New Jersey , with two brothers and a very strong father . It made me tough  --  perhaps too tough . " <P> " Tough " is not a word usually associated with Houston or her music . " Safe " and " homogenized " are , though not always fairly . She has a towering , dynamic voice , but when she sings material that 's too slight for her skills ( such as Love Is a Contact Sport ) , it 's an unseemly mismatch , like Grant Hill dunking on a fifth-grader . But when Houston takes on a tune worthy of her gifts ( like You Give Good Love ) , the result is something winged , almost seraphic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's The Bodyguard  --  the movie made more than $400 million at the box office worldwide , while the sound track sold 33 million copies  --  she 's proved she has multimedia clout . <P> She 's ready to prove it again . Just before Christmas , Houston will be seen in Waiting to Exhale , the movie adaptation of Terry McMillan 's popular novel about the lives of four black women . The sound track , containing three numbers by Houston , has just arrived in the stores and is already racking up hefty sales . In January Houston starts shooting The Preacher 's Wife , a remake of the 1947 Cary Grant  --  Loretta Young comedy The Bishop 's Wife , co-starring Denzel Washington , and she 's at work on a gospel sound track for the film . Meanwhile , in search of projects to produce as well as star in , Houston has signed a development deal with Disney . Her first acquisition : the rights to a biography of actress Dorothy Dandridge . Says Houston : " I heard Janet Jackson wanted to play Dorothy very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll do it . If not , maybe I 'll let Janet do it . "
