He would appear on the doorstep of fellow mathematicians without warning  --  a frail , disheveled , elderly man , hopped up on amphetamines and wearing a ratty raincoat  --  and announce , in a thick Hungarian accent , " My mind is open . " For a day , or a week or a month , the man or woman who answered the knock would have to take nonstop care of this helpless guest who could n't figure out how to cut a grapefruit or wash his underwear  --  and in return would be permitted the exhausting , exhilarating experience of following the thought processes of Paul Erdos , the most prolific and arguably the cleverest mathematician of the century . <P> In a profession with no shortage of oddballs , he was the strangest . Erdos had no home , no possessions and no life aside from mathematics . He spoke a language all his own : " died " meant someone had stopped doing math ; " left " meant the person had died ; God was the " Supreme Fascist . " <P> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoarding his ideas , he shared them with all comers . Indeed , as many as half a dozen mathematicians would sometimes gather to wrestle with Erdos ' provocative notions about integers , whole numbers and primes  --  furiously scribbling complex proofs as the old man flitted among them , imparting astonishingly acute insights in wholesale lots . <P> By the time he " left " at the age of 83 , in 1996 , Erdos had collaborated with an unprecedented 485 colleagues . Other mathematicians simply solved problems ; Erdos solved problems and pushed at least four generations to dig deeper into the mysterious nature of numbers . <P>  --  By Michael D.
