My brother 's first serious girlfriend was eight years older twenty-eight to his twenty . Her name was Julia Cathcart , and Henry introduced her to us in early June . They drove from Manhattan down to our cottage in Loveladies , on the New Jersey shore . When his little convertible , his pet , pulled into the driveway , she was behind the wheel . My mother and I were watching from the kitchen window . I said , " He lets her drive his car . " My brother and his girlfriend were dressed alike , baggy white shirts tucked into jeans , except she had a black cashmere sweater over her shoulders . She had dark eyes , high cheekbones , and beautiful skin , pale , with high coloring in her cheeks like a child with a fever . Her hair was back in a loose ponytail , tied with a piece of lace , and she wore tiny pearl earrings . I thought maybe she 'd look older than Henry , but it was Henry who looked older than Henry . Standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown a beard , for starters , and had on new wire-rim sunglasses that made him appear more like a bon vivant than a philosophy major between colleges . His hair was longer , and , not yet lightened by the sun , it was the reddish-brown color of an Irish setter . He gave me a kiss on the cheek , as though he always had . Then he roughed around with our Airedale , Atlas , while his girlfriend and mother shook hands . They were clasping fingertips , ladylike , smiling as though they were already fond of each other and just waiting for details to fill in why . Julia turned to me and said , " You must be Janie . " " Most people call me Jane now , " I said , making myself sound even younger . " Jane , " she said , possibly in the manner of an adult trying to take a child seriously . Henry unpacked the car and loaded himself up with everything they 'd brought , little bags and big ones , a string tote , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his girlfriend said , " Do you have the wine , Hank ? " Whoever Hank was , he had it . Except for bedrooms and the screened-in porch , our house was just one big all-purpose room , and Henry was giving her a jokey tour of it : " This is the living room , " he said , gesturing to the sofa ; he paused , gestured to it again and said , " This is the den . " Out on the porch , she stretched her legs in front of her Audrey Hepburn relaxing after dance class . She wore navy espadrilles . I noticed that Henry had on penny Loafers without socks , and he 'd inserted a subway token in the slot where the penny belonged . Julia sipped her iced tea and asked how Loveladies got its name . We did n't know , but Henry said , " It was derived from the Indian name of the founder . " Julia smiled , and asked my mother how long we 'd been coming here . " This is our first year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tennis , and without him present , I felt free to add a subversive , " We used to go to Nantucket . " " Nantucket is lovely , " Julia said . " It is lovely , " my mother conceded , but went on to cite drab points in New Jersey 's favor , based on its proximity to our house in Philadelphia . In the last of our New Jersey versus Nantucket debates , I 'd argued , forcefully I 'd thought , that Camden was even closer . I 'd almost added that the trash dump was practically in walking distance , but my father had interrupted . I could tell he was angry , but he kept his voice even : we could go to the shore all year round , he said , and that would help us to be a closer family . " Not so far , " I said , meaning to add levity . But my father looked at me with his eyes narrowed , like he was n't sure I was his daughter after all . My mother smiled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water ! I 'd be able to walk right out the door and go swimming ! Only then did I understand that they 'd already chosen a house ; they 'd put a bid on it . " It 's on the ocean ? " I asked . " Close , " she said , trying to maintain her enthusiasm . " The bay , " I said to myself . " It does have a spectacular view of the bay , " she said , but , no , our house was on a lagoon , a canal . " Like Venice , " she 'd said , as though this would mean something to me . Now Julia asked if we swam in there , and my mother said , " Absolutely . " I did n't want to acid rain on my mother 's parade , but the lagoon had oil floating on the surface and the bottom was sewagey soft . I was surprised how long Henry sat with us on the porch , as my mother turned the topic to summer , touching upon such controversial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best ) , mosquitoes ( pesky ) , and tennis ( good exercise ) . Finally , Henry did get up . He went outside as though on a mission . He might be going to check my crab traps or to see if we 'd brought the bikes ; he could do whatever he wanted . My father was the same way : a houseful of guests , and my mother 's duty was to provide food , drink , fun , and conversation , while my father 's was to nap or read . While Mother hostessed and Girlfriend guested , Younger Sister stood up . When there was a pause in their nicing , I made my mouth move smileward : I 'd love to stay and talk , but I have to go shoot some heroin now . * * * For dinner , we had crabs I 'd caught off the dock . My mother covered the table with newspaper , and we all got print on our arms . As a surprise , she served preseason Silver Queen , little nuggets of mush . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typewriter-style ; usually , he 'd tap the cob at the end of a row and ding . In response to my mother 's questions , Julia told us about her brother in San Francisco and sister in Paris , both of whom would be " attending " her mother 's annual " gala " in Southampton . Julia chose her words carefully and used ones I 'd never heard spoken she sounded to me like she was trying out for a job as a dictionary . My mother eyed me : Do not smirk . However slowly Julia spoke , she opened her crabs twice as fast as anyone else , and I asked how she did it . She showed me the key on the belly side and how to pull it so the shell lifted right off . Henry leaned over to watch , too . My father asked about the publishing house where she and Henry worked . Julia described their boss as an exquisite editor and true gentleman . My brother had a laugh-smile on when he said , " Every morning when we 're opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Did we get any dough , babies ? ' " I 'd met this exquisite editor and true gentleman myself when I 'd visited Henry ; and I repeated now that Mr. McBride had told me my brother " Aaron " was irreplaceable . My father said , " Hank Aaron , " almost to himself . " Mr. McBride must be forgiven , " Julia said , " as a baseball aficionado and octogenarian . " I thought , Exquisite octogenarians and aficionados will be attending the gala . Then I asked my question : " Do they know about you two at work ? " My father shot me a look ; and I looked back at him , Why is everything I want to know wrong ? Henry changed the topic : he 'd been promoted from intern to assistant . I could tell he expected my parents to be pleased , and I saw right away that my father , at least , was n't . It was harder to tell with my mother ; she wore the mask in the family . The issue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided if he was starting Columbia in the fall . He 'd already transferred four times , or five counting twice to Brown . The reasons he gave for transferring each time were always sound and logical , like " better course selection . " I wondered about the reasons he did n't say . * * * Before bed , my mother told Julia she 'd be staying with me my cue . I led her down the hall to my bedroom , which was completely taken up by a built-in bunk-bed complex ; it slept four but , I realized , lived only one comfortably . " A bunk , " she said , as though charmed . " Like camp . " A cell , I thought . Like prison . I asked which bunk she wanted ; she chose the near bottom , which meant the far top for me . I got fresh towels for her and left her alone to undress ; then I knocked on my door , and she said , " Come in . " She was already under the covers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my bunk and swept the sand off my sheets . We said good night . After a few minutes , though , a door slammed , and I had to explain that the doorjambs in this house did n't stick ; the doors would be opening and slamming all night . Then " good night " " good night " again . I closed my eyes and tried to pretend I was in Nantucket . The house we 'd rented every year there had a widow 's walk a square porch on the roof , where the wives of sea captains were supposed to have watched for their husbands ' ships . At night , we 'd hear creaks and moans . Once , I thought I heard footsteps pacing the widow 's walk . You could feel the ghosts in that house , scaring you in the best way . If there were any ghosts in this one , they were n't moaning about husbands lost at sea but slamming doors over modern , trivial matters , such as not being allowed to go waterskiing . I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could n't sleep either . We lay awake in the dark , listening to each other . The silence between us seemed both intimate and hostile , like a staring contest . But Julia was just waiting for me to fall asleep so she could go down the hall to my brother 's room . I heard her bare feet on the wood floor and Henry 's door whisper open and close . * * * My father and Henry went to look at sailboats to buy , though I suspected talk about Columbia . My mother , Julia , and I took a walk on the beach . I walked behind them , in and out of the water , looking for sea glass . My mother was describing the exhibit we 'd happened on the last time we were in New York dishes , silverware , and crystal used by royalty and Julia had seen the exhibit herself , on purpose . The museum was like the house of a rich old woman who did n't want you to visit ; everyone had whispered and stepped lightly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The guest book requested comments , and my mother , who never missed a chance to compliment anyone , had written how finely curated the exhibit was . I 'd written , " Bored nearly to death . " I experienced this anew listening to them talk tableware . They loved the same plates for the same reasons with the same enthusiasm , and I thought , Henry is going out with Mom . * * * When I told Henry , he said , " My sister the Freudian . " Julia was doing my jobs in the kitchen , setting the table and helping her soul twin prepare an early supper . I was sitting on Henry 's bed , while he packed to go back to New York . He always did something else while we talked changed the station on the radio , flipped through a magazine , tuned his guitar . He did n't have to look at me ; he knew I 'd still be there , with my next question . " You should read Freud , " he said , and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handy . He did n't , but went on saying what a great writer Freud was , as though this was what I wanted to talk about in our only moments alone all weekend . I remembered to thank him for the last book he 'd sent to me from work , by a Norwegian philosopher , and he said , " Did you try it ? " " Yeah , " I said , " I spent about a month reading it one afternoon . " He turned to me and said , " Do you know that your IQ goes up and down about fifty points in every conversation ? " I did n't know if this was a compliment or an insult , but I did n't like how he was looking at me as though from the great distance of his new life . I said , " No one likes being talked about to their face . " Then I felt bad . " Anyway , " I said , " E=MC . " Henry smiled and opened a drawer . He told me that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to understand that philosophy through the thickest accent you 've ever heard , " he said . " Now add a harelip . " But everyone was pretending to understand the lecture , he said , and he imitated serious note scribbling . Then he interrupted himself he 'd spotted Freud on the bottom shelf . He flipped through the book for the passage he wanted me to hear and found it . " Okay , Freud says : In sending the young out into life with such a false psychological orientation ' about sex , it 's as though one were to equip people starting out on a Polar expedition with summer clothes and maps of the Italian lakes . ' " He shook his head . " And that 's a footnote , " he said . " A footnote . " I said , " You look like Commodore Peary with your beard . " He touched his face , absently , the way bearded men do . Then he handed the book Civilization and Its Discontents to me . " So , " I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone ? " He told me to go easy on Julia ; she was nervous about meeting Mom and Dad . " Try to think of it from her side . " I decided I would later . He picked a purple shirt out of his closet . " Want this ? " He tossed it to me . " I bought it at a thrift shop in Berkeley , " he said , referring to his last internship , a behavior-modification lab where he 'd trained herd dogs not to herd . I said , " I think I saw you more when you lived there . " He told me that he and Julia would come to the shore again in a few weeks . " I might not recognize you by then , " I said . " You 'll probably show up in a suit and tie . " " What are you talking about ? " " You seem older , " I said . " I am older . " " Three months should n't make this much of a difference , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he stopped and looked at me . " You 're Hank now , " I said . " You bring Mom and Dad a bottle of wine . " Then he sat down on the bed with me . " I might be growing up , " he said . " I 'm probably not , but let 's say I am . Is that a reason to be mad at me ? " I looked at the purple shirt in my lap . It had a big ink stain on the pocket . Then Julia called us to dinner . " Come on , " he said . Dinner : talk of great books everyone had read or planned to , except me . Julia had just read one by a famous author I 'd never heard of and proclaimed it " extraordinary . " I thought , You read too much . At good-bye , I could tell how much both my parents liked her , and not just for Henry 's sake ; Julia was the kind , helpful , articulate daughter they deserved . * * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I calculated what an eight-year age difference would mean to me a six-year-old boy and thought of the one next door . I said , " It 's like me going out with Willy Schwam . " My mother pretended not to hear . I could hear the smile in my father 's voice when he said that the important thing was that Willy and I were happy . " I was dubious at first , " I said . " I thought I might be just another baby-sitter to him . But then , one night " My mother interrupted . " I think I 'm going to be ill . " I never talked to either of my parents seriously about love , let alone sex . The closest we 'd come was talking about drugs , which I was n't interested in. * * * On the last day of school , I realized I had no plans for the summer . Instead of looking forward to Nantucket in August , I 'd be at home in the suburbs and at the shore in New Jersey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends who were going off on wilderness adventures and teen tours , to camps with Indian names and Israel . We traded addresses and each time I wrote mine I felt the impending boredom of the summer days to come . When one friend asked what I 'd be doing at home , I found myself saying , " I might get a job . " I told my parents at dinner . My mother said , " I thought you were going to take art classes and work on your tennis . " " I could get a part-time job , " I said . " Maybe you could work in Dad 's office again , " she said , looking over at him . I liked seeing Dad in action , the Chief of Neurology in his white coat , as he shook patients ' hands and ushered them into his office . But I said , " I need new experiences , Mom . " " What about an internship , " she suggested , " in something you 're interested in ? " I reminded her that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to draw , " she said . I told them I was thinking of being a waitress . My dad said , " Practice by clearing the table . " * * * I went through the help wanted section of the newspaper , but every job seemed to require experience . I called anyway to make my case , using the words I read in the paper : " I 'm a detail-oriented self-starter . " No luck , though . I gave in to a summer of art classes and tennis , swimming at my friend Linda 's , and going on errands with my mother . The nights were quiet . Dinner , and then I went up to my bedroom and wrote letters to my friends or sketched . I drew people standing in groups , as though posed for a photograph that would go in an album . My father read his magazines , the green-covered Neurology and Stroke , up in his study . My mother read the newspaper in the breakfast room . She would call up to him , asking if he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and back up to deliver the peach or plum or nectarine . Before bed , I walked Atlas , while I smoked a forbidden cigarette . Most nights , I passed Oliver Biddle , who was middle-aged , yet lived with his parents my own personal cautionary tale walking a miniature schnauzer . He was suburban-soft in stretchy clothes a grandfather would wear for golf , and he puffed a cigar . I 'd heard rumors that he was retarded or a genius , but I did n't believe either . Oliver Biddle was who you became if you could n't find anyone to love except your parents . I 'd say , " Hello , Oliver , " and then , to his schnauzer , " Evening , Pepper . " Oliver said hello back , but always after a delay , as though each time deciding whether to answer . By the time he did , I 'd be at least a few steps away and I 'd say , " Good night , " as though we 'd passed the evening together . * * * Julia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shore when we arrived . She 'd made dinner , and seemed more relaxed . Henry seemed hardly to have aged at all . After dessert , they invited me to go with them to the arts center for a Russian film with English subtitles . I said , " I do n't like to read during movies , " and once Julia laughed it became a joke and made me feel that I was irrepressibly witty . So I went with them . It was the bleakest movie I 'd ever seen ; everyone died of heartbreak or starvation or both . At home , Julia threw herself on the sofa in Slavic despair and said , " Please to get me some wodka . " They did n't kiss or hold hands in front of me , though once , at lunch , Henry sort of rubbed my foot under the table , thinking it was Julia 's . I leaned over to him and whispered , " You 're really turning me on . " I was a teenager , after all , an expert in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we left our sandals and sneakers on the path with the other shoes , and spread our towels on the sand , facing the ocean . Henry stood a minute looking out , then bounded into the water . The ocean was rough , and as the waves rose you could see clear jellyfish and green popping seaweed . Up where we were , clumps of seaweed had dried almost black in the sun . The wind blew so strong that the seaweed whipped loose and rolled down the beach like tumbleweeds . I looked around us at the people on the beach . A group of women my mother 's age wore bikinis and gold bracelets and were already deeply tanned . The really thin ones looked mean . A small community had set up chairs near our towels . A man was pouring something clear out of a thermos into outstretched plastic glasses , while a woman passed a Baggie of lime wedges . Julia wore a blousy white beach dress and a big straw hat , and slathered herself in sunscreen though she stayed in the shade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You seem to really like your job , " I said . She nodded . Then she asked me if I had any idea what I wanted to do when I grew up . I 'd like to be a great singer , " I said . " Maybe you will , " she said . " I wo n't . " " How do you know ? " " Tone-deaf , " I said . I sat up on my elbows watching Henry in the ocean . The water was just getting warm , and he was the only one in for a while . He waited for his wave in a standstill crawl position , his body facing us , but his head turned back to where the waves formed . Then he swam hard , caught the wave , and rode it all the way in to shore . I loved how he looked the last second of his ride his hair sluiced back , his part zigzagged , his face pure joy . Sometimes he would actually laugh out loud . When he stood up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see without his glasses . I joined him in the ocean . It was cold , but I kept up with him and went under when he did . I stood beside him , and he pulled my arms out in front of me . He 'd been trying to teach me to bodysurf for years . " Now wait for your wave . " He looked behind him . " Swim hard , " he said suddenly . " Now ! " But I missed that wave , and the next one . Then Julia came in . The two of them swam beyond where the waves broke , and I got out . On my towel , I watched them bob with the swell of the wave just forming . Then he dove under . He pointed his hand out of the water , like a shark fin , and went after her . I saw her arms flailing as she was pulled under . The next time I looked up , she was coming toward me . Before she put on her beach dress , I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a black one-piece and was even thinner than I suspected , with smaller breasts than I had . That year , all of a sudden it seemed , there my breasts were , and my mother and I kept having to go to Lord &; Taylor for bigger bras . Boys gave me more attention now , and it made me nervous . My breasts seemed to say something about me that I did n't want said . My Achilles ' heel , they put me in constant danger of humiliation . My theory was that if you had breasts , boys wanted to have sex with you , which was n't exactly a big compliment , since they wanted to have sex anyway . Whereas if you had a beautiful face , like Julia , boys fell in love with you , which seemed to happen almost against their will . Then the sex that you had would be about love . I 'd told my theory to my friend Linda , who wanted to be a social scientist and was always coming up with theories herself . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep . " Guys might think they want a pillow , but they 'll sleep just as well without one . " She 'd said , " Guys will sleep anywhere if they 're really tired . " * * * That night , when Julia got into her bunk , I told her that she could go into Henry 's now if she wanted ; she did n't have to wait for me to fall asleep . I said , " I think I might be older than you think I am . " She stopped , and seemed to be choosing her words . I wanted her to know she did n't have to do this either , but I could n't think how to say it without insulting her . She admitted that she did n't really know anyone my age . " I keep trying to remember what I was like at fourteen , " she said . " Other than books , I think all I cared about was my horse , Cinders . " I pictured her in one of those black velvet hats with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What happened to Cinders ? " " Boys ? " She smiled at me . Then we said good night and she went to my brother 's room . In the middle of the night , on my way to the bathroom , I noticed that his door had blown open . Before I closed it , I saw them in his single bed , sleeping in a loose hug , his arms holding her bare back . * * * A few weekends later , the sky was white and the air moist ; the forecast was rain , but my mother kept looking up at the sky and saying it was sure to clear up . In the afternoon , Julia sat at the table , marking up a manuscript from work . As she finished a page , she passed it to Henry to read . " Come join us , Jane , " she said . I was a little afraid to ; I thought I might reveal that I was n't as smart as Julia might think . But I took the seat next to Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages I read , about a girl whose parents were getting divorced ; it was more real than I would 've expected . When I looked up , my parents were watching the three of us and smiling . I told Julia how much I liked the book and it made her really excited . Mostly she edited children 's books , but she was starting to publish ones for my age group , which she called YA , or young adult . Once my parents were out of earshot , I admitted that I hardly went to the library , and when I did I asked the librarian for books that she felt would be inappropriate for my age . I told Julia that novels for my age group always seemed to be about what your life was supposed to be like , instead of what it was . Same with magazines . " Even the ads are false , " I said . " Like they 'll show a boy picking up a girl for a date with a handful of daisies behind his back . Nobody my age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in my vocabulary . " Julia was so interested that I was tempted to tell her about The House , the abandoned shack by the railroad tracks where kids went to get high and make out . I 'd only gone there once , when a boy I liked casually mentioned that he 'd be there . When I walked in , he said , " Hey . " I smoked a cigarette and tried to act like I belonged there . He came over and sat with me on the ripped sofa . He passed me the bong . I shook my head , and smiled as though I was already really high . Then he leaned over , just as I 'd wanted him to . But he whispered , " Are you horny ? " the opposite of a sweet nothing . * * * They had other places to go Julia had friends in Amagansett and Fire Island and the weekend they went up to Martha 's Vineyard , I brought Linda to the shore . We slept in the lower bunks . When I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked if I thought they had sex in there . I heard my father 's voice coming from my parents ' bedroom and wondered if they could hear me . I whispered , " Can you have sex without making any noise ? " " Who knows ? " she said . I thought of the words Julia used , and imitated her breathing heavily and saying , " Exquisite . Extraordinary . You 're no octogenarian , Hank . " We laughed , but right afterward , trying to fall asleep , I felt terrible . * * * On the beach , Linda became her social-scientist self and said , " At the top of the social hierarchy is the blond man on the elevated white chair . The symbolic throne . " " I believe the common term lifeguard ' signifies his desire to copulate , " I said , " i.e. , to guard the perpetuation of the species . " " Note that he paints his nose white , " she said . " Not unlike the chiefs of many sub-Saharan tribes . " The lifeguard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mating call . " * * * My parents loved Linda . That night , when we said we were going to see the moon on the ocean , they said , " Fine , " in unison , even though it was late . Once we were out the door , I imitated myself saying , " We 're going to rob a liquor store ! " and my parents saying , " Fine ! " On the beach , there was a big crowd sitting around a bonfire , and my fearless friend walked right up and sat down in the circle . I sort of followed her . There was a keg , but when someone asked if we 'd like a beer , Linda said , " I wish we could . " I did n't find out what she 'd meant until a joint was passed to her and she handed it right off to me , saying , " Remember the three Ds from detox : do n't , do n't , do n't . " I passed the joint , as though exerting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashbacks ? " " I think I always will , " I said . " Remember , " she said , " never say always .
