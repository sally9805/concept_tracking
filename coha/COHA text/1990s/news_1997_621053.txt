<p> When sales of Dockers pants began slipping several years ago , the company faced an unsettling irony : The brand that had reached prominence as the default pant for Baby Boomers was losing its edge as its customers approached their middle years . <p> " We were beginning to age , " said James Capon , president of Dockers USA , a division of San Francisco 's Levi Strauss &; Co . " In 1994 we scrambled , frankly , to revive the brand . " <p> Today , Dockers executives and observers say the line has in fact made an impressive turnaround . <p> This year , the Dockers division expects to increase its 25 percent market share in the men 's casual slacks business by as much as 2 percentage points , reversing a long decline , according to executives . <p> And one California specialty store owner who traditionally has sold only jeans said he is planning to make room in his shop this year for Dockers . <p> " The brand is red-hot , " said the retailer , who declined to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth for several years after the brand 's 1986 launch , fueled by men aged 25 to 40 who were seeking a comfortable but dressier alternative to jeans . <p> Dockers advertisements in the 1980s and early 1990s focused on the " business casual " market . They portrayed professional men , either in the office or engaged in traditional " guy " activities such as playing darts or fishing . <p> But after seven years , the formula appeared to falter . <p> In 1993 sales began stalling and in 1994 , they fell for the first time . Dockers ' share in the men 's khakis market at department stores , a key barometer for the line , tumbled to 29 percent in 1994 from 42 percent the previous year . <p> Market research showed that men in their 20s were n't interested in the brand . The Dockers name was losing its appeal even among its target customers , who by then were in their mid-30s to late-40s , as Dockers became indistinguishable from a growing array of casual slacks lines . <p> The first step by Dockers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s to ignore a new , " wrinkle- free " fabric treatment . " We had thought that wrinkle-free was too formal for Dockers , " said Capon . But shoppers flocked to buy apparel that did n't require ironing . <p> By early 1995 , almost all Dockers slacks were made with wrinkle-free fabric . <p> The question of how to position the Dockers image was more difficult . Based on the sheer size of the Baby Boom generation , some company executives wanted to continue marketing to Boomers as they aged . Others called for a trickier strategy of marketing to customers in their mid-20s to early 30s while at the same time trying not to alienate the Boomer core . <p> In the end , those who supported a more youthful orientation prevailed . The result was a new advertising slogan , " Nice Pants , " and a series of slick ads featuring stylish young men and , often , gorgeous young women admiring their khakis . <p> " We wanted to connect emotionally with men who are just starting out , " said Robert Hanson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pants with business , " we focused on the message that these pants allow the expression of each wearer 's individual style . " <p> Fortunately , Baby Boomers seemed to like the ads just as much as younger shoppers . " What helped was that the average 50-year-old man today is younger in his mind than in previous generations , " said Capon . " He identifies with the 30-year-old guy in the commercials . " <p> The ads , created by Foote , Cone &; Belding of San Francisco , also appeal to women , who make up only a small part of the Dockers slacks business , but who have a great deal of influence in men 's clothes-buying decisions , Dockers executives said . <p> In addition to the ads , Dockers in 1995 introduced a line called " Authentics " designed to appeal to younger men and to be worn socially , rather than for work . Authentics come in more stylish cuts and are more similar to jeans in their finishes and detailing than standard Dockers . <p> Today , a surprising 70 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one pair of Dockers , up from 58 percent in 1994 , according to the company . <p> " They could have turned off their current target by going younger  --  that happens , " said Craig Branigan , managing director of Landor Associates , a San Francisco brand consulting firm . " Elasticity of brand varies according to the product and the name . " <p> Branigan cited Walt Disney Co. , a company known for its children 's films , as a brand that failed to broaden its appeal to a new age group . In the early 1980s , Disney hired Landor to create the Touchstone name for its division that makes movies for teenagers , after the Disney name proved unpopular with 14- to 18-year-olds , he said . <p> " Disney is one of the strongest brand names in the world , yet even it had problems stretching to a new age group , " Branigan said . ( Disney declined to comment . ) <p> Youthful ads resonate with Baby Boomers because that generation " is in relatively good health for their age and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Branigan added . <p> Retailers said the Dockers repositioning has made a noticeable difference on the sales floor . <p> Sales of men 's Dockers at Mervyn 's , a department store chain based in Hayward , rose between 10 and 15 percent annually in both 1995 and 1996 , compared to 5 percent or less in 1994 , said Jeff Doshan , senior vice president of merchandising for Mervyn 's , a division of Dayton Hudson . More appealing colors of pants , such as olive and muted blue , and more stylish tops have stoked sales , Doshan said . Dockers represent 80 percent of the men 's casual slacks sold at the 275 Mervyn 's stores . <p> Shirts and complementary colors will play a greater role at Dockers in the future , executives said . <p> At a Dockers store in Sommerset Collection , a mall in Troy , Mich. , the most popular area is a new feature called the Khaki Center , where men can flip through posters showing options for mixing and matching tops and bottoms . <p> Still , the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 75 percent of sales coming from pants , Capon said . " Bottoms are really our strength , " he said . <p> The company plans to open a Dockers shop in San Francisco as soon as it can find good real estate , Capon said . It also plans to convert its nine other Dockers stores to the new format with Khaki Centers . <p> Sales of Dockers in the United States last year reached approximately $ 1 billion , about one-third the size of the Levi 's brand , according to privately held Levi 's . Levi 's also markets a third , much smaller brand : Slates dress pants . <p> Meanwhile , the men 's slacks market continues to grow , driven by increasing acceptance of casual clothing worn at work , said Peter Simon , an analyst at the market research firm NPD Group . <p> This year sales of men 's pants in the United States are projected to rise 9.4 percent to $ 5 billion , compared to only 7.3 percent for total men 's apparel and 5.8 percent for all apparel , Simon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slacks market will grow to 175 million units in 2002 , up from 113 million units last year . <p> Because women have other clothing options such as skirts and tights , the women 's market is much smaller . The women 's casual pants market is expected to rise to 55 million units in 2002 from 46 million last year . Levi 's expects sales of boys ' casual pants to grow to 14 million from 10 million over the same period . <p> Women 's clothing comprises just 14 percent of Dockers sales while boys ' represents 6 percent . The company does not make girls ' clothing . <p> CHART : <p> SELLING KHAKIS Projected growth in the U.S. khaki market , in millions of units : MEN : 1996 : 113 2002 : 175 WOMEN : 1996 : 46 2002 : 55 BOYS : 1996 : 10 2002 : 14 EC :
