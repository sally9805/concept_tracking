On the plane coming back to Louisiana for my father 's funeral , I remembered a story he used to tell when I was a child . It was this : A little girl is crossing over a bridge . There 's a troll under the bridge who does n't like little girls ; any that cross over , he eats them up . But this is a brave little girl ; she 's determined to get over the bridge . So  --  ( at this point I am already tucked into bed , the covers tight at the sides ; I scrunch under the blanket to make sure the troll ca n't get at me )  --  she takes the first step over the bridge . " Who 's that walking on my bridge ? " the troll asks . " It 's only me , " says the little girl . And my father tiptoes with his fingertips across the bed covers so I can see how scared the little girl is . " Who 's that walking across my bridge ? " the troll repeats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little girl , taking a few more tiptoes over the bed . And the troll begins to sway his body back and forth . My father is swaying back and forth ; he loves this story . And the bridge begins to sway with him . By this time my father is putting some weight into it , the whole bed is creaking , swaying back and forth , back and forth . I 've got the covers up to my nose ; only my eyes are out ; I hardly breathe . " WHO 'S THAT WALKING ON MY BRIDGE ? " " It 's only me ! " With this the troll ca n't stand any more . He jumps up , he snaps ! his jaws together  --  my father is snapping his forearms , locked at the elbows  --  he snaps those great jaws and eats the little girl up . Agggahh ! my father roars , and I am in an ecstasy of terror and pleasure . My father would make great gobbling sounds , vampire kisses , and satisfied smacking of the lips . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicacy . I asked for this story every night , and every night , he told it . <p> I thought about that story , coming back on the plane after my father died . It was October and early in the morning . Traveling businessmen ate cold scrambled eggs and drank orange juice with vodka . The one on my right , a widower retired from real estate , kept trying to show me coin tricks . He gave me his card , The Abracadabra Man . He was a magician now , he said  --  did shows at grammar schools . It was a long trip ; I was a thousand miles from home . Auden was right : everything turns away quite leisurely from the disaster . <p> The story I heard when I got home was that my parents had been playing golf , the way they had every Sunday for the last twenty years . Later that day , they were to have had friends over for bridge , two tables . But this fall Sunday , on the back nine , shortly after my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then sank a seven-foot putt for a bogie , he returned his club to the back of the cart , complained of his left arm , and said he thought he 'd better go home now . It was n't a crisis , he explained , but he was very tired and wanted to go home . A few minutes after that , he was dead . <p> My mother drove him back to the pro shop , holding his body against hers , jouncing the cart over roughs , cutting across fairways and even the practice greens . Somebody rounded up a doctor in the clubhouse , a young obstetrician who tried to give my mother a Valium that she would n't take . She stood there in the pro shop , surrounded by people and racks of knit shirts and displays of putters ; and when she was finally able to say something , the doctor could hardly understand her . But I could have told him what she 'd say : " Will someone call my daughter , please . " <p> My father was a man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman in his life . I lost a good deal of my advantage as I got older ; you ca n't tickle the feet of a thirteen-year-old and throw her down , giggling , on the bed . And I grew up to be not at all what he wanted : a gawky , thin-faced kid , dark , unhappy , using time unwisely , given to evasions and deceit . I lied continually , a habit my mother called , with varying degrees of irony , a wonderful imagination . I was a movie star , a poet , a rogue , a racehorse : I was anything but myself . My parents could n't figure it out . They had put in time , love , good schools , vitamins . They went to the PTA and supervised my choice of friends . Nothing took : and in spite of my father 's stories , I wanted out . It was the 1960s , a brand-new decade , and the world I had grown up in was changing like a kaleidoscope . I wanted to get a look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas : " Do n't get married right away , " she said . " Work for a while . Learn to be on your own . Support yourself . " She herself had never taken that advice . Married at twenty-one , she had gone straight from her father 's house to her husband 's , one man to another . My father was seventeen years older than she . He was a gardener ; she was his flower . She never had a job , never owned a checkbook , never paid a bill or took a trip by herself . <p> But what she did , what he encouraged her to do , she did well . She was a golfer : city champion . She was a fundraiser : a new church wing went up . When she quit smoking , I thought she was going to make the whole world quit . She bought a film , one in Twenty Thousand . She bought a projector , a screen . The movie opens with a nice guy , an ordinary guy , strolling down the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , and you 're watching him being cut open . Where she got that stuff , a medical school , wherever , I never asked . And remember , this was 1955 nine years before the Surgeon General 's warning . The knife goes down the smooth hairless chest , I can see it , the thin line of blood following , at a second 's lapse , the surgeon 's hand . Cut to gloved fingers , stainless steel : they spread back the ribs , expose the gray , necrotic , breathing lung . The masks , the sounds of labored breath . I smell the anesthetic , I hear the kids in the room squirming . Because my mother took this film to my junior high school , every junior high in the city . Kids watched it , they dropped like flies , especially the jocks . Teachers hustled them out , green themselves . Mama had people over and showed it in our living room , with cookies and Coca-Cola . Neighbors , church members , business friends of my father 's , came and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my home town , in my circle of friends , just about nobody smokes . Middle-aged men still come up to me and tell how my mother scared hell out of them when they were twelve . <p> The press loved her . We must have four scrapbooks , five , filled with clippings : Mama making her hole-in-one , Mama winning State , Mama refusing to let the electric company mutilate our street 's trees , Mama taking a deep breath . She 's got this big toothy smile and a poster tan ; she looks like a lady who plays dirty if she has to . She 's also got these big double-dipper breasts ( they got in the way of her backswing , she said ) and legs that did n't stop : it was no fun having boys come home from college and watching them fall all over themselves-for Mama . Was I jealous ? Sure I was . But mostly I wanted some of that zip for myself . <p> Somehow  --  and chiefly by accident , but that 's another story  --  after graduation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Florida . It was the jumping-off place for the world , the Cape : Grissom and Glenn , Saturn and Mercury , Atlas , Titan , the original Seven . And I was there , a reporter , albeit the lowest , the worst-paid , the most questionably qualified , impatiently tolerated , and condescended-to reporter on the staff of Today . The education staffer in a town obsessed with space . ( " What 's an IQ ? " my editor asked . " A number , " I said . He liked that , and I had the job . ) He thought I had the stuff , and I had to believe him : it was my life he was talking about . He was the editor of the best weekly paper in the United States : Time , that unimpeachable source , had said so . It was a good place to be in the Sixties , and I had fallen into it . And it was one thousand miles from home . <p> This ca n't be good , Daddy said . <p> Go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their house , the sun glinted off the gravel in the driveway ; I sat in my new blue Falcon , the back seat full of clothes , books , Joan Baez albums . My father , skill in his robe and needing a shave , stood in the driveway beside the car . He kept cleaning his already-spotless glasses with a paper towel , standing in one spot and not saying much . Mama kept asking , " Are you sure you have n't forgotten anything ? " and " Promise you wo n't drive if you feel tired . Call us as soon as you stop tonight . " <p> " Call collect . " My father gave me four fifties , which , added to what he had already given me for the trip , amounted to more than my first month 's salary . <p> " I do n't need this much . " <p> " She 's right , " Mama said . " Let her manage . She 'll call us if she needs anything . You think she 's going to forget the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " You never know what might happen . " <p> I put the fifties in my purse . <p> " I do n't want you breaking down on the highway , " he said , although he had bought my car new expressly to prevent that . <p> I leaned my cheek against my father 's and felt the early morning stubble . It surprised me , that , and the fact that I was nearly as tall as he . <p> Mama remembered something and zoomed back inside the house . <p> " I 've got to go , " I said . I wanted to make five hundred miles a day and it was already a half-hour past sunrise . <p> Mama reached in the car and put six  --  six !  --  bananas and two peaches in a plastic bag on the front seat . " Do n't forget to call , " she said , holding my father 's hand . <p> " All right . All right ! " From the end of the driveway I shouted , " I 'll call you tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headed for highways south and southeast . The prospect of being paid to write stretched in front of me like the miles ; I had wanted to be a writer since fourth-grade Mrs. Weeks had read my essays aloud to the sixth-grade class . The sun was at the corner of Letitia and Belmont Streets ; by the time it set I would be in Tallahassee . Mississippi , Alabama , and Georgia rolled past ; the Gulf coast , with its trees all bent in from the ocean ; then the red dirt hills . All of it seemed clean , autumnal , new as print . I rolled down the windows of the Falcon and sang along with the radio , loud as I could . The songs stayed the same while the announcers ' accents flattened out . By the time I got to Florida 's Route A1A , all my bananas were gone . <p> When I arrived at Merritt Island , I drove straight through town to an isolated part of the beach . I climbed over the dunes that separated A1A from the ocean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the black ribbons of seaweed strung at the high-tide line . I squinted ; the wind that always blows in from the Atlantic was blowing for the first time in my face . The wind smelled like ocean . I took off my loafers and socks and walked out on the hard coarse surface of the wet sand . To my left , the gantries of Cape Kennedy blurred in the humidity ; right , the beach trailed and shimmered like a long white scarf . A foolish wave , colder than I expected , rolled to my feet , paused , and retreated . Sandpipers chased the foam , peeping and searching for food . They left , I noticed , three-pointed tracks , like stars with the bottoms cut off . <p> " Ponce de Leon ! " I hollered to the gulls . " Balboa ! " <p> My river-bound Louisiana soul unbuckled like the waves . I splashed into the Atlantic , not even rolling up my double-knits . I was twenty-one ; I had a job on the best weekly paper in the country ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks . <p> And then my father died . <p> A few days after the funeral , when it was time to reopen the store for business , Mr. Brant , our office manager , called from the U-Tote-M across the street . <p> " Would you try to find your father 's keys to the store ? " he asked me . " I hate to bother you , you know ? But we ca n't get in the back warehouse . " <p> " What ? " Mama came to the phone , assuming it was for her . " The keys ? " She had deep circles around her eyes , like bruises . " Where would they be ? The keys , the keys . . . " <p> My aunt Adele was making coffee in the kitchen and she said to me , " What about the pants your father was wearing ? " <p> Mrs. Morgan , our next-door neighbor , said , " Would n't you think those people would take care of that and not bother Virginia ? " <p> " There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A paper sack with things in it . " <p> " Well , there , " Adele said . <p> Mama and I found the keys in the sack , drove over , and opened the back warehouse . I 'm not sure my mother had ever been inside ; I 'm sure I had n't . It was crammed with merchandise : Italian cane-back chairs , mattresses , Sealy , Beautyrest , Medi-Right . Tables , credenzas , breakfronts ; Trouvailles , Sligh , Baker . Hotpoint appliances , Zenith electronics . Most of it was n't unpacked ; it was still in crates or vinyl wrappings . Here was thousands of dollars worth of merchandise , most of it not paid for , though we did n't know that yet . Mr. Brant flicked on the switch with his knuckle and thanked us for coming over . He was a smiling man , a good salesman who remembered people 's names . My father had liked him . But today Mr. Brant looked like a man who was afraid he was going to lose his job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. V. , " he said . " We 've got the inventory . We 're going to keep everything shipshape , just like Mr. V. would have wanted . " <p> " I know you will , " Mama said . " We appreciate that , Mr. grant . " <p> " Do you "  --  Mr. Brant looked somewhat embarrassed  --  " want to let us know what to do about the safe ? " <p> " What 's wrong with it ? " <p> " Ca n't open it , Mrs. V. Do n't have the combination . " <p> And my mother , who could drive a wood off the men 's tee with the best golfers in the club , who could put a wing on the Children 's Hospital practically single-handed , did n't even know the combination to my father 's safe . <p> " Sell the business , " my aunt advised , who was dying to know how much my father had left us and eager to offer consolation provided the amount was not too much . " Sell ! You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sure what I 'm going to do , " Mama said . " I think Stella and I could handle it . " <p> " You 've got inflation , " Adele said . " You 've got bills . You 've got long hours . You 've got no-good salesmen . " She recited woe like a Greek chorus . " What do you know about sales ? What do you know about accounting ? What do you know , Virginia ? " <p> " I do n't know anything , " my mother admitted . " But I know I do n't want to talk about all this right now . " <p> That week people came over , day after day , night after night . Adele , my uncle Peter , their kids , Joyce and Petey . Also the couples my parents had played bridge with for twenty years . Also neighbors . They ate food that they brought and they talked to my mother , trying to cheer her up or at least distract her . To a certain extent , it worked  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left and my mother and I were alone in the house . She let in Lady , the dog , who had always slept outside . Lady curled up at the foot of Mama 's bed as though she had slept there every night of her life . <p> " You know something ? " Mama said , standing there in her pink bathrobe , brushing her teeth . " I 've always shared a room . My sister and I slept together until I got married . Then Arthur . I 've never slept by myself . I 'm afraid I ca n't . " <p> She had certainly slept alone  --  my father had traveled to the furniture markets twice a year-but it was n't the time to remind her . Instead I pulled on my nightgown and climbed into my parents ' double bed , on the side where my father had slept less than a week before . I piled the pillows together and leaned back against the headboard while she stayed in the bathroom , brushing . <p> " When are you going back ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd stay a week . " She did n't say anything right away so I added , " I can stay longer if you need me . I told them at least a week . " <p> " That 's good , " she said . " I 'm glad of that . " She came back in the bedroom and said , " Tell me what it 's like . The people you work with . " She unscrewed a jar of Eterna 27 and smoothed it around her eyes with delicate upward sweeps of her middle finger . <p> " They 're OK . We work all the time , seven o'clock every night . Sometimes later . Last Friday I was at the office until two in the morning . " <p> " Why so late ? " <p> " It takes me twice as long as anybody else . But I 'm catching on . " <p> Mama made an ambiguous hmm through closed lips , possibly disapproving my tardiness , possibly incredulous that I was n't already surpassing all others . <p> " They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . " <p> " Let me tell you something . Your father was sending you money , twice . He gave it to me , to send to you . You did n't get it because I did n't send it . That was my idea , to let you live on your salary , but I did n't tell him  --  he wanted you to have more . " She was n't apologizing , just setting forth facts . " I should have sent it . " <p> " I did n't need it . I do n't want it . " <p> " I know , but your father wanted you to have it . " She looked at me in a way that signaled the end of the subject . " Did you know that when I went to tournaments , he 'd pack my bags ? " <p> " No , I did n't . " <p> " To make sure I had n't forgotten anything . Even my clubs . " <p> " Would you have forgotten them ? " <p> " Maybe . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come off . " Who knows ? " <p> They had been happy ; when I was growing up , I thought all married people were happy.They had loved to go out.Mama would step out of the bath , fragrant and wet ; she 'd open the bathroom door to let out the steam . Her skin was tanned darker than her hair , and the white outline of her golf shorts and shirt made her seem twice vulnerable . <p> The dress she would wear hung in the closet . Her evening clothes cost hundreds of dollars , even in the Fifties , but my father loved the way she dressed . She would be fastening her merry widow and he would offer to help with all the little hooks . Then he 'd slip his hands inside the cups . I , trespassing , was all eyes . Mama bounced away : " You 'd better watch it , " she said . " I love to watch it , " he answered . She laughed ; then he went off looking for his studs , looking tickled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , teak-colored , and fragrant , and she and my father had left for their dance , I locked the door against the baby-sitter and stepped into a green satin dress Mama had decided against wearing . I pulled up the neckline  --  it flapped against my ten-year-old chest like a lowered mainsail  --  and hitched up the top with a safety pin . I hung my mother 's pearls around my neck , dangled rhinestones from my ears . Then I dotted on enough perfume to drive the cat under the bed . I found my mother 's green slippers , stiletto-heeled , and flopped over to the full-length mirror to admire . <p> Then the baby-sitter knocked on the door . " Time to go to bed , " she said . <p> On the Friday before I was going to leave , my aunt Adele came into my room while I was writing a letter . She closed the door and began talking in a low voice . My mother was on the other side of the house , in the kitchen . <p> Stella , " Adele @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good idea for you to leave . Not right now . " <p> " You mean stay another week. ? " <p> " No . Another six months . Maybe a year . " <p> The suggestion seemed so impossible that I just stared at her for a minute . <p> " Virginia 's scared to death , " she continued , " but do n't expect her to admit it . " <p> " I ca n't stay that long . I have a job . They expect me to come back . " <p> " They 'd certainly understand if you did n't . " <p> " They would , but I could n't get that kind of job here . " <p> " Does that matter so much ? " <p> " It matters a lot . " <p> " More than your mother ? " <p> " Of course not ! " I said , but Adele was n't going to be interrupted . <p> " If you stayed with her for a while-who 's saying forever ?  --  she 'd adjust better . And you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They would n't keep it open six months . " <p> " Have you asked them ? " <p> She knew , of course , in the way that people who ask rhetorical questions always know , that I had n't . <p> Adele put her hand on my shoulder and regarded me with expectation . <p> " Your mother 's deceptive , " she said . " She looks like she can do anything . But when it comes to the real business of the world-she does n't know a damned thing . You 've had four years of college , a job-you could help her right now , and she needs you . Do n't you know that ? " <p> " No , " I answered . " And I think you 're wrong about what she can do . " <p> " Then you 'd better think again about it . " <p> After she closed the door I stared at the letter I had been writing until I could no longer see it . That my aunt was a meddling guilt-monger , serving it right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt . She would have cheerfully admitted it herself . But that she could also be right ! - and this was where the nerve met the burn-that was unthinkable . I think I hated Adele at that moment . She had seen the way I looked ; she must have known how I felt . And she expected to win ; her last shot was , " You see ? You know the right thing to do . " The tears in my eyes were her claim to victory . I could n't answer her-I do n't think I could answer even now . But I knew one thing : on Monday I was going back to work . <p> Saturday morning , five people were in the house . Adele and Mrs. Morgan were in the den watching a rerun of Garden Time  --  how to grow ageratum , begonias , petunias , and shamrocks from seed . In their Sears-bright slacks and sweater sets , they looked like petunias gone to seed themselves . Claire , our old housekeeper who had retired when her arthritis got too bad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodes , gripped the handles of an Electrolux . The monotonous whir of the vacuum held its own with Garden Time . In the kitchen I was watching my mother fix lunch . She was slicing purple onions for a salad . <p> " Want some help ? " I asked . <p> " How about a glass of sherry ? You two want some sherry ? " she called into the den . <p> " We 'll get it . " <p> " Sit tight , " Mama commanded . " Stella will bring it . " <p> In the refrigerator were remnants of quiche and a ham casserole left over from the wake , also two bottles of Harvey's. one bottle was almost empty , so I took both out . <p> " You drank all this ? " I asked my mother . <p> " Last night , so I could sleep . open the other . " <p> " The doctor advised it , instead of sleeping pills , " Adele called from the den . <p> " Well , that 's too much , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the den , where a woman in high heels was showing the home gardener how to transplant seedlings that have been sprouted in egg cartons . " I ca n't hear the program in the kitchen , " I told Adele . " Mind if I turn it up ? " That fixed the eavesdropping . <p> " Take it easy , " I told my mother back in the kitchen . <p> " I ca n't sleep . I 'll pour it myself if it worries you so much . " <p> " I 'm not worried . " <p> " I just ca n't sleep , is all . " <p> I knew that : all night I could feel her throwing back the covers , covering up again ; I heard her crying . I was n't sleeping either ; twice the night before I had been wakened by a dream : I was back in Cocoa Beach , on the island , a narrow spit of land two blocks wide between mainland and ocean . A storm approached , black cumulus clouds rolling in from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in one of the island 's vacation houses . All the houses were on tilts . Rain began to fall  --  there was real rain outside , driving against the window  --  and water began to rise on the island . It covered the beach , the dunes , the highway . By the time I realized I needed to leave , it was too late : the bridge was down . The second time I woke up , I went downstairs in the dark , my bare feet freezing on the linoleum . I sat at the kitchen table , unable to stop crying or to shake off the dream . I wanted to tell Mama . Finally I went back to bed , and just before dawn , I fell asleep . <p> " What are we having ? " I asked her now . <p> I lifted the lid of one of the pots on the stove . Inside were pole beans , lying on top of the collapsible steel colander that she steamed them in . ' I upended the lid like a shield to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can turn that off , " Mama said . " They 're ready . " <p> I poured Bristol Cream into two stemmed glasses and set one on the counter beside my mother . She had finished with the purple onions and now she was tearing spinach leaves from their stems . Her hands moved quickly , and her work produced a moist and rhythmic sound . Her back was toward me , her head inclined slightly forward . She was standing , it seemed to me , as she had stood for the last twenty years , fixing oatmeal or coffee or the vegetables that she bought early in the mornings from the old man who used to peddle produce from a three-wheeled bicycle cart . He 'd come down the street ringing his bell , often during breakfast ; my mother and I would stop in the middle of oatmeal and rush out before he passed our house . The fruits and vegetables rested in slatted wooden crates on the bed of the cart . Mama showed me how to select pole beans ; mottled or solid green , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that way they cook evenly . Get them small , about one-quarter-inch diameter ; they 're younger , tenderer . She 'd snap one : I reamed to listen for the pop . I learned how to look at things from my mother . <p> " Richard thinks we should incorporate , " she was saying in a voice beneath the television 's cover . Her hands methodically tore the spinach leaves . " He thinks we could find a good manager . Maybe Mr. Brant would work out . " <p> " Sure he would . But Mama , you do n't need a lawyer to tell you that . " <p> " You think . " She looked up . " You think . " <p> " If you can organize the women 's golf association , you can run a business . " <p> " Is n't that a little naive ? " Her voice when she spoke was flat . " I never walked in that office except to draw out money . " She shook her head . " And these success stories . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young women . I 'm forty-nine years old . " She seemed to have finished , then added , " one thing , Richard 's right . We should incorporate . To protect us against debts . " <p> " We have debts ? " <p> " Yes , some . Not big ones . Not too big . The insurance . . . it 's . . . I do n't know what all these papers mean ! What to sign , what to keep  --  " She loosed an audible breath across the kitchen . " You ought to look at them before you leave . I 'll ask Richard to hurry it up . Could you stay for that ? " <p> " Monday . Could we do it Monday ? " <p> " I 'll call and ask . " <p> She finished with the spinach and tossed the salad in its mahogany bowl , the dark wrinkled leaves green against the purple onions . " There , " seine said , turning around to face me . " Does n't that look good ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers were n't ready until Wednesday afternoon . When my mother and I drove back from the attorney 's office , my bags were in the back seat . We drove past supermarkets , past shopping centers with parking lots like gray lakes , out of the city , toward the airport . It was humidly cold , and the tires rotated against the pavement with a monotonous , heartlike beat . Mama leaned toward the steering wheel . <p> " I think Richard is overcharging us , " she said . " Did you see the bill he gave me ? " Without taking her eyes off the road , she rummaged in her purse and gave me a cleanly typed sheet with an engraved letterhead . " He 's so afraid he wo n't get his money , he did n't even wait to mail it to me . " <p> " Legal services , " I read out loud . " $650 . " I looked up .

What do you want me to do ? " Her voice dropped , a sure sign that she was angry . " How much did your father ever tell me ? Stella , I ca n't do all this by myself ! " <p> " Maybe I can do something . " <p> She rammed the bill back into her purse . " It 's pretty hard to do anything when you 're five states away . " <p> There we were . <p> She concentrated , frowning , on her driving , and stared at the painted stripes on the highway . I listened to the tires thump the cracks in the pavement . It was a long drive to the airport . <p> When she and I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his buying trips , Mama had always taken his leaving hard , no matter how many times he had gone before , no matter if the trip lasted only a week . We 'd all wait for the train , Daddy looking good in a Burberry coat bought especially for the trip . It would be cold , but none of us wanted to wait inside the tobacco-dense depot . My parents stood on the platform holding hands while I sat on my father 's Samsonite two-suiter or jumped up to ask , " How many minutes now ? " Mama , every time , gave me the answer . When the train pulled up , all black steel and vibrations , massive loud threatening metal , my father embraced my mother , holding her head in his big hands , his fingers in her pale hair . Then he reached down and lifted me so that we were all eye to eye . <p> " Mind your mother , " he said , " and I 'll bring you something from Chicago . " <p> " What ?

" Her tears left a spot on the lapel of his new coat . <p> The memory caught me like the sight of his razor in the bathroom . <p> The airport waiting room was overheated . outside , wind swept up occasional flurries of rain . The airplane attendants wore yellow slickers that were reflected in the tarmac 's shine . In Cocoa Beach people would be walking the beaches in their bathing suits , but here , in this room , it was winter . <p> " I 'm thinking , " Mama said as we took adjoining seats , " that maybe I ought to rent out the house . Get an apartment . " <p> " An apartment ? Where ? " <p> " Where Crissy Owens lives , maybe ? She told me there 's one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that ? " I did n't like to think of my mother without trees and a gravel driveway out front . <p> " Who says I would n't ? I 'd be fine . " <p> " What about our furniture ? " <p> " Sell it . or store it . I do n't need such a big place . " <p> " Who would you rent to ? " <p> " I 'd find somebody good . It would be income . " She smiled in a way meant to be reassuring . " Not that we have to worry so much . " I half expected her to reach in her purse and pull out a half-dozen bananas . <p> " No , " she repeated . " We do n't have to worry so much . " <p> " I 'm not worried . " The loudspeaker announced my flight , first call . " I just do n't think you should rush into anything . Richard said not to rush into anything . " <p> People rose from their seats and scooped up packages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sneakers , caught in the viselike grips of their mothers ; businessmen with leather envelopes ; old ladies in mink stoles . Neither my mother nor I moved . <p> " I 'll be back before Christmas , " I said . " We can talk about it then , if you want . " <p> " I 'm not sure I want to wait until Christmas . " <p> " Then I 'll call as soon as I get home . " <p> Home . <p> I tilted my head to kiss my mother ; then I leaned down and hugged her . Did I feel my mother tremble ? More likely it was myself . <p> The other passengers disappeared into the plane . Up close , my mother 's perfume surrounded me like the green memory of a dress . <p> " Mama , " I said as the stewardess waited for the ticket , " you know I want to stay , do n't you ? " <p> " Oh , Stella . Ca n't you come back ? Go , and come back ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I knew that whatever I said , it would n't be right . <p> " I 'll call you when I get there , " I repeated finally . " You 'll be OK <p> Mama , I know you will . " <p> She gave me a look that said it : I do n't know . <p> She did n't know . <p> <p> By Jacqueline Simon <p>
