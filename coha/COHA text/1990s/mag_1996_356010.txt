It takes starry optimism to see the settling of the eastern Montana drylands primarily as a romance rather than , say , a swindle or a blunder . And starry optimism is what settling this magnificent emptiness required in the first place , as Jonathan Raban relates in his beautifully told historical meditation , Bad Land : An American Romance ( Pantheon ; 336 pages ; $25 ) . <P> Long and dusty experience has shown that several thousand acres is the minimum necessary to make farming pay in this semiarid region . But when homesteading began here just after the turn of the century , 320 acres was thought to be a bountiful sufficiency . Or so the railroads ' seductive brochures enthusiastically proclaimed . To ambitious city dwellers in Boston and Albany , and London and Cracow , it all made glorious sense . The 320 acres of government land were there for the taking , free to anyone enterprising enough to pay a $22 filing fee and build fences . Hard work would turn a clerk into a landowning patriarch . <P> And for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prosperity seemed possible . But the winter of 1916-17 was arctic , and the next summer saw only 5 in. of rain . Crops and credit dried up , farmsteads failed . Even today a curious visitor has no trouble finding the husks of homesteaders ' abandoned houses , some with clothes still in closets and perhaps a hopeless account book yellowing on a kitchen floor . <P> Raban , an English travel writer resettled in the U.S. , is a good and shrewd observer . He sees the origins of today 's political attitudes  --  the Westerners ' reflexive contempt for environmentalism and genial hatred of the Federal Government  --  in the homesteaders ' ordeal by hailstorm and bankruptcy . But what makes Bad Land exceptional , on a level with William Least Heat-Moon 's Blue Highways and PrairyErth , is a pervasive sense of yearning . The author is powerfully drawn to this hard country , this broad and nearly featureless landscape , and the reader does not doubt that had Raban been born in 1880 , he would have found himself in Montana by 1908 , driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopefully for rain . <P>  --  By John Skow
