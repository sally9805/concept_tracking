<p> Losing your job flips your life upside down . Here 's how some Atlantans are trying to cope - and how you can , too . <p> Out of work : It 's not end of the world <p> This year , Donna Martin 's 16-year-old daughter bought her own school clothes and paid for them with baby-sitting money . <p> The Martins hang together like that , which is the good news . <p> The bad news is that hanging together has become a survival skill for the Jonesboro family , ever since Ms. Martin , 47 , was laid off from the administrative job she had held for more than 14 years . <p> " I 'm a single parent , with no other kind of income , " said Ms. Martin . " When I walked out , I felt my whole world had completely come apart . " <p> She 's not the only one with that unemployed , unglued feeling . In the most recent weekly report , 414,000 Americans filed their first unemployment claims . <p> In all , 7.6 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number so high that it has become an essential part of the national political debate . The last pre-election unemployment report comes out Friday , and you can bet that political animals of all stripes will be primed to howl about its significance . <p> But for individuals like Ms. Martin , the meaning of unemployment is not a matter of economic theory or political promises . It is immediate and frightening . <p> Getting laid off flattens the bank book and , more often than not , the ego . It strains families . It forces people to search for work , sometimes desperately , in a marketplace that does n't seem to need any more workers . <p> How do you cope with all that ? Experts say there are lots of ways . <p> The pain of it all <p> Number 1 : Do n't panic . <p> Psychologist Douglas Slavin said people must realize that losing a job is traumatic , but it 's not a genuine catastrophe . <p> " It 's not terrible ; it 's not dangerous , " he said from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own resources to understand how you have dealt with problems in the past , to reassure yourself that you have the strength and the capacity to get through it . " <p> Michael Bland , a 34-year-old printer from Decatur , went through that process shortly after he was laid off Aug. 24 . <p> For emotional strength , he depended on prayer and his girlfriend . Then he tallied his job skills and , despite bouts of depression , began his search . <p> " There are n't that many jobs out there , " he said . " But if a person will take two seconds to listen to me , I can sell myself and make them want to hire me . " <p> A crucial point , added Dr. Slavin , is to accept that the symptoms of stress - including irritability , mood swings , stomach upsets , sleep disorders and confusion - are normal and nothing to be afraid of . <p> But with a prolonged period of unemployment , such symptoms are hard to overcome , said Jacqualine Jones , a 38-year-old divorced mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April 1991 . <p> " I feel like I 'm lost in a forest , " said the Decatur woman . " And I do n't know when I 'm going to get rescued . When you 're unemployed , you have no control over your life . Sometimes I do n't have a clue what I 'm going to do from day to day . " <p> When problems overwhelm people , Dr. Slavin observed , " women get depressed , and men go drinking . " <p> The key defense , he added , is " not to define yourself as helpless , but to keep active and feel a sense of control over your life . That means actively defining your new job as finding a job , and structuring your day that way . You get up on time , or early . You check out the want ads , talk to friends and job leads . " <p> Ms. Martin , the Jonesboro woman , said she sometimes wants to shut herself off from the world , but she responds by calling on a friend and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We go out looking for a job together , " she said . " I say , ' If nothing else comes out of this , at least we 're out , we 're together and we 're enjoying each other 's company . ' " <p> Handling the money crunch <p> Squeeze every nickel . <p> Experts say the first step is to draw up a rigorous budget , ranking every item as critical , flexible or frivolous . <p> You 'll have to find ways to pay for critical things , such as rent or mortgage payments , utilities , insurance and perhaps car payments . And you should quit spending for frivolous items , including non-essentials like eating out and , most of all , gift-giving . <p> The flexible items - things like food , clothing and entertainment - are where you can do the most creative cutting . Most households could get by without highly processed and relatively expensive foodstuffs , for example , and just about everybody can forgo brand-name clothing . <p> Some entertainment spending may be a good idea , since life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself a break . But look for cheaper amusements , perhaps dollar movie houses instead of first-run ones . <p> In extreme cases , the cost-cutting can be equally extreme . <p> Ms. Jones , who supports her three children solely from her income as a part-time store cashier , budgets for one pair of pantyhose every two weeks , praying that they wo n't run for that period . She sorts her laundry to decide which clothes to wash at the laundromat and which to do by hand - when she has the detergent to do them . <p> Most workers are eligible for unemployment benefits , and everybody should apply for them as soon as possible . The maximum benefit is $ 185 a week . <p> That 's enough to help with food or rent , or perhaps with health insurance , an item that most people would consider a necessity and any laid-off person needs to come to terms with . Most employers are required to continue group health-care coverage for former employees , if the individual pays the full premiums . <p> One other important way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until you can get another job . Many will work something out . <p> Moving along <p> Experts say job seekers should maintain a daily work schedule , putting eight hours or more a day into the search . The process includes all the usual routines of the work day , things like listing all the tasks to be done , assigning priorities to them and setting deadlines for finishing . <p> It also includes dressing for success . <p> V. Joseph Shipman , a 54-year-old Atlantan who spent more than a year searching for a new job , wore a tie every day of his quest . <p> " I did it because it made me feel good about myself and I was ready to go just in case there was an interview , " he said . <p> He followed another of the basic rules : keep your chin up in a job interview . " If you ca n't sell yourself on yourself , you ca n't sell yourself to anybody else , " he said . <p> As always , the best way to find satisfactory work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " One thing people keep missing the boat on is networking . The real job market is word-of-mouth , " said Jeffrey J. Mayer , author of " Find the Job You 've Always Wanted in Half the Time . " <p> Just such a web of contacts is what brought 3,000 people out to apply for 20 Ford Motor Co. assembly line jobs two weeks ago ; the jobs were advertised solely by telling current employees about them . <p> Rethinking goals <p> Many experts also suggest using sudden unemployment as an opportunity to rethink career goals . <p> " It 's a time for stock-taking , " said John D. Hogan , dean of Georgia State University 's College of Business Administration . " I mean inventory- ing your own talents and the kinds of ways you 'd like to make a living if you had a license to dream . " <p> Finally , Dr. Hogan offered an encouraging reflection to laid-off job seekers : Times are so bad that lots of good people have been pushed out of their old jobs . <p> Employers know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it against applicants . <p> " Given good references , the hiring of such a person tends not to have the kind of stigma it once did , " he said .
