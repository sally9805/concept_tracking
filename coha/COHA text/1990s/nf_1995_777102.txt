The White Man 's Burden // The Collapse of Liberal Hope // The world is white no longer , and it will never be white again . // - James Baldwin(1) // A generation after the civil rights movement , Americans are once again engaged in a radical rethinking of their attitudes toward race , and major changes in public policy are imminent . The choice is whether to preserve the existing structure of race-based policies or opt for a completely different approach . The moment of decision can not be avoided : not to choose is to decide in favor of the status quo and to perpetuate current problems . Yet before adopting a course that will determine the future of race relations into the twenty-first century , Americans must step back from the sound and fury long enough to ask some fundamental questions about race and racism . // The public mood is not conducive to such prudent statesmanship . Indeed the crisis of American race relations is evident from the volatile combination of confusion and anger that characterizes the public debate . Both sentiments arise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blacks . Many whites have become increasingly scornful of black demands , and vehemently reject racial preferences . Most blacks , by contrast , support affirmative action as indispensable to fighting the enduring effects of white racism . On other racial issues as well , from the Los Angeles riots to the OJ . Simpson case , blacks and whites seem to view each other across a hostile divide . There is a political chasm as well : increasingly the Republican party is becoming the party of whites , while the Democratic party is beholden to its African American voting base . If these political and racial divisions are exacerbated , we are likely to witness a further decomposition of the bonds that hold the country together . Thus America 's historically unprecedented attempt to construct a truly multiracial society may be doomed to fail . // This book is an attempt to explain and reconcile the perception gap between whites and blacks by resolving what appears to be the fundamental issue in dispute : is America a racist society ? Deeply distressed by the continuing failure of blacks as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social activists allege that all talk of racial progress is an evasion or a mirage . They assume that racism is not a departure from American ideals but a true expression of them , that the nation 's institutions are ineradicably tainted by racism , and that racism may be an intrinsic part of the human or at least the Western psyche , so that we may never be able to transcend it . The dominant view today is that race is a social reality or , as African American scholar Cornel West puts it , " race matters " ; therefore the only viable response is to institutionalize race as the basis of public policy . In the face of such pessimism , this book advances the view that Cornel West is wrong , that racism can be overcome , and that a serious attempt to do so must first involve revising our most basic assumptions about race . Specifically , I question and reject the following widely shared premises that shape the conventional wisdom about racism , as well as America 's civil rights laws . // * Racism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fear . // * Slavery was a racist institution , and the Constitution 's compromise with slavery discredits the American founding as racist and morally corrupt . // * Segregation was a system established by white racists for the purpose of oppressing blacks . // * In American history , racism is the theory and discrimination is the practice . // * The civil rights movement represented a triumph of justice and enlightenment over the forces of Southern racism and hate . // * Although Martin Luther King , Jr . helped to secure formal rights for blacks , white racism has become more subtle and continues its baleful influence through institutional structures . // * The civil rights leadership is committed to fighting racism and building up the economic and cultural strengths of blacks , especially the poorest ones . // * Affirmative action is a policy that assures equal opportunity for disadvantaged African Americans and other minorities . // * Multiculturalism unites blacks and nonwhite immigrants in a common struggle against white racism . // * Blacks and other persons of color can not be racist because racism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Racism is the main obstacle facing African Americans today , and the primary explanation for black problems . // Black Rage // The three main features of the nation 's racial crisis are the phenomena of black rage , white backlash , and liberal despair . // In 1992 , a white congressional aide working for Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama was accosted at his home in Washington , D.C. , and shot to death . A few weeks later , Edward Evans , a young black man , was arrested . Two friends of Evans testified that they saw him shoot the young staffer . One of them said that Evans harbored strong antiwhite sentiments and promised he was going to kill a white man . The material evidence against Evans , presented at trial , seemed overwhelming . Yet although eleven jurors including five blacks , initially agreed that Evans was guilty of murder , one African American woman , Velma McNeil , refused to convict . A frustrated white jury foreman claimed to the judge that " one juror " was simply unwilling to give credence to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , during jury deliberations , McNeil told fellow jurors that the exoneration of Los Angeles police officers who beat black motorist Rodney King showed the systematic bias of the judicial system against blacks . Juror McNeil denied that her refusal to find the defendant guilty was based on race , pointing instead to possible contradictions in the statements given by the two eyewitnesses . The consequence was a hung jury , and the judge was forced to declare a mistrial . A Washington Post photograph shows McNeil emerging from the courtroom , smiling , chatting , and embracing a relative of the accused. ( 2 ) // If juror McNeil 's reluctance to convict a fellow African American was at least in part motivated by race , the incident is striking in that it reveals two paradigmatic cases of black rage : a poor black man , consumed with racial resentment , seeking to vent his hostility on a white man ; and a middle-class black woman , perhaps equally alienated from society , using the system to settle a score against whites as a group . Black rage is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial , where the defense seems to seek to capitalize on the antagonism of black jurors toward white policemen in order to win a hung jury or an acquittal . Both cases point to the justice system 's vulnerability to racial politics . This is hardly a new problem : during the first half of this century in the segregated South , blacks were routinely victimized by racist policemen , prosecutors , judges , and juries . What is new is that , for the first time , whites may find it difficult to receive justice in many inner cities such as Washington , D.C. , and Los Angeles which are fertile grounds for black rage . As African American legal scholar Randan Kennedy points out , " One dissenter is all that it takes to prevent a conviction . " ( 3 ) // The Constitution guarantees citizens the right to a jury of our peers , but in a racially polarized society , who are our peers ? If justice is simply a matter of whose ethnic perspective prevails , neither African Americans nor whites can expect fairness when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This issue goes far beyond the criminal justice system . In a liberal society it is fair rules , a sense of common citizenship , and respect for reason that constitute the means to adjudicate disputes and conflicts of interest . Black rage , to the extent it affects the judicial process , is alarming because it defies prevailing norms of civility and rationality . Unchecked , such sentiments lead to fanaticism , riots , and even a possible physical conflict between the races . // These concerns are not entirely speculative . In 1990 , a black alderman from Milwaukee , Michael McGee , worked to organize African Americans in several cities into a black militia that was arming itself for war against " property " if its demands for $100 million in racial reparations were not met within five years . " The only way to get respect is to be willing to use violence , " said McGee . " I 'm talking . . . bloodshed and urban guerrilla warfare . " Inner-city blacks routinely applaud McGee 's remarks , and McGee claims that more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 4 ) // On December 7 , 1993 , Colin Ferguson , a Jamaican immigrant living in Brooklyn , converted his racial antagonism against white society into an occasion for mass murder . Ferguson boarded a commuter train from Manhattan and proceeded to shoot passengers at point blank range , killing six and wounding nineteen . Notes found in his possession suggested that Ferguson had a vendetta against whites and what he called " Uncle Tom Negroes " whom he suspected of plotting against him . Remarkably , a National Law Journal survey showed that 68 percent of African Americans were persuaded by the argument of Ferguson 's lawyers that white racism drove him to his crazed rampage . Yet Ferguson himself rejected this defense , claiming that he was being framed by racist policemen and prejudiced eyewitnesses . Although Ferguson was later convicted of murder , Martin Simmons , a black scholar at New York University , termed him " a hero " and observed , " I have colleagues who tell me they 're putting his picture on the wall next to Malcolm X. " African American psychiatrist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more blacks who have exploded because of the mistreatment that they have received at the hands of white people . " ( 5 ) // Another well-known example of black anger was the savage beating administered to white truckdriver Reginald Denny in the aftermath of the Rodney King case . The Los Angeles riots themselves showcased the resentment of poor blacks and Hispanics who burned and looted without a hint of embarrassment or remorse . African American scholar Cornel West termed the riots , in which more than fifty people died and four thousand were injured , a " display of justified social rage . " ( 6 ) Black rapper and activist Ice T struck an even more defiant note . // The most peaceful time I ever experienced in South Central was during the riots . While everybody was looking for fires , we walked through the streets . Kids were setting shit on fire , people were smiling . Everybody was shaking each other 's hands , feeling a camaraderie . It was as if the people had taken the city back. ( 7 ) // Anticipating many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted something like a martial posture . " Basically , we 're at war , " declares publisher and author Haki Madhubuti. ( 8 ) In Young , Black and Male in America , Jewelle Taylor Gibbs predicts that African American rage will eventually find violent expression in the suburbs . " The violence which young black males now direct mainly against the black community . . . will inevitably erupt and spread throughout urban and suburban America . " ( 9 ) Legal scholar Derrick Bell says : // We should appreciate the Louis Farrakhans while we 've got them . While these guys talk a lot , they do n't actuary do anything . The new crop of leaders are going to be a lot more dangerous and radical , and the next phase will probably be led by charismatic individuals , maybe even teenagers , who urge that instead of killing each other , they should go out in gangs and kill a whole lot of white people. ( 10 ) // Both a prediction and a warning , Bell 's statement suggests that multiracial societies depend on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now gone . His remarks make one wonder whether white flight to the suburbs can restore the peace or merely postpone the inevitable . Sister Souljah , Al Sharpton , and Louis Farrakhan are the bellicose prophets of black rage in America today . Like Bell , they combine threats of anarchy with forecasts of racial apocalypse . And while their appeal is mainly to poor blacks , there are signs that many successful black professionals identify with these voices of militancy , and share in the racial resentment directed against whites . Middle-class blacks , Ellis Cose writes in The Rage of a Privileged Class , suffer from " deeply repressed rage . . . . They are at least as disaffected and pessimistic as those struggling at society 's periphery . " ( 11 ) Other recent books such as Brent Staples 's Parallel Time , Jill Nelson 's Volunteer Slavery , and Nathan McCall 's Makes Me Wan na Holler convey this same molten anger . Given the intensity of black rage and its appeal to a wide constituency , whites are right to be nervous . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and reflects the irresistible temptation to attribute African American problems to a history of white racist oppression . Despite substantial progress over the past few decades , African Americans continue to show conspicuous evidence of failure - failure in the workplace , failure in schools and colleges , and failure to maintain intact families and secure communities . Taken together , these hardships and inadequacies virtually assure that blacks will not eve equality of earnings and status with other groups anytime soon . Even more seriously , they threaten to destroy poor black communities and endanger the economic and physical integrity of society as a whole . // * The annual income of African Americans who are employed in full-time jobs amounts to about 60 percent of that of whites . // * The black unemployment rate is nearly double that of the whole nation . // * One third of blacks are poor , compared with just over 10 percent of whites . // * One half of all black children live in poverty . // * The infant mortality rate for blacks is more than double that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school graduates who go on to college is lower today than in 1975. // * More young black males are in prison than in college . // * Homicide is the leading cause of death for black males between the ages of fifteen and thirty-four . // * Although African Americans make up 12 percent of the population , they , account for more than 35 percent of all AIDS cases . // * The life expectancy of black men is sixty-five years , a rate lower than any other group in America and comparable to that of some Third World countries . // * Nearly 50 percent of all African American families are headed by single women . // * More than 65 percent of black children born each year are illegitimate. ( 12 ) // What , if not racism , has caused these terrible problems ? Alvin Poussaint attributes black afflictions to enforced victimization of a nation with a " record of flagrant racial prejudice . " ( 13 ) Author John Edgar Wideman rhetorically asks , " Do black newborns die at three times the rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because being black means they 're treated by society as only one-third as valuable as white newborns ? " ( 14 ) Activist William Cavil explodes , " I do n't understand , if there 's not some conspiracy going on , how every group has managed to flourish and get ahead except African Americans . " ( 15 ) Sister Souliah charges that " racism has turned our communities into war zones , where we are dying every day . " ( 16 ) // The case for holding white racism and its historical legacy responsible for the contemporary hardships of blacks is a strong one . Film producer Spike Lee argues that " when you 're told every single day for four hundred years that you 're subhuman , when you rob people of their selfworth , knowledge and history , there 's nothing worse you can do . " ( 17 ) As Lee suggests , unlike other immigrants , African Americans did not come to this country voluntarily ; they were brought here in chains . Slavery lasted for more than two and a half centuries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wills of their masters . African American scholar Gerald Early writes that " every single black life today is tied inextricably to the tragedy of slavery . " ( 18 ) Afrocentrist Molefi Asante invokes the enduring consequences of slavery to argue that whites should pay monetary reparations , estimated in some cases at several hundred thousand dollars per family , to compensate for " wages that our ancestors lost that we now require for a new start in life . " // Others go beyond slavery to attribute African American problems to the residual effects of segregation and discriminition during the twentieth century . " Young people forget , but I am old enough to know that not long ago blacks were basically non-citizens in this country , " remarks Margaret Bush Wilson , former chairman of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) . Like many others , Wilson views segregation as an American form of apartheid , which imposed indescribable deprivation and humiliation on blacks . For much of this century most black men were forced to work in degrading menial jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had few occupations open to them other than cleaning and cooking in white households . Historian John Hope Franklin says , " Many young blacks are angry because they do not believe that we have come very far . And there are times when I have to agree with them . " // As Franklin 's remarks imply , many blacks view racism not as a thing of the past , but as a continuing force which brutally limits the aspirations of African Americans today . Many contemporary examples support this suspicion . In 1993 Christopher Wilson , a thirty-one year old black man , was abducted , robbed , and set on fire by two white men who shouted racial slurs and applauded his cries for help . The Southern Poverty Law Center reported numerous horrific hate crimes that year : two white men placed a rope around a black man 's neck and burned a cross to terrorize him ; a group of Skinheads cornered a black man whom they beat and tortured ; two white bikers assaulted an interracial couple ; a white man picked a fight with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and stabbed a Hispanic passerby who attempted to stop the fight. ( 19 ) // Although hate groups are less visible today , African Americans point out that such groups continue to spread their toxic message in America . Most people are familiar with David Duke 's past as a Nazi and Ku Klux Klan leader , but the world he claims to have left behind continues without him . In northern Idaho , white supremacist Richard Butler runs a Christian Identity church whose members are preparing for a racial Armageddon , an apocalyptic final struggle between whites on behalf of God and nonwhites on behalf of Satan . From his pulpit decorated with racist paraphernalia , Butler preaches that " the Bible is the family history of the white race . " Butler warns that white intermarriage with Jews or blacks results in " mulatto zombies. " ( 20 ) Many commentators have seized upon the recent bombing of an Oklahoma City federal building to argue that white racist extremists continue to pose a serious threat to American institutions and public safety . // Civil rights activists complain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blacks on a routine basis suffer racial discrimination in getting a job , being promoted , applying for a loan , seeking justice from the police or the courts , even in getting a taxi or being served at a restaurant . As far as minorities are concerned , Jesse Jackson protests , " All the evidence I know says there 's not a level playing field . " ( 21 ) For example , numerous accusations of racism have been registered against the national restaurant chain Denny 's . Robert Norton , a white employee , reports that as young black customers approached the doors one evening he saw Denny 's employees rush to lock the doors . Although they claimed the restaurant had closed , Norton reports that the doors were promptly opened for white customers when the blacks left . At various Denny 's restaurants across the country , African Americans were reportedly subjected to regular demands for prepayment , minimum purchase requirements , gratuities added to the bill , denials of advertised free birthday meals , back-room seatings , and scandalously rude service. ( 22 ) // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argue that white racism now operates in the form of " code words " and institutional standards that disguise deeply bigoted sentiments that dare not speak their name . " It is unlikely that racism is declining in the United States , " Alphonso Pinkney writes . " The most obvious cases of gross discrimination and segregation have somewhat abated , but the basic racism remains . " ( 23 ) Ralph Wiley argues , " When they want to say niggers , they say crime . When they want to say niggers , they say welfare . When they want to say niggers , they say drugs . " ( 24 ) Summing up both the direct and indirect evidence for the pervasiveness of bigotry , political scientist Ronald Walters said at a recent lecture , " Look at Bensonhurst . Look at Howard Beach . Look at Susan Smith blaming a black man for abducting her children when she drowned them herself . If white racism is not to blame for black problems , you tell me what is.
