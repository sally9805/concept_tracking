<p> RETRAINING <p> AND JOBS <p> Editor  --  The editorial , " Defense Workers " ( Chronicle , February 7 ) , challenges the fatuous argument that obsolete defense plants should avoid layoffs by continuing to operate . While the argument neatly likens this concept to the WPA make-work program , an elaboration could have strengthened the point . For instance , while the WPA also wasted man hours  --  in leaf raking and other useless work  --  at least it did n't squander unrenewable material resources in the production of useless products . <p> On the other hand the article 's recommendation of worker retraining programs after all smacks of sophistry , albeit a widely believed and recommended solution . For the idea to be sound , job opportunities must exist , awaiting the retrained workers . One does n't hear of such situations . <p> An instance reflecting this argument , occurred in President Johnson 's Great Society program . Printers completing the skill-training course were denied membership in the printers ' union . A retraining program is useless without a definite realizable objective . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bizarre financial policies that continue to dominate the Washington scene scare me . There is nothing to indicate that drastic cuts in interest rates are the answer to our economic problems , but they continue . What these cuts have done is drive more and more senior citizens , who rely on interest from savings to supplement low incomes , closer to the poverty line . <p> Meanwhile , desperately needed investment money is flowing overseas . Within the past month , I have seen substantial amounts invested in German bonds at 8.25 percent and Canadian utilities at 10 percent . <p> My prediction for quite some time has been that with a continuing horrendous national debt , the U.S. Treasury will eventually be faced with two alternatives  --  default or printing more money . I suspect that the latter choice has already secretly been made . <p> WINIFRED MARSHALL <p> Kensington <p> MORE AND MORE DEBT <p> Editor  --  Any president who submits a budget with a $ 352 billion deficit should never be re-elected . This , in my opinion , clearly shows that George Bush is too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are concerned with our debt , but their actions speak louder than their words . They either want to pay for Reagan and Bush 's mistakes , such as huge increases on our interest payments and bailing out S &L's,; by just adding this to our debt , or by cutting programs for the poor and elderly . <p> I hope the Democrats nominate someone like Senators Al Gore or Lloyd Bentsen , but not Jerry Brown , Paul Tsongas or Mario Cuomo . <p> WENDELL MARTIN <p> Denair ( Stanislaus County ) <p> RECYCLING <p> Editor  --  The Chronicle 's January 27 article , " Trash Haulers Fight for the Right to Recycle , " left the impression that independent recyclers and large , privately-held waste management firms are on an inevitable collision course . <p> As the nation 's largest municipal recycling company , currently servicing over 600 cities across the coun try , we feel there is ample room for a wide range of players to support California 's ambitious recycling goals . That mix includes private enterprises , nonprofit organizations and municipal governments . <p> I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as our company is concerned , small local recycling companies and nonprofit groups play an important role in educating the public as to the importance of recycling , and in many cases , actually providing various recycling services . Our latest Bay Area curbside recycling program , " CurbCycle " in the city of Hayward , is in fact an equal partnership with Tri- Ced , a nonprofit corporation which has been serving Union City . <p> Small local groups are to be applauded for having supported recycling programs in their infancy and are to be encouraged to play an important role in the implementation of the state 's recycling law , AB 939 , which requires each California city to reduce the amount of trash going to landfills 50 percent by the year 2000 . <p> To summarize the recycling debate as an " us or them " proposition is to miss the point . Recycling 50 percent of California 's waste  --  25,000,000 tons of discarded material each year  --  will require large companies , small companies and anyone else with a good heart and two hands to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Management of <p> North America , Inc . <p> Irvine ( Orange County ) <p> REUSE , NOT RECYCLE <p> Editor  --  Recycling is archaic ! Remember the good old days when the milkman ( upon delivering the milk ) would take away the empty bottles to be reused ? Why ca n't products be packaged in standardized cans and bottles to be collected , cleaned and refilled ? This business of crushing cans and bottles is absurd ! Wake up world  --  the word is reuse not recycle . <p> GREG PAGE <p> Arnold ( Calaveras County ) <p> UC STUDENT AID <p> Editor  --  It is important for students and parents to realize that the University of California encourages all students who need financial assistance in order to attend UC to apply for financial aid . <p> Your February 9 editorial , " The UC Challenge , " states that any student with a family income below $ 30,000 will not have to pay the additional $ 550 in annual fees starting next fall . It also states that those with family incomes between $ 30,000 and $ 40,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be offered loans for the balance . <p> Though students from these income brackets are entitled to relief from the $ 550 fee increase when they are in financial need , students from families with incomes above $ 40,000 may also be entitled to assistance , depending on individual circumstances . The newly announced program is designed to supplement , not replace , the University Fee Grant Program , which was established to mitigate the impact of fee increases on low- and-middle-income students . <p> Financial aid application forms are available at most high schools , colleges and UC campuses . <p> KATE JEFFERY , acting director <p> UC Office of <p> Student Financial Support <p> ' NO SCALPEL ' VASECTOMY <p> Editor  --  America 's most popular form of birth control for married women is having their tubes tied . And , although sterilization is more complicated and riskier for women than men , many more women than men have birth control operations . <p> It may be that men fear their sex drive will disappear after vasectomy . But this is a myth . <p> For men who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is good news . Now there is a fairly new and relatively painless " no scalpel " vasectomy . This is a safe and simple procedure that takes about 20 minutes and is no more painful than giving blood . <p> Therefore , I urge men who have considered getting a vasectomy in the past but were afraid , to reconsider . With this safe and simple procedure , both women and men can share equally in the responsibility of birth control . <p> DR . MAURICE SANDLER <p> West Contra Costa <p> Urological Group <p> San Pablo <p> PRISONS IN BAJA <p> Editor  --  I recently read where the state of California is having difficulty in keeping up with the building of prisons to house the huge population . The prison terms have been reduced to make room for the new prisoners . The article also states that it was costing the taxpayers about $ 35,000 a year to house and feed a prisoner . <p> Would it be possible to negotiate an arrangement with Mexico to build a huge camp in the middle of Baja California to take these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish from the gulf would provide a good diet , the Mexicans could get their roads improved and the security problem would be minimal . <p> WILLIAM G.
