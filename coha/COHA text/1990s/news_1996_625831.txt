<p> PITTSBURGH - The Steelers ' braintrust made a decision during the last offseason that confounded some of their closest observers . Although Pittsburgh has always been known as a team that stresses the run to set up the pass , coach Bill Cowher recognized a potential problem and set out to solve it before it became too big to overcome . <p> Running back Barry Foster , who could n't handle quarterback Neil O'Donnell 's fourth-down pass in the final seconds of the loss to San Diego in the AFC Championship Game , was traded to Carolina . <p> Although Foster had become disgruntled with his role and was getting to be more trouble than he was worth , he was still a power runner who could also get outside . For three years , he had been wearing down opponents . <p> Bam Morris , who had an impressive rookie season , was ready to be elevated into the starting role , or so the coaches thought . <p> But Morris got fat in the off-season , so Cowher signed Erric Pegram , a finesse runner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get in shape , the Steelers would not have the kind of running game that have on so successfully through the years . <p> At the same time , Cowher realized his young receivers were starting to develop into genuine threats . They had to because Pro Bowl tight end Eric Green had departed for Miami through free agency , and No. 1 pick Mark Bruener was not ready to play at a level comparable to Green . <p> After Neil O'Donnell became a better passing quarterback last season , Cowher recognized the need to open up the offense . He put that task on the shoulders of well-respected offensive coordinator Ron Erhardt , another conservative coach who loves to pound the ball between the tackles . The results has been spectacular , but there were growing pains . <p> The Steelers started slow when Morris was out of shape and O'Donnell was injured . When O'Donnell got healthy , he picked up where he left off in last year 's playoffs and Morris slowly rounded into shape . <p> The receivers caught everything thrown to them . Yancey Thigpen set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down-field receiver since Louis Lipps . Ernie Mills developed into a good deep threat . Even Bruener progressed faster than the coaches anticipated . <p> It was Cowher who suggested to Erhardt that rookie quarterback Kordell Stewart be utilized as a runner and receiver . The result of that experiment has generated Stewart , Erhardt and the Steelers all kinds of positive publicity . The bottom line , of course , is winning , and the Steelers have done that exceptionally well over the second half of the season . <p> When the Steelers host the Colts in the AFC Championship Game today , fans will see a Pittsburgh offense that bears little resemblance to offenses of old . <p> They throw the ball more than they run . " We 've got a lot more things we 're able to do , and we utilize a lot more people , " Erhardt says . " We use a lot more packages . That 's been a big help in getting the good mixture we want . " <p> The changes helped the Steelers score a club-record 407 points . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bowl receiver in 10 years . And the more the passing game has worked , the better the running game has become . Morris has rushed for at least 100 yards in three of the last four games . <p> Pegram even has a 100-yard game within the last month . <p> " With our passing game , I do n't feel like we 're ever out of a game , " center Dermontti Dawson says . " We feel better than we did last year . We 've got balance , and we 're putting more points on the board . That 's a tough combination to beat . " <p> Oilers coach in demand - New Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson is interested in Oilers linebackers coach Gregg Williams , who could be interviewed at the Senior Bowl this week . The Oilers hope to sign Williams , who did an outstanding job with the linebackers this season , to a new contract as soon as possible . When he coached the defensive backs and special teams under Jack Pardee , Chicago and Denver were interested in Williams , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jimmy - Word out of Miami is Jimmy Johnson wants to hire Cowboys linebackers coach Jim Eddy as his defensive coordinator . Eddy impressed Johnson when he coached the Oilers ' defense . When the Oilers fired Eddy after the 1993 playoff collapse at Buffalo , Johnson hired him as a defensive assistant at Dallas just to get him on the staff . <p> The rumor mill - It 's that time of year when the rumor mill is turning so hard it 's smoking . How about this one : Texas A &M; coach R.C. Slocum replaces Buddy Ryan in Arizona , and Jack Pardee returns to his alma mater to replace Slocum ? Here 's another one . John Mackovic is hired by Tampa Bay , and the Longhorns replace him with Northwestern 's Gary Barnett or San Francisco 's Alan Lowry , who played quarterback at the University of Texas . <p> Another rumor that is building momentum has Art Modell firing Bill Belichick and hiring Don Shula . Modell always has been one of Shula 's biggest fans . Dolphins sources say Shula would get back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bay wants to steal some of Miami 's thunder over hiring Jimmy Johnson , the Bucs might consider Shula . <p> Oilers win honors - Four Oilers earned honors in Pro Football Weekly 's postseason awards voted on by veteran NFL reporters . <p> Guard Bruce Matthews and strong safety Blaine Bishop made the All-AFC Team . Receiver Chris Sanders and defensive tackle Gary Walker made the All-Rookie Team . Sanders was paired with his former Ohio State teammate and good friend , Joey Galloway of Seattle . <p> A super invitation - Congratulations are in order for Bruce Molzan , the Ruggles Grill chef and owner who has been invited back to the Super Bowl for Taste of the NFL V. Coca-Cola and the NFL invite a top chef and former NFL player to help tackle hunger . Molzan is being paired with former Oilers quarterback Charley Johnson . Oilers defensive tackle Ray Childress will be on hand to assist . They 'll whip up gourmet dishes and serve their best wines at a star-studded , $ 300-a-plate charity gala at the Arizona Biltmore the night before Super Bowl XXX @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five-year contributions at more than $ 1 million for charities that feed the hungry . There is a recipe book , NFL Cities ' Cafe , featuring specialties created by 30 chefs in league cities . Molzan 's dish is on the cover . The book can be ordered by calling 1 800 410-0577 . <p> Proceeds go to hunger-relief agencies . Molzan seeks corporate sponsorships to cover food costs . Anyone interested should contact him at 524-3839 . <p> Juniors elevate draft - What looked to be an average draft at most positions got an infusion of young talent when so many underclassmen declared by Wednesday 's deadline . Such players as Ohio State receiver Terry Glenn , Texas A &M; running back Leeland McElroy , Nebraska running back Lawrence Phillips , Michigan running back Tim Biakabutuka , UCLA running back Karim Abdul-Jabbar and Texas defensive end Tony Brackens are guaranteed of being first-round picks . <p> And others could vault into the first round after workouts before the draft . Receiver was the strongest position , but the influx of juniors has moved running back even with the receivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Randall Cunningham says he wants to return to the Eagles , they are not interested . They ran out of patience with him last week before they lost to the Cowboys . He left the practice facility Wednesday to travel to Las Vegas to be present for the birth of his child , but he did n't take his playbook . <p> He did n't return until Saturday a few hours before they left for Dallas . He refuses to give them his telephone number in Las Vegas , and he did not return three calls they left on his pager . <p> When Rodney Peete left the game with an injury and Cunningham was forced into the lineup , the Eagles had to reduce their game plan . " " We lost a lot of our package when Rodney went down , " owner Jeffrey Lurie says . <p> Cards might look to Walsh - When he fired Buddy Ryan , Cardinals owner Bill Bidwill said he would consult Bill Walsh about possible replacements . Now Walsh sounds as if he might be interested in taking a front-office job if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an insult to the Cardinals to say I 'm not interested , " Walsh said , " " but I 'm certainly not seeking employment . If the right circumstances were to arrive , I 'd be interested in returning in the management end . " <p> What a coup that would be for Bidwill . If Bidwill asks Walsh about coaching candidates , he would recommend four : former UCLA coach Terry Donahue , Packers offensive coordinator Sherman Lewis , Chiefs offensive coordinator Paul Hackett and Falcons assistant head coach Milt Jackson . <p> Oilers fans can sympathize - Fans in Kansas City were so upset over the 10-7 loss to the Colts last week that a mental-health care facility offered counseling . There is no truth to the rumor kicker Lin Elliott called the hotline . <p> Anyone in the telephone directory named Elliott with the name Lin , Lynn or the initial L. was in trouble . There were reports irate fans called those numbers and cursed out whoever answered and made threats . <p> Most of Elliott 's teammates backed him even though he missed three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have sent the game into overtime , but linebacker Derrick Thomas blasted him . <p> On defensive end Neil Smith 's radio show , Thomas said if Elliott were to walk into the restaurant/bar where the show was originating , he would " " kick his butt . " <p> Colts should mail it in - This is n't good news for the Colts . <p> Kansas City coach Marty Schottenheimer is 5-10 in the playoffs after losing to Indianapolis . Teams that beat Schottenheimer in the playoffs usually lose in the next round . They are 1-8 in the game following a victory over him . <p> The only team that beat Schottenheimer and won its next game was Buffalo in 1991 . The Bills followed with a win over Denver in the AFC Championship Game . <p> All the other teams that beat a Schottenheimer-coached team lost their next game : 1985 Miami , 1986 Denver , 1987 Denver , 1988 Oilers , 1990 Miami , 1992 San Diego , 1993 Buffalo and 1994 Miami . The odds say put your money on the Steelers today . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is expected to trade quarterback Gus Frerotte . Coach Norv Turner wants to play Heath Shuler on a full-time basis , and having two young quarterbacks is causing them more problems than they anticipated . They are talking about offering Frerotte and their No. 1 pick to the Jets to move up to get the first pick . <p> St. Louis is another team that is interested . The Rams , who are interested in Oilers quarterback Chris Chandler , are going to shop running back Jerome Bettis , who was such a disappointment with 637 yards rushing on 183 carries , both career lows . After moving from Anaheim to St. Louis , the Rams ' generated $ 6.6 more in stadium revenue , the highest increase in the NFL . Last week against Green Bay , the 49ers lost their first playoff game last week for the first time since 1987 . Expect the 49ers to make a run at Giants running back Rodney Hampton , an unrestricted free agent . They also might be interested in Ronnie Harmon in the free-agent market . <p> Cowboys own Shurmur - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-deserved attention for designing defenses that befuddle the 49ers . But he has not been as fortunate against the Cowboys . <p> Since running back Emmitt Smith joined quarterback Troy Aikman and receiver Michael Irvin in 1990 , Shurmur has been the coordinator for three different teams , and he is 0-10 during that time . . . Chicago has not been known as a team that produces quarterbacks , but four former Bears are playing in the championship games today . Jim Harbaugh starts for Indianapolis . Paul Justin backs up Harbaugh . Jim McMahon is No. 2 in Green Bay , and Mike Tomczak is the backup in PittsburghWhen Steve Spurrier turned down Tampa Bay 's offer , he was given a raise to $ 1 million per year by the University of Florida , which also agreed to give nice pay hikes to his assistant coachesMinnesota defensive coordinator Tony Dungy is a candidate to replace Sam Wyche in Tampa <p> Harbaugh in record book - Jim Harbaugh is the sixth quarterback to win passing titles in the NCAA and NFL . He was No. 1 in the NFL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played at Michigan . Other quarterbacks to accomplish the feat were John Brodie , Tommy Kramer , Steve Young , Charlie Conerly and Brian Sipe . <p> NOTES : John McClain covers the Oilers and NFL for the Chronicle .
