<p> JEAN FLEISCHHACKER tried doing it herself . It was n't pretty . " I could n't pull it together , " she said . " I was having trouble choosing fabrics  --  nothing worked out when I got it home . " She tried sponge-painting her walls  --  " I had taken a class , " Ms. Fleischhacker said . She gave herself an A for effort , but the result flunked . <p> David Jackson had a confident collecting eye . " But I do n't have any spatial ability , " Mr. Jackson said . Who was going to wedge the brooding timber of his Gustav Stickley furniture , the crowdied skies of an American landscape painting collection , his art books and art objects into a one-bedroom Chelsea apartment , which hoarded most of its space in a 14-by-24-foot living room that felt like a fat hallway . <p> So , in each case , Ms. Fleischhacker and Mr. Jackson did the unthinkable . They hired a decorator . Ms. Fleischhacker , an investment banker , and Mr. Jackson , whose business is real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  leading glossy lives in " done " interiors or blowing big checks dry . <p> But living and working in New York , with leisure caught in the bind , they needed homes to come home to , where they could relax or entertain , and they needed help . <p> " I had spent a lot of money at this point , " Ms. Fleischhacker said . " And then I thought , ' There are people who do this professionally . ' " <p> With co-op sales booming and rents skyrocketing , an increasing number of New Yorkers will find themselves facing expensive decisions about furnishing new homes or sitting pretty by refitting old ones . <p> They may have crossed a mental threshhold and hired housekeepers , nannies or dog walkers . But many will enter the market for decorating services this year  --  as beginners . According to the American Society of Interior Designers , referrals nationally more than doubled last year . <p> Ms. Fleischhacker and Mr. Jackson were first-timers . And they were nervous about the reports : serious money , no control . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square yard of decorators ' reputations . Was the decorator 's budget going to be as mysterious as the decorator 's source of inspiration ? How did you find a decorator ? And how did you lose one if you had to ? <p> " It 's the only profession I can think of where there 's really no contract , and you 're dealing with very big money , " said Craig Higgins , the decorator Ms. Fleischhacker hired . " It 's a very weird kind of business that way . " <p> Ms. Fleischhacker and Mr. Jackson did what many first-timers do . Each found a decorator through a referral  --  a good , mutual friend . <p> " I did n't feel like I wanted to spend a lot of time looking at other people  --  I felt a good rapport with Craig , " said Ms. Fleischhacker , who had admired his work . <p> Having established trust and taste guidelines , each client and decorator sat down to talk about the job . " You do a floor plan , with a furniture layout and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Christopher Coleman , the decorator David Jackson hired . Mr. Coleman had designed a room for Robert Wooley , the late decorative arts specialist at Sotheby 's and Mr. Jackson 's best friend . " An overall package , " he added . " That 's usually what I present to a client . " <p> Mr. Higgins presented Ms. Fleischhacker with homework : mark favorite styles in magazines , and he would make method of the melee . " Then we do the plan  --  the way the furniture 's going to be configured , what all this furniture 's likely to cost , " he said . " Then we go forward with the scheme  --  color , fabrics . " <p> In each case , the client proceeded with a first room , as a kind of brake on the budget and as a reassuring try-out on both sides . ( Decorators dismiss clients , too . ) Ms. Fleischhacker said of doing it piecemeal : " I definitely had trepidations . I became more comfortable because of how we decided to work together . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like one room , was easier to grasp . Mr. Coleman , explained : " It was n't going to be a big project . David knew what he liked , but then when he got into a room , he did n't know what to do , where to put what , or what else he needed . " <p> How was the money handled  --  between client and decorator ? <p> " We discussed billing , " said Ms. Fleischhacker , who signed no contract with Mr. Higgins . " We did n't discuss overall budget . " <p> " It 's a per-piece thing , even with fabrications , " Mr. Higgins said . " You say , ' Do you want this silk velvet  --  at $400 a yard ? ' I showed Jean a range . She let me know where she wanted to be pricewise . " <p> From her magazine choices , Ms. Fleischhacker made it clear she favored a warm palette and rich fabrics  --  and she showed Mr. Higgins where her priorities lay . " Craig figured out I was n't going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I was n't looking for high-end antiques or a Persian rug  --  that was n't my style . " <p> Like many other decorators , Mr. Higgins took a commission on antique furnishings that he found and bought for his client . Dealers typically give decorators discounts on listed prices , usually 10 to 30 percent ; the decorator bills the client for the listed price . Mr. Higgins charged a finder 's fee for anything he bought at auction . For new furnishings and fabrics , he charged Ms. Fleischhacker a retail markup of 100 percent on the manufacturer 's wholesale price . For custom work , like wiring lamps or treating fabrics , Mr. Higgins gave an estimate first . <p> In addition , Mr. Higgins charged an hourly consulting fee . " Every time I 'm with the client , when we 're not shopping  --  because I then get my commission from the vendor  --  it 's $100 an hour , " he said . " It makes the client watch the time , instead of sitting down to tea to talk about the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different arrangement , also considered standard by many decorators . " I signed a contract , for the first room , " Mr. Jackson said . " Each room became another contract . " It included a set , not hourly , design fee of $1,500 for Mr. Coleman 's scheme , drawings and shopping services . It also formalized his retail markup of 25 percent and a finder 's fee of 15 percent on antique pieces , on all items purchased for the project . Mr. Coleman created an oasis of soft , light color for Mr. Jackson , with some exoticism in the fabrics , furniture and wall treatments for the collector . <p> " Chris calmed things down and edited out a lot , " said Mr. Jackson , who hoped to make a simpler life in his new rental apartment . " We were trying to make it as serene as possible , not busy , with all this stuff I had . He never imposed his taste on the directions I would go in , but he helped me to focus , which is the sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to part with most of his dark-wood Arts and Crafts furniture ; the sale bolstered Mr. Jackson 's decorating budget . Mr. Coleman helped him shop instead for lighter but bolder pieces like a Louis XVI daybed , which could command one end of the long room to create a sitting area and also provide a window seat , a place where Mr. Jackson could read . <p> Mr. Coleman studded the ceiling beams and border with a box of nailheads to provide inexpensive architecture for a room without moldings , strengthening his proposal by showing his client similar interiors from the 1920 's and 30 's . <p> " I was against it at first , " Mr. Jackson said . " I thought it was going to be a big display thing . " Mr. Coleman gambled he could get it right . One weekend when his client was away , he put them up himself . <p> Mr. Coleman talked Mr. Jackson out of an expensive Oriental carpet , choosing instead a less claustrophobic , neutral wool sisal remnant he found for $800 . He also covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African kuba cloth , bought from a street merchant in SoHo . <p> Mr. Coleman commissioned a decorative painter to stripe the foyer with a design his client found in a book on Moorish art . At $1,500 , it was less expensive than a comparable wallpaper . Mr. Coleman covered the bedroom walls with brown butcher 's paper he found at a paper company  --  at $35 a roll . The effect is closer to buffed leather than brown walls . <p> Both clients were impressed by the wide professional net that decorators can cast when they look for that one part that will help a design supersede its sum . " I have some unique pieces of furniture now , " Ms. Fleischhacker said . " You 're not just going to find them in a department store . " <p> Mr. Higgins kept and recovered Ms. Fleischhacker 's sofa and a daybed . He hand-laundered and tea-stained the damasks she chose , to soften the colors and give them more character . <p> Then he supplemented her furniture with 1930 's English armchairs , new wicker-back chairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auction houses , antique shops and furniture showrooms . <p> Contrary to the trade secrecy that decorators are criticized for , Mr. Higgins shared resources freely with Ms. Fleischhacker . She picked her own hall carpets , after Mr. Higgins told her to look at sisals . In both cases , the clients brought something to the party . Ms. Fleischhacker told Mr. Higgins about the Curtain Exchange in Connecticut , a consignment shop for expensive decorators ' window treatments orphaned by redecoration . Ms. Fleischhacker found ready-sewn Austrian silk curtains for the bedroom and drapery for the living room , saving thousands of dollars . ( He dyed them . ) <p> After nearly four years of cautious collaboration , Ms. Fleischhacker and Mr. Jackson claim satisfaction with their decorators . <p> The biggest frustration  --  time . <p> " The hardest part was to give up the idea that once you hire a decorator , it will all just happen , " Mr. Jackson said . " Once I did , the process became enjoyable . I 've become interested in the whole thing  --  how things are made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And they 're still decorating . Ms. Fleischhacker and Mr. Higgins are shopping for a Beidermeier secretary , to use as a home office . When interviewed , Mr. Jackson had just come in from Sunday morning shopping with Mr. Coleman . He took a seat on the floor of his decorated apartment , his back to the Louis XVI daybed . <p> " I 'm thinking of doing something a little more modern in this room , " he said . His decorator will be there to help him change his mind .
