What to expect : Stocks and bonds may seesaw early in 1995 as inflation fears and higher interest rates rattle the markets . What to do : Next year , as always , find an asset mix that delivers the growth you need with minimum risk . You 've probably already read our views on what lies ahead for the financial markets in 1995 ( if not , see " How to Make Money in 1995 , " page 26 ) . And you may even have pored over our recommendations for specific investments that will benefit from the trends we see taking hold ( see the articles on pages 34 , 44 , 70 and 80 ) . But when you 're seeking to meet long-term goals  --  say , your children 's college education or your retirement  --  you need to divide your money among different types of investments . What 's more , the mix of assets you choose may be even more important than the individual securities and mutual funds you select . The strategy known as asset allocation can guide you to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What asset allocation gives you is the maximum returns for the risk you are willing to take , " says Harold Evensky , a financial planner in Coral Gables , Fla . Asset allocation is based on the idea that each type of investment offers its own characteristic trade-off between risk and reward . Stocks , for example , deliver the highest returns over extended periods but are subject to occasional losses that can easily hit 15% to 20% in three months ' time . Bonds , on the other hand , typically return less than stocks but provide steady income and often rise in value when stocks are falling . While the best asset-allocation strategies produce investment recipes you can leave in place for long stretches , you still must evaluate your portfolio at least once a year . For one thing , smart investors adjust their mixes subtly to take advantage of changing market conditions . As we state elsewhere in this issue , for example , growth stocks are likely to outperform value shares in 1995 . So , in the equity portion of your portfolio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchases of growth-oriented issues such as the nine domestic stock funds cited in the article on page 34 . Furthermore , an annual inspection of your asset mix helps you to rejigger your portfolio to reflect the ups and downs of the past year . In the first 10 months of 1994 , for example , long-term government bond funds lost 7.6% on average . As a result of such declines , bonds probably constitute a smaller portion of your investments than they did at the beginning of the year . To rebalance your portfolio , you would sell some stockholdings and use the proceeds to buy bonds . On the following pages , we profile three couples at different stages of life facing a wide range of financial challenges in 1995 . As a guide for how they  --  and you  --  can meet these long-term objectives , we present three model portfolios designed by Ibbotson Associates , the Chicago financial research and consulting firm . In each case , Ibbotson recommends a mix of stocks and bonds intended to deliver the growth these families need to meet their goals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build on Ibbotson 's allocation guidelines , we 've asked three financial planners to suggest the best investments for each family in 1995 . If you do not see your precise situation mirrored here , you still should be able to adapt the ideas we discuss to fit your own needs . How a young family invests for a home  --  and tuition bills For Tom Mendez , working his way through college at San Jose State University has paid off in more ways than one . His part-time job at Paramount 's Great America amusement park in Santa Clara , Calif. led to a full-time career as a food service manager there after he was graduated with a B.S. in business management in 1989. ( is annual salary is now near $40,000 . ) And as a bonus , one of his co-workers became his wife : Lisa Mendez is now a nursing manager at a hospital in San Jose . Moreover , Tom feels his work/study experience prepared him for adult budgeting , spending and investing . " It was a great way to learn the value of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Lisa , 30 , hope to save enough to cover at least half of their 15-month-old daughter Tamara 's future college expenses . If college costs continue to rise at their recent average of 7.5% a year , just one year at a public college , which now averages $8,562 , could run more than $29,000 when Tamara is 18 . To pay half of Tamara 's tab for . four years , Tom and Lisa would have to come up with $65,000 or so . In the meantime , they hope to move to a larger house in five or six years . The Mendezes estimate they 'll need $100,000 for the down payment and closing costs , half of which could come from the equity they figure they 'll have by that time in the three-bedroom townhouse they now own in San lose . Those are a couple of daunting goals , but the Mendezes are off to a promising start . Out of their combined income of $85,000 , each month they invest $100 to $200 in Series EE U.S. Savings Bonds for Tamara 's college fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face value of $2,400 . They direct an additional $750 a month toward their emergency cash reserve , which now totals $8,500 , stored in a Calvert California Tax Free Reserves Money Market account paying 3.2% . Once that cushion reaches $10,000 , they will direct the monthly $750 toward the down payment on their future home . And Tom and Lisa are n't neglecting retirement . Both contribute to tax-deferred 401(k) savings plans at work ; their combined total is $28,600 , of which 56% is in stocks and 44% in bonds . Because the Mendezes are investing for two goals at the same time  --  one short term , one long term  --  Ibbotson recommends that they put 75% of the money they save into stocks and 25% into generally less volatile short- and intermediate-term bonds . ( If they were simply saving for the distant goal of Tamara 's education , they might stash as much as 90% in equities ; in any case , savings bonds alone wo n't provide sufficient growth for a college fund . ) Ibbotson prescribes the following breakdown : 40% in large-company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short-term bonds and 15% intermediate-term bonds . That allocation would give the Mendezes a solid seven-in-10 chance of earning 10% annually over the next five years . Assuming they continued to save $750 a month during that time , they would amass $58,562 , more than enough for the down payment . And the heavy concentration in stocks gives them a 45% chance of earning 14.1% a year , according to Ibbotson 's calculations , which would leave them with a hefty $65,583 at the end of five years  --  enough for the down payment on a new home and a running start on Tamara 's college fund . With the Mendezes ' near-term goals in mind , Carl Camp , a Fullerton , Calif. financial planner , recommends conservative stock funds . Camp 's picks include : Scudder Growth &; Income ( no load ; up an annual average of 12.1% over the past three years to Nov. 11 ; 800-225-2470 ) , which invests in large-company stocks with above-average yields ; Babson Enterprise II ( no load ; up 10.9% ; 800-422-2766 ) , a small-company value fund that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warburg Pincus International ( see " Go for Growth With 12 Funds That Can Earn 22% or More " on page 34 ) . If growth stocks shine in 1995 , as MONEY forecasts , Vanguard U.S. Growth ( no load ; up 7% ; 800-852-4999 ) would be a great choice , Camp says , since the fund has historically done well when growth shares pace the market . As for the fixed-income portion of their portfolio , Camp suggests that the Mendezes stop putting money into savings bonds , because the couple can get better returns elsewhere without exposing themselves to significant risk . Camp recommends two no-load , low-expense bond funds : Vanguard Fixed Income Short Term Corporate ( yield : 7.1% ) and intermediate-term T. Rowe Price New Income ( yield : 7% ; 800-638-5660 ) . With college bills taken care of , early retirement beckons Greg and Marilyn Strobel have cleared the first major hurdle of family finance : making sure they can pay college bills for their three kids , Carrie , 19 ( a sophomore at Notre Dame ) , Dan , 17 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a fifth-grader . Each child has a separate portfolio ( managed by Greg , a dentist ) that should easily be able to cover the full cost of their undergraduate educations . Now the Chicago couple , both 45 , can turn their investment attention toward early retirement in 10 or 15 years . " Our investments have ensured the kids ' education and freed me to have a flexible work life , " says Marilyn , a part-time high school administrator . " My dream for retirement would be to spend more time with my husband . " Greg Strobel has been managing money almost as long as he 's been drilling teeth . He joined his father 's practice 19 years ago , fresh out of the University of Illinois dental school and already married . Soon he was supervising the office 's retirement plan . But unlike his father , who studied the stock market practically every day for more than 40 years , charting prices and conferring with his broker , Greg favors no-load mutual funds such as Nicholas and Lindner , limiting his oversight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund picking , he and his wife now have $350,000 saved for retirement . Greg has 78% of that nest egg in stocks  --  a figure that is just about on target , according to Ibbotson , since the Strobels have at least 10 years until retirement . Ibbotson analysts point out , however , that they can boost their return without taking on more risk by upping their stakes in two areas where they currently have very small holdings : international and small-company stocks . A retirement savings portfolio with 40 in large-company stocks , 15o small-caps and 25% international , with the rest in short- and intermediate-term bonds , would have almost a 90% chance of earning an 8.5% annual return over the next 15 years . That would give the couple a tidy $1.4 million to launch their life of leisure . And Ibbotson calculates that the Strobels have a four-in-10 shot at earning 14.7% annually , which would boost that portfolio to $3.2 million . With the inflation rate expected to rise slightly during 1995 before leveling off , Bloomington , Minn. financial planner Robert Steffen suggests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hedge against a rising cost of living . Two such choices , Steffen says , would be Fidelity Real Estate Portfolio ( no load ; up 11.7% ; 800-544-8888 ) , a fund that invests in real estate investment trusts and shares of construction companies ; and Vanguard Specialized Energy Portfolio ( no load ; up 10.3% ) , which has 90% of its assets in oil companies . For the small-stock portion of the Strobels ' retirement portfolio , Steffen recommends Meridian ( see the story on page 34 ) . For international diversification , Steffen likes Scudder International ( no load ; up 11% ) , which tends to invest in large , non-U.S . companies that would benefit from the global economic recovery ; and the more aggressive Lexington Worldwide : Emerging Markets ( no load ; up 19% ; 800-526-0056 ) . Retirees who need to make their money last longer Although Sheldon Golubzik was a life-long resident of Massachusetts , the harsh climate in the Northeast became less bearable after he took early retirement from his job as a small-appliance salesman at Sears two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was home all day , " he says . So he and his wife Barbara , both 63 , headed to Mission Viejo , Calif. , for the warm weather and for the proximity to their 33-year-old son , who lives 60 miles north in Venice . When Sheldon left Sears during a restructuring , he chose a lump-sum payout rather than a pension , figuring he had a better chance of keeping up with inflation if he invested the money himself . His total take : $275,000 , which included the money he had saved in a company-stock purchase plan during his 37 years on the job . Over the next two years , Sheldon , a novice investor , gradually diversified his stake , putting roughly equal parts into stock funds , bond funds and a fixed annuity . The Golubziks live simply , in the $200,000 townhouse condominium they bought with a $100,000 down payment from the sale of their home . " I cursed raking leaves for years , " says Sheldon , " so now it 's a pleasure to have someone else cut the grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need about $50,000 a year to cover their living expenses and those of their 35-year-old daughter Lisa , who is disabled and lives with them . The Golubziks and their daughter receive a total of $23,000 a year in Social Security benefits , so they need their portfolio to provide income of $27,000 a year and to continue to grow to keep pace with inflation . " Our goal is to live out the balance of our lives as comfortably as we did before we retired and to leave a little legacy for our children , " says Sheldon . To reach that goal , the Golubziks must structure their portfolio to provide both income and capital appreciation . Accordingly , Ibbotson analysts recommend that they keep a total of 60% of their money in stocks for at least the next 10 years . Here are the specifics : 30% in large-company stocks , 10% in small-company stocks ; and 20% in foreign shares . The Golubziks should divide the remaining 40% evenly between short-term and intermediate-term bonds . This portfolio would have an 83% chance of returning 8% annually for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earn 12.5% . Unfortunately , however , those shrewd allocations ca n't overcome a fundamental problem . According to Paul Westbrook , who heads a retirement planning firm based in Watchung , N.J. , the Golubziks simply do n't have enough money to support their lifestyle for an extended period and still have something left for their kids . " Even with the best-case scenario for the portfolio , their savings are not sufficient for a long retirement , " says Westbrook . For example , if their investments earn 12.5% annually and inflation remains at a low 3% , the Golubziks will deplete their retirement savings in 20 years . Westbrook 's suggestion : The Golubziks should cut down on their living expenses to make their savings last . If they can get by on $40,000 annually and if their nest egg earns the more likely 8% , their money will last 28 years , or until they are both 91 . Since the Golubziks are fairly new stock investors , Westbrook recommends a conservative , low-expense index fund such as Vanguard Index 500 ( no load ; up 9.4% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall market as measured by the S &P; 500-stock index . For their needed international exposure , Westbrook favors T. Rowe Price International Stock ( no load ; up 12.3% ) , which diversifies its almost 300 holdings among more than 25 countries , dampening its risk . Westbrook notes that after a rocky year for stocks and bonds  --  and with yields on ultrasafe money funds rising  --  income-oriented investors like the Golubziks may be tempted to retreat from their long-term plan and take refuge in cash . But that would be a mistake , he says : " This is when you need to be sticking with your asset allocation , because you want to be in the market to benefit when stocks and bonds take off .
