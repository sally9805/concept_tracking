<p> It is hard to imagine a more unlikely outpost of women 's political activism than this tiny village of crude stone houses and hand-tilled fields , lying in a narrow valley almost two hours by four-wheel-drive vehicle from the nearest paved road . <p> There is no school , no electricity , no television . Most residents can neither read nor write . The main legal authority is not the central government but the local tribal leader , who adjudicates land disputes and criminal cases in the manner of a feudal lord . <p> For the last several months , however , women here have been subjected to tireless proselytizing on the meaning of democracy by Warda Ghaylan , a 25-year-old mother of three and one of the few village women with any formal education . Ghaylan is a foot soldier in a nationwide effort to boost women 's participation in Sunday 's national parliamentary elections , the second since North and South Yemen were merged in 1990 after decades of warfare . <p> " I tell them , ' Your vote is the key to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a graceful woman in a floral-print robe , her gleaming white teeth contrasting vividly with her black head scarf . " Yes , they listen to me , but sometimes when they hear that I 've come to talk to them about the elections , they hide . They think people will come in big cars and take them away to vote in a faraway place . " <p> Notwithstanding such challenges , a beguiling experiment in representative government has begun in this tradition-bound Muslim country of 14 million people  --  an isolated , otherworldly place where men while away afternoons chewing a mildly narcotic plant called khat and rarely appear in public without a curved dagger strapped to their waists . <p> It is an experiment , moreover , in which women are playing a prominent role . Yemeni feminists in veils and billowy black robes are organizing voter registration drives , fielding female candidates and even cutting political deals with conservative tribal chiefs and the country 's largest Islamic party , the Yemeni Islah Party . <p> The outcome could reverberate well beyond Yemen 's borders . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Islamic fundamentalists , democracy advocates look to Yemen as a potential bright spot . Saudi Arabia and other autocratic neighbors , meanwhile , see it as a bad example that could weaken their grip on power . <p> " I think we are having a unique experience in the Arab world , " said Abdel-Karim Iryani , a Yale-educated biogeneticist and computer aficionado  --  he is especially fond of Yemen 's home page on the World Wide Web  --  who serves as the country 's foreign minister . <p> Situated on the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula at the entrance to the Red Sea , Yemen seems closer in spirit to Mogadishu than Monticello . One of the poorest Arab countries , Yemen is famously anarchic , to the point where government officials sometimes have to seek permission from local sheiks when crossing tribal boundaries . Many tribes consider the taking of hostages , including Western tourists , an honorable way of settling disputes with the government . <p> Only three years ago , the former South Yemen tried to secede from the north , bombarding the capital city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . Relations between north and south are still so strained that the largest southern opposition party , the Yemeni Socialist Party , is boycotting Sunday 's election . <p> Nor is the central government a model of political enlightenment . The government of President Ali Abdallah Salih , who has ruled for nearly 20 years , stands accused of numerous human rights abuses . <p> Women face their own problems . Roughly 80 percent of Yemeni women are illiterate , compared with 35 percent of men ; the country 's limited supply of secondary schools is largely reserved for boys . <p> Such disparities are reflected in political life . Just two of 301 members of parliament are women . During the last elections in 1993 , the 43 female candidates encountered so much hostility that only three have chosen to run again . This year , only 16 of more than 2,000 candidates are women ; most of them are running as independents because major parties refuse to back them . <p> None of that deters Raufa Hassan , 38 , a university professor who directs a voter-education project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the European Union . <p> For Hassan , who holds a doctorate in communication from the University of Paris , the trick is to focus on the long term . " We tell them , ' Even though voting is n't going to get you anywhere . . . it 's going to be good for your kids , ' " she said . <p> Yemen 's experiment with democracy happened almost by chance . The unification of the conservative north and the socialist south left Salih and his ruling party , the General People 's Congress , on top . So the northern leaders sought to placate the south by granting more power to opposition parties . Tribal leaders , meanwhile , have begun to learn the art of ward politics , promising to deliver votes in exchange for roads , schools and water projects . <p> Despite weak representation in parliament , women are not entirely powerless . Earlier this month , for example , the highest-ranking woman in Yemen 's government , Undersecretary of Information Amat Aleem Sosowa , was horrified to learn that parliament had passed legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So she contacted the legal adviser to Salih , who obligingly sent the law back to parliament without his signature . <p> Even the Islah party , whose extremist wing has barred the use of Western musical instruments in its campaign jingles , has been signing up women voters in its strongholds  --  betting that most of them will vote as their husbands do . <p> Saudi Arabia has taken a dim view of the democratic goings-on next door . At a January meeting in Tunisia , the Saudi interior minister , Prince Nayef , urged his Yemeni counterpart to cancel the parliamentary elections as a threat to stability in the region , according to a senior Yemeni official and Western diplomats . <p> The involvement of women in politics is especially disturbing to Saudi Arabia  --  a country so conservative that it does not permit women to drive  --  and other autocratic states on the Arabian Peninsula . <p> The center of the get-out-the-vote effort in Yemen is the Arab Democratic Institute , Hassan 's organization , which has dispatched women field coordinators to the 83 voting districts with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One such coordinator is Nabila Hassan Saleh , who works out of her village near Taiz , a bustling mountain city about 100 miles south of Sanaa . Draped from head to toe in black cloth , Saleh meets regularly with local women to explain the basics of democracy . <p> Saleh and another , similarly attired coordinator , Samira Khassem Salem , recently invited a foreign visitor to sit in on a session under the watchful eye of Saleh 's elderly father in Saleh 's house . <p> At first , the listeners expressed befuddlement . " We are goatherds and women , " said Fatemah Gorham , a 35-year-old mother of eight in a bright red head scarf . " How can we vote ? We ca n't read and write . " <p> But the two women patiently pressed on . " You say you 're a goatherd , but you are human , " Salem told Gorham . " Do you have any demands ? " <p> " I want cheap sugar , I want low prices , " Gorham replied , warming to the topic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , education . " <p> " The man you vote for , ask him , ' What will you do for me when you go to parliament ? ' " Salem urged . <p> But another woman was doubtful as she recalled her experience during the last parliamentary election . " They told us they would give us sugar and wheat , " she said , cradling a sleeping toddler . " We were so pleased that I took my daughters and we voted . But we did n't even get soap . "
