<p> ORCHARD PARK , N.Y .  --  Amid last-minute , game-day preparations last Sunday , Buffalo Bills coach Marv Levy put in a call to Buffalo General Hospital to check on his assistant head coach and running backs guru , Elijah Pitts . <p> Pitts has been hospitalized for several days while having tests , but in addition to getting an update on his condition , Levy wanted input for planning substitution patterns vs. the Detroit Lions . <p> In previous weeks , Levy delegated to Pitts the delicate task of determining when to use Thurman Thomas and emerging rookie Antowain Smith . But with Pitts out , Levy needed a better feel himself . <p> " I said , ' How did you handle it , Eli ? ' " Levy remembers . <p> " He said , ' Thurman handled it . ' " <p> In the competitive , sometimes cutthroat world of the NFL , the suggestion that a player showing signs of decline would be allowed such a heavy say in a game-management matter ( particularly when Smith demonstrates a prowess for producing long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also demonstrates a tremendous respect coaches have for Thomas , whose 14,959 career all-purpose yards are ninth on the NFL 's all-time list . <p> Thomas , 31 , has n't averaged 4 yards a carry in five seasons , but they trust him enough to allow him to put himself in and out of games . <p> " I talked to him early in the season , " says Levy . " Told him we 'd relieve him more . " <p> Says Thomas : " My ego 's not as big as people think . I 'm willing to sacrifice for the team . " <p> During a 37-35 victory vs . Indianapolis on Sept. 21 , when Smith 's three-touchdown , 129-yard day included a 54-yard TD jaunt in the fourth quarter , Thomas seemed ready to hand over his starting job . <p> Smith says Thomas came to him on the sideline and said , " You 're starting . " <p> Yet this is where Levy exercises his authority . Despite Smith 's fresh legs , Levy will start Thomas for Sunday 's game at New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , continue starting Thomas for the rest of the season . <p> And there are other pre-planned patterns : In passing situations with three-receiver , one-back formations , Levy still wants Thomas ( the Bills ' second-leading receiver with 20 catches ) in the game because of his soft hands and precise routes . When power-rushing schemes are needed , such as for clock-killing drives , the coach wants the 6-2 , 224-pound Smith carrying the ball . <p> " I 'm sure Thurman would like to play more , " says Levy . " But I think he 's older and wiser . He knows he can be more effective when he 's fresh . He knows he 's established his reputation as a great player . And I think he knows his body ca n't take 300 carries a year anymore . " <p> After nine years with Thomas as the focal point of the backfield , the evolution is in full swing . The Bills drafted Smith from the University of Houston in April with the 23rd pick in the first round . He quickly established himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on a play dubbed " 37 Zone , " Smith blew through a hole created by Reuben Brown . He cut past a blitzing linebacker and outran cornerback Bryant Westbrook for a 54-yard TD that sealed a 22-13 victory . <p> It was the latest example of why so many callers to the radio talk shows in Buffalo and some critics figure it 's time for the passing of the torch . <p> " People here in the Buffalo area feel like that 's why this guy should be starting , " Thomas said earlier this week . " The only way I 'd have a problem with what people say is if me and Antowain had a problem , and we do n't . " <p> Still , it seems to sting Thomas a bit to hear fans and critics so willing to write him off . <p> " I saw that happen last year with Jim Kelly , " Thomas said of the former Bills quarterback , who retired this year after a subpar 1996 season . " He got off to a horrible start , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buffalo . I ca n't let it bother me . Just because they say bad things about me , they are not going to run me out of here . I 'm going to leave on my own terms . " <p> Thomas says he 's in a year-to-year mode in pondering retirement . Until he does retire , Smith figures he 'll absorb as many nuances from Thomas as possible . <p> Along the way , though , it 's tough to ignore Smith 's numbers . He 's averaged 6.1 yards a carry . With 349 yards on 57 carries , has been outrushed by just one rookie , Tampa Bay 's Warrick Dunn . <p> With one fewer carry , Thomas averages 3.4 yards a rush . Smith has led the Bills in rushing in each of four games . <p> " It 's best to be patient , " says Smith . " I know my wait is not long before I 'm in the starting lineup . Whether that 's one or two years down the road , who knows ? I just want to contribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special teams , I just do n't want them to feel like , ' Oh , he 's another first-rounder that we 've squandered . ' " <p> Credit Smith for showing his elder some respect . After Sunday 's game  --  during which Thomas ' 24-yard run in the fourth quarter preceeded a Chris Mohr punt that led to a go-ahead safety  --  Smith was quick to low-key his own accomplishments . Yes , it 's a harmonious 1-2 punch . <p> " Besides the one big run , Antowain Smith was basically non-existent , " Smith said . " Today was Thurman 's day . He set the tone , and it was great to see because he 's been taking so much abuse . People saying , ' He 's too old , ' or ' He needs to pass the torch . ' <p> " Sure , being a competitor , you always want to start , " he added . " It would n't be natural if I did n't want to . But I know my role right now . They are grooming me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be ready . " <p> Running back shuffle in Buffalo <p> Thurman Thomas is admittedly nearing the end of an illustrious career . Meanwhile , rookie Antowain Smith has served notice that the Bills ' running game could be left in very capable hands . They are splitting time during the transition .
