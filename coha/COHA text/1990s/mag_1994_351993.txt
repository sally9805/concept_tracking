Two weeks ago , when the first signs of a new Cuban exodus began appearing , TIME layout artist Edel Rodriguez decided to review the magazine 's 1980 coverage of the Mariel boatlift . He expected some of the images to look familiar . But he was stunned to discover an account by correspondent Richard Woodbury of the voyage of the shrimper Nature Boy from Mariel to Florida . " I said , ' My God ! ' " Rodriguez recalls . " ' That was my boat ! ' " <P> For Bill Clinton , " Mariel " is shorthand for all that must be avoided this time around : another 125,000 new Florida residents courtesy of Fidel Castro . Rodriguez 's associations are more personal . He was eight when soldiers came to his family 's door in the town of El Gabriel and told them to clear out . An aunt in Hialeah , accepting Fidel 's open invitation , had sent a boat for her relatives . Rodriguez remembers his father , a photographer , ceding their home and possessions to the state . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quickly erected processing center . On board Nature Boy , in addition to 27 Rodriguez kin , the regime had placed several American journalists and 50 other strangers , some of them released prisoners . Edel 's father warily stayed awake all night ; young Edel slept through the voyage . <P> On arrival in Miami he recalls being mystified by toothpaste , apples and English . But he soon adapted . In high school he won a TIME-sponsored art scholarship by creating a hypothetical cover for the magazine . Later , another stipend enabled him to attend Brooklyn 's Pratt Institute where he majored in painting . Graduated just two months ago , Rodriguez designs our Letters , Contents and To Our Readers pages ( including this one ) . TIME has also used his illustrations . <P> Now an American citizen , Rodriguez , 23 , returned to Cuba for the first time last December . He was shocked by the smallness of the house he thought so large as a child , and by the simplicity of Cuban life , as well as by its tension and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as they got the chance they 'd be out of there . " He believes them : two cousins have arrived in the U.S. by raft in the past five years . <P> Rodriguez grudgingly supports the Clinton Administration policy of detaining Cuban refugees at Guantanamo , on the ground that they should not be granted privileges denied to Haitians . But he fails to see why deserving members of both groups should not be allowed to follow in his own successful wake . " I 've driven across the U.S. , " he says , " and there 's plenty of space . "
