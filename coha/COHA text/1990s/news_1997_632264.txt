<p> AMISTAD ( STAR ) ( STAR ) ( STAR ) <p> Theodore Joadson Morgan Freeman <p> Cinque Djimon Hounsou <p> John Quincy Adams Anthony Hopkins <p> Roger Baldwin Matthew McConaughey <p> Martin Van Buren Nigel Hawthorne <p> Directed by Steven Spielberg . Written by David Franzoni . Running time : 145 minutes . Rated R ( scenes of slavery and brutality ) . Opening today at local theaters . <p> Slavery could , I suppose , be seen largely as a matter of laws and property  --  at least to those benefitting from it . One of the astonishing facts revealed in Steven Spielberg 's " Amistad " is that seven of the nine U.S. Supreme Court justices in 1839 were slave-owning Southerners . His new film centers on the legal status of Africans who rise up against their captors on the high seas and are brought to trial in a New England court . Slavery itself is not the issue . Instead , the court must decide whether the defendants were born of slaves ( in which case they are guilty of murder ) or were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to defend themselves against kidnapping ) . <p> This legal distinction is not made as clear as it could have been ; the international slave trade had been outlawed by treaties by 1839 , the year of the landmark Amistad incident , but those who were already slaves remained the property of their masters  --  as did their children . The moral hair-splitting underlying that distinction is truly depraved , but on it depends the defense of Cinque , the leader of the Africans , and his fellow mutineers . <p> The film opens on the ship Amistad , where Cinque ( Djimon Hounsou ) is able to free himself from shackles and release his fellow prisoners . They rise up against the Spanish crew of the ship , which is taking them from a Havana slave market to another destination in Cuba . The two men who bought them are spared , and promise to guide the ship back to Africa . But they guide it instead into U.S. waters , and the Africans find themselves in an American court . <p> Luckily , it is a Northern court , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are unlucky at first with their defense team , which is led by Roger Baldwin ( Matthew McConaughey ) , a real estate lawyer who bases his case on property law and only slowly comes to see his clients as human beings . The cause is supported by two Boston abolitionists , a former slave named Joadson ( Morgan Freeman ) and an immigrant named Tappan ( Stellan Skarsgard ) . And eventually , on appeal , former President John Quincy Adams ( Anthony Hopkins ) argues eloquently for the freedom of the men . <p> " Amistad , " like Spielberg 's " Schindler 's List , " is not simply an argument against immorality . We do not need movies to convince us of the evil of slavery and the Holocaust . Both films are about the ways good men try to work realistically within an evil system to spare a few of its victims . Schindler 's strategies are ingenious and suspenseful , and lead to a more gripping and powerful film than the legal tactics in " Amistad , " where lawyers in powdered wigs try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak . <p> Entirely apart from the moral issues involved , " Schindler 's List " works better as narrative because it is about a risky deception , while " Amistad " is about the search for a truth that , if found , will be small consolation to the millions of existing slaves . As a result , the movie does n't have the emotional charge of Spielberg 's earlier film  --  or of " The Color Purple , " which moved me to tears . <p> The moments of greatest emotion in " Amistad " stand outside the main story . They include a horrifying scene where , with food running low on the ship , the weaker captives are chained together and thrown over the side to drown so that more food will be left for the rest . And another sequence in which the mechanics of the slave trade are examined , as Africans capture members of enemy tribes and sell them to slave traders . A scene where Cinque sees African violets in John Quincy Adams ' greenhouse and is seized with homesickness . And Cinque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is most valuable about " Amistad " is the way it provides faces and names for its African characters , whom the movies so often make into faceless victims . The captive called Cinque emerges as a powerful individual , a once-free farmer who has lost his wife and family . We see his wife , and his village , and something of his life ; we understand how cruelly he was ripped from his life and ambitions . ( Since it was the policy of slavery to destroy African families , these scenes are especially poignant . ) <p> He speaks no English , but learns a little while in prison , and a translator is found who helps him express his dismay at a legal system that may free him but will not affirm the true nature of the crime against him . He learns enough of Western civilization to see its contradictions , as in a scene where a fellow captive uses an illustrated Bible to explain how he can identify with Jesus . And there is a touching scene between lawyer and client in which Joadson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a piece in a puzzle . " Give us free ! " Cinque cries in a powerful moment in the courtroom , indicating how irrelevant a " not guilty " verdict would be to the real facts of his case . <p> Djimon Hounsou 's performance depends largely on his screen presence , which is formidable . Some of the other performances are disappointing . I was surprised how little importance or screen time was given to the Morgan Freeman character , who in his few scenes indicates the volumes that remain concealed . <p> Matthew McConaughey 's character is necessarily unfocused as the defense attorney ; he proceeds from moral blindness to a light that surprises no one , and while we are happy for him we are not , under the circumstances , much moved . <p> Nigel Hawthorne plays President Martin Van Buren , who is portrayed as a spineless compromiser who wants only to keep the South off his back ; the character is played in the same note as his pathetic old George III in " The Madness of King George , " when more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the film , really , is in Anthony Hopkins ' powerful performance as old John Quincy Adams , who speaks for 11 minutes in defense of the defendants , and holds the courtroom ( and the audience ) spellbound . It is one of the great movie courtroom speeches . But in praising it , I touch on the film 's great weakness : It is too much about the law and not enough about the victims . <p> Ever since Spielberg began " Amistad , " the story has been hyped and hailed as a great untold chapter in American history , an event to put beside Nat Turner 's uprising . The story of Cinque certainly deserves more attention in textbooks , but it is not an ideal story to make into a film ; Nat Turner would have been a better choice for Spielberg . That John Quincy Adams wins his big case is a great achievement for him and a great relief for Cinque and his fellow captives , but in the sad annals of American slavery , it is a rather hollow triumph .
