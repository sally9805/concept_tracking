The hard-liners ' coup is history , but one ominous fact remains : the Soviet nuclear arsenal contains some 27,000 warheads scattered through several republics . Who will now control them ? During the three days of Gorbachev 's confinement , his so-called football  --  the satchel containing launch- authorization codes  --  was in the hands of the junta , raising concerns that its leaders might , in desperation , do something rash . And now , with at least the partial breakup of the U.S.S.R. a certainty , fears are growing that some of the seceding republics may insist that the weapons remain on their soil , in effect creating a new nuclear power with every declaration of independence . Wondered French government spokesman Jack Lang last week : " Will every republic have at its disposal a little atomic bomb , some of them equivalent to one or two Hiroshimas ? " <P> Most experts , though , believe the threat of atomic war was minimal during the coup and will probably remain so even if the Union dissolves . One reason is that virtually all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bomber-borne kinds that threaten other nations  --  are in just four republics : Russia , Ukraine , Belorussia and Kazakhstan . <P> Of the four , Russia holds 80% or more of the strategic nukes . So far , the actions of Russian President Boris Yeltsin concerning the weapons have been reassuring . He insisted late last week that " any division of strategic weapons among the republics is unequivocally ruled out . " Yeltsin also said he and Gorbachev will convene a meeting of national security officials , including those from the republics , to discuss control of Soviet nuclear weapons . Yeltsin favors sharing control between the central government and the republics  --  a policy that would make the chances of an ill-advised nuclear attack even less likely than they were before the coup . <P> Two other republics with strategic nukes have gone still further toward yielding control . Both Ukraine and Belorussia have proclaimed themselves nuclear-free zones , and Kazakhstan 's President Nursultan Nazarbayev decreed the closing of the underground nuclear testing center at Semipalatinsk , though he has not yet agreed to give up the weapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , is that the Soviet Union 's system of nuclear command and control has at least as many checks and balances as the U.S. 's , and perhaps more . Says Michael Dewar , deputy director of London 's International Institute for Strategic Studies : " There are several stages , an intricate system of codes and identifications , before nuclear weapons can be fired from the ground , from airplanes or from submarines . " The system provides for two " footballs , " while the U.S. has but one . To ready nuclear warheads for a launch , the codes from both footballs  --  one in the hands of the head of state and the other from the Minister of Defense  --  must be mated in the headquarters of the general staff . The combined codes would then be sent as an encrypted message down the chain of command to the operating forces . The final step in launching a missile is the turning of two separate keys simultaneously ; again in common with U.S. procedures , the Soviet crewmen are separated by about 10 ft. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missile singlehandedly . The system for submarines is somewhat different , but again there are strict safeguards .
