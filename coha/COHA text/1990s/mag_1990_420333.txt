Section : U.S. News Budget war <p> Congress 's inability to make tough choices threatens the economy <p> Forget the daily headlines about whether there 's a functioning government or not . In reality , it 's as busted as Skylab . And Washington 's paralysis over cutting the nation 's projected $293.7 billion budget deficit is menacing the basic health of the nation . While officials debated into the weekend about whether to shut down parts of the government , the truth is that a crisis of leadership already exists in the capital . <p> Watching the nation 's leaders in inaction , it might be hard to believe that there 's a pretty sensible - and politically passable - deal to be struck to end the budget impasse . Here it is : Cut medicare payments to doctors and hospitals and raise payroll taxes on the well-to-do ; lower capital-gains taxes and increase tax rates on the wealthy . This is not rocket science . It would give President Bush and Democrats each something they care about , and it would require that they give up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold to the basic framework negotiated by Bush and Democrats of a five-year deal to cut $500 billion from the deficit . Whether they could agree upon it at the leadership level and then sell it to rebellious backbenchers is not a sure thing . That 's not the way things happen any more in this season of fecklessness in Washington . <p> Bush and a bipartisan group of lawmakers had hoped the battle was easing as they announced a deal on September 30 . But the package fell victim in the House to majorities in both parties who most of all hated the proposed $60 billion medicare-premium increases and cuts in payments to doctors and hospitals . On a lesser level , they also objected to the fact that the deal disproportionately hurt the poor and middle class with a series of excise taxes on gasoline , heating oil , cigarettes and beer . The process of writing a deficit-reduction plan now passes to an anarchic gaggle of congressional panels that have never been terribly serious about cutting costs and raising taxes . " They essentially voted for chaos , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man many contend masterminded the deficit mess to change the nature of government spending . <p> Rising pressure . Now , government is prostrate . And the implications for the economy are profound . The coming year 's deficit will be larger than last year 's because of the slowing economy , the substantial new costs of the Desert Shield operation in the Persian Gulf and the extra billions added each month to cover the S &L; bailout . Without determined action to scale back spending or raise revenues , the exploding borrowing needs are adding to pressures on interest rates . And higher rates will create more pain in an economy now almost surely in recession . Government figures last week showed that unemployment had risen to 5.8 percent . More significantly , nonfarm payroll declined by 101,000 jobs as both the manufacturing and service sectors of the economy saw jobs evaporate . " The economy is crying out for lower interest rates , ' says Robert Brusca , chief economist for Nikko Securities . <p> Washington 's failure to show any appreciation for that peril also suggested that lawmakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feckless incumbents . What they did take seriously was constituent anger at specific provisions of the deficit deal . The President was unable to stem the tide during his unprecedented - for him - prime-time-television appeal for the package . " If we fail to enact this agreement , our economy will falter , markets may tumble and recession will follow , ' he declared as he asked listeners to phone their support to lawmakers . Phone they did , but in unusually high numbers against the deal . And his Republican troops in the House responded by voting overwhelmingly against their own leader 's plan by 105 to 71 . Noting that Bush 's case had been supported on TV by Senate Democratic Leader George Mitchell , a Republican strategist lamented : " The Establishment walked arm in arm off the cliff . ' <p> It was the worst defeat of Bush 's Presidency and is likely to carry forward in important ways . Before the House vote , Bush predicted to friends that his pals on Capitol Hill would " do the right thing " by passing the deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his handling of the Persian Gulf crisis . But Bush 's popularity seems untransferable . One recent batch of GOP polls showed that if Bush campaigned in a typical congressional district , 11 percent of the voters would be more inclined to support the candidate the President backed , but 9 percent said Bush 's presence would incline them against the candidate . <p> Bush 's aides suggest now he will rarely attempt Reagan-like , rally-the-nation speeches on domestic political issues . Instead , he 'll revert to his preferred insider 's game of wooing lawmakers one at a time in personal settings . <p> Even if he does decide to lead future charges , the White House lobbying operation proved so inept on this crucial issue that it 's not likely to be more effective on lesser issues . White House Chief of Staff John Sununu alienated members of Congress when he told a House GOP caucus that " George Bush is going to stand on a platform with you in your district and ask you how you 're going to vote ' on the budget deal . He particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " insignificant " when Lott announced he opposed the deal . When Vice President Dan Quayle called Lott to smooth things over , the senator barked : " You know this is a bunch of crap . So do n't try to sell it . ' <p> But a budget must still be passed . What became clear in last week 's skirmishes were the basic disputes that will dominate debate for the rest of this year and likely for years to come . In addition to partisan fights over programs , there are larger economic issues at stake as Washington considers : <p> The size of the deal . The biggest argument in favor of the defeated plan was that it was the most credible way to start tackling the deficit for two reasons . First , the deficit targets embraced by the budget-summit negotiators were sufficiently large to convince financial markets that the country was coming to grips with its profligate borrowing . That would prompt Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan to allow interest rates to come down , boosting the sagging economy . Second , those targets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuts needed to meet them would put the economy into much further trouble . <p> That 's not to say the overall strategy would work as advertised . Even in this conscientiously crafted package , there were some of Washington 's standard tricks . The economic assumptions underlying Bush 's plan were more than rosy : They assumed that beyond 1992 , the economy would barrel along at a faster rate than in the ' 60s , while enjoying the lowest inflation and interest rates since the 1950s . The plan also assumed that the Internal Revenue Service would bring in $3 billion extra by conducting more tax audits - a windfall that is unlikely to materialize this year . It takes more than a year to hire and train the extra agents needed to ferret out the tax dodgers . And user fees such as $25 boat stickers , which the Bush plan counted on for $14 billion , are routinely included in deficit-cutting bills and just as routinely disappear . <p> Under more realistic assumptions , even a decent deal wo n't have the impact on the deficit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and political circumstances , the deficit will still be in the $150 billion range by 1993 and leveling out , say experts at DRI/McGraw-Hill , an economic forecasting firm . A mild recession could push the deficit to over $300 billion in 1992 . In the event of a deeper recession - not likely by DRI 's thinking - the deficit could balloon to more than $400 billion . <p> The future of medicare . It 's the biggest battleground . The Bush administration originally sought to slice $110 billion from the program over the next five years , but budget negotiators eventually settled on just $60 billion in cuts . While half the savings would have come from lower payments to hospitals and doctors , much of the rest was to come out of the pockets of medicare 's 33 million beneficiaries through higher deductibles , premiums and co-payments for such procedures as laboratory testing . Moreover , these measures would have hit the low and middle-income elderly the hardest - generating a massive seniors ' rebellion . <p> Yet if a budget-cutting agreement is eventually struck , it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promising alternative plan is being pushed by Democratic Representative Pete Stark of California , among others . It targets hospitals , doctors and better-off beneficiaries . Under the proposal , physicians and hospitals would face $32 billion in cuts through 1995 , in large part by holding down projected increases in their payments to compensate for inflation . An additional $28 billion would come from individuals . But hikes in medicare premiums and deductibles would be far lower than under the original agreement : For example , the deductible beneficiaries must incur before being covered for physicians ' services would rise from $75 to $100 , instead of climbing in stages to $150 by 1993 . <p> Still more important , $18 billion in further savings would come from shifting more of the burden of financing medicare to the working-age population . Currently , workers contribute 1.45 percent of their annual earnings to medicare , up to a wage ceiling of $51,300 ; the original budget agreement would have lifted the ceiling to $73,500 . Democrats now propose lifting it to $150,000 , making the medicare portion of the payroll tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppose such a drastic payroll-tax hike as a roundabout way of raising taxes on the rich . As a result , lawmakers and the administration will face only dismal choices among several nasty alternatives such as cutting politically sacrosanct Social Security . <p> How much to focus on the rich . The near-universal howls of outrage at the summit deal were the best evidence that the plan spread the pain broadly . The overwhelming sentiment in the House was to skew the next deal more against the rich . That will prompt Democrat-dominated congressional tax committees to renew attempts to raise tax rates for the rich - an idea that was also gaining ground among some moderate Republicans . However , a significant rate hike risks a presidential veto . Any new plan will probably embrace limits on itemized deductions of individuals with incomes over $100,000 - the higher the income , the higher the limit . <p> Yet the partisan posturing on the regressive features of the summiteers ' plan was overblown . Many of their tax proposals have been recommended for years , partly because they raise significant revenues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't helpful to consume : Cigarettes , beer , wine , liquor and gasoline . In the new efforts to cut the deficit , it 's likely some of the proposed excise taxes will survive , in part because voters consistently tell pollsters they 'd rather pay excise taxes than higher income taxes . How stimulative the tax code can be . A last-minute deal between Bush and budget-summit negotiators to build " growth incentives " into the package has revived the debate over how to use the tax code to encourage investment . These incentives for small companies drew Democrats ' ire largely because of fears they would inadvertently revive the tax-shelter industry that had died after the 1986 tax reform . Similar breaks have not worked well in other countries . The pact also embraced special breaks for the oil-and-gas industry that have never proven particularly effective . Bush will not approve a deal that can not be sold as pro-growth , so future deliberations will have to provide something . How to use user fees . The most intriguing new policy embraced by Bush and congressional leaders was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excise taxes - and to apply a large portion of the revenues to cut the deficit , rather than depositing them , say , in the highway and airport trust funds . That principle will almost surely be kept in any future budget deal , much to the dismay of truckers , airlines and others in the transportation industry . While using those funds to reduce the deficit would have a salutary impact on the overall economy , some economists fear it would encourage more neglect of the nation 's transportation infrastructure . And others , like Robert Giordano , an economist with Goldman Sachs , argue that hiking user fees is inflationary because most of the higher excise taxes will be passed along to consumers . <p> The debate over all this probably wo n't be resolved till the wee hours of some weekend night several weeks hence , after the travails of several more real or manufactured crises . By the end of it all , the anti-incumbent fever might well be at the breaking point ; the drive to limit lawmakers ' terms peaking and the financial markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> By Harrison Raines <p> With Sylvia Nasar and Kenneth T.
