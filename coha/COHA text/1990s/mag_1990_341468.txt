Czechoslovakia 's Vaclav Havel was just an oppressed dissident playwright when he received an invitation last year to give the keynote address at the 1990 Salzburg music and drama festival . He accepted , figuring he would not be allowed to attend since the Communist government had not let him leave the country in many years . But now Havel is the government  --  and he had R.S.V.P.ed , after all . So off to Mozart 's birthplace the Czechoslovak President went last week , even if it did mean meeting his Austrian counterpart , Kurt Waldheim , thus breaching the international isolation imposed on the Austrian leader because of his dubious wartime past . <P> But if Waldheim thought he would get a p.r . windfall from Havel 's visit , he underestimated his man . Though a beaming Waldheim introduced Havel to the crowd in glowing terms , the playwright President did not return the compliment . Instead , using language that was indirect but clear enough , he verbally lacerated his opposite number , who for years concealed his service as an officer in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during World War II . Choosing the fear of history as his theme , Havel called " the expectation that one can glide through history unpunished and rewrite one 's own biography " one of " the traditional Central European delusions . " More pointedly , Havel declared , " Whoever fears to look his own past in the face must necessarily fear what is to come . Lies can not save us from lies . " Asked afterward whether Havel might have had him in mind , Waldheim was belligerent . " Certainly not , " he told Austrian TV . " I did not rewrite my biography . " <P> Denounced even by some of his staunchest followers for agreeing to associate with the ostracized Austrian , Havel plainly hoped his words would pacify his critics . He apparently saw to it that his friend Richard von Weizsacker , the West German President , also attended the festival 's opening , since Von Weizsacker is widely respected in Europe for his blunt acknowledgments of Germany 's blame for the Holocaust . Both leaders repeatedly emphasized that their visits were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they cut their stays short , leaving Austria within several hours of their arrival . Still , the visit enraged many Jews , four of whom , including American Rabbi Avi Weiss , were arrested for public disorder after they shouted at Waldheim before Havel spoke . <P> Since his election in 1986 , Waldheim has wooed only one other Western head of state to Austria , Cypriot President George Vassiliou , who visited Vienna in early July . With two years left in his term and with the boycott against him broken , Waldheim might yet have other callers . But after his encounter with Havel , he just might prefer his solitude.
