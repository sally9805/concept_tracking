<p> WHEN " RENT " OPENS tomorrow night at the Nederlander Theater on Broadway , it will arrive with all the accolades a show could hope for , from rave Off Broadway reviews to a Pulitzer Prize . That should be enough , its producers and fans hope , to make a success of a musical-theater work that is not a revival , a movie adaptation , a Stephen Sondheim opus or an Andrew Lloyd Webber spectacular . " Rent , " as a rock opera , also carries a different set of aspirations  --  that Broadway can find common ground with composers and fans of the world 's most popular music . <p> Rock has n't been entirely absent from Broadway , of course . During its two-year run , " Tommy , " the stage adaptation of the Who 's 1969 rock opera , proved that power chords were safe for Broadway . Yet " Tommy , " a full-fledged rock opera , is also a special case ; it was a huge hit when it first appeared as an album , and it had already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although it is very loosely based on Puccini 's " Boheme , " ca n't bank on a quarter-century of familiarity , and its tale of struggling artists , drug users and H.I.V.-positive lovers does n't revolve around special effects . <p> Broadway is happier with nostalgia : 1950's-style rock carries musicals like " Grease " and revues like " Smokey Joe 's Cafe . " Through the years , Broadway has made a place for the Motown-style songs of " Dreamgirls , " the light funk of " The Wiz " and the would-be rock anthems of " Jesus Christ Superstar , " " Godspell " and " Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat . " ( The last three were most specifically aimed at proselytizing a young audience and had the box-office insurance of church groups . ) <p> For decades , the Broadway musical thrived on integrating tinges of down-home American or exotic foreign styles into what was then the pop mainstream . Composers borrowed from country in " Oklahoma ! , " Asian music in " The King and I , " klezmer in " Fiddler on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Broadway has been able to stave off rock 's influence , given the built-in propensity of composers to soak up all the music in the air ; even in contemporary classical music , there are composers who wield electric guitars and respect rock 's sonic vocabulary . Yet Broadway 's general reaction to rock has not changed much since the 1960 musical that satirized Elvis Presley , " Bye Bye Birdie " : mockery , disdain , bewilderment and a touch of envy . <p> Rock , that show implied , was for hormonally addled teen-agers ; Broadway was for adults , and lowbrows could stay home . But now that rock is into its 40 's , producers in search of a younger audience  --  if not teen-agers , then adults who grew up on rock  --  would be grateful if " Rent " gave Broadway some of rock 's drawing power . <p> It does n't seem impossible ; in many ways , rock and Broadway have converged in their love of spectacle . Broadway may have steered clear of rock for much of the 1950 's and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , it has overlapped with musical theater . <p> To the dismay of traditionalists , Broadway musicals now regularly use amplification and electronic instruments , and many have picked up rock 's razzle-dazzle of lights , video effects and pyrotechnics , even if the music is as neo-Romantic as the score of " Sunset Boulevard . " Meanwhile , to fulfill expectations that music videos have built , rock concerts by the likes of Madonna and Janet Jackson are song-and-dance extravaganzas , relying on the same kinds of expertise that were once concentrated in the theater . <p> But Broadway 's longtime condescension to rock musicians meant that a generation or two of potential theater composers took its talents elsewhere . And the commercial center of popular music moved from the theater to the electronic media a half century ago , and Broadway has become a small pond . A rock composer can enjoy far more cultural impact , and cash flow , via music video and the arena circuit .

Yet Broadway 's genteel distaste for rock 's noise and rawness has excluded stories that are now heard not just in rock songs but in performance art , comedy and films . Rappers from L. L. Cool J. to Tupac Shakur deliberately fabricate larger-than-life characters in the audio dramas of their albums . <p> And rock songwriters , consciously or not , construct theatrical images in and around their songs , sometimes using celebrity the way theatrical leads use the spotlight . What character on Broadway could be more flamboyant , unpredictable , funny and sometimes wrenching than Courtney Love ? <p> While most rock composers still build their projects one isolated song at a time , a sizable minority have been intrigued by the idea of creating a coherent , evening-length work with multiple characters . But most of them have bypassed the Broadway gantlet of backers and producers , cast auditions and out-of-town tryouts . They have simply gone into the studio and recorded concept albums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to call their extended structures . <p> " The Who 's ' Tommy ' " is the best-known rock opera , but hardly the only one . It 's just that rock operas tend to be staged on the concert circuit or between a listener 's ears , not on the Great White Way . English rockers , beginning with the Kinks , have been especially fond of the idea of rock operas . The 1970 's brought four different concept album/operas from the Kinks as well as David Bowie 's Ziggy Stardust production , Genesis ' " Lamb Lies Down on Broadway " and Pink Floyd 's two arena spectaculars , " The Dark Side of the Moon " and " The Wall . " Instead of orchestras , there were electric guitars ; the parts were sung by band members rather than hired actors . <p> As for American rock operas , Frank Zappa recorded ( but never fully staged ) " Joe 's Garage " in 1980 ; Styx came up with " Kilroy Was Here " in 1983 and built a tour around it .

And seasoned pop and rock composers have lately been drawn to the idea of stage productions , perhaps as an alternative to the grueling routine of tours . Paul Simon has a musical-theater project in the works , and " Randy Newman 's ' Faust ' " was staged last year in La Jolla , Calif . Yoko Ono wrote and recorded a musical-theater work called " New York Rock " that was staged Off Broadway in 1994 . <p> " Rent " has drawn comparisons to the bellwether of rock musicals , " Hair , " which was , like " Rent , " populated by characters on the city 's scruffy fringe . In the late 1960 's setting of " Hair , " that meant hippies and draft dodgers ; in the 1990 's of " Rent , " it means gay people , artist-squatters , drug addicts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters for a Broadway show , but rock listeners ( or prime-time television viewers ) wo n't be too shocked . A greater challenge for " Rent " will be to hold on to the site-specific charm of its Lower East Side production in a bigger Broadway theater . <p> While " Rent " does have a power chord or two , its musical heart is closer to Broadway than to the noise and dissonance of home-grown Lower East Side avant-rock . Jonathan Larson 's songs are good-hearted , tuneful and often witty , and their themes dovetail and recur deftly enough to earn their designation as an opera . But they 're not frighteningly contemporary ; they hold echoes of the Police , Warren Zevon and earnest mid-1970 's rock , no rougher than " Hair " or " Godspell . " <p> Roger , the opera 's guitar-slinging , H.I.V.-positive hero , spends a year working on a song in a downtown slum , and it turns out to be a ballad that Phil Collins could sing .

Ticket prices are one stumbling block ; although concert prices are rising , too , rock fans can pay less money for more fun , while hanging out with people like themselves . Rock audiences are also likely to find that the artifice of the theater is at odds with the sincerity that rock performers project , even when that sincerity is heavily theatrical . <p> An attitude gap may be even more difficult to cross . Rock 's mythos has to do with the street ; Broadway chooses parlors and palaces . Judging by what is offered to them , audiences for musical theater demand upbeat endings ; even when the plot includes death or violence , the American musical is ( Sondheim notwithstanding ) an affirmation of love , family and community . Rock audiences cherish love songs , too , but they also thrill to music with transgressive impulses , exorcising ugliness by staring it down . <p> " Rent , " with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acutely conscious of its place between two artistic spheres .
