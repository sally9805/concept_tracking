Dead dark stage . A blast of Trumpets . Four ceremonially robed men enter and place a coffin on stage . The trumpets finish . HELEN enters wearing a ceremonial dress . SHE speaks to the audience . HELEN It 's been a month . I was with her when she died . Here in Whitehall , her servants have thrown the windows open to let in the spring air . All morning they 've been packing her dresses and moving out her furniture . The new king came last night by barge . This afternoon they 'll lower her coffin into the space they 've opened for her in Westminster Abbey . The nobles will break their lances and toss the broken pieces onto her coffin , meaning their vows to her are ended . They 'll return to Whitehall to carouse all night with the new king : James . My new Lady is waiting for me in the Queen 's chamber . She has called me to arrange her flowers and sweets . I do n't know whether I can go to her . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Tower . I do n't know whether there can ever be another Queen . Lights to dead dark . ALL exit , taking off coffin . Trumpets flourish . Lights rise . It is dusk . THE MASTER OF THE KEYS , THE LORD SECRETARY , KEEPER OF THE SEAL , and ARCHBISHOP are standing at attention on either side of the QUEEN , who holds court upstage in the center on a dais . A revolving mirror ball throws glitter around the audience . Banners flank her . SHE is dressed in a gorgeous , suffocating robe , ruff , and head dress . Her face is painted . SHE is elegant and witty , an electrifying presence . The audience flings flowers and small favors toward her . p. 3 ELIZABETH We thank our beloved people , who have long stood in the cold to hear our granting of petitions . We have well and truly heard your desires . Frail woman as we are , yet God has ordained us to be your Queen and here we renew our vows . For the safety of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to spend our blood . Applause and cheering . Cries of " Good Queen Bess " and " Gloriana " and " England 's Queen " , " Our Faerie Queene !

Since he has nothing to lose , he has fun , taking particular delight in parodying court manners . At the moment , HE stands watching the QUEEN . ELIZABETH And let us celebrate with all our hearts this night God 's goodness in granting us twenty-six years upon the throne of England to rule as his Queen over the most excellent subjects He ever made !

SHE begins sweeping up the flowers and other debris . DEVEREAUX Excuse me . HELEN looks up . DEVEREAUX I 've ridden all night . Do you have anything to eat ? There is a burlap bag among the debris . SHE pushes it with her foot . HELEN Just walnuts . DEVEREAUX I do n't like nuts . HELEN They 've eaten everything else . DEVEREAUX What 's your name ? HELEN Helen . Well , and Anna . And Genevieve . Or sometimes Penelope or Kathryn --  DEVEREAUX They 're all your names ? HELEN You never know which she 'll choose . p. 5 DEVEREAUX Do n't you get confused ? HELEN Only on the days she calls us all by the same name . DEVEREAUX Who ? HELEN The Queen . DEVEREAUX I mean who does she call ? HELEN Her waiting women . DEVEREAUX Ah , you 're waiting . What for ?

SHE finds a nutcracker and gives it to him . HE cracks the nuts and eats them as they talk . p. 6 DEVEREAUX Where I come from , everybody has a different name . What shall I call you ? HELEN Helen 's fine . DEVEREAUX That 's simple enough . She ca n't remember Helen ? HELEN She 's busy . DEVEREAUX So busy she ca n't remember your name ? HELEN She ca n't know everyone 's . She is the Queen of England . DEVEREAUX So she should be clever enough to remember a few names . HELEN She 's preoccupied . DEVEREAUX Then how 's she going to beat Spain ? HELEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't object if she remembered my name . DEVEREAUX Do you think she cares what your name is ? To her , the main thing is being the Virgin Queen . HELEN How do you know ? DEVEREAUX If she is n't having herself rowed down the Thames to music , she 's giving a speech or riding through the streets in her gilded carriage . HELEN That 's what a Queen does . p. 7 DEVEREAUX I hear she decks herself out in jewels , so when she catches the light , she looks like the sun . And this new poet , Spenser , has been sitting around in some castle in Ireland for eight years , grinding out a poem that styles her as Gloriana , the greatest Monarch since the world began . HELEN She did n't tell him to . DEVEREAUX But I suppose she 'll pay him a fortune for it . HELEN She likes to read . DEVEREAUX With all the rhetoric and puffery , how can a normal person tell what 's what ? HELEN What 's wrong with a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'll start calling it in about fifty years . They 'll look back at it and mistake all this ballyhoo for history . Well , not me . I 'm not getting sucked in . HELEN If you do n't like court , why did you come ? DEVEREAUX That reminds me ! Where 's Walter Raleigh ? HELEN Sir Tobacco ? Probably at the theater , throwing his cloak over a puddle . DEVEREAUX Where is the theater ? HELEN Very close . p. 8 DEVEREAUX ( Moving to exit ) Excuse me . I need to find him . HELEN I hope you 're not planning to fight . DEVEREAUX How do you know what I 'm thinking ? HELEN Because everyone does . DEVEREAUX Know what I 'm thinking ? HELEN Everyone fights with Sir Walter . But you 'd better not . DEVEREAUX Why ? HELEN She only allows pretend fighting at court . DEVEREAUX Why ? HELEN So we do n't all kill one another off . DEVEREAUX What good is pretend fighting ? HELEN She says it 's practice . DEVEREAUX For what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for real fighting . DEVEREAUX It must be practice for war ! HELEN She does n't approve of war . He offers her a walnut . p. 9 HELEN No thank you . DEVEREAUX You seem to know her pretty well . HELEN I do her face . First the rooster , then the drawing back of the curtain , then slippers , slip , bodice . Then me . DEVEREAUX I hear she wears a frightful amount of face paint . HELEN It has a caustic in it , you know , that pocks the skin , so the more you wear , the more you need . But she ca n't go without it now . That 's how the people recognize her . DEVEREAUX You 've seen her with it off ? HELEN Every morning and every night . HE has left off eating walnuts to watch her . HELEN By the way , never talk like this around her guards . DEVEREAUX Like what ? HELEN Loose talk . DEVEREAUX The truth . HELEN Did you hear me ? Or you 'll get us both in trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we think . HELEN Well , think again . This is London . Even an accent can ruin you . If you sound Catholic , the Protestants get you and if you sound Protestant , the Catholics get you . p. 10 DEVEREAUX So she 's a tyrant , too ! HELEN If it were n't for her , they 'd have killed one another off already . I thought everyone in England knew that . DEVEREAUX ( Beat ) Do you know who I am ? HELEN No . DEVEREAUX Are n't you curious ? HELEN A lot of people come and go . DEVEREAUX Men , I suppose . HELEN Half of them . DEVEREAUX The half you know ? HELEN Not in that way . DEVEREAUX Perhaps I 'll enjoy my stay at court . HELEN I hope it 's very brief . DEVEREAUX I do n't like places that are phony . HELEN Good ! DEVEREAUX Good . HELEN Good ! DEVEREAUX  - -  bye . Good bye ! He hands her the nutcracker and begins to exit left . He stops and snaps his fingers . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . HELEN gazes after him , then finishes sweeping . ALICE hurries in with broom . ALICE I 'm sorry , Love . They kept me on duty . HELEN Simon 's friend gave me a message for you . ALICE He did ! How thoughtful of him ! HELEN hands her the note . ALICE ( Reading ) No . My God ! The guards have taken him . When ? HELEN Yesterday night . Just after you left . ALICE Did he say anything ? HELEN He has n't located the song . ALICE What does that mean , he has n't located the song ? HELEN I do n't know . ALICE They 're questioning him . HELEN It 's code , you mean . ALICE Yes . Why are they questioning him ? HELEN Rebecca said they think he tried to poison the Queen . ALICE No ! HELEN embraces her . ALICE exits . HELEN exits after her . THE QUEEN enters still dressed in her Ascension Day robes , minus her crown and some of her jewelry . p. 12 ELIZABETH Guard . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raleigh has been fighting again . GUARD Indeed , I hear they 've just put him in the Tower . ELIZABETH Tell Walshingham to let him out . And bring me the young man who mauled him . GUARD Your Grace . Guard exits . ELIZABETH paces , reading , BURLEIGH enters . There is deep affection between them . ELIZABETH My dear Lord Burleigh , the morning shines brighter for your presence . BURLEIGH You are kind , Greatness . The Ambassador from Spain demands your answer . ELIZABETH Remind , me , Spirit , what is the question . BURLEIGH As you well know , you must decide whether to marry Philip . He is outraged by these years you have delayed . His Ambassador would not even attend your Ascension Day Tilt . ELIZABETH As a brother-in-law Philip was admirable , but it will take more time to ponder him as husband . BURLEIGH My Lady , you are the only one who seems not to understand that Philip wishes to secure his place in heaven by carrying out the Pope 's order to kill you . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in him , Spirit ? Where is his sense of humor ? BURLEIGH He paid your pastry chef to poison you ! ELIZABETH Which pastry chef ? BURLEIGH Head chef . Named Simon . ELIZABETH Ah , the one who is famous for his custard pie . BURLEIGH That one . We arrested him this afternoon , at the Ascension Day Festivities . You might now be dead , Greatness ! ELIZABETH Indeed ! This is the sixteenth time Philip has tried to kill me ! How he must love me ! BURLEIGH You must not jest about it , Greatness . ELIZABETH When I jest , you must not fail to smile , Lord Burleigh . BURLEIGH Come , Lady . Philip ! To dally further will drive him to vengeance . ELIZABETH Suppose I marry him , Old Wisdom ? BURLEIGH Your Puritan subjects will move against your Court . They will not watch the Catholic build bonfires with their children as he did when your sister was Queen . ELIZABETH The word from the north ? p. 14 BURLEIGH Expecting Philip to arrive as your consort , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that England must soon be split like a melon by war . ELIZABETH But give me your own counsel , kind Spirit . BURLEIGH Philip 's Ambassador packs for Spain . Whatever answer you have , you must give it now . ELIZABETH Beat . Tell him he must come to the dancing tonight . He must snack on kippered salmon with a silver fork . BURLEIGH Eating salmon , Greatness , is no reply to Philip 's marriage proposal . ELIZABETH The Ambassador might yet convince me to marry Philip . But not unless he is pleasant at dinner . If men must fight , it will be in the Tiltyard . If they would show their genius , let them discuss the stars . I will send men after Raleigh to find the new world . I have titles and coats of arms to give , yes , and my hand in marriage . To get anything , a man must put down his armor and come to Court . BURLEIGH How is this an answer to Philip ? ELIZABETH I will not negotiate with a man who threatens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Greatness . If you marry Philip , England will again turn Catholic . The Catholic God , the Puritan God , these are matters for war . p. 15 ELIZABETH Oh , come . Come . God is very big , is he not ? BURLEIGH They say he is . ELIZABETH Our people know that , sweet Burleigh . They do not fight over God , they fight over the church . Well , then , the church will have to be as big as God . It must stretch to take them all in . BURLEIGH How will you accomplish this ? ELIZABETH I steer a course so wide it will include them all . BURLEIGH Perhaps too wide , Greatness . Your people sometimes offend even without knowing it . ELIZABETH I know what you are after , gallant Spirit . BURLEIGH You must ban the old service and the devotions of Loyola . ELIZABETH It is hard to make a law against the worship of God . BURLEIGH Philip sends Jesuits to set your people against you . You must forbid them . ELIZABETH ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And forbid your subjects saying the old service in Latin . ( Beat ) You must , my Lady . Not against worship , against the old form . p. 16 ELIZABETH ( Beat ) Do it then . BURLEIGH On pain of death ? ELIZABETH ( Beat ) Yes , Old Wisdom . BURLEIGH I will tell Lord Walshingham . Even though today no man carried your arms in the Tiltyard , Greatness , the mere sight of you quelled their fighting ! ELIZABETH They know I love them dearly and would not have them hurt . BURLEIGH I have an idea , Sovereign . The people must see you everywhere . In the stars . In songs . You must sit for more portraits . ELIZABETH Have you noticed , Spirit , in these portraits and songs I never appear any older . It is lovely never to age , but perhaps not strictly accurate . BURLEIGH This motto of yours , Semper Eadem . Always the same . I will speak from my heart , Greatness . I worry that no one can keep such a promise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stars would spool down , the skies would come untacked from the heavens . I know that . There would be bloody war in England . I am content to remain the face my people have always known . Fixed at the center . Do not fear for England , careful Burleigh . Come , Spirit , let us start the dancing . p. 17 BURLEIGH Lady , I told the Spanish Ambassador I would return in an hour . ELIZABETH ( Smiling ) Well , tell him you can not . The Queen is being difficult ! BURLEIGH bows and exits . GUARD enters , pushing DEVEREAUX toward THE QUEEN . DEVEREAUX is still dressed in rustic . HE is an amiable , diffident , witty young man . GUARD My Lady , this is the scarecrow they pulled from Sir Walter . DEVEREAUX makes a simple country bow . The GUARD stands in formal attendance . ELIZABETH ( To DEVEREAUX ) Why will you not bow to the Queen ? DEVEREAUX I did bow . ELIZABETH You must bow properly . DEVEREAUX A country bow is proper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am from the country . ELIZABETH I will accept your apology . DEVEREAUX I did n't make one . ELIZABETH I am growing sorry that I asked to see you . p. 18 DEVEREAUX Why did you want to see me ? ELIZABETH I was curious . The thirteen men who preceded you in attempting to kill Raleigh are either dead or recovering , and --  DEVEREAUX ( Demonstrating )  - -  in another minute , I 'd have skewered him ! ELIZABETH ( Her first serious words ) Not in my court ! I trust you have understood me . ( More lightly ) Now please bow . HE makes a country bow . ELIZABETH ( With irony ) It appears you enjoyed the Tower . DEVEREAUX Where I read Sidney 's Astrophel and Stella . ELIZABETH You would like to go back ? DEVEREAUX I would n't mind a couple of years to work out that new Italian poem . ELIZABETH Do you think The Queen of England can support everyone who needs board and room ? I will NOT send you to the Tower ! DEVEREAUX Thank you . ELIZABETH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . ELIZABETH You 're clever . DEVEREAUX So . I pass ? ELIZABETH In fact , you would n't be bad looking if they put you in velvet . ( To the Guard ) Leave us ! GUARD My Lady ! ELIZABETH He wo n't touch the Queen , my good man . His wit is sharper than his sword . The GUARD bows and exits . ELIZABETH What brings you to my court ? DEVEREAUX I did not choose to come here . ELIZABETH You are free to leave . DEVEREAUX Forgive me , I 'm not . ELIZABETH What keeps you here ? DEVEREAUX Raleigh insulted my stepfather . ELIZABETH So your stepfather sent you to kill him . DEVEREAUX He knows how I love to fight . ELIZABETH What was his intention ? To have you killed ? DEVEREAUX Or perhaps that I should find a woman . p. 20 ELIZABETH To fight ? DEVEREAUX To marry . I inherited no money . ELIZABETH I will warn my women . Who is this devious stepfather ? DEVEREAUX Robert Dudley , Earl of Leicester . ELIZABETH Not Robin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robin ! The man who could not be faithful to a Virgin Queen ! First he hid his wife from me and now I find he has hidden a stepson . What is your name ? DEVEREAUX Robert Devereaux . ELIZABETH Ah ! I have heard of you ! No stepfather could make you come to court , Robert Devereaux . You dream of estates and titles . DEVEREAUX I dream of living on the land left me by my father . ELIZABETH It would be dangerous to follow in his footsteps . He died fighting in Ireland . DEVEREAUX For land which you gave him . ELIZABETH And which is still encumbered to me . DEVEREAUX Only ten thousand pounds I owe on it . ELIZABETH Only ! And what good is it now ? It 's overrun by Irish . p. 21 DEVEREAUX I will free it . ELIZABETH For what ? DEVEREAUX To live there . ELIZABETH In Ireland ? DEVEREAUX To defend my father 's land and honor . ELIZABETH Be careful of the Irish . DEVEREAUX Also of you . ELIZABETH ( Amused ) What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enchant like witches and devour like wolves . ELIZABETH And me ? DEVEREAUX You are as beautiful as they say . ELIZABETH A Queen hears many lies . DEVEREAUX Madam , I never lie , though , since Raleigh has tired me out , I will sit . He sits . ELIZABETH No one sits while the Queen stands . DEVEREAUX God does ! ELIZABETH Does he ? I must ask the Archbishop . HE stands . p. 22 ELIZABETH I 'll call you Robin ! I am not unpleased with you . DEVEREAUX Nor I with you . ELIZABETH Do not try to flatter me . DEVEREAUX I have taken great pains not to learn the art of flattery . ELIZABETH That is what I need . I must keep you near me . DEVEREAUX All afternoon ? ELIZABETH You will live at court . DEVEREAUX You have not consulted me . ELIZABETH Perhaps your opinion in this matter is not of interest to me . ( Beat ) Do you wish to live at court ? DEVEREAUX ( Beat , quietly ) Yes , then .

When HELEN sees DEVEREAUX , she is startled and brushes one of the silver makeup boxes onto the floor . HE picks it up and returns it to her . p. 23 ELIZABETH Show him to lodgings . HELEN Happily , Lady ! HELEN curtsies . HELEN ( To Devereaux ) Come with me . HELEN and DEVEREAUX exit . ELIZABETH Lord Keeper ! KEEPER enters . ELIZABETH Tell my Steward , tonight , a feast ! Music ! Dancing ! Tomorrow this courtier will wear my scarf in the tournament ! KEEPER OF THE SEAL But Madam , I believe you told Lord Burleigh no man would ever again wear your scarf in a tournament . ELIZABETH My dear man , I have changed my mind ! ( With gusto ) .

BURLEIGH hurries in with THE ARCHBISHOP and THE MASTER OF THE KEYS . MASTER OF THE KEYS My Lady , Philip 's Ambassador is embarking to sail for Spain . ARCHBISHOP You must tell him whether you will marry Philip . ELIZABETH ( to BURLEIGH ) My Lord , in Spain an hour must be less than sixty minutes ! BURLEIGH He is enraged . He says he will not wait . MASTER OF THE KEYS Will you marry Philip ? ELIZABETH I am already married . BURLEIGH This is a surprise . ARCHBISHOP To whom ? ELIZABETH My subjects . MASTER OF THE KEYS With whom you can not have a child . ELIZABETH Witty man ! My Lords , I will no longer pretend to love a Prince of Europe . Twenty-six years of games with various Princes is sufficient . ARCHBISHOP We must have an heir . ELIZABETH You offend , good Counsellors . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KEYS This is a matter of the succession , which is not private . My Lady , are you still capable of bearing a child ? ELIZABETH You will leave me ! ARCHBISHOP You must decide about Philip . ELIZABETH And you must leave me ! ( Beat ) Lord Burleigh , please stay . MASTER OF THE KEYS , THE ARCHBISHOP exit . ELIZABETH This is an outrage , is it not ? BURLEIGH Nothing could be of more general concern to the people who love you , Greatness , than whether you bear an heir . ELIZABETH It is my body ! BURLEIGH The Queen 's body , forgive me , is a department of the state . ELIZABETH My Lord Burleigh ! BURLEIGH If you marry the wrong man , England will pay . ELIZABETH Who , then , must I marry ? BURLEIGH A man who is equal . A man who can give us an heir . ELIZABETH Beat . Suppose I were too old to bear an heir . p. 26 BURLEIGH It is the possibility , My Lady . If you do not perpetuate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Papists will each advance their own candidate for the succession . They can not do so while anyone believes you might bear a child . ELIZABETH I will not marry Philip . BURLEIGH ( Beat ) Very well , you must name a successor . ELIZABETH The day after I name a successor , I will be overthrown by the successor I have named . ( Smiling ) Do you wish to spend your old age with me in the Tower ? BURLEIGH If we return this answer to Philip , Spain will send ships against us . ELIZABETH And we will destroy them ! BURLEIGH Their galleons are men to our children . ELIZABETH The old Book says that a quick boy defeated a giant of a man . BURLEIGH This is true , Greatness , but --  ELIZABETH Our nobles who fight one another must instead compete to design a fast ship for our navy . BURLEIGH Ahhhh ! It takes a regiment of advisors to comprehend what you grasp from the English oak that lines the walls of your bedroom ! The Privy Council shall talk of this tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Spain shall not defeat England . BURLEIGH Indeed it shall not , Lady . ELIZABETH You have worked all day , dear Burleigh . Now let us have some amusement . BURLEIGH I must carry this word to the Spanish Ambassador . ELIZABETH Allow him to cool his boots at the docks . Stay by me . Where is that blue-eyed astrologer from Italy ? BURLEIGH Entertaining your waiting women with jokes . ELIZABETH Beg him to entertain me with his knowledge tonight . BURLEIGH He sails for Padua in an hour . ELIZABETH He will stay here . And see that they feed him well ! BURLEIGH You saw that last week he did not hesitate to consume your beef and sherry . ELIZABETH He ate no mutton . BURLEIGH Why not ? ELIZABETH Because sheep sometimes sleep beside pigs . BURLEIGH So do farmers . ELIZABETH He would eat no farmers , either . THEY both laugh . p. 28 ELIZABETH Please have them open the fine port wine for him . I will glean his ideas about the stars . BURLEIGH His ideas are questionable , Greatness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ideas . BURLEIGH Thank you , Greatness . BURLEIGH hurries outs . SERVANT brings on table and chair . HELEN enters and begins painting the QUEEN 'S face . ELIZABETH ( Beat ) Penelope ? HELEN Yes , my Lady . ELIZABETH Have you spoken with the new gallant ? HELEN Which one , my Lady ? ELIZABETH Robert Devereaux . HELEN Yes , my Lady . ELIZABETH Indeed ! Now which Penelope are you ? HELEN I am the one often called Helen , my Lady . ELIZABETH Ah , Helen . You will advise me , Helen , what sort of man Robert Devereaux is . HELEN I am surprised you consider him , my Lady . p. 29 ELIZABETH What do you imagine I consider ? HELEN You are very great . I can not tell . ELIZABETH Do you believe a Queen can love ? HELEN I do not know . ELIZABETH You must venture a guess ! HELEN Can the sky love ? ELIZABETH Excellent question ! The sky must love the earth , since it bends so close . HELEN They call you the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HELEN They call you the firmament because you are The Queen , who came rightly to the throne through the succession , and whose rule keeps order in the planets , in nature , and in the state . And who , under God , will save us from the cruel invasion of Philip . ELIZABETH Ah , you 've learned that catechism well ! How clever you are ! From now on , you will speak to me in Latin ! HELEN I do not know Latin , my Lady . ELIZABETH Not one word ? HELEN ( Beat ) A few . p. 30 ELIZABETH Which ? ( Beat ) Come ! ( Beat ) You must tell me ! HELEN Sicut erat in principio et nunc , et semper , in secula seculorum . . . . ELIZABETH The old service ! ( Whispering ) You must not say that again . HELEN What , never ? ELIZABETH Never !

You refuse to count , too ? HELEN No , my Lady , I mean no one taught me my age . ELIZABETH One KNOWS one 's age ! HELEN I fear I do not , my Lady . I was abandoned on the palace doorstep like a stray cat , they say , in a large wooden herring barrel and the buttery cook found me . They forgot to leave a sign telling my age . ELIZABETH If you do not know your age and you can not read Latin , how will you learn about . . . This is unsatisfactory . Someone like you , Helen , must learn Latin . p. 31 HELEN Why , my Lady ? ELIZABETH For instance , one must read Ovid to learn the art of love . HELEN One must ? ELIZABETH In Latin . HELEN One can not love in English ? ELIZABETH Ah , I see . What do you know about love ? HELEN Animals love in English . People love in English . Everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English ! HELEN The butterflies , for instance , you can see them at this time of year .

THE QUEEN dips her finger in makeup and writes on the mirror the word AMOR ELIZABETH Amor . It means love . SHE pulls a book out of her pocket and hands it to HELEN . ELIZABETH Read this grammar . We will begin your lessons tomorrow . The QUEEN stands . HELEN curtsies and exits with the cart . Lights change . BURLEIGH enters , bows . p. 32 ELIZABETH My Lord ? BURLEIGH Do you remember your pastry chef ? Simon . Arrested by Lord Walsingham on Ascension Day . ELIZABETH Indeed .

BURLEIGH Your evidence , my Grace ? SHE moves to pick up a paper from her desk . p. 33 ELIZABETH The seal appears to be Spanish , but you see , it is counterfeit . Who did this ? BURLEIGH Not I , Greatness . ELIZABETH Lord Keeper ? Master ? LORD KEEPER and MASTER OF THE KEYS enter . ELIZABETH Someone has counterfeited the evidence . KEEPER OF THE SEAL Not I , your Majesty . MASTER OF THE KEYS Not I. ELIZABETH Possibly Walshingham and his Secret Service . BURLEIGH Greatness , in this court we do not invent evidence . ELIZABETH Indeed . The Jesuits must have invented it . KEEPER OF THE SEAL Why would they do that ? MASTER OF THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain . ELIZABETH Does he say that he is ? BURLEIGH He says he is a Puritan . ELIZABETH Then perhaps that 's what he is . BURLEIGH Why would the Catholics plant a Spanish passport on a Puritan ? p. 34 ELIZABETH To provoke his arrest . Because we arrest Jesuits . KEEPER OF THE SEAL You would twist logic into a French knot to free him . ELIZABETH No , no , no . It 's simple . This man is a Puritan . A zealot against the Jesuits . No wonder the Jesuits want him killed . And look ! They have nearly been successful . BURLEIGH Indeed , then Greatness . Suppose he is a Puritan . Zealots of any kind are dangerous . ELIZABETH He must be let go . MASTER OF THE KEYS Whitehall has become a nest of plots and counterplots . ELIZABETH My people are loyal , are they not , Spirit ? BURLEIGH They adore you , my Lady .

KEEPER OF THE SEAL The Puritans , the Catholics  --  do not hate you , but they hate one another . You will be caught in the middle . ELIZABETH I must steer between them . KEEPER OF THE SEAL They need an example . p. 35 MASTER OF THE KEYS Walshingham and all of us agree . You must execute this man ! ELIZABETH My Lords , we must have proof before we draw and quarter a man . This is an innovation called justice . THE ADVISORS exit . ELIZABETH walks out into a corridor , reading . SIMON bursts in , fighting with a guard , ( played by the actor who plays Burleigh ? ) who is trying to keep him out . SIMON throws the GUARD to the ground and runs toward the QUEEN .

And she 's frequently alone with my Lady , making up her face . ALICE I 've swapped rings with her . She 's not a Papist . SIMON I 've seen her with a rosary . ALICE You have not ! SIMON She would n't worship the rosary in front of you ! It 's all dumb shows around here . HELEN ( Looking up from her book ) The Queen is the sky ? How can she be the sky ? The sky does n't have fingers and toes . My Lady is n't blue ! This is ridiculous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the book . SIMON This Helen paints Her Majesty 's face .

SIMON Suppose she gives a Jesuit the key to the Queen 's rooms ? ALICE If you turn her in , Simon , I may begin to hate you . p. 39 SIMON I will do nothing until we talk further . I 'm late for the docks . ALICE Do n't go ! This time they 'll put a knife between your shoulders . SIMON I have my disguises . As SIMON exits , DANVERS follows to talk to him .

ALICE What new star ? HELEN Can you see it ? ALICE ( Searching ) No . HELEN Then perhaps I 'm just imagining it . That would be better  --  if the blue-eyed astrologer could talk of love , but knew nothing about the firmament . HELEN gives ALICE the glass . ALICE I see something . . . up there . . . shimmering ! Yes . HELEN You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is wrong ! ALICE About what ? HELEN The sky is not a glass bowl . Because how could a new star get through the layers of crystal up there ? It could n't . ALICE You are so clever , Helen ! p. 41 HELEN And now what can we hang onto ? I mean , if the sky is not crystal , how does it even stay up ? ALICE The sky ? ? Stay up ? What do you mean , Love ? HELEN My Lady ! She is n't really the sky . ALICE How could she be the sky ? HELEN Everything is different than she said . ALICE Do n't let that upset you . You know how Queens go on .

DEVEREAUX None of those troublesome little creatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . . dismal , plain , rustic food . I do n't believe there are any scones here . DEVEREAUX Ah , maybe that 's why there are no ants in the scones . Perhaps next time we should risk the ants . ELIZABETH Let 's talk about dancing . DEVEREAUX You dance like wild fire , Lady . ELIZABETH Nonsense ! DEVEREAUX You glitter like fireworks . ELIZABETH Tedious , tedious ! DEVEREAUX Fireworks are tedious ? ELIZABETH Flattery is tedious . DEVEREAUX We could talk properly if we were alone together . ELIZABETH What would you talk of , my gallant ? p. 43 DEVEREAUX I hear Philip is building an Armada . ELIZABETH Come , that is not for you . That is State business . DEVEREAUX I know how to fight , my Lady . Let me tell you . We will draw apart . ELIZABETH I can not , my Lord .

Take the ruff off it ! HELEN My Lord , I must speak properly . DEVEREAUX You must say what you feel . p. 55 HELEN You are above me . DEVEREAUX I am only above you because I spend my time buttoning a collar . I do not want to be above you . I was not above you before I came to Court . And what am I now ? In these clothes ?

HE tries it on . HELEN No , my Lord . If you are king of England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Philip is building more ships . HELEN They say so . DEVEREAUX I am worried . Gravely worried . In such a time , perhaps God will call out his anointed . HELEN Who , my Lord ? DEVEREAUX Sometimes I think I was born for something . Sometimes I see it , in early morning , when I am riding , the mists rising as at the birth of time . The song of swallows , as close as this hand . HELEN That you are god 's anointed ? DEVEREAUX And you . And all of us . The least of us are not less than a Sovereign . In my darkest moments , I feel God made me for this dark time . Listen , Helen , I see fire on the horizon . If the Queen does not see it , perhaps someone else must sound the alarm . HELEN Ambition picks up houses and flings them out to sea . And what about the people in those houses ? p. 58 DEVEREAUX Should Philip go unchecked ? Someone must fight him ! Must ride out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at dawn . Sometimes I am certain it is me . Perhaps that 's why I was called to wear this ruff , to speak this language . But then it goes away . What terrifies me  - -  a man may have only one chance to answer God 's call . Years from now , they 'll look back at us . HELEN Not at me . I 'll be invisible to them . DEVEREAUX They 'll read about us both . HELEN It 's only nobles who live in history . You 'll be here . Passing an afternoon . Buttoning your ruff . DEVEREAUX And they 'll say , this is how it went . Philip murdered the English in their beds . Here is one who could have changed it . Why did he do nothing ? HE hands the crown to her . HELEN My Lord , is this why you came to Court ? DEVEREAUX My stepfather sent me here to find a woman who would cure my bad inheritance with her title and lands . HELEN Then let that be your task , my dear Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 59 HELEN Indeed . You have . ALICE enters , sweeping . DEVEREAUX I was not born to please my stepfather . HELEN Perhaps you were not born for anything in particular . You must listen to me , my Lord . DEVEREAUX I do n't know what I was born for . HELEN Oh , be careful , my Lord , or you will be trapped in history . A SERVANT enters and removes the cart . Lights to dark . HELEN checks around her to make sure she is alone . Then she pulls out a glass and gazes at the sky . When ALICE comes over , HELEN hides the glass , pulls out Ovid and reads . ALICE They 're fitting our dresses for the dance tomorrow . Come try them on . HELEN I wo n't be dancing . ALICE All you do these days is read , Love . HELEN She gives me chapters . ALICE I am sorry for you . HELEN You must not be .

ALICE Many lovers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HELEN Indeed ! I am in heaven . The stars are my lovers . ALICE The stars ? HELEN Which are more beautiful than the palace cats !

She is our sunlight . DANVERS But everything you are , you owe to England . DEVEREAUX As do we all . But I ask you , by what light will England see if her light is put out ? DANVERS This is no time for a sonnet , good man . Philip sails for England . DEVEREAUX We must believe that she will check him . DANVERS What is a Queen , compared to England ? DEVEREAUX She has hands . England does not . She has lips . England does not . And now -- she has called me to Dover . DANVERS Do you think the Queen will ever have you , my Lord ? She does not see you as her equal . Your future lies with us . DEVEREAUX My good man , if you speak of this again , I am bound to tell Lord Walshingham !

It is hard here , my Lady , being forced to talk this court talk . Come , be free and honest . We will sit on the grass . The sun will shine on us . ELIZABETH I must be Queen , my Lord . DEVEREAUX Is the Queen not a woman ? ELIZABETH The Queen must be the government , my Lord . DEVEREAUX But surely not always . ELIZABETH The Government sits . HE sits . DEVEREAUX When you sit , I sit . When you lie , I will follow you , too . ELIZABETH But I must not lie with you . DEVEREAUX I may not mention your beauty or I am a flatterer . Now that I mention love , I am a jester . You are not a woman . You are only a Queen . ELIZABETH What do you want , my Lord Essex ? DEVEREAUX To marry you . ELIZABETH I can not . DEVEREAUX Why ? ELIZABETH St. Paul has written , Wives obey your husbands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must obey you . DEVEREAUX It will be different with us . ELIZABETH You must not talk so ! DEVEREAUX I lose myself when we speak in court riddles ! I do not know what I think any more , which is why I must make my heart and tongue at one . You will marry me ! ELIZABETH For less I have seen Queens go to the block ! I have seen an Archbishop burn ! I have bade my lover goodbye at night , to see him buried in two graves the next morning ! DEVEREAUX What should I do ? ELIZABETH We must dance with chains on ! DEVEREAUX I see you will remain a Queen . Then I will give service to a Queen . I am leaving for Spain . ELIZABETH For what ? DEVEREAUX To fight Philip . ELIZABETH England is not at war with Spain . DEVEREAUX Philip makes ready to sail against us . ELIZABETH He threatens .

I will hear what you say about Spain . DEVEREAUX My advice has never changed your policy . ELIZABETH It shall now . DEVEREAUX You are one woman to me , another to your Privy Council . ELIZABETH You will be my delegate to the Privy Council . DEVEREAUX They will not accept me . ELIZABETH They can not but honor my delegate . DEVEREAUX You will change your mind about this . ELIZABETH You will sit . Tomorrow . You see how your power grows . p. 67 DEVEREAUX I will consider sitting tomorrow . If I am not on my way to Spain . DEVEREAUX bows and exits . BURLEIGH enters , carrying a book . ELIZABETH Dear Lord Burleigh , I am glad to see you . I know you have not been well . I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat the wisest men in the Kingdom on the Privy Council . BURLEIGH Indeed , I was wise to have said so . ELIZABETH You will ask the Earl of Essex to join the Privy Council as my delegate . BURLEIGH My Lady , you have mistaken pleasure for wisdom . ELIZABETH How clever you are , dear Spirit ! The Queen does indeed take pleasure in wisdom . BURLEIGH First you gave Lord Essex the license for sweet wine . Now you will make him a member of your Privy Council ? ELIZABETH Although young , he is blessed with great understanding . BURLEIGH Do not , my Lady . ELIZABETH I have already decided . BURLEIGH You would choose this man over England ? ELIZABETH What is My Lord Essex for , if not England ? p. 68 BURLEIGH He removes you from your people , Greatness . You dance with him nights and jest with him days . You barely held court on your Ascension Day Feast . ELIZABETH I know you are not well , dear Spirit , but come , do not scold . I hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my Lady . Which speaks of a shallow and ambitious courtier . ELIZABETH I am prepared to pay extravagantly for it . Let us see it . BURLEIGH gives her the book . SHE opens and scans it eagerly . ELIZABETH Ah , what has he written about me ? . . . . . ( reading ) The public Queen and the private Queen . He has split my image into several women . Gloriana the Queen . Belphoebe , the love maiden . Britomart , the warrior . Why this is an insult ! The Queen is not a monster with three heads ! Tell him I will give him five pounds ! BURLEIGH Five pounds , Grace , is nothing for ten years ' work ! ELIZABETH Send him back to Ireland ! Tell him to write a book with one Queen . QUEEN storms out . BURLEIGH is following her . DEVEREAUX enters . BURLEIGH turns to walk with him . p. 69 BURLEIGH The Queen instructs me to invite you to her Privy Council . DEVEREAUX Neither you nor the Privy Council will have me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your discernment and discretion . DEVEREAUX Why do you lie to me , my Lord ? BURLEIGH I do not lie . I believe you will vote to fight in Spain . DEVEREAUX You hope I will vote for war , then leave for Spain . You would have me die there . BURLEIGH Unfortunately , men like you do not die easily . DEVEREAUX You are too kind , Lord Burleigh . BURLEIGH My Lord Essex , you may forget about fighting in Spain unless you sit in the Privy Council and advise my Lady to strike at Philip .

ELIZABETH What is the sky made of ? HELEN Crystal . ELIZABETH Is crystal solid ? HELEN Crystal is solid . ELIZABETH Can a new star enter a solid sky ? HELEN No , my Lady . ELIZABETH The young astrologer may dance beautifully , but on the subject of astrology he must be a lunatic . HELEN The young astrologer saw the star quite clearly . Between the Big Dipper and the Little Dipper . ELIZABETH Have you seen it , little snail ? p. 71 HELEN No . ELIZABETH You will never see it . The firmament , like the State , is ordained by God . It admits nothing new . It is solid . Crystal . HELEN Then why is it not scratched ? ELIZABETH Why that 's absurd ! HELEN Why has n't it cracked in the wind ? ELIZABETH How entertaining you are ! HELEN I do not mean to be entertaining , my Lady . ELIZABETH Listen to me , Helen . When the rightful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be heard spinning --  ELIZABETH  - -  Which is called the music of the spheres . HELEN I know that is what your court astrologers would have us believe .

ELIZABETH ( To Cecil ) For which , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As you will , my Lady . BURLEIGH In deferring to Lord Essex 's ambition , Greatness , you have outraged Lord Nottingham .

The sound of celebration continues . The clock strikes eight . DEVEREAUX slowly takes off his black cloak . He is wearing a red , silk shirt . HE looks up , as if listening to God . Then , with triumph HE kneels and lays his head on the block . THE EXECUTIONER raises the axe . As the axe hits the block , lights to black on DEVEREAUX .

Perhaps when they write about me , they will say that I destroyed the monarchy . HELEN You have kept it safe . ELIZABETH I have tried to love the people most . QUEEN 's face can now be seen , bare and beautiful . ELIZABETH Do you think God will recognize me ? HELEN I am sure he will , Lady . ELIZABETH Will I bow to him ? HELEN Perhaps you should , my Lady .

Lights down on ELIZABETH and HELEN as they come down on DEVEREAUX and the EXECUTIONER . The sound of celebration continues in the street . Dead dark . Silence . Servants remove furniture and banners . Lights rise to blazing . HELEN stands alone on empty stage . A blast of Trumpets . Four ceremonially robed men enter as before , carrying a coffin . They stand at balanced points around the coffin . The trumpets finish . HELEN That 's what I saw . What I think I saw . History . Do n't touch it yet . The ink is still drying . On what they say about her -- on what they will tell their children , and they theirs --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard . His Queen is waiting for me . SHE does not speak Latin . She does n't even read .

The Italian astrologer with the blue blue eyes finally answered my letter . He says the firmament is not like a glass bowl ! The earth and the stars are moving ! Nothing will ever be the same again . Men and their little works are not in the center , do you see ? The sky is endless and when we look into it , we are gazing straight up at . . . at what ? I must find out . I have already talked to the Italian Ambassador about sailing ships to Padua and the blue eyed astrologer . All these others you will find in history books , but you will not find me .
