Politicians and Volcanoes // It was a coincidence of geography . On May 8 , 1902 , the beautiful city of St. Pierre , Martinique , known as the Paris of the Caribbean , happened to be in the killing path of a searingly hot volcanic hurricane that swept down the flank of Mount Pelee and killed 29,000 people . And it was a circumstance of timing that the city was in the process of election campaigning . It was an atmosphere doubly charged with election politics and a volcano that had been acting up for a couple of months . People were ambivalent about leaving : on the one hand , they wanted to support their candidate , but on the other , the explosions , rumblings , and sulfurous smell of the volcano frightened many , some of whom chose to leave the area . And yet , there were some curious people who came to St. Pierre from other towns and villages to watch the eruption . In 1902 volcanologists had a very rudimentary knowledge about volcanic processes and did not know that volcanic hurricanes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clastic = " broken " ) existed . Hence this eruption made Mount Pelee the greatest killer volcano of the twentieth century . If the precatastrophic volcanic activity then shown by Mount Pelee were to occur today , modern volcanologists , having gained ninety years of cumulative experience since the 1902 eruption , would very likely urge immediate evacuation of the city regardless of other circumstances . // Gaston Landes , a professor at the high school in St. Pierre in 1902 , said that ash and the sulfur smell from Mount Pelee would not cause great damage , and if the volcano erupted lava flows , they could not reach the city because too many ridges and valleys stood in the way . He was right about the lava flows , but he did not know about hot pyroclastic flows . He gave assurances that little damage would occur even with a big eruption . But on May 8 at 8:03 A.M. the most explosive eruption began , and within five minutes the pyroclastic flow swept through St. Pierre , blowing away , burying , and burning buildings and people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhaling ash , which clogged their nasal passages and trachea , and searing gases , which scorched their lungs ( figs. 1-1 and 1-2 ) . // The eruption of Mount Pelee drew the world 's attention to the existence of pyroclastic flows and started a line of research that is still continuing ( see chap . 5 ) . Since 1902 , volcanologists have gathered considerable information about the behavior of volcanoes . They now have instruments to detect the small swellings of a volcano that indicate molten rock ( magma ) is rising into the edifice of the volcano . Seismologists , using seismographs , can find the origin of an earthquake ( the focus ) below a volcano and pinpoint the depth at which magma is stirring . Gases that originate from magma and reach the surface can be analyzed . One of these gases is sulfur dioxide , which indicates that live magma is moving upward through the volcano and may erupt . The presence of older rock fragments within the exploded debris suggests that the explosions are caused by groundwater that flashes to steam from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock . The presence of newly solidified pieces of magma suggests that magma could be approaching the surface . // Knowledge of volcanic behavior gained during the twentieth century was used by volcanologists at Mount St. Helens in 1980 to warn of impending danger , but as with Mount Pelee , volcanologists still did not have enough information to predict with certainty how Mount St. Helens was going to behave . // A Modern Tragedy : Mount St. Helens // On March 25 , 1980 , a group of geology students and three professors ( including one of the authors-RVF ) from a class in volcanology at the University of California at Santa Barbara visited the Hawaii Volcanological Observatory . We went to the wrong place to witness the beginning of an eruption , for on March 27 , Mount St. Helens would erupt . But we did learn from an excited seismologist at the observatory that an earthquake of magnitude 4.1 had occurred beneath Mount St. Helens in southern Washington on March 20 , ending the volcano 's 123-year rest . Other earthquakes at Mount St. Helens before March 27 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Had we gone to the chain of volcanoes that forms the backbone of the Cascade Mountains instead of to Hawaii , we would have witnessed the modest beginnings of one of the most highly publicized and intensely studied eruptions of the twentieth century . Then , on May 18 , 1980 , nearly two months after the first stirrings of Mount St. Helens , the volcano turned violent . // An Eruption Carnival Turned Tragic // Mount St. Helens was center stage and people came for the show . During the interval prior to its climactic eruption-from March 20 to May 17 , 1980-the volcano entertained the public . Mount St. Helens ' antics and its potential for danger drew people from everywhere . Entrepreneurs sold T-shirts , cups , posters , and bric-a-brac labeled with humorous slogans and cartoons ( fig. 1-3 ) . The main evacuation artery north of Mount St. Helens , Washington State Highway 504 , was jammed with sightseers , there to witness the first eruption in the lower forty-eight states since Mount Lassen erupted in 1914 . Some people said they came to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sold by the thousands . Roadblocks challenged some of the spectators , who then broke them down or snuck around them . State officials set up a " red zone " around Mount St. Helens to keep people from possible harm should there be an eruption ( fig. 1-4 ) ; however there were not enough personnel to monitor the roadblocks twenty-four hours a day . The activity of the volcano excited people , and they wanted to see it . But at 8:32 A.M. , May 18 , 1980 , the carnival turned tragic with a violent eruption . Many people , some on official business , died within the red zone . Volcano watchers , as well as campers thought to be in safe zones and out of sight of the volcano , were also caught in the doomed area . // On the quiet , sunny morning of May 18 , Charles McNerney , John Smart , and several other people had found their way to an overlook to watch Mount St. Helens , just in case it erupted . They had a good view of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near Castle Lake , 13 kilometers ( see appendix 2 ) west of the volcano . At 8:32 A.M. , the volcano watchers got their wish . It was much deadlier than they could have dreamed , for the north side of the volcano collapsed . Then came the blast . A black cloud came directly from the summit and within seconds climbed over a ridge toward them . A warm wind began blowing ahead of the cloud and increased until trees bent over and branches broke ; the approaching blast must have pushed air in front of it . The events of the first two minutes after the eruption were warning enough for McNerney and Smart to leave . The other people may have decided to leave a minute or two later , but it would have been too late because even McNerney and Smart barely escaped with their lives . They drove as fast as they could ( up to 125 kilometers per hour on straight stretches ) down a dirt road toward Highway 504 but the cloud was gaining on them . They felt the radiant heat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car through the open sunroof . It felt like the car 's heater was on . After reaching the paved Highway 154 , they accelerated to 140 kilometers per hour on some stretches and finally began to outdistance the cloud . When they lost sight of it , they stopped in relief , hoping that it , too , had stopped ; but it soon reappeared , moving at about 72 kilometers per hour . The base of the cloud looked to them like an avalanche of black chalk dust . First , one part of the cloud shot out in front , then another , then another , like waves lapping onto a beach . What they were seeing was the turbulent front of a deadly pyroclastic flow . After pulling back onto the highway , they finally outran the cloud , at an average speed of 105 kilometers per hour . // Early that morning , James Scymanky and three others were cutting wood in the valley of Hoffstadt Creek , 20 kilometers away from , and completely out of sight of , Mount St. Helens . Showing little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were felling small trees with chainsaws when a fourth man shouted that he saw a cloud appear over the ridge . Within about ten seconds came a thunderous crashing , crunching , and grinding sound from the east as trees were felled by of the blast . The men were soon engulfed by the blast cloud . The force knocked Scymanky down , and he felt a searing , painful heat on his back that lasted about two minutes . When visibility returned , the forest of small trees lay upon the ground throughout the entire valley , which was covered with 25 centimeters of gray ash . The men 's clothing remained intact , but their bodies had been extensively burned . Scymanky 's lungs were not fatally seared , and he somehow survived his burns , but the others subsequently died from theirs . // The explosion from Mount St. Helens fanned outward on the ground from the volcano in the pattern of a half circle . It had occurred as a blast that moved faster and more forcefully northward than eastward or westward . From eyewitness accounts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 510 kilometers per hour for a distance of 13 kilometers . Four parties of campers had settled near the northern boundary of destruction . They were not volcano watchers and had not camped where they could see the volcano . They were also separated from it by one or two 300-meter-high ridges . Three of these people , Dale and Leslie Davis and Albert Brooks , had stalled their pickup truck while trying to escape and the blast cloud overran them . It looked to them like a " boiling mass of rock " that picked up trees and threw them into the air . Darkness descended as the cloud surrounded them , and it became very hot in the truck cab . Chunks of rock and wood pounded the truck for a short time but , except for a small vent on the right side of the truck , the windows did not break . One of the trio received burns on both legs , just above the ankles , as ash entered the truck through the broken vent window . A brief period of light appeared a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ash fell again so densely that they could not see the truck 's hood . Nearly a half hour later , at 9 A.M. , they decided to abandon the vehicle and walk , even though the darkness required that they use a flashlight . By 10:20 A.M. murky ash still kept visibility at about 10 meters . It was n't until later that day , after the sky had cleared , that they were rescued by helicopter . // Later examination of the truck showed that heat had deformed its plastic grill and had melted a styrofoam cooler in the truck bed . The vehicle 's right side , which had faced the volcano , had been extensively damaged-the blast had stripped its chrome trim and had sandblasted the paint . // In Miners Creek , which was over the ridge from the pickup truck , Edward Smith and his companions had tipped an external-frame tent on its side to dry out . A little after 8:32 A.M. , several gusts of wind suddenly blew the tent over and were immediately followed by what sounded like three distant rifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloud shot overhead , and rocks as big as golf balls began to fall . The sky became dark , and ash fell so heavily that visibility was no more than about a half a meter , even by the light of a flashlight . Although thousands of trees fell , Smith and his friends did not hear them , nor did they feel a blast or wind at that time . The first material to fall on them was cold , but shortly thereafter , the air became uncomfortably hot , as if a forest fire were nearby , but the heat did not last very long . // Two other groups were camped along the north bank of the Green River about 22 kilometers north of the volcano and across two 300-meter-high ridges , certainly a safe distance from Mount St. Helens , or so everybody thought , even the volcanologists . One of the groups included Bruce Nelson , Sue Ruff , Terry Crall , and Karen Varner . Nelson and Ruff told of a wind that preceded the blast cloud by ten to fifteen seconds , strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not strong enough to impede a person 's movement or to blow down trees . The campers heard no loud noises prior to the cloud 's arrival , but when it did arrive , daylight turned to darkness and all of the trees seemed to topple over simultaneously . In the confusion , Nelson and Ruff accidentally fell into a hole left by the root ball of a blown-over tree and were protected from other falling trees . They could hear one another while in the hole , but it was too dark to see . After they had been in the hole about ten seconds , the temperature increased enough to singe their hair , which they could hear sizzle . ( Hair singes at 120 degrees C. ) Bruce Nelson , a baker familiar with ovens , estimated the temperature to be about 300 degrees F. The heat was intense enough to boil pitch from the trees and still cause minor burns several minutes later . After a few minutes of darkness , the sky suddenly cleared for a few minutes and then a dense fall of ash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the debris , they called for Crall and Varner but received no answer-they had been killed by falling trees . Close by were two other campers , Dan Balch and Bryan Thomas . A tree fell on Bryan Thomas and broke his hip , but he was too heavy to carry , so Nelson , Ruff , and Balch built him a lean-to for shelter and set out on foot . Balch , who was barefoot , could not walk through the hot ash and was also left behind . Nelson and Ruff continued and during their trek encountered Grant Christensen , whose pickup truck would not start . After about three hours , the three sighted a helicopter , which they signaled by using their clothes to stir up dust . The three men , together with Balch and Thomas , were rescued that day by helicopter . // Mike and Lu Moore , from the town of Castle Rock , were camped near the Green River at a point 20 kilometers from the volcano with their daughters , four-year-old Bonnie Lu and three-month-old Terra . They had parked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a campsite intending to return to Castle Rock on Sunday afternoon . While making breakfast the next morning , Lu Moore noticed a rumbling noise and reported that " it felt like there was an earthquake inside you . " The family quickly loaded their backpacks and moved to a shelter for hunters . According to Mike Moore , " You could physically see the cloud of ash moving toward us . It was the blackest cloud I had ever seen " ( Daily News , Volcano , p. 61 ) . Thunder and lightning accompanied the cloud , which passed over them , and it turned very dark as ash began to fall . So much ash rained down that the Moores had to breathe through stockings to filter it out . Within an hour or two , when the darkness had lifted , they wanted to return to their car but were blocked by fallen trees . They spent Sunday night in their tent and were rescued Monday morning by a helicopter . //               @ @ @ @ @ @
