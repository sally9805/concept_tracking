TARAWA IT WAS NOT . TO BE SURE , THE U.S. MARINES who hit the sands of Somalia before dawn last Wednesday were wearing full battle dress ; an advance guard of Navy SEALs sported camouflage paint . But the Marines jumped from hovercrafts and helicopters into a blaze not of gunfire but of TV lights , aimed and fired by a media army that had flown into the capital of Mogadishu in advance . Hardly any Somalis were to be seen ; a few who showed up later wanted to shake hands . <P> The Marines quickly took control of Mogadishu 's airport and docks . By Wednesday afternoon , the first plane in six weeks to bring in foreign food had landed . Two Somalis were killed and seven more injured on Thursday when their unarmed van crashed into a checkpoint established by French Foreign Legionnaires . Other Somalis were believed to have died Saturday when two U.S. Cobra helicopter-gunship crews returned fire and destroyed three armed Somali vehicles , including an armored personnel carrier . A third helicopter , hit by bullets in a separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearby to risk shooting back . But for the most part , armed gangs vanished from the streets of Mogadishu . At week 's end the country 's two main warlords met - for the first time in more than a year , under U.S. auspices , to vow truce and cooperation . <P> Whether the warlords ' word will be obeyed , especially in the anarchic countryside , is another matter . Amid continued reports of bloody clan battles , kidnapping of relief workers and looting of food supplies , U.N.-sponsored troops could not quickly get outside Mogadishu to help . They did seize an airstrip at Bale Dogle , about 60 miles outside the capital , but postponed a truck convoy to Baidoa , in the heart of the famine zone 150 miles from Mogadishu , until sufficient force could be mustered . <P> Somalia is a desert country with no railroads and not much of anything else . Ships and planes must bring in not only personnel  --  28,000 American and 2,000 French troops , plus contingents from about a dozen other countries  --  but also all their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is also continuing confusion about their mission . U.N . Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali told American officials that besides shooing away looters and distributing food , troops should disarm Somali war bands and train a military police force before leaving the country in the hands of a U.N . peacekeeping force . <P> Even so , the initial success raises anew the question : If Somalia , why not Bosnia ? U.S. , European and U.N . officials are in fact discussing possible intervention : shooting down Serbian planes now venturing with impunity into a supposed no-fly zone , perhaps even bombing Serb supply lines and artillery emplacements . But nobody is talking publicly of sending in U.S. ground troops . In Bosnia , unlike Somalia , a lot of them might get killed . ( See related cover stories beginning on page 29. )
