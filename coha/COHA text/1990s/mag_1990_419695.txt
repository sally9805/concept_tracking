Section : SCIENCE NEWS of the week Astronomers worry about aging components and sluggish software <p> On March 27 , if all goes well , astronaut Steve Hawley will maneuver a robot arm to gingerly lift a 43-foot cylinder from its berth in the cargo bay of the shuttle Discovery . Latches will unlock , two tightly rolled panels of solar cells on opposite sides of the cylinder will unfurl like window shades , and current will begin to course through the instrument 's complex circuitry The robot arm will then release its grasp and the shuttle will back away , leaving the cylinder in orbit 370 miles above Earth . By remote command , an aperture cover at the cylinder 's top will swing open , and for the first time , starlight unclouded by Earth 's turbulent atmosphere will strike a high-precision mirror that scientists finished polishing in 1981 . <p> At that moment , the world 's highest-resolution optical telescope will make its heavenly debut  --  seven years after its original launch date and nearly two decades after scientists began designing it . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the decade that revolutionized our understanding of the universe , " says astronomer Stephen P. Maran , who will direct some of the telescope 's observations at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center . in Greenbelt , Md . " The Hubble Space Telescope will be remembered as the instrument that first cracked open the window . " <p> But the project should also be remembered for its many setbacks , contends Robert C. Bless of the University of Wisconsin-Madison , who will work with the telescope 's high-speed photometer . " When the space telescope reaches orbit and begins sending back exciting new images of the universe , it may be tempting to put aside the problems encountered along the way , " Bless wrote in the winter 1988-89 ISSUES IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY . " That would be a mistake , for only if NASA recognizes the problems caused by its current policies will space science regain its lost vigor . " <p> Successful deployment of the Hubble Space Telescope  --  an aging explorer that nonetheless should reveal extraordinarily faint objects , give remarkable clarity to images of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth 's atmosphere  --  will climax a long and problem-plagued journey from drawing board to orbit . Dogged by delays ever since Congress approved its funding in 1977 , the device  --  actually five observing instruments ( see sidebar ) that feast on light from a single reflecting telescope  --  was first set for launch in late 1982 . Software and instrument problems pushed that date back to August 1986 . Then , in early January of 1986 , NASA rescheduled the launch for October to allow more time for testing equipment . Within weeks of that announcement , the Challenger shuttle exploded , prompting NASA to put further shuttle flights on hold . <p> Many scientists , including space telescope officials , view the latter delay as a mixed blessing for the project , arguing that the software for scheduling the telescope 's thousands of observations could n't have performed adequately in 1986 . But even after NASA upgraded the software and resumed shuttle flights , military and research missions critically dependent on launch timing continued to preempt the telescope 's deployment . As a result of the many delays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may get less from the $2 billion satellite than originally promised . <p> Some scientists worry that the aging equipment , now nearly as old as the telescope 's planned 15-year lifetime in space , could fail before all the key observations are made . Intensifying those worries is the inefficiency of the scheduling software , which might rob astronomers of half their potential observation time , Bless and others say . <p> " We 're launching a telescope with 1970s technology , " says astronomer Robert Brown of the Space Telescope Science Institute ( STScI ) in Baltimore , the university cooperative that coordinates software and research aspects of the mammoth project . In the years since the telescope 's initial planning , advances in observatory design , temperature control and optics have  --  perhaps inevitably  --  led to increasingly sensitive ground-based telescopes and light detectors , narrowing the technology gap between the space telescope and its counterparts on Earth . While the space telescope retains much of its observational superiority as well as its vantage point for detecting ultraviolet light that never reaches Earth , it might well have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The unprecedented telescope " was built with the NASA philosophy that big is beautiful , " says STScI spokesman Eric Chaisson , who notes that its size and intricacy have complicated and slowed the project . Bless and others say NASA would have been wiser to send up some of the observational equipment years ago on simpler , single-instrument missions . According to Bless , the photometer and spectrographs do n't require the complex and costly high-resolution mirror to achieve most of their goals . If NASA had launched them earlier on separate missions , he says , researchers could already have analyzed a wealth of data . <p> " NASA put all its eggs in one basket , but not all equipment needs such precision , " Bless says . Science is the loser , he contends , because the weight of the instrument-laden space telescope restricts it to a low orbit . A single-instrument satellite could reach geosynchronous orbit some 22,300 miles above Earth , allowing observations of the heavens to continue unimpeded during 85 to 90 percent of the orbiting time , he says . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low-orbiting space telescope 40 percent of the time . Nonetheless , Bless thinks the telescope will produce spectacular data . He estimates , for example , that its photometer will analyze starlight images with 100 to 200 times the resolution of the most sophisticated Earth-based devices . <p> Several NASA officials , including Goddard project scientist Albert Boggess , say the project 's management structure has further complicated matters . NASA distributed the responsibilities for manufacturing and installing equipment between two main contractors . And two separate NASA centers preside over the telescope , each equally involved in putting the pieces together . Goddard oversees operation of the device , while Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville , Ala. , coordinates equipment development and repairs . " NASA 's internal organization  --  having two centers  --  made it difficult to communicate , " says STScI 's Brown . <p> But perhaps the most serious management problems came with the development of the ground-based software known as SOGS ( for science operations ground system ) , designed to both schedule and record telescope observations during the mission . As a software package @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But those standards , formulated without input from researchers who will use the instruments , did n't account for the details and quirks of the telescope 's five light-detecting instruments . Though recently upgraded , the $70 million system still has a basic problem : It can schedule astronomical observations in order of priority , but trouble develops when it plans too far ahead . <p> In order to schedule each observation requested by astronomers , the software places a marker in its calendar of events , explains Rodger Doxsey , chief of computer operations at STScI . Because SOGS methodically checks and compares the amounts of free time between all markers before scheduling the next observation , the need for more computer time increases at an unacceptably high rate as the number of markers increases , Doxsey says . This and other problems have forced NASA to develop a second ground-based system , known as SPIKE , that can sketch out flexible plans for up to a year 's worth of observations . Three months in advance of actual observations , SPIKE will feed week-long segments of the master plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Doxsey calls SPIKE " nearly operational , " but even so , the scheduling process remains inefficient . SOGS " is not smart enough , " he says , to condense a lengthy observation or to expand a short one so that it fits into the 95 minutes of observation time available during a single orbit . Thus , SOGS could leave the telescope idle for several precious minutes between observations instead of arranging for continuous viewing . <p> Doxsey estimates that the SOGS/SPIKE combination now takes one-half day to schedule a day 's worth of observations  --  a significant improvement over the past rate but still falling short of the one-third-day goal . <p> Such delays disturb astronomers because the mechanical functions of the telescope 's detectors and the restrictions imposed by a low orbit already remove large chunks of observing time . For starters , the telescope typically needs several minutes to shift its orientation from star A to star B. Once the telescope reorients , its precision pointing system takes another 15 minutes to locate and track " guide stars " so that it can fix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is further reduced at certain times in the orbit because some of the sensitive light detectors ( such as the charge-coupled devices on the widefield/planetary camera ) can not point directly at the intense light of the sun . Astronomers lose still more observation time because the telescope avoids looking in the direction of the moon or the Earth ; light scattered from these bodies can distort star images . <p> Moreover , the telescope must interrupt observations during the 15 percent of its orbit when it passes through the South Atlantic Anomaly , a region over Brazil where the Earth 's radiation belt comes close enough to the satellite to interfere electronically with data collection . And about 40 percent of the time , Earth itself will block the telescope from observing any particular star . All this means the space telescope will at best detect starlight during only about 35 percent of its time in orbit . <p> In the first six months of orbit , with software still in need of debugging and scientists still unaccustomed to operating the telescope in space , that number may drop to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation becomes more routine , observation time should increase . " It 's not unusual for observations to become much more efficient after we learn where we can trim off minutes and seconds , " notes Peter Stockman , associate director of STScI . <p> Aside from eating up observation time , limitations inherent in SOGS and other ground-based software may hamper the use of certain instrument features as well as prevent observations of variable stars and the structural details of planets . For instance , the telescope 's high-resolution spectrograph can adjust its exposure on the spot  --  like a camera with an electronic light meter  --  according to the light intensity of the star or galaxy under study , But the software can not account for a shorter or longer exposure than the one preset . As a result , Doxsey says , researchers can not take advantage of the spectrograph 's variable exposure feature . <p> " We will be looking at more modern software that will come later , which will allow more complex observations , " Stockman says . " But for now we probably have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observations of rapidly moving planetary phenomena , such as Jupiter 's Great Red Spot , will have to wait , he says , because the system can not track them without smearing the image . <p> Further complications spring from the communications system that will convey messages back and forth between ground-based scientists and the telescope , says Bless . NASA uses the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System ( TDRSS ) for relaying messages to and from low-orbit satellites such as the space telescope . But with military and other satellites also competing for TDRSS time , telescope scientists can expect access to the system only about 15 to 20 percent of the time . This will limit their real-time observations , forcing the satellite to store some data on tape . And storage capacity is sorely limited . According to Doxsey , the telescope 's computers can hold about one-sixth the data storable in a typical personal computer . <p> The limited storage capacity will also force scientists to send relatively small command packages , he notes . " Using the TDRSS should not be a problem at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up later when observations become more frequent , " Doxsey says . <p> Maintenance of the elaborate and aging equipment may pose problems unforeseen by the telescope 's developers . Astronomers and designers originally assumed shuttle crews would replace , repair or readjust telescope components every 18 months or so . " Built into the design concept for the 15-year mission was that the shuttle would service the space telescope , " Brown says . " Batteries were meant to be changed , and at least 50 ' boxes ' of major equipment , worth about $1 million each , were meant to be replaced or checked . We thought the shuttle would run a number of times every year , " providing plenty of opportunities for sending up emergency repair missions . But in the years since the Challenger explosion , NASA has drastically reduced the number of shuttle launches on its schedule , and it now requires about 12 months ' notice to plan a repair mission . The agency has tentatively set the first such mission for late 1993  --  nearly four years after the telescope 's launch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some components of the space telescope no longer rate state-of-the-art status , notes STScI 's Stockman . The faint-object spectrograph , for instance , contains two detectors that share a one-dimensional array of diodes to record the intensity of light at particular wavelengths . Two-dimensional arrays since developed , Stockman says , could measure 20 to 40 spectra in the time it takes this spectrograph to record a single star spectrum . <p> Some features of the telescope 's widefield/planetary camera  --  actually two cameras in one  --  also worry scientists . While testing equipment several years ago , researchers discovered that when the telescope operates in a vacuum environment , a thin film of material , apparently from moisture-absorbing surfaces , condenses on its chilliest components  --  which happen to be the camera 's four light detectors . The condensing material , transparent to visible light but opaque to ultraviolet , may reduce the detectors ' already-low sensitivity to ultraviolet light . <p> Every few months , to rid detectors of the film before taking the next series of ultraviolet measurements , scientists will warm the camera from - 90C , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four-hour warm-up should do the trick , telescope scientists remain mystified by the film . " We 're not sure what the material is , " says NASA 's Boggess . Some researchers worry that the unknown contaminant might cause unexpected complications . <p> The multitude of setbacks , coupled with advances in ground-based equipment , have tempered earlier claims regarding the extent of the telescope 's observational superiority . While NASA initially boasted that the space telescope could see astronomical objects seven times as distant as those detected by ground-based telescopes , that assertion " was overselling , " says Chaisson . The telescope 's resolving power in visible light , about 0.1 arc-second ( comparable to what 's needed to distinguish a car 's right headlight from its left at a distance of 2,500 miles ) , is indeed about 10 times the average resolving power of today 's ground-based telescopes . But that may be changing . Last March , the New Technology Telescope in La Silla , Chile , significantly narrowed that gap when it briefly achieved a resolution of 0.36 arc-second , says Raymond N. Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Garching , West Germany . <p> The New Technology Telescope relies on a feedback system , called active optics , to achieve its resolving power . The computer-driven system counteracts gravity 's distorting effect on mirror shape as the telescope rotates . Larger-diameter telescopes now under construction will further rival the space telescope at optical wavelengths , Wilson says . In addition , researchers are experimenting with more complex feedback systems , known as adaptive optics , to adjust mirrors for rapid changes in Earth 's turbulent atmosphere  --  the chief stumbling block to improving resolving power on the ground . <p> What , in retrospect , can NASA learn from the frustrations encountered in building the world 's most expensive telescope ? <p> " If you choose a complicated way to run something , you have more complications , " Boggess says . <p> Brown asserts that the main lesson is the importance of getting early input from the people  --  in this case astronomers  --  who will actually use the instrument . Instead , he says , NASA 's planning procedure was " like writing a symphony by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has rehearsed separately in little music rooms , but they 've never played together . So people run around making sure that music in one room matches with music from another .... The space telescope components have never tried out the symphony together . " <p> Come March , astronomers may hear that symphony at last . Balancing their apprehensions with the prospect of viewing faint stars , hidden black holes and the nuclei of young galaxies , they 'll be hoping the telescope provides more than just an overture . <p> By Ron Cowen <p> Nuts and bolts <p> Three major systems serve as the nuts and bolts of the space telescope : the support systems module ; an assortment of light-detecting instruments and guidance sensors ; and the optical telescope assembly itself . <p> The support systems module will provide the power , communications , pointing ability and other operational assistance . Stacked within it are four main components : the light shield , which contains the telescope 's aperture door and internal baffles to catch stray light ; the forward shell , which has the main attachments for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doughnut-shaped electronics section ; and an aft shroud enclosing the light-detecting instruments . <p> Light reflected from the telescope 's 94.5-inch primary mirror can be intercepted by any of five light-detecting instruments and three fine-guidance sensors . Two of the radially positioned guidance sensors will locate and track an object targeted for observation while the third pinpoints the positions of neighboring objects . <p> The chief workhorse of the light-detecting instruments is the widefield/planetary camera , mounted behind the primary mirror . In its wide-field mode , the camera will image large , faint objects , including galaxies , clusters of galaxies , and quasars . Its smaller-aperture mode will survey large , bright objects  --  particularly planets  --  with a precision rivaling past flyby missions of the inner planets . <p> The four other light detectors encircle the primary mirror . The faint-object camera has a smaller field of view and is more sensitive to ultraviolet light than the planetary camera . Taking full advantage of the telescope 's high-resolution optics , it will count individual photons to image the dimmest objects detectable with the telescope  --  including 29th-magnitude stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectrograph will measure the spectra of dim bodies at both ultraviolet and optical wavelengths . It will examine the structure and composition of quasars , comets and galaxies , including active galactic nuclei . <p> The Goddard high-resolution spectrograph is the only device on the craft that operates solely in the ultraviolet . Designed for insensitivity to visible light , it enables detection of faint ultraviolet emissions from stars producing intense visible light . This spectrograph can detect objects about 1,000 times dimmer than those spotted by previous space-borne detectors . Because its aperture lets in more light and resolves it into finer increments , it should analyze spectra in greater detail than its faint-object counterpart . <p> The simplest instrument on board , the high-speed photometer , contains no moving parts . Dependent on the telescope 's pointing accuracy , this device will measure the total amount of light from an object and note brightness fluctuations on a time scale as precise as ten-millionths of a second . The photometer can detect rapidly spinning neutron stars or other compact objects , as well as gather detailed data on their flares. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
