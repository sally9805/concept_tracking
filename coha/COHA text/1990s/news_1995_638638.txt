<p> RENO , Nev. - Most everyone believes David Middleton was a bad cop , twisted enough to use his badge and uniform to hunt down vulnerable women on the streets of Miami and sexually abuse them . <p> Booted from the Miami police force in disgrace , Middleton went west to start a new life after a stay in a Florida prison . Women 's bodies are scattered along the path he took , from Colorado 's Western Slope to northern Nevada . <p> Prosecutors in Reno contend that Middleton , who has been sitting in the Washoe County Jail on a weapons charge , is a cop turned serial killer . Some people in the Colorado town of Montrose , home to about 12,000 who know and watch out for one another , believe an inattentive police department allowed Middleton , 34 , to kill and kill again . <p> Middleton was seen with Buffy Rice Donohue the day she vanished from a Montrose parking lot in 1993 . Hearing the news and frantic with worry , Donohue 's mother confronted Middleton . Montrose police heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no physical evidence linking him to Donohue 's disappearance . The cops ticketed Donohue 's mom for trespassing on Middleton 's property . Then they talked to Middleton and let him go on his way . <p> Donohue 's remains were found on the Western Slope this past spring . She was an 18-year-old newlywed . <p> Long before Donohue 's body was found , Middleton had moved to Reno . Last week he was ordered to stand trial in the murders of two women there . <p> Middleton says he is innocent . " He did n't kill anybody , " said defense attornev Michael Specchio , a Nevada public defender . " We have no idea who did , but he did n't , and that goes for Colorado , too . " <p> In Reno Justice Court , with shackles on his hands and feet , Middleton sat impassively as Washoe County prosecutors painted a gruesome picture of him as a killer . They entered photos and items into evidence that still whispered the presence of the dead women . Then police described torture devices  --  a homemade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middleton possessed . <p> " It 's a thin line between cop and criminal , " Washoe County Assistant District Attorney Tom Viloria was overheard saying during a break in testimony . Middleton looked at the prosecutor and smiled . <p> Florida : The beginning <p> Not much is known about Middleton before he became a cop . But prosecutors who have watched him since his days serving warrants in muggy Miami say they can track him through a trail of tears . <p> A Boston police cadet , Middleton fled the Northeast when he was hired in 1982 by the Metro-Dade County , Fla. , Police Department . He initially racked up commendations in Miami , but his record soon was tarnished . Middleton started a business on the side without notifying police supervisors . He socialized with criminals . He wrote letters on police department letterhead on behalf of convicts . <p> " He was pretty smug , " said Kathleen Hoague , an assistant state attorney in Florida who would become the first prosecutor to face Middleton in court . <p> As the years rolled by , Hoague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prey on the most defenseless women he could find . He worked regular day shifts and was off weekends , but Hoague believes he dressed in his police uniform at night and went looking for young runaways . This , she says , was a prelude to the many allegations that he has kidnapped and murdered women in the West . <p> " I think that 's where he was heading . He has some problems that center around control and domination of women . I do n't believe he killed anyone here ( in Florida ) , but I think he was moving in that direction , " Hoague said . <p> A 25-cent charge at a toll booth brought Middleton down in Miami . It happened this way : <p> On Sept. 29 , 1990 , he was off duty but in uniform . He picked up a 16-year-old girl who had gotten out of her boyfriend 's car after an argument . Middleton questioned the girl about being out so late . He threatened to send her to juvenile detention . Then , prosecutors say , he handcuffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police car . <p> " He got into his uniform and would go on what I call ' trolling , ' " Hoague said . " I have no actual evidence , but I do n't think this was the first time . " Her opinion was based on other evidence , including Middleton 's demeanor . <p> " He thinks he 's a lot smarter than he is  --  very cocky , " Hoague said . " When we arrested him , we did a search and confiscated two videotapes , and one was him and a Metro-Dade secretary having sex in the DUI room . " <p> " The other was a tape of him with several different prostitutes . It was not like he was enjoying it , but more like he just wanted to tape himself and some sadomosochistic stuff . It was obvious one woamn was in pain and he did n't care . " <p> A moment of frugality linked Middleton to the rape of the 16-year-old , who went to police and insisted that one of their own had attacked her . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer would be an almost impossible task . Middleton was caught only because the girl remembered that he used a county-issued credit card to pay a 25-cent charge at a toll booth . A check of the records showed that Middleton had used the card during the night the girl said she was raped . <p> In 1991 , Middleton went on trial for rape and false imprisonment . A jury found him guilty of holding the teenager against her will , but deadlocked on the rape charge . A deal averted a retrial . Middleton pleaded to a lesser charge - aggravated battery - and was sentenced to five years in prison . <p> On to Colorado <p> After his release from prison , on June 25 , 1993 , his 32nd birthday , Middleton joined his girlfriend , Evonne Haley , in Colorado . Haley and Middleton had met in Miami in 1984 . <p> " He was a police officer and I was a stripper , and that man got me out of it , " Haley said crying . " He saved my life . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so she knew the Western Slope . Middleton moved into a Montrose apartment with Haley and her children . He left an ex-wife and two children of his own in Miami . Haley , a small woman with a husky voice , describes their life together in Colorado . " I worked at the Sizzler and David worked for a hillbilly , putting up siding . " <p> The Western Sizzler restaurant also is where Haley met Buffy Rice Donohue . They worked together . <p> Donohue , 5-feet-1 with a full head of blond hair , had just married Mason Donohue . And Mason had befriended Middleton . The Donohues were living with her parents , Walt and Bonnie Rice , while they saved for a place of their own . On Nov. 21 , 1993 , Buffy Donohue went to the store on a family errand . She never returned . <p> That night , she was seen getting into a car with Evonne Haley in the Wal-Mart parking lot . The Rices questioned Haley 's young daughter , who told them that Donohue left their apartment with Middleton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child said . <p> Buffy Rice Donohue 's skeletal remains were found last May 24 . The discovery was made by hikers in San Miguel County , about 40 miles from her home . Bonnie Rice said her daughter had been bound and gagged . <p> Middleton , Haley and her children left Montrose shortly after Donohue 's disappearance . <p> " I always believed he did it , " Donohue 's mother said last week . She and her husband traveled to Reno to attend Middleton 's preliminary hearing in the murders of two Nevada women . <p> Tom Chinn , a Montrose police detective said he had no evidence to hold Middleton in Buffy Rice Donohue 's disappearance . <p> " We were concerned that he left , but there was not a thing we could have done , " Chinn said . " He was one of hundreds of suspects and ( Buffy ) being a runaway was still a possibility . I never had a good grip on what happened , but as time progressed it became more apparent what might have happened . " <p> Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Reno in October 1994 to again interview Middleton . At that time , he notified Reno authorities that Middleton was in their area and that he was a suspect in Donohue 's disappearance . <p> By then , Middleton was working as a cable TV installer , and an introverted woman named Thelma Davila had vanished . <p> Nevada : end of the line <p> Davila , a 42-year-old porter at the Circus Circus hotel-casino , recently had a cable box installed in her apartment . She last was seen alive on Aug. 8 , 1994 , lying on her sofa , wrapped in a blanket and watching television . <p> She and her sister , Dora Valverde , lived together in a battered apartment complex in Sparks , just east of Reno . Neighbors said the women were quiet but nice . <p> When Valverde returned from work , she noticed that a plant had been knocked over . The blanket was gone and so was her sister . Valverde made a missing persons report after she learned that her always-reliable sister had not shown up for work or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valverde cried continually during Middleton 's hearing last week . She and her sister moved to Nevada from California four years ago . Davila always went to work , always was on time and , with the exception of a relationship that ended more than a year ago , brought no men to the apartment . <p> Davila 's remains were found in a field near Verdi , Nev. , last April 9 . Animals had scattered the bones , but a white nylon-like rope was found near the skeleton . Human flesh was decomposing inside nearby garbage bags . <p> As Reno police scrambled to find out what happened to Davila , they had another , similar case to worry about . Katherine Powell , 45 , a teacher at Sun Valley Elementary School , disappeared from her Reno-area home last Feb. 4 or Feb. 5 . Then someone used her credit card to purchase a stereo receiver . <p> The woman who picked up the stereo from the Good Guys electronic store matched the description of Evonne Haley . Six days later Powell 's body was found in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Police say her body had been in the rubble for about two hours when a transient found it in the bin . <p> She , too , was bound by a white nylon rope and covered with trash bags . Blue fibers were found on the upper portion of her body . She was nude except for black socks and a haltertype black top . Powell 's body had human bite marks made while she still was alive . <p> Raymond Rawsen , a specialist in forensic dentistry , said Middleton 's " teeth are unique . The marks on the breast of Katherine Powell were made by David Middleton . " <p> Middleton admits he knew Powell . He claims he had a consensual sexual relationship with her . He said he left her home after having sex with her on one occasion , returned an hour later and found her dead . Panicked , he would later tell Reno police Detective David Jenkins that he disposed of her body . <p> Outside the courthouse , Jody Murphy , Powell 's close friend , said the sight of Middleton makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , " she said . Powell had received a doctorate degree but had no plans to become an administrator . She loved teaching , and children loved her . " It was devastating to them , " Murphy said of Powell 's students . " Several kids are still having a hard time with it . " <p> Because Powell was found shortly after her death , her body provided the most clues as to her killer , and perhaps to the killer of Davila and Donohue . <p> Nevada prosecutors are trying to connect the murders of Powell and Davila through the rope and plastic bags used to contain both of their bodies . Detective Jenkins was called to highlight those clues during Middleton 's hearing . With the clarity of a bad dream , he described the findings of a search of a Reno storage shed believed to have been rented by Middleton on the day Davila disappeared . <p> The evidence includes a small hand truck and a yellow wind breaker . The woman who used Powell 's credit card wore such a jacket and used such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . Inside an old refrigerator were blue fibers . " I recognized them because they were consistent with those on the body of Kathy Powell , " Jenkins said . <p> The refrigerator had been modified . Its freezer compartment had been cut and bent down to make one large opening . Holes had been drilled in the front and sides . The district attorney called these " air holes . " In addition , there was a large black box attached to a pulley system . The pulleys allowed the device to be hoisted to the ceiling , Jenkins said . <p> A stun gun , handcuffs , human bondage materials , sexual paraphernalia , various sizes of women 's lingerie , and two handguns - one Middleton is believed to have qualified with to become a Florida police officer - were found inside the storage unit . Several items of Powell 's personal property also were there , along with a blanket matching the one Valverde last had seen her sister covered with and a photo . Prosecutor Viloria told the Rices he believes the photo is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is suing TCI Cablevision of Nevada for $ 10,000 , claiming the company did n't screen Middleton before they hired him to install a cable box in her daughter 's home . Davila also had cable installed in her home prior to her disappearance but prosecutors have yet to connect Midlleton to Davila through cable-TV work . <p> Reno police have conducted DNA tests on hair and fibers found in the storage unit with samples taken from Davila and Powell . The Colorado Bureau of Investigation and private labs are performing the same test to see if Middleton can be linked to Donohue or to Cindy Booth , 14 , a Delta girl who vanished soon after Middleton moved to Montrose . <p> " When you 're working a huge case and you 're looking at numerous hairs and fibers , you get this mental picture of the case , " said David Atkinson , criminologist with the Washoe County sheriff 's office . " Then , when you have another one ( victim ) come through and there is a match , it 's just good fortune . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think Montrose is ever going to get ( to prosecute ) Middleton . " <p> Middleton , who declined requests for a jailhouse interview , was ordered by Justice of the Peace Fidel Salcedo to stand trial for the murders of Powell and Davila . He is represented by four lawyers from the Nevada public defender 's office . <p> " He 's very concerned , " defense attorney Specchio said . " He 's had a lot of depression and has been prescribed medication . This is a difficult process to go through , especially for a black man in this county . " <p> Police say Reno - where the sun creates bright days and neon defines its nights - is the end of the trail for the ex-Florida cop . " He has n't admitted to anything , " Atkinson said , " but the data we have on him is excellent .
