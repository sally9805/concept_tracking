<p> A peculiar convergence of critics on the left and right has begun to emerge as Americans digest the enormity of the Persian Gulf crisis . It came as such a surprise and built up so rapidly that many thought it a passing storm at first , a nasty adventure like Panama that could be put in its place and then out of mind . <p> It never was . But the issues remain muddled in the novelty of a truly international operation crisscrossing old alliances . The arguments about saving feudal emirs and cheap oil sound persuasive to many because it is hard to face the deeper questions . <p> Does the world still need policing ? In what circumstances ? If it 's a matter of principle , why is n't it applied everywhere , equally ? Should the U.S. do it ? If so , how ? To inveterate cold warriors on the right , the answers are no . The U.S. function was to confront Communism , and if that is n't necessary there is no reason to get involved in the quarrels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over-accustomed to U.S. protection . Everything has changed . On the left , the reflexes instilled by the Vietnam War are stirred . They resonate with the familiar vocabulary and gestures , as though nothing had changed . <p> A group in Paris calling itself Americans for Peace has issued " Bulletin No. 1 . " It calls for a demonstration picketing the U.S. Embassy with such slogans as " Blood is more precious than oil , " " Let the diplomats do it , " " Make peace not war . " <p> Nobody could gainsay these slogans , but they do n't suggest how to make peace or how the diplomats should do it . Leaving Iraq 's Saddam Hussein triumphant would be no guarantee , to understate it . <p> In other parts of the world , existing commitments and emotional allegiances also take precedence over the challenge . Japan 's Socialist Party leader , Takako Doi , opposes sending any Japanese to the gulf , except perhaps to look after refugees , and opposes even the use of United Nations force . " The U.N . is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means no force . " <p> A Japanese businessman asked me recently , " Will we regret the cold war ? " Indeed , it seemed easier to sort out friend and foe when people imagined that a single test was all that really mattered . The answer to his question may be yes , if we do n't make new rules . <p> There is still a test , but it is not so simple . It is the maintenance of a reasonably orderly world . The history of civilizations is one of enormous violence , with widespread desolation whenever the foundations of order failed . We are entering a new period at a time when nations are tied in mutual dependencies as never before , inescapably vulnerable to each other 's actions and upheavals . <p> True , some benefit more than others from the kind of order that the liberal democracies have been trying to establish . But it is a dangerous illusion to think that third-world countries would be better off left to look after their own needs and their own conflicts . That is one reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join in the attempt to make new , cooperative rules . All would be hurt in a free-for-all . <p> Peace and order do not come of themselves . Entropy applies to society on a national and global scale as well as to thermodynamics . It takes policing to sustain a rule of law , and even then police ca n't eradicate crime , only make it unrewarding . <p> There is no world police , and precious little international law . But the fact that the U.S. sometimes did badly when it tried to substitute its own will for both does not mean the world can do without rule-keeping . And the fact that the U.S. can not do it alone does not mean it should reject the responsibility of its capacity . <p> This new period is the stumbling beginning of an attempt to organize the world in the purposes for which the United Nations was established . The difficulties are obvious , but less daunting than the need . Nor can the ideal goal of satisfying all grievances , assuring an end to all military violence , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The powers did nothing about the bloody civil war in Liberia , and the West African states that intervened did it poorly . Lebanon has fared no better . That 's a shame , but it does n't justify never intervening . If Iraq is different , it is because the strategic importance of oil to everybody and the fragility of Arab states make the stakes higher and more general . <p> This is n't about American hegemony , nor the right to guzzle gas as the " American way of life . " It 's a step toward a community of security and standards by consent .
