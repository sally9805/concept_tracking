Section : Previews BUREAUCRACY <p> In the days of the military dictatorship , in the middle of i973 , a Uruguayan political prisoner , Juan Jose Noueched , received a five-day punishment : five days without visitation rights or exercise ; five days without anything , for having violated the rule . From the point of view of the captain who imposed the punishment , the rule left no room for argument . The rule clearly established that prisoners must walk single file and with both hands behind their back . Noueched had been punished for putting only one . hand behind his back . Noueched was one-armed . He had been taken prisoner in two stages . First , his arm was taken . Then he was . His arm was taken in Montevideo . Noueched was escaping as fast as his legs could carry him when the policeman chasing him managed to grab him and shout : " You 're under arrest ! " and found himself holding the arm . The rest of Noueched was taken a year and a half later , in Paysandu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back : <p> " Fill out a request form , " they told him . <p> He explained that he did n't have a pencil : <p> " Fill out a request for a pencil , " they told him . <p> Then he had a pencil , but no paper : <p> " Fill out a request for paper , " they told him . <p> When at last he had pencil and paper , he wrote out a re quest for his arm . <p> Eventually , he got an answer . No . It was n't possible : His arm was under different jurisdiction . He had been tried in a military court . His arm had been tried as a civilian . <p> Sixto Martinez completed his military service at a barracks in Seville . <p> In the middle of the courtyard of that barracks was a small bench . Next to the small bench , a soldier stood guard . No one knew why the bench had to be guarded . The bench was guarded around the clock , just because : every day , every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next , the order was passed on and the soldiers obeyed it . No one expressed any doubts or ever asked why . If that 's how it was done , and that 's how it had always been done , there had to be a reason . <p> And so it continued until someone , some general or colonel , wanted to look at the original order . He had to rummage through all the files . After a good deal of poking around , he found the answer . Thirty-one years , two months , and four days ago , an officer had ordered a guard to be stationed beside the small bench , which had just been painted , so that no one would think of sitting on the wet paint . NOBODIES <p> Fleas dream of buying themselves a dog , and nobodies dream of escaping poverty : that one magical day good luck will suddenly rain down on them-will rain down in buckets . But good luck does n't rain down yesterday , today , tomorrow , or ever . Good luck does n't even fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobodies summon it , even if they prick their left hand , or raise their right foot , or start the new year with a change of brooms . <p> The nobodies : nobody 's children , owners of nothing . The nobodies : the no ones , the nobodies , running like rabbits , dying through life , screwed every which way . <p> Who are not , but could be . <p> Who do n't speak languages , but dialects . <p> Who do n't have religion , but superstitions . <p> Who do n't create art , but handicrafts . <p> Who do n't have culture , but folklore . <p> Who are n't human beings , but human resources . <p> Who do n't have faces , but arms . <p> Who do n't have names , but numbers . <p> Who do n't appear in the history of the world , but in the police blotter of the local paper . <p> The nobodies , who are not worth the bullet that kills them . THEOLOGY <p> When I was very young , the catechism taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to do evil for fear of the consequences . God offered me punishments and rewards : he threatened me with hell and promised me heaven . And I feared and believed . <p> Time has gone by . I am neither afraid nor a believer . And anyway , it seems to me that if I deserve to be roasted on a spit over a slow , eternal flame , so it will be . That way , I 'll escape purgatory , which will be packed with dreadful middle-class tourists , and in the end , justice will be done . <p> Frankly , as deserving goes , I deserve it . I have never killed anyone , it 's true , but for lack of courage or time , not for lack of desire . I do n't go to mass on Sundays or days of obligation . I have coveted almost all of my neighbors ' women , except for the ugly ones , and thus have desecrated , at least in my heart , the private property that God himself sanctified in Moses ' tables : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ox , or his ass .... And to top it all , I have , with premeditation and in cold blood , committed the act of love without the noble intention of reproducing the labor force . I am acutely aware that carnal sins are very poorly regarded in heaven , but I suspect that God damns what he does not know . <p> The god of the Christians , God of my childhood , does not make love . He is perhaps the only god that has never made love , out of all the gods of all the religions in the history of the world . Whenever this occurs to me , I feel sorry for him . And then I forgive him for having been my superfather castigator , chief of police of the universe , and I think that when all is said and done , God also knew how to be my friend in the old days when I believed in Him and believed that He believed in me . Then I prick up my ears at the time of day when the world is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun and the fall of night , and I seem to hear his melancholy confidences . FINGERPRINTS <p> I was born and raised under the stars of the Southern Cross . <p> Wherever I go , they follow me . Under the sparkling Southern Cross , I live out the stages of my fate . <p> I have no god . If I had one , I would beseech him not to let me meet death , not yet . I still have a long way to go . There are moons at which I have not yet howled and suns that have not yet set me alight . I have still not swum in all the seas of the world , of which they say there are seven , nor in all the rivers of Paradise , of which they say there are four . <p> In Montevideo , a child explains : <p> " I never want to die , because I want to play forever . " PROFESSIONAL LIFE <p> They have the same first name , the same surname . They live in the same house and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillow , next to the same woman . Every morning the mirror confronts them with the same face . But he and he are not the same person : <p> " And I , what have I got to do with it ? " says he , speaking of him and shrugging his shoulders . <p> " I carry out orders , " he says . <p> Or he says : <p> " That 's what they pay me for . " <p> Or he says : <p> " If I do n't do it , someone else will . " <p> Which is as if to say : <p> " I am someone else . " <p> The hatred of the victim astonishes the executioner , and even leaves him feeling a certain sense of injustice : after all , he is an official , an ordinary official who goes to work on time and does his job . When the exhausting day 's work is done , the torturer washes his hands . <p> Ahmadou Gherab , who fought for the independence of Algeria , told me this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every day , promptly at 6:00 P.M. , the torturer would wipe the sweat from his brow , unplug the electric cattle prod , and put away the other tools of his trade . Then he would sit beside the tortured man and speak to him of his family problems and of the promotion that did n't come and of how expensive life is . The torturer would speak of his insufferable wife and their newborn child , who had not permitted him a wink of sleep all night ; he railed against Oran , that shitty city , and against the son-of-a-bitch colonel , who ... <p> Ahmadou , bathed in blood , trembling with pain , burning with fever , would say nothing . THE PERFECT CRIME <p> This is the way things work in London : the radiators give out heat in exchange for the coins they receive . And in midwinter , several Latin American exiles were shivering in the cold , without a single coin for the heater in their flat . <p> They stared , without blinking , at the radiator . They looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor shipwrecked sailors considering how to finish off the British Empire . If they put in coins of tin or cardboard , the radiator would work , but later on the collector would find the evidence of their infamy . <p> What to do ? they asked themselves . The cold was making them tremble as if they had malaria . All at once , one of them let out a savage cry that shook the foundations of western civilization . And so , the ice coin was born , invented by a poor frozen man . <p> They got to work right away . They made wax molds that perfectly reproduced British coins , then they filled the molds with water and put them in the freezer . <p> The ice coins left no trace because the heat evaporated them . <p> And thus , that London flat was turned into a Caribbean beach . HOMINGS <p> In Buenos Aires , I looked for my old cafe and could n't find it . I looked for the restaurant where I used to eat enormous platters of caracu at all hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there either . Where my favorite bar , the Bachin , had stood , was a mountain of rubble . They had torn down the Bachin and , with it , had killed the market where I always would go to buy fruit and flowers or just to partake of that feast for the nose and the eyes . Somebody told me the Bachin had moved , and that it was now located somewhere else under another name . <p> I went there one night . I stood outside the door to this new Bachin , which no longer called itself by that name , unsure , yes or no , wondering whether it would constitute betrayal to go in , when a sudden explosion occurred just as I opened the door : the fuses blew and everything was thrown into darkness . I turned around and walked slowly away . <p> And so I walked for a while , aching with forgotten memories , searching for places and people I did n't find or did n't know how to find , and finally I crossed the river , the river-ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still in power , on their way out . It was almost goodbye to the time of terror . I entered , crossing my fingers , and I was lucky . <p> And walking the streets of the city where I was born , I began to recognize it and felt I was returning without ever having left : Montevideo , sleeping its eternal siesta on the sloping hills of the coast , indifferent to the wind that beats on it and calls to it ; Montevideo , boring and beloved , smelling of bread in the summer and smoke in the winter . And I knew I had been longing for home and that the hour for ending my exile had struck . After wandering through many seas , the salmon swims in search of its river , finds it , and swims back up it , guided by the smell of the water to the stream where it was born . <p> Then , when I returned to Calella to say goodbye , goodbye to Spain , goodbye and thanks , I had a heart attack . <p> PHOTO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a personal memoir to be published in April by W.W.
