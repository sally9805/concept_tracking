The future is n't what it used to be . Take Tomorrowland . When it opened in 1955 as one of the five original sections of Disneyland , Walt Disney himself appeared on the live opening-day telecast and promised " a step into the future with constructive predictions about things to come . " He may have been a dull public speaker , but in envisioning " the world of 1987 , " as it was at one point conceived , he did offer up such astounding attractions as TWA 's Rocket to the Moon and Monsanto 's all-plastic House of the Future ( " Hardly a natural material appears anywhere " ) . We now know that people still live in wood and brick houses ; and that even if TWA did fly to the moon , no one would go because the service would be ghastly ; and that if Disney could have given 1950s parkgoers a genuine look at the future , the most amazing thing about 1987 would have been the presidency of Ronald Reagan , who was an opening-telecast co-host , along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the century 's most enthusiastic futurists , was never one to let the unknowability of man 's fate get in the way of a good show . We should n't laugh at his earnest , hopeful visions , just as people of the future should n't laugh at ours ( computers in every classroom ! peace through global trade ! a cleaned-up Jerry Springer ! ) . <P> One wonders what Disney would have made of the latest Tomorrowland , which opens to the public this Friday after undergoing its first complete makeover in more than 30 years . The thrill rides and **30;6421;TOOLONG displays will still be in evidence . What is noteworthy is the new design scheme , which , instead of purporting to give us a fanciful if sincere glimpse of life in the 21st century , takes hodgepodge inspiration from the 1939 New York World 's Fair , Jules Verne novels and even Leonardo da Vinci 's notebooks , to name just a few sources . The new flying rockets look more Flash Gordon than NASA ; the cars for a high-speed roller coaster-like attraction suggest a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tim Burton . In the grand tradition of Disney artifice , the new Tomorrowland is an oxymoron made manifest : " a classic future environment , " in the words of a park press release . In short , it is a perfect Tomorrowland for the Nick at Nite generation . ( Of course , they could have saved some money and just put colossal quotation marks around the entrance to the old Tomorrowland , but that probably would have been too arch for most people 's tastes . ) <P> It 's not a novel observation to point out that our culture has become increasingly backward looking . But you have to pause when even people who are supposed to look ahead start going all retro on us . It 's not just Disney . One of the most striking trends in architecture is what you might call amodernism : buildings  --  like the new ball parks in Cleveland , Ohio , and Baltimore , Md. , or the new performing-arts center in Fort Worth , Texas  --  that do n't just make clever nods to the past but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the prime selling point in automotive design ; today the most talked-about new car is Volkswagen 's redo of the Beetle . Steve Jobs ' reformed Apple , meanwhile , hopes the public will fall in love with a new home computer , the iMac , whose design was inspired in part by The Jetsons , a 30-year-old cartoon parody of the high-tech world made real by guys like Jobs .
