Section : Society For the journey everyone must face , Cardinal Joseph Bernardin illuminated the trail <p> IT WAS A HUMID NIGHT IN AUGUST , AND 200 members of Congregation B'Nai Jehoshua Beth Elohim were gathered in the leafy Chicago suburb of Glenview for Friday services . Rabbi Mark Shapiro began the Me sh'bayrach , the prayer for healing , then asked the congregation to offer names of those in need . Cardinal Joseph Bernardin , ' someone said , and suddenly an agitated murmur ran through the congregation . Not everyone there had seen the press conference , televised that afternoon , where Bernardin had calmly announced that his cancer had returned , invading his liver , and that he had n't long to live . Bernardin was not of their faith , but he was , for many of them , their cardinal : I am Joseph , your brother , ' the Archbishop of Chicago liked to say . Each one of us was being punched in the stomach , ' recalls Sandee Holleb , a schoolteacher who was in the congregation that night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached out to embrace the world  --  and us . ' <p> At 1:33 last Thursday morning , death came for the archbishop . It was his mother 's 92d birthday and 62 years to the day that his father had succumbed to cancer . The cardinal was 68 . All night long , a vigil of reporters and faithful had milled outside the cardinal 's hulking red-brick residence near Lincoln Park , anticipating his end . Only 24 hours earlier , he had been well enough to nod goodbye to close friends , silently sipping a soft drink in his bed . On his last day , he took phone calls from Pope John Paul II and President Clinton . But his energy was ebbing . As news of his death washed across Chicago , those of faith and those of none went into mourning for a churchman whom they had come to cherish as Joseph , their brother . <p> Despite his pain and weakness , the cardinal 's final week was surprisingly productive . One of his last acts was to sign off on the manuscript of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page 67 ) , scrawling notes in the margins . There was a report on archdiocesan affairs for the Vatican , his will to review and arrangements to make for his mother , whom he had visited every day at a Chicago nursing home until he could no longer walk . He also dispatched three letters , his last as the foremost spokesman for the Roman Catholic Church in the United States . In one , to the United States Supreme Court , he asked the justices to reject arguments that the dying have a right to a physician-assisted suicide . As one who is dying , I have especially come to appreciate the gift of life , ' Bernardin wrote . Creating a new right to assisted suicide will endanger society and send a false signal that a less than perfect ' life is not worth living . ' A second , handwritten note bade farewell to his fellow bishops , who were meeting in Washington , D.C. , asking them for their prayers that God will give me the strength and grace I need each day . ' The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends . At his request , they were mailed early . His parting to those who came to say goodbye was to squeeze their hand , asking with his eyes that they walk his final journey with him . <p> In many ways , Bernardin died an enviable death . He was given the grace of three months to prepare for the end we all face , to reconcile himself with God and those he may have neglected . That day last August when he learned his cancer was terminal , he made a public promise : to use whatever time was left in a way that will be of benefit to the priests and people I have been called to serve . ' There were , he felt , lessons of faith yet to be learned , and lessons of dying yet to be taught . A public man , he chose to die a public death . <p> It was never as easy as he tried to make it look . To begin with , there was the constant pain . He suffered from spinal stenosis and osteoporosis to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he snapped a rib . The first lesson we learn from the cardinal is that dying is as horrible as we thought , ' says University of Chicago church historian Martin E. Marty , a Lutheran minister who regularly entertained Bernardin in his home . He was living with sadness and pain and doubt . ' Doubt ? Did he ever ask Why me ? ' Of course , ' says Bishop Robert Lynch of St. Petersburg , Fla. , a confidant of Bernardin 's . Did he ever ask Why so soon ? ' Of course . ' <p> Indeed , like every other person who learns he has a virulent form of cancer , the cardinal had to come to grips with elemental fear . His father had died of cancer  --  something that had always haunted the cardinal  --  and now he faced the same prospect . There is a long Christian tradition , dating to the apostle Paul , which sees death as alien , an enemy , the punishment visited on humankind by God for the original sin ' of Adam . Bernardin had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priest , Father Henri Nouwen , a widely revered writer on spirituality who died himself last September , Bernardin gradually came to see death as a friend . ' The churchman who had always been confident of his control had to learn to let go , to let death be . That , too , was a lesson he passed on to others . <p> THEN THERE WAS THE lesson of his openness and honesty . The dying typically find it difficult to talk about what is happening to them . Bernardin refused to piously dissemble about his own fears and failing health . When he spoke , his words were without false sentiment or bravado . His way of death confirms that this man did not have two faces , one private , one public , ' says Rabbi Herman Schaalman , an old friend . He was inside with his outside , outside with his inside , which is rare . ' <p> For Bernardin , more than words , there were deeds . When he first learned that he had cancer , 17 months earlier , he began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrinal lines to cross , no geographical boundaries . His first recruits were fellow patients at Loyola University 's Cancer Center , now named after him . When he arrived for chemotherapy , he refused to use a private entrance offered him . I am a priest , ' he explained , and he never left without visiting and encouraging all the other patients . Often , he would follow up with phone calls , letters and visits at crucial moments , delegating his duties as archbishop to his staff . Very quickly , his parish ' included a list of 600 others like himself . He was spreading hope , and an attitude of me , too ' , ' says Maureen Fuechtmann , director of ministry at Loyola . As a chaplain , I can bring compassion , but I ca n't bring that . ' He also made time to visit parishes to anoint the sick . And on one occasion he consoled a prisoner about to be executed , telling him that they had at least one thing in common : a sentence of death . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confront our own . As a Christian , Bernardin approached death with the conviction that it is a transition from earthly life to life eternal . ' And that confidence may be the most important lesson that he  --  or any believer  --  has to teach . But , as historian Marty observes , a strong majority of Americans share that belief , yet they live in terror of death . ' Much of that terror is fear of the unknown and the prospect of annihilation . Clinicians can only tell us what happens to the body when death occurs ( page 64 ) . But the moment of death that matters is what happens to me . <p> Every major religion offers a vision of transcendence  --  and thus a response to life 's ultimate enigma . If Jews , Christians and Muslims fear death , Hindus and Buddhists fear rebirth . Their hope is to be reborn as a well-placed human being or , preferably , as a god . Nirvana , or liberation from rebirth altogether , is a far-off goal . The law of karma holds that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the one seed that determines whether the next birth will be as god or demon , man or moth . At the point of death , one of our past acts is going to be selected as the cause of the next lifetime , ' says Donald Lopez , professor of Buddhism at the University of Michigan . Since the moment of death is so traumatic , your final state of mind is always a reflection of the qualities you exhibited through your life . ' <p> Muslims also believe that a good life is the best guarantee of a good death . In the Muslim popular imagination , an Angel of Death comes for the departing soul , as it did for the Prophet Muhammad . But unlike the Prophet , ordinary Muslims must confront the books of deeds of their lives and undergo judgment of heaven or hell . The ideal , says Ali Asani , a Muslim professor at Harvard University , is that at your last breath you are able to proclaim your submission to the one God . ' Jews share a similar desire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Talmud describes exemplary deaths of ancient sages . How did the martyred Rabbi Akiva die ? With the final words of the Shema on his lips , The Lord is One ! ' With typical simplicity , the late Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel once said , I trust the God who made me to do with me what He will . ' <p> The Christian finds death 's meaning in the figure of the suffering Savior who abandons himself in perfect obedience to the Father 's will . The Christian 's hope is that at the moment of death he will be able to say , with Jesus , Father , into your hands I commit my spirit . ' In the view of the late Jesuit theologian Karl Rahner , death is an act in which the person either willingly accepts or definitively rebels against his own utter impotence , in which he is utterly subject to a mystery which can not be expressed , that mystery which we call God ' . ' <p> But the great religions have no monopoly on death . Indeed , increasingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of technicians , those who fibrillate and ventilate , trache and tube , plug and unplug . The culture itself is a monument to youth , acutely uncomfortable with aging . When death approaches , we are stunned and feel unprepared , ' Dr. Ira Byock , president of the Academy of Hospice Physicians , writes in his new book , Dying Well . ' His work , like Bernardin 's final days , argues that good deaths can be understood and fostered . ' How ? Among other things : repair relationships , respect the patient 's integrity , help the dying to live as fully as possible , reduce pain , allow time and space for transcendence and letting go . ' In any tradition , a good life is the best preparation for a good death . Belief alone is no substitute for genuine self-abandonment . Indeed , being a bishop , and especially a cardinal , can actually hinder the kind of spiritual development needed for the peaceful acceptance of God 's will . Every cleric runs the danger of turning into a professional holy man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who served as confessor and traveling companion to Bernardin . He showed us saintly qualities , but he was n't always that way . ' <p> As the cardinal himself came to realize , his very success on the ecclesiastical fast track nearly caused his spiritual life to derail . The son of poor Italian immigrants , Bernardin grew up in the South . His first cassock was hand-sewn by his mother , who became a seamstress after her stonecutter husband died when Joseph was 6 . At 38 , he became the youngest Catholic bishop in the United States . Do n't look pleased with yourself , ' his mother warned before he received his bishop 's miter . <p> Bernardin was good at administration and was named the first general secretary of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops , created in 1967 after Vatican Council II . The bishops  --  especially the cardinals  --  were not accustomed to acting collegially , but Bernardin was expert at reconciling differing opinions and egos . In 1972 Bernardin was appointed Archbishop of Cincinnati . Two years later he was elected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the World Synod of Bishops in Rome . <p> Up to that point , Bernardin had been more administrator than priest , an ecclesiastical negotiator always on the fly . In the early ' 80s , he chaired a committee of bishops that produced a knowing and nuanced updating of the just-war theory for the nuclear age that put the Roman Catholic hierarchy in conflict with the Reagan administration . But the public and private man were not in spiritual sync . Pale and hugely overweight , he was the very image of the self-indulgent prelate . Sensing that something was wrong with his life , he asked a group of parish priests if he could join their prayer group . They accepted him but immediately challenged his priorities . They asked him if his life was Christ-centered or centered on the Church Bureaucratic , ' says Eugene Kennedy , Bernardin 's close friend and biographer . The archbishop took their challenge to heart . He lost weight and began rising each morning at 5 to devote the first hour of the day to prayer and meditation on Christ . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lynch of St. Petersburg . He gave away money , objects of art and other things he felt were concerns that were more materialistic than spiritual . ' In 1982 he was appointed Archbishop of Chicago , then the largest Roman Catholic see in the United States . Six months later John Paul II named him a cardinal . <p> The priests of Chicago , an independent bunch not much given to accepting authority , soon found they had a different sort of leader . In his first address to them , Bernardin said , I hope that before my name falls from the Eucharist prayer in the silence of death you will know well who I am . You will know because we will work and play together , fast and pray together , mourn and rejoice together , despair and hope together , dispute and be reconciled together . You will know me as a friend , fellow priest and bishop . You will know also that I love you . ' And then came what was to be his signature line : For I am Joseph , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bernardin continued to shape the public face of American Catholicism . In a far-reaching speech in 1990 , he defined for Roman Catholics the seamless garment ' ethic , which united church opposition to abortion , euthanasia , capital punishment , poverty and the nuclear-arms race in a consistent ethic of life . ' But it was only in the last three years , many of his friends and fellow bishops believe , that Bernardin the man finally experienced the kind of spiritual liberation all Christians hope to achieve . <p> In November 1993 , a former seminarian from Cincinnati , Steven Cook , charged on television that Bernardin had sexually abused him years earlier . Bernardin 's ministry , his priestly vows , his integrity , his entire life had been called into question . Calmly , without rancor , he stepped before a crowded press conference and denied the charges . Cook later recanted ; his recovered memory ' of abuse turned out to be false . And in 1994 , when Cook was dying of AIDS , Bernardin said mass for him and anointed him in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accuser 's dignity . <p> For Bernardin , the Cook episode was a painful purgation , a public stripping to the flesh that left him with only his faith to rely on . Less than six months later , he learned he had cancer of the pancreas . And just when he thought that surgery had put him out of danger , an examination in August confirmed that resurgent cancer cells were now destroying his liver . This time there would be no reprieve . He could see all the way to the end of his life . And the end , he knew , was near . <p> In a final act of churchmanship , Bernardin launched Project Common Ground , an effort to heal the rift between American Catholics of the left and right . But among the nation 's cardinals , only Roger Mahoney of Los Angeles stood with him . As his fax machine brought word of blistering criticism from the cardinal-archbishops of New York , Boston , Philadelphia and Washington , D.C. , Bernardin responded with wry humor . Who says there is no dissent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flags of Chicago flew at half mast for the cardinal . On the front steps of his red-brick mansion , mourners left mementos : notes of condolence , snapshots of the cardinal , Jewish memorial candles . Two workers for the city 's Streets and Sanitation Department stopped their truck to leave a clutch of flowers . On a wall , someone drew three crosses and scrawled in chalk , THANK YOU JOSEPH . In dying , Cardinal Bernardin gave new and authentic definition to a phrase he feared had lost its meaning .
