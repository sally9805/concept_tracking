In a cabin tucked away in a cubbyhole hollow at Sundance , Utah , Robert Redford , squire of Sundance and America 's most cinegenic ski-area owner , was doing a little reminiscing . He was talking about skiing , something he likes talking about . His voice was swelling with that mix of heightened pitch and snap that tends to slip into a voice when someone gets animated . Of the many days he has skied at Sundance , Redford was recalling one in particular : " It was morning and fresh and it had just snowed , snowed close to two feet . The storm had just passed through an hour before , and the sun had come out . We skied Bishop 's Bowl , across and down , just kept moving , just kept going , all the way through the powder . It had a lot to do with the moment , the way the sun was , the crispness of the air . There was a glistening feeling in the snow , as if the snow were alive . " Now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe you can . Maybe the moment was that magical . But there was more than magic in this bit of memory . There was bittersweet anguish in it , too . Robert Redford loves skiing , and he just ca n't stand it . That 's because a love of skiing has made for awkward baggage on Redford 's 20-year journey into the heart of environmental consciousness . It troubles him . Here 's a guy who has committed himself to the big environmental issues : the perils of global warming and resource mismanagement . Closer to home , he has stood up , successfully , against efforts to bulldoze a highway through Provo Canyon . In 1968 , in a move of preservationist panic , he bought a 5,000-acre former sheep ranch that is the land base for Sundance today in order to protect the land from development . " I completely freaked out , " he recalls , when big developers came sniffing around the canyon for tracts of subdividable land in the late ' ' 60s . But then look what this infatuation with skiing has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ski resort at Sundance , right in his own front yard . When Robert Redford wakes up in his Sundance home , he looks out on one of Utah 's prettiest tracts  --  the hills and dales stacked up against the 12,000-foot bulk of Mount Timpanogos  --  only to see it cluttered up by a ski area that is basically his doing . A rinky-dink ski area called Timphaven had come with the former sheep ranch he had bought , and he could have just abandoned it , allowing time and natural processes to erase all vestiges of it . That would have been the environmentally correct thing to do . Instead , Redford breached environmental etiquette and created a much larger ski area , mainly because he just could n't rid himself of a fanciful urge to be whizzing downhill when the moment 's right , when the sun 's bright , and when the snow 's lighter than one 's own breath . " I 've struggled with this a long time , " he said resignedly , in the amber light in the cabin . " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love to ski . At one point I finally said , " Okay , why do n't you just live with the fact that you 're a hypocrite ? ' ' " Well maybe he is . But the man that everybody at Sundance refers to simply as Bob strives to atone for his hypocrisy by trying to keep the area 's environmental impacts to a minimum . The result : As a ski resort , Sundance is unusually , sometimes counterproductively , understated . Resisting any hint of commercial clutter , Redford for a long time would n't allow any signs  --  e.g. , WELCOME TO SUNDANCE  --  out front . ( There are signs now  --  if you look carefully for them . ) The parking lot remains puny . The 39 cottages that are Sundance 's principal lodging are so enshrouded by woods that you 'd hardly know they were there . Not surprisingly , understated Sundance has remained largely underdiscovered . Up in Salt Lake City , about an hour 's drive away , a lot of skiers still think of Sundance as it was in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alongside nearby giants like Alta , Snowbird , and Park City . But on your average day at Sundance , you get 2,150 vertical feet of interconnected bowls , ridges , and groves pretty much to yourself . If great skiing , few lift lines , and environmentally sensitive understatement are a hypocrite 's idea of a ski area , then I say : God bless hypocrisy . On my first night at Sundance , it rained hard , complete with thunder and lightning . The bowls became huge bathtubs filled with rainwater , and the trails turned to cataracts . Robert Redford oversees almost everything at Sundance ; he has his eye on the positioning of every lift tower and of every kachina doll in The Tree Room restaurant . Sundance is the Land of Bob . Unfortunately , even in the Land of Bob , Bob himself ca n't stop the rain . That 's why , on the day after that stormy night last March , I found myself at Snowbird , an hour 's drive away and untouched by rain , while Sundance was a soggy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wasatch Mountain canyons , which contain , north to south , Snowbasin , Park City , Brighton , Solitude , Alta , Snowbird , and Sundance . Storms behave erratically . Sundance can squeeze three feet of snow from a storm that barely spits on Park City , but unfortunately , as in this instance , Sundance might sop up two inches of rainwater while the other canyons remain snowdusted or bone-dry . The Wasatch canyons also have a special relationship with snow that can tide them through the worst of times . The snow might rot or ice up , but it never seems to stay rotten or icy for long . On the morning after the cloudburst , you could almost hear the rainwater working its way out of the Sundance snow , evaporating , gurgling , and percolating through a complex circulatory system within the snowpack . When the ski area reopened two days after the rain , the snow was crunchy but skiable . And that same day it began snowing again , through a succession of cumulus puffs that would get trapped by the canyon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days after the rain I was eight inches deep along the edges of Amy 's Ridge , following the tracks of Jerry Warren , the director of skiing at Sundance . Consider it another day in the skiing life of Utah . Or consider it a tall tale , which I think is how people at Creekside , the base-area cafeteria , viewed it when Jerry and I showed up for lunch with our deep-powder reports . We told them of the feather-weight lightness of the new snow in the aspens alongside Jamie 's , an intermediate mogul run on the top third of the mountain . In Bishop 's Bowl , depending on which exposure you skied , you could be up to your boot tops in snow or absolutely flying on a thin powder layer on top of the rain-consolidated crust . It had been snowing fairly hard most of the morning , we told them at Creekside . But since it had n't been snowing at the base , they looked at us as if to say : Right . And fish fly . The configuration of Sundance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in regard to weather . The ski area consists of a front mountain , with mostly lower-intermediate skiing , and a back mountain , where most of Sundance 's best skiing is . At the base at the bottom of the front mountain , you have little sense that a second mountain is there at all , which is one reason , I 'm sure , that a lot of Salt Lakers still think of Sundance as pitch-and-putt and which is also why the people at Creekside had a hard time believing that it could be snowing back there while they were basking in the sun . No need to go on at length about the front mountain . It 's easy , wide-open skiing with a few steep pitches toward the top . It 's the sort of terrain to keep families with young kids content . But this is not the skiing for which you would make a special trip to Sundance , and it might not be around long anyway . When a proposed new access lift to the back mountain is put in , it 's Redford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revert to a natural state . Another of Sundance 's understatements is its trail map , a valiant effort to diagram that which is pretty much undiagrammable . The basics , I suppose , are simple enough . There are just two chair lifts , both triples , on that back mountain , Arrowhead and Flathead . As you ride Arrowhead along Amy 's Ridge toward the summit , you can take a quick inventory of the layout : To the right , tree-lined trails feed into Bearclaw , the wide , intermediate main drag ; to the left is the expansive arc of Bishop 's Bowl . From Bishop 's Bowl or from Amy 's Ridge , you can link up with the generally steep series of small bowls and chute-like trails that comprise the principal Flathead terrain . What complicates this apparent simplicity is all that is left out : A good deal of what is skiable at Sundance is n't even indicated on the map . For every trail on the map ( and I use the term " trail " loosely here , seeing as all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , there are several unmarked nooks and mini-bowls , gullies and slots through the trees . Despite having a vertical rise that is greater than Alta 's , Sundance lacks long , sustained , leg-burning runs ; it is instead an assembly of many smaller pieces . As such , it 's best to explore  --  almost to browse , really , as you might browse around in a bookstore or flea market , where the obvious is jumbled together with the obscure . So after leaving the Creekside skeptics , Jerry and I went browsing , our particular mission that afternoon being to find out just how the paradoxical convergence of storm and sunshine had distributed its effect across the mountainside . The higher we went , the better and deeper the snow . We found fine , deep powder in Snow Stake , the steep mini-bowl that opens up from a subtle gap in the trees about halfway down Bearclaw . The weather had treated Grizzly Bowl , the steep funnel leading to the Flathead base , less generously , apparently because of a slightly lower elevation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a skiing surface that felt in the knees and lower back like a combination of cobblestones and broken oyster shells . But back higher on the mountain , on the north-facing slope that falls away into Bishop 's Bowl , we found fabulous powder , light and fresh , as we poked around through the widely spaced trees . I suppose this is what browsing is all about : You might find junk or you might find a gem , but half the fun is in the search . Bob  --  let 's be like everyone else at Sundance and call him that , whaddya say ?  --  takes a look around at some other ski resorts and talks about " your senses being assaulted with mechanization : gondolas , cables , sounds of churning machinery . Pretty soon , you feel like you 're on the inside of a big , huge watch . " So he has developed Sundance as something of an antidote , " more of a retreat , more of a place off the beaten track . " Another way of putting this is that Sundance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whirring machinery that is used to carry Sundance skiers upward shuts down at 4 P.M. , the hills are alive with the sound of ... well , almost nothing . There are no apres-ski clubs , no beer bashes , no dance bands on the sun deck . Instead , there are two restaurants , two small shops , and 39 guest cottages ( at last count ) of varying sizes stuck away behind the forest camouflage . Buildings that house screening and meeting facilities stand largely dormant in winter , waiting for the summer and fall when the Sundance Institute holds its eight-week retreats for playwrights and screenwriters . All of it is touched , in subtle or overt ways , by Bob 's ideas about low-impact , environmentally compatible development  --  lots of wood walls and , in some cases , even sod roofs . This is not to say that Sundance lacks elegance  --  behind those wood walls , things are pretty fancy , pretty spiffy  --  or that more development ( e.g. , 22 more cottages for next season ) is out of the question . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hang in the balance . So when evening comes to Bob 's low-impact retreat , the world of Sundance seems to close in on itself . After skiing , you go back to your cottage , you shower , you rest , and then you eat . It 's the rudimentary activity of being at home  --  which is pretty much what Bob had in mind , seeing as Sundance is his home . Let me linger just a moment on the matter of eating , the nocturnal highlight of Sundance . The Tree Room is the more elegant of the two restaurants ( The Grill Room next door is the other ) , and with the upholstered seating , the Native American blankets on the wall , and the snow-laden tree branches that are canopies over the windows , the restaurant seems to suck away sound and harshness . The food is quite remarkable : One evening I had Alaskan halibut , but somewhere on the way from Alaska through the kitchen it had metamorphosed into something the texture of softened butter . When the citizens of Provo , 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is the place they come . Beyond that , Sundance night life is of the sort that I suspect would bore high-energy apres-skiers to dizziness within a matter of hours . It consists of little more than conversation and the soporific pleasure of watching sap boil from green aspen logs , burning in the stone fireplaces that are a Sundance ubiquity . When you tire of that , you can pop your head outside and stare at the shadow of Mount Timpanogos or the flush of stars against a blue-black sky . As I discovered in trying to stumble and paw my way back to my cottage each evening after dinner , Bob is n't fond of mucking up the night with lots of outdoor lighting . Invited my brother , who lives in Salt Lake City , to join me for a day of skiing . Like many other Salt Lakers , he had never been convinced that Sundance was big enough , or good enough , to justify the 55-minute drive when Alta or Snowbird were only about a half hour away . We spent most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bearclaw . Some of it , like Hill 's Headwall and Freddie 's , was marked on the map ; much of it was not . In the open aspens of Hill 's , we found light , deep powder ; with so few skiers , the powder can remain unskied for days in the less-browsed places of Sundance . Later , lunching in the sun outside the mountaintop cabin and looking 4,000 feet straight down into the bottleneck of Provo Canyon , we shared sandwiches with Caesar , the thick-coated , wobbly-legged old avalanche dog . Turns out Caesar is a dog of discriminating tastes ; he prefers his sandwiches on wholewheat , rather than sourdough . In the afternoon , we headed for the south-facing side of Bishop 's , where the sun had turned what once had been powder into porridge . We skied it fast , skimming through the thick , consistent snow , around and over the scrub pines sticking up through the snow surface . In short , a day of skiing as skiing was meant to be . The day after my brother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Suzanne . Suzanne and I were on one of those powder searches that take skiers to places they might not ordinarily go  --  in this case , into a thick-trunked stand of evergreens between Amy 's Ridge and Bearclaw . We found snow all right , but we came across something else , too  --  a large snowshoe hare , frozen in fear of the powder-searchers who had suddenly crashed his private party . The encounter was brief , neat , and unexpected , yet one that also struck me as utterly appropriate for the low-key deep-woods world of Sundance . Then , a moment later , we were off , as was the hare , each of us in our own way browsing in the Land of Bob . <p>
