After finishing a major story on the gay-rights movement two weeks ago , TIME senior writer William A. Henry III confessed to his editor that he was a bit worn down . He was walking with difficulty and , as he said , " feeling very mortal . " It was a tragically prophetic remark . Last week , while in England to cover the London theater for us , Bill died of a massive heart attack . He was 44 . <P> Those of us who were his colleagues and friends ( and one was virtually synonymous with the other ) are just beginning to realize the extent of our loss . Bill did an extraordinary number of things extraordinarily well . He was TIME 's drama critic , but while vigorously filling that post , he also wrote extensively about politics , social issues , the media , books ( especially the mysteries he devoured ) and the handful of nonteam sports of which he was an armchair savant  --  tennis , in particular . Between stories he appeared frequently on TV panels  --  you name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but well-thought-out opinions  --  he lectured , wrote books and free-lanced for other publications . After all that , he still had time for his amazingly wide and varied circles of friends  --  people at every level of our company , journalists , theater folk , New Jersey neighbors , Yale classmates . <P> Part of Bill 's secret was that he rarely did fewer than two things at once . In meetings he opened his mail while discoursing on story ideas . When he went to lunch with a co-worker , he often took a book , so as to utilize any precious moments when his companion might be away from the table . Magnificently rumpled , intensely convivial though a teetotaler , flamboyant ( " He always spoke ex cathedra , " says a senior editor ) , Bill was a vivid personality in an era when journalists tend to be a bland , earnest bunch . Everything he did was distinguished by a first-class intellect , which showed in his polished prose , his ability to organize complex material , and his ceaseless flow of ideas . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pulitzer Prizes , a bracing professionalism . He never turned down an assignment , and he attacked even the most mundane task as if another Pulitzer depended on it . <P> Bill 's final book is In Defense of Elitism , which will be published in September . In it he insists on " the simple fact that some people are better than others  --  smarter , harder working , more learned , more productive , harder to replace . " Bill was pre-eminently one of those people , but with a crucial difference : he will be impossible to replace .
