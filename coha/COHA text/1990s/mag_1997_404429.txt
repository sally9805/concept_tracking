there was this hill right in front of our place , and my oldest daughter , Michelle  --  she was about three  --  managed to undo the front gate and get out . I looked out the window and she was in the middle of the street , and just then this car came over the hill . So I went tearing out  --  I think I went through the screen door  --  and I ran out and grabbed her , and the car swerved , and I spanked her . I said , " Do n't you ever go out there again ! ' Whack ! " The moving car , the oblivious child , the terrified parent ... the spanking . This particular memory belongs to Hugh MacMillan , the father of two school-aged girls  --  but what parent does n't recognize the scenario ? It 's such a familiar story that it 's almost part of our collective experience . But for how long ? Around the globe , corporal punishment has been put on the agenda as a human rights issue for children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishment , five other countries have followed suit . Corporal punishment in schools has been banned through most of Western Europe , and in many other countries as diverse as China , Jordan and Ecuador . In North America , the vast majority of high-profile child-rearing experts and parent educators advise against spanking . The Canadian Paediatric Society and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend alternatives to physical punishment . They wo n't get any arguments from MacMillan . He has already given up spanking , partly because of how this particular story ended : " Later inside , after everything was calmer , I said , " Now , why should you not go out the gate ? ' And Michelle answered : " Cause you 'll get angry . " So what happened there was , first of all , I was scared out of my mind , then I was relieved , and then I felt love towards my kid and stuff like that  --  I had this whole range of emotions in about 3 1/2 seconds , and all she got was the anger : Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , " Oh , man , this is really the wrong message . ' ' " MacMillan is not the only Canadian parent who questions the merits of spanking . Joan Durrant , a clinical child psychologist and associate professor at the University of Manitoba , has studied Canadian parents ' practices and attitudes towards corporal punishment . Although her results show that a majority of Canadian parents do spank their children , Durrant also points to evidence that public opinion is shifting away from corporal punishment . " In randomly drawn samples in Toronto , St. Catharines Ontario , and Winnipeg , we got the same range : 70 to 75 percent of parents have spanked their children , " reports Durrant . " But this number includes any hitting at all , ever , not just parents who intentionally spank as a discipline method . " With this definition , the mother who does n't believe in spanking , and who has never struck any of her three children  --  except for that one time when Timmy spit in her face and she slapped without even thinking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " To call parents like her " spankers " is rather like calling the couch potato who once ran around the block " a jogger . " Unfortunately , the available research does not tell us how many parents fall into this category . So although we do know that about one-quarter of Canadian parents never spank , we do n't really know how often the rest of us actually hit our kids . What Durrant 's research did find , though , is that most of us do n't feel too great about the spanking we do . Nearly all of the parents  --  between 85 and 95 percent  --  in Durrant 's samples said they felt guilty after spanking . Only about 20 percent reported that they believe obedience , learning of acceptable behaviour , and increased respect for the parent are frequent results of physical punishment . Forty-six percent believe that spanking leads to increased aggression in children . It 's a safe bet that few of our own parents would have felt so ambivalent about the value of " a good spanking . " But nobody could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a belief in spanking as an effective way to deliver a strong message . Even parents who hardly ever spank will react against the thought of chucking it out altogether , of never again even saying : " You 'll get a spanking if you do n't stop ! " Okey Chigbo , the father of two young boys , spanks far less than his own parents did . " I grew up in Nigeria , and the whole community had a sterner and more inflexible approach to discipline than I want to take with my kids . There was a lot of smacking and corporal punishment there , including , for very serious offences , using a cane or a switch . But this is a different world . Those methods just are n't going to work here . " Instead , Chigbo relies on a variety of discipline approaches , from short timeouts to physically enforcing a rule ( e.g. , carrying his balky son up to the bath ) to counting ( " I do n't know why that works but it often does " ) . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he also spanks . " When used sparingly , I believe it 's useful . It 's for when there 's no room to mess around , when you need immediate , decisive action . For example , one day I looked up and my five-year-old was carrying his baby brother upside-down , with the baby 's head bent at a kind of unnatural angle . I yelled at him to stop but he ignored me  --  so I dashed across the room , rescued the baby , and gave my older son a sharp smack on the bottom . It 's a situation where you want to make a very definite point : " This must not happen again . ' ' " Many parents would agree that when " physical safety is threatened , spanking is justified . I on ? spank in a life-threatening situation , ' says one mother of three boys . " If words have n't worked , I 'll give them a smack on the bum , through their clothing . It does n't cause a lot of pain ; it 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is really , really important . ' A spank , to me , is better than being hit by a car . " Of course it is . But do we really need to hit children to keep them safe ? Sweden , a country that has made huge strides towards becoming a non-spanking society , also has impressively low paediatric accident rates . Instead of punishing children for following their natural need to explore the world , the Swedes have concentrated on making the world safer for kids , observes Durrant , who spent six months in Sweden studying the effects of their " no spanking " law . You ca n't buy a stove there that is n't equipped with a guard around the elements . It s such a different attitude . You just protect them until they 're old enough to understand . " For some parents , that seems like a long wait . They argue that spanking helps toddlers , who are too young to respond to reasoning , learn the rules . " Our two-year-old does n't understand what a bad burn is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from the stove to avoid that little slap on the hand . " Or will she ? " The thing is , " says Durrant , " that no matter what you do , toddlers ca n't be depended on to always follow the rules . They are too immature . " So whether or not you spank a toddler for touching the stove , you must still continue to supervise her closely in the kitchen . She ca n't keep herself safe . In any case , most spankings are not about danger . Durrant points out that young children frequently get spanked for behaviours that go hand-in-hand with normal development : separation anxiety ( whining , clinging ) , exploration ( " getting into things " ) , defiance , picky eating , toilet-training difficulties . Two-year-olds , with their high drive to explore , low impulse control , and intense emotions , get spanked a lot . Often , it 's parental anger and frustration with these normal , but difficult , behaviours that trigger the spanking . Spanking in Anger Many parents are shocked at how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Landy , a child psychologist with Toronto 's Hincks Institute . Because children lack adult capacities , they can drive you crazy , especially if you expect more mature behaviour . People often do n't realize , for example , how much repetition it takes for young children to learn . " Kathleen Curry , a mother of two preschoolers , is well acquainted with the anger that can lead to spanking : We do n't spank our kids , but I have been so tempted on some occasions , and I do n't know where that comes from , whether that s because that 's how I saw my mother and father deal with situations where they were pushed to their limits . For me it seems instinctual . I have a quick temper and I think that 's one of my fears , one of the reasons I do n't spank . But I have found myself thinking , " I 'd like nothing more right now than to spank you . That would take care of this problem . ' And then I have to take a step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself why we decided against spanking . And I 've always found when I did that , I 've managed to take a deep breath , and to find another way to deal with the situation . " Ron Cambridge works with children who are in treatment with Kinark Child and Family Services in Peterborough , Ontario . Part of his job is to help parents learn new skills to deal constructively with their very challenging kids . He observes that spanking is often a response to stress : " It 's so easy for the buildup of tension and frustration to be taken out on the children . But that anxiety and anger is mine , not my child 's . So the question is , how am I going to deal with it , rather than direct it against the kid ? " I 've spanked on a number of occasions , but only once out of anger and with intent of pain , " recalls Sylvia Arsenault . " My youngest one was an infant , and we had had a long , exhausting drive to Montreal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put him to bed . And my older son , who was just under three , woke up the baby . And I remember walking in that room thinking , " I 'm going to spank him until it hurts . ' And it was the most nauseating , horrible , disgusting feeling .... I have never , never done that since . I have been angry to that point , but now I say : " More is so angry , I need a time out ! ' ' " Why the concern ? Certainly , one reason professionals give for avoiding spanking is that it can get out of control and cause unintended harm ( see " Spanking &; Abuse : What 's the Connection ? " p. 46 ) . But there are other concerns , as well : Spanking does not teach the values and skills we want children to learn . Parents are powerful role models , and children learn from what we do as much as from what we say . As Cambridge asks , " What are kids learning from us when we spank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to handle conflict ? About how to establish relationships with other people ? " Adds Durrant , " Kids do have to learn that in the real world , there are consequences to bad behaviour . But the consequence will not be being hit ! If we want them to learn about real consequences , we should be teaching them about taking responsibility , making amends , understanding , apologizing .... " Spanking is linked to aggressive behaviour in children . We know that aggressive , defiant children get spanked more often . Since it makes sense that more " difficult " kids would provoke more spankings , the effect of the spanking itself has been difficult to establish . But Durrant explains that more recent research is showing that " corporal punishment does n't decrease and , in fact , exacerbates aggressive behaviour . One way we 've been able to demonstrate that is with treatment studies . They take parents of aggressive kids who are already doing a lot of spanking , and they have half of them stop  --  and in that group they have been able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Landy leads parenting courses for parents whose children are " non-compliant and aggressive . " Landy says that most of the parents she works with " recognize that spanking has not been helpful with their child . Almost without exception , they are ready to find new ways of handling misbehaviour . " Usually , too , they report significant improvement when they replace spanking with other discipline methods . Spanking tends to divert the child 's attention away from the original issue ( his own behaviour ) because it provokes such strong emotions  --  fear , resentment , hostility . How does it feel to be spanked ? It 's a question that 's often left our of discussions of corporal punishment  --  maybe because we do n't much like to think about it . But Landy asks parents at her courses to share their own memories of being spanked , because that 's the first step to understanding how children respond . I remember feeling completely nauseous , " says parent Kathleen Curry . " My mother would take us by the hand and march us up to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undressing , then the lean over the lap , whack , whack , whack , however many times  --  and the anticipation , the process of getting to the point of the spanking was just so agonizing . " You did everything you could do to block out the physical and the emotional pain , " recalls Hugh MacMillan . " ' Why would this guy who 's supposed to care about me be doing this to me right now . That 's one thing I remember , you know , trying to block that thought out . " So a lot of a child 's energy is going into coping with the spanking itself , and the intensely unpleasant feelings that follow . How much will be left for thinking about the transgression that started it all ? The way kids " interpret " spanking partly explains the discrepancy between many parents ' perceptions that spanking " works , " and behavioural research that suggests it is less  --  not more  --  effective than less punitive discipline methods in the long term . In the short term , says Durrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behaviour if he can , in order to avoid pain . But , like young Michelle MacMillan , who saw her dad 's anger  --  rather than the traffic  --  as the danger to be avoided , children who are spanked may simply focus on not getting caught , rather than gradually developing their own inner controls . Spanking loses its effectiveness over time . " With repeated occurrences , " notes Durrant , " the child starts to habituate to the spanking . The child will build up a tolerance , parents have to spank harder to get the same response  --  an ugly cycle begins . " Sylvia Arsenault remembers , as a teenager , babysitting some children who had been hit frequently . " I was having a problem with one of the boys , and I remember him looking up to me and saying , " You can not hurt me enough to make me cry . ' And he had this look in his eyes , and I realized this was a power struggle I could n't win . " Severe levels of corporal punishment are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as criminal behaviour , family violence , depression and low achievement . This connection was demonstrated in Murray Straus 's National Family Violence Surveys of thousands of Americans , as well as in other studies . The trouble is , no one knows for sure where to draw the line between " normal " spanking and " severe " spanking . Okey Chigbo notes , quite rightly , that what constitutes abuse is a culturally driven concept . Much of the " normal " discipline he observed as a child would be considered abusive in Canada today . " If spanking were really so damaging , practically everyone I grew up with should be a criminal ! " he points out . By the same token , some cultures would find Canadian standards unjustifiably harsh . Hugh MacMillan was stunned to find himself at odds with a whole community because of a seemingly unremarkable interaction with his daughter : " When our kids were pretty young  --  I guess about two and four  --  my wife and I travelled around the world with them . We were staying in this village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle with children . My youngest daughter went running along the beach one day , and I was calling her back and she was n't coming , so I ran after her and grabbed her , yelled at her , marched her back , pulling her along by the arm in that pissed-off-parent way . And I was totally oblivious but I guess the people of the village who witnessed this were so upset by it that the men had a meeting that night to discuss whether we should be kicked out ! And eventually one of them was sent to talk to me . It was a pretty weird conversation ; I taught parenting courses at the time and at first I thought he was there to ask my advice about child-rearing . But it gradually dawned on me that he had something really important to teach me . " Our attitudes and assumptions about child-rearing are so interwoven with our own childhood experiences , culture and the community that surrounds us , that it 's difficult to even see them . Murray Straus , in his book Beating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused pervasive social damage , yet it is so taken for granted that its effects are virtually invisible to most people . Is " normal " spanking really harmful ? We may never know for sure . But perhaps we do n't need to . Although much of the current spanking debate focuses on its behavioural effects , Durrant feels strongly that the moral issue is unavoidable : " I think it 's quite bizarre that we even discuss " Does it work ? " and imply that if it works , then it 's OK . If a husband hits his wife for screwing up the dinner , and the next night she has it ready on time , we do n't say , " Well , we 've got to give him that right . It works for him . ' We say , " I do n't care if it worked  --  it 's wrong . ' With this emphasis on whether spanking works , we forget what we 're doing . What we 're doing is hitting another person . If you believe that it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parent , you have to question your right to hit your child . " Resources There are many excellent books offering positive alternatives to spanking .

Straus , Lexington Books ( Cdn. distributor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the Connection ? Parents who occasionally spank understandably object to having their discipline approach equated in any way with child abuse . There is , after all , a world of difference between slapping a child 's hand and injuring her  --  just as there is a world of difference between life in a warm , loving family where spankings are saved for the worst transgressions , and life in the nightmare world of an abusive family . And yet , a research review on corporal punishment , co-authored by psychologist Joan Durrant for Health Canada , suggests there is a connection , at both the personal and the societal level . Sociologically , public attitudes towards corporal punishment do influence the rate of child abuse : The more acceptance and approval there is of spanking in a culture , the more frequently children are spanked and the more frequently they are physically abused . There 's a kind of spillover effect  --  normalization of " everyday " spanking raises the overall threshold and tolerance for violence , and increases the likelihood of more severe assaults in at-risk families . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a high-stakes game . When you hit a child , you raise the risk of eventually hurting him . " As child treatment worker Ron Cambridge says , " I think , at least I hope , that nobody goes in with the intention of hurting their kids . It may be stress or anger that pushes them over the line the first time , so that they hit too hard or do n't stop when they should . But when it happens , it tends to escalate . " If you feel you may be at risk of abusing your child , please get help . See your family doctor and ask for a referral for counselling . In a crisis , call a local help line or child protection agency . Stopping the Hitting Why do some parents decide not to spank ? Some never really think much about it  --  it 's just not their style . But , says psychologist Sarah Landy of the Hincks Institute , since " it 's almost a natural reflex to parent as you were parented , " for most parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thought " to stop spanking . We invited four parents with varying backgrounds to a round-table discussion on spanking . Interestingly , all the participants had come to feel that corporal punishment was not for them . Here , they talk about how they gave it up : Sylvia : My partner and I decided before we had kids that we were n't going to spank , but we did . Looking back , we did it on a more regular basis than we ever realized , until one day my son brought it to my attention that we were spanking even though we said we were n't  --  sort of like saying " 1 do n't swear " until you hear yourself on tape , and you realize how often you do swear . But I never felt there was anything beneficial that came out of it . I decided about a year ago not to spank anymore . Hugh : I think I just could n't get away with it anymore . I mean , I 'm trying to raise my girls to be independent and assertive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found out early on that I ca n't do that and then pull rank and run right over them at home . Kathleen : Before we had children , my husband and I were really clear that we wanted a no-hitting household for a number of reasons . One of the reasons is that it 's an issue for my husband , who was beaten quite regularly by an abusive alcoholic parent . That was something we did n't want to relive in any way . And I think the bottom line for me was that I did n't want to inflict pain on my children . So we made the decision that we would look for alternatives in discipline to spanking . Now that said , there have been a few occasions when I have transgressed that , and I have struck one of my children in a moment of incredible frustration . Elke : When they were younger preschoolers , I did spank my kids . But there came a point with my oldest where I realized I had to stop , and deal with him in a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's aggressive with other kids  --  and now I wonder whether it 's because I spanked him more as a child , because I was more severe with him than I was with the other two , that he is now more aggressive and difficult ? I do n't know . But the spanking , it 's just showing him the wrong thing , that violence is OK and if you can hit someone that shows you 're the boss . And to me spanking is violence , let 's face it . You can be doing it hard or very lightly , but either way , it 's a show of violence . So I stopped , because I saw it was n't solving the problem . It was doing the opposite from what I wanted  --  so I said , " No more , this is wrong . " <p>
