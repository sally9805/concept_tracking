<p> It 's no surprise that there are some sour grapes around the league over the Cleveland situation . The league is setting a bad precedent by kicking in a loan for as much as $ 48 million to help Cleveland build a new stadium to replace the Browns , who won approval to move to Baltimore even though they did not meet such league guidelines as level of fan support , extent of community efforts to keep the franchise and the market 's profitability . <p> The Rams ' move to St. Louis was not approved at last March 's meetings because they did not meet the guidelines . They were going to file a lawsuit and move anyway , but the owners gave their approval one month later . <p> " " There 's no question that the commissioner never addressed the guidelines - as to whether Art Modell passed the guidelines , " Raiders owner Al Davis said . " " He never did . I tried to pin him down because when the Rams moved , they said that the Rams did not meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's discriminatory and selective as to who gets what - and who gets what they want - when it comes to doing things in our league . " <p> About the guidelines , commissioner Paul Tagliabue said , " " Cleveland met some , but not all . And then there were other aspects of the guidelines that we felt we did not have to reach a final decision on in view of the settlement he had achieved . I think everyone - Baltimore , Cleveland - felt that was the appropriate way to proceed . " <p> Bengals owner Mike Brown , who has the lowest stadium revenue in the league , put it this way : " " This is a case of the squeaky wheel getting the grease . " Part of Cleveland 's deal stipulates that personal seat license ( PSL ) money will be used to build the stadium , not line an owner 's pockets . There will be no PSL higher than $ 2,500 , and none will be sold in the 10,000-seat Dawg Pound . A maximum of $ 35 million in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NFL 's contribution toward construction . Any PSL proceeds over $ 35 million must be applied to reduce the city 's contribution to construction . Long-time Browns season-ticket holders will get price breaks on PSLs based on years of holding season tickets . <p> Mayor Michael White is exploring the possibility of building a domed stadium tied into a convention center that would cost more than the $ 240 million earmarked for a 72,000-seat outdoor stadium . White must inform the NFL by March 24 if the stadium is going to be open-air or domed . <p> White , who could end up being governor of Ohio after the way he has performed under the most difficult of circumstances , does not want the Bengals to be the team because he does n't want to steal another city 's franchise , especially one from his home state . If Cincinnati does n't approve the 1/2-cent tax referendum March 19 to build a new stadium , the Bengals will try to move to Cleveland . <p> White is concerned about Cleveland getting another owner it considers to be one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " " Are there some owners I would not prefer ? " White said . <p> " " Absolutely . I want us to get a good owner who understands this community , one that is not an absentee owner . I want an owner that will help the quality of life in the community . If I could clone or make a Xerox of Dan Rooney ( Pittsburgh ) , he would be a Cleveland owner . " <p> Around the league <p> Krieg could be cut <p> If the Oilers grant quarterback Chris Chandler 's request to be traded , as expected , they might be able to replace him with Dave Krieg . Last year , Chandler and Krieg were the two quarterbacks the Oilers pursued . Chandler was at the top of the list , and when he signed , Krieg signed with Arizona . <p> New Cardinals coach Vince Tobin is not interested in having Krieg , who turns 38 this year , as his starting quarterback . If Arizona gets the quarterback it wants , Krieg will be waived . <p> Because Tobin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't be surprised if they sign Jeff Hostetler . Not only did Fassel coach Hostetler with the Raiders , but he also coached him with the Giants . <p> Robinson in demand <p> The Carolina Panthers are one of numerous teams interested in Oilers outside linebacker Eddie Robinson . The Panthers unloaded some contracts and restructured others , and they have at least $ 12 million available under the salary cap . Last year , remember , they signed Oilers outside linebacker Lamar Lathon to a deal worth almost $ 13 million , so do n't be surprised if they come after Robinson in a hurry with a monster offer . <p> Scouts get religion <p> At the Indianapolis scouting combine last week , New York Giants general manager George Young got tired of hearing Nebraska quarterback Tommie Frazier being compared to Pittsburgh quarterback Kordell Stewart , who also plays running back and receiver . <p> " " All of the people investigating the players have one single religion : Hindu , " Young said . " " We always think somebody 's the reincarnation of somebody else who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carolina strong safety Bubba McDowell , the former Oiler who still lives in Houston in the offseason , restructured his contract to help clear up about $ 500,000 under the salary cap . <p> He was told he would compete with Brett Maxie and Pat Terrell for the starting job that he lost last season when he was still not 100 percent recovered from a knee injury he suffered with the Oilers . <p> " " I think the offer was reasonable considering the fact that they were the only people really willing to give me a chance to come back last year , " McDowell says . " " They took their risk in me . I felt somewhat obligated to come back . Hopefully , I can compete for a starting job and get back to being the old Bubba , the hard-hitting guy I was with the Oilers . " <p> Tobin no back stabber <p> If Vince Tobin had stayed as the Colts ' defensive coordinator , he would have had a chance to replace Ted Marchibroda as head coach . But Tobin has been in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accused of stabbing Marchibroda in the back with his brother , director of football operations Bill Tobin , who made the move . <p> " " All you have to have is one guy make a statement , " Vince Tobin says about any back-stabbing charges . " " Once you get that perception , it 's with you forever . " All 's well that ends well . Offensive coordinator Lindy Infante replaced Marchibroda , who was hired by Art Modell to be Baltimore 's new coach . <p> Frerotte could stay <p> Word out of Baltimore is that the Redskins might not trade quarterback Gus Frerotte , but that could be just a ploy to try to get more for him . Insiders say coach Norv Turner is committed to Heath Shuler but is concerned about the former No. 1 pick 's ability to stay healthy . <p> The best-case scenario would be to trade Frerotte for draft choices and sign a veteran to play behind Shuler , who will never feel comfortable as long as he is threatened by a player who is more popular with the fans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping Frerotte another year . He will become a restricted free agent after next season , and if a team signs him , they will get a No. 1 pick as compensation . <p> Right now , he is n't worth a No.1 draft choice . <p> High opinion of himself <p> Last year , there was a lot of speculation that Illinois junior linebacker Simeon Rice would be the No. 1 pick in the draft if he came out a year early . His stock dropped as a senior because , some scouts say , he just went through the motions . <p> Now , he is considered as no better than the third-best pass rusher in the draft behind Oklahoma 's Cedric Jones and Texas ' Tony Brackens . <p> Rice does not lack confidence . " " I see myself going No. 1 , " Rice says . " " I know I would select me if I had the No. 1 pick . " <p> Fryar wants to go home <p> Miami receiver Irving Fryar , who fell out of favor with the Dolphins last season and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his career with the Patriots , who selected him with the first pick in the draft in 1984 . <p> " " Coming back to the Patriots would be good because it would allow me to come full circle and play again where my career started , " Fryar says . " " People think there were problems between Bill ( Parcells ) and me when I left , but that was n't true . We left on very good terms . Believe me , the two of us could work well together . <p> " " Trading me was my idea . I wanted to get a new contract . Bill would n't do it . He said he wanted to wait until the next year . <p> At that point I wanted out , and I asked him to trade me . He told me that if I could get a team to give the Patriots a second- and a third-round draft pick for me that he 'd go along with it . Miami was willing to do it , and the trade was made . <p> Bill was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need receivers for quarterback Drew Bledsoe . <p> Even though Fryar is 33 , he still has speed and would give them a dangerous threat . <p> St.Louis pays the price <p> The sale of personal seat licenses in St. Louis not only helped the Rams move , but now it is helping other clubs . The Rams are providing 54 percent of the funding for the league 's new revenue-sharing plan . That comes to $ 35 million of the $ 64.7-million pool that the league wants to raise through the 1998 season . Almost $ 25 million of the Rams ' contribution comes from PSLs . The Rams are one of six teams contributing out of their revenue on club seats . Miami and Atlanta , the other teams that sell club seats , are not contributing because they use that money for stadium construction . <p> NFL not super in Frisco <p> The 1999 Super Bowl will not be played in San Francisco , but that probably wo n't be official until the March meetings . The NFL awarded the game to Candlestick Park if the city provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jordan won the bid , and new mayor Willie Brown refuses because the money is n't available . The 49ers are no longer interested because they do n't want $ 30 million spent on Candlestick Park at a time when they are intensifying efforts to get a new stadium . <p> Odds and ends <p> The Jacksonville Jaguars , last in the NFL with just 17 sacks last year , took a big step toward improving their pass rush by signing Bears defensive end Alonzo Spellman to an offer sheet Saturday . The Bears designated Spellman as a transition player Friday , meaning they have seven days to match the offer . <p> Spellman , a first-round pick by the Bears in 1992 , had seven sacks in 1994 , and followed it up with 81/2sacks last year . . . <p> Former Oilers offensive tackle David Williams was unable to sign with one of the three teams in his home state of Florida , so he took the best deal on the table . The New York Jets , who had the worst record in the league last season , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million signing bonus and an average salary of $ 2.4 million a year . . . <p> Miami linebacker Bryan Cox is going to get a lot of interest on the open market . Because the Dolphins are having problems with the cap , it is doubtful he will return , although he told them he would give them a chance to match any offer . Cox 's price is a $ 3 million average over four or five years . Green Bay , Chicago , Denver and San Diego are showing the most interest . <p> Bye-bye Billy <p> Miami and New England were involved in a heated tug-of-war to hire Bill Belichick as defensive coordinator , with the Patriots finally winning the battle Friday . In his five seasons in Cleveland , Belichick was 37-45 for a winning percentage of .451 . His record against Cincinnati was 8-2 , but he was 29-43 against everyone else . His winning percentage was the second-worst of all Cleveland coaches , better only than Forrest Gregg 's .439 ( 18-23 ) . <p> Belichick 's teams had one winning season and reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years left on his contract worth $ 1.7 million . <p> Owner Art Modell hired Ted Marchibroda to replace Belichick . <p> When Marchibroda was hired in 1975 to coach the Baltimore Colts , he hired a 23-year-old gofer who promised to work for nothing . His name was Billy Belichick . <p> NOTES : John McClain covers the Oilers and the NFL for the Chronicle . His NFL Notebook appears on Sundays .
