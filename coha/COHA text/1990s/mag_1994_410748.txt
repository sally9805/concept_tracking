Where the Berlin Wall used to be , there now is a wall of traders and souvenir stalls dealing in instant nostalgia . Chunks of the wall go for international prices , but Lenin pins are sold by the kilo , and even the matrydshkas ( nested hollow dolls )  --  including the new varieties containing a Brezhnev inside a Gorbachev inside a Yeltsin  --  sell pretty cheap . While they wait for jobs ( about one-third of East Germans are unemployed ) and for telephones , transport , and building codes to be upgraded , East Berliners amuse themselves with a rash of new jokes . It is said , for example , that taxi drivers often doubled as stasi ( secret police ) in the bad old days . Even now , they banter , you do n't have to tell a taxi driver in East Berlin where you are going ; he already knows . Elsewhere , however , in the former U.S.S.R. , even in areas like Belarus and the Baltics that had been among the most modern and prosperous , the new order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first indication of this came with trying to get a visa to visit Belarus . Intourist and the ex-Soviet , now Russian , Embassy , which still handles visas for what used to be the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic , shuttled us back and forth across London for a couple of days before they succeeded in convincing us that processing the applications really would take 14 days ( working days , that is , meaning about four hours a day , four days a week ) . Once convinced of their determination to work  --  or not work  --  at that pace , we gave up the effort in London to resume it later in Germany . In Bonn , the operation proved more expeditious , but also more expensive . After we spent almost two days standing in lines and chasing after the appropriate forms and currencies , they managed to produce the actual visa in a couple of hours . Notwithstanding our official invitations to visit as guests of an academic institution , the visas cost us $100 each . Visas finally in hand , we boarded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overnight to Minsk . The express was not simply slow ; it was a voyage backwards in time . Yet , it made up in local color what it lacked in speed and comfort . The only refreshment to be had was Russian tea , prepared in a small ceramic pot and dispensed by the all-purpose attendant . The " babushkas " ( attendants ) appeared to be homesteading in their sleeping cars and to assume a proprietary attitude toward them , particularly the restrooms , which they generally kept locked . Sleep would have been a waste , given the entertainment that filled the wee hours . Shortly after the train crossed from Poland into Belarus , one or two of the cars at a time had to be jacked up to be refitted with wheels that operated on the narrower Russian gauge . The jacks that lifted the cars some six feet off of the rails were hydraulic , but most of the subsequent adjustments , which took more than two hours , were made by male and female grease monkeys who crawled into the pits under the rail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toolboxes . With its broad avenues and leafy parks , Minsk wears a placid face . At the farmers ' co-op market , one can see tired shoppers waiting in long lines to buy eggs at subsidized prices , while the free-marketeers standing nearby offer the same eggs without the wait , but at prices few can afford . We were told that there was a seasonal shortage of sugar , but saw no evidence of panic buying or other manifestations of the trauma of transition reported from Russia . Among former Soviet republics , Belarus has more than its share of productive agriculture and potentially profitable industry . Thus , it also has more than its share of , visiting businessmen , hustlers , and would-be investors , Western and Eastern , though few of them are American . ( Most of the Americans we saw in Minsk were evangelicals who had packed the municipal stadium for a revival meeting . ) The chairman of the political science department at the University of Minsk , who does risk analysis on the side , quipped that U.S. businessmen come , find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese businessmen , on the other hand , come , find that the phones do n't work , and stay to design a new telephone system to solve the problem . The Chinese , in fact , are installing centralized switchboards for ministries , hotels , and other establishments . Another thing Belarus has more than its share of is military divisions . The Soviet front-line forces previously deployed in Poland and East Germany pulled back to where the second line of defense had been established  --  in Belarus  --  and there they remain . With some 250,000 military personnel , a ratio of one soldier for every 43 civilians , according to leaders of the Belarus Peace Committee , Belarus has the largest military concentration of any republic in the new Confederation of Independent States ( CIS ) . For better or worse  --  and civilian analysts and policymakers are ambivalent as to which is the case  --  this massive array of force remains without a mission . There are no " strategic objectives " either for Belarus alone or for the CIS , although CIS troops are intervening in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of Moldova , there seems to be agreement at least on the importance of maintaining access to its cognac . ) What is unmistakably clear to civilian leaders is that maintenance of such a military establishment will be very expensive and that subjecting it to deep budget cuts could be dangerous . Russian leaders indicated recognition of the problem when they came through with a major grant to support the troops in Belarus . BALTIC NATIONALISM Belarus gained independence almost by default , and the Old Guard remains largely in control . With links to and , in some areas , dependence upon Russia still strong , the new patriotism in Belarus lacks the fervor that is apparent in the Baltics . Even among scholars who hail from elsewhere , there are opportunities as well as challenges that come with independence . University professors , for instance , while braced for a cutback in funding ( the system previously was supported by the Soviet central government ) , find new fulfillment in being consulted regularly on proposed legislation , and some are tempted to become candidates for elective office . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dialect related to Russian ) the official language is disconcerting to the approximately 80% who have come of age speaking Russian and are not fluent in Byelorussian . Nor did the issuance of a Byelorussian currency inspire much enthusiasm . Most shun it in favor of real money , by which they mean rubles . Patriotism , or nationalism , in the Baltics is something else entirely , rooted in historic precedent , marked by ethnic differences , and reinforced by several years of sustained resistance . The Baltic states historically have looked west , across the sea , rather than east toward Asia , for trade and cultural relations , The languages of Latvia and Lithuania , although Indo-European , have no counterparts in Europe ; they are traceable directly to Sanskrit . Estonian , of the Fino-Ugrian family , finds close kinship only with Finnish and very distantly with Hungarian . Above all , Baltic nationalism has been honed by resistance and is manifest in anger . Resentment , not simply of the former Soviet government , but of Russians generally , is remarkably widespread ; it reminded me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The transition has brought pockets of lawlessness to virtually all of Eastern Europe 's new states . A common feature seems to be the newly emboldened Mafia . In each of the capitals we visited , we were told to avoid the largest and most modern hotels because they had become the sites of Mafia activity . We were informed , for example , that two people had been shot to death the previous week at the restaurant in the luxurious new Hotel Belarus in Minsk . " In the parking lot ? , " we asked . " No , " our hosts replied , " in the restaurant . " It should be noted , perhaps , that the most sinister by far of the presumed Mafia types we encountered  --  at the major Intourist hotel in Vilnius  --  turned out to be American Harley-Davidson Club bikers participating , along with some rock groups , in a " freedom ride " across former communist states . The more general and more remarkable problem was not of intentional lawlessness , but of confusion about which authorities or institutions should enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Polish border demanded to know how much money we were carrying and in what currencies , but when we asked why he needed to know , that he looked perplexed . shrugged , and walked off in frustration . A Belarussian border guard officiously demanded our visas , but en route to Lithuania there was no check even for train tickets , much less for visas . From Lithuania , we entered Latvia by car . There was no mention of a visa . My passport was stamped only as a special favor , and , as a further gesture of welcome , a guard gave me a bullet from his gun . Crossing into Estonia , though , turned out to be a different matter entirely . My husband was dragged off the train in the middle of the night and forced to buy a visa . In Vilnius , the foreign affairs adviser to the Prime Minister , a Lithuanian-American who just had completed a Masters degree at the Monterey Institute of International Studies in California , confirmed that  --  with a melange of old and new , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions representing both old and new regimes  --  it was very difficult even for those in government to sort out who and what were legitimate . The uneven gains and losses of the transition also contributed to instability . In fact , the nationalist neoliberal government that the adviser served had lost its majority the previous day to a communist-led coalition  --  a response , in part , to the hardships faced by peasants whose collective or cooperative farms were being dissolved so that land might be returned to the private owners from whom it was confiscated almost a half-century ago . Like several other Lithuanians with whom we spoke , the foreign adviser registered her distrust of the intelligence and security agencies . Some reorganization had taken place , but the personnel scarcely was changed . About five different agencies assumed responsibilities with respect to parliamentary and government offices , and newly elected leaders , she indicated , take it for granted that their phones are tapped . If the phone taps worked , they may have been just about the only thing about the telephone system that did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use a kopec coin ( worth about one-tenth of a U.S. cent ) . However , since the ruble has been subject to hyperinflation and the kopec has become worthless for all other purposes , the coin no longer is in circulation . Nevertheless , hotel clerks and other helpful persons direct you to the pay phone ; only when you return to ask for a kopec do they tell you there are n't any . From the hotel room there is no difficulty in getting an outside line  --  that 's the only kind there is . There is no central switchboard , so it takes an outside line just to get the desk . International calls are something else again . On one occasion in Minsk , our host had laid out the itinerary for the day . When I mentioned that I needed to make an international call , he said , " Oh , you want to do that instead . " " What do mean , instead ? . " I asked . He responded that the call might take all day , as international calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five hours ahead ; there was always a queue . For political and economic models as well as financial support , Lithuanian nationalists are looking to Scandinavia , and particularly to Norway . Even so , the loss of the Russian market  --  due primarily to Russia 's economic crisis , rather than political factors  --  has been a terrible setback . The shops we saw in Vilnius and Calnas were stocked well enough , but among the new privately owned ones there was little specialization and prices were arbitrary . ( Soviet champagne , for instance , might cost the equivalent of $2 or $20 , depending on whether the price was cited in local or hard currency . ) Many of them seemed to be peddling whatever Uncle Rimas had in the attic . For public institutions of higher education , the squeeze of the transition was particularly tight . An academic administrator at the University of Calnas told us that he would not be able to support a family on his salary ( about $40 a month ) . After a day at the university , he puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he and his wife share a house with her parents , her brother and sister-in-law , and their three children . Minsk , in times past a mostly wooden city in the path of too many conquerors , reveals little of its rich history , but each of the Baltic capitals has in its heart an old city , dating to the Middle Apes . Old Vilnius exhibits , in particular , the golden age of the Polish-Lithuanian kingdom , while Riga and Tallinn retain their Hanseatic character . Each of these cities manifests the architectural exuberance and quirkiness of the turn-of-the-century Art Nouveaux period . Perhaps it was the sunshine , but Riga seemed particularly resplendent . Beyond the winding , cobbled streets of the old city , the newer city sports self-important boulevards and lush , manicured green parks , generously sprinkled with statuary . We saw more of Riga than we had intended because we spent much of our walk-around time lost ; all street names honoring heroes of the socialist revolution had been changed , but the alterations on maps were not reflected yet on street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of prosperity , but when it came to service , or the lack of it , the old ways usually prevailed . As we had found elsewhere in the New East , dining out was a challenge . Local contacts assured us that the bouncers who guarded the doors of every restaurant merely wanted big tips , but the fervor with which they blocked entrances made it appear they already had been tipped by the service staff inside to keep pesky patrons out . We finally managed to sneak past a bouncer and , to our surprise , were able to get the maitre d ' to seat us . The waiter for our area was indignant with the maitre d ' and with us for violating his open spaces , but finally brought us drinks when a German who seated himself at our table waved hard currency at him . All pleas for menus , however , were in vain , so , after surveying the scene to see what others were eating , my husband finally accosted the waiter , almost threateningly , and demanded " one steak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrees arrived and we asked for salads as well ; the waiter simply scoffed and stalked away to the table where he had spent most of the evening smoking and drinking with friends . Standards of service in Tallinn were not necessarily higher , but if perestroika had yet to make its breakthrough , glasnost was riding high . A guidebook for the city noted that guards at restaurant entrances would demand tips and that items listed on menus were not necessarily available . It also advised against approaching public toilets or friendly girls and against strolling at night with valuables . All that notwithstanding , Tallinn turned out to be my favorite of the Baltic capitals . If they can bounce the bouncers , it should be ripe for a boom in tourism . At least within the maze that is the old city , Tallinn has the ambiance of a small town ( a small town , that is , of the Middle Ages ) . We kept running into the same people , particularly a group of Canadian exchange students and a couple of American businessmen . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction in several of the former Soviet republics , informed us that they had located their headquarters in Estonia because , under Finnish " hegemony , " it had made far greater progress than the others toward the realization of a free market . The fact that they had been offered for their offices the very comfortable premises of what was previously the headquarters of the Communist Party seemed to indicate a remarkable openness on the part of Estonian authorities to foreign investors  --  or an interest in tapping their telephones . The businessmen maintained that the crunch will come for all of the Baltic states when they run out of oil reserves since they lack the foreign exchange to buy more . Another problem for those new states was highlighted by a young German who traveled with us on the hydrofoil from Tallinn to Helsinki . He confided that he was using the easy access between Finland and Estonia to bring precious metals out of Russia . The red tape was exhausting , he conceded , but the enormous profit margins make it worthwhile . Given their almost unquestioning embrace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or newly sovereign states of Eastern Europe seem extraordinarily vulnerable to carpetbaggers . The even greater threat to statehood is that embodied in the ruin that was relatively open and prosperous Yugoslavia . Like that sundered nation , each of the new states has ethnic minorities within it . ETHNIC TENSIONS For Estonia , as for Latvia , the most serious short-term problem is one of national identity and citizenship . The plight of the Russian soldiers still billeted in the country  --  more as exiles than occupiers , deserted by their homeland  --  who had come under attack from Estonian civilians is only the tip of an iceberg that threatens to sink the battered ship of state . Approximately one-third of Estonia 's inhabitants are ethnically Russian . Those who came as bureaucrats well may be able to defend their interests , but most came as factory workers . They constitute an underclass , held in contempt , and now in danger of losing the protection of citizenship . A " grandfather clause " has been devised to exclude residents who arrived after 1939 . More recent arrivals were required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September , 1992 , for delegates to the constitutional assembly . Latvians likewise seem determined to expel , exclude from citizenship , or at least limit political participation by the 40% of the population of Russian descent . Even in Riga , where Russian ethnics account for perhaps 80% there were anti-Russian demonstrations and placards telling Russians to go home . In response to the concerns of ethnic Russians throughout the Baltics , Russian Pres. Boris Yelstin announced a decision to lengthen the timetable for withdrawal of troops . The strengths of anti-Russian feeling evident in each of the Baltic states and the consequent fears and frustrations of ethnic Russians do not bode well for a peaceful transition to fully representative government . Still , ethnic friction in the Baltics , troublesome as it is , is less dramatic than what has transpired elsewhere in the ex-Soviet sphere . Whereas the Third World nationalism of the 1960s was about nation-building  --  from the fragments of sometimes warring tribes and language and religious groups-the Second World nationalism of the 1990s has been about state-wrecking . Moreover , the new nationalism is exclusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cookie cutter , and ethnic minorities that do n't fit are discarded like excess dough . The most popular souvenir of the former Soviet Union  --  the matryoshka , the hollow wooden doll that opens to reveal ever smaller dolls within  --  now seems prophetic . The stripping away of the republics that constituted the Soviet Union may have been only the first step in the dissolution of the Russian empire . In the Russian Republic itself , non-Russian minorities , like the Tartars and the Chechen-Inguish , who constitute almost 20% of the population and occupy nearly half the territory , are demanding states of their own . Meanwhile , ethnically distinct regions of Georgia and Moldova are seeking to secede . Fierce battles continue to rage between Armenia and Azerbaijan . Czechs and Slovaks have opted to go their own way , and there remains no end in sight to the violent breakup of Yugoslavia . If the new republics fail to settle on a formula for peaceful coexistence , no strategy for economic revitalization will have any prospect for success . Moreover , economic uncertainty deepens the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War II , the challenges both of containing Germany and countering hostility toward ethnic Germans were dealt with through graduated steps toward European integration . One might have thought that the relatively prosperous European Community would be the inspiration for a new world order at the turn of the 21st century . Instead , the model appears to be that of highland Papua New Guinea , where every valley has its own semi-autonomous wontok ( one talk , or language group ) . Even born-again Germany is suffering from post-partum depression . Unemployed and unserviced East Germans are venting their frustrations on refugees , and West Germans seem to be looking around for somebody to give East Germany back to . Even if violence could be averted , atomization into mini-states would promise no relief from insecurity . The humiliation of dependence upon and subjugation to an all too familiar dominant power is being replaced by the bafflement of being at the mercy of a poorly perceived , but equally constraining , creditor cartel . A number of the new nations expecting to flee the Second World for the First will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new world order is to promise more than the old , it will not be enough to shun the East European-style " workers " state , " pitting the people as workers against the same people as consumers ; they also must shun the U.S.-style conspiracy of Americans as individuals against America as a society . It also must be recognized that the currently unfettered comparative advantage of the global money-movers leaves the rest of East and West with a comparative disadvantage  --  the inability to produce what they would consume , consume what they produce , or to have a voice in the economic decisions that seal their fate . If the unrich and unpowerful everywhere are to be as one in their vulnerability to money-movers and " market forces , " they can ill afford to remain estranged by such trivial differences as language . For the other new nations or would-be nations of the East , one only can hope that the hard lessons of Yugoslavia have been learned .
