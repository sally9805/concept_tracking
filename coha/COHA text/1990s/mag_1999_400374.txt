<p> Various types of unwanted residues may be present on foods , including pesticides , heavy metals , industrial compounds , animal drugs , mycotoxins that can develop on plant crops , and harmful bacteria . Fortunately , many of these residues are reduced significantly in food processing as well as by practices in the home kitchen . <p> Of course , we live in an imperfect world . We must realize that the food supply  --  safe and healthful  --  nevertheless does contain some unwanted residues , left from farming , processing , and the environment in general . Even if concern with residues makes us decide to purchase only certified organic foods , this still does not provide a safeguard against all potential contaminants . Thus , it is useful to understand the nature of residues , and the means to reduce them , insofar as possible . <p> Minimizing undesirable residues on food is a shared responsibility of surveillance officials , growers , distributors , processors , and consumers . Proper food storage and preparation in the home are helpful practices for reducing residues of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trimming , as well as proper cooking , are useful techniques to reduce unwanted residues . The following examines the nature and extent of various types of unwanted residues , and what we can do to minimize them . <p> Pesticides . In the U.S. Department of Agriculture 's ( USDA ) most recently released yearly report under the Pesticide Data Program , researchers noted that pesticide residues are generally well below the level of established tolerances and that this finding is to be expected because of " the dissipation of residues between the farm and the marketplace and the standard food preparation techniques applied prior to testing . " During processing , as produce is washed , sorted , peeled , blanched , and canned , any pesticide residue is reduced dramatically . <p> For example , according to Henry Chin of the National Food Processors Association , about 85% of the tomato crop is processed for sauce and salsa , up to 45% of apples , for juice and sauce ; and up to 79% of oranges , for juice . According to Chin , the residues on fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to keep the produce pest-free while in transit to markets . However , there is no need for post-harvest treatment of produce intended for processing , because the time between harvesting and processing perishable produce is very brief . In one study , for instance , residues from pesticides such as methyl parathion and chlorpyrifos were found on 10 samples of raw unwashed apples . After being processed into apple juice and apple sauce , no residues were detected in any of the finished products . A <p> Many pesticides penetrate the peel . Others are absorbed through the roots . Nonetheless , according to researchers , washing and peeling produce can remove about one-fourth of pesticide residue . <p> What is the extent of pesticide residues in the food supply ? California supplies more than half of our nation 's fruits and vegetables , so findings from pesticide residue monitoring in California are of interest to everyone . The 1995 annual report of California 's Department of Pesticide Regulations notes that more than 98% of the produce sampled by the state had " either no detectable residues or residues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 132 different commodities taken from seaports , packing sites , and both wholesale and retail outlets , 33.7% had residues within the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 's ( EPA ) acceptable tolerances . About 1.6% of the samples contained illegal residues . The remainder had no detectable residues . These findings approximate ones from the annual reports of the Food and Drug Administration 's ( FDA ) Residue Monitoring Program , conducted in various locations , nationwide . <p> Official Canadian findings are similar . According to a review by the National Cancer Institute of Canada , published in 1997 , an expert panel reported that most foods did not contain detectable pesticide residues , and those that did were well below permitted levels . The review panel concluded that public exposure to pesticides ( in foods , homes , and gardens ) apparently does not contribute significantly to cancer mortality . This conclusion was based on previous studies , begun in 1994 , to review current scientific knowledge about pesticides and cancer . The panel determined that there has been no overall risk increase in the past 15 years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for consumers . The panel also suggested that eating more fruits and vegetables ( and thus potentially ingesting more pesticide residues ) does not raise the cancer risk . The benefits of eating ample amounts of fruits and vegetables far outweigh health risks posed by the low amounts of pesticide residues . <p> These levels may decline further as Integrated Pest Management ( IPM ) is practiced more widely . IPM combines minimal amounts of pesticides with biological and cultural practices to control agricultural pests effectively . In addition , the increasing growth of organic farming may contribute to a further decline in total pesticide residues . ( See " A Win for Consumers , " at page 8 . ) <p> Future applications of new technology might further reduce the need for pesticides in post-harvest applications . Pulsed ultraviolet lasers might replace or lessen pesticide applications . <p>  --  To reduce pesticide residues in the kitchen : Use some of the same techniques used by food processors . Wash produce thoroughly in running water to rid it of surface pesticides that are water-soluble , as well as soil remnants and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davidson , a clinical microbiologist at Mt . Sinai Hospital in Toronto . After an outbreak of foodborne illness traced to E. coli on lettuce , Davidson experimented by purposely contaminating lettuce with bacteria . He found that rinsing or dipping a cored intact lettuce head  --  a common practice of food preparers  --  was insufficient for removing the bacteria . Washing the leaves individually was more effective . <p> You can wash grapes more efficiently if you remove them from the stems , and place them in a colander for rinsing . Soak produce briefly in a container with water and some vinegar , and then rinse thoroughly . Avoid a long soak to prevent water-soluble nutrients from leaching out . Do not use detergents in the water . B Peel and discard the outer leaves of lettuce . If you peel and discard fruit skins from fruit such as apple or pear , remember that there is a trade-off : you may reduce pesticide residue somewhat , but lose dietary fiber . <p> Heavy Metals . Heavy metals can contaminate foods from soils , packaging materials , or processing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exposure Research Laboratory in Cincinnati , reported how toxic metals can contaminate foods . For example , grapefruit juice , stored in opened tin-coated steel cans for two weeks , showed increased heavy metal contamination . Morgan found that coffee , prepared in a lead-containing glazed ceramic mug , leached considerable lead during the first half hour , and lower levels for up to 24 hours . Also , old dinnerware with lead-containing glazes can leach high lead levels into foods if the dinnerware is used in microwave ovens . <p> Morgan tested the effects of different cooking techniques on mercury-contaminated walleye fillets . The mercury level was not reduced either by pan-frying or by smoking the fish . <p> Low levels of arsenic , commonly used as a growth promoter in feed used with laying hens , can accumulate both in the egg yolks and whites . As with mercury , Morgan found that cooking did not lower arsenic residue levels . In some cases , this metal actually increased in the cooked eggs . <p>  --  To reduce heavy metal residues in the kitchen : Transfer any remaining food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Avoid other undesirable interactions of foods with metals that can leach lead , cadmium , or other toxic metals . For example , do not store acidic foods in galvanized vessels , or make lemon sherbet in a metallic ice-cube tray . Use microwave-safe containers in this appliance . Limit your consumption of lake fish from any area known or suspected of being contaminated with heavy metals . Some fish , such as swordfish , are natural mercury accumulators . Restrict your consumption of such fish . <p> Industrial Contaminants . Although U.S. manufacture of PCBs ( polychlorinated biphenyls ) was discontinued in 1977 , PCBs deposited in the sediment of rivers and lakes have led to continued PCB residues in fish and other aquatic organisms . Dredging , shipping , storms , and marine organisms disturb the sediment and cause the re-introduction of PCBs into water , and result in fish contamination . <p> Processing and cooking can reduce PCB residues , as well as PBBs ( polybrominated biphenyls ) and TCDD ( 2,3,7,8-dibenzo-p-dioxin ) in fish and fish oils , according to Mary Zabik , at Michigan State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat-soluble ; so any process that reduces fat effectively reduces their levels . Zabik found that by trimming visible fat from fish , PCB levels could be reduced up to 95% . <p> Others found that , by removing the bellyflap and the fat-containing lateral line in raw fish , PCBs could be reduced in chinook salmon by 40% ; in carp and blue fish , from 19% to 33% ; and in walleye , by 20% . <p> By baking , broiling , or pan-frying , from 20% to 35% of the PCBs could be removed from Great Lakes fish . Although char-broiling and smoking of foods are undesirable practices because they produce mutagens , it was found that PCB residue could be eliminated completely by smoking Lake Michigan carp . ( See " Risky Cooking Practices : Do n't Get Burned , " CR , May 1985 . ) Char-broiling reduced the contaminant by about 45% . Baking and pan-frying also reduced PCBs by about 45% . <p> In other studies , residue reduction of PCBs by cooking fish was less effective , and depended on the species . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimally in Chinook and coho salmon . However , broiling of siscowets ( lake trout ) reduced PCBs by 53% and roasting or microwaving , from 26% to 34% . <p> In PCB-contaminated blue crabs , the hepatopancreas contains the highest concentration of residue . By removing this organ before blue crabs are boiled or steamed , it was found that PCBs were reduced in the claws by 25% ; and in the body muscles , by 33% . <p> Residues of Aroclor , a PCB compound , were found in experiments to remain during various stages of processing edible oils , until the step of deodorization . At that point , the residues were eliminated . In other experiments , residues were eliminated or reduced by other treatments . Shrimp sun-dried for 36 hours lost all Aroclor . Shrimp treated with sodium nitrate lost all Aroclor after 30 hours . Freeze-drying reduced Aroclor residues in shrimp by about 40% ; and in eggs , by about 25% . <p> Processing and cooking of meat , poultry , and fish can reduce PCB levels significantly , mainly by rendering out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that PCB reduction from the raw to the cooked state in chicken was 56.1% in the drumstick , 69.7% in the breast pieces , 55.9% in the thigh meat ; 60.8% in the thigh skin ; and 91.2% in the fat-containing flesh ( the adipose tissue ) . <p>  --  To reduce industrial contaminants in the kitchen : Because PCB residues are higher in fatty tissues of fish , reduce the residues by trimming all visible fat before cooking the fish . Avoid eating the internal organs of crab and lobster . Discard the broth in which flesh foods have been cooked , if they are suspected of having PCB residues . Select ocean fish rather than fresh water fish . <p> Animal Drugs . Monitoring drug residues in the food supply from food-producing animals is a responsibility shared by the USDA 's Food Safety and Inspection Service ( FSIS ) and the FDA 's Center for Veterinarian Medicine ( CVM ) . C <p> The CVM Tissue Residue Reduction Program has both a preventive and regulatory approach , to ensure that consumer exposure to drug residues in edible tissue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and recovers information gathered during FDA and state on-site follow-ups of reported violative tissue residues . In tracking these cases , the data , identified from FSIS 's monitoring and surveillance programs , can identify specific slaughterhouses and animals . Data are collected from the Tissue Residue Information Management System ( TRIMS ) , a database of information generated by FDA follow-up investigations and from FSIS 's violative residues information with domestic meat and poultry . The number of cases fluctuates , but several thousand violative residue cases occur yearly . The drugs most frequently identified as causing residues include penicillin , streptomycin , oxytetracycline , sulfamethazine , tetracycline , gentamicin , and neomycin . <p> The latest CVM report on drug residue violations ( ending Fiscal Year 1995 ) concerned mainly bovine animals ( 95% ) ; and 3.6% involved swine and 0.4% poultry . ( The remainder concerned equine and minor species . ) Among the bovine violations , the most involved veal , followed by dairy and beef cows . With imported meats included in the yearly figures for the first time in FY 1995 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug residues in meats showed that reduction of these medications varies widely , depending on the type of compound and the cooking method used . According to William Moats , of USDA 's Meat Science Research Laboratory at Beltsville , Maryland , some antibiotic residues are reduced " in ordinary cooking of meat by procedures such as frying , grilling , or roasting even to well-done ' temperatures in the center . " Moats found that these cooking procedures decreased residues of some drugs ( oxytetracycline , chlorotetracycline , and penicillin G ) depending on the duration and temperature of the cooking . However , even after the meat was well cooked , residues of some drugs remained , including clenbuterol and sulfamethazine . ( See " Sulfamethazine Residues in Food , " CR , February 1989 . ) <p> Heating meat only to " rare , " in addition to posing a risk of foodborne illness , results in very little reduction of drug residues . More significant reduction occurs when the meat is cooked to a " well-done " stage . However , results vary from drug to drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would be necessary to cook most meat for several hours at very high temperatures , in water , milk , meat broth , or other liquids , and then discard the juice . Such processings would render the meat less nutritious and less palatable . An additional problem , according to Moats , is that these drug residues usually are not distributed evenly throughout meat tissues . <p>  --  To reduce animal drug residues in the kitchen : The sole means of reducing drug residues that may be present in flesh foods is to cook them thoroughly in liquid , and then discard the liquid . Consumers need to rely on the safety network developed jointly by the USDA and the FDA , with various monitoring programs devised by these agencies , and seizures of foods that are found to have violative levels of drug residues . <p> Mycotoxins . Another worrisome group of residues are mycotoxins , produced by molds that may contaminate crops . ( See " Mycotoxins : A Significant Public Health Problem , " CR , June 1989 . ) Some 400 mycotoxins have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others are regarded as carcinogenic . Many grain crops and soybeans can be contaminated , and indirectly affect other foods such as milk , cheese , and meat if the animals are fed mycotoxin-contaminated feed . The important grain mycotoxins include aflatoxins , fumonisins , zearalenone , and deoxynivalenol . <p> Considerable differences exist in the effectiveness of various processings intended to destroy mycotoxins , reports L.B. Bullerman , of the University of Nebraska 's Department of Food Science . Methods used to reduce mycotoxin residues include programs of breeding , control of storage conditions , and decontamination of grains by physical , chemical , and biological means . Heating or roasting of aflatoxin-contaminated grains produced only small reductions of the toxins . Hand sorting reduced the contamination level somewhat . The most effective method was the use of ammonia . However , this method is not approved by the FDA for grain that is intended for human consumption . <p>  --  To reduce mycotoxins in the kitchen : Store grains , flour , or peanuts in tightly-closed containers in a dry place . Discard any that smell or appear moldy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of harmful bacteria can contaminate foods . Thermal heating of food , such as cooking or pasteurization , has been used traditionally to kill harmful bacteria . Several new techniques have been developed that do not depend on heat . <p> One approach uses brief pulses of high-intensity white light to kill micro-organisms on the surfaces of perishable foods . Laboratory tests demonstrated that up to 95% reduction of Salmonella could be achieved on meats . The same process can be used with water , food packaging , and medical and pharmaceutical products . Other approaches include oscillating magnetic fields , high hydrostatic pressure , and bacterial destruction by low-voltage , low-current electrical treatment in various salt solutions used as electrolytes . All of these techniques bypass irradiation , a system that has official approval but has not been embraced enthusiastically by most food producers or consumers . ( See " A New Food Safety Technique " and " Fighting Foodborne Disease with Radiation , " CR , March and September 1996 , respectively . ) For milk , the process known as microfiltration removes nearly all bacteria prior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future , ozone may be used as a safer substitute for chemical disinfectants and sanitizers in food processing . It is more powerful than chlorine in deactivating a very large number of virulent organisms . Although ozone use has not yet been approved in the United States for food use , it is approved as GRAS ( Generally Recognized as Safe ) to treat bottled water , and in bottle water plants . It has long been used in Europe by the food industry . <p> Ozone does not remain in water for any length of time . Thus , its use may be considered as a process rather than as a food additive . There would be no safety concern about consumption of residual ozone in food products . Any by-products produced by ozone in treating foods are similar to normal oxidation products . They do not contain chlorine , and therefore are thought to be less likely to have any deleterious health effects than the by-products of chlorine treatment . <p>  --  Reduce bacteria in the kitchen . The oft-given advice deserves repetition . Kitchen cleanliness and personal hygiene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reheating , frequent handwashing , and avoidance of cross-contamination have become mantras for food preparers . Remember that we all ingest some harmful bacteria in foods . The healthy person with a strong immune system generally can detoxify a limited amount , but a person with an impaired immune system may be at risk even with a small amount of harmful bacteria . Non-toxic Alternatives <p> Effective January 1 , 2001 , the widely used food fumigant , methyl bromide , will be banned . With the deadline only three crop seasons away , scientists have been racing against time to develop non-toxic alternatives , including heat , cold , diatomaceous earth , traps , biological controls in the field , cultural practices and management systems , fumigating with metham sodium , and irradiation . Officially approved techniques of hot forced air and vapor heat are used successfully in Hawaii to kill three types of damaging fruit flies . Also , approved irradiation of papaya , carambola , and lychee kills fruit flies . Experiments in progress show promise to control insect pests of apples , pears , and blueberries by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional perspective : <p>  --  " What 's the Threat of Chemicals In Food ? " <p>  --  " Low-Level Drug Residues in Food , " April 1994 . <p>  --  " Pesticide Residues in Your Children 's Food " and " Another Perspective ... Nature 's Way , " August 1993 . <p>  --  " Do Pesticides Cause Cancer ? " December 1991 . <p>  --  " Does Everything Cause Cancer ? " May 1989 . <p> A In general , pesticide residues are reduced in cooking , but exceptions have been discovered . Processing actually may increase the level of some undesirable residues . For example , EBDC ( **26;854;TOOLONG ) is a fungicide that is officially restricted for use with crops , due to the hazards discovered with its breakdown product , ETU ( ethylene thiourea ) . ETU , fed to laboratory animals , was shown to cause liver and throat cancer , as well as fetal abnormalities . When EBDC-treated vegetables were cooked , the ETU level in raw tomatoes was found to increase 10 to 90 times in the cooked tomatoes . Depending on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amounts of ETU residues were generally about 40 to 50 times higher in the cooked than in the raw vegetables . <p> B Some groups have recommended washing produce in a weak solution of dishwasher detergent . This practice is frowned upon by scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration . Chemicals used in dishwashing detergents could be absorbed into porous foods and be ingested . These two agencies reported that detergents , soaps , and special commercial products designed to wash produce are unnecessary . According to a consumer food-marketing specialist at the University of California at Davis , about 90% of pesticide residues can be removed by washing the produce thoroughly under running water . <p> C Both agencies have several branches devoted to this program . FSIS operates a National Residue Program ( NRP ) for surveillance and testing , to ensure that the nation 's meat and poultry supply does not contain unlawful drug residue levels . At present , NRP is undergoing reorganization to prepare for the transition to a HACCP-based residue Program . ( for Hazardous Analysis and Critical Control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Center for Veterinarian Medicine ( CVM ) is responsible for ensuring that edible products intended for human consumption such as meat , milk , and eggs obtained from animals , treated with new animal drugs , do not contain unsafe drug residue levels . Also , CVM enables the marketing of animal drugs , food additives , feed additives , feed ingredients , and animal devices that are judged to be safe to animals , humans , and the environment . <p> ILLUSTRATIONS <p> By Beatrice Trum Hunter <p> <p> Mrs. Hunter is food editor of CR . <p>
