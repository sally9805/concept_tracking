<p> With the whine of table saws and the hubbub of the crowd as a backdrop , Thomas Stewart , 7 , stood silently at an exhibitor 's table at the recent American Woodworker Show and carefully ran his fingers over a large , dark-stained carving of an American Eagle . <p> Thomas , who has helped in his father 's shop since he was 4 , may be the future of a craft now practiced by more than 18 million people , most of them middle-aged men . He also can be viewed as the latest apprentice in an ancient art form stretching back to the day someone first picked up a piece of wood and realized he could carve a stool rather than continue to sit cross-legged on the ground . <p> But his father , Kenneth Stewart , 42 , like many woodworkers these days , is less romantic about the craft . " I think woodworking is a dying art , " said the elder Stewart , a computer software programmer from Forest Hill , Md. , who learned woodworking growing up in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left . Mostly , people do it as a hobby . Look around this show and you 'll see lots of men here who do mental work . Woodworking is exercise for them , a way to relax . " <p> There 's no doubt that woodworking today , particularly among amateurs , is a robust activity . David Sloan , editor and publisher of American Woodworker , said his magazine 's circulation had grown from 20,000 to 310,000 over the past 10 years . The magazine sponsored the show , which was held Nov. 7-9 outside Philadelphia and drew nearly 12,000 people . <p> This is the third such annual show in Philadelphia and the largest yet . This year , the magazine added shows in Detroit and Los Angeles and plans to continue sponsoring at least three shows a year . <p> " It seems like woodworking is bound to increase as baby boomers age , " said Sloan . " We know the peak woodworking years are age 40-plus because that 's when people have the money to buy the tools , and the hardest career-building and kid-raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . " <p> Sloan thinks the widespread availability of power tools through the large home-center chains has been key to the growth of woodworking 's popularity . " This is a relatively new phenomenon , " he said . " Ten years ago , most people did n't even know most of those specialized tools existed . The only place the average consumer saw power tools was Sears , and they were limited in what they carried . Now , someone without much skill or strength can cut straight , square lines without needing to practice the way they would have with hand tools . " <p> But Sloan has doubts about the post-baby boom future of the craft . " People our age were exposed to it in woodshop , " said Sloan , who is 47 . " So down the road when they were looking for a hobby , they already had had some exposure to it . Kids today are n't getting that anymore . School shops are closing all over the place and being replaced by computers and more career-track things . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they get older . " <p> According to a 1995 survey done by the magazine , the 17 million non-professional woodworkers in this country are about 84 percent men with an average age of 45 and an average household income of almost $ 48,000 . In 1994 , according to the survey , apparently the only one ever done in this field , they spent more than $ 6.9 billion on their hobby . <p> The conventional wisdom is that it takes a $ 1,000 investment in basic tools to get started . <p> The same survey found that there are 1.4 million professional woodworkers in this country . These include people who do carpentry , cabinetmaking , architectural woodworking , furniture making , millwork , and furniture design . With an average age of 41 , professionals are slightly younger than their hobbyist counterparts but also report an average family income of more than $ 48,000 . Nearly half of them said that in 1994 they derived more than $ 50,000 from woodworking activities . <p> Even so , woodworking never has been an easy way to make a living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , it usually takes a woodworker many years to begin earning a living wage . <p> Master cabinetmaker Frank Klausz , who attended the show here , said he had that experience . Although his workshop in Pluckemin , N.J. , now produces furniture that sells for thousands of dollars to wealthy furniture lovers in the nearby New York suburbs , he worked for many years before he was able to support his family , he said . <p> Today he believes there 's a good market for woodworkers , particularly those like him who make furniture . He thinks this will become even more true as quality antiques become harder to find . <p> " People want fine furniture in their home , but when a Chippendale highboy costs hundreds of thousands of dollars , few can afford it , " said Klausz , a third-generation cabinetmaker . " If we can make the same piece for $ 5,000 to $ 10,000 , more people will seek out cabinet shops . " <p> Klausz had the benefit of spending many years in a formal apprenticeship program in his native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 72 percent of the hobbyists and 64 percent of the professional woodworkers in the American Woodworker survey said they were largely self-taught . <p> Although about half of both groups said they also received some instruction from relatives or friends , almost half said they first learned the craft in a school shop class . These are the classes that today are disappearing . <p> " The traditional kid does n't encounter woodworking in school anymore , " said William Snelson , an Oklahoma educator who is vice president of the technology education division of the Alexandria , Va. - based American Vocational Association . Snelson said the high cost of liability insurance is helping to drive this change . " Insurance is a tremendous financial load for a school district , " he said . " It only takes one or two lawsuits to break a budget . " <p> In many schools , shop classes are being replaced by something called career exploration technology education . Content and national standards for tech ed are still being developed , but schools that use it typically rotate their students through 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various career fields , such as computer animation , construction or transportation . The emphasis is on understanding what a field is and how it works , rather than on mastering particular skills used in that field . <p> " The idea is to give students the basic knowledge that will help them later on , " said Pamela Newberry , a senior project associate helping to develop curriculum content . Administered by the International Association of Technology Education , headquartered in Blacksburg , Va. , the project is funded by the National Science Foundation and NASA . <p> " We 're not teaching them to build a house . We 're teaching them that building a house requires planning and following certain design rules . And we 're giving them enough literacy so that when they go out to apply for a job . . . they can be trained for the needs of that particular job site . " <p> While this general exposure to different vocational fields might be helpful in introducing students to a broader range of potential careers , it 's tough on skilled woodworkers like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Luckily , he said , most high schools near him still offer woodworking . These are the places he goes to recruit the young trainees for his shop . <p> Another nail in the woodworking coffin has been the explosion in computer technology . Young people who once might have learned the difference between a dado and a dovetail or a jigsaw and a router by building a bird house in dad 's workshop now spend their free time at the computer . Even woodworkers find it hard to blame them . " My kids are very good at computers , " said Ken Stewart , who has two children older than Thomas . " My daughter is very good at woodworking , but she 'd rather do computers . It does n't bother me . It 's just the way things are . " <p> The same thing happens to children of professional woodworkers such as Stuart Mortimer , a retired London policeman who took up woodworking full-time eight years ago . He was on display at the woodworking show turning what was billed as the world 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet by 3 1/2 feet and was cut from a 340-year-old piece of Sitka spruce . <p> Neither of Mortimer 's sons is a woodworker , he said , although the one with the creative bent has a " very good " job using computers in multi-mediadesign . Klausz 's two children also have chosen career paths offering more immediate financial rewards . Although both grew up around his wood shop , he said , his daughter is a teacher and his son is in business . Klausz said he understands because woodworking is a hard way to make a living . He worked for 10 years , he said , before he could support his family . He said professionals must be able to charge at least $ 50 an hour to make any money . <p> " It 's like any kind of artist , " he said . " You struggle . It takes a lot of time and patience . It is hard to learn it because there is no training available . You will spend a lot of hours with no paycheck . You have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lentini is a feature writer in the Philadelphia area .
