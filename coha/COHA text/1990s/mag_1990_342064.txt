MEMPHIS BELLE <P> Directed by Michael Caton-Jones <P> Screenplay by Monte Merrick <P> There was a historic Memphis Belle , one of the armada of B-17s that bravely , and at terrible cost to both sides , failed to bomb Germany into submission during World War II . There was , as well , a previous movie that took its title from that plane : a documentary about its last mission , which director William Wyler made for the government in 1944 . Despite the propaganda imperatives imposed on it , his film was rightly praised for its realistic portrayal of war in the air . <P> Wyler 's daughter Catherine is a producer and the chief instigator of the new , fictive Memphis Belle , which displays the same flaws and virtues as her father 's work . Despite the passage of a demythifying half-century , this well- cast plane crew ( Matthew Modine and Eric Stoltz , among others ) remains as wartime Hollywood insisted on imagining it . These men are of diverse backgrounds , grousing ( but never cynical ) , scared ( but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comical , differences to form a unit that , in both efficiency and common decency , no tyranny could hope to beat . The presence of a smarmy p.r . officer ( John Lithgow ) , eager to exploit the crew in a home-front media campaign celebrating their democratic virtues , signals the filmmakers ' awareness of wartime fabulism . But their own nostalgic prettifications are hardly more realistic , or penetrating . <P> Yet once the Belle is airborne , it is hard to think of any movie that has more vividly portrayed the sheer terror of being in a big tin can as it is kicked through the skies by flak and assaulted by swarms of fighters . In this , its better half , Memphis Belle achieves something like epic proportions . Out of an authentic emotion  --  fear  --  it finally forges the kind of unshakable link with an audience that the sweet , stale cliches of male bonding could never sustain .
