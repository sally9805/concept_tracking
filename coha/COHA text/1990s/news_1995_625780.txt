<p> One would think if Southwest Conference basketball teams needed nothing so much as a few swift kicks in their backsides , enough would have long since been provided . If that is all it takes to build a basketball team , the SWC would seem qualified to join the NBA in next season 's realignment . <p> But this season , the tough-love style of scheduling seems to be working . It might not impress poll voters , but the SWC as a whole is off to a surprisingly encouraging start - in what was expected to be a rebuilding/transition season - because of the way so many of its members have come back after losses . <p> Rice lost at home to No. 1 Kansas , then went to Nashville and one of the nation 's oddest and toughest gyms and upset Vanderbilt , a team coming off a rout of Virginia . <p> Texas blew a late lead to lose at home to then-No. 14 Utah , then went to Chicago and the always-chilly Rosemont Horizon to knock off DePaul . <p> TCU went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home to put together a four-game winning streak . <p> And Texas Tech , which seemed to spend all of last season taking to the road and losing ( to Wisconsin , Arizona , Kentucky in Cincinnati , Temple and Washington State ) , took its first trip this season and ran away from Oklahoma 81-69 . <p> " " Last year , we felt like we had a good enough team to win on the road and did n't do that , " Tech coach James Dickey said . <p> " " There were hard lessons we learned last year . We have eight players that were on the team last year that did a good job with younger players . They did a good job with what you have to do to win on the road . " <p> Rice might have shown the most obvious improvement after experiencing defeat . <p> " " In the game against Kansas , we learned the level of intensity you have to play with when you 're playing a team of that caliber , " Owls coach Willis Wilson said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as good as any team in the country . I certainly think they 're the No. 1 team , and that 's what they are , the No. 1 team , not individuals . <p> " " Even though they have big-time players , everyone plays with a lot of intensity and hustle . Everyone will get on the floor . <p> We had a little bit of a carry-over in that regard at Vanderbilt . " After his players created many opportunities against Kansas , Wilson said they became more confident they could play against top competition and more determined to take advantage of the chances they had . <p> " " In the shootaround before the Vanderbilt game , the guys themselves refocused , " Wilson said . " " They saw they had to finish things . " There is nothing new about scheduling tough to teach some lessons . Teams have won national championships ( Louisville , North Carolina State , Duke ) with that kind of thinking . Every SWC coach has said his team will be better off when his players get used to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western Athletic Conference and Conference USA . <p> Texas , after losing early much as it did Saturday at Louisville , captured the past two SWC championships and has won NCAA Tournament games in five of coach Tom Penders ' seven seasons . <p> In the past two seasons , Texas was beaten soundly by Connecticut , Kentucky , Oklahoma and Florida but later won Tournament games and had chances to win against Michigan and Maryland . <p> " " This is kind of a typical start for us , " Penders said of the 3-2 Longhorns . " " Last year , we were 2-2 and took a thumping at Florida . The year before , we had a 26-8 record but we started 2-4 . This year 's schedule is probably the toughest one we ever played . I 'm not disappointed with the record . I 'm not discouraged . <p> " " That 's why we got rid of the Longhorn Classic . It was a joke . <p> We wanted to play tougher teams . Unless people are blind or have n't been following what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven Tournaments because of who we 're playing . <p> " " We could be 5-0 with careful scheduling . Players could be thinking , ' Cool , we 're fine , we do n't have to play any harder . <p> The offense is fine . ' You do n't find out unless you play good people . What good is false confidence ? Who are you fooling ? " <p> The NCAA basketball committee was never fooled . And perhaps SWC players were not either . This season , they seem more convinced they can play well after losing than they were when they won against weak competition . And they have moved toward proving it . <p> Around the league <p> Not all theirs - Texas ' SWC football championship earned it a spot in one of the big-buck bowl games , the Nokia Sugar Bowl . <p> But the Longhorns will not pocket quite the bundle that many might think . <p> The Sugar Bowl payout will be a cool $ 8.3 million , more than any bowl had ever handed out before this season . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drastically increased payouts in exchange for the first two picks of available teams and a chance at a national championship matchup one of every three seasons as part of the new bowl alliance . <p> Texas , however , will divide the loot in a revenue-sharing plan devised for this one season in which the SWC has an alliance representative . <p> Texas will claim the first $ 1.6 million off the top and then receive a share of an eight-way split of the rest , about $ 837,500 . After Texas spends as much as $ 1.2 million on the trip , the athletic department will pocket $ 1.237 million , a nice piece of change if not quite $ 8.3 million . <p> Texas A &M,; headed to the Builders Square Alamo Bowl , and Texas Tech , bound for the Weiser Lock Copper Bowl , will likely spend all they earn . The Alamo Bowl payout is $ 1 million . A &M; will keep $ 800,000 and split the rest with the league . Tech will keep the entire $ 750,000 Copper Bowl payout . <p> Tech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though the Alamo Bowl could be a bus ride away , A &M; will likely spend its entire bowl income on the trip and the stay in San Antonio . <p> Ticket window - Texas might receive a different sort of benefit from its Sugar Bowl trip : a list of potential customers who wanted bowl tickets , requested bowl tickets and did n't get bowl tickets because they had not purchased season tickets . <p> Texas sold its allotment of about 17,000 tickets , returning 2,500 ticket applications . Only Longhorn Foundation members , season-ticket holders and students received tickets . Texas ticket manager Michael Bos said he could have received many more applications , but Texas stopped accepting requests it would not fill after three days . <p> But with Texas ' season-ticket level well below many of college football 's attendance leaders , the demand for Sugar Bowl tickets would seem to be a chance to create a demand for season tickets . <p> " " I 'm sure we hold on to those lists , " athletic director DeLoss Dodds said . " " You try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's calling or if they would be interested in season tickets . But I would think those are good lists . " <p> Texas ' season-ticket sales have held steady in recent years , this year at 27,388 , excluding students . Its all-time best was 38,301 in 1984 . After taking care of the 1,500-ticket student allotment and the foundation members and season-ticket holders that requested Sugar Bowl tickets , the remaining 1,800 tickets went to students . <p> " " We are a university , " Bos said . " " We have 48,000 students . <p> We 'd like to make them habitual attendees at our games . " <p> Wrecking Crew II ? - Texas A &M's; basketball team is ranked second nationally in defense , allowing just 49 points per game ( Princeton , as usual , allows the fewest ) . But what might be most impressive is that A &M; has done it without keeping a foot pressed hard on the brakes of its offense . <p> This is not to say A &M; is running and gunning . But the Aggies have held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebounding rather than a simple slowdown . <p> The Aggies allow just 28.3 rebounds per game , by far the fewest in the league , have collected 14.8 steals , by far the most , and allow a field-goal percentage of just 41 percent . <p> Tests make for test - As usual , SMU faces a more difficult mix of its academic and athletic side than other schools this week . <p> SMU , whose football team had to practice at night because the school did not allow the priority registration needed for players to keep afternoons open for practice , will have several players rushing from finals to the Mustangs ' basketball game Saturday against McMurry . <p> It is not unusual for finals to create practice problems or to force long gaps in the schedule . Usually , however , games are not scheduled for the same evening as finals . Several SMU players , however , complete tests at 6 p.m. prior to the game at 7:30 . <p> " " I 've never actually seen it like this , with finals going through Saturday and kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mike Dement said . " " I 've seen kids drained totally mentally to where they ca n't pass the ball or catch the ball . <p> I 've seen kids frustrated and looking to take it out on something . " <p> Bragg sidelined - Guard Juan Bragg , last season 's outstanding freshman at TCU , reinjured his right hamstring in practice last week . He is considered out two to three weeks , but TCU coach Billy Tubbs said the injury is so severe he would not be surprised to see Bragg miss the entire season . Tubbs will work point guards Anthony Burks , a transfer from Texas A &M,; and Jeff Jacobs together . <p> Odds and ends - Texas football coach John Mackovic received a contract offer last weekend , but the process could extend well into January . He was offered a new contract rather than an extension , but more negotiations are expected . Perhaps Houston 's Jimmy Herndon should have been a shoo-in All-American . It is likely no one else was first-team all-conference in two leagues . Herndon was a consensus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not begin until next season , he was named to the C-USA first team . <p> TCU freshman forward Damion Walker , the SWC 's second-leading scorer ( 24.1 points per game ) was named SWC Player of the Week , making him the first freshman so honored since Texas Tech 's Lance Hughes in 1992 . Walker averaged 27 points and 17 rebounds in two TCU wins and has four consecutive double-doubles . <p> The last word - From Texas basketball coach Tom Penders on playing a tough schedule : " " We 're the only team in the ( current ) Southwest Conference that has won an NCAA Tournament game in the last seven years . This is our formula . Whether we get there or not , I do n't know . It 's a classic rebuilding year for us . I think this is going to be a very good team . It may not be until February . But we have a lot of good players that will find themselves . It just takes time . " <p> NOTES : Jonathan Feigen covers the Southwest Conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
