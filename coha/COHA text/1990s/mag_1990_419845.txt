<p> Fifty men , fine-boned and thin as teenage boys , stand on the beach , expectation on their faces . Some huddle together silently ; others only stare out to sea , where the Greek passenger vessel Teera is bucking and rolling toward them , its vast 13,665-ton bulk pushed toward the land by one remaining engine , a tricky tide and crashing waves . <p> Then a hiss , as the end of a rocket-fired steel cable speeds overhead , flying from the bridge of the Teera to land on the beach beside a dilapidated Bedford truck engine powering a winch . <p> A hush . Then , with a yelp the men break ranks , scattering in all directions , some toward the sea and the Teera . Others grab the cable . A few , far out in tiny fishing boats below the Teera 's prow , jump onto the ship 's anchor , already being slowly lowered , and as agile as acrobats , scurry up its chain and quickly attach a second , shore-linked cable to it . It looks like tug-of-war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man , connect the two cables to a 115-horsepower engine . The winch strains . " Haria ! "  --  " Pull ! "  --  shouts a labor boss in Pashto , the language of these Pathan tribesmen . " Haria ! Udi ! "  --  " Pull ! Lift ! " <p> On the beach the temperature rises , reaching 104 degrees . The surf crashes before us . Today is the high tide of the Arabian Sea . Only twice a month does the tide rise this high . Two human chains in assorted headgear and pajama-like clothes heave , shout , and pull the cables and the massive links of chain . It looks like tug-of-war between 50 men and the crashing , capricious sea ; the winner 's prize : all 13,665 tons of salvageable steel and brass fittings . <p> The distant Teera , once a proud cruise vessel , is now a humbled hulk . Black , bilious smoke clouds seep from her engine , which has broken down again . Muhammad Siddique , now to be her last pilot , stands with binoculars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his neck . As one of the beaching masters at Gadani , he has been doing this job for 13 years , but the Teera will be the most difficult ship he has ever handled . Her draught is enormous  --  24 feet forward , 30 feet aft , and both of her engines keep breaking down . Along with a 25-man crew , Siddique must guide the crippled vessel to the spot where the tidal current is strongest , and where he will get the maximum push from the onshore wind . He must run the ship aground as close as possible to the water 's edge so that the work teams can take over and pull her onto the shore . <p> He is guided only by brief bursts of walkie-talkie commands and two beaching flags , bright red and blue against the brown outline of Gadani Beach . As the tide approaches nine feet  --  the highest of the day  --  Captain Siddique lines up the Teera in her slot , absolutely perpendicular to the beach and right between two other vessels , a Russian passenger liner and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nationality . ( Of the myriad ships that have been beached over the past two decades , only a few originally flew the Hag of Pakistan . ) <p> There is high expectation in the swarm of men assembled near the marker flags . The doomed ship means money in their pockets  --  and furious , hard work . Around them the beach is littered with three-inch steel cable . The old Bedford engine moans . " Stay away from the cable ! " a company director yells at me . " Stay away from the winch . It 's just too dangerous . Anything can snap . " Then he smiles sheepishly ; I can tell he thinks it is total idiocy for any correspondent , let alone a woman , to be here at all . He may be right . Gadani Beach , already the cemetery of some 6,000 ships , is a forbidding and chaotic place . <p> The Teera strains under her one remaining engine . After firing the cable to shore , Siddique has ordered full speed ahead . By now the Teera should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 when she hits bottom , still a thousand feet from land . <p> For a few moments , there is only the sound of the surf . Then , with a cry , the barefoot work teams dash into the shallow sea . Now the two steel cables  --  one lashed to the Teera 's swinging anchor , the other affixed to her bridge  --  and the winch 's chugging truck engine come into play . Each time a large wave passes , lifting the ship briefly from the bottom , a young man , barely a teenager , guns the engine , straining the cable to pull the ship shoreward . <p> In unison , as in a finely choreographed ballet , 50 men brace the cable , which is slung over their left shoulders and under their right arms , and pull , heaving and shouting to one another , bringing the Teera closer to shore . The cable pulls taut against their narrow , bony backs . They have little equipment heavier than the 115-horsepower engine attached to the straining winch . The young operator guns the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pull , laugh and leap  --  two agitated , human chains . For 2 hours 8 minutes , as the tide rises and the engine groans , almost inch by inch the Teera is hauled in . <p> The luxurious flagship of the Greek Chandris Line , Teera plied the waters of the Aegean when I sailed aboard her in 1969 . Now her once smartly painted hull is faded , her lifeboats rusted in place . Like the countless ships dismembered here for scrap since 1972 , she grew too old and expensive to maintain in a world given over to air travel , and in the face of great technological advances in ship design . Now she is prey to skillful swarms of Pathan tribesmen . <p> Gadani Beach , where the desert confronts the Arabian Sea , is only an hour from Karachi , Pakistan 's former capital . But time rolls backward here . In the past 18 years these Pathans have nibbled away at spent ships , beaching them , stripping them , breaking them , with wrenches , sledgehammers , a few blowtorches and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beached at Gadani , the Pathan tribesmen slice away at it in much the same way that the Inuit carve up a whale . They use nothing more sophisticated than a handful of cranes and forklifts , and a few obsolete winches and engines , salvaged from long-forgotten ships . Anything that can be sold anywhere in the world is stripped , unbolted and carried away : engines , railings , crankcases , detached bows and sterns . The men who break up the ships can earn as much as $9.50 for a 12-hour day , a decent wage by Pakistani standards . As many as 150 ships at a time <p> Over the years the number of ships undergoing demolition at Gadani has varied from 5 to as many as 150 at a time , depending on the season ( beaching is difficult during a monsoon ) , the number of ships on the market , the ability of wreckers to outbid competitors . More important have been the Pakistani government 's tax policies , which seem to change with the tides . A ship that has been decommissioned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London . <p> In addition to those in Pakistan , companies in Taiwan , China , South Korea , India , Bangladesh and a few other countries have bid for ships on the international market at so many dollars per ton . While in most businesses the highest bidder gets the prize , this does not necessarily apply in shipwrecking . Because the seller foots the high cost per mile of getting the ship to the shipbreakers , he will often accept a lower bid from a country closer at hand . In recent years the Taiwanese and Koreans have consistently outbid the Pakistanis , but the Gadani wreckers have often acquired ships that were casualties of the nearby war in the Persian Gulf . <p> Many other shipwrecking nations are fortunate enough to have dry docks and highly mechanized equipment . Pakistan has only its six-mile-long beach and the almost legendary skill of the Pathan tribesmen , who come from the northern mountains to make a living tearing ships apart . I stare at these lithe ship destroyers . Most are wearing the shalwar kameez , Pakistan 's national dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed in brown . Waiting for a ship , they cluster on the beach . Their faces dark from the sun , the shipbreakers somehow look like coal miners , covered with tar , dirt and dust . <p> During good years Pathans swoop down on Gadani like an army of picnic ants . It takes from two to six months to reduce a giant vessel to steel plate and salable fittings . Littering the beach like forgotten seashells are funnels , radio equipment , anchors and compasses , mounds of steel plate . At moments of high activity the place is like a cross between a junkyard and a surrealist picture of industrial hell . From the debris of obsolete oil-drilling rigs , cargo ships and tankers , Gadani has produced as much as a million tons of steel a year , and 10,000 tons of other metals  --  mainly copper and brass . In 1989 shipowners sold an obsolete vessel for as little as $110 per ton . But a 10,000-ton ship , once scrapped , has brought as much as a $180,000 profit . Most of the profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is a cosmopolitan center with computers and stock markets . While here in Gadani a multimillion-dollar shipbreaking industry is wed to the capriciousness of nature , the power of the moon , and the legions of small men who ferry drinking water to their work crews in buckets balanced on bamboo poles across their shoulders . <p> Naturally , I had planned my trip to Karachi to coincide with the monthly high tide , and as I wandered through the new international airport , full of electronic equipment and chrome , I puzzled over Gadani , only 40 miles away , but centuries removed in lifestyle . The road from Karachi to Gadani passes the fourth-century B.C. route once taken by Alexander the Great , then crosses the provincial border into Balochistan , a flinty and arid place that is a crucial geopolitical site . Nestled under Afghanistan and Iran , with a 470-mile coast on the Arabian Sea , it is near the oil lanes of the Persian Gulf . <p> The nomadic Baloch tribesmen , who gave the province its name , appear along the roadways like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high with bedding and children , escorted by flowing herds of sheep and goats . The Baloch have always disdained the artificial lines of the British mapmakers , who literally quartered their vast tribal holdings in the 19th century . Today they continue to come and go , as they 've always done , migrating between their traditional homelands in Pakistan , southern Afghanistan and the eastern fringes of Iran . <p> Gadani Beach is ten miles inside Balochistan . At first glance , it is hard to take in this vast maritime graveyard . Rusting funnels . Parts of engines and switchboards . Light fixtures and toilets and compasses . And heaps and heaps of steel plate . At the edge of the sea , a slice from the midsection of a tanker stands upended in the sand . <p> Farther up the beach are more and more rusty mounds : anchors , drive shafts , pressure tanks , life-boats , even portholes . It is only at the end of Gadani 's six-mile stretch of beach that one comes upon unrecognizable items , a supply of steel constantly being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trucks that ferry scrap inland to rerolling mills . Because their sides and panels are a jumble of folk-art paintings , tinsel and colored , flashing lights , I learn , these trucks are unmistakably from the North-West Frontier Province , bordering Afghanistan , where the Pathans come from . <p> The men leave their wives behind and , once having reached Gadani , live on the beach . In the midst of their jumble of shanties , the minaret of a makeshift mosque prods the skyline . It is made from salvage , an old ship 's mast . Everything at Gadani is . Workers ' quarters , company offices , all built from driftwood and scraps from the sea . An upturned lifeboat serves as a roof for one enterprising worker 's home , but for most of the workers shelter consists of tar-paper shacks , with as many as six men sleeping shoulder-to-shoulder . There are open sewers . It is 40 miles to the nearest doctor . On the day I arrived , green mourning flags flew from four of the ramshackle huts . Nobody would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned that the death fee of 15,000 rupees ( $710 ) promised the families back home is rarely paid by the shipbreaking companies . It is more cost-effective to scare any stray relatives away . <p> Nearly all unskilled , the workers are recruited from scores of poor and desolate villages along the Afghan frontier by local tribal chieftains  --  who get a finder 's fee . The workers ' average age is 25 . Their beach bosses often do n't know their names . Some stay for a season , others for ten years , returning home to visit every few years and sending their pay back to wives and children . Some die at Gadani , fallen from the ships they work on or crushed by sheets of steel . Day begins at 7 A.M. and ends at 7 P.M. There are no holidays and the work is seven days a week . <p> Yet the men continue to come . In a big year as many as 25,000 have traveled a thousand miles south from the cold , distant mountains to this sweltering stretch of the Arabian Sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipbreakers take pride in their ferocious work , having a tough conviction that only they can chop a ship to pieces under the conditions they endure . They are proud that in three or four months 125 men can devour 5,000 tons of steel . <p> A ship like the Teera will take longer , maybe six months , not only because she is so big , but because passenger ships are more complex . A month and a half is needed just to remove berths and cabins , woodwork , mirrors and swimming pool . Then the largest pieces of her superstructure  --  some weighing 20 tons  --  will be slid off on wires from her deck to the beach , almost a hundred feet below . Then the men  --  at least 175 of them by now , but only 50 with any kind of skill  --  will clamber aboard , ripping , stripping , draining , chipping , bashing and torching what 's left . Nothing is still at Gadani . Everything moves . Already the teams are working like demons . Small forms , silhouetted in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hauling . I see crystal chandeliers and silver being lugged away . A 4,500-ton Japanese oil rig , 1 am told , even provided a complete helipad . <p> I watch the welders , usually protected by goggles , cutting ever-smaller pieces of steel . Sparks and blazing metal fly through the air . I watch as the ten-ton plates that made up the hull of a nearby tanker slide off its frame on wires , gliding gracefully through the air from the deck to the shoreline , 120 feet below . They land with a huge thud , even though the sound is heavily muffled by the crashing waves . Instantly six men scramble toward them with oxyacetylene torches to slice the plate into one-ton sections . <p> Aboard the tanker a small mob of workers in embroidered prayer caps attack the ship with sledgehammers and crowbars . Others assault portholes and railings . Twenty men , with a large sheet of riveted-steel bulkhead on their shoulders , struggle toward a waiting truck . A labor boss shouts " Sah aghiftal , sah wistal ! " at them , Pashto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives them strength <p> Nearby , a 5,000-ton Egyptian bulk carrier is having her whole bottom pulled off . She has been cut into four sections , each attached to a thick line . Now one of the lines is linked to a rusted winch , powered by a 35-horsepower diesel engine . The waves crash in . Eight men link the line over their shoulders and under their arms and , as the 50 brought in the Teera , pull the Egyptian ship 's rusted bottom up onto the beach . Shouts . Hand wavings . A dizzying din . I ask a labor chief , a mean-looking man wearing a turban of green and white , the colors of Pakistan , why Gadani 's workers make so much noise . " When they shout , they exhale , " he tells me matter-of-factly , " and that gives them more strength . " <p> Buyers from Karachi , in starched safari suits , abandon their air-conditioned BMWs to stagger down to the beach , inspecting , weighing , judging , sizing anything they find . A mixed bag of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in canvas and carted off for use in a local sugar mill . There is impromptu barter for small items . Some Russian cordial glasses , " Sputnik " engraved on every one , go to a Karachi banker . I bid against him for 30 minutes , but at $250 the price is too high for me . <p> The nerve center of all this commerce is the cluster of shipbreakers ' Gadani Beach offices , each fashioned from the captain 's quarters of now-forgotten ships . In one that I visited , the chairs and tables , plywood roofing and rickety wooden stairs had all come from different vessels . <p> I met one shipbreaker , Ameen Gokal , first in his Karachi office in the chaotic " old city , " which hugs the port , a far more appropriate transition to Gadani than the city 's sophisticated downtown area . Old Karachi teemed around me : tough-looking Pathan elders with turbans and orange-dyed beards ; cripples and beggars ; street hawkers and sailors  --  a constant , pervasive din . The few women in evidence were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms , they glided silently in and out of storefront shops . <p> Pakistani shipwreckers have known rich and lean years . Huge sums of money have been made at Gadani . Until 1984 , profits on a shipbreaking investment went as high as 300 percent . But that was when Gadani , powered by human muscle and the pull of the moon , had the second-largest shipbreaking industry in the world . In those days only Taiwan outproduced Pakistan . Remembering it , Hassan Jafari , the secretary of the Pakistan Ship Breaker 's Association , said to me , " We could have buried Taiwan , if only we had had the government 's support . " <p> Sometimes the annual influx of hulls for the wrecking at Gadani has been in the hundreds . Sometimes , as in recent years , it has dwindled to fewer than 30 . What is particularly frustrating for the Gadani shipbreakers is that the drastic decline in incoming ships has less to do with the number of ships ready for scrapping on the world shipping markets than with problems peculiar to Pakistan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president , Mohammed Zia ul-Haq , already-high import duties on ships brought in for wrecking were steadily increased at an astonishing rate , making it harder and harder for shipbreakers to show a profit and to cope with foreign competition in the ship-buying market . During the next five years , tariffs kept going up and up not only for the shipwrecking industry but also for the steel rolling business , the primary purchaser of Gadani 's scrap steel . The strong speculation was that Zia imposed the prohibitive import duties to protect from price competition one of the government 's top priorities at the time , the relatively new Pakistan Steel Mills , a Soviet-funded white elephant that has been slow to show promise . <p> A month before his death in August 1988 , President Zia approved an additional excise duty that nearly killed the already-ailing industry . By this time , shipbreakers were having to pay more in import duties on a ship than they had actually paid for the ship itself . After paying the steep duties , other tariffs and workers ' wages , shipbreakers often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salvaged parts for any sort of profit . Many of Pakistan 's 77 shipbreaking companies closed their doors while high-risk speculators propped up the business , hoping government policy would change . <p> Only in the past year , under Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto , have tariffs been somewhat relaxed . The industry is just beginning to recover . If Pakistan 's import duties are reduced enough so that shipbreakers can make a good profit , the current rise in work at Gadani should continue . <p> Ships still carry about 90 percent of the world 's international trade , though some nations , most notably the United States , have all but ceased building ships . Other countries , especially the Soviet Union , have been building freighters and tankers at a fierce rate . The life of a working , oceangoing vessel varies , but ships are constantly wearing out , being wrecked , or losing their competitive edge as carriers to newer and faster vessels . They will remain a steady source of precious scrap steel for years to come . <p> Meanwhile , on the beach at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cries . A Sri Lankan cargo vessel is in sight .
