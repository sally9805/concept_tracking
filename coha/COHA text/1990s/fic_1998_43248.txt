On the morning of July 23 , 1921 , my parents , Cowley and Elizabeth Russet , died in the crash of a zeppelin at the fairgrounds in Fleming Park . They had each paid fifty cents to ride in the gondola , to float and drift over Halifax , the harbor , then back to Fleming Park . <p> That day , I had been sitting with my uncle on the porch of The Lord Nelson Hotel . My uncle was already living there . We had chosen the porch , because he had read in the newspaper that the zeppelin 's route included the sky directly above the hotel . It was a hot day . Coffee after coffee , my uncle was working off a binge , and I was having a sandwich and root beer float . He was just about to scoop a bite of my float with his spoon , when a man-I remember he had a handlebar mustache , and the sleeves of his sweat-soaked white shirt were rolled up to the elbows-ran up the steps and shouted , " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porch , Dr. Moore stood up , removing his cloth napkin from his collar . " Here ! " he shouted back , his hand raised like a schoolboy 's . " Is it my daughter ? " <p> The mustached man stood on a chair . He choked up mid-sentence , but managed to say , " You 're needed at the fairgrounds . There are bodies everywhere ! " <p> What happened next , I can never forget . I yanked at my uncle 's sleeve . " I want to see ! I want to see ! " But he lifted me entirely out of my chair . At age eight , I was a slight boy , and he stood me right on the table . He embraced me so hard , I thought that he would break my ribs . He held on , and it frightened me . I felt the plates and silverware under my shoes , heard the near and distant pandemonium of voices , saw people running from the porch , which was empty of everyone but us in a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches from his and said , " Do not move , DeFoe . You wait right here . You 'll be fine . Sit down , and do n't move an inch , understand ? " <p> My uncle ran into the hotel . I kept standing on the table ; it afforded me the best view of people fanning out along South Park Street , into the Public Gardens . I saw a few men and women wave down horse-drawn carriages , all but tossing money at the drivers . With all the commotion , all the people zigzagging and shouting , two horses reared , whinnied hysterically , and one started backing up its carriage , the carriage tilted , and both driver and woman passenger leapt out . I remember thinking , " Something terrible is happening to all of these grown-ups . " The horse actually backed the carriage up the remaining length of the park ; the driver was chasing it , waving his arms , which may have made things worse . An old pastry chef , Dunsten Brooking-my uncle often got him to concoct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurried right past me , then into the street . I followed his hat bobbing among the rosebushes , until it disappeared across the park . <p> In a few minutes , my uncle came back . There was a woman with him . I had seen her at the hotel . On occasion , my parents would drop me off , and I would do my school homework at a corner table , while my uncle played cards with the bellhops and kept an eye on me . I had seen my uncle kiss this woman near the electric lift . She was very pretty , with red bobbed hair . But awfully nervous now . My uncle set me down on the porch . " Now , DeFoe , " he said , " this is Altoon Markham . We 're good friends . She 's going to be your good friend , too , okay ? And she 's going to stay with you while I- Grown men and women are needed at the fairgrounds . Do you understand ? " <p> " I 'm going with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't . " <p> " We 'll get along just fine , " Altoon Markham said . She was squinting hard , forcing a smile . <p> " At the fairgrounds some people fell down , " my uncle said . " I 'm going to help pick them up . " <p> " Okay . I 'll stay here . But tell Mother and Father where I am . I do n't want them to think I 'm alone . You know what they 're wearing , Uncle Edward . You 'll find them . My father has a new haircut . " <p> " I know he does , " my uncle said . He kissed me on top of my head . <p> " Sweet darling , " Altoon Markham said . " I 'll get you some ice cream . The cooks and waiters have all left , so ice cream 's ours for the taking . We 'll go be ice cream robbers , this one special time , all right ? Cake , too : ' <p> " It 's your birthday , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's expression changed quickly from puzzlement to exaggerated agreement . " Why , yes . In all this excitement , I almost forgot my own birthday . And would n't you like to celebrate with me , DeFoe ? A little party , just the two of us ? " <p> " Do n't let him out of your sight , " my uncle said . <p> He pushed a number of wadded-up dollar bills into Altoon Markham 's hand . He looked at me sternly , lovingly , and with a hint of pity , which I noticed because I had never seen quite that look before , and it made me want to hold Altoon Markham tightly , even though she was a perfect stranger . " Altoon has a shortwave radio in her room , " my uncle said . " It gets London-all sorts of faraway cities . Ask her to show you how it works , okay ? " <p> " If I like it , will you get me one ? " <p> " It 's a deal . I promise . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both my uncle 's and Altoon 's faces betrayed enough to let me know that something very , very wrong had occurred . My uncle ran from the porch . <p> " Edward has nice shoes , " Altoon Markham said , a statement so at odds with every emotion I felt at the moment that I relied on it . <p> " I was with him when he bought that pair , " I said proudly . <p> " Which shoe store , Kerr 's ? " <p> " Yes , ma'am . " <p> " My , my-well , I 'm sure you helped pick them out . And do n't you and Edward both have good taste , then ? Now , let 's sneak into the kitchen now , all right ? " <p> She took my hand , and we walked through the abandoned lobby into the restaurant . She pushed open the white swinging door into the kitchen and walked to the freezer along the back wall . Opening the freezer , she took out containers of three different flavor ice creams . She glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And there 's my cake ! " she said , pointing to a chocolate cake that already had candles on it . Of course , it was not her cake , there were only half a dozen candles . It was not her birthday . All this occurred to me much later . But Altoon and my uncle had promoted this lie in order to make the distraction more intimate . It worked , because when Altoon said , " Dunsten Brooking especially put so few candles on it , to make me feel better about getting older , " I believed her . My uncle had often intimated that everyone who worked at The Lord Nelson Hotel , bellhops , waiters , laundresses , chefs , desk clerks , cleaning ladies , were one big family . They knew secrets about each other , but the secrets never went beyond the porch steps , never got out into Halifax at large . So I felt that Altoon Markham had confided in me . I put my finger to my mouth and said , " Sssshhhh , " like I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice cream , she walked me over to the cake . <p> " How about we sit at an indoor table ? " she said . <p> " Fine by me , " I said . I looked over the flavors . " I 'd just like vanilla . " <p> She returned the other two cartons to the freezer . " I 'll carry the cake , you take the ice cream . Pick any table that 's neat and clean " <p> A few tables had abandoned lunches on them . I chose a table near the park-side window . Altoon set the cake down , scooped out ice cream onto each of our plates . <p> " It 's the custom that I make a wish , " Altoon said , " but guess what ? " She reached into the pocket of her white smock , took out a matchbook , and struck a match . Lighting the candles , she said , <p> " I 'm going to let you make the wish , DeFoe . " <p> " My stomach hurts . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bite of cake and ice cream . <p> " I know . But my stomach hurts . I do n't want to make a wish . " <p> " Well , eat an eency bit of cake . Then we 'll go up to my room . I 'll let you find all sorts of countries on the radio . " She closed her eyes . " I 'll wish something for you , how 's that ? " She blew out the candles . She cut a slice of cake for each of us . By this time , my stomach was cramping ; I actually clutched at it , and Altoon bent over me and said softly , " Come now , darling . Let 's go upstairs , all right ? " <p> " I want my mother and father : ' <p> " Edward 's gone to find them . " <p> We went up to Altoon Markham 's room , which I remember to this very day was number 43 . I saw the big radio on top of her bureau , but had lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bed . It had a quilt , rather than the standard hotel chenille bedspread . I noticed right away that Altoon kept her room homey . I was suddenly exhausted and fell asleep . When I woke up , Altoon was ironing a shirt . " Sleepyhead , " she said , smiling . " I 've brought my work up here , from down in the laundry . I was out of the room just a few minutes . I would n't have left you alone for too long . The bellhops helped me lug this stuff upstairs . " <p> There were four or five baskets of laundry on the floor . <p> " You were out like a light , " she said . <p> " Is my uncle back yet ? " <p> " Not yet , I 'm afraid . I mean , I 'm not afraid , and he did telephone to say he 'd be a while longer . Are you hungry ? " <p> " It 's dark out . " <p> " It got dark while you were sleeping . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised me . I thought maybe you were sick . I felt your forehead , but no fever . " <p> " My parents were out late last night . I stayed up in the hotel lobby till all hours . My uncle was playing cards . It might have been the latest I ever stayed up . " <p> " That explains it , then , " Altoon said , humoring me . <p> " Probably my mother and father are still helping to lift people up . They 're like that . " <p> " Are you hungry ? " <p> " No . And I 'm sorry I ruined your birthday party . " <p> " You did n't ruin it at all , young man . This is nice for me . Just the two of us . I think this is nice , do n't you ? A birthday party , just minus the cake and ice cream , is all . You 're very good company , DeFoe . Asleep and awake : ' <p> " My mother and father would like you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ironing in your house ? " <p> " Not with ironing . Not yet " <p> " You 're old enough to . " <p> " I guess you 're right : ' <p> " How about this as an idea ? You give me the birthday present of letting me teach you how to iron ? You might need to know someday . " <p> " That 's what you want for your birthday ? " <p> " Good practical know-how . Someday , a woman will admire that in you . " <p> " My mother will , I bet . She 'll be surprised I know how to iron . " <p> " Actually , I meant when you were much older . " <p> " That 's a lot of clothes you have to iron . " <p> " I do this much every single day , six days a week . But I have some seniority . I can choose which day of the week I 'm free . It does n't have to be on the weekend , either . I like walking around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You must do my uncle 's clothes , then . Since he lives in the hotel . " <p> " Yes , in fact that 's how we met , Edward and I. He came downstairs to complain about how I 'd ironed his shirts , and I told him they were ironed perfectly well . That was our very first conversation . Quite romantic , eh ? " <p> " My stomach feels much better . " <p> " Strong enough for a lesson now ? " <p> " I think so . " <p> Altoon stood behind me at the ironing board . Mainly she taught me shirts , at first guiding my hand , as I ran the steam iron over a sleeve , back , between buttons . " You learn by doing it , " she said . And within half an hour , I had taken over . Though Altoon kept adding detailed instructions , depending on the type of shirt . " Always check for missing buttons , " she said . " Sprinkle on too much water , you can actually get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " How old are you today ? " I said , folding a shirt like she had just taught me , setting it in a basket . She was sitting on the bed , raging through a magazine , but still looking distracted . " Well . I 'm thirty-one . " <p> " My mother is thirty-three . My father is thirty-three . " <p> " Oh , dear , " Altoon said . " Excuse me . " And she hurried into the bathroom , shut the door , ran the water in the sink , trying to drown out her crying . But she did not . I kept on ironing a shirt . It was a blue work shirt , the kind my uncle wore at the train station . Hearing Altoon 's sobbing , I did not forgive myself for asking how old she was . My own mother had warned me , " Do n't ask a woman her age . " <p> When she came out of the bathroom , Altoon 's face looked dreadful . " Can I just lie down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 've only just met . But I know your uncle Edward quite well . He would n't mind . There 's nothing shameful about it , really , is there ? It 's like I 'm your aunt . You can think of it that way . Worn out after so much ironing , are n't we ? Come over here , all right ? It 's nighttime . Time to sleep . If you ca n't sleep , just lie here with your eyes open . <p> I crawled over the bed to where Altoon had laid down , and she turned off the bedside lamp and embraced me . In the pitch dark . Then , in a short time , by the way she was breathing , I knew she had fallen asleep . I lay awake awhile . But finally , I think I had made myself sick and exhausted with nervous premonition , was why , a few moments later , I so readily slept . And when I woke again , my uncle was lying asleep crosswise at the end of the bed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took so long ? What took so long ? " I said . " Uncle Edward- " <p> He sat up . " Oh , DeFoe . " Altoon was sleeping soundly . " Nephew , I 've got some bad news . <p> And then he told me . <p> I sat in the same place on the bed for at least an hour . I could not stop shaking . Not crying , shaking . I had the quilt wrapped around me . It was not cold in the room . It was a summer 's night . The only thing I remember saying was , " I ironed all those shirts . " My uncle went downstairs and returned with a hot cocoa ; he added a healthy dose of rum , which helped knock me out . The three of us slept with our clothes on , there , on the bed . I woke up once in the night , groggy , alarmed , and thought , for an embarrassed moment , that I had crawled into bed with my parents the way I used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me up early the next morning . " . . . the zeppelin fell in flames to the ground about 12:25 p.m . Terrified spectators- " I turned it off . I saw that my uncle had moved to the rocking chair . He was still asleep . Altoon was gone . The ironing board and iron and folded laundry were nowhere in sight . I went downstairs to the lobby . The newspaper , on its metal stand , had blaring headlines : <p> Zeppelin crash kills 18 passengers and 5 on ground captain and crew perish in accident at fairgrounds <p> The funeral was a week later . I remember that across the cemetery grounds , another victim of the zeppelin crash was being buried . And when I walked with my uncle and Altoon Markham past that funeral , a boy about my age , standing in front of the casket , caught my eye , and we just stared at each other a fleeting instant . It is odd to admit , but I named him . From that day forward , in my memory , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least know why . The name just flew into my head . That night , lying in my bed-and maybe this is just how an eight-year-old would think-I wondered if he named me . <p>
