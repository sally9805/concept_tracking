<p> Thanks for the help <p> Too many times in today 's world the focus is on what is wrong with our society . Whenever possible , equal time should be given to what is good . <p> Approximately three months ago , a group of people began working on a benefit golf tournament to raise money to help with the medical expenses of a local couple . The wife has been fighting cancer for more than 2 1/2 years , and the expenses have been mounting . <p> Many local companies sponsored this event that was held April 28 at Pebble Creek Golf Club in Jonesboro . The event was held on a Friday , a workday , and yet more than 150 attended . Due to the efforts of the committee and all those who sponsored and participated , the tournament was more successful than many similar events . Many were unable to attend , yet they sent word that their thoughts and prayers would be there . <p> We are that couple . The support of our friends and our community has meant more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratitude to all who participated in thoughts , words and effort . <p> Our hope is that everyone who reads this will be blessed by the reminder of all that is still right in today 's world . <p> Turn off Hannity Glenn Kufchak , Stockbridge <p> Herr ( Sean ) Hannity at WGST Radio did not cause the Oklahoma City bombing . However , he publicly supports a number of right-wing radical ideas . <p> He advocates civilians shooting to death unarmed fleeing suspects who try to steal property , in direct violation of the laws of the state of Georgia governing the use of deadly force ( i.e. the Shannon Pugh incident ) . <p> In the aftermath of the tragedy in Oklahoma City , he publicly advocated torturing to death the perpetrators of heinous crimes , in direct violation of the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States . <p> Herr Hannity and his fellow gun-toting comrades believe the right to keep and bear arms includes the right to keep and bear combat weapons . I would n't trust him with a Weed Eater , much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on these issues with my radio - it is turned off . I am also voting with my wallet - I refuse to patronize the sponsors of Hannity 's dangerous ideas . My next vote will be at the polls and it will not be for Herr Hannity 's comrades-in-arms . <p> Mistrust no surprise Carl D. Henson , Fairburn <p> I was not surprised to read that Cobb County Commission Chairman Bill Byrne learned the hard way about Fulton Commission Chairman Mitch Skandalakis . <p> My neighbors and I have been trying to fight the proposed paving of our road in south Fulton County . At a meeting with the chairman , we were assured that the county had more pressing needs for the money than to pave a road where half the residents do n't want it paved . <p> At a meeting with south Fulton residents , Fulton Commissioner Michael Hightower promised to recommend against paving the road because there were so many unpaved roads where all the residents were in favor of paving . <p> Guess what ? Commissioner Hightower actually recommended the paving , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paving package passed with no opposition . Is it any wonder so many Americans do n't trust their government ? <p> Business in jeopardy ? George and Karen Raburn , Stockbridge <p> Insurance Commissioner John Oxendine is considering imposing a rule change that could affect our workers ' compensation premium . As small- business owners , we are outraged . We have a hard enough time now keeping up with the rates and if they are increased by 15 percent to 30 percent , it may very well put us out of business . <p> This could have an adverse affect on us as small-business owners as well as many others if he follows through with this . <p> ' Green area ' a luxury Corki Feltman , Jonesboro <p> Regarding mandating that developers have pre-designed " green areas " : It would be nice if everything were perfect . However , when a developer buys a piece of land , puts in sewer , curbs , gutters and street lights , this adds 30 to 50 percent to lot costs . Then the builder has to build , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mandated septic tanks , every house would be another $ 20,000 to begin with . Where would all our first-time buyers ever be able to purchase , not to mention families on a budget ? In Clayton and Henry Counties we do care , and builders and developers are very careful to leave as many trees as possible . But reality has to creep in here sometime . <p> The writer is a real estate agent . Will church cop out ? Jan S. Monningh , Locust Grove <p> Thank you for your editorial " Cooke-ing the books " ( May 6 ) dealing with the alleged embezzlement of $ 2.2 million by Ellen Cooke , the treasurer at the Episcopal Church 's national offices . <p> Many Episcopalians , especially those of us who are members of Episcopalian United , a conservative reform group within the church , are watching closely to see what Presiding Bishop Edmund Browning will do in this matter . One should note that Cooke 's excuses seem carefully prepared to include some " buzz words " near and dear to the liberal wing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears to have been drafted by someone in the radical feminist element of the liberal wing , e.g. , her actions were caused by male oppressors in the church hierarchy . This is ironic , to say the least , when one considers the leftward lurches the church has made under Browning 's leadership . <p> During recent years , worthwhile programs were eliminated and jobs were lost at the national church level due to lack of funds . Perhaps the missing $ 2.2 million could have saved some of them . If the presiding bishop does not take forceful action in this matter , the consequences will be very , very serious . <p> The writer is president of the Atlanta chapter of Episcopalians United . <p> Who matters more ? Willis LeMon , Fayetteville There is a double standard in this country that is pathetic . <p> If you are an unmarried woman with tons of illegitimate children and sucking on the breast of welfare , you are entitled to the best medicine on the shelves for free . <p> However , if you served in the armed forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when you reach the age of 65 , you are taken off of Champus Healthcare and forced onto Medicare . Then you have $ 46 a month taken from your Social Security check that you worked almost 50 years for and you are not entitled to prescription medicine unless you pay for it . <p> So I guess it comes down to a simple fact : Do n't do anything and you get everything , but work hard all your life and get next to nothing . <p> Braves deserved rout Bob Browne , Peachtree City <p> Hey , Bobby , how about slapping around some of those prima donna , one- dimensional players for a change ? The Braves ' brutalizing at the hands of the budget-payrolled Phillies , a real baseball team , was well deserved . <p> One gets the feeling that they actually work on skills and strategies , which the local team is pathetically unprepared for and is loathe to employ . Can you imagine Atlanta 's right fielder soiling his jersey with a headlong slide to set up the winning run ? Remember the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players had a team mentality instead of an abiding pursuit of individual statistics ? <p> Hey , Bobby , do you recall a time when managers managed aggressively and courageously ? Oh , well , since I 'm not following my ex-favorite sport anymore , what the heck . The gross abuse of fans by owners and players in the futile strike leaves me empty of caring . <p> But , if I did care anymore , it would seem obvious that for the mega- payroll Atlanta fans are subsidizing , they deserve a team playing real ball . Don'cha think , Bobby ?
