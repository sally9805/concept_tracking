Section : BUSINESS For a rising number of professionals , the dream of financial security is gone <p> They all had a dream , once upon a time . It went something like this : good grades , the right schools , perhaps even an M.B.A . Then , after a few hard years of 12-hour days and total loyalty to the company , they would get the big prize  --  a hefty salary leading someday to a comfortable retirement . Now that dream of job security is like so many other youthful fantasies , just a memory . It has been replaced by job anxiety , a scary new vision filled with euphemisms like restructuring , down-sizing and streamlining . Even respected members of once stable professions  --  banking , insurance , the law  --  have felt the ax . <p> In the old days , a pink slip would n't have been such a big deal for white-collar workers , many of whom have undergraduate and graduate degrees in technical areas . But with whole industries shrinking in a declining economy , even highly skilled professionals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their field . They may spend months looking for work and then have to settle for something far below their previous jobs . Many of the victims of this recession are middle managers , often people in their 30s and early 40s . This was supposed to be the prime of their lives , their peak earning years . Instead , they find themselves weighted down by mortgages , young families , big bills and an increasingly uncertain future . Dan Lacey , editor of the newsletter Workplace Trends , estimates that 70 percent of this year 's newly jobless will be white-collar workers . " It totals up to nearly 250,000 families who used to believe in lifetime job security , " says Lacey . " These are the economic icon jobs . They are the Ozzie-and-Harriet jobs , the jobs that gave us the ability to buy a house in a nice neighborhood and drive two cars . They are the jobs that have made the American lifestyle possible . " When that dream dies , everyone grieves . Myles O'Dwyer , a 38-year-old former chief financial officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last May when his firm went on a cost-cutting campaign . Six months later he 's still out of work . " It 's a terrible blow to your self-confidence , " O'Dwyer says . " You feel worth less . " With a wife and two young daughters to support , he 's willing to look et positions that are a step down on the career ladder . His wife has suffered , too , he says . " When my wife has been on a high , I have been on a low and when she 's been low , I 've been feeling good . Each of us has had severe emotional depths to wade through . " His daughters do n't understand why Daddy does n't go to the office anymore . " We went to Disneyland a few weeks ago and there was a wishing well that we threw our pennies into , " he recalls . " My wife asked me what I wished for and I said , ' A new job , ' and my daughter said , ' You ca n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . " <p> Blue collar workers are more used to weathering such storms . In many industries , such as automobiles or steel , layoffs have come to be a part of the economic cycle . " That 's the bump and grind of their life , " says Margaret Morley , executive director of the Beacon Therapeutic Diagnostic and Treatment Center in Chicago . " The white-collar worker does n't expect the bump and grind . It 's an unusual assault . " Professionals and managers also tend to have more of their identity tied up in the work . " If you ask somebody in a blue-collar job what he does , he 'll say , ' I work at the plant or the factory ' , " says Neil P. Lewis , a management psychologist in Atlanta who counsels businesses . " But if you ask a white-collar person , he 'll say , ' I 'm an accountant or a marketing person or a journalist .

She thinks she would be a great asset to any company planning to expand into Eastern Europe . But after nearly a year of joblessness , she 's deeply discouraged . " I know the homeless have it worse than we do , " she says . " The people with AIDS have it worse than we do . But what am I supposed to do ? I 'm 40 years old . Am I supposed to retire for the next 40 years ? " <p> Bleak letter : Although some people see the warning signs , many are stunned to find themselves suddenly among the ranks of the jobless . Rich Briede worked for Donaldson , Lufkin &; Jenrette , Inc. at the Midwest Stock Exchange in Chicago until last week . He found out he had lost his job when he received a certified letter on a Saturday informing him that his company was dropping his insurance coverage . The pink slip seems particularly unreal to employees who have felt successful and appreciated at work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketing manager at Sara Lee Bakery in Deerfield , Ill. , on Oct. 4 when the company eliminated her department . Three weeks earlier she had had her annual review and received the highest possible raise in her level . When the boss called her in and told her she was losing her job , she started laughing . " I thought he was joking , " she says . He was n't . " My boss said , ' Please . Stop laughing ' . " <p> Verma is n't laughing anymore . Like many of the newly unemployed , she went through a series of emotional stages that resemble common reactions to death and divorce  --  the two traumas psychologists say most closely resemble firing . After shock comes anger and grief and then finally an acceptance of the inevitable . " Some people go through it all in two days , " says Lewis , the Atlanta psychologist . " Others take weeks and months . I think six to 12 hours of self-pity is OK , but after that you need to get on with it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a surge in membership of groups catering to dismissed workers . Forty Plus , a nationwide organization that specializes in job hunters 40 years of age and older , features a " job jury , " where job hunters have their resume critiqued by their peers . Church groups around the country have taken on the unemployed as a new ministry , offering emotional support , job-hunting assistance and personal-finance tips . Even state governments are getting into the act . California 's Employment Development Department has a special program for white-collar managers and projects aimed at two major industries : aerospace and electronics . The programs offer moral support as well as practical advice . <p> As time passes and the severance pay runs out , families are forced to make drastic revisions in long-held life plans . David Johnson , 30 , earned more than $100,000 as a Wall Street mutual-fund manager . When he was fired in late January , his wife , Cindy , 30 , was on maternity leave from her job as a buyer at Bloomingdale 's in Manhattan . Their son , Zachary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping to put off her return to full-time work to be home more with the baby . Instead , David has found himself playing Mr. Mom while Cindy has gone back to work full time at a Bloomingdale 's branch near their New Jersey home . David has had a number of promising interviews , but he 's given up speculating about how long his search will take . Instead , he tries to concentrate on the positive : time with his son . " It 's probably what has kept my spirits up , " he says . " I see it as an opportunity to get to know him . " They 're living on savings ; Cindy 's salary covers no more than half of their monthly expenses , David says . Cindy sees their life as being in a kind of " holding pattern " and concedes that there have been moments of tension between them . " It 's what we do n't say to each other " in an effort to minimize strain , she says . " It 's very stressful . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotional balance . Although some couples , like the Johnsons , say they are stronger for the experience , others find the mental strain is even worse than the financial strain . People who have lost jobs may be more susceptible to alcohol and drug abuse , says Stephen Pilster-Pearson , director of employee assistance at the University of Wisconsin at Madison . Feelings of anger and betrayal may lead to family violence or divorce . " Those feelings have to go somewhere , " says Pilster-Pearson , " and one of those places , of course , is home . " Couples may find themselves fighting over seemingly small issues and saying more than they mean to . Comments like " My mother said I should never have married you and she was right " represent deep frustration over a situation that seems out of control . " All those unresolved issues that have been sort of pushed aside get let loose because there 's nothing co hold them back anymore , " Pilster-Pearson says . <p> Even those still on the job are not immune to anxiety and stress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consulting firm , found that fewer than 24 percent of 11,000 workers surveyed expressed confidence in the long-term future of their jobs Employee paranoia is sometimes carried to extremes . Some middle managers at one particularly beleaguered Wall Street brokerage firm are so fearful of losing their jobs that they arrange to be out of the office on Friday , the day on which they believe they are most likely to get the ax . " They think that if they are n't around , they might be able to dodge the pink slip for a while . " says one consultant . Other anxious executives try to seek out advance warning . William Morin , chairman of Drake Beam Morin , an outplacement firm , says he gets as many as 10 calls a week from friends who want to know if they have been singled out to be canned . " They constantly ask , ' Am I on the list , Bill ? ' I 've never seen anything like it during all the years I 've been in business . " <p> Fear is n't the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel guilty receiving a paycheck while their friends and ex-colleagues are down at the unemployment office . There 's a feeling of " Why them and not me ? " They also probably have to work even harder now that there are fewer people to share the load . All these issues demand special sensitivity from top management , says Joel Brockner of Columbia University 's graduate school of business Brockner , who has studied survivors ' reactions , says managers should be careful to explain the economic reasons behind the layoffs . " We can accept things better when we understand why they occurred , " he says . They should make sure that dismissals are handled " with dignity " and not callously . After the layoffs , they should emphasize the positive aspects of a newly streamlined organization : more opportunity for those still on board , new career paths , less bureaucracy and greater efficiency . It 's also important for managers to " play it straight , " Brockner says . If an employee asks about the possibility of future layoffs , " you can say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't say for sure . It depends on how things go ' . " <p> Even with the best of management , there 's no easy way to bridge the gap left by breaking a crucial clause in the unspoken contract between employee and employer . If loyalty and hard work no longer guarantee the payback of security , why should workers put the company 's interests before their own ? John Fetcho was let go with one day 's notice last March after working more than a decade at a Chicago-area insurance brokerage firm . Although he managed to find another job in only three months , Fetcho , 33 , learned an important lesson : never count on an employer . " I make a point of interviewing every couple of months , " he says , " more to keep my hand in it so it pushes me to keep a resume updated and my interview skills . " He has gained a new understanding of economic realities . " Unless you work for yourself , you 're always subject to the whims of the people who employ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a publicly held company , then it 's the bottom line " that counts , not years of dedicated service . <p> This newfound wisdom is one unanticipated benefit of joblessness ; another plus is an unexpected opportunity to re-evaluate . Some white-collar workers may view joblessness as an opportunity to change professions and start over in a new direction at midlife . " People do n't look at alternatives until they are forced to , " says Laura Wada who was fired in June from her $30,000-a year administrative job after 11 years at GTE in Mountain View , Calif . " There is no time to re-evaluate your life when you 're on the treadmill . " At 40 , she is planning to switch careers and is looking for a Job in human resources after taking courses in the subject . " In the ' 90s , " she says , " people have to learn to be more flexible . " <p> As in most economic upheavals , there 's always someone who profits .

" We may be turning out corporate America 's lights , " said William Morin . But even he strikes a cautionary note . " If we ca n't find people jobs , we could be the last ones out the door . " No one is safe anymore . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : ADVERTISING <p> Lynne Scanton , the head of two advertising publications , got the word from her boss to beef up her staff . She did .

When the boss told her , she thought he was joking . <p> By BARBARA KANTROWITZ ANNETTA MILLER in New York , KAREN SPRINGEN in Chicago , RITA PYRILLIS in Los Angeles and bureau reports <p> WARNING SIGNS <p> Along with an overall slump in your industry or region , here are some other indications your job may be in danger . Your company has high debt , but low cash flow . Management has already tried an early-retirement buyout and a hiring freeze . You notice fewer ads for your company 's products . Your firm merges with another that duplicates your work . Your boss has gotten the ax , or your boss 's boss . <p> CARTOON <p> LEARNING FROM THE BLUE-COLLAR BLUES <p> During the last recession in the early ' 80s , Chicago bureau chief John McCormick talked to dozens of laid-off blue-collar workers for the 1983 cover story " Left Out . " Last week he asked several of those workers what advice they have for today 's jobless : <p> You might not think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pity on laid-off lawyers . But he does . " I know what it 's like when your supposedly secure industry falls apart , " he says . " We 're still digging ourselves out of the hole . " In the depths of a two-year layoff , Tardio gave his house back to the bank and moved his family in with his mother . Today Big Steel 's leaner wage scale keeps his pay near $30,000  --  about what it was a decade ago . His main advice for the new unemployed : do n't choke . " Job or no job , you wo n't dry up and blow away . I honestly had to learn that we were n't all going to die . " <p> Many victims of the rustbelt recession had to find entirely new careers . Kelli Schneiker of South Milwaukee , Wis. , once stood in line with 20,000 other applicants for 200 advertised factory jobs at the A.O. Smith Corp . Today , after years of retraining , he 's a well-paid electrician at a utility company . " I tell my kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says . " When times turn tough you need marketable skills . " Others found the courage to go into business for themselves . Ted Hosea of Flint , Mich. , sold two boats and spent his $37,000 buyout from General Motors to open Hit-N-run Billiards . " I made $27,000 last year , which is about what I earned at GM , " Hosea says . " The difference is that now I 've got a business worth $150,000 . " <p> Lean times : Years of scarcity have convinced many that in today 's economy , no job is secure forever . Don Brooks is i back at work on the Mesabi Iron Range of northern Minnesota after four years of intermittent layoffs . During the lean times , Brooks kept food on his family 's table by driving long distances for construction work . " You ca n't outlive the threat that your industry may nose-dive , " he says . " That door can close any day . " <p> The mood on the factory floor is hardly smug : even in this recession , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Massachusetts economist Michael Podgursky says that in the early 1980s , the average white-collar victim went jobless for only 16 weeks , and went back to work at 92 percent of his old pay . For bluecollar workers , it was 30 weeks and 86 percent of the old paycheck . " Five years from now most of today 's white-collar jobless will be back on their feet with similar incomes , " Podgursky says . go-go fields such as real estate or investment may be an exception . " It 's important for them not to fixate on their go-go years , " he says . " Everyone knew those salaries could n't be sustained . " <p> Though painful , layoffs can sometimes bring welcome epiphanies . Seven years ago Jimmy Thomas of Rockford , Ill. , was so broke he had his youthful-looking wife , Donna , tell bill collectors that , sorry , her parents were n't home . Economic strains grew so great that the Thomases divorced . In time , though , they reunited . Today they juggle four jobs and earn $23,000 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a warehouse . Their five children , says Donna , are richer for the struggle : " Without the problems they 'd have been better off in a material way . But they 'd have missed the pitfalls that teach you how to live . " After years of internal anguish , Jimmy Thomas has learned the most valuable lesson of all . " People crash when they ca n't maintain the lifestyle they think they want , " he says . " You only need to worry about food and shelter . The rest is truly irrelevant . " <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Jimmy Thomas was laid off his job as a warehouse worker in the early 80 's . Now he and his wife , Donna , have four part-time jobs between them . But they say they are better off for the struggle . <p> SEARCHING LONGER <p> As the economy worsens , workers who get laid off are finding that it takes more and more to find another job . <p> Last month it took an average of 12 weeks for a jobless worker to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took at the same time last year . <p> But managerial and professional workers tend to be out of work even longer  --  by two or more weeks . <p> SOURCE : BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS <p>
