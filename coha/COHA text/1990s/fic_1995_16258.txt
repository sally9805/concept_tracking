He is dressed exactly the same as when we last saw him , complete with beret . He struggles groggily into his socks and boots . The entire apartment is in disarray . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did he ask you ? &nbsp; WANDAYesterday , when I was helping him check into his hotel . &nbsp; WOLFWhat , the guy ca n't even check into a hotel by himself ? &nbsp; WANDAListen , Wolf , having Chad Palomino in this movie will benefit us all .

As the Gaffer and Boom man drag off the almost unconscious Palomino , the Scriptgirl takes one faltering step after him . &nbsp; SCRIPT ( sniffling ) Chad . . .

I am not a director . The shoot is over . I give up . Nick 's speech has the simple eloquence of truth ; he is not bitter or self-pitying . He seems unaware of how disturbing this is to the crew . They all stand around him in shock , afraid to move or speak . Finally Wolf turns to the AC and puts his hand on his shoulder , like a father to his young son . &nbsp; WOLFTake the camera off the dolly . Start putting it away .

She circles Nicole with determination , seemingly oblivious to Nick and the rest of the crew hovering behind Wolf as he begins following her with the hand-held camera . Wolf is now in his element ; gliding like Nureyev with the camera . When he pans suddenly with Cora the whole crew ducks wildly and dives out of camera range . Cora finally stops circling Nicole and stops abruptly . Suddenly she raises the apple right out in front of Nicole . Wolf glides forward with the camera , framing an amazing CU of the apple with Nicole seen behind it . Nicole reaches out , grabs the apple and takes a huge , resounding bite out of it . CU Nick 's face , eyes wide in anxious delight . Cora takes one step forward . CU her fuzzy slippers stopping right on the yellow tape mark .

The set grows suddenly quiet as Nick begins pacing rapidly , muttering to himself .  --  134  --  &nbsp; NICKCan I use it for the Dream Sequence , that 's the question . Does it work for the Dream Sequence ? Nick suddenly looks up and sees everybody staring at him ; Nicole in her wedding gown , Wolf with his eyepatch , his mother still eating the apple , Wanda , the crew . &nbsp; NICKWe 're going with it , Wanda ! &nbsp; WANDAAlright everyone , listen up .
