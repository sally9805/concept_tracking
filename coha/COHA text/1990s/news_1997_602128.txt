<p> Two weeks into the season , and fantasy owners can spot the trends . The Chargers and Seahawks are not your best bets for point production . How long will Drew Bledsoe stay hot ? Next up for his Patriots , the New York Jets . The tips on this page should confirm what you already knew . <p> Produced by Jack Pullman of All Pro Publishing . For more information on his newsletter , call 805-379-5171 or visit the website at **27;1493;TOOLONG <p> ARIZONA ( 1-1 ) <p> Kent Graham makes his share of mistakes ( fumbles ) , but his yardage is good and the TDs are adequate . Both WRs , Rob Moore and Frank Sanders , are viable . Though he 's not part of the goal-line package , Leeland McElroy , who has two TDRs , should produce here as Washington 's D continues to yield plenty of rushing yards , just as it did last year ( worst in the league ) . <p> Up next at Washington <p> ATLANTA ( 0-2 ) <p> Those of you who had Game 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chandler get knocked out ? " pool may cash in your tickets . A concussion did him in Sunday , leaving Billy Joe Tolliver in charge . ( Yikes ! ) The O had all of 7 yards in the fourth quarter . This offense is better with Chandler at the helm . ( Check his status . ) <p> Up next Oakland <p> BALTIMORE ( 1-1 ) <p> There 's still no featured back as Earnest Byner and rookie Jay Graham shared the job . Graham is enticing , though Bam Morris ' unsure status ( out at least two more games ) makes this tricky . As expected , Derrick Alexander had a big day after playing third fiddle last week . Jermaine Lewis ( knee ) was unable to play . <p> Up next at New York Giants <p> BUFFALO ( 1-1 ) <p> We would n't have known it based on preseason play , but Todd Collins , Andre Reed and Jay Riemersma are among the leaders at their respective positions . FB Tim Tindale 's 105 receiving yards was terrific , but also a fluke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Early is batting 1.000 with one touchdown on his only catch . <p> Up next at Kansas City <p> CAROLINA ( 1-1 ) <p> Steve Beuerlein is a detriment at QB . The O has only one TD in games vs . Washington and Atlanta . There 's a chance Kerry Collins could be back this week ; however , it 's a long shot . Anthony Johnson and Wesley Walls are producing , as is John Kasay . <p> Up next at San Diego <p> CHICAGO ( 0-2 ) <p> Erik Kramer has been steady with TDPs to his starting WRs . The surprises have been Ricky Proehl ( two TDs ) and Raymont Harris . Look for ex-FB Harris to either line up at HB with Tony Carter at FB or alone in a one-back set . The Bears had five TDPs in two games vs . Detroit last year . <p> Up next Detroit <p> CINCINNATI ( 1-1 ) <p> The yardage was there , but after an early Jeff Blake-Carl Pickens TD , the team settled for four FGAs . ( Doug Pelfrey made only one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Up next Bye week <p> DALLAS ( 1-1 ) <p> It looked like retro night as Dallas managed solid yardage but settled for FGAs and no offensive TDs . Troy Aikman looked sharp at times but could n't make the key play . After peaking against Green Bay , look for Philadelphia 's D to be softer here . Emmitt Smith , who feasts on the Philadelphia defense , had three TDRs vs. the Eagles last year . <p> Up next Philadelphia <p> DENVER ( 2-0 ) <p> John Elway had his first two TDPs , both to Ed McCaffrey , a bargain player who does n't get the publicity of Shannon Sharpe or even Rod Smith . He could be worth picking up if you need a WR . <p> Up next St. Louis <p> DETROIT ( 1-1 ) <p> For the most part , this offense has not played well . Thanks to a few big plays , however , the stats are better than the performances would indicate . Barry Sanders has had trouble finding operating room in the offense . Do n't be surprised if he gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news is the fact that Scott Mitchell had four TDPs and a TDR vs . Chicago at home last year . <p> Up next at Chicago <p> GREEN BAY ( 1-1 ) <p> It was very bizarre Sunday as this O racked up almost 400 gross yards but could n't cross the goal line . The team used a lot of 3-WR sets , making Derrick Mayes an almost-starter . Dorsey Levens continues to run well , though his receiving has been weak . Ryan Longwell has made six FGs so far , but his one miss is the one that he 'll be hearing about . <p> Up next Miami <p> INDIANAPOLIS ( 0-2 ) <p> Well , this offense is consistent , producing the same number of TDs in each game  --  zero ! Largely , the OL remains the culprit . When Jim Harbaugh was n't being dropped ( five sacks ) , he was throwing quick , short passes . Help is on the way . Seattle 's D has allowed eight TDs and almost 400 yards a game . Do n't give up on Marshall Faulk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seattle <p> JACKSONVILLE ( 2-0 ) <p> Fill-in QB Steve Matthews did n't score but the O did n't miss a beat  --  375 yards and 40 points . Rob Johnson likely will <p> take over after this week 's bye , and No. 1 QB Mark Brunell likely will return a week or two later . Though Natrone Means has three TDs , it 's too early to write off James Stewart , the " junior partner . " <p> Up next Bye week <p> KANSAS CITY ( 0-1 ) <p> Going into Monday 's game , this O still was looking to settle in . Getting accustomed to a new team might take time for the QB and receivers , though there 's enough talent to produce soon . Andre Rison has been a model citizen thus far while Brett Perriman is returning ( hamstring ) . Buffalo 's pass D is suspect . <p> Up next Buffalo <p> MIAMI ( 2-0 ) <p> Dan Marino responded to his critics with 324 yards  --  but no TDPs for his fantasy owners . The star here has been K Olinda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Irving Spikes had the TD . FB Stanley Pritchett , a fine blocker and decent receiver , will be out 2-3 months after surgery on a dislocated kneecap . <p> Up next at Green Bay <p> MINNESOTA ( 2-0 ) <p> This O is looking good , especially for yardage . It tallied only two TDs with its four FGAs . Jake Reed and Cris Carter totaled 21 catches and 225 yards  --  though only one TD ( Reed ) . Chris Walsh scored on his only reception , the game winner . Add Robert Smith 's running , and this is a balanced attack . <p> Up next Tampa Bay <p> NEW ENGLAND ( 2-0 ) <p> The hits keep on coming as Drew Bledsoe had his second four-spot  --  to four different players . Ironically , three who had a TDC in the first game had no receptions Sunday . FBs Sam Gash and Keith Byars were shut out while Terry Glenn did not play ( ankle ) . Likely , he 'll return this week . Curtis Martin and Ben Coates scored in each game vs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York Jets <p> NEW ORLEANS ( 0-2 ) <p> This O is in trouble . It 's not the only one with only one TD after two games , but it seems that it could maintain that pace for quite a while  --  especially this week as San Franciso 's D is on the same schedule ( one TD in two games ) . Rookie RB Troy Davis got his first start Sunday . <p> Up next at San Francisco <p> N.Y . GIANTS ( 1-1 ) <p> This O cooled off some after a fast start , though Dave Brown did throw a TDP for the second consecutive game . Chris Calloway has found new life as the go-to receiver , at least for now . Ike Hilliard injured his neck and is being examined . Tiki Barber managed a TD , though he struggled much of the day . He suffered a shoulder injury . ( Check status . ) Baltimore 's pass defense is very weak . <p> Up next Baltimore <p> N.Y . JETS ( 1-1 ) <p> The Jets O was returned to Earth by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards ) , and Neil O'Donnell was sacked eight times on his way to 218 yards and a TDP . New England 's D has been very tough across the board . With five FGs , John Hall has been a pleasant surprise . <p> Up next at New England <p> OAKLAND ( 0-1 ) <p> Going into Monday 's game , this O had functioned on only one cylinder : Jeff George-to-Tim Brown connection . TE Rickey Dudley appears to be the No. 2 target , ahead of WRs James Jett and Kenny Shedd . Atlanta 's D has been a surprise  --  only two TDs in as many games . <p> Up next at Atlanta <p> PHILADELPHIA ( 1-1 ) <p> The O was weak against a tough Packers D and it wo n't be easy here  --  at Dallas . Ty Detmer has returned to last year 's spotty form . He has his moments  --  mostly when he looks for Irving Fryar . If Deion Sanders goes man-to-man coverage on Fryar , Michael Timpson will get plenty of action . Ricky Watters will face a tough Cowboys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each produced in Dallas last year . <p> Up next at Dallas <p> PITTSBURGH ( 1-1 ) <p> QB Kordell Stewart continues to disappoint . His passing has been awful , though his rushing skills make him a better fantasy player  --  while taking away from Jerome Bettis ' goal-line action . <p> Up next Bye week <p> ST . LOUIS ( 1-1 ) <p> Tony Banks had an off day with only 123 yards and three fumbles . Isaac Bruce ( hamstring ) , who missed his second game in a row , is sorely missed by both Banks and Eddie Kennison , who seems more comfortable as the No. 2 wideout . Lawrence Phillips remains solid , though he was cooled off by San Francisco . Kevin Lee could get a lot of action as St. Louis figures to frequently be in passing situations . <p> Up next at Denver <p> SAN DIEGO ( 1-1 ) <p> With Stan Humphries unable to play ( left shoulder ) , Jim Everett took over . The O was just adequate against a weak Saints D , totaling only 229 yards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left early ( hamstring ) . He 's a key to the attack . Eric Metcalf finally contributed to the O , though rookie TE Freddie Jones has both TDs . <p> Up next Carolina <p> SAN FRANCISCO ( 1-1 ) <p> With Steve Young and Jeff Brohm ailing , rookie Jim Druckenmiller got the call and . . . did n't get injured . He did have a TDP , though his 103 yards and three INTs were n't very impressive . His tenure as starting QB will depend upon the status of Young ( concussion ) and Brohm ( hand ) . If Young plays , it bodes well for WRs Terrell Owens and J.J. Stokes . If not , vet TE Brent Jones gets more action to help the inexperienced QB . <p> Up next New Orleans <p> SEATTLE ( 0-2 ) <p> Warren Moon 's Seahawks debut was so-so : 222 yards and a TDP . This O has only one TD and one FG so far . The running game is yet to get going . Look for the O to get a jump start from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Up next at Indianapolis <p> TAMPA BAY ( 2-0 ) <p> The good news is that Trent Dilfer has a TDP in each game . The problem is that not many people were using the two backup TEs who had the TD catches . The story is at RB , where Warrick Dunn got the ball ( 24 carries ) and delivered ( 130 yards and a TDR ) . The team does n't want to make him a workhorse runner . The small , speedster will share the load with Mike Alstott , the dependable , plodder type . <p> Up next at Minnesota <p> TENNESSEE ( 1-1 ) <p> Steve McNair continues to struggle as a passer but raises his fantasy value with his rushing skills . The receiving corps is weak with Chris Sanders the only legitimate WR . RB Eddie George is a premier talent on a so-so O. <p> Up next Bye week <p> WASHINGTON ( 1-1 ) <p> This O managed 354 gross yards but could n't cross the goal line . Gus Frerotte passed for 270 yards but had only three INTs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WR . Top RB Terry Allen sidelined with broken thumb but should be ready and would prosper against the Cardinals poor run D. <p> Up next Arizona <p> The hot and cold players <p> WHO 'S HOT <p> QB Drew Bledsoe , Patriots  --  League-best 607 yards passing and eight touchdowns . Zero interceptions . <p> RB Eddie George , Oilers  --  322 yards rushing and a 5.6-yard-per-carry average and two touchdowns . <p> RB Terrell Davis , Broncos  --  47 carries for 208 yards and two touchdowns . <p> WR Tim Brown , Raiders  --  19 catches for 313 yards and two touchdowns . <p> WR Cris Carter , Vikings  --  Averaging 13.4 yards a catch . 228 yards receiving and two touchdowns . <p> WR Jimmy Smith , Jaguars  --  223 yards receiving on 14 catches and two touchdowns . <p> P Tom Tupa , Patriots  --  League-best 53.7-yard average , 5 yards better than nearest competitor . <p> K Jason Elam , Broncos  --  Six-for-six in field goal attempts , including a 53-yarder . Has made all four of his PAT tries . <p> WHO 'S NOT <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( .467 ) attempts with two interceptions and one passing touchdown . <p> QB Heath Shuler , Saints  --  Completed 28 of 59 ( .475 ) attempts with five interceptions and 0 touchdowns . <p> QB Gus Frerotte , Redskins  --  Completed 29 of 62 attempts ( .468 ) for 417 yards , with three interceptions and one touchdown pass . <p> RB Thurman Thomas , Bills  --  81 yards rushing on 26 carries and one touchdown . <p> RB Barry Sanders , Lions  --  53 yards rushing on 25 carries . More than a third of his 180 total yards came on a 66-yard TD reception vs . Tampa Bay . <p> RB Charlie Garner , Eagles  --  Seven carries and 30 yards while playing behind Ricky Watters . <p> WR Terance Mathis , Falcons  --  Four catches for 64 yards and 0 touchdowns . <p> Monday 's picks to click <p> Philadelphia : WR Michael Timpson <p> Dallas : TE Eric Bjornson <p> Not so sure hands <p> Players who fumbled on the highest percentage of touches last year , minimum of 100 touches ( touches include rush attempts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wheatley 124 5 4.03 Leonard Russell 232 6 2.59 LeShon Johnson 156 4 2.56 Mike Alstott 161 4 2.48 Lamar Smith 162 4 2.47 Mario Bates 177 4 2.26 Leroy Hoard 136 3 2.21 Harvey Williams 143 3 2.10 <p> Ca n't hold me down <p> Running backs who last year broke the most tackles ( minimum of 100 combined rushes/receptions ) : Broken Player Rush/Catch tackles Pct .
