<p> Pat Schroeder , Al Knight joust over arsenic issue <p> Al Knight would have your readers believe ( " Pat Schroeder is slipping , " Post , Aug. 13 ) that my alarm over Republican efforts to prohibit the EPA from issuing new standards on arsenic in drinking water was " desperate demagoguery . " <p> Knight said that " Arsenic is not a significant threat in most public water supplies and it is already monitored and regulated by federal law . " First , Knight concedes arsenic in our drinking water is a threat ; we can quibble over how significant it is . Boy , that 's reassuring . But his second point is absurd . The issue that drew my ire was a move to prohibit the government from monitoring and regulating standards on the allowable level of arsenic in our drinking water . <p> As for what kind of threat arsenic presents , both the U.S. Public Health Service and the National Academy of Sciences have concluded that there is extensive evidence of health threats from the current allowable standard on arsenic in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a risk of more than one cancer per 100 people who are exposed to arsenic . <p> The EPA has proposed strengthening the standard to 10 parts per billion from the current 50 parts per billion . In other words , the EPA is doing its job monitoring and regulating . But the Republican-controlled House does n't want EPA to do its job . <p> The Republican majority wrote language into an EPA appropriations measure prohibiting the EPA from strengthening standards on arsenic , not to mention a host of other toxic substances such as lead and dioxins . I opposed that prohibition and voted for the Stokes amendment , which would have removed it from the bill . The issue was hotly contested . Initially , the Stokes amendment passed 212-206 . Three days later , the Republican leadership , led by House Speaker Newt Gingrich , organized a repeat vote , and the Stokes amendment failed , 210-210 . <p> A related amendment , proposed by a bipartisan coalition of two Democrats and two Republicans , would have struck from the bill any provision that restricted the EPA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , benzene , dioxin , lead or any known carcinogen . " Amazingly , that amendment was defeated , 188-228 . The Republican majority in the House voted 6 to 1 against the amendment . ( All four Colorado Republicans voted no on this . ) <p> Knight would have your readers believe that this is all no big deal , that the Public Health Service does n't know what it is talking about , and that it 's more economical to run the increased risk of cancer from arsenic than to clean up our water . He may sincerely believe that . But it 's not " desperate demagoguery " to prefer cleaner water . <p> PATRICIA SCHROEDER <p> U.S. Representative , Denver <p> ( Editor 's note : Knight replies that Representative Schroeder plainly told a radio audience that Republicans " wanted to put arsenic " in public water supplies . Knight 's column pointed out that arsenic is already regulated and that the Republican Party has never voted to end that practice or otherwise increase health risks posed by arsenic . ) <p> Children work in slavery around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information on the plight of children working in factories worldwide ( " Child slavery : Millions of Asian kids caught in long , cruel labor , " Sept. 19 ) . We should all be aware when we purchase goods , including clothing , shoes , carpets , children 's toys and jewelry , imported from countries such as India , Pakistan , the Philippines , Indonesia , Mexico and Guatemala , that those items may have been produced by children . The International Labor Organization estimates that there are 200 million children under the age of 15 employed around the globe . <p> Working conditions for these children are deplorable . <p> Children working in leather-tanning factories in Colombia are burned , exposed to toxic chemicals and lose their fingers working with machines without safety latches . Children working in dark and damp carpet factories in India suffer from vision loss , respiratory illness , deformed backs and scabies . Children in China , Egypt and Lesotho spend 12 hours a day at sewing machines for wages of as little as $ 8 a month . <p> As consumers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without questioning the policies of the companies that import them . Until recently there has been little that we could do . However , initiatives are being developed to label products as child-labor free . The RUGMARK Foundation has begun inspecting and certifying Indian carpet factories and labeling certain carpets as child-labor free . If successful , this labeling system can become a model for other industries such as clothing and leather goods . <p> CARY KENNEDY <p> Denver <p> Let government pay its own expenses <p> Taxpayer money is being spent inappropriately in defending government managers accused of committed sexual harassment , racial intimidation and other abuses . <p> These government managers do not have to defend themselves with their own money but are using the government 's . The defendants have an infinite amount of resources by using the Department of Justice , while those who file against the government have to pay out of their own pockets . The unending stream of defense from the Justice Department leads to abuse of power against the citizens of the United States . <p> I know of a particular case that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. Geological Survey who went to court to file an injunction against her superiors for violating a contract she had signed . The case went to court and the judge got the parties to agree to a settlement hearing . The employee had to hire a lawyer , while the Geological Survey was able to use lawyers from the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney 's Office . <p> The government should be required to budget its legal defense costs just as private citizens have to do . <p> HOWARD FISCHER <p> Boulder <p> Museum 's sale of ivory was distressing <p> I read with interest Steven Rosen 's recent article on the Denver Art Museum 's Saturday auction . I have been a member of the museum for years and wish its staff and friends success . But I was distressed to see an entire display case at the preview holding objects carved from elephant ivory . <p> The African elephant has been greatly reduced in numbers due to poaching for ivory . The U.S. and other nations , pursuant to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspend the international ivory trade in order to reduce pressure on these wonderful animals . <p> While I imagine that the Denver Art Museum was within its legal rights in auctioning the ivory , it certainly showed insensitivity to the elephants and those who are trying to protect them . Selling ivory only encourages those who would circumvent the ban on trade , and contributes to the demand that supports poachers and illegal traders . <p> J. DONALD HUGHES , Professor of History <p> University of Denver <p> Tell the taxpayers why <p> road users should pay <p> the costs of Amtrak <p> Amtrak is making an all-out effort to have its annual subsidy paid for by the highway users of this country . <p> Rob Borella , corporate communications manager , Amtrak , Washington , D.C. , in a recent letter , attacked William Fay of the Highway Users Federation for opposing highway payments to Amtrak . <p> Borella tries to make the case that all forms of transportation are not self-supporting and that user fees cover " less than two-thirds of the cost of building , maintaining and operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Borella asserts , are generated by " property taxes , interest income , and general revenues derived from non-gasoline taxes . " <p> Stay on track , Mr. Borella , and tell me why it 's beneficial to ride Amtrak . If you have " built-in excess capacity , " then why are n't riders filling the seats ? The public is certainly filling the highways , roads and streets we build . <p> PIERRE DUBOIS , Coordinator <p> Colorado Highway Users Conference <p> If labels are to be used , <p> let 's get them correct <p> If I were the two liberal Jefferson County School Board members running for reelection on the union slate , I would demand a retraction of Janet Bingham 's reference to them as moderates . <p> Those folks - Dave DiGiacomo , board president , and Tori Merritts - must have been as shocked as the rest of us were when they were referred to as moderates no less than six times in Bingham 's story , " Major school board races heating up . " They have worked hard for the liberal label @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's and Merritts ' actions are a darned good indicator of their philosophy . They have supported outcome-based education ( a.k.a. standards-based education ) ; they have asked for the union 's support in their reelection bid , and most recently they sided with the union opposing campaign finance reform . I do n't know how they could be confused with any philosophy but liberal . So , if labels are to be used , let 's get them correct . <p> GARY and LINDA BALLARD <p> Golden
