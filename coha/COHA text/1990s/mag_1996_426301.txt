Faced with the agonizing decision to turn in his brother , David Kaczynski did what he had to // THE WHITE POLICE VAN ROLLED to a stop outside the federal courthouse in Helena , Mont. , on April 4 , and out stepped Theodore J. Kaczynski , 53 , dressed in bright orange prison fatigues and surrounded by three marshals . As the media pressed close , the " perp walk " began-the time-honored tradition in which police proudly parade the accused before the press . Most suspects hide their faces , but Kaczynski , the Unabomber suspect who has spent his life shunning the world , held his head high . " Why did you do it ? " shouted one reporter . Kaczynski just smirked , seeming to revel in his moment of glory . Since his arrest on April 3 at his 10by-12-foot plywood shack near Lincoln , Mont. , police have amassed impressive evidence : a live bomb , documents noting the names of Unabomber victims , and notebooks crammed with drawings of devices like the one used by the Unabomber . But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solved , another question remains : How did a brilliant young man with all the advantages-a supportive family , a comfortable childhood , an Ivy League education-become a serial killer ? And how could the same family produce Theodore and his younger brother David , 46-who turned his sibling in to the FBI and is apparently as upstanding as his brother seems twisted ? The two boys grew up in the 1950s in the Chicago suburb of Evergreen Park , III . " The Kaczynskis were warm , intelligent , outgoing-not reclusive at all , " recalls Joyce Johnson , 46 , a neighbor who attended school with David . Theodore Sr. , the father who worked as an engineer and died in 1990 , enjoyed gardening , camping with the boys and playing horseshoes in the backyard with neighbors . Wanda , 78 , his wife , fixed meals for neighbors who were ill , belonged to the local PTA and was , in fact , so concerned about her children 's education that she began a neighborhood preschool .

Bonita Reed , 54 , whose father often tossed horseshoes with Theodore Sr. , recalls that on the few times she visited the Kaczynski home , Ted " was always upstairs by himself or downstairs by himself . He just was n't mixing in the inner family . " There was no question that both boys were highly intelligent .

" But though David was " outgoing and social , " she says , young Ted " would n't talk to you unless you drew him out . " Ted skipped grades 7 and 11 , but something was lacking . " Technically , Teddy was very good , " says Jerome De Runtz , 55 , who was in the high school band with Ted , a trombone player . " But there was a missing quality to his music . He did n't have the feeling . " As for dating , says Russell Mosny , 54 , a o classmate of Ted 's , " he did n't have a girlfriend . Math and physics seemed to be his love .

David , on the other hand , who seemed as intellectual as his brother , also played baseball and basketball , and dated a classmate , Linda Patrik . Little changed for Ted during his college days , first at Harvard , where he graduated in 1962 , then at the University of Michigan , where he earned a master 's in math in 1964 and his Ph.D . in 1967 . Joel Shapiro , 55 , now a math professor at Michigan State University , says he was humbled by his former classmate 's genius for the abstract : " It was as if he could write poetry while the rest of us were struggling to learn grammar . " However , notes Peter Duren , 60 , who had Kaczynski as a student in 1962 , " It was very difficult to carry on a conversation with him if it was n't about mathematics . " When Kaczynski took a job as an assistant professor at the University of California at Berkeley in 1967 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But in a published review of professors , students described his lectures as " useless . " He " refuses to answer questions by completely ignoring the students , " one reviewer wrote . Former colleagues also suggest he may have felt overwhelmed by the political chaos that engulfed Berkeley in the ' ' 60s . Morris Hirsch , 62 , a Berkeley math professor , does not recall Kaczynski taking part in antiwar demonstrations but says many math majors suddenly felt their work had little relevance . " I knew mathematicians who , after a few years , dropped out and joined the Sierra Club or got an MBA , " he says . Some , he adds , " went back to nature . " Kaczynski , who resigned suddenly , chose the latter , rejecting pleas by the department head to reconsider . Eric Hickey , a criminology professor at California State University at Fresno who advised the FBI during its hunt for the Unabomber , sees Kaczynski 's dropping out as a matter of necessity " He 's a man who could n't compete with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came down to any kind of social skills , he did n't have them . " Kaczynski retreated to Montana , where in 1971 , with his brother 's financial help , he bought 1.4 acres of land five miles outside Lincoln and built a small shack . He became a man adrift , living in the late 1970s with his parents in Illinois and working with his brother there in a foam-rubber factory until David , a supervisor , was reportedly forced to fire him for harassment . He then may have briefly lived near Salt Lake City before settling down in his plywood-and-tar-paper sanctuary . Most people in Lincoln viewed him as harmless though unwashed , a recluse who lived off a few hundred dollars a year , read exotic books in foreign languages , spoke only when spoken to , did odd jobs like selling tires in nearby Raynesford for Kibbey Korner Truck Stop , hunted squirrels and rabbits for food , and raised root vegetables . But aside from a reported brief romance in 1978 , it was also in Lincoln that Kaczynski appears to have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is one of them . Three years ago , when a boy at school began mocking him for his grades , Danny was moping on a bridge over the Blackfoot River a half-mile outside Lincoln when the man he came to know as " Uncle Ted " bicycled up beside him . Sherri Wood , 46 , the town librarian who met Kaczynski in 1984 , says he had taken an uncharacteristic interest in Danny . That day , Ted advised him not to worry about the other boy . " He would tell me had a loving dad , a good mom and a good home life , " recalls Danny " And he would say things like , You 're really a smart boy , and right now the kids will be jealous of you . So hang in there , because you are really smart and you do n't want to waste that .

Though Kaczynski never met Juan Sanchez Arreola , 68 , of Chihuahua , he wrote Sanchez about 50 letters from 1988 to 1995 . " I am poorer than ever , but I am in very good health , and that is more important than anything , " he wrote in his last letter to the man he had addressed in previous notes as a " valued friend . " Neither Sanchez nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16 bombings have claimed three lives and left 23 injured since 1978 . " I think Ted came from a heck of a good family who laid a good foundation , " Wood says . " I kept thinking during church , " Oh , Ted , how could you have done this ? You had such great potential . ' " But it was his brother David , following in his older brother 's footsteps , who would develop that potential in a positive way . He too earned an Ivy League degree-at Columbia in 1970-though in English , not math . He also tried his hand in academia and was a success teaching high school English in Lisbon , Iowa , for two years . " Dave really did a lot of extra things with the kids , " says Jim West , a fellow teacher who played in a basketball league with him . " He also enjoyed being one of the guys , hanging out . " Then , in the mid- ' ' 80s , using money he earned driving about six months a year for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , David built his own cabin-this one on a fiveacre parcel near Big Bend National Park in a remote part of West Texas . But unlike Ted , David sought out conversation whenever he rambled into town for supplies . " I never ran into anyone who did n't like David , " recalls Father Mel LaFollette , 65 , a circuit Episcopal priest who met David in 1984 . " He was a person who enjoyed his solitude but also enjoyed being around people . When in a group , he loved to talk .

In 1990 he married Linda Patrik , with whom he had corresponded since high school , and moved to Schenectady , N.Y. , near Union College , where she teaches philosophy . He took a job at Equinox , an Albany halfway house where he helps runaways find housing and counseling . " Dave is a good listener , " says Mary Ann Welch , 49 , who lives next door . " That 's why he does so well working with young boys . It takes a nurturing person to work with those kids , and Dave cares about people . " David joined a local softball league , has published short stories in literary magazines and a few weeks ago brought his mother to live near him . Their father committed suicide in 1990 after learning he had lung cancer , but Ted 's isolation was so complete that he did n't attend the funeral , saying in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not worth a trip . After discovering old letters from Ted that resembled the Unabomber 's treatise printed last September in the Washington Post , David 's suspicions were aroused . But before going to the FBI , he sought the help of private investigator Susan Swanson , a friend of his wife 's , who contacted Clint Van Zandt , a retired member of the FBI 's Behavioral Science Unit . Comparing the writings , he and two teams of analysts found " similarities in theme , construction and word use , " says Van Zandt . Wanda learned of the connection only last month . " She expressed her sincere belief that Ted could not be the Unabomber , " says Anthony P. Bisceglie , a Washington attorney who contacted the FBI for David . " But she also stated that if he were , that he had to be stopped . " Neighbor Bob Welch , 50 , says David and his wife have suffered not only the anguish of having to turn Ted in but also from the media assault that followed .
