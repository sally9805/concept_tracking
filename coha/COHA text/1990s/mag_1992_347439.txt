THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA IS ADDING SOMETHING new to the arguments over the death penalty : the contention that a vote for capital punishment is a vote against home rule . Washington 's homicide rate is down slightly this year . But one of those slain was Tom Barnes , an aide to Alabama Democratic Senator Richard Shelby . The enraged Shelby pushed through Congress a law ordering the District to hold a referendum on reinstating the death penalty , and election officials last week put a sweeping proposal on the Nov. 3 ballot . Nearly all the city 's leading politicians appealed to residents to vote no as a means of expressing resentment against interference in the District 's affairs . Said Eleanor Holmes Norton , the city 's nonvoting delegate to Congress : " This is not about the death penalty . It is about home rule . " But recent savage crimes have aroused such anger that the proposal has a chance of passing .
