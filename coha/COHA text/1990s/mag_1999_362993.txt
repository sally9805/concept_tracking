GOOD NEWS <P> MY HEAD , YOUR ARM Why would anyone take hair from a man 's head and grow it on a woman 's arm ? To advance science  --  and maybe a new treatment for baldness . In a novel experiment , researchers removed patches of a man 's scalp  --  hair , roots and follicles  --  and transplanted them onto the forearm of an unrelated woman . The patches took root and after more than two months showed no signs of rejection . This suggests it may someday be possible to cover bald spots with a full head of hair from someone with hair to spare . <P> WHEN YOU 'RE OLDER With age comes wisdom , maturity ... and a taste for spinach . A study of more than 300 women ages 21 to 84 found that sensitivity to the bitterness in such vegetables as broccoli and spinach wanes with age . The older women preferred sour fruits such as grapefruit and lemons and bitter beverages such as coffee and tea more often than their younger counterparts . So do n't worry if your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually . <P> BAD NEWS <P> TOBACCO , THE GREAT UNEQUALIZER ? Lighting up may be riskier if you 're an older woman . Women over 60 who smoke are more than twice as likely to get lung cancer as same-age males . Why ? Women may be more vulnerable to tobacco 's carcinogens , they may inhale more of these carcinogens with each puff , or they simply may not be screened for lung cancer as vigilantly as men are . <P> GENE BLUES Gene therapy has been going through a rough patch lately . First , a young patient died in the middle of his gene-therapy trial . And last week the Washington Post reported that half a dozen heart patients have died while undergoing a different form of gene therapy . These patients were already desperately ill , however , and it 's not clear that the treatments had anything to do with their death . Gene therapy shows great promise , but anyone who is considering it should know that it 's still very experimental . <P>  --  By Alice Park <P> Sources  --  Good News : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
