Spring skiing means different things at different resorts . At some areas , it just means the lowering of lift-ticket prices as the snow starts to melt . But at many resorts , it means sunshine , parties , great skiing ( not just corn  --  resorts often get powder dumps late in the season ) , uncrowded slopes , and reduced rates on everything from lodging to meals . Most destination resorts offer good deals on complete spring packages in order to lure skiers to the mountains one last time before the snow disappears . In New England , spring rates start to kick in around mid March , while Western resorts , with their longer seasons , do n't usually offer deals until late March or early April . Easter is on April 16 this year , two weeks later than last year , so it probably wo n't affect the timing of spring deals . New Hampshire 's Mount Washington Valley ( 800-367-3364 ) begins significant lodging discounts in March and April , and Wildcat often has skiing into May . The Forest Inn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates by 25 percent at the end of March and 50 percent at the end of April . Attitash ( 800-223-SNOW ) offers Spring Getaway packages beginning March 19 .

Parker 's Motel in Lincoln , near Loon , for example , offers rock-bottom room rates from $34 to $42 per weekend night and $29 per weeknight in March ( $29 any night after April ) . Beginning in late February , after the Presidents ' Week hordes have left , Sugarloaf ( 800-THE-LOAF ) , Maine , lowers its midweek packages to $85 ( pp/do ) per day at the Sugarloaf Inn or a slopeside condo , including lifts , a pass to the Sports and Fitness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down again , to $59 , midweek during the first week in April and any day after April 10 . Considering that a regular-season lift ticket is $43 ( $35 after April 20 ) , spring skiers can reap significant savings . Archrival Sunday River ( 800-543-2SKI ) packages lift tickets and lodging , too , starting at $69 ( pp/do ) in a slopeside condo and $89 in the Summit Hotel , from March 19 to May 1 . From mid March , Vermont 's Jay Peak ( 800-451-4449 ) invites guests at the Hotel Jay or the resort 's condos to ski free ( a $150 per-person savings on a five-day vacation ) . Jay 's average annual snowfall is Vermont 's greatest , and May 1 is the targeted closing date . Around the same time , Okemo ( 800-78-OKEMO ) starts dropping its daily lift ticket prices in stages , from its top regular-season rate of $45 on weekends . to $40 , $35 , $25 , and perhaps even $20 , with accommodations priced to match .

During value season , a three-night lift-and-lodging deal at a slopeside one-bedroom condo is $264 , compared with $344 regularly . You can get a deal at Killington even earlier by booking through Moguls Ski Tours ( 800-666-4857 ) , which markets primarily to the college market . The tour operator quotes $209 per person for a five-day , five-night package at Mountain Green Condominiums starting February 26 ( except March 22-17 , the Canadian spring break ) , assuming maximum occupancy with a head on each of the six pillows in a two-bedroom unit .

Steamboat ( 800-922-2722 ) finishes the season on a thrifty note with three-day , four-night Last Chance Snowsaver packages starting at $198 ( pp/do ) , available April 3-16 . Considering that a three-day lift ticket during that period is $111 ( down from $126 in regular season ) , the savings mount as the crowds diminish .

California 's traditional spring star is also its southernmost destination resort . Mammoth Mountain ( 800-367-6752 ) , which normally operates into June , offers reduced lift rates ( $30 for an adult all-day ticket ) starting April 24 . Lodging deals start the night before .

There are also value packages offered with accommodations in nearby Bend .

( Call 604-932-2394 . ) Caddyshack in the Mountains Imagine that you could go skiing just like you go golfing at a country club : As you walk through the ski club , friendly employees know your name ; in the locker room , an attendant helps you with your skis and boots ; in the restaurant , they know your favorite meal . An innovative company with a new real-estate concept is trying to create just such a scenario at several ski resorts , with the first " club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Deer Valley , Utah , and several more slated to begin construction this summer at Sun Valley , Idaho , Steamboat Springs , Colorado , and Telluride , Colorado . The Deer Valley Club is not a club in the usual sense of the word  --  there is no voting by members to see whether a prospective member is " good enough " to join . In reality it 's a cross between a country club and a timeshare ( it has 30 townhouses , ranging from two to four bedrooms ) , with the requisite membership credentials being $90,000-$170,000 , plus annual fees of from $4,608-$6,164 ( annual fees include property taxes , maintenance , staffing , repairs , etc . ) . As a real-estate deal  --  the reason for its existence  --  it seems to make sense . Condominiums at Deer Valley are not cheap ; a million-plus is not an unusual selling price . Most condos are bought as second , third , or fourth homes and used for only a short time during the year . At the Deer Valley Club , $94,900 buys use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two weeks in the summer , $129,900 buys the same for a three-bedroom unit , and $179,900 , a four-bedroom . What makes this different from a timeshare is that owners do not buy a specific unit , for a specific time period . Instead they own only a share of the club , and can reserve different times and different units each year . In addition , the planned vacation periods use up only about 50 percent of the total available occupancy , and the remaining days are available to members on a first-come , first-serve basis , either for themselves or for guests . There is no limit on usage . Members pay only weekly housekeeping fees ( $91 for a two-bedroom ) for usage over and above their allotted times . Corporate memberships are also available for a 20 percent premium and provide three weeks usage per season , instead of two . The other thing that makes this concept different from a timeshare is intent . While timeshares were often touted as real-estate investments , the Deer Valley Club is being sold as a luxury item @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you want the hassle-free vacation experience , not because you think you 'll make money off the deal . ( Membership in the club can be sold , however . ) And the luxury items do abound at the Deer Valley Club : valet parking , free airport pickup , a health club , a heated outdoor swimming pool , heated walkways , a gourmet restaurant , pre-arrival grocery delivery , concierge services , slopeside access , business services  --  the list goes on and on . This is not lodging for the masses , although until the club sells out , Rodney Dangerfield , or anybody else for that matter , can stay at the Club ( a two-bedroom unit rents for $745 per night during regular ski season ) . One thing that I like is the limited impact the facility has on the mountains . The 30 townhouses , tastefully built out of cedar , alder , and flagstone , are clustered together on a mid-mountain hillside at Deer Valley . When the club is fully sold , it will have 195 memberships ( 86 had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members had built their own houses or condos , there would be 195 units , instead of 30 , sitting empty most of the year . The club concept seems environmentally far wiser . Call 800-437-5455 for more information . COLLEGE CREDIT Ski areas host all sorts of charity events , benefiting everything from cancer research to ski centers for the disabled , but how many events try to raise money to build a college ? That 's exactly the laudatory goal behind the Fourth Annual Dave McCoy Invitational , to be held at Mammoth Mountain , California , April 14-16 ( Easter weekend ) . The event will feature a benefit ski race , silent and live auctions , book signings and appearances by Warren Miller ( one of the hosts , along with Dave McCoy , Mammoth 's owner ) , and the chance to ski with Glen Plake and Wayne Wong . Proceeds go to the Mammoth Lakes Foundation , which is dedicated to building a permanent campus for a four-year college in the Mammoth area . For information , call 619-934-3781 .
