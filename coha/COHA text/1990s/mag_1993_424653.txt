Physics and biology work together to unravel the basis of movement <p> Viewed through a microscope , a live , cultured cell does n't seem to do much except lie placidly in its dish . <p> But that 's just a facade . The inside of the cell looks like Grand Central Station at rush hour : dizzying traffic , frantic motion . At any given moment , countless objects in the cell are zipping along thread-like tracks , traveling to the cell 's distant reaches and back . <p> Scientists have long known that certain enzymes , called molecular motors or motor proteins , somehow power these and other movements in all living things , from the wiggling of sperm to an organism 's final breath . Existing independently of the nervous system , these enzymes are present in each cell of every organ , setting up an intracellular transport network without which no cell can go about its business . <p> These locomotive enzymes burn a cellular fuel called adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) . They translate that chemical energy into a series of changes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feat goes far beyond enzymes ' traditional role of speeding up biochemical reactions , and it puzzles scientists . In fact , even though the first motor protein was discovered in 1864 , scientists have only recently begun to understand just how these molecules work . <p> Technological advances in biology and physics are revving up research on kinesin and myosin , the two major kinds of motor proteins . Building on research during the last three decades , several groups are now " setting the stage to solve the mechanism by which these biological motors move : ' says Steven M. Block , a biophysicist at the Rowland Institute for Science in Cambridge , Mass . <p> The development 10 years ago of in vitro motility assays - techniques that enable scientists to take motor proteins out of cells and study them on glass slides - " blew the lid off the field , " recounts Block . It allowed researchers to remove motor molecules from their complex environment - the cell - and study their movements under simpler , more tractable conditions . " This was a physicist 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tubes and produce movement under the microscope , " explains Block gleefully . <p> Prior to the early 1980s , scientists could only study whole muscle fibers or motor proteins in solution . The sheer number of motor molecules in such preparations - one muscle fiber contains billions - obscures the action of individual motors . Together with the in vitro assays , that research led to ambiguous results that still provoke heated discussions about how the molecules work . <p> Today , microscope technology has advanced to the point where researchers can examine movement at the level of individual molecules , opening the door to a resolution to the debate . <p> Playing a key role are microscopic optical tweezers , " which use laser beams to make possible the study of single molecules . Another tool , electron microscopic and crystal-structure images of myosin ( SN : 7/3/93 , p.4 ) , allows researchers to picture the interaction of myosin with other proteins in almost atomic detail . Together , these techniques promise to solve the old riddle of how some proteins move . <p> Motor proteins travel along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , railway-like transport system . They perform myriad functions . Kinesin carries vesicles , tiny storage sacs containing chemicals or cellular waste material , from one processing site to the next . Mitochondria , the cell 's tiny power plants that produce ATP , hitch a ride on kinesin , which takes them to where energy is needed . <p> Different proteins serve particular routes . For example , kinesin ferries neurotransmitters down the extensions of nerve cells , whereas dynein , another motor protein , shuttles cargo in the opposite direction , from the nerve terminal back to the center of the cell , says Ronald D. Vale , a cell biologist at the University of California , San Francisco . <p> Myosin , the best-studied molecular motor , works with actin filaments to bring about muscle contractions . Both motors play a role in cell division : Kinesin helps sort out the chromosomes , and myosin then pinches the furrow between the cells , gently forcing them apart . <p> Besides moving particles within cells , molecular motors can drive whole cells , sometimes for long distances . Lymphocytes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; embryonic cells use them to migrate to their final destination in a developing organism . <p> " The definition of life is movement , " says James A. Spudich , a biochemist at Stanford University " Molecular motors are that fundamental . " <p> Recently , Block and his collaborators have for the first time " watched " the gait of individual kinesin molecules . While directing the spotlight of a laser beam onto single molecules , the researchers found that kinesin actually walks along its protein rail , or microtubule , in discrete little steps of 8 nanometers each . They describe their study in the Oct. 21 NATURE . <p> " Does kinesin slide along smoothly does it walk in a stepwise fashion , or herky-jerky ? This fundamental question has never been answered adequately until now , " says Block . <p> " It 's a brilliant piece of work , " comments Vale , who discovered kinesin in 1984 . " It clearly shows kinesin making distinct steps , something people in the field have tried to see for a long time . " <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current understanding of the structure of microtubules , thread-like protein polymers , says Vale . When a microtubule forms , its individual protein units line up in such a way that a binding site for kinesin appears every 8 nanometers - exactly the distance Block 's group has measured between steps . Vale likens kinesin 's movement along a microtubule to walking across a pond on evenly spaced stepping-stones . <p> While these measurements represent a quantum leap for kinesin research , they raise the question of exactly how kinesin moves . The detailed structure of the molecule remains unknown , but researchers do know that it has two domains that generate movement . Attached to each of these domains is a long , thin tail , and the two tails wind around each other . Eight nanometers , ordinarily a tiny distance , is huge for kinesin , whose motile region measures only 9 nanometers across . " Just bending kinesin 's motor domain wo n't move it by 8 nanometers , " says Vale . <p> Based on this sketchy structure , researchers assume that kinesin , a two-legged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , he adds , this notion rests on little hard evidence because of the relative dearth of data on kinesin . <p> No lack of data plagues myosin researchers . They drew up a detailed model describing its mode of action 25 years ago . But since then , supporting experimental evidence " has not materialized in quite the way people had hoped , " ' says Block . Consequently , the theory has come under attack in recent years . <p> The hypothesis holds that myosin molecules , arranged in long filaments , latch on to binding sites along actin filaments and perform a " power stroke " that pulls the actin filament past the myosin filament . They then let go of the actin and grab on to another binding site , farther downstream , to crank out the next stroke . Developed in the 1960s and elaborated ever since , the model suggests that myosin has a lever-like arm that enables it to ratchet its way along the actin filament . <p> This scenario is featured in every biochemistry textbook , but the structural changes in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prove . Though many researchers still regard the model as correct , others doubt it . Toshio Yanagida of Osaka University in Japan has called for an entirely " new conceptual framework " to account for myosin 's mode of action . <p> Much of the disagreement concerns the motor 's mileage , or how far it can go per unit of fuel . While the standard myosin model proposes a step of about 10 nanometers per molecule of ATP , Yanagida 's studies indicate that a myosin motor can leap up to several hundred nanometers per ATP molecule and suggest that the exact distance can vary , depending on how hard the muscle works . <p> The debate stems from experiments involving large numbers of motor molecules . Since larger numbers mask the action of individual molecules , Spudich and his co-workers turned to optical tweezers to try to settle the dispute . Over several years , they adapted optical tweezer technology-also known as laser light traps - to the study of myosin . Then earlier this year , while observing single myosin proteins at work , the Stanford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes along actin . <p> The group 's findings land smack in the middle of the controversy surrounding myosin 's mechanism . " We asked the question whether myosin jumps along actin filaments in big leaps or marches in sequential little steps , and we observed very clear , small steps , " says Spudich . " When myosin grabs the actin filament and pulls on it , we record 10-nanometer blips . " His group also used light-trap technology to measure the horsepower of the minute motor and found it to be " about 5 piconewtons per stroke . " <p> The 10-nanometer stride length makes sense from a structural point of view , Spudich says , because studies have shown the myosin protein to sport a thin , extended " neck . " That neck could cause a 5- to 10-nanometer displacement when snapping backward in the large structural change that researchers think is at the heart of the mysterious power stroke . <p> Thus the Stanford researchers ' findings provide direct support for the conventional model . Moreover , the results of the Rowland group are consistent with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different molecular motor , Block 's co-workers measured small steps rather than big leaps and report evidence that , under certain experimental conditions , kinesin advances one step per molecule of ATP burned . <p> However , " our data only describe what kinesin does , " Block cautions . Regarding myosin , he adds , " the techniques that were available previously were not sensitive enough to resolve the controversy " <p> The optical tweezers that are now boosting molecular motor research resemble the " tractor beam , " a beacon of light that captures , stalls , or moves objects around on " Star Trek . " The real-life cousin of the fictitious tool is too weak even to hold a pinhead . But when shone through a microscope , the tiny piconewton forces that an intense laser beam can exert prove ideal for manipulating objects in cellular space . The molecules are n't damaged because they do n't absorb the wavelength used . <p> First developed by physicists at AT &T; Bell Laboratories in Holmdel , N.J. ( SN : 3/10/90 , p.148 ) , the technique enables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Block 's and Spudich 's groups independently developed the laser trap further to apply it to the study of motor proteins . A graduate student in Block 's laboratory Karel Svoboda , combined the trap with an interferometer , a device that measures minute differences in the wave pattern of light diffracted by a particle in its path . This marriage yielded a new instrument , dubbed the " optical trapping interferometer , " that can detect " the displacement of a tiny object to within an angstrom , which is the diameter of a hydrogen atom , " explains Block . It does so in a thousandth of a second . <p> The researchers paid a price for that precision , though . " It took us several years to insulate our measurements from all kinds of disturbances , " says Block . For example , Brownian motion , the random movement of water molecules in solution , jostles the tiny objects . In studying specimens as small as a single molecule , says Block , Brownian motion can cause spurious signals that are larger than the signals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Moreover , airborne vibrations proved notorious troublemakers , Block recounts . Since the interferometer is sensitive enough to pick up the sound waves of a conversation , the researchers conducted many of their experiments at night , when the lab was quieter , he says . <p> Once everything was still , they could record the gait of one kinesin molecule , but only after shifting it into first gear . In a cell , kinesin speeds at about 1 micrometer per second , the equivalent of a person running at 55 miles per hour . To measure its movement reliably , the investigators had to slow it down to about 0.01 micrometer per second , Block explains . <p> While the Rowland researchers stayed up late with their laser beam , Spudich 's group across the country also spent nightly vigils with lasers . They devised a method of stretching a normally floppy actin filament taut between two laser beams and then lowering the filament to touch a single myosin molecule , Spudich explains . With the two laser beams holding the ends of the actin filament fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actin by the myosin molecule . They did so by adding a feedback loop to the laser trap . That allowed them to record the force with which the actin filament tried to escape the grip of the laser beams , says Spudich . <p> Optical tweezers " seem to be the way to go to answer many questions , " says Vale . But , he adds , " they do not tell us the entire story They reveal nothing about the structural changes in the motor molecules that accompany the steps . That area is extremely important but still a black box for kinesin . " <p> Again , researchers studying myosin have made some headway in assembling data from structural biology and optical tweezers into a complete picture . The crystal structure of myosin - its three-dimensional makeup-has been unveiled recently and imaged with near-atomic resolution , summing up what Block calls " 20 years of biochemistry on myosin . " <p> In a report accompanying the publication of myosin 's crystal structure , a team of researchers collaborated to produce a detailed model of the sequence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involves the alternate opening and closing of myosin 's several clefts and pockets . To develop the model , the researchers also used the previously discovered structure of actin and computer models illustrating how myosin and actin bind ( and function ) together in the elaborate superstructure of a muscle filament . <p> To understand how myosin moves past actin filaments , one needs to know how " the high-resolution crystal structures of actin and myosin fit together to form the large assembly of a muscle filament , " says Ronald A. Milligan , a partner in the collaboration . <p> To find that out , Milligan , a cell biologist at Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla , Calif. , began with electron-microscopic images of a muscle filament . Processing these images with computerized image-analysis techniques yielded " three-dimensional maps , " which show the assembly 's contours , complete with all its bulges and grooves . <p> Into these contours Milligan and his coworkers then docked the crystal structure of myosin . Marking reference points on the proteins with the element gold , they were able to see in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they constructed an image of how all the individual proteins come together to form the working assembly found in the cell , he explains . Armed with such detailed knowledge of how actin and myosin interact , the team was able to draw up a step-by-step scenario for myosin 's power stroke . <p> That scenario is n't entirely proved , nor do the new mechanical measurements make an airtight case . But with motor research on the move , " the pieces of the puzzle may soon be put together , " says Spudich . " For us , that is a dream come true .
