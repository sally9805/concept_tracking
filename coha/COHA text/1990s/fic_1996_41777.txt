Peter had always been more than thoughtful in not pressing her about her past , and Beatrice was sure it was a reason for her choice of him . Most men , coming of age in a time that extolled openness and disclosure , would have thought themselves remiss in questioning her so little . Perhaps because he was a New Englander  --  one of four sons in a family that had been stable for generations  --  perhaps because he was a mathematician , perhaps because both the sight of her and her way of living had pleased him from the first and continued to please him , he had been satisfied with what she was willing to tell . " My parents are dead . We lived in Western New York State , near Rochester . I am an only child . I have no family left . " <p> She preferred saying " I have no family left "  --  creating with her words an absence , a darkness , rather than to say what had been there , what she had ruthlessly left , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later . She had left them so thoroughly that she really did n't know if they were still living . When she tried to locate them , with her marriage and her children and the warm weight of her domestic safety at her back , there was no trace of them . It had shocked and frightened her how completely they had failed to leave a trace . This was the sort of thing most people did n't think of : how possible it was for people like her parents to impress themselves so little on the surface , the many surfaces of the world , that they would leave it or inhabit it with the same lack of a mark . <p> They were horrors , her parents , the sort people wanted to avert their eyes from , that people felt it was healthful to avert their eyes from . They had let their lives slip very far , further than anyone Beatrice now knew could even begin to imagine . But it had always been like that : a slippage so continuous that there was simultaneously a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was terribly clear to her . She was brought up in filth . Most people , Beatrice knew , believed that filth was temporary , one of those things , unlike disease or insanity or social hatred  --  that did n't root itself in but was an affair of surfaces , therefore dislodgeable by effort , will , and the meagerest brand of intelligence . That was , Beatrice knew , because people did n't understand filth . They mistook its historical ordinariness for simplicity . They did n't understand the way it could invade and settle , take over , dominate , and for good , until it became , inevitably , the only true thing about a place and the only lives that could be lived there . Dust , grime , the grease of foods , the residues of bodies , the smells that lived in the air , palpable , malign , unidentifiable , impossible to differentiate : an ugly population of refugees from an unknowable location , permanent , stubborn , knife-faced settlers who had right of occupancy  --  the place was theirs now  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for food , and the rent must have been paid to someone . They had always lived in the one house : her mother , her father , and herself . Who could have owned it ? Who would have put money down for such a place ? One-story , nearly windowless , the outside walls made of soft shingle in the semblance of pinkish gray brick . It must have been built from the first entirely without love , with the most cynical understanding , Beatrice had always thought , of the human need for shelter and the dollar value that it could bring . Everything was cheap and thin , done with the minimum of expense and of attention . No thought was given to ornament or amplitude , or even to the long , practical run : what would n't age horribly or crumble , splinter , quickly fade . <p> As she grew older , she believed the house had been built to hide some sort of criminality . It was in the middle of the woods , down a dirt road half a mile down Highway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south , she somehow thought , to Pennsylvania . Her parents said it had once been a hunting lodge , but she did n't believe it . When she was old enough to have learned about bootlegging , and knew that whiskey had been smuggled in from Canada , she was convinced that the house had had something to do with that . She could always imagine petty gangsters , local thugs in mean felt hats and thin-soled shoes trading liquor for money , throwing their cigarette butts down on the hard , infertile ground , then driving away from the house , not giving it a thought until it was time for their next deal . <p> Sometimes she thought it was the long periods of uninhabitedness that gave the house its closed , and vengeful , character . But when she began to think like that , it was n't long before she understood that kind of thought to be fantastical . It was n't the house , houses had no will or nature . Her parents had natures , and it was their lives and the way they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had awakened each day in dread , afraid to open her eyes , knowing the first thing they fell on would be ugly . She did n't even know where she could get something for herself that might be beautiful . The word could n't have formed itself in her mind in any way that could attach to an object that was familiar to her , or that she could even imagine having access to . She heard , as if from a great distance , people using the word " beautiful " in relation to things like trees or sunsets , but her faculty for understanding things like this had been so crippled that the attempt to comprehend what people were saying when they spoke like this filled her with a kind of panic . She could n't call up even the first step that would allow her , even in the far future , to come close to what they meant . They were talking about things out of doors when they talked about trees and sunsets . And what was the good of that ? You could go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brightness of the sun , the freshness of a tree would greet you , but in the end you would only have to go back somewhere to sleep . And that would not be beautiful ; it would be where you lived . So beauty seemed a dangerous , foreign , and irrelevant idea . She turned for solace , not to it , but to the nature of enclosure . Everything in her life strained toward the ideal of separations : how to keep the horror of her parents ' life from everything that could be called her life . <p> She learned what it was she wanted from watching her grade school teachers cutting simple shapes  --  squares , triangles  --  and writing numbers in straight columns on the blackboard or on paper with crisp , straight blue lines . The whiteness of pages , the unmuddled black of print , struck her as desirable ; the dry rasping of the scissors , the click of a stapler , the riffling of a rubber band around a set of children 's tests . She understood all these things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosperous ; they were poor . But she knew as well that their real affliction was n't poverty but something different  --  you might , perhaps , say worse  --  but not connected to money . If she could have pointed to that  --  a simple lack of money-it would have been more hopeful for her . But she knew it was n't poverty that was the problem . It was the way her parents were . It was what they did . <p> They drank . That was what they did . It was , properly speaking , the only thing they did . But no , she always told herself when she began to think that way , it was n't the only thing . Her father , after all , had gone out to work . He was a gravedigger in a Catholic cemetery . Each morning he woke in the dark house . Massive , nearly toothless , and still in his underwear , he drank black coffee with a shot in it for breakfast , and then put on his dark-olive work pants and shirts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cap  --  and started the reluctant car driving down the dirt road . He came home at night , with a clutch of bottles in a paper bag , to begin drinking . He was n't violent or abusive ; he was interested only in the stupor he could enter and inhabit . This , Beatrice knew early on , was his true home . <p> Her mother woke late , her hair in pin curls wrapped in a kerchief , which she rarely bothered to undo . She was skeletally thin ; her skin was always in a state of dull eruptions ; red spidery veins on her legs always seemed to Beatrice to be the tracks of a slow disease . Just out of bed , she poured herself a drink , not bothering to hide it in coffee , and drank it from a glass that had held cheese spread mixed with pimentos , which her parents ate on crackers when they drank , and which was often Beatrice 's supper . Beatrice 's mother would sit for a while on the plaid couch , watch television , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always silent ; there were as few words in the house as there were ornaments . It was another reason Peter liked her . She had a gift , he said , for silence , a gift he respected , that he said too few people had . She wondered if he would have prized this treasure if he 'd known its provenance . <p> Beatrice saw everything her parents did because she slept in the large room . When she was born , her parents had put a crib for her in the corner of the room nearest their bedroom , opposite the wall where the sink , the stove , and the refrigerator were . It did n't occur to them that she might want privacy ; when she grew taller , they replaced her crib with a bed , but they never imagined she had any more rights or desires than an infant . The torpor , the disorder of their lives , spread into her quarters . For years , it anguished her to see their slippers , their half-read newspapers , broken bobby pins , half-empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she thought of as hers . When she was ten , she bought some clothesline and some tacks . She bought an Indian bedspread from a hippie store in town ; rose-colored , with a print of tigers ; the only vivid thing in the place . She made a barrier between herself and them . Her father said something unkind about it , but she took no notice . <p> For the six years after that , she came home as little as she could , staying in the school library until it closed , walking home miles in the darkness . She sat on her bed , did what was left of her homework , and , as early as possible , lay down to sleep . At sunrise , she would leave the house , walking the roads till something opened in the town  --  the library , the five-and-ten , the luncheonette  --  then walking for more hours till the sun set . She did n't love the woods ; she did n't think of them as nature , with all the implications she had read about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no choice but to be there again , but not quite there , not in the place that was theirs , but her place , behind her curtain , where she need n't see the way they lived . <p> She moved out of her parents ' house two days after she graduated from high school . She packed her few things and moved to Buffalo , where she got a job in a tool and die factory , took night courses at the community college . She did this for five years , then took all her savings and enrolled in the elementary education program at the University of Buffalo full time . She 'd planned it all out carefully , in her tiny room , living on yogurt she made from powdered milk , allowing it to ferment in a series of thermoses she 'd bought at garage sales , eating the good parts of half-rotten fruit and vegetables she 'd bought for pennies , the fresh middle parts of loaves of day-old bread . Never , in those years , did she buy a new blouse or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Salvation Army ; it was only later , after she married , that she learned to sew . <p> In her second semester , she met Peter in a very large class : European History 1789-1945 . He said he 'd fallen in love with several things about her almost at once : the look of her notebooks , the brilliant white of the collar of her shirt as it peeked over the top of her pastel-blue Shetland sweater , the sheer pink curves of her fingernails . He said he 'd been particularly taken by her thumb . Most women 's thumbs were ugly and betrayed the incompleteness of their femininity , the essential coarseness of it . The fineness of her thumb , the way the nail curved and was placed within the flesh , showed there was n't a trace of coarseness in her : everything connected with her was , and would always be , fine . He did n't find out until they 'd dated a few times that she was older , more than three years older than he was . He accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents had  --  tragically  --  died . <p> Beatrice knew what Peter saw when he looked at her : clarity and simplicity and thrift , an almost holy sign of order , a plain creature without hidden parts or edges , who would sail through life before him making a path through murky seas , leaving to him plain sailing : nothing in the world to obstruct him or the free play of his mind . She knew that he did n't realize that he had picked her in part for the emptiness of her past , imagining a beautiful blankness , blameless , unpopulated , clear . His pity for her increased her value for him : she was an exile in the ordinary world he was born into , lacking the encumbrances that could make for problems in his life . He believed that life could be simple , that he would leave from a cloudless day and drop into the teeming fog of mathematics , which for him was peopled , creatured , a tumultuous society he had to colonize and civilize and rule . <p> She knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , turning to her at night with the anomaly of his ardor , another equation she could elegantly solve . His curiosity about the shape of her desire was as tenderly blunted as his curiosity about her past , and she was as glad of the one as of the other . Making love to him , an occurrence she found surprisingly frequent , she could pretend she was sitting through a violent and fascinating storm that certainly would pass . Having got through it , she could be covered over in grateful tenderness for the life that he made possible : a life of clean linen and bright rooms , of matched dishes and a variety of specialized kitchen items : each unique , for one use only , and not , as everything in her mother 's house was , interchangeable . <p> So the children came , three boys , and then the farmhouse , bought as a wreck , transformed by Beatrice Talbot into a treasure , something acquaintances came to see as much ( more , she thought , if they were honest ) as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and additions on the house : a sewing room , a greenhouse , then uncovering the old woodwork , searching out antique stores , auctions , flea markets for the right furniture  --  all this researched in the university library and in the local library  --  and the children growing and needing care so that by the time Peter came home with the news that was the first breakup of the smooth plane that had been their life together , the children had become , somehow , twelve , ten , and eight . <p> He had won a really spectacular fellowship at Columbia , three years being paid twice what he made at Cornell and no teaching , and a chance to work beside the man who was tops in his field . Peter asked Beatrice what she thought , but only formally . They both knew . They would be going to New York . <p> Nights in the house ten miles above Ithaca  --  it was summer and in her panic she could hear the crickets and , toward dawn , smell the freshness of the wet grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead of her . Everything , each thing she owned , would have to be wrapped and collected . She lived in dread of losing something , breaking something , for each carefully selected , carefully tended object that she owned was a proof of faith against the dark clutching power of the past . She typed on an index card a brief but wholly accurate description of the house , and the housing office presented her with a couple from Berlin  --  particle physicists , the both of them , and without children , she was grateful to hear . They seemed clean and thorough ; they wanted to live in the country , they were the type who would know enough to act in time if a problem were occurring , who would n't let things get too far . <p> Peter and Beatrice were assured by everyone they talked to in New York that their apartment was a jewel . Sally Rodier , the wife of Peter 's collaborator , who also helped Beatrice place the children in private schools , kept telling her how incredibly lucky they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the buildings on Riverside Drive . The view could be better , but they had a glimpse of the river . Really , they were almost disgustingly lucky , she said , laughing . Did they know what people would do to get what they had ? <p> But Beatrice 's heart sank at the grayness of the grout between the small octagonal bathroom floor tiles , the uneven job of polyurethaning on the living room floor , the small hole in the floor by the radiator base , the stiff door on one of the kitchen cabinets , the frosted glass on the window near the shower that she could n't , whatever she did , make look clean . <p> For nearly a month she worked , making the small repairs herself , unheard-of behavior , Sally Rodier said , in a Columbia tenant . She poured a lake of bleach on the bathroom floor , left it for six hours , then , sopping it up , found she had created a field of dazzling whiteness . She made curtains ; she scraped the edges of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had been so few places , had done so little , that the city streets , although they frightened her , began to seem a place of quite exciting possibilities . Because she did her errands , for the first time in her life , on foot , she could have human contact with no fear of revelation . She could be among her kind without fear every second that they would find out about her : where and what she 'd come from , who she really was . Each day the super left mail on her threshold ; they would exchange a pleasant word or two . He was a compact and competent man who had left his family in Peru . She could imagine that he and the Bangladeshi doormen , and the people on the streets , all possessed a dark and complicated past , things they 'd prefer to have hidden as she did . In Buffalo , in Ithaca , people had seemed to be expressing everything they were . Even their reserves seemed legible and therefore relatively simple . But , riding on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time part of the web of concealment , of lives constructed like a house with rooms that gave access only to each other , rooms far from the initial entrance , with no source of natural light . <p> By Thanksgiving , she was able to tell Peter , who feared that she would suffer separation from her beloved house , that she was enjoying herself very much . The boys , whose lives , apart from their aspects of animal survival , never seemed to have much to do with her , were absorbed in the thick worlds of their schools  --  activities till five or six most nights , homework , and supper and more homework . Weekends , she could leave them to Peter , who was happy to take them to the park for football , or to the university pool , or the indoor track . She would often go to the Metropolitan Museum , to look at the collection of American furniture or , accompanied by a guide book , on an architectural tour . <p> One Thursday night , Peter was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the room the two younger ones shared , throwing a ball made of foam through the hoop Peter had nailed against the door . Beatrice was surprised to hear the bell ring ; people rarely came without telephoning first . She opened the door to a stranger , but catching a glimpse of her neighbor across the hall , a history professor , opening her door , she did n't feel afraid . <p> The man at the doorway was unlike anyone she had spoken to in New York , anyone she 'd spoken to since she 'd left home . But in an instant she recognized him . She thought he was there to tell her the story of her life , and to tell Peter and everyone she knew . <p> She 'd never met him , as himself , before . But he could have lived in the house she 'd been born in . He had an unrushed look , as if he had all the time in the world . He took a moment to meet her eyes , but when he did , finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> She kept the door mostly closed , leaving only enough space for her body . She would allow him to hurt her , if that was what he came for , but she would n't let him in the house . <p> " I 'm your downstairs neighbor , " he said . <p> She opened the door wider . He was wearing a greasy-looking ski jacket which had once been royal blue ; a shiny layer of black grime covered the surface like soot on old snow . The laces on his black sneakers had no tips . His pants were olive green ; his hands were in his pockets . It was impossible to guess how old he was . He was missing several top teeth , which made him look not young , but his hair fell over his eyes in a way that bestowed youth . She stepped back a pace further into the hall . <p> " What can I do for you ? " <p> " You 've got kids ? " <p> For a moment , she thought he meant to take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the apartment , running , laughing , innocent of what she was sure would befall them . A sense of heavy torpor took her up . She felt that whatever this man wanted , she would have to let him take . A half-enjoyable lassitude came over her . She knew she could n't move . <p> He was waiting for her answer . " I have three boys , " she said . <p> " Well , what you can do for me is to tell them to stop their racket . All day , all night , night and day , bouncing the ball . The plaster is coming down off the ceiling . It 's hitting me in my bed . That 's not too much to ask , is it ? You can see that 's not too much to ask . " <p> " No , of course not . No , " she said . " I 'll see to it right away . " <p> She closed the door very quickly . Walking to the back part of the apartment , she had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she would n't scream the words to her children . " They did n't know , they did n't know , " she kept saying to herself . It was n't their fault . They were n't used to living in an apartment . It was n't anybody 's fault . But she was longing to scream at them , for having made this happen . For doing something so she would have to see that man , would have to think about him . An immense distaste for her children came over her . They seemed loud and gross and spoiled and careless . They knew nothing of the world . They were passing the ball back and forth to one another , their blond hair gleaming in the light that shone down from the fixture overhead . <p> She forced herself to speak calmly . " I 'm afraid you ca n't play basketball here , " she said . " The man downstairs complained . " <p> " What 'd you say to him ? " asked Jeff , the oldest . <p> " I said I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say that for ? We have just as much right as he does . " <p> She looked at her son coldly . " I 'm afraid you do n't . " <p> The three of them looked back at her , as if they 'd never seen her . <p> " I 'll make supper now , " she said . " But I have a terrible headache . After I put dinner on the table , I 'm going to lie down . " <p> While she was cooking , the phone rang . It was her neighbor across the hall . " Terribly sorry to intrude , " she said . " I hope I 'm not being a busybody , but I could n't help overhear the rather unpleasant exchange you had with our neighbor . I just thought you should understand a few things . " <p> I understand everything , Beatrice wanted to say . There 's nothing I do n't understand . <p> " He 's a pathetic case . Used to be a big shot in the chemistry department . Boy genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes , stopped showing up in the department . But some bigwigs in the administration were on his side , and he 's been on disability and allowed to keep the apartment . We 're all stuck with him . If he ever opens the door and you 're near , you get a whiff of the place . Unbelievable . It 's unbelievable how people live . What I 'm trying to tell you is , do n't let him get you bent out of shape . Occasionally he crawls out of his cave and growls something , but he 's quite harmless . " <p> " Thank you , " said Beatrice . " Thank you for calling . Thank you very much . " <p> She put down the phone , walked into her bedroom , turned out all the lights , and lay down on her bed . <p> Lying in the dark , she knew it was impossible that he was underneath her . If his room was below the children 's , it was near the other side of the apartment , far from where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his breathing . It matched her own : in-out-in-out . Just like hers . <p> She breathed with him . In and out , and in and out . Frightened , afraid to leave the bed , she lay under a quilt she 'd made herself . She forced herself to think of the silver scissors , her gold thimble , the spools and spools of pale thread . Tried and tried to call them back , a pastel shimmering cloud , a thickness glowing softly in this darkness . It would come , then fade , swallowed up in darkness . Soon the darkness was all there was . It was everything . It was everything she wanted and her only terror was that she would have to leave it and go back . Outside the closed door , she could hear the voices of her husband and her sons . She put her fingers in her ears so she could n't hear them . She prayed , she did n't know to whom , to someone who inhabited the same darkness . This was the only thing about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that her family would forget about her , leave her . She dreaded the door 's cracking , the intrusion of the light . If she could just be here , in darkness , breathing in and out , with him as he breathed in and out . Then . Then she did n't know . But it would be something that she feared . <p> " How about you tone it down and let your mother sleep ? " She closed her eyes as tightly as a child in nightmare . Then she knew that she had been , in fact , asleep because when Peter came in , sank his weight onto the bed , she understood she had to start pretending to be sleeping . <p> After that night , she began staying in bed all day long . She had so rarely been sick , had met the occasional cold or bout of flu with so much stoicism that Peter could n't help but believe her when she complained of a debilitating headache . And it would have been impossible for him to connect her behavior with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No one had seen him except her and the woman across the hall who told her what she did n't need to know , what she already knew , what she could n't help knowing . <p> She wondered how long it would be before Peter suggested calling a doctor . That was what worried her as she lay in the darkness : what would happen , what would be the thing she would n't be able to resist , the thing that would force her to get up . <p> She cut herself off fully from the life of the family . She had no idea what kind of life was going on outside her door . Peter was coping very well , without a question or murmur of complaint . Cynically , she thought it was easier for him not to question : he might learn something he did n't want to know . He had joined up with her so they could create a world free from disturbance , from disturbances . Now the disturbance rumbled beneath them , and it only stood to reason that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . <p> Each morning , she heard the door close as Peter left with the children for school . Then she got up , bathed , fixed herself a breakfast , and , exhausted , fell back into a heavy sleep . She would sleep through the afternoon . In the evening , Peter brought her supper on a tray . The weak light from the lamp on the bed table hurt her eyes ; the taste and textures of the food hurt her palate , grown fragile from so much silence , so much sleep . <p> She did n't ask what the children were doing and they did n't come in to see her . Peter assumed she was in excruciating pain . She said nothing to give him that idea , and nothing to relieve him of it . <p> After her fourth day in the dark , she heard the doorbell ring . It was early evening , the beginning of December . Night had completely fallen and the radiators hissed and cooed . She tried not to hear what was going on outside , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouting . " Children , " " Natural " Ordinary . " " Play " Rights " No right . " <p> Alarm , a spot of electric blue spreading beneath one of her ribs , made her understand that Peter was shouting at the man downstairs . She jumped out of bed and stood at the door of the bedroom . She could see Peter 's back , tensed as she had , in fourteen years of marriage , never seen it . His fists were clenched at his side . <p> " You come here , bothering my wife , disturbing my family . I do n't know where the hell ... what makes you think ... but you 've got the wrong number , mister . My sons are going to play ball occasionally at a reasonable hour . It 's five-ten in the afternoon . Do n't tell me you 're trying to sleep . " <p> " All right , buddy . All right . We 'll just see about sleeping . Some night come midnight when everyone in your house is fast asleep , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know how to make a disturbance . " <p> Peter shut the door in the man 's face . He turned around , pale , his fists not yet unclenched . <p> " Why did n't you tell me about that guy ? " he said , standing so close to her that his voice hurt her ears , which had heard very little in the last four days . <p> " I was n't feeling well , " she said . <p> He nodded . She knew he had n't heard her . <p> " Better get back into bed . " <p> The doorbell rang again . Peter ran to it , his fists clenched once again . But it was n't the man downstairs , it was the woman across the hall . Beatrice could hear her telling Peter the same story she 'd told her , but with more details . " The house is full of broken machines , he takes them apart for some experiment he says he 's doing . He says he 's going to be able to create enough energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can live on five dollars a week . " <p> " Low overhead , " said Peter , and the two of them laughed . <p> She was back in the darkness . Her heart was a swollen muscle ; she spread her hands over her chest to slow it down . She heard Peter calling Al Rodier . <p> " Do you believe it ... university building ... speak to someone in real estate first thing ... right to the top if necessary ... will not put up with it ... hard to evict , but not impossible . Despoiling the environment ... polluting the air we breathe . " <p> The word " pollution " spun in her brain like one of those headlines in old movies : one word finally comprehensible after the turning blur : Strike . War . <p> Pollution . It suggested a defilement so complete , so permanent , that nothing could reverse it . Clear streams turned black and tarlike , verdant forests transformed to soot-covered stumps , the air full of black flakes that settled on the skin and could n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was doing ? He was living the way he wanted to , perhaps the only way he could . Before this incident , he had n't disturbed them . They were the first to disturb him . People had a right not to hear thumping over their heads . Supposing he was trying to read , listening to music , working out a scientific formula . Suppose , when the children were making that noise , he was on the phone making an important call , the call that could change his life . <p> It was n't likely . What was more likely was that he was lying in the dark , as she was . But not as she was . He was n't lying in an empty bed . He bedded down in garbage . And the sound of thumping over his head was the sound of all his fear : that he would be named the names that he knew fit him , but could bear if they were n't said . " Disreputable .

They were not unjust . Justice was entirely on their side . He could n't possibly , in justice , speak a word in his own defense . Stone-faced , empty-handed , he would have to follow them into the open air . <p> She heard Peter on the phone calling the people they knew in the building who 'd invited them for coffee or for brunch . She kept hearing him say his name  --  Peter Talbot  --  and his department  --  Mathematics , and the number of their apartment  --  4A .

" <p> She saw them filing into her house , their crisp short hair , their well-tended shoes , the smiles cutting across their faces like a rifle shot . They would march in , certain of their right to be there , their duty to keep order . Not questioning the essential rightness of clearing out the swamp , the place where disease bred , and necessarily , of course , removing the breeders and the spreaders who , if left to themselves , would contaminate the world . <p> And Beatrice knew that they were right , that was the terrible thing about them , their unquestionable rightness . Right to clear out , break in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health of the world might be preserved . <p> She sank down deeper . She was there with those who wallowed , burrowed , hoarded , their weak eyes half-closed , their sour voices , not really sour but hopeless at the prospect of trying to raise some objection , of offering some resistance . They knew there could be no negotiation , since they had no rights . So their petition turned into a growl , a growl that only stiffened the righteousness of their purpose . " Leave me alone , " is all the ones who hid were saying . They would have liked to beseech but they were afraid to . Also full of hate . " Leave me alone . " <p> Of course they would n't be left alone . They could n't be . Beatrice understood that . <p> The skin around her eyes felt flayed , her limbs were heavy , her spine too weak to hold her up . " Leave me alone The sweetness of the warm darkness , like a poultice , was all that could protect her from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She and the man downstairs breathed . In and out . She heard their joined breath and , underneath that sound , the opening of doors , the rush of violent armies , of flame , of tidal wave , lightning cleaving a moss-covered tree in two . And then something else below that : " Can not . Can not . Leave me alone Unheeded . <p> She turned the light on in the bedroom . She put on a pair of light blue sweatpants and a matching sweatshirt . On her feet she wore immaculate white socks and the white sneakers she 'd varnished to brilliance with a product called Sneaker White she 'd bought especially . She put on earrings , perfume , but no lipstick and no blush . She walked out of the apartment . She knew that Peter , in the back with the children , would n't hear the door close . <p> She walked down the dank , faintly ill-smelling stairs to the apartment situated exactly as hers was  --  3A  --  and rang the bell . He opened the door a crack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have made her sick , but she knew she was beyond that sort of thing . <p> She looked him in the eye . " I need to talk to you : ' she said . He shrugged then smiled . Most of his top teeth were gone and the ones that were left were yellowed and streaked . He pushed the lock of his blondish hair that fell into his forehead back , away from his eyes . Then he took a comb out of his pocket and pulled it through his hair . <p> " Make yourself at home , " he said , laughing morosely . <p> There was hardly a place to stand . The floor space was taken up by broken radios , blenders , ancient portable TVs revealing blown tubes , disconnected wires , a double-size mattress . Beside the mattress were paper plates with hardened sandwiches , glimpses of pink ham , tomatoes turned to felt between stone-colored slices of bread , magazines with wrinkled pages , unopened envelopes ( yellow , white , mustard-colored ) , sloping hills of clean underwear mixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were no sheets on the mattress ; sheets , she could tell , had been given up long ago . Loosely spread over the blue ticking was a pinkish blanket , its trim a trap , a bracelet for the foot to catch itself in during the uneasy night . <p> A few feet from the mattress was a Barcalounger whose upholstery must once have been mustard-colored . The headrest was a darker shade , almost brown ; she understood that the discoloration was from the grease of his hair when he leaned back . She moved some copies of Popular Mechanics and some Styrofoam containers , hamburger-sized , to make room for herself to sit . She tried to imagine what she looked like , in her turquoise sweatsuit , sitting in this chair . <p> " I came to warn you , " she said . " They 're having a meeting . Right now in my apartment . They want to have you evicted . " <p> He laughed , and she could see that his top teeth looked striated , lines of brownish yellow striping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on anyone else . <p> " Relax , " he said . " It 'll never happen . They keep trying , but it 'll never happen . This is New York . I 'm a disabled person . I 'm on disability . You understand what that means ? Nobody like me gets evicted in New York . Do n't worry about it . I 'll be here forever . " <p> She looked at her neighbor and gave him a smile so radiant that it seemed to partake of prayer . And then a torpor that was not somnolent , but full of joy , took hold of her . Her eyes were closing themselves with happiness . She needed rest . Why had n't she ever known before that rest was the one thing she had always needed ? <p> She saw her white bathroom floor , gleaming from the lake of bleach she had poured on it . Just thinking of it hurt her eyes . <p> Here , there was nothing that would hurt her . She wanted to tell him it was beautiful here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But she was too tired to speak . And that was fine , she knew he understood . Here , where they both were , there was no need to say a word . <p> But he was saying something . She could hear it through her sleep , and she had to swim up to get it , like a fish surfacing for crumbs . She could n't seem , quite , to open her eyes and she fell back down to the dark water . Then she felt him shaking her by the shoulders . <p> " What are you doing ? What are you doing ? You ca n't do that here . " <p> She looked at his eyes . They were n't looking at her kindly . She had thought he would be kind . She blinked several times , then closed her eyes again . When she opened them , he was still standing above her , his hands on her shoulders , shaking them , his eyes unkind . <p> " You ca n't do that here . You ca n't just come down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my place . Now get out . " <p> He was telling her she had to leave . She supposed she understood that . She could n't stay here if he did n't want her . She had thought he 'd understand that what she needed was a place to rest , just that , she would n't be taking anything from him . But he was treating her like a thief . He was making her leave as if she were a criminal . There was no choice now but to leave , shamefully , like a criminal . <p> He closed the door behind her . Although her back was to the door , she felt he was closing it in her face and she felt the force of it exactly on her face as if his hand had struck it . She stood completely still , her back nearly touching the brown door . <p> She could n't move . She could n't move because she could think of no direction that seemed sensible . But the shame of his having thrown her out propelled her toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the building as she was . With no coat , no money , nothing to identify her . But she knew that was n't possible . It was winter , and it was New York . <p> She walked up the stairs . She stood on the straw mat in front of her own door . She 'd have to ring the bell ; she had n't brought her keys . Peter would wonder where she had gone . She did n't know what she 'd tell him . There was nothing to say . <p> She did n't know what would happen now . She knew only that she must ring the bell and see her husband 's face and then walk into the apartment . It was the place she lived and she had nowhere else to go . <p>
