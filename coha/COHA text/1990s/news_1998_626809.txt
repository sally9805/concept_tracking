<p> In many ways , they are like the Twin Towers of Mayor Lee Brown 's administration - but Al Haines and Anthony Hall share few obvious traits beyond the same initials and a close proximity to the mayor . <p> Haines , chief administrative officer for the city , and Hall , the city attorney , are Brown 's closest advisers . The two share a major influence in running the city and shaping its policy . <p> At times their differences , combined with the mayor 's style of management and the politics at City Hall , have undermined the effectiveness of their stewardship , sources say . <p> Much of the credit of Brown 's administration thus far goes to the key but dissimilar roles played by Haines and Hall . <p> " They certainly bring a creative tension to the process of advancing the mayor 's agenda , " said Councilman Carroll Robinson . " Haines makes it work , Hall has the strategic vision - it 's a synergistic thing . " <p> Those familiar with the trio define the relationship by noting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more closely heeds the advice of Hall . <p> Both Haines and Hall are former longtime city government hands who came back to work for Brown after stints in the private sector . <p> Hall , considered by many to be the more controversial and vituperative of the two , is a former city councilman and transit authority chairman , with more than 18 years in elected or appointed public office . <p> Hall left a lucrative private legal practice to oversee the $ 10.8 million a year city Legal Department , and assume residence as Brown 's chief political adviser and tactical strategist . <p> At the time of his appointment , Hall was widely regarded as just the type Brown needed to navigate his agenda through the increasingly partisan City Hall - someone the stoic and solitary Brown knew from the past and could rely on . <p> But almost immediately , Hall 's manner and methods created strife for the administration , sources say . <p> " I think he misread City Council , " said Councilwoman Annise Parker . " I also think he was trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essentially to be the lawyer for the city . I think trying to be too much of a political operative could ultimately undermine his effectiveness . " <p> More recently , Hall has begun shoring up his relationships with members of City Council by , among other things , taking them to breakfast and soliciting their opinions about the administration . <p> If he succeeds in building trust with members of council , Hall could provide a valuable service that Brown is currently lacking . Dating back to Brown 's inauguration , the constant complaint from council has been a lack of communication from the administration . <p> Hall said he regrets not developing those relationships sooner . <p> " I have to always be mindful that in the hustle and bustle of getting things done that you run the risk of hurting the feelings of folks or of ruffling feathers , " Hall said . " Working with council is part of the role that I should be playing , and I probably had n't done that early enough . " <p> Hall and Haines have known each other for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notably for former Mayor Kathy Whitmire , where Haines was a finance official . <p> The well-regarded Haines is a devout Mormon who said he returned to public service from a high-paying executive job in the private sector because it " seemed like the right thing to do . " <p> When Brown appointed Haines early in his administration , the low-key bureaucrat was widely considered just the administrator the mayor needed to oversee the massive , day-to-day operations of the city . <p> But Brown 's style of management is not strong on delegation . The structure of the mayor 's administration is generally flat , with numerous officials reporting directly to Brown - without much lateral communication among the ranks . <p> " He is more hands-on than I think one would suspect , " Haines said recently of Brown . " He has more than a passing interest in how things are done . " <p> Recently , the lack of communication in the mayor 's administration played a role in an episode that put Haines and Hall in direct and public conflict . <p> During the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Controller Sylvia Garcia in performing comprehensive audits of city departments . <p> The controller and a large faction of council members , led by Councilman Joe Roach , wanted to include Garcia in a series of performance audits planned by the administration . <p> Haines sat down with Roach and the controller 's office and worked out a compromise that would have allowed Garcia a role in the work . <p> Hours later , however , Hall trumped Haines with a legal opinion saying Garcia had no authority to participate in the audits . The dispute erupted at a City Council meeting , where Brown sided with Hall and a stunned Roach complained he thought he had a deal . <p> " I think we were all kind of mystified by that one , " said Parker . <p> Councilman Bruce Tatro cited the episode as a telling indicator of the organizational confusion in the administration . He noted ironically that the controller is now participating in the audits , with the acquiescence of the mayor . <p> " It was really a flip-flop on the mayor 's part . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it turned out , " Tatro said . " It gives great apprehension to council members in negotiating with a department head or a member of the administration , that the rug could be pulled from whatever you thought your agreement was . It does n't give you just a great deal of confidence . " <p> Haines still does not like to discuss the episode over the audits , and asking Hall to recount what went wrong results in a lengthy explanation that seems to boil down to missed communication . <p> " Unfortunately , there was not an opportunity for prior discussion between me and Al , " Hall said . " I think we are going to work it out . " <p> Hall and Haines stress mutual respect and admiration , and they say there is minimal conflict in their relationship . Haines is noted for his dislike of conflict and confrontation , which some regard as a key shortcoming in a chief administrative officer . <p> " Maybe I am a little different today than I was six or 10 years ago , when I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fights , " Haines said . " I am not willing to engage in that kind of behavior now . Some have suggested that is a fundamental weakness of mine . In fact , a couple of former mayors have said so . " <p> Some at City Hall view Haines and Hall as capable lieutenants , stymied by a chief who is stylistically remote and who generally keeps his own counsel . <p> " I think they are eager bystanders , " said Councilman John Castillo . " The administration really does n't communicate with itself . The right hand does n't know what the left hand is doing . " <p> Those in the administration scoff at such characterizations . Jay Aiyer , Brown 's chief of staff , said Haines and Hall offer different perspectives of equal value to the mayor . <p> " From the standpoint of all the policy decisions that have been made here , either one or both of them has had a significant impact , " Aiyer said . " They are like two sides of the same coin . " <p> Inquiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can reveal more about the mayor than about Haines and Hall . <p> Haines , asked whether Brown solicits his advice , said : " Yes , absolutely . " Asked whether Brown followed his advice , Haines laughed and said : " I ask for his advice . " <p> The same question posed to Hall , meanwhile , elicits a slightly different but equally revealing response . <p> " He asks me questions all the time , we talk a lot , " Hall said . " But advice ? He 's never phrased it like that . " <p> Parker , who recently had separate breakfast meetings with Haines and Hall , both of whom she gives high marks , offered a different assessment . " Al gives advice , " she said , " Anthony gives opinions . " <p> Aiyer , meanwhile , occupies his own unique role in Brown 's administration , one that combines Hall 's intensely political style with the policy interests of Haines . <p> Robinson , a longtime friend of Aiyer , referred to the 29-year old chief of staff as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to oversee operations within the mayor 's office , Aiyer has in just a few months taken on a larger and more significant role in the administration . <p> Many speculate Hall returned to City Hall to position himself for another elected office - a claim that Hall denies . Aiyer is fairly open about his interest in running for office someday , while Haines is steadfastly uninterested . <p> All say their primary interest in serving Brown and the city . <p> " The issues come and the issues go , " Haines said . " We can leave with a handshake and the understanding that we did not agree on all things . But next time we meet , it will be with a handshake again . That 's the thing that counts . "
