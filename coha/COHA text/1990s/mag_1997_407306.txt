Slowly but Surely Recovering from a difficult childbirth one day at a time When mom and baby are healthy , expressing disappointment about the labour and birth is often interpreted as ingratitude . As Sheila Kitzinger notes in The Year after Childbirth , " The way in which a woman experiences birth , and the memories with which she is left , may cause grief . This often goes unrecognized and she is supposed to be grateful for having a beautiful baby . " However , there are physical and emotional consequences of a difficult birth , as I discovered after my son was born . Two years later , this is the memory that remains of Nicholas 's first day : Twenty - four hours ago I had my first baby . I have n't seen him yet . As I approach a row of incubators I am crying . I ask my husband , " Which one is he ? " I guess I thought I should know . As I hold him I wonder if he knows I 'm his mom . " The five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency C - section and a lingering haze of medication left me exhausted as I began the adjustment to being a new mother . For months afterward I tried to understand my overwhelming sadness . Although Nicholas was healthy and happy and I loved being at home with him , I wondered , " Why ca n't I get myself together ? " I did n't know at the time , but my experience was shared by other women , as I learned through the letters I received as a result of my listing in the Today 's Parent Pen Pals section . I felt like a failure , " wrote Kim Bark - well of Bittern Lake , Alta . " Women all around me were having babies and I was getting nowhere . " " I am still haunted by my experience , " said Laura Blanco of St. Laurent , Que . " My heart sank because I wanted us to see our child being born . It tore me apart , " said Jennifer Firman of Kincardine , Ont . And Michele ( who asked that her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ache inside when I see pictures of mothers with their babies right after birth . I am still very angry about what happened . " In my own case , I asked to see the medical chart for my birth and asked my gynecologist to answer my questions about what happened and why . Subsequently , therapy helped me to see that the tears , anger and guilt were all normal reactions after a traumatic birth . Kitzinger 's book offers a number of suggestions , including : Talk to someone who is willing listen reflectively  --  possibly a childbirth educator or another mother ; Join a discussion or support group for new mothers ; Draw , paint or write about your experience . Acknowledging what we have lost is but a beginning , yet it is an important beginning , " say authors Claudia Panuthos and Catherine Romeo in Ended Beginnings : Healing Childbearing Losses .
