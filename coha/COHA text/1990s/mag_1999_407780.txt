Like an impresario , TED COHEN creates drama on public and private stages . Objects are the actors and lighting an essential ingredient . // IT WAS JUST TWO DAYS BEFORE THE OPENING of " Expressions in Wood : Masterworks from the Wornick Collection " at the American Craft Museum in January 1998 , but the exhibition designer Theodore Cohen , whose task it was to create the look , atmosphere and flow of the show , was the picture of serenity and good humor as he supervised the crew installing 6i turned wood objects . Having flown to New York for this job from his home base in Oakland , California-where he 'd previously designed the Wornick show for its run at the Oakland Museum-Cohen seemed totally in his element , the calm center of the storm . Moving easily amid the confusion of ladders , boxes , pedestals and vessels , he fine-tuned lighting ( it was to be " very dramatic , " to give the mostly small objects an intimate , almost precious setting in the two galleries adjoining the museum 's soaring atrium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When an artist has more than one piece in the show , should they be next to each other ? " Not always . It depends on the size . " ) , and dealt coolly and efficiently with various last-minute changes and mini-crises . Though he has been doing this for some 4o years , " I never tire of it , " he remarked . " Each show dictates how it should be set up . It 's always fresh . " A connoisseur 's eye , a quietly commanding presence , grace under pressure-by all accounts , this was vintage Ted Cohen . Such qualities have eamed him a reputation as one of the country 's most respected exhibition designers , along with the affection of the San Francisco Bay Area art community , where his gift for displaying and living with art-particularly craft objects-is legendary . As one local photographer succinctly puts it , " Ted makes everything look good . " " Ted 's never really separated his art and his business . He 's always been steeped in art , " says his friend Kenneth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cohen honed his skills during a 27-year tenure ( 1959-86 ) as designer at the Oakland Museum , where he was responsible for installing hundreds of exhibitions , covering history and science as well as art . " He was creating designs that included tools , skulls , grass specimens-you name it , he was asked to display it , " says Trapp , who worked with him there as curator of decorative arts in the os . " What that does is , it forces a really creative designer to think spatially . And Ted is a good designer because he has the innate quality to think spatially . He makes it seem so effortless , but that 's the consummate professional in him . " He really is a master . He 's especially good with three-dimensional pieces-maybe because he truly loves them , understands them , in terms of what he collects , " notes the fiber artist Kay Sekimachi , another longtime friend . " Ted is an artist , " says the San Francisco businessman and prominent craft collector George Saxe , adding , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a great eye . He has a way of putting it together that is beyond compare . He makes it come alive . " For Cohen , the art of display is essentially intuitive . " I find it really difficult to express why I do something . I do it instinctively at this point , and I think I always did , in a sense , " he muses . " I just know it 's right , or not right , and I ca n't explain why . You can learn design , space , color-but not how to put it all together . It either works or it does n't . " Disinclined himself to wax philosophical about his work , he instead cites a favorite quote , from the autobiography of Sir Kenneth Clark , the art historian : " From childhood onward , hanging pictures has been my favorite occupation . It has been a substitute for being a painter and a concrete illustration of my feelings as a critic . It is a curious art . One never knows what pictures are going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placid babies passing each other in their prams , they may either stretch out their arms in longing or scream with rage .

OPPOSITE PAGE : Mnemosyne by Beadle . // Nothing in Cohen 's childhood prepared him for a life in art , except maybe being deprived of it . He was born and raised in Oakland , an only child . " We never collected anything , never went to museums , " he recalls . The family 's modest house was never decorated-nothing , nothing . " He always liked art , however , and following army service , attended the California College of Arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student painter he made his first attempt at interior design . " I said , ' Oh , Mother , you need to redo . ' So I painted nudes on a wall . I remember this vividly , because her neighbors almost had a heart attack , and the next time I came home it was all painted over . " Soon after graduating , in 1952 , Cohen realized he lacked the dedication to be a painter , and began doing retail display for a major furniture store , good basic training for his later creative work . ( " I mean , it 's all show biz . You know , you put it up and you take it down and you create this theme . But it 's the same kind of thing-basically , to enhance the object . " ) Then he heard of an opening at the Oakland Museum for a preparator , a job that generally involves helping curators to prepare work for display . To qualify for a post at this municipal museum , Cohen took the civil service exam , . which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What would you do if someone fainted in the gallery ? ' I decided I did n't need this , and I did n't finish the exam and walked out . About three weeks later I get this card saying I 'm one of the top three scoring people . Anyway , I was hired . " Having drifted into a career . Cohen flourished , advancing to chief preparator and ultimately museum designer . He had found both his calling and the perfect time and place in which to cultivate it . Today installation design is a specialized field , with college courses increasingly offered as part of art or museum studies . Back then it was a job almost exclusively done by curators , for which no formal training existed . The early years at Oakland served as Cohen 's apprenticeship . " We did a new exhibition every three weeks , which was pretty incredible . We had absolutely no money and I had no staff , so I did everything from sweeping the floors to doing the lights . It really was a leaming experience . Starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do and just doing it , helped . You learned certain rules as you went along-lighting , materials , handling objects with gloves . But in the beginning we paid attention to none of that . We just did it , because there was no one there to tell you no , you could n't . " As the Bay Area art scene burgeoned in the 1960s and 70s , Cohen worked with and befriended many of the most influential names in craft-Ed Rossbach , Katherine Westphal , Robert Arneson , Peter Voulkos , Marvin Lipofsky , Garry Knox Bennett , Lia Cook and Bob Stocksdale , to name a few . Kay Sekimachi has a clear memory of their first meeting in 1963 , around the time she began doing monofilament hangings , which were a challenge to install . " I got a call from Ted , " she laughs , " and he said , You 'd better get down here . Your form is sagging . ' ' " These days Cohen is busier and in greater demand than ever as an independent designer . He installs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art centers and consults to numerous private and corporate collectors , accommodating a range of budgets , tastes and purposes . Though possessed of a strong vision , he is famously easy to work with . " He 's very calm and calming and reassuring , uncommonly generous , " says Trapp . " I would always say my requirements were that he should come in under budget and on time , and make me look good . He 'd say , " Fne , I can do that . ' ' " Cohen sketches his original design for a project at the diningroom table of his tiny , art-filled apartment , factoring in such givens as square footage and ceiling height , required light levels , size and number of works , and any educational components . " I like shows that have historical perspective , that go into the depth of pieces , " he says . From there emerges the overall scheme of walls , platforms , pedestals , cases and labels that will ideally show the works to best advantage and subtly guide the viewer through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " To me it does n't matter whether it 's a little hand-thrown clay vessel or the Mona Usa . This whole thing about craft and art-I mean , it 's so ridiculous " ) , objects are his favorites , though he considers them much more difficult to display than paintings . " Most three-dimensional objects should be seen in the round . You ca n't always do that when you 've got a small room and a hundred objects you have to somehow put together . You try to make relationships , so that each piece looks good . " Part of Cohen 's talent , Trapp says , is his ability to visualize a show in space as well as plot it on paper : " He can take something threedimensional , transfer it to two dimensions , take it back to three dimensions and have it come out the way he wanted it Trapp recalls of their collaboration at the Oakland Museum , " We both like clean design , and prefer the design to take a backdrop to what 's being shown , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's memorable shows of the 8os was the George and Dorothy Saxe collection of contemporary glass , which Trapp and Cohen had the luxury of planning from concept to realization . " We had 56 objects in 3 , ooo square feet . Ted worked it so that you could pause as you went through . It was lit for the sense of drama the pieces suggested . It was visually rich and seductive . it would draw you in , " Trapp recalls . In fact , Cohen considers glass the hardest medium to install , " only because if you do n't have the right lighting system , you can really lose it . Glass needs to be lit brilliantly , because of the facets . Also , I 'm very conscious of shadows-a great part of showing any work , but glass specifically , because you can throw wonderful visions on the wall , and that 's part of the piece . You can do magic . " Jewelry also can be tough : " The best way , of course , is to wear it-to show how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hangs . " Cohen most enjoys working with wood and fiber , responding to their warm , organic qualities . " Fiber should not be directly against a wall , " he says . " It 's a living , breathing thing . So even if only a half an inch , it needs to come out . " For any medium or setting , Cohen stresses , lighting is key . " To me , that 's where you should put your money . You can make or break whatever you 're showing by the kind of light you use . ' He also uses color to highlight an effect or create a mood ; for a recent retrospective of the enamel vessels and plaques of June Schwarcz at the San Francisco Craft &; Folk Art Museum , he painted the walls a dark peach to bring out the work 's subtle jewel tones . For the Palo Alto Cultural Center 's retrospective of mixed-media constructions by Dominic Di Mare , a fisherman 's son whose works allude to lures , netting and the like , he chose blue-gray to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empathy for artists helps him to be diplomatic when they become involved in the installation process . " A lot of times artists , I find , are too close to their work . They do n't have a perspective . They 're hovering over you , because they want it to be right . So I say , ' Listen , if I can , I 'm going to take your object and make it as nice as I can . Trust me . ' And the bigger the artist-the more important , I should say-the more I think they respect that . " Interestingly , when asked to describe his dream project , Cohen mentions Lenore Tawney , whose own brilliance at arranging objects is so much a part of her art . " I just love her kind of sensibility , and I would hope to create an installationthe way she would want it to be created . That 's always the challenge for a designer , to have your input but at the same time her input is more important than your input . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance . In Tawney 's case , he concludes , " the trouble is , I would hope that she could do it herself , because she would know exactly how it should look . " Lately much of Cohen 's work is for private clients , ranging from a collector of conceptual art ( " not the easiest thing " ) to an architect with a new , all-aluminum house , to people who seek help editing their collections . In a residence , he tries not to isolate art-after all , " you live with this , and you want to integrate it somehow . " Occasionally he gives a slide lecture on how to display artifacts in the home . ( Among his tips : Hang things low , so they can be appreciated from a sitting position . Change things around , lest you stop really seeing them ; to make it easy , lean them on shelves , floors or easels . ) An avid acquirer himself ( he recently donated 24 pieces to the Renwick ) , Cohen is currently into , among other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " they are wonderful architecturally , just fabulous . " Friends describe his apartment as a delight to the eye , chock-full of marvelous things , immaculately arranged . " I live in a very small place , and I love stuff , and I like to have it all out . Which makes it difficult . So you do have to organize without going crazy , otherwise you ca n't see anything . " Arranging environments is Ted Cohen 's passion but not , he says , his obsession . " When I go to a restaurant , I 'm always sitting facing the picture that 's crooked . I have to go up and straighten it , which is absolutely terrible to do . But I do n't try to rearrange the world . You ca n't do that . And I love stuff , he repeats . " I do n't mind all this stuff crowded together in the kitchen and everything else . That 's fine . I do n't look and say , " Oh , God , it should be this way . ' Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . " Photograph " In the San Francisco condominium of Dorothy and George Saxe , which is not their main residence , I saw the space as a changing museum environment . The platforms , pedestals and wall shelves-all in neutral tones-and the flexible lighting system easily adapt to new acquisitions and arrangements . " Photograph " Having the opportunity to work with Rita and Robert Roberts while their Sonoma residence was being built and knowing many of the objects in their collection allowed advance planning to assure proper lighting for groups of objects and the placement of larger art works in relation to the movement of people within the space . The client 's wish to have the potential to rearrange works without undue havoc was also a factor in the placement of the collection . " Photograph " A varied and extensive collection of craft objects coexist within Anita and Ron Wornick 's airy compound in St. Helena . By interspersing groups of small works or those of like material with larger pieces , I sought to achieve a look that neither overwhelms nor clutters the environment More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very smnll place , and I love stuff , and I like to have it all out , " is Ted Cohen 's apt description of his personal environment . // <p>
