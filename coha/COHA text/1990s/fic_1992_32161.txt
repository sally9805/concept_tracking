1 A PARTING &lt;Today one of the brothers asked me : Is it a terrible prison , not to be able to move from the place where you 're standing ? &gt; &lt;You answered ... &gt; &lt;I told him that I am now more free than he is . The inability to move frees me from the obligation to act . &gt; &lt;You who speak languages , you are such liars . &gt; * * * Han Fei-tzu sat in lotus position on the bare wooden floor beside his wife 's sickbed . Until a moment ago he might have been sleeping ; he was n't sure . But now he was aware of the slight change in her breathing , a change as subtle as the wind from a butterfly 's passing . Jiang-qing , for her part , must also have detected some change in him , for she had not spoken before and now she did speak . Her voice was very soft . But Han Fei-tzu could hear her clearly , for the house was silent . He had asked his friends and servants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time enough for careless noise during the long night that was to come , when there would be no hushed words from her lips . " Still not dead , " she said . She had greeted him with these words each time she woke during the past few days . At first the words had seemed whimsical or ironic to him , but now he knew that she spoke with disappointment . She longed for death now , not because she had n't loved life , but because death was nowunavoidable , and what can not be shunned must be embraced . That was the Path . Jiang-qing had never taken a step away from the Path in her life . " Then the gods are kind to me , " said Han Fei-tzu . " To you , " she breathed . " What do we contemplate ? " It was her way of asking him to share his private thoughts with her . When others asked his private thoughts , he felt spied upon . But Jiang-qing asked only so that she could also think the same thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul . " We are contemplating the nature of desire , " said Han Fei-tzu . " Whose desire ? " she asked . " And for what ? " My desire for your bones to heal and become strong , so that they do n't snap at the slightest pressure . So that you could stand again , or even raise an arm without your own muscles tearing away chunks of bone or causing the bone to break under the tension . So that I would n't have to watch you wither away until now you weigh only eighteen kilograms . I never knew how perfectly happy we were until I learned that we could not stay together . " My desire , " he answered . " For you . " " ' You only covet what you do not have . ' Who said that ? " " You did , " said Han Fei-tzu . " Some say , ' what you can not have . ' Others say , ' what you should not have . ' I say , ' You can truly covet only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have me forever . " " I will lose you tonight . Or tomorrow . Or next week . " " Let us contemplate the nature of desire , " said Jiang-qing . As before , she was using philosophy to pull him out of his brooding melancholy . He resisted her , but only playfully . " You are a harsh ruler , " said Han Fei-tzu . " Like your ancestor-of-the-heart , you make no allowance for other people 's frailty . " Jiang-qing was named for a revolutionary leader of the ancient past , who had tried to lead the people onto a new Path but was overthrown by weak-hearted cowards . It was not right , thought Han Fei-tzu , for his wife to die before him : her ancestor-of-the-heart had outlived her husband . Besides , wives should live longer than husbands . Women were more complete inside themselves . They were also better at living in their children . They were never as solitary as a man alone . Jiang-qing refused to let him return to brooding . " When a man 's wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rebelliously , Han Fei-tzu gave her the most false answer to her question . " To lie with her , " he said . " The desire of the body , " said Jiang-qing . Since she was determined to have this conversation , Han Fei-tzu took up the catalogue for her . " The desire of the body is to act . It includes all touches , casual and intimate , and all customary movements . Thus he sees a movement out of the corner of his eye , and thinks he has seen his dead wife moving across the doorway , and he can not be content until he has walked to the door and seen that it was not his wife . Thus he wakes up from a dream in which he heard her voice , and finds himself speaking his answer aloud as if she could hear him . " " What else ? " asked Jiang-qing . " I 'm tired of philosophy , " said Han Fei-tzu . " Maybe the Greeks found comfort in it , but not me . " " The desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Because the spirit is of the earth , it is that part which makes new things out of old ones . The husband longs for all the unfinished things that he and his wife were making when she died , and all the unstarted dreams of what they would have made if she had lived . Thus a man grows angry at his children for being too much like him and not enough like his dead wife . Thus a man hates the house they lived in together , because either he does not change it , so that it is as dead as his wife , or because he does change it , so that it is no longer half of her making . " " You do n't have to be angry at our little Qing-jao , " said Jiang-qing . " Why ? " asked Han Fei-tzu . " Will you stay , then , and help me teach her to be a woman ? All I can teach her is to be what I am -- cold and hard , sharp and strong , like obsidian . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you , how can I help but be angry ? " " Because you can teach her everything that I am , too , " said Jiang-qing . " If I had any part of you in me , " said Han Fei-tzu , " I would not have needed to marry you to become a complete person . " Now he teased her by using philosophy to turn the conversation away from pain . " That is the desire of the soul . Because the soul is made of light and dwells in air , it is that part which conceives and keeps ideas , especially the idea of the self . The husband longs for his whole self , which was made of the husband and wife together . Thus he never believes any of his own thoughts , because there is always a question in his mind to which his wife 's thoughts were the only possible answer . Thus the whole world seems dead to him because he can not trust anything to keep its meaning before the onslaught of this unanswerable question . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were Japanese I would commit seppuku , spilling my bowel into the jar of your ashes . " " Very wet and messy , " she said . He smiled . " Then I should be an ancient Hindu , and burn myself on your pyre . " But she was through with joking . " Qing-jao , " she whispered . She was reminding him he could do nothing so flamboyant as to die with her . There was little Qing-jao to care for . So Han Fei-tzu answered her seriously . " How can I teach her to be what you are ? " " All that is good in me , " said Jiang-qing , " comes from the Path . If you teach her to obey the gods , honor the ancestors , love the people , and serve the rulers , I will be in her as much as you are . " " I would teach her the Path as part of myself , " said Han Fei-tzu . " Not so , " said Jiang-qing . " The Path is not a natural part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking to you every day , you insist on believing in a world where everything can be explained by natural causes . " " I obey the gods . " He thought , bitterly , that he had no choice ; that even to delay obedience was torture . " But you do n't know them . You do n't love their works . " " The Path is to love the people . The gods we only obey . " How can I love gods who humiliate me and torment me at every opportunity ? " We love the people because they are creatures of the gods . " " Do n't preach to me . " She sighed . Her sadness stung him like a spider . " I wish you would preach to me forever , " said Han Fei-tzu . " You married me because you knew I loved the gods , and that love for them was completely missing from yourself . That was how I completed you . " How could he argue with her , when he knew that even now he hated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything they had ever made him do , everything they had stolen from him in his life . " Promise me , " said Jiang-qing . He knew what these words meant . She felt death upon her ; she was laying the burden of her life upon him . A burden he would gladly bear . It was losing her company on the Path that he had dreaded for so long . " Promise that you will teach Qing-jao to love the gods and walk always on the Path . Promise that you will make her as much my daughter as yours . " " Even if she never hears the voice of the gods ? " " The Path is for everyone , not just the godspoken . " Perhaps , thought Han Fei-tzu , but it was much easier for the godspoken to follow the Path , because to them the price for straying from it was so terrible . The common people were free ; they could leave the Path and not feel the pain of it for years . The godspoken could n't leave the Path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will . I promise . But he could n't say the words out loud . He did not know why , but his reluctance was deep . In the silence , as she waited for his vow , they heard the sound of running feet on the gravel outside the front door of the house . It could only be Qing-jao , home from the garden of Sun Cao-pi . Only Qing-jao was allowed to run and make noise during this time of hush . They waited , knowing that she would come straight to her mother 's room . The door slid open almost noiselessly . Even Qing-jao had caught enough of the hush to walk softly when she was actually in the presence of her mother . Though she walked on tiptoe , she could hardly keep from dancing , almost galloping across the floor . But she did not fling her arms around her mother 's neck ; she remembered that lesson even though the terrible bruise had faded from Jiang-qing 's face , where Qing-jao 's eager embrace had broken her jaw three months ago . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Qing-jao . " So many , " said Jiang-qing . " I think they were showing themselves to me , " said Qing-jao . " So I could count them . None of them wanted to be left out . " " Love you , " whispered Jiang-qing . Han Fei-tzu heard a new sound in her breathy voice -- a popping sound , like bubbles bursting with her words . " Do you think that seeing so many carp means that I will be godspoken ? " asked Qing-jao . " I will ask the gods to speak to you , " said Jiang-qing . Suddenly Jiang-qing 's breathing became quick and harsh . Han Fei-tzu immediately knelt and looked at his wife . Her eyes were wide and frightened . The moment had come . Her lips moved . Promise me , she said , though her breath could make no sound but gasping . " I promise , " said Han Fei-tzu . Then her breathing stopped . " What do the gods say when they talk to you ? " asked Qing-jao . " Your mother is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should go out now . " " But she did n't answer me . What do the gods say ? " " They tell secrets , " said Han Fei-tzu . " No one who hears will repeat them . " Qing-jao nodded wisely . She took a step back , as if to leave , but stopped . " May I kiss you , Mama ? " " Lightly on the cheek , " said Han Fei-tzu . Qing-jao , being small for a four-year-old , did not have to bend very far at all to kiss her mother 's cheek . " I love you , Mama . " " You 'd better leave now , Qing-jao , " said Han Fei-tzu . " But Mama did n't say she loved me too . " " She did . She said it before . Remember ? But she 's very tired and weak . Go now . " He put just enough sternness in his voice that Qing-jao left without further questions . Only when she was gone did Han Fei-tzu let himself feel anything but care for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine what was happening to her now . Her soul had flown and was now already in heaven . Her spirit would linger much longer ; perhaps her spirit would dwell in this house , if it had truly been a place of happiness for her . Superstitious people believed that all spirits of the dead were dangerous , and put up signs and wards to fend them off . But those who followed the Path knew that the spirit of a good person was never harmful or destructive , for their goodness in life had come from the spirit 's love of making things . Jiang-qing 's spirit would be a blessing in the house for many years to come , if she chose to stay . Yet even as he tried to imagine her soul and spirit , according to the teachings of the Path , there was a cold place in his heart that was certain that all that was left of Jiang-qing was this brittle , dried-up body . Tonight it would burn as quickly as paper , and then she would be gone except for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to complete his soul , he was already doubting the gods . And the gods had noticed -- they always did . At once he felt the unbearable pressure to do the ritual of cleansing , until he was rid of his unworthy thoughts . Even now they could not leave him unpunished . Even now , with his wife lying dead before him , the gods insisted that he do obeisance to them before he could shed a single tear of grief for her . At first he meant to delay , to put off obedience . He had schooled himself to be able to postpone the ritual for as long as a whole day , while hiding all outward signs of his inner torment . He could do that now -- but only by keeping his heart utterly cold . There was no point in that . Proper grief could come only when he had satisfied the gods . So , kneeling there , he began the ritual . He was still twisting and gyrating with the ritual when a servant peered in . Though the servant said nothing , Han Fei-tzu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the servant would assume : Jiang-qing was dead , and Han Fei-tzu was so righteous that he was communing with the gods even before he announced her death to the household . No doubt some would even suppose that the gods had come to take Jiang-qing , since she was known for her extraordinary holiness . No one would guess that even as Han Fei-tzu worshiped , his heart was full of bitterness that the gods would dare demand this of him even now . O Gods , he thought , if I knew that by cutting off an arm or cutting out my liver I could be rid of you forever , I would seize the knife and relish the pain and loss , all for the sake of freedom . That thought , too , was unworthy , and required even more cleansing . It was hours before the gods at last released him , and by then he was too tired , too sick at heart to grieve . He got up and fetched the women to prepare Jiang-qing 's body for the burning . At midnight he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sleepy Qing-jao in his arms . She clutched in her hands the three papers she had written for her mother in her childish scrawl . " Fish , " she had written , and " book " and " secrets . " These were the things that Qing-jao was giving to her mother to carry with her into heaven . Han Fei-tzu had tried to guess at the thoughts in Qing-jao 's mind as she wrote those words . Fish because of the carp in the garden stream today , no doubt . And book -- that was easy enough to understand , because reading aloud was one of the last things Jiang-qing could do with her daughter . But why secrets ? What secrets did Qing-jao have for her mother ? He could not ask . One did not discuss the paper offerings to the dead . Han Fei-tzu set Qing-jao on her feet ; she had not been deeply asleep , and so she woke at once and stood there , blinking slowly . Han Fei-tzu whispered to her and she rolled her papers and tucked them into her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother 's cold flesh -- she was too young to have learned to shudder at the touch of death . Nor did Han Fei-tzu mind the touch of his wife 's flesh as he tucked his own three papers into her other sleeve . What was there to fear from death now , when it had already done its worst ? No one knew what was written on his papers , or they would have been horrified , for he had written , " My body , " " My spirit , " and " My soul . " Thus it was that he burned himself on Jiang-qing 's funeral pyre , and sent himself with her wherever it was she was going . Then Jiang-qing 's secret maid , Mu-pao , laid the torch onto the sacred wood and the pyre burst into flames . The heat of the fire was painful , and Qing-jao hid herself behind her father , only peeking around him now and then to watch her mother leave on her endless journey . Han Fei-tzu , though , welcomed the dry heat that seared his skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body had not been as dry as it seemed ; long after the papers had crisped into ash and blown upward into the smoke of the fire , her body still sizzled , and the heavy incense burning all around the fire could not conceal from him the smell of burning flesh . That is what we 're burning here : meat , fish , carrion , nothing . Not my Jiang-qing . Only the costume she wore into this life . That which made that body into the woman that I loved is still alive , must still live . And for a moment he thought he could see , or hear , or somehow feel the passage of Jiang-qing . Into the air , into the earth , into the fire . I am with you . Continues ...
