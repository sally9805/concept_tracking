The private elevator leading to the fiftieth floor of Smith Barney 's New York midtown office reeks of good old boys and old money : hushed , sedately opulent , mahogany paneling bordered by deep , plush carpeting the color of pine trees in winter . The Black woman who steps off the elevator , however , is clearly no one 's good old boy  --  or old girl , for that matter . Her chic mink swing coat is open , showing a soft ivory wrap skirt that 's topped with a matching silk blouse , chain belt , gold beads . Her long hair is brushed back , flowing . Her make-up and smile are perfect . Meet deal maker Marianne Spraggins , managing director of Smith Barney , Harris Upham &; Co. ' s public-finance division . The highest-ranked Black woman on Wall Street . The first and only African-American woman to become a managing director in the rough-and-tumble and enormously lucrative field of investment banking . A winning player in an elite and previously all-white and all-male capitalist class : the rarefied world of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " novelist Tom Wolfe called them in Bonfire of the Vanities , though , of course , Marianne Spraggins is not exactly who he had in mind . But do n't let the high-style image fool you . Spraggins is one focused sister : charming but tough ; pleasant but persistent ; tenacious , savvy and , above all , very , very smart . In a business where the smallest deal starts at about $100 million and the largest can go up to $2 billion , Spraggins knows it 's not about flash and dash . " People used to think that Blacks would be dangerous if we ever learned to read , " she says . " But I always knew we 'd be really dangerous when we learned to count . " Marianne Spraggins is really dangerous . A lawyer by training and tradition  --  her father and grandfather were also lawyers  --  Spraggins was attracted to Wall Street , she explains , because it represents where the real power is in America . " I wanted to cross new thresholds for us Black people , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place at America 's bargaining table . Wall Street is the engine that drives our economy  --  the ultimate power base . I wanted to see what it was all about , and I figured that if I ever wanted to have it , or be a part of it , I had to be where it was . " After a stint teaching law at the New York Law School ( where she got her law degree ; she also has a master 's degree in law from Harvard ) , Spraggins joined Salomon Brothers , Inc. , in the go-go investment-banking years of the early eighties . She spent eight years there , working in the mortgage area , " a very marvelous place to be lucky enough to cut my teeth . " Selling mortgages as security instruments was a brand-new concept on Wall Street at the time Spraggins joined Salomon Brothers . " Not only was I new to the whole field of investment banking , but I was also working in a pioneer area , " she says . Yet within four years Spraggins was heading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved into public finance at Salomon Brothers , the arena that raises money for local , state and federal projects . So what exactly do investment bankers do ? And why are they paid so much ? Basically an investment banker ( or investment banking house ) raises money for institutions , be they private corporations or public entities such as state or local municipalities , through what 's known as a public offering . This simply means the public  --  financial institutions or individual investors  --  is given an opportunity either to invest in a company ( through purchasing its stocks ) or to lend money to a municipality ( through purchasing its bonds ) . In either case , capital is raised to finance anything from the construction of a new bridge to building a major airport . The skill an investment banker brings to underwriting or putting together the financing package that raises the desired capital is what separates the movers from the shaken . In a commission-driven business , this skill is literally worth millions . A typical $100 million offering results in huge profits for both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who works on the deal . According to Spraggins , there are perhaps 15 major investment banks that do public financing . " My job is to make sure that Smith Barney is perceived as the best , " she says . Spraggins herself is clearly perceived as one of the best . It is estimated that Spraggins , at her managing-director level , makes a large six-figure income . Yet the sum of the profits is also a source of stress . It is precisely because the stakes are so high and the potential for wealth so vast that Wall Street has remained a block largely closed to Blacks and women . It 's a territory that is fiercely competitive , highly susceptible to burnout and continually ulcer-producing . " This is one of the most difficult environments anyone could ever work in , " Spraggins concedes . " It is not a business for the thin-skinned or weak at heart . Money is at risk every day , every single moment of the day . Even if you start out white , male , WASP , went to Exeter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman of Exxon , it 's going to be hard . " What does this say , then , about the chances of a Black female from Harlem making it ? If she 's a third-generation lawyer who grew up with a father and grandfather who gave her an understanding of politics and power , as well as a strong sense of herself and her own potential , she is more than likely to succeed . As a Black person and a woman , she is also certain to encounter resistance , which means any success she achieves is due to hey being exceedingly good at what she does . " One of the reasons I chose this field as an African-American , " Spraggins explains , " is that I wanted to do something that was very quantifiable . I did n't want to rely on whether or not people liked me or thought I was the right " fit . " I wanted to say " This is what I 've done . And this is what I can do for you . ' ' " Spraggins acknowledges that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both Black and white . Now divorced , she has no children and handles the stress that comes with her profession by maintaining a firm commitment to exercising . Not only has her regimen kept her five-foot , seven-inch body a perfect size six , but it has also kept her emotionally centered . For about a week a couple of times a year she disappears altogether to a spa to unwind . " I learn about cleansing and focus and energy and being a whole person , " she says of what she calls " my little cures for a high-stress business . " Creativity and common sense are the very skills Spraggins says women bring to the game on Wall Street . " It takes more than good luck , good looks and great contacts to make it , " says Patricia Winans , head of Magna Investment Group , Inc. , in New York , the first brokerage firm owned by an African-American woman . " It takes an understanding of sophisticated financing techniques , the creativity to structure complex deals and skill in closing them . Marianne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hot . " But even the most savvy deal maker needs to cool out . One of the ways Spraggins relaxes is by collecting African sculpture and Haitian art to adorn the peach-colored walls of her sprawling Art Deco-style apartment . On a Saturday afternoon , as the sun streams through the panoramic windows of Spraggins 's living room , she holds up a sleek designer jacket , admiring its lines . " The last thing I want to look like is typical Wall Street , " she says . " I think the power look is a bunch of nonsense . Power comes from inside out .
