It 's old and there 's no funding , so the Russian Space Agency ca n't keep space station Mir aloft . We asked those versed in the ways of space , " What would you do with Mir ? " <P> " I would turn the Mir space station into a prison in which we would place criminals who are convicted of crimes against humanity . Their sentence is not only isolation in space , but they would be forced to look down on earth to see how interdependent humans are on each other . "  --  William Shatner , actor , Star Trek <P> " We probably would not do anything with the Mir . It does not fit the mission profile for tourists in space . Our mission plan is to provide the tourist with an artificial-gravity environment by spinning the facility . If you do that on the Mir , it falls apart .  --  Gregory Bennett , V.P. , Bigelow Aerospace , a firm developing space cruises and hotels <P> " The Mir has far exceeded expectations in 13 years . It should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be devoted to international space stations ... The thing is bound to wear out , and that could be catastrophic if it was manned . "  --  Pete Conrad , astronaut and CEO of Universal Space Lines , a start-up space airline
