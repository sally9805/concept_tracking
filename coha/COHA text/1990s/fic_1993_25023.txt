That same day the Amarillos had a visit from the one person whom Sara had been petrified of all through her childhood : Tio Yosef , her grandfather 's brother , who was known as " The-Messiah-Is-Coming " because of the way he glowingly greeted everyone . Otherwise he seemed normal , but Sara and Ofra were sure he was out of his mind . He made fruit wines and brought them as gifts , sweet , underaged wine that unripely puckered the mouth . " The Messiah is coming , Sara , " he welcomed her with a friendly smile . " He 's on his way . " She stood there in the doorway , shaking like a bird . " Kiss Tio Yosef 's hand , " said Gracia .

" Tfu , tfu , no tienes any shame ! Ask God for forgiveness , pronto , so that He does n't hold it against you . " There was no one to ask for advice but Tia Victoria . When Sara walked in , Victoria was sitting on the sofa , wearing a flowery kimono cut low over her ample bosom , surrounded by scraps and long triangles of fabric . The seamstress had come for a fitting . Cigarette ashes were scattered all over the floor wherever the fabric left room . " iPustema grande ! " Victoria said to the seamstress . " I swear , you have to be a pustema to make it so tight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who do you think I am , Mae West ? I 've got good meat on me , sweetheart , just look what a pata !

She pokes around and around and then starts her Victoria , do n't smoke so much , Victoria , you drink too much coffee , Victoria , you have to go on a diet . She kills me .

" " Chapachula , " said the seamstress , wiping tears of laughter from her eyes . " What a mess ! Here , try on the top .

Sara 's aunt  | shook her huge frame like jelly and roared , imitating the street vendor below : " A penny , a penny , get it all for a penny , the owner 's gone to the loony bin ! " " Pipe down , " begged the seamstress . " In a minute I 'll swallow a pin . " Victoria lifted her two great breasts in her hands with a look of perfect contempt : " Two for a penny , two for a penny , they 're not so new anymore ! " They finally finished the fitting . The seamstress retired to the next room to drone away on her sewing machine . " Now have some tea and tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hard time ? Your grandmother ?

Look , Sarika , how do you expect me to give you advice ? If I tell you to follow your heart , you 'll end up like your father who broke everyone else 's . If I tell you , God forbid you should do anything , you 'll be like your mother , who could n't stand to let Zaki near her even before he started up with his countess , Mademoiselle de la Merde .

So what should I tell you , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drank some tea and asked : " So it 's true that in the end you ca n't stop ? " But Victoria was through philosophizing and in a clownish mood again . She grabbed a large piece of fabric from the floor , took hold of Sara , and began to sing an Arab debka , twirling the cloth around her finger like the handkerchief used in the dance :  | " Ta-la-la-la , never stop , never stop ! Ta-la-la-la , never stop , never stop , no ! Ta-la-la-la , never stop ! " The seamstress stuck her head through the door and yelled : " I do n't care if you pay me a thousand pounds , this is the last time I do anything for you ! " She and Matti clung to each other in out-of-the-way places for a whole year , he more frightened than she . She stuck to him , would n't let him go , with a persistence that puzzled even her .

" Sari , if you do n't keep away from me there 's going to be trouble . " " Coward . " " Sarika , I 'm throwing you out , fast . " Until one day in Mr. Hankes 's cellar , among the barrels of wine , to which she 'd descended after him , by the damp wall , amid the heavy red smell , he could n't hold himself in any longer . " Do n't be afraid , Sari , " he panted as soon as he could . " Nothing 's happened to you . You 're still a virgin .

Gracia came to a decision .  | " Ofra , you 're small and pretty , like my side of the family . You 'll stay home and take care of your looks . You , Sara , you 're too big . Like Victoria . Como todos los Amarillos . You 'd better go find yourself a job . "  | DR . HEINZ B A R Z E L came to Jerusalem roundaboutly . Having heard in his native town of Frankfurt am Main that the palastinisches Klimat was a hot and rigorous Klimat , and being of a scientific turn of mind , he decided first to accustom himself to great heat . Where was such heat to be found ? The young doctor made inquiries and was told that the hottest place on earth where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gulf . Dr. Heinz Barzel set out for Bandar Abbas , where he lived in a hotel room with a ceiling covered by a gigantic fan whose blades stretched from wall to wall . Even this , however , did n't help very much , so that he found himself showering approximately every quarter of an hour in dust-colored , rust-flavored water . The first time he went to the marketplace , he noticed that the merchants of Bandar Abbas spent the hottest part of the day seated in barrels of water , from which they emerged only to wait on customers . The heat was n't heat anymore : it was the spiteful protest of city , stone , sky , Gulf , oil wells , everything , against the presence of the invader from Frankfurt am Main with carrot-red hair and a violin in an aluminum case . Everything con-  | spired against him . Slipping easily under the netting that he hung up at night , the mosquitoes mockingly informed him of his imminent eviction . Scientist that he was , Dr. Barzel wrote home of his impressions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered in Bandar Abbas the probable source of the legend of Ali Baba and his forty thieves who hid in barrels . The tale undoubtedly derives from local folklore , since the merchants here hide in barrels from the heat . I should especially like to call the attention of my friend Professor Reichenbach to this fact . As for my violin , the aluminum case was apparently a serious miscalculation , for the strings have all snapped , the bridge is now warped , and the wood looks rather parboiled . My Organismus is still not entirely adjusted , but as of last Thursday the intervals between my showers have increased from one quarter to one half of every hour . " From Bandar Abbas he proceeded to Abadan and from there to Kuwait . One way or another , the emirs and sheikhs of the Gulf found out that the famous man of learning , Dr. Barzel , was among them , and began to request his services . Oil had yet to be discovered along the west side of the Gulf , and the Arab coast especially was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The young doctor was summoned to harems throughout the region , where the local sheikh 's mother , wives , daughters , aunts , and female cousins stood waiting in line with veiled faces . For the most part they refused to undress and insisted on being examined by the application of a magnifying glass to their palms : this , it transpired , had been the method used by a certain Yugoslavian , who had circulated about the Gulf , in the guise of a physician , some seven years before . There was no way of proving that more patients had died from this system than from others , but the women agreed , after many whispered consultations , that Dr. Barzel might examine them by his own technique , which he explained was from Heidelberg , though only through their clothes . The young doctor had no choice but to accept , although in at least one case , that of a woman covered with pustulating boils that had been unsuccessfully treated with camel dung , the husband of the patient , the local sheikh ,  | allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room with her body inside and her face sticking out of the room through a bead screen , so that Dr. Barzel would never know who she was . Her companions from the harem sat outside by her head , wiping her brow with handkerchiefs , while by her body sat its lawful owner the sheikh , the local kudi , and an old woman who chewed kif and spat the juices on the floor . " You simply ca n't be a bad doctor in the Gulf , " Dr. Barzel wrote to a physician friend . " Without any medical care eighty percent of the sick die here , so that even if you 're a terrible doctor and kill seventy percent of your patients , you 're still ten percent ahead . " Most remarkable of all Dr. Barzel 's cases in the Gulf was one that involved the sixteen-year-old wife of a local emir , pregnant with twins , who had been told by the midwife that she could not give birth because the infants were upside down inside her . At the time DoctorBarzel was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent a hand of armed horsemen who stopped the train , removed Dr. Barzel from it , sat him on a great steed with a canopy rigged to the saddle to shield him from the sun , and escorted him at spear point to the patient . She was frightened but curious , even gay , and not scared enough to permit Dr. Barzel to treat her as he would have liked . The emir too put his foot down : his wife , he said , was too young for such things . In the end Dr. Barzel had to perform the operation for which he afterward became famous in Jerusalem : he reversed the breech babies through their mother 's dress . " I had no choice , " he explained , his willowy body shaking with laughter . " Also , I pressed and pressed until the fetuses had no choice either . " After five months in the Persian Gulf and Saudi Arabia , Dr. Barzel took note of the fact that his Organismus , however debilitated , was still alive , and decided that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Damascus and bought a horse , on which he proceeded to cross Transjordan , stopping to cure several people of what ailed them on the way , and to arrive in Jerusalem via Jericho on Yom Kippur eve . When after a leisurely ascent from the wasteland of Judea he spied the  | spires of Augusta Victoria and the Church of the Transfiguration on the Mount of Olives , he dismounted with emotion and continued slowly on foot , leading his horse by the reins . Near the village of Abu Dis he caught sight of the entire wet , gray , sullenly beclouded city straight ahead , the churches in the Kidron Valley glistening with a tinny sheen , the houses of Bethany on the hilltop like a flight of gulls , their fierce , cold whiteness frozen in black cloud . Directly before him stood the darkly dripping ramparts of the Old City . Then Jerusalem broke into detail , no longer an encompassable whole . The city for which he had suffered so many months in the wilderness now spat cold rain over his face and clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctor Barzel was forced to conclude that his Organismus had become unable to take the cold of a Jerusalem winter . His first week in the city was spent in bed with pneumonia . " Dear friends , " he wrote ruefully home , " I 've already learned two things here . The first is , always approach Jerusalem from the desert . The second is , whatever you think of this city , it will always surprise you in the end . " His first year in Jerusalem was a hard one . The orthodox Jews of the city were hostile to his free ways . They too , of course , did n't hesitate to call him when ill even on Sabbaths and holidays , but though they looked the other way when he entered a patient 's house , they more than once shouted insults at him , even hurled stones , when he left . His violin was repaired : the expert who fixed it was named Alfred von Kluck , a stranded Prussian whose two great passions in life were fiddle making and bulldogs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new neighborhood of Rehavia . An Arab gardener planted jasmine and rose bushes , orange bignonia , and inkblue delphinium , and Dr. Barzel wrote away for a cedar of Lebanon to put in his garden : a cedar , it seemed to him , was the right sort of thing to go with a new home one had built in Jerusalem . Precisely this reentry into the forms of civilization , however , from which five months in the Persian Gulf had unmoored him completely , made him fiercely nostalgic for home . His mother sent him all the furnishings of his old room in Frankfurt in a neatly packed lift , including his old black desk ,  | his Biedermeier table , his black , round-seated chairs with their antique yellow upholstery , his heavy Persian rug whose fine weave and soft colors he only now had learned to appreciate , and , most important of all , his Bluethner piano . Sometimes , on late afternoons , when the heat had died down , the air was full of the fragrance of flowers , and the next-door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other side of the fence , he was n't sure whether he was here or there . He played his violin for hours on end , solo , hitting the wrong notes , consumed by longing . It was always his opinion that the cedar failed to take root because he himself had n't struck any yet . One evening , while he was still struggling to learn Hebrew , he sat down and wrote a story in it , the gist of which was as follows : Once , when the Israelites were wandering in the desert , a certain man named Reuel was placed on trial before Moses . This Reuel was a poet , a musician , and a seducer of hearts . During the long desert nights around the campfire he sought to sway the people to return to Egypt , telling them of the wonders they had left there . Those old enough to remember grew homesick unto death . Everyone was sure that Moses would make short shrift of Reuel : sooner rather than later , undoubtedly , the earth would swallow him up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on and on in Moses ' tent . Reuel was asked by the leader to sing about Egypt , its great palaces and fertile river . " Why , you 're homesick , too , " he exclaimed . " Anyone with a little culture has to be . What do you have here sand and promises ? " To which Moses replied : " True enough , but I consciously prefer that which is in the process of creation to that which is finished and known . " Forthwith he summoned Eviatar , the captain of the guard , a young product of the desert whose men had just taken prisoner a caravan of Ishmaelites that had passed nearby . He bade him free the wayfarers with all their goods , and ordered them to escort Reuel back to Egypt under penalty of death should any harm befall him . The bare-footed Eviatar , to whom the fuss made by the old people over Reuel was incomprehensible to begin with , nodded and did as he was told . Moses personally accompanied the departing caravan to the limits of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to Reuel.  | " Frankly , I 'm afraid you 'll come to no good end in the opium ( le Ramses , but in the meantime , give my regards to the opera hut ' Memphis , whose tower I still see , golden in the sunrise , at leat one week in my dreams . " Dr. Barzel never published this story , which he filed away in drawer of his big black desk . His sense of Hebrew , he told him was not yet good enough to write in it . It was a language that had green lawns between its words . Besides which , he knew ntohing . t Sinai , his descriptions of which were almost certainly inaccurate , his mother he wrote : " I do n't deny that I sometimes feel homesick , but I 'm not bird from here . I 've always been in search of the absolute , and Jerusalem a very absolute place , though it could stand to be a bit cleaner . " His second year in Jerusalem was marked by two events . First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ princess from Bet I lake who was fifteen years younger than he ; secondly he discoverer I . t m partner , a certain Captain Tony Crowther . Now his meals decently prepared , his collars were freed from the hated starch t hat laundress had refused to leave out of his shirts , and his evening% spent with Captain Crowther , who accompanied him on the piano sonata after sonata , while his voice carried happily down the fragrance Rehavia street : " La , sol , la-fiat , ugh , kvatch ! " Hulda , fifteen years younger , who loves him very much , laughs in next room whenever he hits a wrong note . Her laugh is like sliver% sunlight . Nobody in Jerusalem called him Doctor Barzel . At first he w known , because of his red hair , as Doctor Ginger , which was shortened to Doctor Gingi , which eventually was corrupted toDoctor Bimbi . People forgot he had any other name . Everyone called him Bimbi , even Hulda , her twin brother , Amatsia , and their whole mad cap family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a stranger , would say , " My name is Dr. Barzel , alias Doctor Bimbi. "  | Amatsia , lazy cat-eyes and a Philistine profile with a nose that descends in a straight line from his forehead , comes every afternoon to the Barzels ' house in Rehavia to tell Hulda about his latest conquests . Here and there he even exaggerates perhaps for her listening enjoyment . Face flushed , eyes nervously flashing , she suddenly peals with laughter or claps her hands sharply with covert satisfaction . " Amatsia , no ! I swear , you did n't ! " Her long , thin hands almost pluck at his shoulders ; her face is feverish , flushed . " Amatsia , " she whispers , bending over him . " Tell the truth . Did the two of you really ? " " No . " " I do n't believe you . She 's always falling all over you . " " Let her fall . " " You 're so handsome . " She lightly bites his earlobe from behind . " By God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother . " " You might say I would n't throw out your shoes if I found them under my bed , either . " They talk , as though to rid their systems of an ancient desire . Next to her , his mirror image , but a woman , he feels his own blustering masculinity even more strongly , the difference , inescapable , between his twinness and hers . They had grown up together , curled around one another in the same amniotic fluid , their fingernails tiny , coeval , their two heads like half-empty sacks on the fragile stems of their necks , their mouths as though painted on their faces , flesh of each other 's flesh . And back further : a pair of bloated stomachs side by side , primitive beasts from the Pleistocene , an amoeba still unsplit . Once , when they were three years old , Amatsia took sick with something contagious . Hulda was moved out of their bedroom to keep her from catching it . Immediately both came down with an itchy eczema that did not go away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was infected . They lay happily together , babbling past midnight . The eczema was gone in two hours . No one tried to separate them again .  | " Hulda , " Doctor Barzel once says to her , glancing at her in the penetrating manner that she refers to as his educational look , " you should n't encourage Amatsia 's wild side so much . " " Do I ? " she regards him wonderingly . " But he does n't come to me for advice , he just tells me about it afterward . He 's lucky I 'm not a jealous sister . " " You 're a very jealous sister . It 's just that you feel safe as long as he has twenty girlfriends instead of one . " As though to soften the severity , but not the seriousness , of his tone , he lifts her triangular , sorceress 's chin with his freckled hand and goes on : " He 'll get married one day , you know , and even if your sister-in-law is a saint , you wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twinkle : " But he 's not married yet , Bimbi , is he ? And I 'm still his best friend , are n't I ? " " You 're married , though . " " I 'm allowed and he is n't . I 'm not permitted to sow my wild oats for the sake of my Organismus . All I could do was get legally married . Amatsia knows I had no choice . It would have been different if I were a man . It 's all in the Organismus , you see . " " At least now I know why you married me . " " To have redheaded children , Doctor Bimbi . " " How you 'll ever give birth to them with those narrow hips of yours is beyond me , " he says fondly . " You know what ? Let 's try and see . " He holds her , towering over her , her flared foal 's nose twitching finely , pressed to his chest until it almost hurts . A treasure house . Her lovely contralto laughter in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the brink . She is all flower , all brinks , all of which are imaginary : the brinks of a fairy-tale princess , which exist because she does . In the end it was Tony Crowther who brought Sara to Dr. Barzel 's hospital . After first convincing the doctor , he had to struggle to per-  | made Gracia , who did n't think that hospital work was class . Sara herself was fir from excited about it , but she agreed to give it a try . She arrived with Tony Crowther , who waited smiling in a corner of the room like the cat who has brought in a valuable find . " When you were a little girl , " asked Doctor Barzel , " did you or did you not climb trees ? " " I did . " " That 's good . That 's very good . The best women are those who competed with the boys when they were small girls . If you 're already a little lady when you 're ten , that is not so good afterward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . " " Are you scared of dead people and ones that do n't look so nice ? " She thought of Shabu covered with almond blossoms . " No . " She got the job . Tony Crowther asked his friend what he thought of her . " Eine Topsy , " he said , " but I think she 's got heart . " By the end of the month she had become indispensable to him . She came every morning , as fresh as though life were just starting : youth come into the fortress . The hospital had massive walls , enormous casement windowsills , high ceilings , rooms that opened on rooms that opened on n ) ( tins . Sara found a new world in each . Once they brought in a drugged young Arab who had overdosed . I ) r . Barzel was unhappy with the way the intern on duty was treating him . He put on an apron and took over himself . Sara assisted . They pumped the Arab 's stomach . He gagged , teared , fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young man who did not take responsibility for himself , " said Dr. Barzel while working . " A young man like this can no longer be easily set straight . He does n't have what it takes , morulisch . No important values . " " He just wanted a good time , " said Sara . " Is that forbidden ? " Dr. Barzel straightened up : " No , young lady , it 's not forbidden to want a good time . It 's just very , very vulgar . "  | Another time he lectured at an autopsy : " I admit that death is hard , but that is the price that the human race pays for its individuality . When life in this world was nothing but amoebae and primitive plankton , death did not exist . The Organismus just went on dividing and dividing , ad infinitum . Even if the original amoeba died , in other words , it did n't matter , because it still existed in all its other halves . Such an existence is in effect immortal . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Death has given us individual worth , fear , love , humor , the knowledge of good and evil , values . Without death nothing would be worthwhile . " They listened in silence . On their way out Dr. Nahum , a short , stocky intern with puppy-haired skin , standing next to her said : " Fine , that 's all very nice , but what was he teaching today , medicine or philosophy ? " " How do you know where the dividing line is ? " Sara asked . " I know where it is . And I 'm here to study medicine . " Many came to the hospital who were poor and homeless , beggars and emissaries who went all over the world collecting for Jewish causes and organizations . They were a sort of circulatory system of the nation , always coming back again to Jerusalem , which was the heart , and going forth reinvigorated once more to the farthest , outermost limbs : back and forth , back and forth , with their stories , foreign currency , and diseases . Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked hearing about faraway Jews he did n't even know existed . Most of these patients , however , did n't remember very much besides the prices of goods and flophouses .

She is toothless , bodiless , with legs like broken matchsticks enclosing a diamondlike space ; in her dreams she sees the snowy peaks of Georgia , embroidered sheepskin coats , fur hats , brides bedecked with apple blossoms ; the high mountain dialect she squeaks in is comprehensible to no one . Into her body goes a stream of blood and medicines , while  | curses herself yellow , the world black around her , her face a hard of dark , thin threads . No one comes to visit her .

Both had mustaches , though Lida was somewhat the softer and quieter of the two .

A customer who smiled too much could be a svoloch ; so , certainly , was the Kurdish vegetable man ; so , indeed , was anyone not an Auerbuch . The world was not to be trusted . Whatever had cast them in the first  | place on these shores , with their reefs of eggplant and banks of yoghurt , among so many svoloches ? They served coarse bread , yoghurt , olives , eggs , salad without pepper or oil , blintzes , and coffee from which all the coffeeness had been wrung .

Lidochka , that is , Lida , was in charge of crumbing up after meals and keeping the restaurant clean , though the young doctors and nurses who ate there did n't leave many crumbs in those days . They liked the place because it was sterile , neutral , like the food of old people who are afraid to taste anymore : it had nothing of the zing or crackle of life , nothing to remind them of the body , its long decay , and that other , cloying smell they had just escaped from for a while . One day Firochka came up to the table where Sara was sitting with Dr. Nahum , Dr. Tidhar , and several nurses and said in a low voice so that Lidochka could n't hear : " I 'd like to ask something of you .

She frowned evasively . " It just so happens that I know . Do I have your word ? " " Do you always make sure to organize everything even before it 's happened ? " Dr. Nahum persisted . " Why , if somebody did n't organize things , the world would be one holy mess .

Between quarrels the blintzes were burned sour , the cucumbers went unpeeled , the milk for the cofturned sour , and the dishes made their rounds without being shed anymore . Nahum , Sara , and their friends developed the habit washing them in the sink of the WC , but things clearly could n't go like this much longer . One morning they arrived hungry for a late breakfast from the hospital to discover that the co-op had been closed without any date for reopening . Dr. Tidhar was not well liked . He had a mustache like a pair of quotation marks and hair drenched in brilliantine , which he covered with a black net at night to keep from getting mussed . When he walked , he glided with long steps as though dancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging over the wash basin to attend to his shaving nicks , or squeeze the pimples on his chin , before saying good morning to his patients or even glancing at their charts . The patients learned to wait . His best friend in the hospital was Husni , the youngest son of Subhi Ivey and his wife Faiza , a prominent Arab couple who had close ties with most of the better-known Jewish families in town . Husni was a male nurse , which meant that he changed dressings , gave injections , and looked soulfully at every female patient from the age of six to sixty as though he lived for her alone . After work he assumed a second self : now he was the romantic crooner Steve Harold , whose great desire was to become a world-famous singer . He was by no means inhibited , and sometimes , on request from the staff or the patients on the ward , he put a white panama on his head , reached for a walking stick , and sang : Swaneeee , How I love you ,  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood like a star , mindful to bow his head despondently when the last bar was done , modestly letting a boyish curl tumble over his forehead as the applause rippled forth . Both Tidhar and Husni were bon vivants . More than one young lady , to her own surprise , had found herself bestowing her favors on Husni for no other reason than his talent for gratitude . " One kiss from you , " he would say in his Steve Harold voice , " brings heaven to earth for me . " Happiness . Bliss . The lost Eden . Eventually , it was discovered that Husni 's paradise was strictly graded , and that in a small black notebook he kept an alphabetical list of Jerusalem 's females with well-researched observations on each . A scandal ensued but it did n't last long . Husni simply changed his approach . " You , " he now said to the girl he was with , " are n't notebook material at all . With you it 's pure feeling . Here , feel how my heart is pounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several nurses , all local talent , had finished the hospital course and were awaiting their diplomas , Dr. Bimbi decided to hold a ceremony . Professor Marcus , the dean of the medical staff , was supposed to preside ; but as he was n't feeling well that day , Dr. Bimbi , who was about to be made a professor himself , did the honors instead . Sara and the other girls sat on a bench , knees primly touching , excited . " Girls , " he said , very concentrated , his eyes floating above them in space , " my dear girls . You are now officially part of the war that all of us are waging in this place . It is a war in which there are never any absolute victories . Death is still stronger than all of us . The most we can manage to do here is to delay a man 's death a few years . Nothing more . " There was a stir among them . All through their studies no one had talked to them like this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victories . " You will have to share the load with us knowing full well that all  | victories are at best partial , incomplete , without illusions . It wo n't always he easy for you . I expect there will be moments of weariness I despair . There have to be . And so I want to ask every one of you , right here , before you receive your diploma , to consider carefully ether you have the strength to spend all your working time with us c , perhaps your whole lives , winning victories that are always parand uncertain even when they are occasionally great . Nothing you here will last forever . If you 're looking for a taste of eternity , go c and raise children . Not here . And if any of you , or all of you , feel you are not cut out for such a life , you 'd best speak up now . " No one moved . Most of them did n't know what he was talking about . Dr. Barzel sighed and handed out the diplomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bimbi has no call letting out his German despair on us at a time like this , " one of them said . " I want to feel happy , and he has to ask me II kinds of questions that do n't even have any answers . " ) r . Nahum , who walks Sara home afterward , agrees . They turn down the alleyway , which is now a frocky , baskety , hung-up-to-dry gold in the soul-colored sunset . They pass a dusty old cypress tree , which looks in the first fading light like a dusky candle drowning in its own dripping wax . " What would you have said , Nahum ? " " I 'd have said : Congratulations on your graduation , girls . If any of you thought it 's been difficult until now , just wait till you see what 's ahead . And now get cracking , the bedpans in surgery have n't been emptied for two whole hours . ' " She laughs and takes a dancelike step , her rolled-up diploma tied by a ribbon to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she has what it takes to be woman . Or a mare : long hair , long legs , a long neck . " You see , Sara , " he continues , " Bimbi is an excellent doctorfor his generation . I look at both life and medicine differently . And Bimbi 's mistakes are as big as his soul . I 'm not at all sure that I need Schubert and all that in order to be a good doctor . "  | " Have you had a fight with him ? " " Naturally . This morning he called me a rationalist . He said that I had the ultimate vulgarity of all rationalists . " " Why are you men so competitive ? " " Why are you women so inquisitive ? " He kisses her good night . She is taller than he and is surprised by his intensity . A puppy dog , full of self-importance , hot-skinned and ambitious . Now that Sara was a nurse , she and Grandfather Amarillo became friends . " You 're the only one in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing something for others , por los otros . " He liked to talk with her , to go for long twilight walks . Sometimes Ofra came too . Gracia made her sit at home all day long with nothing to do . The three of them are strolling from the railroad station to AbuTor . " Once we lived in the Old City , " he tells them . " Everybody did , inside the walls . I ca n't tell you how crowded it was . My father was one of the first to move out , to Mishkenot . Suddenly there was room . My mother could n't get used to all that space , she hardly ever left the house . I remember how Father used to come on his donkey from Abu Tor on Sabbath eves bringing guestsJews , Arabs , Turks . He 'd stand just where we are now and shout across the valley : A good Sabbath , Behora , a good Sabbath ! ' She 'd hear him on the opposite hill and get ready . " " Did she comb her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it pretty ? " " Maybe she combed it . I do n't remember it so well . It was always covered . She wore a nice kerchief on it . She used to grind her own coffee by hand . We ground everything then by hand , with millstones , or pestles . It 's not like today when you buy it all ready-made . " " Look how Jerusalem 's grown , " Sara says softly . " I remember when there were hardly any houses here . " " The rabbis compare Jerusalem to a fig tree . Just as the fig has a short , stout trunk but spreads very wide , so Jerusalem first grows strong within walls and then spreads all over the hills . "  | " Him and his rabbis ! " snorts Ofra under her breath to Sara . " Nothing matters to him unless it 's written in some old book . " " Why do you care ? " " It annoys me . It 's time he turned off the holy tap . " " I f I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amarillo , " I 'd be a farmer . What I like to read best to this day is the part about growing things in the book of Hemdat Yamim . " Ofra , fed up with caring for her good looks at home , goes to work for he electric company . Now she wears suits and heavy makeup and sits typing all day in an office in Omariyya . Her small , dovelike knees tot Ise the compassion of the men . One night she comes to Sara 's room . " Tell me , Sara , are you still a virgin ? " " No , " Sara says . ( ) fra puffs nervously on a cigarette . " So is it true what mother says , that once you start with a man you ca n't stop ? " Like Victoria that day with the seamstress , Sara does n't know what to say . " Why worry about it ? " " There 's this treasurer at the office . He just walked me home . I tell him that I do n't want him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , but what really is a person to do ? " Sara , tired after a day at the hospital , is in no mood to preach . " 1 ) o what seems right to you . " ( ) fra is offended . She feels Sara is being condescending . " Well , " she says spitefully , " you have to because you 're too big . I do n't . I 'll get married a virgin , in a white gown . " She stalks out , taking tier scent of tobacco and her perfume that Sara can not stand . With all her affectations , her purple cartwheel hats that she wears on Sabbaths , her aloof airs , she is getting to be more and more like Gracia . She too , in a sense , is a portrait of captive refinement , but she is more captive than refined . Her tiny body perfumed and irritable , she rubs against the bars of her cage . For the first time since Zaki Amarillo 's disappearance , something is beginning to stir in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amarillo spends long hours . Captain Tony Crowther keeps coming back . He is enchanted with Gracia , the uncertified widow , and no less with Elder Amarillo , whom he calls Dr. Amarillo , since a doctor of divinity was the closest thing to an elder he could think of . " Dr. Amarillo , " he asks one evening as they are sitting around the table , " how do you explain the fact that the Jews fought so many wars even after they received the Bible on Mount Sinai with the commandment not to kill ? " " The Hebrew Bible , Tony , does n't say Thou shalt not kill . ' It says , Thou shalt not murder . ' " " Oh . I see . Our Bible is n't translated correctly . " Another time he asks : " Dr. Amarillo , what in your opinion is the mission of Jerusalem ? " " Mission ? " ponders Grandfather Amarillo . " Jerusalem is its own mission . Whatever God wills will happen to it . " After the Englishman leaves , he remarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think of it . What is Jerusalem lacking right now ? My own father used to say to God : If , God forbid , You should ever decide to remove Your presence from this city , please do n't let it worry You , because we 're staying put , come what may . ' " Cracking sunflower seeds between her teeth one Saturday night , Victoria says : " Did you hear the latest about Leon Cordoso ? When Solomon Cordoso comes to visit him the other day , he turns off all the lights : after all , he says , we 're brothers , why waste electricity ? So yesterday , Leon comes to see Solomon and finds him sitting there without pants . What 's the matter , Leon , he says , after all , we 're brothers , why wear them out ? " " Do n't be a badmouth , Victoria , " Grandfather Amarillo cautions , but he too joins in the laughter , wagging his beard and baring his perfectly yellowed teeth . " Tell us another one , Victoria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . I 'm all out of badness for today . "  | cs of light in the olive trees outside . A pure wind shakes the vc thistles . The hillside slivers into infinite detail . Sky without Something , Sara feels , is inexplicably starting to blossom , something impermanent and bruisable in which a kind of happiness is nonetheless to be . found . The city seems to be filling up more than growing out , way a child 's mouth fills with teeth : a hill on which there had been house , three , suddenly grows a whole street . Buildings rise on the ty lots of her childhood that had once been strewn with junk . n Nissim Mizrachi , that is , Miracolo Orientale , has changed his burial cart for a fine black automobile , which it took him a long while am how to drive .

Subhi Bey and his wife Faiza come and visit on Jewish holidays , bearing gifts . Subhi is a well-to-do merchant , the scion of a large banking may with whom the Amarillos have business connections . Faiza had spent a good part of her youth in Europe and Constantinople , where her father , a Lebanese intellectual , served in the Ottoman , diplomatic corps ; she was betrothed to little Subhi , who is a head shorter , while he was on a banking mission for his father in Turkey , and never saw his face until their wedding . They have three grown sons and a daughter . Faiza wears a black veil , as is the urban Moslem 's custom , but removes it in the houses of friends , and sometimes , near her home , even in the street : the fact of the matter is that she would gladly have thrown it away entirely . She has never traveled since her wedding , except once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was studying agronomy in Berlin . She is on close terms with Gracia and fond of both her daughters . Sometimes Hulda comes too , with Dr. Barzel , now Professor Barzel , who has fallen in love with the Amarillos ' large house : echt Jerusalem , he calls it . Grandfather Amarillo joins the guests on the ter-  | race in his black caftan , and instructs Professor Barzel ( the red one , he calls him , as red as the porridge that Jacob served Esau ) , on the olive tree : " Your olive , Professor , is the tree of light . Not your fig , or your carob , or your acacia : only the olive . Consider for yourself . The underside of its leaf is silver , of no other tree is this so . Each time the wind blows , the whole tree lights up . That 's its silver . And from its oil , lamps are made that give a fine , soft flame . That 's its gold . So there 's a tree of light and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll explain that to you too . " " Olives have always looked grayish-green to me , " Professor Barzel confesses . " If you 'll excuse me , Professor , that 's because you have European eyes . " " Faiza 's mother , God rest her , " Subhi Bey comments , " used to hang olive-oil lamps from the ceiling . She 'd fill little bowls with colored water , arrange them in a big glass dish , and put olive oil and wicks inside them . We 'd hang the whole dish and watch the colored lights from below . " There is always some fragrance , some special smell , at Grandfather Amarillo 's : frankincense or myrtle , a whole branch of it sticky with sap , and during the High Holy Days , branches of rihan , brown , green , and violet . On the fast of Yom Kippur he takes a bundle of them to the synagogue to use like smelling salts , so as not to pass out from the heat . People in the neighborhood think it is n't so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really is . Gracia sings . In a virginal , surprisingly strong voice , pleasant in its unwavering persistence . It rises , piercing the casements . Tony Crowther , coming to visit that Saturday morning , stands still in the street for a moment to listen . In Seville there is a castle Thousand wonders all around As she is n't done dressing yet , she sends the two girls out to stroll for  | a while with Tony in the field . It always takes her a long time to dress , mostly in purple , all shades of it . Her huge , nebulous hats look like the rings of Saturn . An unfathomable , enchanting , unapproachable widow . A galaxy of romantic suffering . Neither water nor perfume Can make his deep swoon disappear . Only these three magic words That she whispers in his ear . " What a lovely voice your mother has , " says Tony to the girls . They walk almost as far as Sha'arei Hesed . " It 's as bold as a flower of the dd . " Ofra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " asks Sara , playing dumb . Tony falls for it : " A white one . Lily of the valley . " Sara and Ofra frown contemplatively . " It does n't grow here . " " It does n't ? " Tony is taken aback . " No . Name a flower that does . " He thinks and thinks and can not think of one . " Name any plant at all , " they say to make it easier . " You 've been re so many years , Tony . Where are your eyes ? " " All I can think of is carrots , " Tony admits . " Let 's see you name five ants . " He is deluged with them : " In this field alone ? Anemone . Cyclamen . Groundsel . Veronica . arcissus . And now five more that begin with the same letter : Chrysanthemum . Clover . Campion . Chicory . Carob . " Tony throws up his hands : " I surrender ! I surrender ! " Btu Sara wants to teach him . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hecre , you can eat this . It 's a mallow . " Ofra plucks a chicory leaf " ' Taste this too .

I 'm a well-meaning ignoramus if you like , but there are other things here that I know something about . " " Like what ? " " Like the wars in the Bible , for example . " " That sounds interesting . Tell us about them . " Tony ignores their sarcasm and declaims : The Assyrian came down like a wolf on the fold , And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold . Sara thinks it over and says : " I doubt that the Assyrians wore purple and gold . More likely they wore ordinary linen or sackcloth . Who said that ? " " Byron . " " Well , he 's not exactly an expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit hurt , " you 're literal-minded to the point of pedantry . Where 's your imagination ? " They are close to the house again . They tell me the way that I 'm going Does n't have any way back , But if it costs me my life to keep on it , I 'll follow the same old track . Gracia sings on and on in her room . Soon she 'll come down , a purple , suffering queen . There was a mysterious old man in the hospital : no matter how carefully his diet was watched during the day to lower his blood sugar , the sugar count when taken the next morning would be high again . Finally Sara looked in the drawer of his night table and found a hidden storehouse of chocolate , cookies , whatever was on sale at the stand below . Every day he stole furtively downstairs , restocked his treasure , hid it away , and nibbled it up at night like a rodent . He was a selfcentered , cunning , half-senile old man who giggled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would do it again . He pretended to be sorry and was n't . " He just does n't want to be discharged , " Sara told the doctors . " He lives in an old-age home where nobody ever looks at him , while here he gets lots of attention . Why should he want to leave ? " A noisy argument broke out on the ward between Professor Kapulski from Odessa and Professor Barzel . Kapulski was for throwing the old man out at once . Barzel wanted to reason with him , to give him another chance . " Guess how it ended , " Nahum tells Sara . " Kapulski pulls himself up to his full height and says to Bimbi : I 'd like you to remember , Herr Kollege , that I 'm a professor here too , and your senior . ' So Bimbi pulls himself up too , nostril to nostril , except he 's a little taller , and says : And I 'd like you to remember , Herr Kollege , that I 'm from Heidel-berg !

He pulls the pins from her hair , which is done up so tightly , unsparingly , smelling its scent of daywarmed rose . He embraces her , short and hard , in the wild , shooty tangle of an olive tree . Sara traces his puppyish nose with her finger : a warm , shaggy , thick-coated little dog . His embraces , she thinks , are like himself : to the point and unimaginative . " You rationalist , " she says . She is feeling sad . " Can I take you out again tomorrow ? " " You 're too ambitious , Dr. Nahum . " They go out with each other two or three more times , but Sara knows well that she would find no new truth here . She rises , brushing the dirt from her uniform . " That 's enough , Nahum . " He is mad . In the hospital he does n't talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are part of a team racing to save the life of a boy who has fallen off a scaffold . When Nahum can  | finally change his blood-soaked clothes , he says , in lieu of an apology , in a boy-man 's voice : " When you feel you can go to a movie with me , let me know . " " As far as I 'm concerned , it can be right now . " They sit and watch an Egyptian film , cracking sunflower seeds , good friends . " I feel so good I ca n't stand it , " says Sara to Hulda . " I feel so good I ca n't stand it , " says Hulda to Bimbi . There is much good feeling all around . The days lead simply into the nights . Waking is easy . Grandfather Amarillo rises early to walk with the dawn breeze . A cypress touches Venus , still shining in the sunrise . The feel of the hill is familiar . He picks up a God-fearing stone and breathes in the dry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ olive trees . He waits for the full weight of the light on the hill , his feet exploring the ground , the ground exploring his feet . Elder Amarillo 's mornings are a daily re-encounter of his long black robe , his hands , and the light .  | " LEAD ON , TONY ! " Among ancient fig trees , in the streaming , flickery light , three horses canter along the Roman road near Motsa . Captain Tony Crowther rides in the lead , followed by his friend Major Jim Saywell , expert equestrian , expert ornithologist , while the rear is languidly brought up by Saleh , the Arab groom and father of six . Saleh knows all about horses . Times are good . He gives vent to his sense of wellbeing by singing long , flat desert songs that rise now and then like a wave of sand to descend the other side of the dune , low , wind-swept melodies with a tremolo at the end like the tips of a tamarisk branch in the forgotten distance . The sky is too blue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint it , Tony thinks , it would be with a blazing black iris at the center . The stone is incandescent in the white light , as is the terra rossa beneath it : barbed , sunbaked , hard-visaged stone . Shapes of it like marbles , like loaves , spurt from under the hoofs of the horses , large , gravelly pebbles like eyeless skulls . The terraced hillside is covered with flowering yellow broom , sheaves and sheaves of it among the rocks . Swifts spear the figs and dart off , spear the figs and dart off , with vivacious , provocative flight . Three horsemen on a hill . What 59  | more could happen to them now in this sudden gust of wind , this copi ous year , this ascetic , unremitting mountain land ? " Swifts , " says Jim Saywell . " Bound for Europe .

Other days she is a man , fierce , dry , and ancient , smelling of thyme and wild goat , his head covered with a sack against the wind , bare feet viny-veined , brusquevoiced and ornery , sniffing the slippery scent of sin in abandoned alleys , the odor of prophecy in public squares . The city lives without mirrors , each of its dwellers the key to an ancient , ironlike place , lattice-faced , wall-chested , sandaled feet skipping lightly over crooked , anonymous cobblestones , through openings , endless doors . Always an unsolved remainder , footprints belonging to no one , im probable clues , a taste of permanent mystery . A veiny , living tension from street to street , house to house .

But now it is behind them , dove-colored , far away . " Jim , look ! " " A falcon , " Saleh the groom says indifferently , chewing on the end of a stalk . A smallish falcon has burst the circle of swifts , which it feigns not to menace . The swifts try keeping above it , spinning dizzily overhead in tight upward spirals , while the falcon seeks to outclimb them : a long ,  | ng , almost indolent dance , a weightless pursuit around a tall , invisible pole , until they are lost to sight . y lowers his gun , rubbing the cobalt flood from his eyes .

Anyway , that 's how he talks . " " The Right Honorable Reginald Welsley-More is a congenital 1 . " Agreed . But he 's also short , and short people have a way of attachthemselves to you and hanging on . If I were you , Tony " " Well , you 're not , damn it .

There is n't a one of them that ca n't be persuaded to have his palm crossed in the end . " " With thirty shekels of silver , before prices went up . " " Tony , what about lunching in Ramallah ? I 'm beginning to be famished . We 've been out seven hours without eating . " Tony turns to the groom and asks in Arabic : " Saleh , do you know of a good place to eat in Ramallah ?

" They urge on their horses , ascending from the valley toward Nebi Samwil among dusty , scattered pine trees , along a grayish , rocky , barely negotiable trail , until they rejoin the main road at Kalandia . Passing through the village , they are besieged by a host of runny-eyed tots in strip smocks who shout : " Good mo'ning , good mo'ning . " They ride swiftly by . " What a beautiful country this could be if it had no people in it , " Jim Saywell remarks . " Really , they are superfluous . Do n't you think that their biblical God might be planning to get rid of them all soon with one of his famous disasters ?

" They reined in the horses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veranda paned in blue glass . Saleh went to water the horses . It was pleasantly cool on the veranda . Large jars of purple pickled turnip rested in the muted light beside containers of sour se balls in golden green oil , pickled onions with parsley , violet ' plant , and slices of yellow lemon , each a sour , caged little sun . " I f you tried painting these colors , they 'd look trite , " said Jim Saywell . " But here they seem natural . I say , Tony , I believe there are tic friends of yours here . " The veranda was deserted , but in the dim interior , beyond an open ad screen , several men with mustaches , wearing European suits and flias on their heads , sat huddled around a small table . Among them any made out Taleb and Husni , Subhi Bey 's eldest and youngest ns . He waved across the room to them .

" " Not anymore we do n't , " whispered one of Taleb 's friends who had been eavesdropping on the conversation . Taleb rejoined his friends . Bent almost double beneath his load of trays , the owner of the restaurant decked the table with a score of different salads , platters of golden roast pigeon , plates of saffroned , mouth-watering rice . The two Englishmen relaxed and ate . " Saleh brought them here , " said Taleb to his friends . " Right here . ) f all the restaurants in Ramallah , he had to pick this one . " They nodded .

The family does n't like his being a singer . But I do n't see what 's wrong with them eating like you and me . " " They 're not eating . " " Maybe they 're done . Or maybe they just came for coffee . " " One ca n't be too careful . " " For God 's sake , Jimmie , let me eat . " They resumed their meal in silence . Jim Saywell said : " What annoys me most about our Reggie is the names he calls people . He calls all the Jews ' Beards ' and the Arabs Towels . ' Why towels , come to think of it ?

" He and two others rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the two British officers , who bowed slightly back .  | A quarter of an hour later , while the two Englishmen washed down their meal with coffee and a satisfied grunt , Saleh lay half-sprawled and half-seated on the toilet outside , a knife thrust through the crude planks of the outhouse deep into his lungs , his pants pulled down , his life departing . Through an aperture in the door , in a sky gone mad with cobalt , he saw , or thought he saw , the falcon and the swifts once again . But perhaps it was only his eyes , spinning with black dots , Ix fire the final darkness settled in . The two officers assumed that the missing Saleh had gone off on his horse to visit his family in town . Full of sun , sky , and food , they gal-1 lied wordlessly off to Jerusalem without even thinking to wait . Professor Barzel passed the cedar of Lebanon in his garden every day . It gave him no joy . It was the third such tree he had unsuccessfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its earthbound upper branches rising and sagging fitfully by turn , it seemed afflicted with every illness in the plant books . " Will it live , Hassan ? " Professor Barzel asked his gardener . " Never . It 's a waste of time and work . " Professor Barzel ordered botany texts from Europe in the hope of finding some clue to treating it . None of them mentioned cedars , but he sought to apply what they said about water , fertilizer , and the cul-t u re of conifers in general to his own thoroughbred plant . It was hard to say in the end which the cedar responded to more , the treatments prescribed for northern larches and firs or the sheer attention that it got , but day by day it looked better . It perked up so that even Hassan grudgingly conceded : " It 's taking . " " It 's taking , " Professor Barzel triumphantly asserted . He decided to throw a party for the cedar . He sat down and cornposed a heartfelt letter of invitation to his friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties any of them could remember . There are days in Jerusalem , Professor Barzel liked to say , t hat are especially Schubert daysand though not all his guests were quite sure what he meant , this was certainly such a day . Gracia came  | with Sara and Ofra , all three in long , light-colored gowns , carrying new parasols in their hands . Subhi Bey came with Faiza , who wore the traditional black dress , now brightened by a colorful scarf and a smile that took ten years off her age . Husni came later , straight from the hospital , hungry and thirsty , with a red rose for Mrs. Barzel . The unruly-haired pianist Walter Rudi was there too , dark as a wild raven , perched predatorily among the women ; Tony Crowther was there in his summer uniform ; so was Hulda 's twin brother , Amatsia , lounging with cosmic laziness ; so was Madame Arthemis Savvidopoulos , who dreamed of marrying off her daughters to rich Greek tycoons but could n't find one in Palestine ; so were the violin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the door , and the newly retired Professor Marcus . " My dear friends , " Professor Barzel declaimed by the cedar , toast in hand , " I am most fond of you all , each by himself and all together . I consider this banquet of love to be one of the last manifestations of civilization in a world which is being unfortunately taken over by Barbarismus . I do n't know whether the next generation will still know what it is to feel the friendship and intimacy that we all feel tonight . Here 's to all of us , and to the cedar tree that refused to give in and struck roots and lived ! " Everyone applauded . Hulda poured Sara a drink and said under her breath : " Concerning friendship and intimacy , there 's more going on than meets Bimbi 's eye . " " What are you getting at ? " " That Husni 's been poking around . He dropped by the other day . I threw him out politely . What do you think of him ? I rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Subhi and Faiza wanted to ask their close friends ' advice about their oldest daughter , Suhaila , but had trouble finding an opening . Finally Faiza confided : " You know , my friends , it 's no secret that our daughter Suhaila is already twenty-eight years old . She 's a fine , educated girl , a teacher in  | the OId City , and we hear she 'll soon be made a principal , but we still vent found her a proper match . " " We 've turned down many offers , " said Subhi Bey . " We 've turned down many offers . And then just two or three wceks ago a couple we know from Ramallah comes to see us with a cssage from a certain young man that he 's interested in Suhaila. heat did they know about him ? That he 's a pharmacist , never married , an educated fellow who 's just returned from his studies in France and wants to open a pharmacy . We asked Suhaila . Invite him over , ' she says , and we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the young man . We spent the whole evening together , the three of them , my brothers , and my eldest sons Taleb and Kamal . We must have sat there for three or four hours without him even opening his mouth , not even when I tried talking about Paris , which I have n't seen for ages . " " The boy has heavy blood , " said Subhi Bey . " The day before yesterday our friends came back to inquire if the young man might ask for Suhaila 's hand . But I do n't know a thing about him , ' Suhaila says . I have n't even heard his voice yet . I want to %cc him in private before I decide . ' Our friends told the young man : and would you believe it , he took offense ! If they want to examine me , ' he says , I had enough examinations in France ' and he calls the whole thing off . It 's hard to be an educated girl today . We brought Suhaila up to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now we do n't know what to do . We ca n't start sending her off to dances , after all . It simply is n't done . " " They 've brought her up neither here nor there , " Amatsia whispered to Tony . " Suhaila 's simply spoiled , " declared Subhi Bey gloomily , his neck flushed . " All the girls are nowadays . This one she does n't like , that one has to be examined , that one is n't educated enough . The result of it all is that she 's nearly thirty and we 're still waiting to celebrate . " " Never you mind , " said Madame Savvidopoulos , pulling out a handkerchief and daintily wiping bits of strawberry from her pursed lips . " She 's sure to find her true love in the end . Some wait more , some less . Did you ever hear of a flower , Subhi Bey , that grew and grew without blossoming ? Give her another year or two , you 'll see . "  | Amatsia snickered , but Subhi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Truly , you 've sweetened our hearts with your words today . " Professor Barzel was telling old Marcus : " You know , not long ago we received a government order to inspect all the brothels in town . Sa'ada 's was first on the list . It was no simple matter deciding whom to send . In the end we picked the youngest and shyest of the residents , that puppy , Dr. Nahum . Let him learn some professional poise , we thought , it wo n't do him any harm . So off he goes to Sa'ada 's and we made sure that he went by himself . How was it , Nahum ? ' we ask when he gets back . Fine , ' he says . They 're all in good health and used to being examined . They even called my speculum zubb al-hukuma , the government 's prick . ' We saw it was no use kidding him , so we dropped it . Only what do you think happens yesterday ? Nahum shows up with a nonchalant look on his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of paper . Believe it or not , he received a love letter from one of the whores . You must admit , my friend , that 's a rare compliment for a young man his age . You can imagine how his reputation at the hospital has soared . When they call for the man now , they mean Nahum . " Old Marcus laughed and laughed . " Music ! Music ! " implored the guests . Professor Barzel and Tony took their places . " An afternoon like this requires Schubert . Rosamunde would be in order , but we wo n't tire you with long works . Just one allegro from a sonata . A-minor , Tony . " They played , Tony fluently , with few mistakes , Professor Barzel with many , breaking on and off into song , waving his bow with true amateur passion . Gracia and Faiza , who did n't care for such music , sat at a distance . " Just look at Doctor Bimbi , ya Mother-of-Taleb , " said Gracia . " He 's done Jerusalem a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing with him tonight . "  | Husni arrived as the allegro was nearing its end . He was besieged immediately . " Sing for us , Husni ! Sing ! " " One minute , I have n't eaten or drunk anything yet . Such distinguished company deserves me at full strength . " Hulda served him with a plate and a glass , brushing against him more than she had to , while Bimbi looked on uncomplainingly at this further note of harmony in his banquet of love . Madame Arthemis Savvidopoulos approached him on her swollen ankles , busily waving a paper fan . Lately she had been reading Saint Augustine . " Professor , what do you think about feelings of guilt ? When do they begin to appear ? " There was a stir among the guests . Subhi Bey , a believer , belittled all guilt feelings that were n't directed toward God . One must distinguish , he said , between shame , a purely social emotion that was best avoided to save face , and guilt , which was God 's . Amatsia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gracia , wine-mellowed , confided : " When my husband disappeared , we all felt guilty without knowing why . It was as though we were to blame . And yet we were n't , we really were not . " " The fact that I 'm here at all makes me feel guilty , " said Tony Crowther , caught up in the confessional mood . " Here I am , a pagan from the north , whom fate has put in charge of you ancient monotheists . We Europeans are the parvenus of civilization , my friends . You were law-abiding people when we were still living in the tree-tops . " Subhi Bey nodded . " We respect your feelings , Captain . Unfortunately , not everyone is like you . Just the other day my brother , whom you all know , Hajj Kamal ad-Din , a man of great culture and the world 's leading expert on Sufi poetry , was asked by a young upstart in the military dental clinic whether he brushed his teeth every day . " Hulda made a face . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all animals in some biblical zoo . We 're human , you know . " " And you , Walter ? " " Why deny it ? After an unsuccessful recital , I 'm chock-full of guilt  | feelings . The piano was guilty , the auditorium was guilty , the audience was guilty , the critics were guiltythere 's guilt wherever I look . " Laughter . Alfred von Kluck , whose turn it was to say something , was silent . He kept his thoughts to himself , inside his shaven Prussian head , and drank a great deal . " And you , my dear friend Doctor Bimbi , " asked Madame Savvidopoulos , " have you nothing to tell us ? Are your angelic hands free of guilt ? " " No , I feel no guilt . Sometimes , though , I feel something much worse and much simpler . " " What is that ? " " Sin . " " Theology , " whispered Amatsia . " Bimbi 's getting old . Men get religion with age . " " Women are just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tell you how little all these ceremonies mean to me now that I 'm older . If I get hungry on the Ramadan fast I actually grab a bite before sunset but do n't breathe a word of it to Subhi . " " And the problem is , " Professor Barzel continued his tortuous line of thought , " the problem is , my friends , that I do n't believe in repentance one bit . " " Husni , " Amatsia said coldly , " if my sister 's done feeding you , I think it 's time that you sang . " " Soon , " Hulda interceded , as the figure of a new guest appeared at the gate , " let him rest a minute first . " The newcomer was a tall and somewhat bashful-looking man . " Elias Amarillo ! " she cried out . " I 'm so glad you came . " She ran to him and led him straight back , like a retriever proudly bringing its catch , waiting to have its nose stroked in praise , to where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden . Sara made a fine picture just then : a large , dark-haired woman in a flowing white dress , shaded by a red-striped parasol that veiled and enveloped her in its light rose penumbra ; her red-tinted wineglass , frosty with ice cubes , pressed to her cheek the better to feel its cold breath against her skin . Curious . More tuned to the world than to herself . The essence of woman in summer , thought Elias Amarillo.  | " Sara , I 've brought you another Amarillo . See if you 're related . I 'm sure you must be . His name is Elias . He comes from Tiberias and he 's a big lawyer who 's returned from abroad just in time to get our hospital out of trouble . Soon he 's going to discover a paragraph in international law for us that will prove the British High Commissioner illegal . " " Call me Eli , " he grinned . His mouth was long , generous , dark ; when it smiled it grew even longer , narrowing to a slit like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at each end by two sharp , ironic angles . He had the lanky good looks of a cypress tree , of a tall , spare rabbinical student . Modest and excellent . " And by the way , Mrs. Barzel , I 'm sorry to tell you that the High Commissioner is perfectly legal . " " You 're from the Tiberias Amarillos ? " asked Sara , alert , raising her head . " A son of Tio Sasson 's ? " " My father is Tio Sasson 's first cousin . Ezra Amarillo , the drug-gist . " " That makes us second cousins once removed , Eli . I 'm Elder Moses Amarillo 's granddaughter . " " Then you 're distant enough to get married , " ruled Hulda , still sniffing , making them slightly ill at ease . " You 're Zaki 's daughter ? " he asked . There was no need to say more . Word of the scandal had reached Tiberias long ago . She nodded . " My mother and sister Ofra are over there in the corner . Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said her second cousin once removed , matter-of-factly . How could anyone 's mouth be so long ? Perhaps it had been charcoaled in . She liked his subtle impudence . " Well , I hope you manage to get to the roots of your family tree . I 'm off to cheer up Madame Savvidopoulos , she 's looking rather glum . Von Kluck is n't talking to her . He has n't earned his refreshments . He just sits there staring silently at Ofra in German . " Husni ran his hand through his hair and struck the pose of a romantic tenor for his audience . He cleared his throat , bounced a trial note off the ceiling and caught it , half-covering his ear with his hand ,  | and announced that he would sing " The Indian Love Call . " His voice floated smoothly down the Rehavia street as though a hidden , honeyed tap had been opened in his throat . " Sweet , " said Madame Savvidopoulos , looking dreamily upward . " Sweet . " Tony tittered . " My husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look at him . Have n't I told you ? Subhi , God bless him , ca n't stand Husni 's singing . He says that his family has always produced scholars and farmers , farmers and scholars , but never singers or entertainers . When we get home he 'll chew Husni out for agreeing to sing . He 's been very hard on him lately . Too hard . " " It was the host 's request , " said Gracia . " Husni could n't have refused . " " I 'll make that my line of defense , " Faiza said . " And you yourself do n't mind , Umm-Taleb ? " " They 're big boys , " said Faiza in her mellifluous voice . " Let them fly the coop if they want . " Sara suddenly felt that she could not cope with it all anymore : not with Husni 's syrupy song , which for all its commonness had everyone enthralled ; nor with the overpowering , unbelievable scent of jasmine , honeysuckle , and snapdragon in bloom ; nor with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sinking red sunset , breaking against the fragile wineglasses , against the folds of the women 's dresses , through a too-wildly flowering shrub ; nor with the soft , pure , innocent air ; not even with the little cedar tree that overcame and grew . It was all too much for her . The guests drew near each other as darkness was saturating the stillness , with a contentment that would never return . Even Amatsia seemed at peace . Sara rose and went farther into the garden . She took a deep breath . The little wine she had drunk was taking effect . Elias followed her . " What is it that you feel , Sara ? " She tried making a sweeping gesture with her hand , but it fell limply to her side . " That this is all for the last time . " " Do you really think so ? "  | " I think that completely new times are ahead . That we 're celebrat-g the end of something tonight . This city is full of tensions , Eli -- they 're even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignore them xlay because it 's Bimbi 's party , and all of us love him , we 've swept cm under the rug . But how long can you go on sweeping tensions under a rug ? " Elias nodded . " This city gets us all in the end , " he said quietly . " I 've been away for so long I forgot . " From within the house came the notes of a duet on the Bluethner piano : Walter and Tony were thunderously improvising on the love theme from Tristan and Isolde . Professor Barzel , a little high , approached Elias and Sara in the darkness . " Ah , it 's you ? You 're in love ? Love each other , I say . It 's all there is in this world . " He vanished . Elias bent over Sara . " May I ? " " Not tonight . " " You just said yourself that it 's all for the last time . " Her voice dropped . " It is , Eli . I 'm as sure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This lit-up garden , all these lovely people ... " She trailed off . " I 'm a man of reason , Sara , " he said uncertainly , if not unhappily , 14 he took her sudden openness as a tribute to his attentiveness . " I believe in prophecy , but with a grain of salt . Are you an artist ? " " No . I 'm just a nurse . A sister of mercyand not even an experienced one . " " We have a little sister , ' " Eli declaimed from The Song of Songs . He smiled his brown , wounded smile , looking quizzically down to check the rest of the verse : we have a little sister , and she hath no breasts . She laughed . " Come , Eli , let 's go back to the party . " They walked slowly hack . The magic spell had begun to dissipate . Faiza donned her shawl at Subhi 's command ; their driver was waiting outside . Madame Savvidopoulos had mislaid her purse and was ran-  | sacking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the piano and banged out a noisy rendition of Liszt that no one enjoyed . Hulda walked them to the gate . " Do you know what used to happen on evenings like this when I was a girl in Bet Hakerem ? The poet Bialik , who came for rest cures , used to go for long walks with the novelist Agnon , and we children would turn out the lights in our rooms so that we could eavesdrop on every word . " " What did they talk about ? " " I really do n't know . But they were terribly formal . You said the other day , Mr. Bialik . " I noticed in your latest work , Mr. Agnon . ' " " I always wanted to talk to Bialik , " said Amatsia , " but I never knew what to say . Finally , when I was in eighth grade , I got up the courage to go over to him . Excuse me , Mr. Bialik , ' I said , could you tell me what time it is ? ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " We 're talking about two famous authors , " Professor Barzel explained to the other guests . " Let 's go , Faiza , " said Subhi Bey . " This is not a topic we under-stand . " He smiled as he spoke , but a wall had already gone up . As though to leave no room for doubt , Faiza put on her veil . They stepped into their huge automobile and drove off . Tony , who was taking Gracia and her daughters home in his army car , seemed suddenly drunk , slow-witted , and thoroughly the Englishman . Professor Marcus was driven home by Professor Barzel , though he lived only half a block away . In the car Gracia complained that she 'd drunk too much wine and listened to too much European music . She was sure to get a migraine from it all . Tipsily nostalgic , Tony clung silently to the wheel . " It was a fabulous party , " said Ofra , looking off into the darkness . " Absolutely fabulous . " " Have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sara several days later .  | " No . We 've just had coffee together once or twice . There 's been someone else . " " Who ? " " You wo n't be happy to hear this . Husni . " " Sara , no ! " Hulda was so beside herself that she hopped up and down on one foot . " Steve Harold ? What on earth do you see in him ? " " He 's the most arrogant thing imaginable in bed , " Sara grinned . " There 's nothing to it . It 's all very technical . By the number . " " Then why are you doing it ? " " Do you really want to know , Hulda ? I have n't the vaguest idea . " When Taleb had returned from Germany , he told his father that he was bringing new methods of farming that he wanted to try on the family 's lands . Subhi , who had his doubts about both Taleb and the methods , gave his son a small vineyard near Kolonia to experiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taleb when he came back , as though he were in search of the biggest , most sultanic identity he could find and wrap around himself so as never to be anonymous again . His two years in Germany had been spent totally incommunicado . Each day after classes he shut himself dreamily up in his room , never venturing even as far as the local red-light district . The whole world , it seemed to him , was smarter than he and more important . He grew desperately homesick . The European winter depressed him no end . He loathed German food , the beef , the beer , the cakes with whipped cream . Early in the morning he rode off to the vineyard . The first thing he told his father 's workmen was to clear the land of all its stones , because his German professors had taught him that the soil should be perfectly clean . Next he instructed them to plow the furrows deeply , instead of simply scratching away a bit at the surface as they had done until now . The workmen looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep with their dark , brambly hands and thin mules that kept straying off course , but they did as they were told . Taleb rode out to the vineyard each morning , issued orders whether they were needed or not , and pored over his German textbooks to find something new to do every day . When harvest time  | came his grapes were few , small , and juiceless ; their stems came apart in one 's hands . All they were good for was raisins . It was then that one of his father 's old hands came up to him and said : " Ya Taleb effendi , you told us to take out the stones and we took them out ; you told us to plow deep and we plowed deep . But you might as well know that the stones trap the dew at night and keep the soil moist throughout the dry summer . And you might as well know that plowing deeply turns the subsoil up in the sun , so that the earth dries out right away . " Though Subhi was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with fine irony above his cigar smoke , Taleb never got over the humiliation . When he finally emerged from his room again , he was raging with a fully ripened hatred for all things foreign , with their superior , condescending airs , their finely concealed loss of face , and their ultimate disgrace for whoever adopted them . He even tried destroying his diploma , which Faiza snatched from him at the last moment and hid in her French secretaire that resembled a pregnant woman on beagle legs . Taleb gave up farming after this . His brother Kamal , who was two years younger than he , took over the family 's lands , while he himself moved into his father 's office on Saladin Street in Jerusalem to learn the real estate trade . It was only now that he began to realize just how much land the rich Arab landlords were selling to the Jews . He began having nightmarish visions of the whole country being parceled away . Even wasteland should n't be sold to them , he insisted to Subhi , who replied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He talked to Kamal , who simply laughed ; he talked to Husni , who said that something impressive , spectacular should be done . Yet when Taleb started to organize the meetings in Ramallah , Husni stayed away nine times out of ten . There was always the same excuse of the hospital . Yes , Taleb whispered venomously , the Jews need you to empty out their chamberpots . But Husni did n't react . His connections with certain people at and after work were far more important to him than Taleb 's young toughs , a band of inelegant adolescents , as he disdainfully thought of them . It simply was n't his style . How could you compare it to the British Empire , whose royal crooner he was in his daydreams , starring  | sensationally in London and Nairobi , Sydney and Bombay ? If only Taleb would leave him alone . Sara hurries to her rendezvous with Husni , which has been arranged for that day on the narrow , oilcloth-upholstered couch in the room of the head nurse , away on vacation ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staircase , shaking out her hair , her insides contracting sweetly , as sharply as a jackknife , even before she opens the door . Just let him not talk , she prays pessimistically , just let him not talk . She is so deathly tired of all bed-patterers . If only he 'd just hold her tight and shut up . But she knows that he wo n't , that she 'll have to listen to him , halvah and rosewater in English , Hebrew , and Arabic . Always the same words in the same tone of voice . You could switch partners in the middle and he 'd never notice . Sara laughs suddenly . The truth is , she marvels , that she does n't want to love at all . She feels only one urge : to live fast , to move fast , because no one knows what tomorrow will bring . Elder Amarillo had once said that as the world neared its end , according to Spanish Kabbala , time would start to accelerate , to behave in strange ways . A day might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week . Time would go out of its mind . Maybe it is happening now . Professor Barzel also senses that something is in the wind . He unexpectedly cancels his vacation , much to Hulda 's dismay . Their trip to Frankfurt is off . She 'll have to wait to meet her mother-in-law another time . One morning the vegetable man from Bet Suhur failed to appear in the neighborhood . That afternoon two Arabs from Malha hurriedly evacuated the boy from their village who sold newspapers on the corner . As Dr. Tidhar was sitting in his automobile in Wadi Joz , it was whispered to him that he 'd better not drive out of town . People looked up , sniffing the air in silence . The first fatalities were Lidochka Auerbuch , her Kurdish husband , and their one-year-old daughter . They were riding in a cart south of  | Jerusalem , on the road from Nebi Daniel to Halhul , when local peasants attacked them with clubs and axes . The cart was stripped bare . Fresh casualties followed . Travelers , Jews out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outskirts of town . Husni stopped coming to work at the hospital , whose lights now burned bright in each room through the night . " I 'm very sorry , " he told Professor Barzel . " I 'm a Moslem . " " You 're an idiot , " Doctor Bimbi shouted after him . The hospital staff all agreed that he was simply scared of the Jews . The Arab and Jewish neighborhoods pulled apart in a senseless , unavoidable separation . Armed militia patrolled the streets . When the Jews asked Sir Reginald Welsley-More for the means to defend themselves , the local police being ineffectual , he agreed to send an arms crate to each neighborhoodwith the proviso , however , that it be unsealed and opened only by an authorized British staff sergeant . Anyone else touching it would be punished severely . " That 's assuming , " said Miracolo Orientale sadly , " that the sergeant ever arrives . We knew the Turks were like that , but the English ? To think how we idolized them when they first came ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ militia in the three official languages of the country : " Thees Engleesh rrrifle . Your father , he die . Your mother , she die . Only Engleesh rrrifle , it never die . " The tension kept building . Arab mobs armed with clubs rampaged through one Jewish quarter after another . When the Moslem fast of Ramadan came around , an Arab policeman went about among the Jews with a loudspeaker and announced : " This evening will be two cannon shots . Please do you not be afraid . They are only for Arab Ramadan . " Women from Jewish settlements all over the country came to the hospital for a first-aid course . Sara met with them every day and taught  | them to give injections and emergency care . They were an anxious , serious , studious group : each knew that upon her return to her village , surrounded by a hostile Arab countryside , she could well be the most important person there . Sara thought she knew one of them , a middleaged woman with glasses . " Is n't your name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the answer . " Where do you know me from ? " She was really barely recognizable . She had grown rounder , motherly , unlike before . " I think I must have met you years ago , " Sara said evasively . Hanna 's expression reminded her somewhat of Tanhum : the same sense of injustice , of a blind , hot , disconsolate grief . Hanna waited until the end of the course to approach her . " Sara , several days ago I heard your last name , Amarillo . Well , it 's good to see what a fine , productive person you 've grown up to be . I want you to know that I appreciate very much all that you 've done for us here , and especially the fact that you 've treated me just like the others . If it would n't be psychologically hard for you , I 'd like to invite you to our kibbutz . Do you still remember Tanhum ? Do you remember the time he would n't let anyone feed him but you ? " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was as though Hanna had stood before the smooth marble of her memory and scratched away to pick out a few fossils , marring the whole facade . She did n't tell Gracia . Professor Barzel was knifed in the lungs . He had gone to pay a call on an Arab woman having a difficult childbirth in Sheikh Jarrah . He saw the baby and mother through safe and sound and was on his way home , near the Bisharas ' house , when he was set upon by a band of young men . There were about ten of them , careening wildly down the street , and they stabbed him almost casually as they passed . One of the Bisharas picked him up and brought him to the hospital . His condition was n't good . Old women , Jews and Arabs , gathered from all over the city to keen day and night in the hospital yard : " Doctor Bimbi , Doctor Bimbi , God punish us and not you , may you live to a hundred-and-twenty ! God think no evil of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . They drifted back again each time . Faiza came to the hospital in Subhi Bey 's car , nervous and heavily veiled . She went straight to Professor Barzel 's room . " My dear friend . We 're all praying for your health . " " Thank you , " he answered weakly . " And where is my friend Subhi ? " " Subhi refuses to come to the Jewish neighborhoods now , Doctor . He says the Mufti has declared a holy war . What can I do about it ? He sends you his warmest greetings and regrets that he ca n't come himself . But let 's talk about you , Doctor Bimbi , you know that the whole city is praying for your health ? " He lifted a hand with great difficulty . " These are hard times , Madame Faiza . Perhaps you should return home now and not stay here much longer . Subhi will be worried . It was very gracious of you to come . Please tell my friend Subhi Bey that I understand him perfectly , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry gesture of contempt . She pressed her forehead to Professor Barzel 's limp hand , put on her heavy veil again , and made a beeline for the car . The driver was angry . " You were inside a long time , ya sitt . In another minute the Jews would have been all over me . " " You 're all a bunch of idiots , " said Faiza . Dr. Tidhar packed and fled to Rumania . " This is n't for me , " he declared . " Yesterday morning , " said Victoria , " I 'm on my way to Barclays Bank when I suddenly see a gang of Arabs picking on this poor psgada of a yeshiva boy . They are grabbing his earlocks , pulling the hairs out of what beard he has , and making him spin round like a top and clap hands . As little as there is of him , there 's going to be even less in a minute . I look again and ca n't believe who I see : Husni , Mister Steve Harold the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , may the  | earth swallow him up with all his friends ! Well , you know me , I 'm big and fat and it 's hard for fear to get into me . Hey , Husni , ' I shout , so you 're a big man now , are you ? You have a big mustache , have you ? ' " " What did he do ? " " Cleared out in a hurry , that little fart , hijo de puta , except that Faiza 's no puta . He and his gang were good and ashamed . Each damned one of them is worse than ten Hamans . I was so furious that I forgot to cash my check at the bank . Now it 's not safe to go back . " Ofra made a scene with her mother . " Maybe you 'll finally stop having Captain Crowther over to our house now . You know the English are against us . You know he 's a spy . It 's time you showed him the door . " Gracia stood up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure ! Do you understand that ? Pure ! And he 's a pure man . Purer than your own filthy mouth ! " To which Victoria 's comment was : " You bet it 's pure . She 's half a woman and he 's a quarter of a man . It does n't even come to one whole urge . " Tony Crowther , now swamped with work , did his best to make sure that no more armed Arabs entered the city . Jim Saywell personally confiscated a few clubs on the Jericho Road . Major Saywell was for letting the Jews defend themselves , but Sir Reginald put his foot down : the British alone would keep order . The mystery of Saleh 's disappearance was never solved . When watermelon time came aroundin the midsummer month of Av , the time of figs and droughtand piles of ripe fruit lined the Hebron Road on the way down from Jaffa Gate so that the small , dusty Arab buses could hardly get by , whole families of Jews were slaughtered in Hebron and Motsa because they believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmed . Miracolo Orientale spent a whole week carting the dead off to burial . Back and  | forth he went , from street to mourning street . Each block had its griefs . Lying incapacitated and unable to help in the overflowing hospital , Professor Barzel lamented to each new visitor in his room : " We 're so weak , my friend , we 're so terribly weak ! "  | LATE AUGUST . U G The city is shaky . Squills shoot straight up beneath straight cypresses , gathering close as though they were offspring . Miracolo Orientale no longer works overtime , but casualties from the riots still fill the hospital . Sara is terribly busy . " Dead tired , like everyone , " Elias Amarillo said to Sara , who had asked him how he was . She had arrived late for their date in a cafe on Ben-Yehuda Street , unrefreshed , after an exhaustingly long shift in the hospital . But she could n't even think about it now ; her memory had caved in on itself . She downed her coffee in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few days ago , she told him , when she 'd felt the need to freshen up on leaving the hospital and had stood rouging her lips before a mirror , an old nurse had shouted at her for being shamelessly concerned with her looks at a time like this . Elias 's questions about her work were dismissed with a despairing wave of the hand . " It 's had . We simply had no idea how weak we were , Eli . " Even the olive trees seemed nervously disheveled to her , stricken with vertigo , malevolent whirlpools on the evil hills . Each hill was up to no good . Each stone hut among trees lay in ambush.  | " Eli , why do n't you join one of the self-defense organizations ? " " I ca n't . I 'm an employee of the British Government , and I owe it my allegiance . The day I join up I 'll resign from the Attorney General 's office . " She sighed . " That 's rather extreme integrity . " " That 's integrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sad-mouthed , his voice quiet when he spoke . The strength of a reed that could bend without breaking . " Look here , Sara , it 's not as though I have n't thought of it . But the truth is that something in me recoils from all this bravado . I hate the fanaticism of it , the blind passion , this business of an eye for an eye . It 's all devil worship . The politics of nationalism mean nothing to me . My way of doing things may be less romantic , but I think it sheds much more light . " " And what would you say that light is ? " " Let 's say , reason . Order . We must n't lose our heads , Sara . Nothing would be easier than to start another hundred years ' war in this country . I know that what I 'm saying does n't mean much to you now , because you 're still keyed up from all that you 've seen , but in a day or two it will make more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foolish ? " " Foolish ? Of course not . Look , I hate what 's happened to this city too . If I 'm a nurse , after all , it 's because I hate sickness , not because I love it . And I 'm more conscious of that than ever right now . I hate the Fridays with their talk of holy war in the mosques , this fever that everyone 's come down with . You ca n't even walk safely anymore from one neighborhood to another . And all the ambulances . It 's a disgrace , Eli , so much mutilated human flesh is a disgrace , a waste of people . " " That 's just what I mean . " A pale fire burned in his face . " Someone has to step outside of the charmed circle . " He rested his hand on hers . " Sara , this may not be the best time for it , but then again , there may never be any better one . And I think that now of all times one has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To start a home with all that that means . "  | " I rather agree , " she said cautiously . " But it 's all still a little remote for me . A little theoretical . " " Fine , I know that you ca n't be expected to make any crucial decisions right now . But keep the possibility in mind the next time we meet . " " Anyhow , you 've put it very nicely . " One hot afternoon , when the dusty branches of the fig tree seemed to hunker limply on the rooftop , a young man from the Haganah appeared at Sa'ada 's . Sa'ada was reclining at the time on a plush couch in the anteroom , which was the coolest part of the house , groaning and fanning herself with a paper fan . " Not now , " she said when she saw the young man . " The girls are all asleep . Come back tonight . " " I did n't come for a girl , " he said in an English that did n't sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a talk with you . " " What kind of a talk ? " she bristled , then began to pull papers from her dress . " Look . Everybody 's been checked . Everybody 's in good health . I swear to God , this place has nothing to hide . I run a clean house . " " I 'm not from the health department . I 'm from the Haganah . " " A'uz billah ! " she whispered in alarm , glancing around her . " Where 's your head , man ? This is no place to talk . The High Commissioner has ears up the fluepipes . " She pulled him outside into an untidily swept courtyard of sorts . Under the fig tree was a wooden bench . " Talk here , if you have to , not inside . " He explained what he wanted . Since her girls were likely to hear about such things as impending curfews and arms searches from the British soldiers who were their customers , the Haganah wished to pay them for the information . Naturally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass through Sa'ada 's hands . She looked at him sharply . " Who do I tell when I know something ? " " You 'll tell someone in the neighborhood . We 'll think of somebody . Maybe Cordoso. "  | " No , " she reflected . " I 'll tell the grocer . Him I see every day . Since when do I have Jewish friends around here ? " He accepted her terms . The grocer was amenable . People dropped in on him at odd hours , so that not even a stranger was likely to arouse suspicion . Shrewd businessman that he was , though , he quickly realized that the more people in the neighborhood knew that a curfew was coming , the better it was , since everyone ran to stock up on groceries in time . And so he took to informing the neighbors of what was happening with Sephardic synagogue tunes . If he heard from Sa'ada that a curfew was due , he would sing in the words of the Psalmist : Blessed are the home-dwellers , They shall praise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search was in the offing , he chanted the verse about baby Moses : And when she could no longer hi-i-de him , she took for him a basket of bulrush-es , and laid it in the reeds by the shores of the Ni-i-let Once , toward the end of a month , when all were hard-pressed for cash , the grocery store owner sang his curfew song all morning . Everyone hurried to buy food on creditand nothing happened . They all turned on him . " Why blame me ? " he countered . " Sa'ada passed me the word . Go ask her yourselves if you do n't believe me . " He knew that no one in the neighborhood was going to demean himself by talking to Sa'ada . " It somehow seems a little premature for you , Sara , do n't you think ? " Hulda asked . " I 'm not a little girl anymore , " Sara reminded her . " I 'm twenty-five years old . " " And you 're sure you wo n't mind forsaking all others ? You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hulda . And I do n't think that anything will be much different in the future . It 's all rather senseless to me , and I think it 's  | perhaps time there was a little sense in Sara Amarillo 's life . I know what you 're thinking : Sara , is this what you 've gone out into the big world for , just to bring home another Amarillo ? But that 's all that 's in view right now , Hulda , and I do n't mean to argue with it . Maybe I just want to be promoted a grade . " " Look , Sara , I 'm a different type from you . If I can say to hell with everyone else now , it 's not because Bimbi is God 's gift to the world , or because I suddenly went blind on my wedding night , but because whenever I get sinful thoughtsand you know that I have themI start feeling terribly sorry for him . But you 're not like that . You are n't all heart . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one part intuition , one part curiosity , and two parts mischief . But practically speaking , I feel I 'm doing the right thing . I feel that I have to , you can even say should . " " Well , congratulations ! " " Not so fast . I have n't decided yet , and the ward is still full up . I hear that Bimbi is getting discharged by the weekend . " " Yes , I 'm bringing him home from the hospital on Friday . I 'm already cooking and baking . He 's changed very much since the knifing . He just is n't his old self anymore . " " I 've noticed that . Maybe he 'll get over it as he gets back his strength . " " Maybe he will . " When Hulda came for Dr. Barzel that Friday and bent to tie his shoelaces , he began to cry . " It 's wrong to be so weak , Hulda . " " Come on home , you old Bimbi , you . " I le did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time reading , marking passages in the margins with a pencil . Perhaps that , thought Amatsia , watching him as he read , is the difference between our two generations : one makes notes when it reads and one does n't . Sara and Elias came to visit evenings . To everyone 's surprise it turned out that Elias had once played the violin too . " Wait , it 's a long story . It happened back in Tiberias . I was about  | seven years old , and we had a Lebanese barber who played the violin . I used to hear him practicing in the next room whenever I went for a haircut . It made me so jealous that I decided to learn to play too . The Lebanese said fine , he would teach me , but I had to have an instrument first . Of course , not only did n't I have the money for one , but where in Tiberias could I have bought one even if I did ? And so I swapped with him : I brought him an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gave me a violin . A big one , he told me . And it really was , almost as big as a cello . My shoulder became sunken from holding it . And it was a little broken too . One of the strings was torn , the bridge kept falling off , someone had burned a hole in the frame . " " He gypped you ? " " Not exactly , because my grandfather 's carbine was missing the trigger and its barrel was bent out of shape . It was a fair swap . He began giving me lessons . After I 'd kept it up for a year or two , my parents decided it was serious . Just then a Jew from Italy , who was a real violin teacher , not just a playing barber , happened to arrive in Tiberias . I was transferred to him , at which point he discovered that the barber had been teaching me the other way round : to hold the instrument with my right hand and draw the bow with my left . My fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never seen anyone play the violin the other way round in his life , but as shocked as he was , I still was n't good enough for him if I did n't play like Paganini by my second lesson . I saw it was no use , so I chucked it . " Bimbi laughed , perhaps for the first time since his accident . The Barzels stroll slowly through the twilight . Slowly , because Bimbi still has pains and a cough in his chest , and Hulda is pregnant . The child is large ; Hulda smiles whenever it kicks her moonlike body , now taut as a drum . She calls it Goliath . They are out for their evening walk , like good Jerusalemites . It is almost autumn and the nights are getting cold . The young trees of Rehavia are growing up . New buildings are going up all around . " Every true native of Jerusalem , " says Professor Barzel , " is always  | hungry for the absolute . Even if he reaches it , he goes on pining for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The problem is , " says Hulda sadly , " that everyone has his own absolute . Look at the sky , Bimbi , how the blue behind those scaffolds is so much deeper than the blue in front of them . " He stops to rest for a minute : " They 're building too much . It 's changing the whole character of the city . Jerusalem should n't be so crowded , or so square-angled . And those water tanks are an error . " " When I was a girl in Bet Hakerem , there was once an old stonemason working down the street . One day Amatsia asked to be shown how to lay stones . There 's nothing to it , the old man said . Just lay the stone however it wants to be laid . " A spasm of pain comes and goes as he smiles . " Hulda , what will become of us ? You 'll have an old wreck for a husband . " " I 'll have a Bimbi for a husband and a Goliath for a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Professor Barzel conducts a study of the names of Jerusalem 's neighborhoods , about which he writes to a friend in Germany : The question of nomenclature is most interesting . Some neighborhoods here have names like prayers for succor and strength that never seem to come . As the present is always bad , the Jews have learned to live in a future that is always sure to be better . Romema , Uplifted . ' Ruhama , The Pitied One . ' Ezrat Yisra'el , The Aid of Israel . ' Ge'ula , Redemption . ' Talpiot , Great Heights . ' Yemin Moshe , The Right Hand of Moses ' perhaps this last refers to Sir Moses Montefiore who built it , and perhaps to Moses the Prophet , who held both hands aloft while the Israelites prevailed . Some live in Mekor Hayyim , Life 's Source , ' while others dream of Sha'arei Hesed , Mercy 's Gates ' ; still others who never planted a seed in their lives named their quarter Me'ah She'arim , The Hundredfold Crop . ' And there are more modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brothers ' Estate , ' Nahalat Shiv'a , The Place of the Seven , ' Yegia  | Kappayim , The Laborer 's Lot , ' Kerem Avraham , Abraham 's Vineyard , ' Bayit ve-Gan , House-and-Garden . ' The Arabs , on the other hand , are more concerned with illustrious figures from their past . They have a quarter named after Sheikh Jarrah , a healer in Saladin 's camp ; they have an Omariyyah after Omar the Great , and Talbiyyah after Taleb . Ahmed Abu-Tor , a warrior of Saladin 's who used to ride on an ox , gave his name to the neighborhood of Abu-Tor , The Master of the Ox . ' The name Abu-Dis derives from a forgotten Greek monk , Betabudission . The houses by the Saint-Simon Monastery were once called in Greek kata monis , by the monastery , ' and the name Katamon has stuck to this day . A section of the city that was covered with sharp pebbles , sarar in Arabic , became known as Musrara , Pebbletown . And imagine , among the filth and caved-in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street name of Gottfried de Bouillion ! Thus we live , my friend , caught between a forgotten Crusader past and a yearned-for biblical future , with nothing to hold onto but the present , this damnably difficult here and now . When the Arab vendor from Bet Suhur returned with his break-ofdawn cry of yallah , burdegan , yallah , tomat , there was no more disputing that the wave of disturbances was over for good . And when Goliath was born , he turned out to be a pretty , redheaded girl . They named her Nili . Amatsia called her Copper . " I 'm late , " says Sara to Elias from the door of his rented room at the drop of Rabbi Akiva Street . The room has its own entrance , which is reached by descending a staircase flanked by tall dry hollyhocks . Wild marjoram grows in the cracks of the walls . The metal railing is askew . Elias stands below with his hands in his pockets , a long smile on his lips . There is a smell of scorched thistles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last of the summer , as though to quicken the coming of the winter rains by sending a cloudy reminder to the cloud-  | less sky . A strangely nostalgic , moving smell . An ending and a begin ning . " It 's all right . I waited . " A black cat that has been squatting like a sentry on the ( loot mat rises with obvious displeasure and looks balefully at Sara . " You have a cat . " " Oh yes , I belong to him . Did he curse you out just now ? " " I think so . " " Then curse him back . Never give in to cats . " Sara stands facing it , glaring full-force with a make-believe primi tive fury . The cat stares unblinkingly back . Sara bares her teeth like a lioness : " Grrrrrr ! " The cat slinks away , pretending to have noticed something among the hollyhocks , and disappears with a face-saving , supremely indifferent wave of its tail . " Bravo , " says Elias . " Not everyone wins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not every woman wins , says Sara silently to herself . She is suddenly curious to know what lies behind his fine , spare , impeccably Sephardic good looks . The room itself is wonderful , with a deep barred window full of pigeons , narrow and high-ceilinged like a cell in a cloister . The afternoon light breaks through the window at an angle formed by a massive stone wall that cuts diagonally across the view . Sparrows are nesting at the top of the shutter . A tall bed stands under the broad windowsill , covered by a geranium-red quilt , which seems to draw all the light in the room to itself . Shelves crammed with books stand in niches cut into the thick walls . A single rickety chair is piled high with books too , and there are more books on the table . Spiders on the ceiling . Spots of mildew on the walls . " Are the books on the chair for any reason ? " " Of course . To make us sit on the bed . " Sara lays the books on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does one get a cup of coffee around here ? " " Since you 'll be making me my coffee for the next seventy years , I 'll be a gentleman this one time . "  | He prepares it expertly . The way it 's made in Tiberias , he explains . " Frankly , " says Sara as she sips it , " the coffee 's better in Safed . " " Sara . You 've come to say yes . Otherwise you would n't be bantering with me like this . " " Do n't be so sure . " He looks at her and grins . " But I am . " She is amazed by the swiftness of her response . Several days later she discovers that Elias has thirty or more pairs of underpants and not a single undershirt . " Why so many ? " she wonders out loud . " Because they 're good for all kinds of things . For wiping the floor . Or for after shaving . Or for cleaning the soot from the kerosene stove . " She is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quilt , and Elias himself , whose time spent with her always seems to be a fleeting vacation from the complicated world of indictments and legal briefs . Sometimes she curls up naked on the bed , milk on geranium , while he works in a circle of light . He has the power not to look at her for long periods of time . It is clear that she will never be able to share the world that most matters to him , nor does he bother explaining it to her . She too does n't try to explain herself very much . We 'll live parallel to each other , she thinks to herself in a sudden flash of insight . Why should n't it be possible ? There is much humor between them . Much of what the Bible calls " sporting . Gracia decides that it is time to put the fear of God into Sara . " If you 're going to come home at one in the morning on a night when you are n't on duty , you need n't bother to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know of anything that people do at one in the morning that ca n't be done just as well at one in the afternoon . " " You should wash your mouth out with soap . Foo ! You 're just like your father . " To listen to Gracia , sin sleeps in its den all day long until half-past  | ten in the evening , when it sallies forth lantern-eyed like a lion for its nocturnal fling . The truth of the matter was that she never really consciously decided , but simply let herself float on a current whose direction was clear . There was no need to make up her mind . The first person she told was Grandfather Amarillo , who was very moved and gave her his blessing . " You , " he stressed , " deserve the very best . " For the first time since their childhood she realized that her grandfather had never really cared for Ofra . Victoria , on the other hand , raised Sara 's chin with her hand and asked searchingly : " Have you leveled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little . Victoria persisted . " Have you ? " " Yes , " she whispered . " You 've got yourself a fine young man , " said Victoria . " Ofra complains that he 's too thin . " " Do n't let it worry you , " declared Victoria . " A man and a woman should be like a knife and a spoon . " " Victoria , why did n't you ever get married ? " " It was n't marriage that scared me , it was a family . I was afraid that if I had children I could n't be Victoria anymore . This way I have my peace and my habits , I come when I want and I go when I want . If I want to climb up on the roof and go cock-a-doodle-doo , there 's no one to stop me . Besides which , look here , your grandmother drove us crazy with her cama matrimonial . It once occurred to me that those of us who were born before she moved out of your grandfather 's room that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . And then there were the three others who died when they were small . But your father Zaki and I had to grow up with all her crazy tricks : she delivered us flat on her back and never got up again . She never took us anywhere . She was always in bed . And so when Zaki went off and left you  | two little chicas , I said thank God I have no children and never will have , amen . That way there 's no one to mess up . " They sat saying nothing until Victoria roused herself again : " But you 'll be all right , Sarika . You 're not tied down to the family . Look at me , everyone thinks I 'm so brave because I do whatever I want , and yet the fact is that I 've never even had the guts to move out of this neighborhood . I 've lived ten feet from my parents all my life . You 'll do better in the end than any of us . " As Victoria had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reunion of todos los Amarillos . Elias 's parents came from Tiberias : Ezra Amarillo the pharmacist with a red fringed fez on his head , one of the last of its kind to be seen on a Jew in the country , his little wife , Allegra , and their sons Sasson and Zion . The latter did and did n't resemble Elias ; they laughed all the time and had none of his fine laconism . Druggist Amarillo was a punctilious man . He sported pince-nez and a well-groomed exact little mustache , and explained to Sara and Gracia : " There is much violence in the materials that I store in my pharmacy . What I keep on a single shelf is enough to wipe out not just one or two people , but a whole city . And yet I help people to live , not to die . " Gracia bowed her head in acknowledgment . Despite his laughable Galilean accent , with its r that spluttered in the throat , Druggist Amarillo impressed her as being truly the master of all the dreadful perils that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and limits who weighed things out wisely in hundredths of the gram and measured them to a hairprecisely what she herself was not . He seemed to her an admirable embodiment of masculine good sense . Druggist Amarillo conversed seriously with Sara , in a Galilean French mixed with Arabic , about Jean-Jacques Rousseau and natural education . Nowadays , he said , l'education was more scientfque . Sara was n't impressed . She had already heard from Elias that Ezra Amarillo had been the most draconian of fathers ; Rousseau had been one thing and sparing the rod another . Just like the French themselves , said Elias ; all reason on the outside , and a cold , egoistical core .  | Allegra , in a sky-blue brocade dress with golden trimming , cried under the wedding canopy . Gracia cried in violet . Victoria nearly cried . All felt anew the gnawing absence of Don /As Amarillo , whom all had managed to forget until now . Sara 's eyes sparkled behind her veil , which softened her pointed features , i bit I Irt lush , strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driven into it by Lisa , the Russian hairdresser , in accordance with the latest fashion taken from an old Odessa magazine . She and Elias , who looked fall , calm , and distinguished , were in the first-weeks ' bloom of mutuals covery and seemed contented and at ease as they swain etfortsslessly through a tearful , frenzied sea of family . Los Amarillos turned the wedding ceremony into a three-day convention . They cane from Safed , Hebron , and Tiberias , filled hotels and the houses of t her t t el l tives to overflowing , chased away flies with illuminated fans , nn , placed shawls and ornamental combs , and ate meat with pine nuts , stuffed burekas , and honeyed sesame cakes . And ate some more . Anil reminisced . In Spanish , Hebrew , Arabic , and French , all spoken in single breath . If all the Amarillos are here celebrating in Jerusalem , they told one another , it 's a sure sign that the times are looking up . Even Miracolo Orientale came , excitedly bearing as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand on the horns of a deer while she hid her private parts with the other . Sara and Elias rented a house at the narrow end of Melissanda Street , where it dipped toward the Old City wall . The house belonged to a rich Arab from Sur-Baher and stood by itself in a long-neglected garden . If you happened to glance to your right as you left the front gate , you suddenly saw the Mosque of Omar like a blue , dreamlike surprise , much bigger and nearer than you had somehow expected to find it . The tumult of the Damascus Gate was not far away , but Melissanda Street itself was always perfectly quiet . The house was whitewashed inside , and each morning the vaulted rooms became a blinding display of arched surfaces in varying degrees of white , light , and shadow . It was furnished with a few solidly comfortable pieces and many ferns in copper pots . The curtains were white , the bed was huge , and enormous chests-of-drawers filled the rooms . Gracia , who had never  | ceased considering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the absence of tapestries and gold picture frames , of pink lampshades and gilded Parisian chairs with thin , beagley legs . Your house has no refinement , Sara , she would say , absolutely no refinement . But the refined vulgarity of things was something that neither Sara nor Elias could stand . In a drawer of a chest Sara kept a packet of dried lavender picked from Victoria 's balcony that gave the room a rustic fragrance all day long . Elias uprooted the thorn bushes in the garden . Sara planted fruit trees . About a month after all the excitement , when the city in its sleep at night still clutched the mountain at any sharp noise , Grandmother Amarillo died of a stroke . Sara , who happened to be in the ancestral house at the time , unsuccessfully tried to revive her . The sumptuous white body that met her eyes when she stripped her grandmother 's frock off looked as though it had been preserved in milk . Sara stared with emotion at the blue veins of the breasts , the strong nipples , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had this woman spent her whole life hysterically in bed ? How could eight births have left no mark on her ? Sara shut her grandmother 's eyes more sorrowfully than she 'd have thought , pulled the blanket over her , and stood up . " Grandmother 's dead , " she told the agitated onlookers in the room . She might at least have said passed away , Gracia was afterward heard to remark . Grandfather Amarillo performed the ritual tearing of his clothes . He sat mourning in his office , both for his wife and for all the death and desolation that had been caused by the disturbances . His brother Yosef , " The-Messiah-Is-Coming , " sat in mourning with him . " The Peace of Heaven forgive me what I say , " said Tio Yosef , " but she certainly made your life miserable . I pray they do n't take it out on her in the world to come . " " She had a meanness , it 's true , " said Elder Amarillo . " But she held the house together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they bear us our children and keep us out of sin 's way , " agreed Tio Yosef.  | " What can you possibly know about it , Yosef ? You were never rven married . " " I keep my eyes and ears open . " " Well , then , I tell you , a woman in the house even if she 's no saint is better than no woman at all . Sometimes when she was sleeping , even alter she 'd left la cama matrimonial , I used to go into her room and see hrr lying there as quietly as a baby , with her white hair blowing a little , t his way and that , like a dandelion tuft in the wind . Blessed be God the true judge . " And he wept . When the seven days of mourning were over , Elder Amarillo said to his daughter-in-law : " Look , Gracia , it 's impossible for me to go on living with you here in this house . It is n't proper . You stay here and look after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will even come back to you one day . I do n't have to worry about finding a place , because when Avraham and Malka were married I gave them the house I owned in Ezrat Yisra'el . They can get rid of that communist who lives in the attic and let me have it for myself . " " Now , at the age of seventy , you 're going to move ? Are you sure you know what you 're doing ? " " If we do n't shed our old skins when we 're seventy , when will we ever get the chance ? " " I still think you should stay . Not one person in Jerusalem will think the worse of you for it . " " Why risk even one ? You stay , Gracia , you 'll have a big house for p satiempo . For entertainment . " " There 'll be no one left here but us women . " He shrugged : " What can I do ? No puedo nada . " Bukas quit and went to live in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pension . " Thank God we 're rid of her , " said Gracia , " she was filthy . " She hired a young girl in her place , who worked days without sleeping in.  | Elder Amarillo packed his things and moved out . There really was no one left in the house but women now . It was too clean , too polished and starched ; the furniture was always waxed and no one dared lay a finger on it ; the shutters were never opened because of the dust and no one moved a footstool from its place . The large main room turned into a kind of showplace in which no one lived and nothing was done . Gracia scrubbed and cleaned it of every trace of dirt , sweat , loud voices , human presence , life . She put pink knit shades on the lamps , sewed lace on the curtains , covered the chairs and couches with antimacassars , and scattered about potted plants of which it was difficult to say whether they were still furtively alive or discreetly dead like strawflowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mothballs in every corner , tied the bedclothes in the closet with violet ribbons , and closed off the rooms upstairs so that no one would enter them . Eventually she even had all the rugs covered with felt . " She 's embalming the house , " said Ofra to Sara . " You 're lucky you 've left . " " Why do n't you leave too ? " " That 's easy to say . " Elder Amarillo now lives with his many-sonned son Avraham and his daughter-in-law Malka . Half of their patio is covered with cans of flowers . Whenever they finish a tin of olives they fill it with earth and plant something new in it . " Los halutsim , " says Avraham to his father , " our pioneers , they do n't want to have anything more to do with the occupations Jews worked at in the exile , like cambio de money , brokers , and the like . They want to return to the soil , to teach their children all the things that their forefathers forgot . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They want to make a revolution in the world too . This communist who lived here upstairs , Mr. Monya , he also wanted to make a revolution . Only he did n't want any agriculture . " " Once when he was living here , " adds Malka , " I asked him to pick up three kilos of oranges for us on his way home . He turned up at the house with four oranges . What happened ? I asked . That 's what the Arab gave him for the money , he said . Excuse me , Mr. Monya , I said ,  | I understand that you want to make a revolution in the world , but how are you going to make a revolution in the world if you ca n't buy three kilos of oranges in the street without being cheated ? " " After he moved out of here , " relates Elder Amarillo , " I ran into him one day in the street . Hello , Mr. Monya , I said , where are you living these days ? In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have no intention , God forbid , of interfering with your affairs , but is n't it a little strange that you , Comrade Monya , should be living in a neighborhood named after an English baron ? Yes , rabbi , he mumbles , you 're really right , but it 's too late to move again now . He went away crestfallen . " The grandchildren laugh . Grandfather Amarillo passes his hand slowly over his face . " How it 's grown on us , this city . " The patient city gathers in people with the strangest ideas , philosophers , freaks , madmen , all of whom add to her a measure of themselves and disappear . Sometimes she seems to be built as much out of obsessions as of stone . The streets of the city teem with inventors , mad geniuses , incorrigible buttonholers , writers of petitions to the League of Nations . Here today , gone tomorrow . One day Sara is traveling on the bus to the hospital next to a chain-smoking , butch-haired woman of about sixty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says the woman to Sara . " But enjoy it , I tell myself , you only live once . " " How do you know ? " Sara asks . The woman looks at her with surprise . " Aha , I can see you 're an intelligent girl . In that case I 'll tell you a story . Listen carefully . I 've been shot with the same bullet three times in the last five years . Not three different bullets , the same one . And once I was already up there . I knocked on the gate , and suddenly I heard a voice call out from inside : Do n't open it . It was my late husband . Guess what ? He was living up there with a woman younger than myself and would n't let me in . So I came back down . That 's just one story . If you travel on this bus often , I 'll tell you a new one every day . "  | She leans over and whispers in Sara 's ear : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She is never seen again . A light-and-shade-struck city of light-and-shade-struck people . A narrow , arched passageway , gravid-shaped , wide enough for a small donkey ; the soft light behind it incandescing not on the man but on the red flaps of his clothes , his dark patch of a head barely brushing the moss growing out of the wall . A burro slowly climbs the narrow steps . Around the corner the aquamarine mosaic of the Dome of the Rock , a sudden treasure to look at , a prismatic jewel in a setting of stone . " I wonder , " says Professor Barzel , " whether the Hebrew verb l'hatsil , to save , might n't come from the noun tsel , shade ? In a hot country like this , where the sun is a medical problem , shade is truly salvation . " " It never occurred to me , " says Hulda , shading her infant 's face . " You have to have not been born here to think of such a thing . " A city you long for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most yourself and most miss yourself ; in which whatever you find , you will want again from afar . A dichotomous city in which everything is its own looking glass , forever mirroring , always the same sky reflecting domed rock cut from sky , always the same broad evening light casting back in reverse the red roofs of the houses . People draw near and recede as in mirrors . A few last gilded roofs . Still the spires of the minarets . Evening comes with an avalanche of longing , and you walk slowly through Zion Square as the first lights go on and buy a coal-hot order of stemmed hamleh m'lan from the scarfaced Sudanese vendor , eating it as though there will never be food in the world and no you , only this one perfect hunger that must be shared with a friend because everything is in it , this entire evening , and that is more than one person can bear . " When I was a girl , " Sara tells Elias and the Barzels while they are out walking one evening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the ground . It was n't a place you could get to by ordinary travel ; it was a secret , hidden land that could only be reached by going  | straight down , right into the ground beneath your feet . It had a Pharaoh and a great blockhouse for slaves . There were whole subterranean cities lit by lanterns , tunnels with hurricane lamps , warehouses full of grain , gold , and seeds . Sometimes I used to touch the sharp point of a rock sticking up in a field and tell myself that it was the tip of an underground Egyptian pyramid of which nobody knew but myself . And each spring came the exodus from Egypt , everything budding , sprouting , shooting up . Right here in this field near our house . " " And I used to think , " says Hulda , " that time was a river . If only you would n't swim in it , you would never grow old . " " Sara , is it true that Subhi Bey and his family came to visit you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just every Passover . And when they came it was always with a basket of presents , and dressed in their best . And we used to call on them for Id-el-Fitr , to bring holiday greetings . The things in those straw baskets ! Date syrup from palm groves they owned near Gaza . We were crazy about that syrup . What Faiza and we did n't cook for each other ! I remember how one Passover they came to visit Grandfather together with Taleb , their eldest son . He had just returned from studying in Germany , where he had apparently spent two years in total isolation . He must have been a pathetic sight there . He 's not terribly bright and it 's an effort to get him to talk , but there 's something serious about him . " Dr. Bimbi shakes his head . " He must have gone on living there by his own inner clock . And among all those Lutherans ! Good Lord , who sent him there ? " " Subhi , who else ? So Taleb very apologetically said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ibni , said my grandfather , ask , my son . Taleb wanted to know if it was true that the Jews baked their Passover matsas with blood , because that was what he had heard from Christians in Europe . Faiza jumped on him of course , and said he should be ashamed of such talk , while Subhi got all red and huffy ; I thought he was going to murder him then and there . But Grandfather did n't lose his temper . He told Bukas to bring some cheese , took a piece of matsa from the table , and said : " Ya Taleb , you and your father are familiar  | with our customs , and you know that no observant Jew would ever eat milk and meat products together . Look ! " And he put the cheese on the matsa and ate it . There was nothing showy about it , it was just a simple act , but we all had gooseflesh . For a second I thought I saw that Grandfather was wearing shrouds beneath his clothes . " " Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's much more pious than his father , by the way . As soon as he came back from Germany he married a very religious girl , the daughter of a kadi , who 's always veiled and never leaves the house . She 's already had three children and no one 's even caught a glimpse of her . Very orthodox . God only knows what Faiza thinks about it all . " Ofra is bored . She asks Gracia 's permission to invite a few young people to the house . Gracia says certainly not . During the year of mourning for Grandmother Amarillo not even an evening of Mr. Bialik 's poetry will be allowedand she does n't care what Mr. Bialik writes , though whatever Sara snidely says about her , she knows perfectly well that it is n't Spanish romanzas . In general , Sara is getting a little too smart for her own good lately . She , Gracia , has n't the slightest intention of taking the felt off the rugs and the slipcovers off the couch for a few young fools or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears yet . One evening Sara takes Ofra along to a staff party at the medical club . In the middle of a dance Ofra swings by her , beaming . " Do n't wait for me , I 've got someone to take me home . " " Who ? " " Dr. Nahum . " Though they try hard to leave inconspicuously , Nahum and Ofra do n't succeed . Nahum can not get Ofra 's coat sleeve on right . Ofra knocks over a hat-and-umbrella stand while searching for it with her arm and everything falls to the ground . The two of them slip away in the confusion . " A handsome couple , " says Elias , watching them as they leave . " How did they ever avoid meeting until now ? "  | Ofra keeps Nahum in check , jailing his passion with her polished red fingernails , always squirming loose at the last moment , driving both him and herself to exhaustion . Her little knees that rouse the compassion of men stick violently together . One day Nahum breaks the good news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm terribly happy for you , Nahum , really . " " I 'm happy too . I really had n't planned on getting married this year , but that 's how it is . Just looking at Ofra 's face makes me feel peaceful . Does anyone else in your family have blue eyes ? Where did she get them from ? " Sara almost physically has to stifle her doubts . " There 's one more thing , Sara . I do n't know how to put it . I 'd like to ask something of you : if Ofra still does n't know anything about what happened between us , I 'd appreciate it if she never found out . I do n't know whether you two talk about such things , but that 's a favor I 'd like to ask . " " She does n't know and never will , " Sara promises . She feels a hundred years old , a cosmic , all-knowing ancientness . The wedding was a modest one because the year 's mourning was still not up , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her white dress like a flag . " I wish I had a better feeling about them , " said Sara to Hulda . Gracia , who had never loved her daughters , now flounces flirtatiously around her sons-in-law without stop . She cooks them whatever she knows how to make without Bukaselderly , watery dishes that she has to urge them to eat . With Sara and Ofra she hardly exchanges a word anymore , as though they had outlived their usefulness the moment they acquired husbands . Everything about her seems to proclaim that women do n't matter . It is for Elias and Nahum that she now dresses up in earrings and shawls with a large Spanish comb in her hair . Once they even found her sitting on the veranda with a hat on . The two men barely conceal their aversion to her annoying flattery ; it may have been a product of her loneliness , but Gracia 's loneliness is itself somehow repellent . It makes one long for a breath of fresh air .  | " My daughters are brujas , witches , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their husbands come near me . They 've turned them against me . " It is n't true . The two men simply prefer to come as little as possible . Gracia keeps pawing them , keeps resting her more and more talonlike hands on their jackets and sleeves , as if to attach herself to them by force . Her red lipstick , which keeps getting all over her teeth , is too bright ; so is the red polish on her nails . It is excruciating to be with her , a Circe whose manacles are her puddings and dry cakes , whose prison bars are her incessant demands . Taleb saw dark visions of Jerusalem . The quarrel with his father started afresh every morning : Father , do n't sell any more land to the Jews ! Subhi Bey would lose his temper and slam the door . Now Taleb walks in the old walled city from the Muristan to Sheikh Lulu , along the unchanged Jebusite donkey trail that is now called ElWad Street . The marketplace teems with people whom he passes by unseeing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along its axis : the houses on its righthand side vanish , and a great naked mountain , the color of goat hide , rises in their stead . The earth is reclaiming its own . Why , they were built of it . The stone of the houses has been hewn from the mountain itself . From the bowels of the mountain it cometh , to the bowels of the mountain it shall return . The noise . The dice and backgammon games . The babble of tongues . Superfluous exhalations , all . The rock will rear up and take back what belongs to it , all this hewn stone chipped into rattling dice . Silence will return with a thunderous clap of the hills . He hungers for that silence with an actual physical hunger . He craves the moment when the tumult will cease and the wilderness swallow up the swarming , insectlike horde . No more modern life . Just a lone flock of goats in the twilight , a single barefoot shepherd boy . No more . No more . The earth belongs to God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to this race of loud peddlers.  | A city on the desert 's edge , its populace holding on with bare nails , high-strung , quarrelsome , haggling , wrangling , cupidinous . The weaver weaves and hawks his wares ; he sells his wares ; the buyer buys . None turn to look at the desert from which their forefathers had come , scaling the heights from below to conquer this place . And yet on certain warm nights , when a dry sirocco wind that has assembled its forces on the Plain of the Jordan , that has marshaled them again on the Mount of Qarantal , that has gathered reinforcements in the ascent of the Edomites , bursts through the streets of the city like the footfalls of an invisible invader , the desert overruns Jerusalem again . There is a groan , a stillness , a wound . And then silence once more . The broken tablets of the Law . Until morning . " Father , do n't sell any more land to the Jews , " Taleb weeps inwardly . " Do n't sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger than people , Taleb tells himself , stopping at a stand for a suck of nargileh smoke . Entire mornings now pass in such reveries . He is ashamed of his father : a compromising , sanctimonious trader of a man , forever fingering his prayer beads , every bead a sin . He should not let Faiza and Suhaila go about unveiled . He should not take Faiza visiting with him . He is destroying the purity of manly society , the noble fellowship of brothers to whom honor matters more than lucre or women . Father , weeps Taleb , ca n't you see what you 're doing ? Dream-driven , he has gone many times to Friday prayers in the great Square of Omar , has been pierced to the quick by the majestic power of the simple choir of men 's voices , of the great throng of believers , snow-white kaffias on their heads , diapasons from the Holy Qur'an in their mouths . Tremendous . Tremendous . But it has left him unpurified in the end . The markets of Bab-el-Silsileh , with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him each time beyond the square . The city has been the ruin of the Arabs , Taleb muses . It has made Jews out of them , Europeans , an effeminate world of women , thieves , avarice , and sorcery . Taleb knows what he will say to his friends the  | next time they meet in Ramallah : " Brothers , does the Arab still know how to keep the desert in his heart ? " Ofra burst into tears . " Sara , I 've never told you about it , I know , but believe me , I do n't want to go on living anymore . You do n't know how many times I 've gone to bed with the sleeping pills by my side and had to convince myself not to do it . It is n't a life that I 'm living , it just is n't a life . I 'm a prisoner like at mother 's , only now it 's even worse . There at least Bukas did all the work , I never had to worry about washing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day , he 's never home at night , if he 's not on duty at the hospital , it 's some patient waking him up from his sleep . And before I can say to him , Nahum , maybe this one time you wo n't go , he 's already dressed and out the door without even looking at me . Listen , Sara , I 'm not just anybody . I 'm a woman who needs a little attention , a little special consideration . If only he would look at me sometimes or bring me a flower ; if only I could cuddle up to him and know that we 'll have a couple of hours together without some old witch ringing the doorbell to tell him that someone is dying . Do you know what I do all day long ? I wait for Nahum . Six hours . Seven hours . I sit there and wait . " " Did n't you know when you married him that that 's what being a doctor 's wife is like ? " " I thought I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night I 'd go out with my husband to all kinds of nice places . Do you want to hear what happened last week ? Nahum had helped take care of some minor illness for the High Commissioner 's wife , who 'd been referred to him by Bimbi , and so last week we were invited to a garden party at their residence . Well , an invitation from the High Commissioner does n't turn up every day . I had a new dress made , I had my hair done , and then it 's time to sit and wait for Nahum . I waited , and I waited , and I waited . The Messiah could have come in the meantime . The invitation was for six , and at a quarter to eight Nahum walks in . Where on earth were you ? I ask . What could I do , he says , there were complications in the operating room . And he goes off to shower , and when he sees that there 's no supper on the table , he goes straight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he still wants to play around with me in bed ? The nerve of him ! Thanks a lot , Dr. Nahum , I told him , but tonight you 're sleeping in the other room . You might as well come and see the dress at least . What a waste . " Sara sighed . She spoke slowly . " I do n't know what it is about the women in our family . First Grandmother , then mother , and now you . Believe me , there are days when I know just how Grandmother felt . One just does n't want to get out of bed . " " You 're not like that , Sara . You 'll always get out of bed . " " Well , the fact is that I do . Listen here , Ofra : Nahum is n't your nurse , and he is n't your father . After spending all day in the operating room he deserves a bowl of hot soup from his wife when he comes home . " " You 're talking about another woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who gets the bowl of soup brought to her . By a waiter with gloves on . " One day several weeks later Sara ran into Hulda . " Sara , do you know that Ofra had an abortion ? " " Hulda , no ! " " Bimbi happened to be in the maternity hospital in the Old City and just saw her there . She had gone to a midwife who botched things up and sent her there for repairs . Bimbi tried talking to her , but she would n't answer . He says there 's a wall around her . " " Where 's Nahum ? " " I have no idea . " Ofra lay there very pale , her dry lips tight against her jaw , hinting at the skull bones beneath them . She lay as though she had made an ominous decision from which there was no being budged . " How do you feel , Ofra ? " " I 'm fine . With luck I 'll be out of here in a few days . " Her voice was strong yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | pipe . It occurred to Sara that she had changed drastically , even the sound of her . " You have no regrets ? " Sara wondered softly . She thought she might be pregnant herself but still was n't sure . " For getting rid of some frog in my belly ? Of course not . I am a young woman and I intend to live like one . No one 's going to make a mother and a grandmother out of me . " " Or of Hulda , or of me , or of thousands of other women ? " " Fine , so you 're all saints . " Sara took her hand : " Ofra , I want you to promise me one thing : that you wo n't make any decisions in your condition . You 're weak , you 've lost a lot of blood , you ca n't be expected to decide anything now . " Ofra shrugged . " It makes no difference . Today , a month from now it 's all the same . " " Do you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not afraid of it either . I 'm not such a weakling as you think . " " I can see for myself " " Sara , before you leave look under the blanket and see if they sewed me up properly . I do n't want to walk out of here like a barnyard door . " Sara felt taken aback , disgusted , without knowing why . " I 'm not the one to examine you . I do n't know enough about it . " " Fine , I 'll go ask that butcher of a doctor . " She must have felt pain again , for her face grew suddenly livid . Sara put a hand on her forehead . " Would you like a shot ? " " No , " she snapped between clenched teeth . " Do n't punish yourself . I 'll go get you a shot . " " Just go . " Ofra pulled the blanket over her head and groaned underneath it . Sara did n't move . Her hand was still on Ofra 's forehead , under the blanket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrated nerve of her own body , could sense each spasm , each smothered cry that fought to break loose , yet could do nothing to help . She could sense , too , the exact moment when the spasm passed , and Ofra went limp and began  | to breathe regularly again . But she still would n't talk or come out from under the blanket . It was as if , slowly , she were leaving the corridor of pain to enter a fresh , white , slightly misty room in which the assaulted body could finally sleep . Sara imperceptibly removed her hand and left the room . " I can understand everything , " said Nahum , " except where she got all that hate from . A young girl like her , with such a sparkle in her eyes , such love of life , such exuberanceand all of a sudden , a snarl of hatred . " " I 'm terribly sorry , Nahum , " Sara whispered . " The Amarillos have n't brought you much luck . " " You are all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gracia threw a fit in front of Sara . " It 's all because of you . It 's you , you who taught her to run around with men and put ideas in her head . Once a girl starts up with a man ... " " She can never stop , mother , is n't that so ? " Within three months Ofra officially moved in with von Kluck . Some time later she told her family that she was going with him to Paris . In Paris there was real culture and really cultured people who knew how to live . And just so Gracia should set her mind at ease , they were planning to get married as soon as they solved the problem of religion . " You 'll never guess what , Professor Barzel , " said Sara in the staff room one morning . " Von Kluck refused to become Jewish and Ofra refused to become Christian , so the two of them went to the kadi and became Moslems , and he married them . They 're Muhammad and Hadija von Kluck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything happens in this city of ours , " sighed the doctor . " I 'm sure it was Alfred 's idea . But it was n't nice of him not to invite me . " " I was n't invited either . Ofra informed us by mail . After the fact . My one hope is that we do n't find out that von Kluck 's father is a fez cleaner too . " " You wo n't . I know the family . Prussians . His mother runs a dog kennel . "  | " Ofra never could stand dogs . I wish her luck . " " Amen . I just hope Elder Amarillo does n't take it too badly . " But Grandfather Amarillo had no time to take it badly , because that Saturday he was run over by a furniture truck near his home . He never knew what hit him . He had n't even bothered to look , because in all his life no truck had ever gone down the alleyway before , certainly not on a Sabbath . Elder Amarillo 's black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhood as they followed the bier . Miracolo Orientale transported the coffin in his hearse in grand style . He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High , he sang out loud , wiping the tears from his eyes , who abides in the shadow of the Almighty . Even the Cordosos followed the coffin all the way to the Mount of Olives , where a new tombstone was added to the rows of gray monuments scattered over the hill like silent sheep . Sara , heavy with child , felt as though the last bridge connecting her with herself had been cut . A swollen river raged through her streets . Gracia had no intention of becoming a grandmother so suddenly . She took the inheritance money " You 'll manage by yourself , Sara , you always do " and went off with Madame Savvidopoulos and her unmarriageable daughters to Cyprus . All the contours of Sara 's childhood had vanished within one year . When her firstborn son , Hillel , arrived and was given her to hold for a while in his swaddling clothes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lack of her father and grandfather had seemed most acute of all during the birth . The small gift in her arms made the lack worse . Bless him , Grandfather , she prayed , holding the no-longer-bawling infant protectively near her , wherever you are , Grandfather , and I do n't begin to know where that is , bless him from there . Ask whoever needs to be asked , because you know and I do n't , to look after my son Hillel . Try to hear me , Grandfather , because I 've never felt so defenseless before . Help me.  | " That 's enough , " said the nurse . " Let 's have him back . Both you and he need to rest . " " Just one more second . " She looked at him and counted his fingers one by one . The eyes were closed . An engraved , shut , absorbed slit of a mouth . Still remembering what other earth dwellers had long forgotten . Still half-living there , the latest messenger from a fogbound world , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to converse with mortals . Only in a few weeks ' time would he begin to get used to them , to open , to shine , to get to know , to forge a new life . A hostage . At night she soared over the rooftops with him , took nonstop express trains to the stars and beyond , searched for wizards and fortune-tellers to consult , beseeched the pity of all creatures , all who were wiser than she . She nursed him apprehensively . Yet from the start Hillel proved to be a most manly baby who could manage quite well without all her motherly fears . He sucked lustily and cried in a deep bass voice , giving fierce vent to his protests . His hair was black already , strong , like Sara 's own . Later on , when Noam and Nadav were born , Sara no longer felt quite so primitively defenseless . Elias agreed with her . " The first child forces you to define yourself , " he said . " When the second comes , you 're already defined . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't , you can be sure that 's what your child will learn to demand from you . I was very critical of my own father from an early age . " Elias liked to spend time with the children , to walk and to talk with them . Unknown to Sara he kept a diary in which he recorded all the stages of their development . For some reason he refused to show it to her , or even to tell her about it . He was afraid she might think it intrinsically opposed to the process of growth , a vain attempt to translate the untranslatable into mere words . Yet once he began to know his own mind , Hillel preferred his father 's to his mother 's company . He was less earthy than she and more forgiving .  | Sara stopped working at the hospital . She and Hulda wheeled their carriages together . " Tell me , Sara , does it make any difference that you and Elias are cousins ? " " Yes . A lot . It creates a kind of tribal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the bad Amarillos , the ones who are always quarreling with life . Elias is from the good Amarillos . Still , it 's nice to have a common ancestor . " " My mother once had a cleaning woman who was born in Nebi Samwil and married a man from Lifta . They were married for nearly forty years , and had lots of children , but when anyone asked her about her husband , she would say : How can I possibly know him , he 's not from my family . ' " " There 's something to that . " There is a moment right after sunset when the stones of the city grow terribly pale , like a man at the end of his strength , waiting in spent silence to be transported as he is to whatever lies beyond . Night then falls with softly stunning kindness , a blessing certain and swift . One adjusts one 's breathing to its breath ; each street and its houses , each house and its breathers , attending their nocturnal fate . On such nights Sara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matrimonial , as she liked to say to herself , and imagined that the steps of her house led infallibly down to the sea . Suppose the whole street should suddenly lift up and be washed ashore in Brindisi ? She was certain she had once been in Brindisi , in another incarnation perhaps , had sat there in the twilight behind bolted shutters in an embroidered , wine-colored dress , a yellow citron lustrous on a table , her head shaven beneath its wig , listening to the sound of seawater as it lapped against the steps of her house . On the subject of reincarnation , Elias was sure that he had lived in Jerusalem in Herod 's time and had been trampled to death there by a horse-drawn chariot in a narrow alley . In his nightmares he saw the horse bearing wildly down on him and the frightened eyes of the char-  | ioteer ; he felt the wall against him , sudden and hard , and knew he could back off no farther . The dream kept recurring . He felt at home , so he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ruined towers of Phasael and Antonia with their margined , finely dressed stones . A toga would have befit his tall frame . His sad , knowledgeable mouth could have spoken all the tongues of that complicated city without tripping . Greek sounded well on Elias . Not the Greek of Madame Savvidopoulos , but the blunt , wise , stinging Greek of those times . No city lives closer to the almost visible ghosts of past lives than Jerusalem ; no city is better at blind , secret love . Hermetic , ironic , a sink of cold tempests , the city stands upright on the mountain against the cold night , most strong and most vulnerable , something in it never falling asleep . All places outside of it are like a somehow undeserved vacation . Or is there any place at all outside of Jerusalem ? And once , on a nearly violet-skied autumn night , when sleepers lay most unprotected , an abyss surrounding each bed , Sara managed to see Elias 's horse in her dream and to feel the hard wall at her back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounding till morning , while the waves of the city washed over them again and again with a harsh , moonlike obstinacy . Toward evening the setting sun takes possession of Elias Amarillo 's white room , illuminating his head as it bends over documents . Sara brings his coffee up to him , with a glass of arak and a glass of cold water by its side . It is forbidden to sit in the living room below ; Noam has five winkies , invisible creatures that no one can see but himself , and whenever anyone sits on a chair , or the couch , he wails : " A-y-y ! Get up quick ! You 're sitting on a winky ! " Which means that the sitter has to get to his feet and escort the winky outside , a task that is by no means simple , inasmuch as it can not he seen . Lately Hillel refuses to see the winkies to the door . He has simply outgrown them .  | Sometimes Noam makes a fuss : " They do n't want to leave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entreaty and formal persuasion to get rid of them . " There 'll be loads of fruit this year , " says Elias Amarillo , sipping cold water as he looks down at the garden from his second-floor room . " Grandfather would have loved to see it . " The crenellated Old City wall near the Damascus Gate can be seen well from Elias 's room , though not the young rowdies who have taken to congregating beneath it and accosting non-Arab women : " Madam , come with me to Ramallah , I will show you Nablus , Madam . " Nor can you see Subhi Bey 's slim-shouldered , bitter-souled brother , old Hajj Kama ad-Din , as he walks with heavy heart and courtly steps to prayer at the Sheikh Lulu mosque . " Hail Kamal , ya dayus , ba ' al-balad bil filuss , " the children chant after him , the traitor Kamal is selling Jerusalem for money . But it is not money that he wants , it is peace . Over and over he tries to persuade the Jewish leaders to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on calling rescue work . What are they so afraid will happen to all those Jews in Europe ? Hajj Kamal knows Europe well ; it is a civilized place . And without immigration there will be quiet in Palestine . Truly there will be . Only nobody wants to listen to him . Even Mr. Shertok of the Jewish Agency , who had grown up among Arabs in Ein-Sinya , refuses to lend an ear . The western light grazes the wall and the roof of the Church of the Dormition , then fades like a last reverberation of brass cymbals.  | SHOTS AT NIGHT AGAIN . Not a night without them . The victims are found stripped of their identities , cast bloodily like empty sacks in some shot-up car on the road , or in their own homes far from town . A young couple in the street . A family in an isolated house on a slope leading out of the city . More shots . Who is it this time ? Where ? People stiffen silently in their houses , listening out into the night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounded , heavy , hurting . The innocence of a budding branch in the morning brings tears to one 's eyes . So frail . Anyone could step on it , break it , uproot it , and run away . The streets are filled with malice . The children cover their heads with blankets , afraid to fall asleep , until a dreamless slumber comes and takes them , though it gives them no rest . Walking through Mahaneh Yehuda , Elias Amarillo sees armored plates being riveted to the front of a bus . " Lie-ber-man ! God speed , Lie-ber-man ! " shouts the sooty-faced Yemenite welder to the driver . Lieberman , fat and balding , raises his hand in a brief salute , a cap-  | tain whose passengers ' lives are in his hands . He wedges his broad hottom into the driver 's seat and switches on the motor . " Three Arab roadblocks have been cleared near Lydda , " a young dispatcher with a cap on his head tells him quietly , resting an elbow on the open window of the bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into beyond that . Did you have any trouble on your way here ? " " Just some stone throwing . One broken windowpane . " " Well , have a good trip . " The passengers huddle behind the bulletproof shades of the bus . They sit their children away from the sides , on baskets and suitcases in the aisle . They do n't say much . Elias is at war with his own inner demons . All his instincts tell him to back the forces of existing order , to stay aboveboard and avoid clandestine bodies , to keep faith . He knows that he was n't cut out to be a Lieberman , that it simply is n't like him to go zigzagging at crazy speeds with a bus full of passengers through some Arab roadblock before too many shots can be fired . His fortes are his patience and stubborn trust . Thin , anxious , long-legged , he often goes to meetings of the Brith Shalom , where he chats with Professor Buber and Hajj Kamal ad-Din amid pleasantly intellectual surroundings . The suited , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General 's office are his friends . Standing before a wigged British judge , they all feel like brothers . My learned colleague Elias . My distinguished friend Tewfik . Still , there are fissures . He feels as if some part of him has been altered , and one morning , as though under duress , he asks Sara what she thinks of changing their last name to Amir . It sounds more Hebrew , he says to her , embarrassed . She agrees right away . Since her grandfather 's death , the name Amarillo no longer means much to her . She sees little of Gracia , who has meanwhile returned to Jerusalem , or of her pudgy mother-in-law , Allegra , who occasionally sends them jars of olives and olive oil from Tiberias , to say nothing of all her tias and tios scattered throughout  | Jerusalem . Hillel is enthusiastic about the change . By the standards of the Ashkenazi school he now attends , Amir is certainly a nicer name than Amarillo . His teacher Tsippora thinks so too . Botanically derived names are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is right in keeping with the style . One evening , after a hard day 's work treating casualties at the hospital , a day of amputations and unavoidable deaths , Dr. Barzel , smelling of disinfectant and wearing a white surgeon 's hat that made him look like a butcher , passed down a corridor where a group of men stood praying , one of whom asked him to don a prayer shawl and join in reciting blessings and psalms . His anger , which had been building up all day and had only barely been restrained from giving vent to blows or to tears , suddenly burst forth . " I have no time to waste on prayers , " he snapped at the old man who approached him . The latter was not offended . " Doctor , if you should one day die at the ripe old age of one hundred and twenty yourself , and reach the gates of heaven ... " " If I ever get to heaven , which I very much doubt , I 'll tell whoever is responsible for this revolting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have planned things more mercifully . There 's a sadist up there , that 's what there is , and there 's no point asking him for favors . You make me laugh . I have nothing but contempt for you and your carryings-on . Why do n't you all go help the nurses mop the floor in the emergency room instead ? " " We ca n't know what all His calculations are , " the old man said placatingly . " If he has calculations that he is n't telling anyone about , then he 's simply a rotten commander . " " The doctor has been working hard to save lives , " a young yeshiva student said . " The Law states that a mourner is n't responsible for what he says while his dead are still before him . May his sins be for-given . " Dr. Barzel almost physically tore into him . " What 's sin ? It 's just a word . You might as well say it backward . Nis ! Nis ! Where does it get you ? "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctor ? " the old man asked in amazement . " I know , I know . " He waved his speckled hands like a large red heron . His wits were not about him and he needed to get away . He walked into the darkened garden of the hospital and lit a cigarette . His shoes were still caked with blood . We must learn to go from the abstract to the practical , he told himself , feeling chaosall of us . In a sense he had already made the transition in medical school ; yet he had left himself his redemptive outs therethey all had . Medicine had never before seemed in contradiction to soul making , which Professor Barzel had always considered a wholly abstract occupation . And now ? Secretively , stubbornly , suicidally , Professor Barzel went from crisis to crisis without anyone knowing about itnot even Hulda , who was too busy with her daughter to guess . He felt all of a sudden that he had given too freely to the life all around him , that in his unreserved and uncalculated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been too soft and lubricious ; he had failed to sharpen himself , to learn to concentrate on a single end . Somewhere he 'd left a flank unprotected . Heretofore , even though he had never thought of returning there , he had felt covered by the presence of a strong , enlightened Europe at his back . Now his Europe toothe opera house of Memphishad crumbled into nothing . It made him wonder what it could have amounted to in the first place . And being the quintessential European , it made him wonder what he amounted to himself . " I do n't have to tell you what it means , " he said to Amatsia , wringing his hands . " There 's no Europe anymore . " " For me there never was , " said Amatsia , bemused . He noticed that his brother-in-law 's hair had begun to turn very white . The world was no longer the same for Professor Barzel : he met it suspiciously now , warily . The eternal duel with death in the hospital seemed to him pointless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man with his jailers on the eve of his execution . His love of  | life was an emptied bag of tricks . Hulda with her emotionalism , her dishes that kept dropping and breaking , seemed insignificant to him , small , and ultimately , tiresome . At times her peals of laughter reminded him of the bleatings of a hysterical goat . Only Nili was still somehow miraculous , but even she , he told himself , cracking his knuckles in the deep black armchair in his room where he sat without turning on the lights , was a gratuitous miracle , without substance . Nothing human seemed substantial anymorewhile of a God who transcended questions and challenges , he was n't able , or willing , or going , to hear . At least three times a day he planned his own death with marvelous precisionand no one had any idea . Were he to shut the door of his office in the hospital and bite off the tip of the cyanide capsule that he kept in his drawer , it would be considered a tragic accident , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself ? His accidie was indefinable , intangible . I 'm suffering from a miracle deficiency , howled Professor Barzel to himself , diagnosing his pain as he felt itand from an unbreakable addiction to hope . Maybe the postman will pull a lightning bolt out of his satchel tomorrow . Maybe I 'll find a shred of prophecy at the bottom of Hulda 's shopping basket , underneath the tomatoes . Maybe an epoch is about to end and another to begin . Professor Barzel wrote , this time in Hebrew : Will we wake again this morning with dry mouths ? The coming wave will wash away the pain . Look : the body opens like an eye , and silently , a sea anemone , awaits the kingly hour and the distant gust . Now let the signal be . The word will become flesh . Through this dryness there will flow a living sea . Epiphany . Epiphany . Epiphany . The days passed without revelation . His mother wrote bad news from Frankfurt . Their property had been confiscated . Most of their Jewish friends had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while his Aryan colleague Professor Reichenbach was too scared for his own skin to be of any help . Dr. Barzel pulled what strings he could and procured an immigration visa to Palestine , but it still was n't easy to get his mother out . The Germans , Frau Barzel wrote with anger and hurt , kept demanding the most absurd documents from her , such as a certificate that she was free of lice , or a notarized statement that she had received a nonexistent vaccination at the age of three . It was a farce , a scandal , a bad joke , all simply to extort from her what money she had left , for the greater power and glory of the Third Reich . He bit his nails in the dead of night while Hulda was asleep , certain that his mother would never be allowed to leave . He developed insomnia . He sensed strange presences in the house , for which he could find no better description than such banal words as old age , sickness , malaise , imprisonment , death . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . I 'm not a believer , Professor Heinz Barzel fought with himself , so why do I have such feelings of sin ? such expectations of a miracle ? I 've been hexed , he would say to himself every morning : off to work with you , Bimbi . But it was n't any use . Despairing of sleep , at three o'clock in the morning , despairing of all intimacy with Hulda , he shut the windows , turned on his heavy table lamp whose globe was the color of egg white , and read Holderlin , or wrote : Who else skims on the air of the room , cutting its dark planes with a motionless motion ? A face in the mirror . The mirror opens up . Old age rises slowly out of the four corners . Who are you ? A passerby in your house , surrounded by presence . All your alonenesses are at fault , you echo of no sound .  | At fault , at fault ! There 's nothing in your bulging fist . Before you can know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand shall vanish . It dawned on him that in order to go on living he would have to sacrifice most of himself . He was n't sure whether life at the price of such self-abandonment was really a sacred commandment , but he was n't convinced of the opposite either . I 'm not authentic , Professor Barzel said to himself , I cast a solid image of myself in Frankfurt and in Heidelberg , and now I 'm trying to force my way into it in a different time and a different place . I am not the medical savior of mankind , nor the all-round Renaissance man , nor the universal mind . In the Persian Gulf I could get away with it , but not here in Jerusalem . This city abides no one 's decision about who they are . It decides for them , it makes them , with the pressure of stones and infinite time . It teaches humility . But after humility , what ? " Bimbi , you must n't work so hard , you look terrible , look at yourself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of father are you to Nili ? " Starved for greatness , crying for a miracle , Doctor Barzel was a shadow of his former self . He threw himself into his work as though nothing else existed ; for the first time in his adult life he found himself living within the narrow sphere of his profession alone . The bloodshed hardened him . The fear that gripped the city , the screaming headlines in the newspapers , gave him a gray , quotidien , unbreakable strength . Jerusalem seemed no longer a perpetual holiday to him and had become a tough secular reality instead . At times when trouble broke out he rarely bothered to return home from the hospital . Holderlin and the violin were forgotten . He talked only about his work . He even abandoned his famous philosophical lectures at the hospital , as though he had lost the key to them . " You 're committing workicide , " said Hulda sadly . But he was n't really . He had just stopped thinking of himself , had skipped right over himself . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark nights of the soul was that of the long , ugly war at the hospital , a war without  | outcome , without choice . He felt like someone emerging from a period of mourning without ever having known what it was that he had mourned for . Imperceptibly , his relations with the younger doctors had improved . They were partners . An early afternoon sky : at the zenith a Prussian blue , breaking off into laundry blue , the color that houses are plastered throughout the Levant . Along the ridgelines , touched with haze , the pale , opaque blue of plumbago blossoms . The squatting city is the color of flesh . Sara sits on Victoria 's balcony with Hillel and Noam at her knees . The two women watch Elder Cordoso coming home below , huffing and puffing with importance like his politician son Leon . " Just look at him hop , " says Victoria . " Like chickpeas in a frying pan . " " They say he 's been meeting lately with Hajj Kamal ad-Din . They 're trying to form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city . Elias has gone a few times too . " " What can come of it ? These days every Jew has his Arab , and every Arab has his Jew . They sit around adoring each other . " " Does anyone ever see Faiza ? " " Nobody . They say that she 's shut herself up in their house in Jericho and never goes out . Imagine , Jericho in midsummer ! And Subhi 's in Alexandria . One really ought to write Faiza a letter . " " Another one of those things one ought to do and never does . " " You 're tired , Sarika . " " Dead tired . Everything is so . . . small . Everyone lives in his own little box . There are more dangerous boxes and less dangerous boxes , but they 're all still so small , Victoria . We keep thwarting each other , everything keeps getting in everything 's way . " " If I were your mother , " says Victoria irrelevantly , or perhaps not so , " I 'd come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let my mother be . " In fact , Gracia had become quite impossible . Even in her sunglasses , even in her huge hats , she could no longer keep up the image of the  | romantic widow , the abandoned Senora Amarillo who was once Tony Crowther 's great love . Her legs swelled . A second chin grew under the first . Her body gave off a scent of lavender , candies , and medicine , a smell of aging female hate . Her hands clawed the clothes of whoever sat next to her . She was sure that others were better off than herself , that everyone but she had all the money , the possessions , the pasatiempos , that their hearts desired . She kept a hungry ear to the world , certain that she alone was being had , that she was missing out because she was such a soft touch . I let myself be pushed around , she would say , that 's always been my problem , that I let myself be pushed around . Only her voice remained as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rare season of the year , You are my soul , you are my very eyes . Tony Crowther no longer had the time to drop in very much . Elizabeth Barzel arrived . Hulda told Sara about it over the telephone : " We 'd been waiting so many years for this hapless refugee , and she really had a hard time over there , she was even beaten up in the street before she leftand here , there turns up this tight-mouthed little old lady with kid gloves who throws a scene the very first time she hears me call Bimbi Bimbi . What kind of name is that , she says , my son 's name is Heinz , Heinz Barzel . You can call him Heinzchen , but Bim-bi ? . . . The next thing she did was tell Nili to call her Omi ' instead of Savta . ' And , oh , I forgot to tell you , she also started calling Nili Ursula . It had completely slipped our minds that after she was horn we 'd received a letter from Elizabeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgot about it , and me , you know what a coward I am , I wrote her that we 'd given the child a middle name , Ursula Nili . I took Nili aside and said to her , Look , Nili , Omi 's an old woman and she 'd like to call you Ursula , it 's a name that she likes , do you mind ? ' Well , you know Nili 's an angel , she said right away that she did n't . So we had an Omi and an Ursula , and everything was just fine for three days , until the old lady began to catch on that Ursula was  | not exactly Nili 's real name . She thought and thought until she said over supper one night with tears in her eyes , ' Na , ja , I can see that her real name is Nilithat 's how it is when you 're a stranger in a new country and have to get used to all kinds of things . ' You wo n't believe it , Sara , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dope that I am , I said to her right there at the table : No , no , we really call her Ursula too , do n't we , Ursula ? ' But she just kept shaking her head and saying no , it was n't Ursula anymore , it was Nili . And she pronounced the word Nili like it was a bullet she was shooting us with . She sat there with tears in her righteous eyes , and so help me , we all felt like heels . But wait , there 's more to come . A few days later Nili came to me and said , Imma , when will we shut Omi up in the bath-room ? ' I asked her what had happened . It turns out that Nili had said something to her that she did n't like , and so she spanked her and locked her up in the bathroom . Bimbi and I nearly went out of our minds . Bimbi let her have it . In the choicest German . He told her that she 'd better not behave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . They 're always calling each other names , you know . Elizabeth once hit Bimbi with a broomstick because he walked into her room . And do you think Nili cares about it all ? She said to me , What is abba getting so mad about ? Omi likes shutting people up in the bathroom , so what ? ' What can I tell you , Sara , I love Bimbi , and I love Nili , and Elizabeth ca n't get out of here a minute too soon for me , so that the three of us can be alone again . Why the hell do people have mothers ? And now we 'll be stuck with her until . . . until she dies . " But they were n't stuck with Elizabeth Barzel , because she got married instead . Within four months of her arrival she became the bride of old Professor Marcus . The two of them had a joint age of nearly one hundred and fifty . Hulda got emotional at the wedding and could n't stop kissing them both . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very elegant in a short veil and tailored cocktail dress , scolded the cantor because his shirt was stained , criticized the flower arrangement , which she thought Asiatic , and carried on royally . For a woman her age , marveled Hulda , she 's really sensational , is n't she ? Bimbi said that was all well and fine , but he was damned if he was going to start  | calling Professor Marcus " Pappi . " Marcus agreed that this would be absurd , and suggested that he be called " Onkel " instead . In the end the two men stood in a corner and talked shop during most of the wedding party , calling each other Herr Kollege and Herr Professor as usual . At exactly ten o'clock Frau Professor Marcus collected her gloves and her husband and said , " Ladies and gentlemen , thank you very much , and now we 'd better all be going home , had n't we ? " " She looks marvelous , " said the guests , watching her climb into the waiting automobile in her elegant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show a face as strong as life itself . Just five months before she had been slapped in the streets of Frankfurt am Main and had lost all her property there . Hulda wailed into Bimbi 's handkerchief . Weddings always made her cry . Two weeks after the wedding , when Professor Marcus went for a ride in their car without informing her first , Frau Professor Marcus called the police to tell them he had stolen it . Fortunately , the Arab desk sergeant who picked up the telephone understood none of the languages that she spoke to him . By the time someone was found to take down the complaint , Professor Marcus was back with the car , at a loss to understand what the fuss was all about . " The car is joint property , " said the Frau Professor . " If you take it anywhere , you have to ask my permission first . " The world-famous Professor Marcus , holder of numerous international prizes , admired her more than anyone he had ever admired before . She became an almost legendary figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one more incredible than the other , each of them ending with the same flabbergasted sigh of a smile : she 's incredible . One hot , dry day that summer , when the headlines of the newspapers seemed to tire of shouting their letters as big as black windows , several young Jews from the neighborhood jumped the Arab newsboy from Malha who sold La Bourse Egyptienne on the corner and beat him up savagely .  | " That little kid who sits on the corner and chirps La Bourse , La Bourse ? " asked Sara , repelled . " That 's the one , " said Victoria . " Ten years old and looks like eight . And the leader of our gang of heroes was none other than Hayyim Cordoso . Kicked him right in the stomach with his well-shod feet . Smashed one of his kidneys or something . We 're as disgraced as they now . This whole city is crazy . " When Elias heard about it , he started as though bit by a snake . " Victoria , are you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you willing to swear to it in court ? Because I 'll have to call on you to testify . " " Como no . Leon 's son , I 've known him since he was a baby . He was always a little stinker . I 'll swear on a stack of Bibles . Miracolo saw him too , go ask him . " A few days later Elias returned home tired and depressed . " It 's impossible to file a complaint against Cordoso junior . " " Why ? " " I do n't know . The British decided to close the case . For lack of public interest . " " Maybe he works for them ? " " Maybe . I have n't felt so sick to my stomach for a long time . " Sir Reginald Welsley-More , pipe in hand , sticks his finger into the cage and pokes a nail into the plumage of the frightened , cornered bird . " Coochey-coochey , " he says , blowing smoke at it . " What is it , sir ? " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a bandook . It 's part canary , part finch . Or vice versa . The Towels breed them . I just bought it an hour ago , for Angela . It has a fine voice , but it wo n't do us the honor of letting us hear it . Coochey-coochey , " he pokes it again . Through the bars one can see the bird panting in shallow , frightened waves . " I believe the cage is a bit small for her , sir . " " You do , do you , now ? We 'll tell Starkie to bring a bigger one . " Sir Reginald sits down in his chair . " Have a seat , Tony . I have some news  | for you . In light of your brilliant success in Jerusalem " his voice takes on a sarcastic note that reminds Tony more than anything of the teachers in public school " and inasmuch as you have proven yourself lately so indispensable for the advancement of His Majesty 's Intelligence Service , there is a proposal on my desk to transfer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " India , y'know , that unimportant little country in the lousy belly of Asia . Endemic cholera and all that . Fresh chutney , not Fortnum and Mason 's . A new world for you , Captain Crowther . An excellent opportunity . " " Is that final , sir , or am I permitted to appeal ? " " Ah , Tony , Tony , how can you ask that ? You know that His Majesty 's Army would n't do a thing to hurt your feelings . You do know that we want our officers to be as happy as can be , do n't you ? " " Then I can think it over ? " " Think it over all you want , man , as long as you 're on the plane to India on the thirtieth of this month . Via Bahrein . " He bangs a fist on the table and shifts tone . " You ca n't say you have n't been warned , Captain Crowther . I have here before me four warnings of the most explicit sort . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the fourteenth of this month you received a tip from your informant that there was an arms cache hidden in his neighborhood . You knew all about it , Captain Crowther , yet you did n't make a move until the twenty-second , when you found absolutely nothing . You have n't been a very successful intelligence officer , have you , Captain Crowther ? " " I 've done my best , sir . You 're quite right , sir . " " Between the two of us , Tony , I do n't pretend to understand you . De gustibus and all that , you know , but what pleasure you find in this country of sun and flies , between the Towels , and the Beards , is beyond me . I 've seen native-lovers in my years in the service , but you 're quite the most incorrigible case I 've come across yet . Starkie at least enjoys buggering the little Towels in the halls of the YMCA , but to the best of my knowledge that 's not how your tastes incline . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Welsley-More crossed his legs . " Two delegations came to see me yesterday . First the Towels came to inform me with holy wrath that the Beards had brought a bench and folding chairs to sit on by their Wailing Wall , thus constituting an infringement of the status quo in the holy places . Then the Beards came to tell me that the Towels have been knocking over their bench and violating the sanctity of their holy site . Each side requested a decision in its favor . " " What did you decide , sir ? " " Strictly by the book , Tony , strictly by the book . The status quo in such cases is clear enough . The introduction of any bloody bench or bloody chair to a disputed site is categorically forbidden . Just last week the Copts and the Armenians , or some such blokes , were here to see me regarding the status quo of three floor tilesthree whole floor tiles , mind youin the Holy Sepulchre . I was asked to decide which of the two sects had the right to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bench , though , the Beards say that they need it for old people who are fasting , pregnant women , and so forth . I simply ca n't be involved with all that . As far as I 'm concerned , they need n't fast or get pregnant at all . " " A very Roman decision , sir . " Reginald Welsley-More squinted sharply over his pipe at Tony . " You 're a clever bastard , Tony , but I 'm no Pontius Pilate , for the simple reason that there will never be another Jesus here . That 's precisely what you fail to see . All grandeur is gone from here forever . Nothing will ever happen here again , Tony , nothing of any importance . The flies have eaten it all . This is an obnoxious , petty little land , consumed by religious and irreligious rivalries that will never be resolved . Hundreds of years from now they 'll still be fighting here over benches at walls and floor tiles in churches . It 's a decrepit , deadend place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't even realize it . In the best of cases this city will survive as a museum , an antiquarium for lovers of the past . If it were n't for our forcing them to build in stone here , they 'd already have turned this place into a concrete marketplace , a second Tel Aviv . Or into a second filthy Amman . Go to India , old chap , there you 'll see things in perspective , you 'll real-  | ize their proper magnitude . Amid all these little quarrels and fanaticism , with one sect maddening another and the sun maddening them all , one tends to forget . " " I believe , sir , that I 'll put in a request for a discharge . " Sir Reginald is taken aback . " Good Lord , Tony , what will you do in mufti ? Go to work behind a desk in some miserable little town ? " " I really do n't know yet myself , sir . " Tony Crowther applies for his discharge , goes off to England for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can not seem to get comfortable in . Though his shoulders are less impressive than before , there remains something military about his bearing . His friends , Jews and Arabs , gape , congratulate him , love him as before , and procure him the job he desires in the music department of the Palestine Broadcasting Service , where Husni works as an announcer . Tony likes nothing better than to go every day to the old building in its luxurious garden on Queen Melissanda Street . He loves the ponderous feel of the soundproof studio doors , the special , cavelike smell of the recording chamber , the businesslike atmosphere of the control room , the cacophony of the record library in which everyone sits in his own corner listening to the music of his choice , the clocks that rule , inexorable , from the walls . What an enormous lever , he once remarks , it takes to lift a flower on the air . His own specialty at the station is classical ballet , a subject that had always been a favorite . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes drops in on them after a broadcast . Once he relates : " Last night I was in the middle of playing Tchaikovsky 's Swan Lake during my ballet show , when a technician rings me up from the control room . What 's wrong , Captain Crowther , I can hardly hear you ! ' It was right during the pianissimo , when the viola could break your heart . I 'm terribly sorry , old man , ' I said , it is n't my fault , it 's Tchaikovsky 's . " Who ? ' he says , all in a rage . Jukovsky ? Put him on the inside line and I 'll give him a piece of my mind ! What the devil is he doing in the studio during a broadcast anyway ? ' "  | At last Tony feels that things are beginning to move . He and Elizabeth Marcus become active in Jerusalem 's musical life . Tony organizes a choir , which within a few months of his discharge he is already putting through its paces , with more enthusiasm than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes to organizing record concerts at the YMCA , sometimes in the auditorium and sometimes in the twilight garden outside . Elizabeth does n't miss a single concert . She brings all the scores and follows with her finger . " He 's finally found himself , " says Hulda . " But first he had to lose himself , " says Bimbi . " Like all of us . A true Jerusalem metamorphosis . " " And yet he 's also getting to be more and more like a fussy old bachelor . One never noticed it when he was in uniform . " Busily , benevolently , smilingly brimming with small , unpretentious love , Tony Crowther , intelligence officer manque , Jerusalem 's very own , galumphs through the streets of the city with a briefcase full of records , notes , and musical announcements . An ocean of music foams through him in great waves and keeps on going . In his pleasant little room that looks out on the Old City his loneliness never reaches cosmic proportions . Occasionally he tipples a bit , by himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cordoso ? " Sara asks a boy whom she has helped to his feet on Hassolel Street . He had fallen and scraped his knee while running . He grins . " You bet . " " Which one ? " " Ya'akov . " " Hayyim 's son ? " " Uziel 's . Hayyim 's uncle . " " What do you do all day , Ya'akov Cordoso ? " " I go to my Grandpa 's Talmud Torah .

The only one who was the right age for me , Hayyim , did n't appeal to me . And besides , there was someone else then .

" There is an announcement in the paper that Subhi Bey 's daughter Suhaila , now principal of a school , appears on the Royal Honours List for her extraordinary contribution to the education of Moslem girls . Her Jewish friends send flowers and congratulations . None of them come to the ceremony .

" The nerve of that pipsqueak , " she says out loud for him to hear as  | she runs water into the bucket . " Him and me , what a laugh ! The poor little bird . A one-man holy burial society . " Miracolo does n't give up . Not long after , he brings Victoria a fancily wrapped present . She opens it to find a pink nightgown covered with ribbons and pink muslin butterflies . " I 'll bet you stripped it off a corpse , " says Victoria . " Victoria , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asks . " I never thought you could be so mean . I come to you respectfully , with honorable intentions , and you treat me , God forbid , like dirt . " Victoria folds up the nightgown and hands it back to him . " Do n't you go buying me any more nightgowns , Nissim . And do n't you go imagining me in them either , because it wo n't get you anywhere . Besides , you might as well know that pink is a color for whores . Take it to Sa'ada , she 'll know how to thank you . " Nissim Mizrachi is mortified . The truth of the matter is that Sa'ada herself had picked the gown out for him . He 'd met her by the door of a lingerie shop , where he was standing too embarrassed to enter , and had shyly asked her to buy it for him . She had even bought it at a discount .

La Madelon pour nous servir a boire , Quand on lui prend la taille et le rnenton Elie rit , c'est tout ce qu'elle sait le faire Madelon , Madelon , Madelon . A truckload of drunken Australians in ten-gallon hats pulled up outside the Edison Theater , by a corset-and-brassiere shop . They barged inside and bought out the store , showering the counter with pound notes before the eyes of the half-shocked , halfdelirious lady shopkeeper . Back in their truck they slipped over their uniforms pink brassieres , stiff fishbone girdles covered with roses , lewdly glittering black silk garters , all the comic and vulgar private underworld of women . The whole street applauded them , saluting when they broke into a hoarse , tipsy rendition of " God Save the King . " " And I want you to know , Sara , " Elias told her , " it was really like running up the flag . I know that sounds crazy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end ? " " Four jeeploads of MPs came along and made them take it all off after a pitched battle . Then they arrested them all . Contempt of His Majesty 's uniform , you understand . They surrounded the truck with their jeeps and escorted it off in a convoy . The shopkeeper ran into the street and collected everything in baskets . Baskets and baskets of pink and black silk . It was terribly sad when it ended . That was the solemnest military ceremony I 've ever seen . And the truest . " Miracolo Orientale was a worried man . For some time now he had suspected that someone was signaling to the enemy with a flashlight from the roofs of the city , yet each time he ran outside to have a look , the mysterious lights would mockingly disappear . He had already informed the police several times , but the latter , in typical foot-dragging fashion , had done nothing . They 're nincompoops , Miracolo groused , until one of those fat slobs gets himself upon a roof , twenty spies could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were slowfooted and that a spy must be spry . There was no choice left but for Miracolo himself to take to the rooftops and catch the criminals singlehandedly before they spelled the doom of the entire city . Night after night , skinny and sad-faced , Miracolo prepared himself a cup of strong coffee , washed it down with a jigger of arak , clapped a dark beret on his head , wrapped himself up in a dark , cloaklike coat , and sallied forth from roof to roof like a pessimistic alley cat . He became an expert on roofs . He knew who was drying raisins and who clumps of figs , who was putting up hay for his animals and who needed to have his water tank retarred . He knew whose roof was piled high with torn old mattresses , their insides long spilled out , and who had lovingly assembled a junk collection on top of his house : straw hassocks and chairs that could no longer be repaired , broken table legs and stoves , closet doors and dustpans , chamberpots and old upholstery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their nights beneath the open canopy of a sky strewn with ripe stars that could almost be touched . More than once in the course of his perambulations he had stopped to look silently , inquiringly , upon such  | trysters as they lay baring themselves to the heavens . More than once , too , he had had to restrain himself from whistling with surprise , because some of the couples he saw were most unexpected . Such investigations , however , were strictly a side pursuit . The object remained to catch the signaling spies . Often it seemed to him that he could make out the flicker of their flashlight on a far-off roof ; there it was , unmistakable , dashdotdashdot ; yet no matter how quickly he covered the distance , he never found more than an empty roof beneath a glorious sky whose inky blue tint was dribbled blackly on the horizons by the thin brushes of the cypress trees . The whole city was at his feet . He began to love Jerusalem from above , sprawling in the darkness . Most roofs could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not by means of an exterior staircase , then by leaping from a terrace , a high stretch of wall , the hefty trunk of a fig tree , or the reddish clustered branches of a pepper tree . Each time he came home , tired and disappointed , he would have to brush from his coat , after a brief , restless sleep that lasted till morning light , the rooftop debris that had clung to it : bits of sparrows ' or bulbuls ' nests , the crushed , staining leaves of stinking acacia , rusty metal tacks , little red peppercorns . And yet it all seemed worthwhile to him in those hours when he felt like the city 's aerial lord . They 're all asleep , the poor , tired darlings , he would say to himself with prodigal royal compassion ; let them sleep , let them sleep , as long as I 'm here to watch over them . It occurred to him that he was now two whole levels above the dead whom he helped bury during the day , for they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a land of ultimate silence , underneath the apartments , the markets , the automobiles , the school buildings , while he was on the top floor , closer to heavenly things and high secrets of which few men knew , to the uppermost kabbalistic spheres in which the Shekinah merged with Tifereth and the divine black light was conceived . Months went sleeplessly by without his once laying hands on the accursed signalers . Finally one night he decided to outwit them . He took a flashlight himself and began to flick it on and off to get them to  | reveal themselves : dashdotdotdash ; dashdotdot-dash . He was on the high roof of a house near Hassolel Street at the time , overlooking an alleyway known as Assis Lane , which he had reached by means of a stairway and a precarious iron ladder that led to a catwalk for water tanks . He had chosen a high house deliberately , the better to trip the spies . Cunningly he stood there signaling , on , off , on , off , his eyes like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands shaking slightly from the chill of the late , high-mooned hour , of the city beneath its dark pall . " Blimey , " said Lieutenant Stark , who was on his way to the broadcasting station in a jeep , " ' oo 's that h'up there ? " " Bless my soul , " said the driver . " If it ai n't a bloody spy ! " They jumped from the jeep and dashed up the stairs as one man . Miracolo Orientale was apprehended and marched off in handcuffs to jail . His neighbor Victoria appeared at the Amirs ' house the next morning with her usual wrap and cigarette to request Elias 's help . " That pustema , " she said . " An old bachelor like him must have gone to peep at the lovers , poor man , and got himself caught . Claro . If he 's a spy , I 'm Elizabeth Marcus . " Elias first went to sound out the underground organizations . None of them , it turned out , had the slightest interest in aiding Nissim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know him , the Irgun snickered at his name , even the ultraorthodox Neturei Karta refused to acknowledge him as their own . At the burial society they panicked and anxiously asked Elias if their driver was in trouble with the law . " If he really were a criminal , or a member of the underground , " Elias told Sara , " it would be much easier , you 'd simply have to press the right buttons and the machinery would start . But a wacky case like this , Sara it does n't pay to be an unknown nut in Jerusalem these days . To say nothing of a nut who happens to be perfectly sane . Even the psychiatrist wants nothing to do with him . "  | Elias talked and talked , arguing and cajoling with his long , thin smile , until the British were convinced that Miracolo Orientale was no danger to the war effort . That same morning Lieutenant Starkie entered Miracolo 's cell , and spat from under his mustache : " You there ! " " Yes , officer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , officer , I swear to God I 'm ... " " You 're an idiot ! " He threw him out of the cell . " You disgusting Peeping Tom , " he said to him in the corridor , " if it was h'up to me I 'd give you ten years I would . Go on , get h'out of ' ere , you dirty old scum , let 's not see yer fice around ' ere again . " Miracolo went skinnily home and suddenly felt how sleepy he was . He slept for thirty hours and rose purged of spies , rooftops , and the kingdom of the night . Elias and Sara went to see how the redeemed man was doing and brought him some arak as a present . He had finished his long , resuscitating sleep and looked his old self again . He dusted off a seat for them , removing his night robes that still lay there stinking from an acacia branch , come in , come in , welcome , what guests , what an honor . He ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeds . " When I was a young boy , " he related , " there was a bruja in the neighborhood , you should pardon me telling you , who read my fortune in coffee grounds and told me to watch out for the night demon Lilith . She even made me an amulet against her . And just look how I forgot . Lilith , you should know , can disguise herself as she likes . Even as a German spy signaling in the night , she can , if that 's what she wants to be . Anything . " Little Ya'akov Cordoso finally got even with his grandfather . He came across a group of Australians who were looking for Sa'ada 's place . " You want girls ? " " We sure do . You know where it is ? "  | " You come with me . " He led them down the lane to his grandfather 's Talmud Torah and stopped them at the gate . " You each one pay me shilling . " They threw shillings , pounds , whatever they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to them . " Now you go up . Three floors , on the right , behind iron door . " The Australians went upstairs . There was a tremendous commotion . Benches toppled to the ground . Then down they came again on the run with Elder Cordoso pursuing them in full fury , waving his stick at their heads . After him whooped the Talmud Torah boys , peppering with their rolled-up notebooks the running soldiers , who defended themselves with mock blows . " Where 's the little chap who took our money ? " " Ya ' - a- kov ! We know it was you . You better come home quick , Grandpa 's going to give you a hi-i-ding ! " Then why come home at all ? Ya'akov logically asked himself . He carefully counted his shillings and put them away in a hiding place . " Grandpa 'll murder you black-'n ' - blue ! " " Abba , are n't you joining up too ? " asked Hillel one evening . Many fathers were already gone . Sara tensed for his answer . Elias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hillel . " " Why not ? " Noam asked . " If some men did n't stay behind to perform vital jobs , the whole country would fall apart . If I went , and a few more men like me , the courts would n't be able to function . " " And then the criminals could do what they wanted ? " asked Noam . " Well , it would make things easier for them , that 's for sure . " " That 's for sure , " Nadav agreed from his highchair . " There 'd be so many of them , even , there 'd be no room for them in jail , even . " Sara , who was in the middle of serving dinner , stopped for a minute to sort herself out , and found a combination of disappointment and relief .  | With your hand come and wave me good-bye , Cheerio , here Igo on my way .. . In a kibbutz cabin , far away from home , Sits a young Palmach boy , guarding all alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sara , attuned to the vibrating city , went hack to work . Not to the hospital : the thought of that great dungeon of suffering oppressed her . She looked for , and found , a job as a field worker , visiting needy homes on welfare all over the city . The work came to several hours a day . She was usually paired with another nurse , a Christian Arab named Therese . Neither of them had known before what depths of misery there were in the city , what poverty holed up in burrows , buried in mildew , stirring amid the huge stones covered with slobber and moss . An age-old underworld of poverty . Holes in the walls . Stinking puddles on the ground . Therese had been raised by French nuns . She still talks in a whisper , keeps her eyes on the ground , and walks with her legs close together . She writes in a tiny , calligraphic hand and can do the delicate embroidery of the convent , whose handiwork is famous throughout the world . In her gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its wings tucked in . At the height of the day , when the afternoon sun beats down on the dusty exhalations of the alleyways , her eyes see sudden glimmerings in the open gutters that pass for sidewalks , mysterious pinpoints of light , as though the puddles were gilt-bottomed ; in the rock-strewn , debris-covered urinals through which she passes , there are portents of the many numinous powers at work beneath her feet , in correspondence with the visible world . Since she and no one else sees them , she keeps it to herself . There is a mystery about her and a light . Her eyes never quite focus and she is infinitely kind . An old nun stood in the doorway of the convent school each morning with a tape measure in her hand to check on the prescribed length of  | the girls ' hemlines and sleeves . Penmanship was the main subject : if you could n't learn to write exactly like the nuns , your days in school were numbered . The priest , whose soft , buttery hands smelled of perfume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their confessions . And yet what horrible sins they had sinned : the sin of envying a friend whose collar was starched crisper , whose hair was prettier , than one 's own ; the sin of gossip ; the sin of not listening to the paternoster on a fine spring day when the sky was crisscrossed with swallows . The soft hands , the enveloping clouds of incense , the all-forgiving , allabsorbing soft chaos of it all , wiped the girls clean of the broad avenues of their childhoods , of the histories , traits , legacies , legends , of their families and homes . In what was left of them after this thorough French erasure , a new , prosthetic consciousness of nos ancetres les Gaulois was instilled . No more olive , vine , and fig . Henceforth , they were implanted mind-and-soul with great spruce and fir trees such as they had never seen in their lives , though everyone in the convent knew that these had cast their shade on young Jesus of Nazareth ; with unknown cherry groves ; with winter tales as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; with thatched roofs ; with broad rivers frozen over with ice on which simple midnight angels skimmed while a barb-tailed , cloven-footed devil hopped and jigged . The girls took to all this as to a strange , all-effacing dream . Be good , honor your superiors , speak properly , keep your ankles togetherand one festive day a taste of the promised paradise will be yours : a glittering , gold-laden procession of crosses through the narrow streets , artificial flowers of lucent , frozen wax , the ruby-red stones on the bishop 's robe and mitre tipped by the last rays of the sun , the choirs of candle-bearing votaries washed free of sin , the sonorous tones of the organ that resounded right through you as they spread and spread all around . Expandi manus meas ad te , anima mea , sings Therese , before stopping with embarrassment . Sara urges her to continue . " Sing , Therese . It 's lovely . Much nicer than that heavy German music of Bimbi's. "  | Sicut terra sine aqua , tibi .. . Therese sings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind those simple , gray , massive , pre-Gothic castles from the days when men built without windows because who needed windows anyway , in a setting of scraggly flocks , thickets of wild berries , and filthy chickens scratching in the straw that covered the lowered bridge of a moat . In Therese 's singing one can clearly make out the quarter tones of the Orient . Perhaps the Crusaders had brought them back across the sea with them to France . Now the melodic circle has been closed : down it has curved , through the innocent , cruel , heartbreaking Middle Ages , to return to its source , here , at the foot of the Temple Mount . Sometimes Sara makes fun of nos ancetres les Gaulois . She tells Therese about Monsieur Gaston in the rain , but Therese just thinks it is lovely . One has to love , Sara , she says softly , one has to love , human beings are so pitiful , we ca n't prevent a single death , all we can do is stave it off a little . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , but he sees that staving off as a sign of human strength . " " Oh , no , " Therese recoils . " Human beings have no strength . We live like flowers , by the grace of God . " That Christmas she bashfully brings Sara 's children a present : a small tree made of colored celluloid , its trunk set at the center of two intersecting pieces of wood . She has decorated it herself with gold and silver stars cut from tinsel , shiny , bubblelike beads , absorbent-cotton snow , and a fat paper angel on top staring down from a star . Little Jesus and his cross have been tactfully left out . The city sings , it swings like a pendulum on the radio airwaves , it grows excited , it writes letters , it weeps , it waxes sentimental , it hates , it listens . Olive picking follows grape picking , orange picking follows olive picking . Jeeps drive down the street , topless in summer , covered in winter . Sara and Therese walk and walk like two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is n't a corner of the city to which they have n't dragged their weary feet . Serene , transparent , her mane of coppery red hair falling over her face , Nili plays Czerny etudes and Beethoven sonatas with power and finesse . One day she accompanies a young singer from the conservatory in the role of Leporello boasting to little Madamina of the exploits of his master Don Juan . So many and so many women in Italy , so many and so many young maidens in Germany , but in Spain .. . ah , in Spain .. . in Espagna .. . mile e tre , mule e tre ! " One thousand and three , " Bimbi sings quietly along in his own room , careful not to disturb what he considers a sublime message from eternity itself .

Angels , thinks Dr. Bimbi , plain angels , the seriousness , the harmony , the way Nili stops just then and corrects her partner : " There 's no need for a ritardando here , you 've already got all the emphasis that you need in that phrase . Do n't overdo it . " And elegantly , exactly , she plays the coda on her piano . Mille e tre . Madame Savvidopoulos took the last of her ugly unmarried daughters and set off with her to Bahrain .  | ONE FRIDAY AFTERNOON , when Elias was about to go for a walk with the boys , four Arab peasants knocked on the door .

Their faces were sullen , and a demanding insistency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shut their fists as they talked , huddling together in the doorway as though their physical closeness gave them strength . Elias invited them inside . They were , it turned out , the nephews of the Arab who had rented the house on Melissanda Street to him and Sara over twelve years before . The four men 's uncle had included them in his will , and now they had come to reclaim their property , on which , they said , the Amarillos ' lease had run out . " It 's only right , ya hawajjah , " they repeated over and over , with a persistence that was half-entreaty , half-threat . " It 's only right . " Elias took out some documents to show them . Several years ago the accumulated rent money had already reached the purchase price of the house , the title to which had then been legally transferred to him .  | Their own father , the deceased man 's brother , had signed the papers himself . " Do n't you recognize your own father 's signature ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but someone has misled you in this matter . " In other times they would perhaps have taken no for an answer and gone their way . But the Jews were buying land everywhere these days , and their general sense of injustice was too great for them to give in . Who 's talking about money , they growled , we want our property back . They lowered their eyes before Elias 's proofs , but the wave of defiance still crested within them . " The effendis have sold all our lands , ya-Ustaz , " cried one of them . " Where shall we go , to the desert ? " " It 's your right to take me to court . We 're not living in Turkish times anymore . You can be sure you 'll get a fair trial . " " What do we know about trials , " said the tallest of them , a broken jaw upsetting the symmetry of his face . " It 's our land , and that 's that . " " The court rules for the Jews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though shorter than , his brother . There was something violent about him . " They 've picked the meat off our bones . " A nervous , guttural , peasanty speech , a volley of words followed by silence , another burst and silence again . Hands used to the earth . They stole a glance at the fruit trees in the garden . Sara had planted them . Fine trees . They coveted them with their eyes . Elias talked slowly , quietly . He tried to explain . The fact was that he sympathized with them . He knew their situation . So much land had been sold out from under them , from under their feet , that they themselves did n't know anymore what was theirs and what was n't . As far back as 1929 , peasants from Sur-Baher had razed the kibbutz of Ramat-Rachel , whose land had been bought from them with good money . The law , no law , could justify thisyet he , Elias , understood how they felt . There was something about land . If you owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you owned five , you dreamed of planting on twenty . It was n't easy to look at the fruit on a neighbor 's tree that had still been yours the minute before it was sold . What were doc-  | uments or contracts next to peaches that you 'd eaten from the day you were old enough to remember ? Peaches as old as the world , your world , the world of your childhood . In the end they rose to leave as if convinced , or at least as if persuaded that they had no tenable case . They finished the coffee that Sara had served , thanked Al-Ustaz Amarillo , and departed with their faces in frowns . An ancient taxi with two more companions was waiting for them outside . They crowded into it and drove off . Both sides were left with the uncertain feeling that the matter was not over . " They 'll be back , Elias , " said Sara , worried . " Like as not . We may have to call in the authorities yet . " But before Elias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was on a Sabbath morning , while Sara was in the kitchen and the boys were off in the old neighborhood visiting Gracia , who since her panicky flight had begun to accept her true age . The men barged suddenly through the front gate without knocking . There were five of them this time , and they spoke in near shouts . It seemed their purpose to put on a show of force , or at least to make a scene . Elias was alarmed . " Sara , run out the back door to the neighbors . Quick . I 'll lock up . " Sara , frightened , did as she was told , sweeping aside the vegetables she was peeling and hurrying outside with the paring knife still in her hand . The moment she turned her head to look back around the corner of the house , though , she saw the five of them treading deliberately , maliciously , on the row of phlox she had just planted that morning . Something peasanty reared up in her too , washing in a blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think what she was doing , she ran out on the front steps of the house . " Get out of my garden , " she said in a voice choked with rage . They squinted and looked at her as though from a red cloud . It only now dawned on her that she was facing the five of them alone . She retreated , backing up the steps toward the house , before realizing that Elias must have locked the front door . She was in for it now . She clutched the little paring knife behind her back , squeezing the handle until it hurt . There was n't a soul in the street .  | They began to move toward her on the staircase as one man , slowly , staring at her as though mutually spellbound by the violence in the air . The first of them put a hand on the railing . Her mind blanked out . A whitish mist drifted momentarily before her and then vanished . She felt very cold now , as though she had gone outside on a snowy day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house , frantically trying to dial the police from his room upstairs . Her face curled with contempt . Before any of the five could tread on the steps themselves , two men appeared suddenly in the gateway . One of them , brawny , not young , seemed to drag one leg ; the other was a shaggy , overgrown adolescent . Quickly they approached the five peasants , taking advantage of the second in which the five looked back with surprise to station themselves by Sara on the steps . Her head reeling , she made out the older of the two , who was wearing a khaki shirt , the one who dragged his leg , as Matti Zakkai . The other looked to be about twenty and was tall and bearlike ; he wore a gray undershirt and a peaked cap on his head , from beneath which his hair shot out wildly in all directions . " What 's going on here ? " asked Matti quietly , in Arabic . The spell of incipient violence was snapped . They knew it and hung their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the oldest of them , the fifth , unfamiliar one , who was missing a tooth in his mouth . " They 've taken away our land , they 've taken our house , God punish the robbers for their iniquity . " " Shut up ! " said the tallest , dragging the man away . " Yallah , let 's get out of here . " " And do n't step on my flowers , " Sara wanted to add , but her voice faltered and could n't be heard . They left in a hurry . " Sara Amarillo ! " said Matti . " I 'll be damned . I 'd like you to meet a friend of mine , we call him Bear . From Zefaniah Street . " Sara reached out to shake hands but was still holding the paring knife . She felt utterly embarrassed . " What 's that in your hand ? A knife ? Are you serious ? " His warm eyes , a pile of walnuts in a wooden bowl , sparkled as he regarded her  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with what had happened and could n't keep her hands still . She put down the knife on a windowsill and shook Bear 's hand . He bowed to her , ironic . She must have seemed a bit crazy to him , a woman of her age . She pulled herself together . " Matti Zakkai , you could n't have picked a better time to come . " " You just whistle and the whole old neighborhood comes running . Who were those men ? " She explained . " Come on in , you 've earned yourselves a cup of coffee . " " We ca n't , " said Matti . " We 're in the middle of work . We just happened to be taking a break . We 'll take you up on the coffee some other time . " He stood there for a minute looking at her . Only now did she notice the long , ugly scar that ran down his neck from his ear and disappeared into his coarse khaki shirt . Who stitched you up so terribly , she angrily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had the sweatsmell of a laborer . And something else that smelled like grease . His skin was white , as though it had n't seen much of the sun . " What are you doing these days , Sari ? " " A bit of nursing , on and off . " She smiled at him . Sari , he 'd called her . It was suddenly easy . Too easy . Like twenty years ago , or more , she wanted only to submerge herself in those half-sunlit , half-shaded eyes . Her twin in anxiety , in resolution . " And you ? " " A bit of lathe work , on and off . " He grinned . " If you ever have a free moment , ask for me at Cohen 's lathe shop over on Yosef benMatityahu Street . They 'll call me . " He took her hand . " And next time do n't take on five Arabs with a paring knife , because I do n't often happen to come by this way . " He pressed her hand to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I doubt that they 'll be back today . " " If they try , the police are bound to get here sometime too . " " Either they 'll get here or they wo n't , " drawled Bear . " My husband works in the Attorney General 's office . " " In that case , maybe they will . " They waved good-bye . Sara followed them to the gate and locked it carefully . She took shears and some string from the toolshed and went to work on the damaged plants , pruning the broken shoots , splinting  | what was left of them , firming up the ground around them . She needed time , lots of it , before she 'd want to see Elias again . Elias was angrier than she had ever seen him before . " You took a terrible risk , Sara , and a totally unnecessary one . It was quite irresponsible of you . I really do n't understand how you could have done such a thing , a mother of three children . " " Why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , dry-mouthed . " Because it would have been perfectly stupid of me to come out on the stairs . The best way to handle it was to keep them out of the house until the police came . " " Did n't you see that I was outside too ? " " It never occurred to me . What kind of a fool do you take me for ? Do you think I 'd have stayed in the house if I knew you were out there ? " He did n't speak to her the rest of the day , and she felt it was just as well . She herself could n't decide if he was right or wrong . She could only feel the locked door of her house against her back . As though trying to prove a point to her , and to himself , Elias set out that same evening for the agitated village near Sur-Baher . He did n't go by himself ; a police officer came too , and Hajj Kamal ad-Din , Subhi Bey 's brother , who made it his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences between Arabs and Jews . They conferred till late at night in the village headman 's house and then drove hack in the police car . It was after midnight when Elias came home . The rooms were dark and he did n't turn on any lights . He washed and undressed by the light of the street lamps , which filtered through the branches of a large fern that Sara had placed in the windowa leafy light whose long shadows made a dark plant on the floor where none stood . Sara held her breath . " Sara ? " he whispered . " Are you asleep ? " " No . Was anything settled ? " " Of course it was . The headman gave us his word , and so did their oldest son , and the head of the family , and all the uncles . They them-  | selves admitted that they got carried away and lost their heads . And that 's the correct way to do things . " He lay down beside her , angry . " Are the boys home ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " " Did you tell her what happened ? " " I told her there was almost a fight . She said that she would n't have gone to the village if she were you . That she does n't trust them . " Elias sighed . " I 'm telling you , there were n't any problems . You 're unreasonable , Sara . You get yourself into trouble and want others to get you out again . How primitive can you be ? " he asked plaintively , summing up . She did n't answer him . The man has so many words , she thought , and he 's never seen a real corpse in his life . They lay next to each other very straight , without touching . It took them a long time to fall asleep . A few days later , while making her nurse 's rounds , Sara , dressed in her white uniform , stepped into Cohen 's lathe shop on Ben-Matityahu Street . Three men were at work inside , one of whom was Bear . The two others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaked caps too , their lean muscles sticking out on their thin arms like the white vesicles of a pupa . All were pale-skinned as gray and prosaiclooking , it seemed to her , as could be . There was a smell of oil and metal filings in the air . " Good morning , Sister Sara , " drawled Bear in his slightly swaggering voice . " How are you ? Are those men still bothering you ? " " No , we 've seen the last of them for a while . My husband is taking care of them , " she added , confused by her own need to be loyal . " Where 's Matti ? " There was a moment 's silence . " He 's out , " said one of the other two workers . Sara did n't believe him . She did n't know why , but she did n't . And yet she sensed no hostility on their part . It was simply as if they were waiting for some code word she did n't know . Each waited for the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she persisted . They exchanged glances .  | " Maybe . In a quarter of an hour . Go take a little walk and we 'll get him . " " Listen , you two , " said Bear , " let 's not play games . If this whole thing blows sky-high on us tomorrow , who 'll take care of us if not Sister Sara ? ... Come on , I 'll take you to Matti . " One of the workers shrugged : " It 's your lookout . I do n't know from nothing . " They turned pointedly back to their work . She followed Bear . He opened a side door leading into a backyard that was filled with rusting junk and surrounded by a crooked stone wall layered with concrete . The yard was neglected , full of dry brown brambles , and smelled like an outhouse . " I take it this is your restroom , " said Sara . Bear grinned . " We like it to stink , that way no one comes poking around . If you feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be glad to look the other way . Excuse how I talk , I 'm that way with everyone . It 's my character . " He approached a manhole hidden beneath a sheet of rusty tin and pulled aside its cover , whose handle was smudged with whitewash and dirt . " Step right this way , modom . " She fought back a moment 's nausea , repelled by the foul stench , and started down the ladder . Soon her feet made contact with solid , level ground , while above her she made out more openings for light and air . These were covered with piles of dry brambles , which , from the darkness of the tunnel , glittered against the sky like gold set in indigo . Unlike the filthy yard , the tunnel was an orderly place whose proprietors seemed to know exactly what they were up to . She stepped easily down to the ground with Bear right behind her and heard him close the manhole cover from within , wondering for a second how it was done . After walking some twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rust , beyond which several steps led to an underground chamber lit by naked bulbs . By a large worktable that took up  | most of the space stood Matti , whitely naked from the waist up , peering at something through a face mask that he wore . He was busy welding with a small torch . For a minute she stood there , taking in the sight of his back as he worked . There was n't a wasted or nervous movement to him ; it was as if he were tuned to some very regular and precise inner rhythm of his own . Not until he switched off the torch and removed his mask did he sense them behind him and spin around . " You , " he said quickly , letting his blackened hands drop . His eyes sparked . " Matti , " said Bear , " you might at least wash your hands . Ca n't you see she 's wearing a white dress ? " " Mind your manners with Sister Sara , " said Matti mildly without taking his eyes off her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , " said Bear . " You 're responsible for the return convoy , Matti . " He waved good-bye and retraced his steps . " You , " said Matti again , pleased . They stood a long time , welded in wonderment and desire , shooting sparks . " So here 's where you live . " " Here . You can sit on that crate . There are some old Mills hand grenades in it that I 've been fixing up to make less nervous . " " It wo n't make them more nervous if I sit down on them ? " " No , they do n't get upset when they 're not primed . " She sat down . " Sometimes this place is full of dinosaurs and elephants , " said Matti . " We make all kinds of things out of junk . It 's pretty empty here today , just little odds and ends . " " And this all comes from your training at the Alliance school ? " " At the Alliance , with a few later installments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " " And you work here all the time ? " " We take shifts . Bear 's a terrific worker . You must n't mind his big mouth , he has fine hands . " " Just a minute , Maui . If that 's how it is , you never get any sunlight at all . Do you drink milk ? " " The fact is that there 's a standing order to bring us milk , all of us  | galley slaves , but with Jerusalem in the state it is , it does n't often get done . About one time in five . You wo n't believe how disorganized everything is here . Out in the countryside it 's easier , they keep a special cow for you . Straight from the barn to the bunker . " " Matti , you 'll get sick . I 'll bring you people milk myself . " " That would be most gracious of you . " They said nothing for a while . " Did those men ever come back ? " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't bring herself to mention Elias this time . " Sari ? " He lowered his voice . " How are you ? " " All right . I guess . " " I 'm dying to hug you , but my hands are black . " She rose and went over to him , passing two cautious fingers over his face , along his gross scar . They looked deeply at each other , silent , unarmed . " It 's been at least twenty years , " she said under her breath . " They never passed . " " True . They never did . " He stood facing her tensely , careful to keep his hands to himself , transmitting without words . " Matti , I have to go now . People are waiting for me . I 'll be back during the week , with that milk . That does n't mean that I 'll always be able to come down here . " " Do n't worry about it , " he said . " I 'm not always down here either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift to me . I 've hit the jackpot . " " Come , walk me back up to the yard . " He followed her , regarding her from behind as she climbed the ladder , as tall almost as he was , a woman with cradling fundaments of thighs , strong legs , bristling , electric hair , and a laugh . The way she had come back to him . Had fallen right into his life . Bear had left the manhole open against regulations , covering it only with the rusty tin sheet , but Matti decided to let it pass . This time . This day that his eyes had made him a happy man . " Bear did n't ask you to contribute to our security zone ? " he asked , rubbing his eyes in the sunlight .  | " Of course he did . " The strong light called for a different language , one they did n't yet share . " I 'll see you soon , Matti . " " See you soon , Sari . Watch your step by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lathe shop and walked slowly through Me'a She'arim and down Saint George Street , Matti dragging his foot a bit , and how comely is thy hair in the light , 0 my beloved . " So when exactly did you lose your foot , Matti ? " " Just half of it . It was during the Switzerland course . You never heard of it ? There was this small-arms course that everyone in it told their family they were going to Switzerland , because it was a bit long . I had a disagreement with my platoon commander about the reliability of a certain grenade . He was wrong and I was right . You need n't look at me that way , a commander 's entitled to make a few mistakes . So this year I 'm filling in here in Jerusalem , they needed an armorer , but it 's only temporary . It 's a bit of a rough time for me , actually . We 're hard-pressed at home , it 's not easy for my wife there . And my smallest boy has asthma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we live in . I 've already been promised that a kibbutz will take them in , and that I 'll be able to go back to full-time work with the Haganah . You and I just happened to meet again in a little crack in history , Sari . All my friends are off on operations or in some course . And here I am , with a bum leg in Jerusalem , greasing a few pitiful gunsyou would n't believe how pitiful . But for a reward , you silly hero , I got to see you playing soldier yourself with your paring knife . You looked just like your Aunt Victoria then . By the way , do you remember old Hankes , whom you all hated so much after that business with Shabu ? He was really one of the few decent people around then . Two little guns were brought to Jerusalem then , just imagine , two little guns that were the pride of the whole Haganah , and Hankes let us keep them in a barrel in his wine store . They were right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pester me in the cellar . Do n't hit me now , I 'm not complaining , not about that cellar or about anything else . I 'm just mentioning it for the record . " " Right under Tony Crowther 's nose . "  | " Under Tony Crowther 's nose , and under Hayyim Cordoso 's nose , who was working for the police . " " We guessed as much , only not until much later . " " Sari , what happened to Elder Amarillo ? Is he still alive ? " " He died thirteen years ago . " He threw a quick glance at her , fathoming an entire dimension . " And Ofra , what happened to her ? " She told him . " We have n't heard a word from her since the fall of France . And they 're shipping Jews off to the camps from there now . " " Maybe the von ' will stand her in good stead , because I doubt that the conversion will help much . " " That 's what we all say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is too good to be true . It 's a luxury . And I do n't believe in luxuries . " " You call this a luxury ? " " Do I have to explain myself ? " " No . " They stood immobile . Without touching , he let her have all of him , planted himself in her body , which had opened to him wholly , between her unlifted arms . Lead me among the clefts of thy voice , that we fall not among heartbeats , 0 my chief joy . All villages are more villages at night , all the neighborhoods more themselves . Each place burrows down , lit from within , noisy with suppertime , as though the out-of-doors had been expropriated from human beings by a dark , odorous ocean in which every house is now an island , an impregnable asylum for the night . Between the villages , between the neighborhoods , the distances grow vast ; one does not just step outside anymore , one takes a flashlight , one casts rings of weak light on the low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the terraced earth , on a path hurriedly crossed , as though on a thousand legs , by some little night beast . The quick , cautious , snuffing nose of a jackal or fox between Theodosius and the tombstones on the Mount of  | Olives . The hopping flight of a barn owl above the rooftops of Ezrat Yisra'el . Hoot owls keening over the valley beneath French Wood , that forms a melancholy triangle with the tomb of Sheikh Jarrah and the tomb of Shimon the Just . Every creature has its own sounds , every bird its own call , to warn away others from a territory whose borders it alone knows , an unmarked estate the slightest trespass on which leads to a flurry of bared fangs , beating wings , crooked claws , to treetop scuffles in the dead of night , the quick pounce , the final gasp , angry bluster and threat . Neither Sara nor Therese likes to go far at night , but with some households , where the man comes home from his work after dark , they have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets again , tall in their habits , temporary friends . Of their fears they never speak . The naked bulb cast its light in the bunker . Matti and Sara sat on a blanket that had been spread upon a crate . " I 'd like to go down to the coast . There 's talk of illegal immigration again , it 's the most important thing now , and I 've all but been promised a part in it . Meanwhile Hadassa had to take the little boy to Gedera for three weeks , he just ca n't shake that asthma of his here . For a whole lot of reasons , we have to get out of Jerusalem . " " Her name is Hadassa . " " It 's Hadassa , but she really was named Esther . She hated it and changed it to Hadassa . " Esther-Hadassa began to be real . There once was a girl who felt ashamed of her name . She had her loves and her hates , and she had borne Matti four children . Hadassa Zakkai of Shimon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that mercilessly showed her herself . Sara felt utterly crushed . " What 's his name ? " Matti asked roughly . " Elias Amarillo . Now Amir . " " A relative of yours ? " " A distant one . " The word " distant " took on its other meaning . They felt unsure of themselves .  | " You see , Sari , there 's so much we do n't know . I have the feeling of living in something that 's not mine . " " What 's not yours , Matti ? " she asked gently . " Myself ? " " I do n't know . Something 's twisted here . Or maybe I am . " " Look , Matti , let 's bring it down to earth . Come home with me , meet Elias and the boys . We 'll straighten things out . " " It would never work out . And that 's why I do n't want to meet Elias and your boys . Just the thought of it kills me . Why drive each other crazy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I call it home too . That makes two homes . " They fell silent . " It 's like I say , Sari . A crack in time . I 'll be gone before you know it . " She did n't answer . He only now noticed that she had a Band-Aid on her finger . It made him wince more than it should have . He still could n't stand the thought of her suffering pain . That old compassion . He took her hurt hand and pressed it to his mouth . " What happened to my Sari ? " " Nothing . I burned myself on the iron . " He kissed her fingers one by one . " Are you sure it 's all right ? " " What 's the matter with you , Matti ? Of course it is . If you make such a fuss over a little burn , what kind of crazy father must you be ? " " You 'd be surprised . I 'm not really even a good one . I leave it all to Hadassa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother hen . She does n't miss a trick . I 'm not so good at this fatherhood business , I have n't been home enough for it . Courses , other things . Sometimes it seems to me that they 're only on my lap when I want them to be , never when they do . " A hard , melodic face , and for so many years she used to draw the map of it after he 'd gone , always with the same empty , unexplored spaces . " What was that story you once started to tell me about your father ? " " Well , it 's like this . My parents were apparently never married . Or in any case , they never lived together . He was a typical Russian intel-  | lectual bore , something of a linguist and part anarchist too . And she was a working girl . On principle , so as not to have to work in some office during the day , he worked as a night watchman in a furniture warehousethough I never really did understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thieves ? His big thing was that he wanted everyone to write Hebrew in Latin characters . He even wrote me letters like that , in Latin characters . I could n't stand them . During the day he wrote linguistic pamphlets and did research that nobody gave a damn about . It makes me sick to this day to think of those piles of pamphlets written in his beautiful calligraphic hand , mountains and mountains of worthless paper covered with cobwebs . All that effort . And all in the same shrill , pompous tones . A man as gray as a sack , but he wrote in screaming red . After the age of ten I hardly ever saw him . I think he bummed around along the coast for a while . He was probably organizing a secret group of terrorist linguists , or something like that . " " In Latin code . " " In Latin code . My mother worked hard . For a while she even worked in the building trade , laying floor tiles . She was a union member . Now she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She never talked much , but it was she who brought me up , more or less . And when I was fifteen years old , he committed suicide . He hung himself here in Jerusalem , in the furniture warehouse where he once worked . I do n't know what it was supposed to symbolize . And believe me , I thought even less of the way he died than of the way he lived . He must have seen himself as the totally involved man , but he was really the total dropout . My mother was the involved one . Involved by him . A man of words . Well , that 's enough fairy tales for the day , Sari . Tell me , did you happen by any chance to be on Geula Street today ? I heard they slapped a curfew on some houses there , that they were looking for some Stern Gang people , is that true ? Bear did n't show up for work . " " I was there . Depressing . Barbed wire everywhere . Some people had n't done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loaves of bread over the wire . A police car kept driving up and  | down , trying to stop it . Armed soldiers . Whistles . Screaming children . Hysteria . " She could feel his body growing rigid next to her . " Matti , do n't make yourself completely into a tool of war , like Bear . " " Look , when there 's a war on , someone has to be its tool . " " But you do n't have to love it . " He looked at her reproachfully : an intentional , unevadable wrong . " Sure . I 'll keep it in mind . " Their mood was spoiled . " Sari , " he said pleadingly , " I have to stay sane . I have to . You should understand that better than anyone . " Sara rose to go . " Sure . I 'll keep it in mind . " She did n't return to the bunker , or bring him milk , again . Nadav rode across the garden on his tricycle and cut her off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curfew . " " I have a pass . " " Let 's see it . " She fumbled in her purse and showed him . He relented momentarily , then pushed the tricycle in front of her again . " So what if you do , even . " How could one leave them . One day Elias Amir came home with a book that a British colleague had brought him from India , a practical treatise on lovemaking in the best Hindu manner : what to say and how , which sounds to make when , the best time to scratch the left shoulder with the fingernails . " It 's all such nonsense , Eli . " " But you 've been bored lately in bed . At least it 's good for a laugh . " She dreamt that she was standing with the two of them under a wedding canopy . Matti , who was on her right , slipped the wedding ring onto her hand with a single , characteristically purposeful movement .  | Then she extended her left hand to Elias , who awkwardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matti looked at him with fond patience , like an adult couple at a laggard child , while he applied himself and succeeded . Applause broke out and Sara linked arms with both men . The three of them grandly descended from the proscenium , while the guests gaily cried , Look how simple it is , there 's really nothing to it . She awoke with a delicious sense of victory , as though she had just invented something of universal importance , so simple yet ingenious that no one had thought of it before . Coughing , catarrhal , indignant , suspicious , Sa'ada came to Elias 's office one day . She and some of her girls had been caught in the NAAFI , the British army store , with ration books that they had no right to have . " The soldiers gave them to us , " Sa'ada fumed . " How were we supposed to know ? " Elias thought for a moment . " Look here , Madame Sa'ada . As long as your relations with a soldier are purely commercial , there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even his adoptive family . " " So what do you want me to do , give them my girls for their lousy butter ? " " I would n't suggest that , but every now and then you might invite a few of them , just like that , for a free cup of tea or some cake , and then we could claimit 's worth a try , anywaythat your house is the residence abroad of the soldiers in question , which would entitle you to make use of their rations for the purpose of entertaining them . Do you get what I 'm saying ? If you charge for everything , you ca n't be like a family ; but if you entertain free of cost , we can tell the judge that you are . " She struggled at length with the thought , but in the end her instincts proved stronger . " No . I do n't give away anything for nothing . " " In that case , you 'll have to give up the ration books and not use them again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " I suggested a way out . If you do n't want to take it , you ca n't use the books . " She mumbled angrily as she got to her feet , knotted her heavy kerchief , and started for the door . When she reached it , she turned around : " How much ? " She drew from her bosom a sewn linen purse still warm from the giant breasts that had surrounded it like a fortress , wet her thumb , and grudgingly ticked off a few bills that had been in the pocket of a New Zealand soldier several hours before , and several hours before that , under lock and key in the chest of the regimental paymaster . The King 's shilling . Just like olden times , when each soldier signed for his shilling in an English town square to the accompaniment of a crier and a trumpeted fanfare , except that now it was a barking , whiskered paymaster dressed in desert khaki , whose bugle had been exchanged for a field telephone . " Do n't mention it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't doubt the point would be lost on her . " Actually , " Elias told Sara , " I 'm sorry that was her decision , I would have been very curious to see how such an argument would have sat with the courta cheap whorehouse as a soldier 's residence abroad . In loco parentis . Now we 'll never know . She ruined my chances to make legal history . " Though business was booming , Sa'ada decided that life in Jerusalem was becoming too difficult . Starkie kept pressing her for information in a way that Tony Crowther never had , and she really had none to give him . Starkie did n't believe her . Well , then , he would say , you 'd better get some , or I 'll ' ave you locked up , see ? Sometimes one of the " hello-George " boys below would come to tell her about some terrorist he had seen in the alley , but these reports were undependable ; the young men had vivid imaginations and enjoyed sending Sa'ada and the British off on wild-goose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in any case , by the time Starkie and his men would arrive , the neighborhood was always clean . Once they informed her that they had  | captured a dangerous saboteur armed with a pistol in his pocket and were holding him in custody . Starkie came on the double in a desertcolored jeep , pulled up with an arrogant screech of the brakes , and saw that they were hilariously holding little Miracolo Orientale and keeping him from entering his house . Miracolo was in the midst of throwing a despairing glance at Victoria 's balcony , from which he hoped his salvation might come . Victoria , Victoria , he wept inwardly , you 're up there and I 'm down here , and nothing but calamity in between . But Victoria was n't home , and her balcony was deserted except for the usual garlics and peppers that were drying there in the sun . At that exact moment Starkie arrived with his jeep . " A jeep , Lord , the righteous shall be saved from travail , " Miracolo whispered under his breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You there ! " growled Starkie menacingly . You Peeping Tom , you ! Get out of'ere , quick march ! " " Yes , officer . " " And you , you bunch of bloody h'idiots , break it up ! ' Op it ! " To be on the safe side , he swung his stick at a few of them . They ran , pretending to howl with pain . " Those hoodlums are taking over the neighborhood , " everybody said . " Something really has to be done . " " Never mind , " said Mr. Cordoso , " it 's just as well that they 're concentrated in one place . Imagine if those ne'er-do-wells were to scatter , the police would n't begin to know where to look for them . " A night or two later , Sa'ada made up her mind . She slit open her mattress , took out the wads of bills that were hidden there , and dug up by moonlight a large jar buried beneath the fig tree that was full of bills too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed and the Food Control Bureau opened an office in Sa'ada 's old house . Pregnant women requesting extra rations and toothless old men with medical papers sat on wooden benches beneath the shade of the fig tree and grumblingly fanned themselves with folded newspapers .  | Sara had had a bad day . She had gone with Therese to visit the family of an unregenerate alcoholic and had found a bruised , beaten woman and sick children , including a two-year-old girl with a burn on her cheek where her father had hit her with a frying pan . It was too much for both of them . Sara had repeatedly consulted Elias about the case , yet she knew there was little he could do . The police preferred to keep out of family quarrels , while the woman was too scared of her husband to file a complaint . She made supper and put the children to bed , but she could n't seem to calm down . Her head felt as though it were bursting . " Elias , I 'm going out for a walk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the folder of documents in which he was immersed . " I wo n't be gone long . An hour or so . Perhaps a bit longer . " It was a dark , moonless night , a sticky darkness that made your heart beat faster . At first she did n't know where she was going . Her feet took her downhill , down the steps that led to the tomb of Shimon the Just . It was pitch dark . She felt frightened . She switched off her flashlight so as not to be seen herself . High brambles suddenly grew all around ; the unkempt field , strewn with rubbish during the day , was now a whirlpool of night sounds and night shapes . She kept her eyes on the lights that flickered weakly from the huts across the way . She tripped , regained her footing , and then , in a single panicky moment , twisted her ankle and fell from the footbridge she was walking on into the shallow conduit below . When she managed to climb out again , her purse , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , was gone . Her forehead broke out in a sweat . She cried but walked on . Just a little farther , she kept telling herself , it is n't far now , just a little farther . A dog barked . The first fences of the neighborhood appeared . A jagged , rusty piece of tin caressed her foot . The shacks loomed large around her . She drew a beam with her flashlight on door after door , trying to see . Hadassa and Mattan Zakkai . Mattan ? She had always supposed it was Matityahu . A can of geraniums stood outside . On the  | freshly painted door a child had drawn something with chalk . A home . Pallid light shone out from within . She knocked . Matti opened the door . He stood wonderingly in the narrow doorway , blocking it with his body and with his hands that rested on the jambs . A dusky kerosene lamp silhouetted him from behind . He was wearing an undershirt . Something quiet and unassuming about him . In his fingers he held a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , grimy-handed as usual and without notable success , his daughter 's dress . The threadbarest of rooms could be made out over his shoul-ders . " You ! " " Matti , I lost my papers , my shoes are soaking wet , and I have n't an ounce of strength left . " " Take them off , Sari . " He put the kettle up . He said nothing . He ran a loving finger over her face , down the inside of her arm , over her eyes that were shut with accumulated fatigue , perhaps of all the years since Zaki had run off . Be it the death of him , he knew he could do her no harm . The children were asleep ; the smell of their breathing filled the room , the milky , animal vapors of three washed little bodies . One of them whimpered , snorted like a steam engine , and turned over in his sleep . He came in her as though into his own among all the families of earth .  | MATTI WAS FULL of undistilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerusalem , the boy had another asthma attack . The whole trip had been in vain . Matti went feverishly out into the night to look for a doctor , took a wrong turn in the driving rain , missed two more , and lost several valuable minutes . Had anyone stopped him to ask where he was going , he would n't have known just then . The rain flooded down his face . He did n't bother to wipe it . It ca n't go on like this anymore , he told himself . He was full with Sara as though he 'd exchanged his bodily heat for her own , implanted in her , in her and this city , which was one big bunker now , an impenetrable warren , his own warm , private hole , the cave of Matti the Just . So close to the lull of your breath I can touch it , all the time , even at home , I pronounce you a secret line cut into the flesh of my hand that I clench harder and harder . I ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , but I ca n't even see her . How can you fence yourself in with thin air ?  | When the doctor had left and her son felt better , Hadassa wept quietly . Matti listened with total abnegation to her choked , broken cries , on his way with a towel and a bowl of warm water to bathe the boy 's sweaty body . I 'm not a child , he kept telling himself , I 'm fortytwo years old already . When she finally fell asleep , he buried his face in his hands and sat without moving . Inside the shack the low flame of the lamp trembled above the sleeping heads of the children . A letter from Amatsia arrived from the Egyptian desert , stamped with the censor 's approval . Hulda sniffed the paper it was written on . It smelled of army . Dear Hulda and Bimbi , This desert is dull , pointless , inchoate , full of heavy khaki objects that bounce from place to place and light khaki objects that you carry on youand it is absolutely crucial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a map that keeps tearing loose in the dry wind , one can see no connection between what one is doing and this war against the Great Fiend , there 's still something that so obviously unites the snows in Russia , thousands of kilometers from here , with the sand that I eat with my bully beef . It 's hard work , but it 's meaningful . And it 's all so clear . Do you remember , Bimbi , how you once told me that you longed for a language that had no green lawns between its words ? Here there are n't even sidewalks between the words , not even a winding Jerusalem path . Our talk here is monstrously laconic , the code of a practical tribe of men caught up in that most stirring , boring , dreadful , and marvelous of things , a just war . Sometimes I think that this is perhaps the last just war that will ever be fought . I do n't know how well defined the forces of Good are in itthey 're too dispersed and sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmistakable . As for myself , personally , I 've chucked here a lot of what was superfluous , perhaps even ostentatious , and it may be that on my return to Jerusalem ( when ? ) I 'll no longer be as broad-minded , as worldly as you who are my family . I 've become frightfully  | unenlightened . You 'd be shocked to see how crude my humor has become , how simple my needs . What 's mine is mine , I 'll bash whoever does n't like it in the teeth , and that 's that . Terribly simplistic , Hulda , is n't it ? And by the way , I think that our friends Taleb and Husni and that whole gang of theirs , because they 're doing nothing against Hitler , and even a few things for him , are losing out on the significance of this century . I think a lot about Nili , and the cedar tree , and the two of you in our city that I hardly dare allow myself the luxury of longing for . Swimming in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruined by too much tea and tinned meat , moronized by meteorology , tired tired tired , I ask that you make me when I come home , if I come home , a big bowl of salad with fresh mint and green olive oil , and a cup of real coffee . No concerts , no books , no art exhibitions , please . My friends , there are men here who have n't seen their wives and their children for nearly five years . Who am I compared to them ? Nahum is working hard at the military hospital in Alexandria . I received a brief note from him last week through an officer friend . He says that he thinks he 's got a big surprise for us all , but he does n't say what . Best regards to los Amarillos . Limitless love and kisses to you all . The censor had lingered over such words as " sidewalks " and " code " but had n't crossed anything out . He was a well-known author who had been made a censor in the desert because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His transfer papers in his pocket , Matti drives up to the lathe shop in someone 's commercial van and finds Sara delivering milk . " Get in . " " Have we struck it rich ? " " That 's just what we 've done . Let 's have a ball . " The car is already moving when he says : " Sari , I hope you do n't have any plans for the next hour and a half , because I 'm kidnapping you out of town . "  | " That 's a disaster , " says Sara , delighted . " I still have three homes on my list . " " Can they wait ? " " If they could n't , I would n't be here , Matti . I 'll manage . Therese will help out . " He locks the door on her side so that she wo n't fall out . " Are you cold ? " " No . " The village of Ein-Karem disappears with its valley , the last of the fogbound , castlelike , grace-given city , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where to , Matti ? " " To paradise . " And he adds : " You Jerusalemites have forgotten what it means just to go for a ride . " " With good reason . " " Uh-uh , " he overrules her . " One must n't be penned up , no matter what . You should know that if anyone does . " He stops the car in a wash of fog . On one side is a stone wall , on the other an embankment . At least let this last time be a good one . " Come , Sari . " " Is there a path here ? " " A porcupine trail . " A long hard climb . Matti leads the way up the slope , limping a little , reaching back his hand to her at the hard parts . An occasional arbutus tree flashes red on the hillside . Trampled porcupine quills , already well muddied . Sara gasps for breath . Tiny flakes of snow are mixed among the wettish drops that fall in a ceaseless gray mass . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Once in a squad-leader course we saw two deer cross the trail right here . Thirty meters in front of us . They disappeared over there , in that thicket . " " Were n't they cold ? " " Soon we wo n't be either , " he promises , hugging her . This is our home . He could feel as never before his two arms and hers . This is  | our home , our four walls . He does n't begin to have the strength to tell her it is finished . Sara spreads her nurse 's robe beneath a large , wet carob tree . The rock is covered with moss and rotted leaves . The cliff drops off ahead in one plunge against a background of dreaming hills that glitter silver-wet with large stones . Veiled peaks , the dark growth of winter , more black than green . A grayish fog . " What a ball , " Sara says . " Was n't it worth the climb ? " he asks gently . He searches for a crack in the monolith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is too of one piece , too bewitched to let reality in . She 'll never listen to me now , it 's hopeless , he tells himself , despairing and joyous at once , delinquent , a coward , but happy , swept along . " Do n't yet , " she whispers . " Can you still ? " " Forever . " " You 're mine . " He looks into her eyes . " Do n't ever forget it . Mine . " He keeps finding new levels in them , of years , paths , light , all his . " Mine . " Something large and invisible , perhaps a blackbird , calls musically from the tangled branches of a nearby oak . It seems to Sara that she had never seen such white mountain light before , as of water before its fall , as of branches , birds , snow . Risen on one elbow , brushing something from her brow , flesh of her flesh . They drive home in silence . A gust of rain meets them at the entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is wet and smells of pine needles , and of something else too that suggests hoary lichen in chinked rock . Matti feels a total failure for not being able to tell her and withdraws inside himself , not looking at her . Sara lays a hand on his arm , but he stiffens and does not respond . Guess , Sara , he begs inwardly , guess , my clear-eyed one , so that I do n't have to tell you . But Sara is adream , spindrift , and spellbound ; his new mood still says nothing to her . She has lost all sense of time and can feel him still inside  | her . Him and the white light . The rain mixed with sleet beats fiercely against the tin body of the car . " Drop me off here , Matti , " she says . He nods and brakes . " Next week ? " He mumbles something and slams the door shut . He does n't like himself just then . Neither does he like the face that smiles at him through the wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and robe . He can not for the life of him imagine what there is to smile about . What a lousy deal it all is . " Mother , do you hear me ? " Hillel burst flushed with excitement into the house . " They found an arms cache in our school last night ! What do you say about that ? It was there all the time and nobody knew ! " " I should think that somebody must have known . " " The highest grades knew . One of the boys was standing lookout , and the others were training inside , and suddenly a C.I.D . car drove up , and one of the ceedies jumped out , and before he could press the button the ceedy said to him in Hebrew , No , boy , do n't you do it , ' but he pressed it anyway , and they got away through the field , but the ceedies found a crate with five grenades in it , right in our school , Mother ! And now they want to shut it down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal 's at the police station , but everyone says he 'll get out quick because he really does n't know anything , he 's such a jerk that he was n't even in on it . No one trusts him . " " It 's too bad about the grenades , " said Sara . " What kind were they , Mills ? " " What do you know about grenades ? " " What does it sound like I know ? " He was crestfallen : " Mills . " He went off to play in his room but a few minutes later reappeared in the kitchen . " You know what I think , they should never have left those grenades there . You can bet I 'd never have left them . " " What would you have done with them ? "  | " You can bet I 'd have done something . I can think of all kinds of things . " " What , for example ? " " I just told you , all kinds of things . Maybe I 'll talk it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think . " He left , then stuck his head back through the door : " There 's going to be a student demonstration tomorrow . " On the corner of Prophets Street military policemen are busy unloading a truck full of thin , swarthy Italian prisoners of war . A deafening chorus of wolf whistles descends on her . Their war is over . They sniff their new surroundings , a hungry swarm of men , cordoned off from the street by the wall of MPs . " Bear , where 's Matti ? " " He 's gone . But consider me at your service . " " Bear , please do n't clown around . Where 's Matti ? Is he down below ? " " I just told you , but you would n't believe me . He 's gone . Vanished . Taken a powder . " " His transfer came through ? " " To his great pleasure . " He watches as he presses the tack into her , cruelly . Then he feels sorry . " As far as I know , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , think hard , he did n't leave me any message ? " " I do n't think so . " " Try to think , it 's important . " " Well , Matti said this : If Sara comes tell her that . . . no , do n't tell her anything . ' So do you call that leaving you a message or not leaving you a message ? Sit down for a minute . " He graciously offers her a chair . " No , thanks . " " I take it that now that Matti 's gone , the fighting proletariat wo n't be getting its milk anymore , " says Bear . It is impossible to tell if he is teasing her again or being serious . " You 'll get your milk , " says Sara as she leaves
