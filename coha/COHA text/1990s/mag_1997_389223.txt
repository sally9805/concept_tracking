Philip Morris CEO Geoffrey Bible has long sneered at tobacco 's foes . When the news broke that he was negotiating a settlement with those same foes , most people were stunned . // WHEN GEOFFREY BIBLE BECAME chief executive of Philip Morris , he was , in the words of one Wall Street follower , " the Crocodile Dundee of the tobacco industry . " A hyperactive , wiry Australian who had spent a career swashbuckling in treacherous overseas markets , Bible bounded into the CEO job three years ago in typically brash fashion . " We are not going to be anybody 's punching bag , " he promised investors . A crusader who thrived on combat , Bible favored Churchillian language in describing tobacco 's enemies and even likened Philip Morris ' battles against the anti-tobacco forces to World War II . " We shall fight , fight , fight , " he pledged , because " when you are right and you fight , you win . " Now , with the unprecedented settlement between Big Tobacco and the states ' attorneys general last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing he vowed never to do : capitulate . It 's caused some people to wonder whether the world 's most powerful tobacco boss-a man who really stands as the last chest-thumping tobacco chieftain-has lost his legendary fire . Since Philip Morris sells almost half the cigarettes that Americans smoke each year , it 's due to pay the most in the tobacco industry 's landmark $368.5 billion settlement-about half that stunning amount , to be spread over 25 years . If the deal gets through Congress-a huge if-Philip Morris also must comply with all sorts of onerous new restrictions on marketing . So long , Marlboro Man . Why did Bible settle ? He 's not telling anyone the reason-neither FORTUNE , nor Wall Street analysts , nor anyone else who could possibly affect the fate of what is shaping up to be the most controversial peace agreement in American business history . In fact , the tobacco executives agreed among themselves not to speak publicly about the deal . Obviously , they are fearful that boasting-which has long been a Bible specialty-might signal that the settlement favors the tobacco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting-primarily litigation relief , as well as strictures on the FDA 's ability to regulate nicotine-is potentially dangerous for the companies . After all , it 's becoming increasingly plain that the newly empowered antitobacco forces do n't want the tobacco companies to get anything out of the deal . Clearly , Bible did not go gently into this settlement . People who know him say that he was dragged reluctantly into the talks and was consistently skeptical they would reach a successful conclusion . Even now , with the deed done , he is said to harbor major concerns about the outcome . But the threats to Philip Morris and the rest of the industry were mounting so fast and becoming so serious-40 state suits to recover tens of billions in Medicaid costs ; the looming prospect that the FDA might prohibit nicotine ; class-action suits buttressed by tobacco company documents leaked by whistle blowers-that he came to believe that settling was Philip Morris ' only real option . " Crocodile Dundee ran up against a politically ferocious crocodile , and he put down his knife , " says Paine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying peace , albeit at an astronomical price . " Of course , the big question is whether Philip Morris really has bought peace-or whether the settlement will backfire on the industry , allowing its critics to impose terms far more onerous than the settlement calls for ( see previous story ) . Still , there is one thing above all else to keep in mind about Philip Morris : No matter what happens to this settlement-whether it gets approved , shot down , or ( the most likely scenario ) overhauled-no other company has a better chance of surviving , and even thriving , in tobacco 's new and uncertain future . Not only the No. 1 cigarette seller worldwide , Philip Morris is also the biggest consumer-products company on the planet , and it has plenty of profits-not just from cigarettes but from powerful brands like Kraft , Maxwell House , and Miller beer-to buffer it from any major blow to U.S. tobacco . It had close to $13 billion in operating earnings last year , a number that far exceeds the $7 billion or so it would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Philip Morris ' future growth lies in places where tobacco is still accepted , consumers are less litigious , and the CEO is very comfortable : in overseas markets , where Bible 's big gambles earlier in his career are now providing Philip Morris with huge profits . As for Bible , it 's hard to believe he 's lost his willingness to fight back . In many ways , he and the company he heads are very much alike : scrappy , inventive , unconventionaland remarkably successful at turning setbacks into advantages . Born in the land of outlaws and castaways , Bible , 59 , began his tobacco career not in his native Australia but in Lausanne , Switzerland . He started at Philip Morris ' European division as a finance manager in 1968 . Bible then left Philip Morris for six years , but upon his return , he displayed the indefatigable spirit that 's marked him ever since . In 1981 he was assigned to manage his home territory , Australia , where Philip Morris was getting choked by a competitor , Rothmans . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bible once told FORTUNE . " We had a brand called Peter Jackson , and we put 30 cigarettes in the pack , " instead of the usual 20 . The brand 's market share nearly doubled in one year , and Philip Morris ' overall sales in Australia came roaring back . // THE BIBLE EFFECT // Thus did Bible establish himself as a brand builder in the classic Philip Morris tradition ( " Cost cutting is for losers , " the die-hard tobacco honchos say ) . Senior management plucked him from Down Under and promoted him to executive vice president and then president of Philip Morris ' entire international tobacco operations . He proved a shrewd and tireless strategist , selecting the most promising emerging markets and working with foreign ministers to secure favorable long-term conditions for Philip Morris . After communism collapsed in 1989 , Bible moved faster than his rivals to acquire local cigarette companies and factories in markets like Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union . Led by Bible 's international charge , Philip Morris passed Britain 's BAT Industries to become the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark days in the early 1990s , Bible again showed his ability to overcome obstacles . The CEO at the time was Michael Miles , who was Bible 's opposite in almost every way : a nonsmoker with no previous experience in tobacco ( he was a food marketer ) , methodical , dispassionate , aloof . While Bible was lighting up Philip Morris ' foreign cigarette business , the company 's biggest profit center , U.S. tobacco , was floundering . Greedy for short-term profit gains , the U.S. managers had been raising prices at more than twice the rate of inflation , and as a result , millions of smokers were abandoning Marlboro for cheap , generic alternatives . Philip Morris stock sagged . On April 2,1993-Marlboro Friday , as it became known-Philip Morris announced it would cut the price of a pack by 20% ; shocked investors , in turn , lopped off nearly 20% from the stock . Shareholders vilified Miles . Two weeks later , Miles put Bible in charge of the U.S. tobacco business . Instead of cutting back on marketing , which is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantially . Rivals such as R.J. Reynolds could n't afford to compete . Marlboro came roaring back , from 23% of the U.S. market to more than 33% today . By the time Miles resigned in June 1994 , Bible was the obvious choice to succeed him . " The worry was that Geoff was too type A , too much of a driver , with little tolerance for people who could n't keep up with him , " says Time Warner President Richard Parsons , a Philip Morris board member . " But Geoff turned out to be the perfect leader for the time . He 's the type who rolls up his sleeves , gets down with the troops , and helps lay the sandbags as the tide is roaring in . He 's a brilliant and committed warrior for an embattled company . " As CEO , Bible went on the warpath , railing against prohibitionist propaganda and staging media blitzes against the anti-tobacco forces . Inside Philip Morris , he has been a prickly and relentlessly demanding boss , but one who inspires the troops and engenders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Wall Street , Bible insisted that his top officers hole up at Philip Morris ' Park Avenue headquarters for two weeks and work on their presentations . The day before the show Bible ordered a runthrough , and he graded each executive . No one got above a D. The analysts ' meeting turned out to be a terrific success-Philip Morris ' stock market value gained $2 billion . Afterward , Bible sent handwritten thank-you notes and bottles of expensive wine to all the presenters . It is precisely Bible 's ferocity toward tobacco 's critics that caused so many people to be stunned when they learned last spring that the Philip Morris CEO had opened negotiations with its enemies . In fact , those who know him say that the litigation threat , severe though it was , was only part of his rationale . Most important was Philip Morris ' stock price . Bible once said about the stock , " Next to my wife and family , it is the most important thing in my life . " While Philip Morris has performed admirably during Bible 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion-the shares still sell at a dismal multiple to the company 's magnificent earnings . And it 's no secret why this is so : The litigation and regulatory threats created enormous uncertainty , and Wall Street hates uncertainty . As news about lawsuits caused the stock to gyrate , investors grew more wary . Bible knew he had to do something to bring investors certainty . Besides , a peace agreement with the enemies was n't a completely new idea at Philip Morris . Few people know it , but for at least the past decade , senior executives there had regularly discussed the idea of a negotiated settlement . The thinking was this : Big Tobacco needed to concede something every few years to keep the anti-smoking forces at bay . In 1966 , Philip Morris and its tobacco compatriots agreed to put warning labels on cigarette packs ; in 1971 , they accepted a ban on TV and radio advertising . In following years , the industry caved in to other restrictions and tax levies without enormous fuss . Finally , Bible came under the sway of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner who serves as Philip Morris ' general counsel , Bring believed a negotiated settlement was a viable way to solve tobacco 's problems . Bring , 62 , has become Bible 's most trusted adviser . Indeed , lawyers have become so important to tobacco companies these days that Bring was named vice chairman of Philip Morris a few months ago . As for Bible , he had the mindset of a foreigner-to him , the American legal system is out of whack , and negotiating with plaintiffs lawyers made no sense . But he was willing to listen to ideas . Early last year he started meeting secretly with another lawyer who was open to settling : RJR Nabisco CEO Steven Goldstone , a former litigator and dealmaker at the New York City law firm of Davis Polk &; Wardwell . The wheels really started to turn late last summer when Bible got a phone call from Martin Broughton , the CEO of Britishbased BAT Industries , which owns Brown &; Williamson Tobacco in the U.S. Broughton told Bible he believed the industry needed to do something major to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at RJR and Larry Tisch , the CEO of Loews , which owns Lorillard , and during the next six months , the tobacco chiefs convened monthly at various New York hotels , discussing the options . By March they agreed that peace talks were the rational way to end the war . At the first session of the negotiations in April , Bible was intense and buttoned-up : He read his 90second opening statement from index cards , saying essentially that Philip Morris was serious about striking a mutually beneficial peace . " We 're prepared for fundamental change in the way we do business , " he said . As the talks progressed , Bible was briefed daily . Then , at a climactic moment in mid-June when the talks nearly fell apart , he stepped in and showed himself to be the ultimate pragmatist . During a seven-hour meeting with the other CEOs , Bible helped persuade BAT 's Broughton to bend on a key issue , the FDA 's regulation of nicotine . Bible told Broughton that the deal offered was the best the companies would get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . They had to do a deal . What does the settlement mean for Philip Morris ? As currently written , it seems a pretty good deal for the company , despite the incredible price tag . Among the tobacco players , Philip Morris can best absorb the blow to profits and adapt to harsh new realities . Marketing restrictions will hurt the company , but they probably mean that Philip Morris will be able to lock in its dominant share , since competitors can less afford to pay the settlement costs and spend on their brands . Most important , Philip Morris has tremendous international growth that can offset hits to profits at home . The company 's international tobacco earnings have tripled since 1990 , to $4.1 billion a year . This year they 'll probably surpass cigarette profits in the U.S. Overseas tobacco is " our star business , " says Bible . Philip Morris " prospects look terrific with him in charge . Bible knows better than anyone else how to operate in regulated foreign markets , a number of which , incidentally , have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. Litigation is a minor concern in most overseas markets . It 's generally difficult to sue companies abroad , and besides , many governments are loath to attack Big Tobacco for fear of losing the huge cigarette taxes they reap . The rapid growth of Philip Morris ' international business undoubtedly helped relieve any concerns Bible had about a settlement leading to sales declines in the U.S. In the event the settlement deal becomes law , Bible 's strategy is fairly obvious . He will keep profits puffed up by significantly increasing cigarette prices in the U.S. Consumers will probably pay around 25% more for their Marlboros , Wall Street analysts say . He certainly wo n't ravage earnings or cash flow to pay the settlement costsnot if he can help it , anyway-nor will he likely cut Philip Morris ' healthy dividend , which Bible views as sacrosanct . He 'll reduce marketing spending but probably not as much as some people hope . Even though the settlement agreement requires the tobacco companies to pay penalties if they do n't vigorously try to reduce teenage smoking , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ targeting young adults . ( Philip Morris denies this . ) And therein lies the rub , for tobacco 's foes have already made it clear that they are going to do everything they can to prevent Bible from charging ahead in the cigarette market . They 'll do so by attempting to place far harsher restrictions on the deal , and a higher price tag . Which is why Geoff Bible is the right man to be running Philip Morris right now . If his has been a career of meeting challenges and overcoming obstacles , he-and his company-are now facing challenges and obstacles the like of which they 've never seen . Photograph Philip Morris ' general counsel Murray Bring ( right ) , a former partner at a top Washington firm , is Bible 's most trusted adviser . His knowledge of the capital should help Bible in the difficult months ahead . // <p>
