<p> Trekking for more than 2,000 miles across rugged wilderness , biologist Karsten Heuer has braved hazards from bears to avalanches on behalf of a bold conservation initiative <p> Nobody has to tell Karsten Heuer this is a little dangerous . A little foolhardy . But at this moment  --  a morning in late June  --  even if someone did try to advise Heuer against what he is about to undertake , Heuer in fact would have trouble hearing it . <p> That 's because , just upriver of where he 's lashing the last of his camping gear into the bottom of a yellow plastic canoe , the foaming thunder of Kinuseo Falls-taller than Niagara and pregnant with snowmelt this time of year-drowns out most any human sound . <p> In cloudy morning light , the cascade 's falling water hurls a gale wind downstream , sending curtains of mist sailing . Beneath these veils , the Murray River is a chocolate-brown roil of whirlpools and exploding currents , punctuated by whole uprooted trees rushing past on the flood . Heuer , 30 , a blond and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upstream toward the falls . " When we were last here , " he shouts , " that thing was frozen . This whole place was under six feet of snow . " <p> Heuer and his traveling partner , Leanne Allison , also 30 , last came past British Columbia 's Kinuseo Falls and its surrounding Monkman Provincial Park in mid-April , at the end of a backcountry ski trip made with a third friend , Jay Honeyman . By the time the three witnessed the frozen sculpture of Kinuseo Falls , they had skied nearly 250 deserted backcountry miles in 28 days , experiencing the snowy wilds of the Canadian Rockies the way few have since the Canadian trappers of old . <p> Reaching Kinuseo Falls in April ended the second of four legs on Heuer 's Yellowstone-to-Yukon Hike , a two-year , 2,000-mile backcountry odyssey that 's equal parts low-key promotional tour and ground survey . As Heuer moves slowly north under his own power , he stops in towns to meet with a support van , change into clean clothes , and give slide presentations about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposal to conserve or reweave connections between habitat areas along the northern half of the Rocky Mountains . <p> From the greater Yellowstone ecosystem in the south to the Yukon 's Mackenzie Mountains up north-an area encompassing roughly 460,000 square miles-Heuer is also walking to make note of highways , fences , clear-cuts , railroads and uncontrolled urban developments that present obstacles to the free flow of animals , especially large carnivores , which require enormous habitat ranges to hunt and reproduce successfully . As reported by the World Wildlife Fund Canada , for instance , scientists estimate that to protect a population of 500 grizzly bears in the Rockies from the effects of disease , inbreeding and habitat de struction , almost 50,000 square miles is required . Unfortunately , that 's an area 15 times the size of Yellowstone . <p> " Our belief , " Heuer says , " is that if we can conserve the migratory corridors these large carnivores use to travel from conserved area to conserved area inside the system , the small animals will be conserved as well-since the large animals require so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , near the base of Kinuseo Falls , the only animal migration Heuer can afford to worry about is his own . He and Allison have lugged their canoe and equipment more than a mile over a low mountain to get here , and both are raring to go . They work efficiently , but their usually quick smiles and genial humor are now supplanted by tight-mouthed silence . While both Heuer and Allison are expert white-water boaters , a streak of unseasonably hot weather has released a huge amount of high-country snow as meltwater-and the river is dangerously full . Add to this that regular parade of uprooted trees ( which may jam together beneath bridges or across rock bars downstream to create unavoidable obstacles ) and the tension seems justifiable . <p> Heuer steps into his place at the canoe 's stern , kneeling to keep the boat 's center of gravity low . In seconds , he is as focused as an arrow in mid-flight . <p> " Come on , Web , " he says to his dog , a 6-year-old Border collie named Webster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master . Heuer pats the pile of waterproof bags in the center of the canoe . " Time to go , boy . Come on . " <p> The sleek black-and-white pooch stares quizzically at Heuer for a moment , then does as he 's told , stepping off the beach and unsteadily onto the bags . As the dog curls up , Allison slips into the canoe 's bow and kneels as well . Together , she and Heuer lift their paddles and back-ferry off the rocky beach . <p> A tree drifts past . Three more logs spin along the beach 's eddy . " OK , let 's go , " Heuer says as the river flows momentarily free of snags . With a few smooth paddle strokes-solidly mechanical as an outboard motor-the yellow canoe slices through the eddy line and seamlessly enters the current , setting out on a journey toward some of North America 's largest remaining wilderness . <p> The idea for a Yellowstone-to-Yukon ( Y2Y ) Conservation Initiative has its roots in the early 1990s , when a now-40-year-old Calgary man named Harvey Locke-a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stanch human development in bear , wolf and elk habitats . <p> Locke , a fifth-generation descendant of European settlers in Alberta ( mountain passes and valleys across the Canadian Rockies are named for his family ) , came up with some surprising data in preparing for his cases . " I was reading a book called Wild Hunters : Predators in Peril by Monte Hummel and Sherry Pettigrew , " Locke says . The study suggested that large carnivores require more range than had been assumed previously . <p> Locke also found other evidence that these animals need more area to survive than originally thought . A study by two biologists-Paul Paquet , a Canadian , and Diane Boyd , an American-followed three radio-collared wolves for two years , discovering that they ranged as far as 60,000 square miles each . One wolf roamed from the Flathead Valley in Montana all the way north to the Alaska Highway-more than 600 linear miles . <p> Finally , Locke had been studying the Wildlands Project , a 1991 proposal to set aside large areas of the North American continent as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by wildlife corridors . " I 'd been thinking about all this , " Locke continues , " and one night in 1993-on a backcountry trip to the Redfern-Keily Park of British Columbia-it came together in my mind . I was sitting by the campfire . The place was so beautiful , I began outlining a discussion paper for a Northern Rockies preserve right on the edge of my topographic map . The words ' Yellowstone-to-Yukon ' actually appeared on my map 's edge that night by the fire . It seemed to crystallize what a lot of people had been thinking about . " <p> Before long , the Y2Y Conservation Initiative spawned positive input from a chorus of noted biologists , including Paquet and Boyd , and the Craighead Environmental Research Institute , the Sonoran Institute and members of the Society for Conservation Biology . A map , delineating the study zone for future conservation planning , was drawn up . That area stretches 1,600 miles north to south along the spine of the Northern Rockies . Inside the Y2Y territory , the goal is to create a protected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing national wilderness areas and provincial parks-connected by a network of wildlife corridors . Surrounding these preserves and their arteries would be buffer zones : larger " multiple-use areas " where managed human endeavors like mining and logging can carry on at varying levels . Hunting and sportfishing would continue in the region . <p> " You 've got to incorporate human activity into this from the outset , " Locke says . " After all , a million people live inside the proposed Y2Y range , and some take their living from the land . You ca n't alienate the people living here and expect to succeed . If , for instance , the ranchers do n't agree , then key private land connections will be lost . " <p> For Karsten Heuer , joining the Y2Y crowd " just made sense . " As a backcountry ranger and biologist , Heuer had already spent years investigating the movements of large carnivores in Banff and beyond when , in 1994 , he first learned of Y2Y . " Soon as I heard it , " he says , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' I 'd been doing research on cougars and wolves- reading the literature as well as doing fieldwork-and the scale of the problem had already jumped out at me . " <p> Further reinforcing Y2Y 's goals in Heuer 's mind was a 1996 work ex change he had done on a wildlife reserve in South Africa . As a visiting biologist , he 'd worked with a veterinarian to restore several types of large carnivore-lions , cheetahs and African wild dogs-to that country 's Madikwe Game Reserve . " We were trying to return these populations to the southern Kalahari Desert , near the Botswana border , " he says . " We were manipulating migrations , upsetting biodiversity systems that had already crumbled to the point-in some cases-of near extinction . And it was very expensive . " <p> The cost of the African wild-dog reintroduction especially rang with Heuer . At about $30,000 apiece , six wild dogs were introduced to Madikwe in 1995 . After their release , during the period that Heuer was in South Africa , the dogs thrived ; before long , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a bite from a rabid jackal felled the pack 's alpha male . Within a month , the virus had killed 21 pack members . <p> " Somewhere during this time , " Heuer says , " I realized the value of what we still have here in the Northern Rockies , and that we need to conserve it . I got to wondering , is the level of migration that Y2Y is suggesting even possible ? So I decided to travel the proposed Y2Y zone as an animal would , as a symbolic grizzly bear or wolf . " <p> Fortunately , in 1,400 miles of overland travel so far , Heuer is proud of pointing out , he 's crossed 92 mountain passes and run into 11 grizzlies but has encountered only eight major highways . " So as a conservation initiative , Y2Y still has a strong chance to succeed , " he adds . " There are possible solutions . We can dig wildlife underpasses beneath what few roads or rail lines currently block the corridor , or we can erect wildlife overpasses above them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for all the cautious planning and hopeful talk , the Y2Y proposal has found its share of critics , some of whom are eager to share their opinions with Heuer . When he stopped to give a slide show in the ranching town of Augusta , Montana , for instance , " there was one guy in particular , " Heuer says , chuckling . " He was a rancher named Ray Krone ... Man , he grilled me . " <p> Krone , 75 , is paterfamilias of a 60,000-acre Montana cattle ranch that 's been in his family for generations . And while Krone has " nothing personal against Karsten Heuer , " he is n't reluctant to air an opposing opinion , either . " Anything that takes management of land away from a rancher or private citizen , " Krone says , " I 'm generally against . Usually because it costs me and other ranchers like me a lot of money . Like the wolf reintroduction-why would a rancher want that ? " <p> Krone tells of a neighbor who allowed the U.S. Fish and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property . " Before long , " Krone says , " there were 23 wolves in that pack . They moved onto my place and killed a calf a day ... an occurrence which was extremely hard to prove since the wolves eat everything-even the skin and bones . Ultimately , an agency offered to reimburse me for two calves that year . How can I run a successful ranch when I lose a calf a day to a government wildlife policy ? " <p> Heuer , for his part , does n't expect to change everyone 's mind . Instead , like a circuit rider from a century ago , he 's simply traveling to these outlands as a voice for the Y2Y proposal . " All I can do , " he says , " is give another perspective . Ultimately Y2Y will have to be agreed to by everyone , or it wo n't be enacted . I 'm just trying to get the word out . " <p> And Krone is not worrying alone . Upon Y2Y 's an nouncement , the news magazine British Columbia Report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that humans in the Y2Y zone were the animals needing most urgent protection . Then came the Forest Alliance of British Columbia , which published its own review on the Y2Y implementation , noting it may cost British Columbia 80,000 jobs . Another organization , Canada 's North Central Municipal Association-a body made up of elected officials across north-central British Columbia-passed a resolution last spring opposing Y2Y , stating publicly they will not support what they view as Y2Y 's stricter land-use policies . <p> At the same time , Y2Y is being embraced in some quarters . More than 200 U.S. and Canadian individuals and environmental and conservation groups have signed on as affiliates , and localized Y2Y management districts across the proposed zone-to better address each area 's needs and political landscapes-have started to coalesce . <p> In some places , Y2Y principles already have been implemented . Recently , using a Y2Y-style , multiuse roundtable approach to define everyone 's needs , the government of British Columbia has protected more than 2.5 million acres of public wilderness . The protected land , in the northern part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of special management area . Fortunately , these lands lie within the proposed Y2Y study area . <p> No one may be more aware of the divisive realities confronting Y2Y 's success than Karsten Heuer . After all , in scores of stops along his route , he 's been taking the public 's temperature about the plan for more than a year . <p> Tonight , Heuer will make his speech in the pretty little town of Hudson 's Hope , British Columbia . Set between gorgeous lines of forested ridges and headed by a massive hydroelectric complex that supplies power to much of two Canadian provinces , Hudson 's Hope is a perfect petri dish in which to view the conflicting opinions on Y2Y . <p> In the parking lot outside the town 's community center-sided in robin's-egg blue-much of the town seems to be turning out to hear Heuer speak . Shortly after the doors open , the center 's white interior is filled with every stripe of Hudson 's Hoper . Neat middle-class families have arrived to sit in the front row , their young children jazzed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweeping mountain vistas . Velcro-sneakered retirees file in , too . As do Guy and Mary Armitage , the local beekeepers . And coming in last , there 's a seemingly solid phalanx of sturdy men just off their shifts on timber skidders and earthmovers . They 're still in dusty T-shirts , jeans and heavy steel-toed boots ; on their belts , they wear GPS receivers and cellular telephones and big knives . <p> Then the lights dim and the show begins . While Heuer downplays his ability as a public speaker , he is remarkably effective at translating Y2Y 's underpinnings and goals-not to mention the glorious breadth of his adventure-in accessible and nonthreatening language . Using straightforward slides , some complete with figures and mission statements , he defines what Y2Y is and the reasons for creating the conservation zones . Interspersed with these , he tells stories paired to slides of knee-bucklingly dramatic Rocky Mountain landscapes . <p> Since June 6 , 1998 , when Heuer began his Y2Y Hike from the shores of Mammoth Hot Springs in Yellowstone National Park-carrying a backpack of donated food and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Banff National Park-he and his hiking companions have seemingly always had a camera ready . They have captured a North American wilderness that ca n't be seen from the pavement . <p> On the first leg of his trip , from Yellowstone to Jasper , Alberta , sticking to lands inside the proposed Y2Y range , Heuer pieced together a path on which he spent 61 of 114 days in protected wildlife areas . Often hiking ridgetops blown free of late-season snow , just as an animal wanting to avoid human contact would , Heuer and Maxine Achurch-a friend who helped organize the hike-merged onto what seemed to be wildlife highways . " We saw hundreds of individual tracks , " Heuer says , showing a photograph of a muddy mountaintop trail through massive snowfields . " Wolves , elk , bears , wolverines , everything Y2Y is proposing to conserve moved along this same trail . " In fact , on all but 19 of those first 114 days , Heuer says , evidence of grizzly bears was found . <p> When Achurch departed after six weeks , Heuer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not seen a person for days , they camped in a " wind tunnel of sculpted rock at the bottom of a valley in Montana 's Big Belt Mountains . " A horrendous storm blew up , knocking Heuer 's tent flat and destroying his campsite . In the deafening noise , Heuer could n't tell if boulders were tumbling down the valley walls , threatening his camp . He spent the remainder of the night out of the tent , wrapped in a tarp and freezing . Under the tarp , Webster cowered between Heuer 's legs as hail and icy rain slammed them in a blistering wind . " I was shivering uncontrollably ; I thought I might die of exposure that night , " he says . " But I got through it by saying , over and over again : ' This is only temporary , this is only temporary . ' And the next morning , the day dawned beautiful . " <p> After northward traveling visits by his father ( a Calgary-based city planner ) , mother ( a real estate agent ) and sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heuer and Webster again spent several weeks alone in the wilderness . One evening , in Canada 's Waterton Lakes National Park-just across the U.S./Canadian border from Montana 's Glacier National Park-Heuer searched for hours for a rare campsite without sign of grizzly bears . Everywhere he looked he saw bear scat , and boulders tipped over and logs torn apart- the work of bears searching for grubs and insects-and fur in tree bark where bears had been rubbing up against the trunks . Finally , after Heuer felt he 'd found an area safe from bears , he heard a helicopter land in the distance as night fell . The next day he found out what happened . " A man had been killed by a grizzly less than a mile away from where I was camped , " Heuer says . " And while that was a tragedy , I also thought : that 's the wilderness . We 're not the top of the food chain out there ... and that adds an edge to the experience that I kind of respect . " <p> Heuer 's trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's first stretch-1,200 miles from Yellowstone to Jasper , Alberta-was completed between June and October of 1998 . His second leg was the March to April backcountry ski from Jasper to Kinuseo Falls , which spanned almost 250 miles . The third , beginning with the canoe trip on the Murray River , will turn into a 400-mile hike along the Continental Divide to the headwaters of the Gataga River in northern British Columbia . ( The fourth and final leg , another combined canoe trip and hike along the Gataga/Kechika river system , was completed in early September at Watson Lake , Yukon-more than 2,000 twisty mountain miles from where he started . When he reached Watson Lake , Heuer had hiked past the headwaters of ten major river systems , seen most of the region 's 70 different mammal species , walked along rivers teeming with 118 different types of fish and crossed the nesting areas of more than 275 species of bird . ) <p> By the time the 40-minute show has ended , the people of Hudson 's Hope have been led by Heuer on a trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to cache a string of ten-day provisions before each leg begins : in steel canisters and high in trees , to frustrate bears and wolverines . They have heard that Heuer has only a few dollars in his bank account ; that he and Leanne Allison and Jay Honeyman struggled to advance just two miles a day on the trip 's ski section ; that during the Y2Y Hike 's ski leg , Heuer released an entire mountain snowfield in an avalanche-fortunately , without lethal consequences . <p> Near the end of his show , Heuer flashes a slide that seems to focus all of what Y2Y means . It 's a broad green valley , ringed by jagged and glaciated peaks . Heuer points to a tiny cliff ledge near the front of the photograph . " This is in the backcountry of Waterton Lakes National Park , in Alberta , " Heuer says . " I remember sitting on this knife-edge ridge , watching a wolf leaping around and mousing across the grass in the valley below . It was so wild , so beautiful . I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tears welled up in my eyes . " <p> Then the lights come up ; Heuer opens the floor to questions . Some of them are curious and polite : Does he carry a gun ? " No , it 's too heavy . " Has Webster traveled the entire distance ? " No , not on the ski leg , because the snow was too deep . Though , if you could ask him , old Web would probably say he could have made it . " <p> Two men , on different sides of the aisle , pipe up . Both want to know what this proposal will mean to hunters . One of them , Ian Stacey , wants to make sure Y2Y wo n't compromise sportsmen . " As long as hunting is done sustainably , " Heuer says , " I see no conflict with the Y2Y vision . " <p> The other gentleman , Wayne McIver , is concerned about a few of the 200 sponsors already signed on with Y2Y . Some are antihunting . How does Y2Y jibe with that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We have not joined theirs . They have an agenda , but it is n't our agenda . They have merely signed on in support of Y2Y-which does n't mean we support the programs they 're pushing for individually . " <p> Ian Stacey is determined not to have Y2Y 's stance on hunting " talked around . " He asks again about potential restrictions . The take-home message , Heuer responds , is that Y2Y is not antihunting ; decisions must be made concerning what levels of hunting are acceptable to everyone . " We recognize that everyone-hunters , loggers , miners , recreational users-has an interest in maintaining the wilderness for the future , " Heuer says . " The challenge will be in doing this to everyone 's satisfaction . I think it can be done . " <p> Then , with an almost audible break , the meeting is over . People mill over the Y2Y T-shirts and calendars Erica Heuer is selling at the back of the room . And hunters Stacey and McIver walk out into the last rays of the day 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skeptical , they 've emerged at least still open-minded . <p> As Bill Lindsay , town administrator of Hudson 's Hope , locks up the community center for the night , he also appears to be cautiously agreeable . " I think most people worry about the Y2Y proposal affecting their jobs and ways of life , which is only realistic , " he says . " Karsten and his program helped calm them a little , I think . It 's a good show , but there 's still a lot of convincing to do . " <p> Back on the Murray River , Karsten Heuer and Leanne Allison are having a little fun-blowing off steam now that the tumble of Kinuseo Falls is safely behind them . In the fast-moving water , they are carried downstream at perhaps ten miles an hour , the water 's surface gradually growing calmer as the river passes between snowcapped peaks . To Allison , this smoothing of the still-brown river 's surface means it 's time for fun . " Keep us steady , " she says over her shoulder to Heuer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Leaning forward , hands clutching the gunwales of the canoe , arms pressuring the boat 's interior as it skims along , Allison slowly goes bottoms up . First her head drops to the canoe 's floor . Then , slowly , her nylon-panted legs and sandaled feet rise skyward until , for a full minute or so , she stands inverted in the canoe-legs wavering in the air-before lowering herself back to more balanced safety . <p> Webster seems relieved when Allison has returned to a more tenable position inside the boat . An accomplished yoga practitioner , Allison is a consummate outdoorsperson in her own right . In 1993 , she was a member of the first all-female team to summit Mount Logan , Canada 's highest peak , via the east ridge route , and she has done glaciology research only 300 miles from the South Pole . As a friend of Heuer 's since the two were 5-year-olds , she signed on for the remainder of the trip . Back in her seat , her knit cap dripping from the inch of icy , standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grinning . <p> Heuer is smiling , too . Foot by foot , problem by problem , recalcitrant rancher by recalcitrant rancher , he is doing all he can to turn the Y2Y Conservation Initiative into a reality . With friends along and his dog at his side-and with the future of some of North America 's most remote wilderness hanging in the balance-Karsten Heuer dips his paddle into the Murray River once again , and steers gently forward . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Seeking to follow the movements of large carnivores , including wolves , whose tracks mark the trail at left , Heuer has hiked the enormous range required by these animals .
