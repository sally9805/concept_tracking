But then , few in Wisconsin or Washington knew James Lee Witt . <P> A native of Wildcat Hollow , Arkansas , Witt , 49 , had only three months earlier taken charge of the Federal Emergency Management Agency , long derided as a dumping ground for political hacks and feckless bureaucrats . Most recently , FEMA was blamed for mishandling relief efforts after Hurricane Andrew . Witt has brought to the agency the frontline verve he had shown in official posts in Arkansas where , when snowstorms closed rural roads , he could be found standing on the tailgate of a pickup truck , spreading salt to clear the way for motorists . In times of flood , Witt stacked sandbags and drove a bulldozer . <P> When the Mississippi River jumped its banks in early July , Witt was eager to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Described by friends as deeply religious and penny-pinching , Witt shunned the perks of his $136,300 post and flew by commercial plane .

And his 20-year friendship with the President has given Witt clout among Cabinet agencies with which his agency must coordinate $ emergency relief . But Witt has also won praise for his energetic efforts to reform and streamline the hapless agency . On his desk , he placed a warning , penned on a plain sheet of paper : WHEN ENTERING THIS ROOM , DO NOT SAY " WE 'VE NEVER DONE IT THIS WAY BEFORE . " <P> Witt has made four visits to the flood region and has swiftly provided victims with cash and other help , including a fleet of massive trucks that offer emergency communications , electrical power and water purification . Even FEMA 's most vociferous congressional critic , Senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland , seems to have softened , saying of Witt , " He absolutely gets A 's for effort .
