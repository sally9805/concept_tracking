When Heather LaBrie Shears encountered feeding problems with her newborn baby a year ago , she was reduced to tears more than once . " It 's all my fault , " thought the Fredericton room , overcome with worry and guilt . The same desperation echoed loudly in cyberspace when a woman named Lisa left a message at the Today 's Parent Web site . " Help ! " she implored , " my daughter is on a hunger strike ! My husband and I are going out of our minds with worry ! " Meanwhile , in Hanwell , N.B. , the Fraser family was slogging through their own food fight . Just about every time Trina and her husband , Lawrence , sat down to dinner with three-year-old Austin , they 'd wind up frustrated and angry . " He never eats well , " says Trina , " and we end up badgering him all the time . " There 's no doubt about it : When it comes to food , emotions run high . And nowhere is the balance between peace and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why do so many families get stuck battling it out over food ? Are we using bread and butter for sustenance , or are we using it as a parenting tool  --  a reward , a threat , a comfort ? Moreover , how come parents feel rejected when a child does n't cat ? Are we mistaking food for love ? According to Ellyn Satter , a Madison , Wisconsin dietitian and family therapist , food can equal love , especially at birth , when " nourishment is absolutely synonymous with nurturance . " Yes , food fuels babies " empty tanks , but it is also one of the ways that parents show love for their child . When a parent feeds a baby sensitively , following the child 's lead and reading his unspoken cues , that parent is , according to Satter , providing him with profound messages of acceptance and understanding . When mother and baby share a breastfeeding relationship , this bond becomes both an emotional and a physical one . But as children grow , they get love in many other ways . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coined the term " feeding relationship " and has come out with three books and a video to help parents navigate this rocky terrain . " Food is a very hot area of conflict for families , " says Toronto child psychotherapist Janet Morrison . " Parents get worried and anxious when they perceive their children as not eating right . " What 's worse , they often take it personally . Morrison points out that parents tend to judge themselves according to how their children eat . If their child is a " good " eater , then they feel like good parents . Unfortunately the opposite also holds true , and many parents end up feeling rejected when their child refuses food . " Parents put a lot of effort , planning , time and money into food preparation , " explains Morrison . When a child responds with " Yuck ! I do n't want it ! " many feel undermined and unappreciated . Why do we get into these conflicts ? Largely because our attitudes about food are often driven by " shoulds , " " do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that people should eat regular amounts of food at regular intervals . It 's an intellectual approach . But kids are different . Young children , especially babies , follow their bodies ' signals and operate instinctually . It does n't matter what time it is or how hungry ( or not hungry ) they " should " be . They simply feel it . So when More looks at her watch and says " Mealtime , " Junior might just say , " I 'm not hungry . " Kids " erratic eating habits do n't help matters , says feeding guru Satter . " What children love to eat one day , they 'll reject the next day . They 'll eat a lot one day , then nothing the next . They 'll go on food jags and eat the same food every day . Then suddenly , they 'll go off that food and wo n't touch it for another year and a haiti " While these inconsistencies can drive parents crazy , the truth is that unpredictable eating patterns are absolutely normal for children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when allowed to decide for themselves how much to eat , will naturally regulate their food intake . They wo n't starve , nor will they overeat . ( Occasionally , parents do have reason to worry . It 's wise to consult with your child 's doctor about chronic under- or overeating patterns  --  there could be an underlying health problem . ) So , in order for children to eat " normally , " they need their parents to trust and respect their internal cues . Satter has devised what she calls a " division of responsibility " to help us do just that . She says parents should be responsible for providing a variety of nutritious foods at scheduled mealtimes , as well as snacks throughout the day . Children , on the other hand , ought to be left in charge of what they actually consume . " Many parents dictate what and how much their child should eat , " points out Satter . Children who are compliant will probably go along , but those who are more assertive might put up a fight . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will lose the ability to know how hungry or how full he is because he is eating according to his parent 's agenda , rather than by what goes on inside of him . " The big message is trust . Yet faith is hard to muster , especially when we think our kids are too fat or too thin . Trina Fraser , for example , describes her son Austin as " skinny . " She says that he has never eaten well and that you can " see his ribs and hip bones when he has no clothes on . " Despite her doctor 's assurances that her son is doing just fine , Fraser worries . She agrees that Austin appears energetic and appropriately developed , but her son 's eating just does n't seem " normal . " A parent 's attitude toward her child 's eating affects the overall framework of the feeding relationship , says Karen Webber , a registered dietitian and nutritionist in Kelowna , B.C. " But sometimes parents find it hard to trust kids because they have difficulty trusting themselves around food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with our bodies ' cues . When we eat , is it because we are hungry or bored , sad or stressed out ? Society 's obsession with thinness does n't help , nor does our madcap variety of dieting potions , low-fat foods and weight-loss regimes . As a result , a great number of parents , especially mothers , have a love-hate attitude toward food . This negativity is bound to trickle down . In addition , children learn by watching , so when parents skip meals or do n't take the time to sit down to eat , kids get a definite message . Sometimes we contradict ourselves : We say all the right things to our kids , then we look in the mirror and let our children hear us mumble , " I hate my body . I 'm not eating until all this fat is gone . " For preteens , especially girls , that kind of example can encourage a negative body image . So we need to be aware of our own attitudes toward food . Psychologists say one way to do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kwong Hing of Toronto remembers being forbidden to eat certain foods . " I was deprived of all junk food as a child , " she says . " My parents were very strict about it . And I remember sneak-eating as a teen . " Consequently , Kwong Hing tries not to deprive her two daughters , Kortney , eight , and Kailyn , seven , of any particular foods . That does n't mean that they can have any foods they want at any time , but it does mean that both " good " and " bad " foods have a place in their diets . " Once a week , usually Thursdays , we go to the store and I let them buy whatever " crap " they want with their allowance , " she says . " It takes them forever to decide  --  it 's their choice . It gives them some control , and I think they really like that . " It feels great to be in control  --  whether you are three or 43 years old . Just ask Heather LaBrie Shears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a screen door when she was a child . The funny thing is that LaBrie Shears ca n't tell you what the meatloaf tasted like . She can only remember how she felt when her father demanded that it disappear . To this day , LaBrie Shears avoids meatloaf and respects that her sons , Eric , three , and Kyle , one , have food preferences , too . " Generally , I know that I am just wasting my breath getting involved in a power struggle over food with my kids , " says LaBrie Shears . " Sure , sometimes I think it 's worth a try . Then once I get into it I realize that it is a losing battle . " Research confirms what parents like LaBrie Shears have learned through experience . In her book How to Get Your Kid to Eat ... But Not Too Much , Satter cites numerous studies showing that when parents deprive children of food , children react by wanting more . They are likely to become preoccupied with food , and to become prone to overeating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they become revolted by food and undereating becomes a concern . Understanding your child 's " food temperament " is another key to a successful feeding relationship . According to Toronto registered dietitian and Today Parent Quick Cuisine columnist Rosie Schwartz , kids approach food in many different ways . " Some kids are more aware of their discomfort levels when they are full than others , " says Schwartz . " Some feel hunger more intensely . Some kids have big appetites and some are n't very interested in food . There are adventurous eaters and there are picky eaters . We have to respect our kids ' likes and dislikes . " Without even thinking , parents can give kids the wrong messages about food . When a child scrapes her knee , for example , we might try to make it better with an ice cream cone . But eating for comfort , says Schwartz , leads kids to eat not because they 're hungry , but because they feel bad . Likewise , she cautions parents against rewarding good behaviour with a treat .

" Now , as the mother of a four-year-old , Gillet is struggling with " an extra 40 pounds " and has spent time thinking about her feeding relationship with son Matthew . " I never force him to finish his food and I never push him to eat when he 's not hungry . Matthew knows when to stop , " says Gillet confidently . " Sometimes he eats so little I wonder how he survives . Other times , he eats so much I wonder where he puts it all ! But I know that he eats what he needs . " No matter how you slice it , children do best when we butt out and let them chew in peace . But that does n't mean we should avoid opportunities to break bread with our kids . Your daughter may be able to make a sandwich and eat it alone , but studies show that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sitting at the table with her . Members of Don McCreary 's family already know this . " Mealtimes are happy times , " says the Calgary dad . " We like to share the day 's events during supper . The food is almost secondary . " Even though McCreary and his wife , Caran Magaw , have three children with very different tastes , they have been able to find a middle ground when it comes to mealtime . " My job is to make dinner and put it on the table , " says Magaw . " I make lots of food and variety . I tell them to choose and eat what they like . I try to focus on the positive . " Magaw describes her 13-year-old son , Tyler , as a fussy eater who loves raw carrots . Robyn , four , eats no fruits or vegetables , unless they have been " sneaked into a spaghetti sauce . " The youngest , Caley , is almost two and loves to eat vegetables . All these different preferences could be a recipe for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more important to us than what the kids are consuming . " Eating does n't have to mean food fights  --  with yourself or your children . After all , a delicious meal can be a great shared pleasure . Brenda Kwong Hing , her husband , Al , and their two daughters enjoy " that togetherness feeling " regularly . " Kortney and Kailyn like to get their noses right in there , the moment I start to cook . There I am , with one square foot of counter space to work with , squeezed between one child on my right and the other on my left ! You could say we 've done a lot of chopping , slicing , peeling , mixing , stirring and measuring together  --  but we love it . " Thanksgiving means turkey at the Kwong Hing household , and on birthdays , it is Chinese long-life noodles . Kwong Hing admits to " using food as an excuse " to invite people over to have some fun . She ca n't imagine a celebration without something good to eat . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple weekday meal , dining together " is very special , it gives us a sense of family . " And when her eldest responds to a meal with " Oh Mommy , this is faaaabulous , " it 's just the icing on the cake . When to eat your words There 's a big difference , says dietitian and family therapist Ellyn Satter , between praising your child for her appetite , and simply acknowledging what she 's eating . When you say , " Oh , is n't that great , you ate all your broccoli ! You 're such a good girl ! " you are actually pushing a child to eat , rather than letting her discover food for herself . Instead , we can offer more neutral support with comments like , " Oh , I see you tried your broccoli . What do you think of it with that cheese sauce ? " And by keeping our statements low-key and matter-of-fact , we avoid making too big a deal about food . At the same time , we prevent a compliant child from eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In many cases , silence is the best policy when it comes to your child 's consumption . But Satter points out that parents often show approval or disapproval without even saying a word . " All it takes is a look , a glare or a twitch of the eyebrows , " she says . Children are extremely perceptive and they know exactly what mom and dad mean when they give them a look for taking too many helpings of food , or not enough . If you tend to worry about what your kids eat , and you think this might show in your body language or facial expressions , try engaging your children ( age permitting ) in lively dinner-table discussions about topics that interest all of you .
