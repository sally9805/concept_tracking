The suspense is not as tightly wound as it might be . The mystery is not as deep or , when unraveled , as stunning as it could be . The detective ( Aidan Quinn ) is a little more crudely macho than he needs to be . <P> But all that is unimportant , for Blink has two terrific things going for it . One is director Michael Apted 's gritty use of Chicago as a setting . He makes you feel the wind in your bones , and he puts its blue-collar toughness in your face all the time . The other is Madeleine Stowe . <P> Her intensity was visible but somewhat shaded in Short Cuts and The Last of the Mohicans . In Blink she lets it rip . Emma Brody , blinded in early childhood , plays the violin in an Irish rock band , and onstage she looks ethereal . Offstage her anger is like an exposed nail ; it catches and tears at everyone who brushes against it . As the result of an operation , Emma begins to recover her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world of blurs and shadows is scarier to her than the darkness she has known . One of these developing shadows , as it happens , is that of the man who murdered her upstairs neighbor . This means , of course , that he is going to stalk her . <P> She covers her fear with ferocity and blistering outrage at the ineptitude of the cops on the case . When she becomes romantically involved with Quinn , their love scenes have the scratch-and-bite fury that people generate when they are not at all sure they 're doing the right thing . Whatever she 's doing , however , Stowe transforms an ordinary sort of movie into something extraordinary .
