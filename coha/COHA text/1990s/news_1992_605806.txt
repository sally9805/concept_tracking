<p> Washington Redskins Coach Joe Gibbs still remembers the knot of fear and anxiety that grew in the pit of his stomach that day in 1981 when he was told that team owner Jack Kent Cooke was on his way to Redskin Park for a face-to-face meeting . <p> Gibbs was then five weeks into an NFL head coaching career that would see him become one of the fastest 100-game winners in history , that would see him get to four Super Bowls in a 10-year stretch , including next Sunday 's appearance in Super Bowl XXVI against Buffalo , and would see him run up the best postseason winning percentage in history ( 14-4 , .778 ) . But that day as he sat in his office , he sat with an 0-5 record . <p> His Redskins had just lost No. 5 , this one 30-17 to the San Francisco 49ers at RFK Stadium . They 'd been booed by their fans and 49ers Coach Bill Walsh had walked over to the home locker room to offer encouragement . Columnists and sportscasters did n't understand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where he was offensive coordinator . And the feeling across much of a city that adores its football team was that what Vince Lombardi and George Allen had worked so hard to establish was being torn apart by the new coach . <p> Gibbs assumed that Cooke agreed . " I told myself , ' Hey , I 'm getting fired , ' " Gibbs said . " A lot of things race through your mind . " <p> He was stunned when Cooke sat across from him that day and , in a short meeting , said : " You 're going to turn this around . You 're going to do it . You 've got what it takes . Now , get back to work . " <p> Gibbs was flabbergasted . " That was the first time I 'd dealt with Mr. Cooke in the tough times , " he said , " and he has always been the same . He has been like a rock at times when we 've been the lowest . I 've always said you do n't know what kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad times . We 've been through them here . Mr. Cooke is at his best when you 're being tested . " <p> Now , as the Redskins prepare for their fourth Super Bowl in a span of 10 years  --  a dazzling run of success for a coach who went seven consecutive seasons ( 1984-90 ) without a first-round draft choice , yet has never really had a rebuilding period  --  that 1981 conversation between Gibbs and Cooke partly explains the Redskins ' success . <p> In a sport where the average player 's career lasts about 3 1/2 years , where almost every team expects a 30 percent turnover from year to year , the few constants are n't on the field , but in the front office : Cooke , Gibbs and General Manager Charley Casserly . <p> Cooke , at 79 , is a difficult man to work for and deal with in many respects . He is a hands-on owner in all his businesses , including the Redskins . But he lets Gibbs coach . And he lets Casserly manage , just as he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Cooke has an opinion on almost everything , though , and is n't shy about sharing them with Gibbs and Casserly . It 's Cooke who designed an organization that has succeeded in a league that designs its schedule to work against the teams on top . His son John is president of the Redskins and handles most of the day-to-day decisions  --  " and he has done a marvelous job , " Jack Kent Cooke said . " He does n't get enough credit , but he 's a big reason for our success . " <p> In an era when men who own professional sports teams occasionally see themselves as both coaches and general managers , Cooke clearly lets football people make football decisions . He talks to Casserly or Gibbs almost every day either on the phone or in his visits to Redskin Park . <p> Cooke is the reason Gibbs can begin each season with a dozen players stashed on injured reserve , earning a paycheck although not allowed to play in the games . He 's the reason the Redskins lead all NFL teams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can protect only 37 of about 50 to 60 players under contract at the conclusion of each season ) . Cooke has spent $ 3 million on such players over the past three years , signing from other teams , among others , safety Danny Copeland , defensive tackle Jumpy Geathers and linebacker Matt Millen . <p> The NFL can look at the Redskins and see another formula for success : a coach who comes up with new ideas , excellent personnel decisions , and exceptional determinations on strategy during halftimes of games . <p> He wins with a multiple offense that does n't rely on one person ( although quarterback Mark Rypien had an all-pro year ) and a defense that wins with three all-pro quality players ( Wilber Marshall , Darrell Green and Charles Mann ) and a lot of role players who fit perfectly in defensive coach Richie Petitbon 's myriad schemes . <p> When Beathard and Gibbs wanted to spend $ 6 million and two first-round draft choices on Chicago Bears star Marshall four years ago , Cooke said no . He had no problem with signing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up two draft picks sounded like a bad idea . A couple of days later , Beathard and Gibbs phoned and asked again . Again , Cooke said no . <p> But when they called a third time , Cooke remembers saying : " Oh , all right if that 's what you want to do . I do n't agree with it , but if you do , fine . Do it . " <p> Two seasons ago when Gibbs wanted to keep Kelvin Bryant as a third-down running back , Cooke okayed the move even though Bryant would be making $ 750,000 to touch the ball a couple dozen times the entire season . Likewise , last summer when Gibbs wanted to keep Gerald Riggs as a short-yardage runner , Cooke never mentioned Riggs 's $ 1 million salary . <p> " It just does n't come up , " Casserly said . " Mr. Cooke is aware of the money , but if you explain to him why you 're doing something , he usually understands . I do n't think people understand all that goes into this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the smallest stadium in the league and do n't have the suites to sell . People say , well , the stadium is always filled . Most of the stadiums in this league are filled on Sundays . Ours is filled with fewer seats . " <p> Cooke has been negotiating for years with District officials about building a 78,000-seat stadium adjacent to RFK Stadium . <p> Gibbs , named coach of the year last week by The Sporting News in a poll of NFL players , could become the first NFL coach to win three Super Bowls with three different quarterbacks ( Joe Theismann , Doug Williams and Rypien ) . He has won 115 regular season games , five division championships and been to the playoffs in seven of his 11 seasons . The Redskins have lost one home playoff game since he arrived . <p> He made his reputation by going to a Super Bowl in his second season as a head coach and by working 20-hour days and sleeping in his office . He clearly is an exceptional tactician , both in terms of putting together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's also at that point in his career , having had so much success , that he 's held in something approaching awe by his players . <p> " What you know around the Redskins is that when you go out for practice on Wednesday we 're going to have a game plan that gives you the best chance to succeed that week , " Rypien said . <p> Gibbs maintains a Tom Landry-like stoicism on the sideline , almost never smiling . Devoutly religious , he is , by his own admission , a dull public figure , and an unemotional speaker . Nor is he one for gimmicks . He has spoken often about coaches who asked players to win one for this cause or that sick fan or something , " and I 've found tricks do n't work . You ca n't fool an entire team . If you 've got something phony , they 're going to know it 's phony in about a minute . " <p> Instead , Gibbs uses the motivational tool he calls " logic , just logic . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for being loyal to his older players , although his cutting of stars Williams , Theismann and John Riggins was not done without some public bitterness and lasting scars . <p> Gibbs appreciates veterans such as Art Monk and Don Warren , among others , because they 're still productive and because he believes they set the highest standard possible . <p> He is flexible , and has changed practice schedules or team rules when players have asked . Yet he can also be tough . He was the first NFL coach ( and still one of the few ) to give up practice time so that players could lift weights , the theory being that a lot of offseason strength work is lost if the work is n't maintained during the season . <p> Under Gibbs , the season at Redskin Park essentially begins March 1 when players are required to begin their conditioning programs . The Redskins are the only team that does n't offer bonuses for attending offseason workouts , but it 's almost impossible to make the team without working hard in the offseason . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Art Monk around , " Gibbs said . " If a young player is smart , he looks around and says , ' Now , how do I stay here 12 years ? ' If he 's smart , he 'll look at the guys who 've been here that long and see what they do . " <p> Tight end Ron Middleton said he learned a lot about Gibbs in the spring of 1990 . That 's when Gibbs phoned to say the Redskins wanted to sign him as a Plan B free agent . The catch : Gibbs had already cut Middleton three times , the third at a time when Middleton 's wife had given birth to a premature son who was fighting for his life . Friends told Middleton he was crazy for going back . <p> " He was just so honest with me that it touched me , " Middleton said . " He left a message on my machine that said he did n't blame me if I did n't call back . When I talked to him , he apologized for cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would do that in the NFL ? " <p> Cooke said he has trusted Gibbs from the moment he first looked across at him in a suite at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York 11 years ago . He thought he saw a man " with as much intensity as I have . <p> " And I 'll tell you something else , " Cooke said . " He 's as pleasant a fellow as I have working for me . We 're not just partners , we 're friends . He 's one of my better friends . And there 's a trust there that has developed over 11 years . I would say it 's reciprocated . " <p> Casserly is the least known of the three . He 's meticulous , organized and opinionated . He brings an armload of data with him , whether it 's negotiating a contract , making a draft choice or discussing a trade . Cooke said he has no better employee in terms of preparation and thoroughness . Casserly succeeded Beathard , a legendary personnel man , in the spring of 1989 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signing or trading for 19 of the Redskins on this week 's 47-man roster for the big game in Minneapolis . <p> In another setting , Cooke , Gibbs and Casserly might not have three words to say to one another . They could hardly be more different : Cooke the billionaire industrialist , voracious reader and collector of antiques and fine wines ; Gibbs , who does n't read much outside of the Bible and the sports section , who recently fulfilled a dream by putting together a big-time stock car racing team ; and Casserly , who quit his job as a high school coach in Massachusetts to come to Redskin Park as an unpaid assistant to Allen . <p> Casserly lived at the Alexandria YMCA for a year before Allen gave him a salary , then slowly worked his way up the organizational ladder . He vacations at Disney World with his family and still spends three or four days a week on the road scouting college players . He does n't have Beathard 's reputation for making the flashy and complex trades , but inside Redskin Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and just as prepared . <p> There 's no working relationship in sports more strained than that of coach and general manager , and it 's clear that Casserly and Gibbs disagree on many things . " But we 've been honest with each other , " Gibbs said . " When we disagree we argue about it , and if we ca n't settle it we go to Mr. Cooke . There 's a lot of respect involved . " <p> Gibbs 's relationship with Beathard began to wear thin in the final years of Beathard 's tenure . Casserly says : " Of course there are things we disagree about . But what we 've set up here has worked for a long time . We all have a say in decisions , but the personnel department gets the players here , the coaches decide who makes the team . " <p> Yet at Redskin Park , amid the cramped working conditions and steel desks , they 've created something special . " It 's the finest organization in professional sports , " Cooke said immodestly . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply put are at the top of their professions . I would n't say I have absolute trust in them , but it 's pretty close . " <p> The finished product is not football 's most exciting team . The secrets they have they keep mostly to themselves . They 're not much for interviews . And they never give an opponent anything for the bulletin board . It 's impossible to understand why it all works , and indeed no one argues that luck plays a part . <p> Gibbs said the longer he has coached the more he has come to believe in a few unbending principles . <p> For one , he wants players who are tough and will play with pain . He talks with pride of seeing players lined up to get pain-killing injections during a victory at Dallas . <p> For another , he wants intelligence . A half-dozen Redskins have applied to law school , and one , cornerback Martin Mayhew , took night classes at Georgetown Law School this season . Safety Terry Hoage has a degree in genetics , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Redskins are in the Super Bowl because they 've planned well and worked hard , but they could n't have known how much Rypien would improve . They could n't have known the contribution they 'd get from rookie running back Ricky Ervins , available when they drafted in the third round , sharing time with Earnest Byner . They certainly could n't have known that a defense with five Plan B free agents in the starting lineup would allow the second-fewest points in the NFL . <p> " I think you can predict it , " Cooke said . " You get good people and you give them the things they need to succeed . That 's our formula , and the success here will continue long after I 'm gone . My son John and his son John will continue the tradition of the Redskins , and if they do n't , heaven help them because I 'll be watching from below or above , wherever I happen to be . "
