Section : HEARTBEAT The Healthy Heart Report <p> A new national strategy of increased physical activity can lead the way to curbing America 's high blood pressure epidemic . <p> In a culture of car phones and computerized coffee makers , where pizza makes house calls and fast food franchises penetrate every town , it 's no surprise that more than 60 million Americans have high blood pressure , and 2 million more develop the disorder each year . <p> " Hypertension in the United States is an epidemic , " says Dr. Paul K. Whelton , professor of epidemiology and medicine at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions in Baltimore . " History teaches us that a disease occurs in epidemic proportions only when large numbers of people are exposed to environmental factors that foster the illness . " For high blood pressure , he notes , these factors include physical inactivity , obesity , and excess salt and alcohol consumption . <p> High blood pressure is the top risk factor for stroke and a major contributor to heart disease and kidney failure , noted Whelton and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in October , detailing a national strategy to decrease the prevalence of hypertension in America . Issued on the 20th anniversary of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program  --  a government and private sector coalition of health organizations  --  the report is the first national recommendation of this type in any country . <p> " The complications caused by high blood pressure are insidious , progressive , and costly , " says Dr. Claude Lenfant , director of the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute ( NHLBI ) . " And they can begin before blood pressure rises above the normal range . So it is not enough to treat the condition . We need to help Americans avoid its development . " <p> To help prevent high blood pressure , the new report urges Americans to take four steps : Become physically active . Regularly perform some moderate-intensity , low-resistance , dynamic exercise , such as walking , cycling , dancing , swimming , or gardening . Control weight . The overweight have a two- to six-fold higher risk of developing high blood pressure than those of regular body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States can be attributed to this one health problem alone . Avoid excessive table salt intake . Consume no more than 6 grams daily . Avoid excessive alcohol consumption . Limit alcohol consumption to no more than two drinks daily . About 5-7 percent of hypertension in the United States can be attributed to consumption of three or more alcoholic drinks a day . <p> Becoming physically active can be central to making all these positive lifestyle changes , experts note , because physical activity can help people lose weight and reduce the stress that can contribute to excess drinking and eating . <p> High blood pressure is " a disease of civilization " that is a direct result of our sedentary lifestyle , notes Dr. Michael Horan , associate director for cardiology at NHLBI . In societies where people get a great deal of physical activity in their daily lives , he says , " you do n't see the prevalence of obesity , hypertension , or high cholesterol . " <p> The idea that inactivity is at the root of much ill health is relatively new . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was common to tell hypertensives not to exercise because activity elevates the blood pressure , " says Dr. Samuel M. Fox , professor of medicine and director of preventive cardiology at Georgetown University Medical Center . While systolic ( pumping ) blood pressure does rise during exercise , he notes , the long-term effect of aerobic exercise can be a small , but significant , reduction in overall blood pressure . <p> New studies show that regular aerobic exercise may help prevent the development of hypertension , keep those with borderline high blood pressure off medication and , possibly , reduce the hypertensive patient 's risk of death . <p> Exercise is not a panacea , Fox cautions , and should be part of a comprehensive program to lower elevated blood pressure that includes keeping weight down , eliminating cigarettes , and restricting consumption of fat , sodium , and alcohol . But properly supervised by a physician , Fox notes , " Exercise can help some hypertensives cut back or eliminate expensive and troublesome medication . I had one patient in his mid-40s who , over a year and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go completely off his beta blocker through a program of regular exercise . " <p> But it is essential that people over 45 and those under 45 with risk factors for heart disease  --  such as obesity or inactivity  --  consult a physician before beginning an exercise program because one of the main problems surrounding hypertension is that frequently there are no symptoms until it 's too late . <p> The first sign of trouble is often a heart attack or stroke , notes physician Kenneth Cooper , the man who helped launch America 's fitness revolution with his 1968 book Aerobics . To defend against this silent killer , Cooper first advises non-drug strategies including regular aerobic exercise , stress management , weight loss , and dietary controls such as reducing sodium intake , restricting alcohol , reducing saturated fat intake , and eating potassium-rich foods . Only if these approaches fail does Cooper encourage use of medication . But , he contends , " an awful lot of people are on medication who do n't need it . " <p> In his book , Overcoming Hypertension , Cooper writes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drug that will control or mask hypertension . Unfortunately , that 's the approach taken by many physicians with the result that , almost invariably , the patient builds up tolerance to the medication . When this happens , either the dose must be increased , the medication changed , or a combination of medications prescribed . A vicious , seemingly endless cycle may then arise , shifting the patient from medication , to tolerance , to more medication . " <p> Because drugs for high blood pressure can be costly and have significant side effects , Cooper recommends first adopting lifestyle changes that could help prevent or control hypertension without medication . Chief among these is exercise , he says , " since so many times , when people start to exercise , it prompts them to do other things that are good for them . For example , the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta reports that the best known way to break the cigarette habit permanently is to start an exercise program . " <p> Exercise can help combat high blood pressure in several ways , Cooper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown to decrease resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure by about 10 millimeters of mercury . Second , exercise often results in weight loss , which typically produces a decline in blood pressure . Third , aerobic exercise reduces stress , which also may help combat hypertension . <p> " The more physically fit you are , " Cooper says , " the less likely you are to suffer from hypertension . The more sedentary you are , the greater your risk of developing high blood pressure . Regular aerobic exercise , such as jogging , cycling , swimming , and vigorous walking , is one of the most effective non-drug medicines ' for those at risk for hypertension . " <p> Aerobic activity should be performed regularly  --  at least three times a week for 20 to 30 minutes per session  --  to have a beneficial impact on blood pressure . And some muscle-tensing activities , such as heavy weightlifting and highly resistant calisthenics like push-ups , may be dangerous for people with hypertension . Heavy weightlifting results in an exaggerated increase in blood pressure , notes Cooper , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with normal blood pressure alike . People who do lift heavy weights should have their blood pressure monitored frequently , he says . <p> Cooper also warns against vigorous aerobic exercise for people with extremely high blood pressure . " Certain people with severe hypertension should n't do any strenuous exercise unless their blood pressure can be controlled with drugs , " he says . " This is because athletic activity may trigger a serious health complication , like a stroke , for those whose blood pressure remains too high . " <p> Hypertensives whose blood pressure is greater than 175/110 should avoid vigorous exercise , he says , but could do easy walking or swimming with their physician 's guidance . Even at lower levels of hypertension , the decision regarding exercise should be made by a physician , says Cooper , who adds these guidelines : <p> Be sure to have a thorough physical exam before embarking on an exercise program . If hypertension is diagnosed , proceed only with the full knowledge and supervision of your physician . <p> If your blood pressure is 160/105 or higher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you on appropriate drug therapy . Your response to such therapy will determine the point at which you can embark on an exercise program . <p> If you are on drugs for hypertension when you begin this program , reduce the dosages of those drugs only with the permission of your physician . <p> Blood pressure readings may vary considerably during the day in response to such factors as caffeine , smoking , a full bladder , being cold , or even the stress of being in the doctor 's office . " So the key to diagnosing hypertension is your average blood pressure , which means the average of multiple readings taken over one to two months , " Cooper says . <p> He advises people with a genetic predisposition to high blood pressure to invest in a home monitor . People with risk factors for the disease , such as family history of hypertension , obesity , high stress , and being sedentary , should begin exercising regularly and eating wisely , he says , before hypertension strikes . <p> " There 's a danger that , as our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those at risk of hypertension will rise , " he warns . " We do n't just die anymore ; we kill ourselves . " <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The more physically fit you are , says father of aerobics Dr. Kenneth H.
