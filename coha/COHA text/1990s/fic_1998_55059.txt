Potrebbe gia l'uomo opporre contra me e dicere che non sapesse a cui fosse lo mio parlare in seconda persona ... questo dubbio io lo intendo solvere e dichiarre in questo libello ancora in parte piu dubbiosa . <p>  --  Dante Alighieri , Vita Nuova IN WHAT ONE MUST ASSUME was a waking dream , Francesco Bernardone of Assisi heard the image of Christ on a crucifix issue certain instructions : Francesco , riparami la chiesa , fix my church ... or words to that effect . But did it mean that particular building , with its leaking roof and cracked pavement , or the whole ecclesiastical institution ? Never mind ; you have to start somewhere . My name , by the way , is not Francesco , and the voice I heard said nothing about a church . <p> It may , of course , have been speaking to the wrong person in the wrong dream . Assuming it was a dream . It hardly matters what it was , waking or sleeping dream , passing reverie or idle thought , by which Ivo Sanginori sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against such intrusions and install himself in the literary tradition . It was a tradition of mirrors to begin with , one of suggestions and equivocations , indirections and false starts , and ironic poses ironically scrutinized  --  an accumulative series of what might be called spiritual acrostics  --  and this was the heritage in which he insisted on taking his place . Write my life , he said . restore my works . Whereupon he gave his name and departed . I say gave his name , but the fact is he only traced it in the air with his fingers . I-V-O , three sharp strokes and a circular one , was unmistakable ; S-A-N-G-I-N-O-R-I , if that 's what it was , wavered and seemed to drift away like smoke . Ivo Sanguinoso ? Not bloody likely . Let 's make it Sanginori and hope I got it right . <p> The Enciclopedia Italiana , alas , is no help at all . There 's obviously a lacuna ; such is the carelessness of its editors . " Sangiano " ( commune in Lombardy ) ; " San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ; " Sangineto " ( commune in Calabria ) ; " San Giorgio " ( hamlet in the commune of Sant'Ambrogio di Valpolicella ) ; " Sangiorgio , Abbondio " ( sculptor , 1798-1879 ) ; " Sangiovese " ( two varieties of wine , from Tuscany and the Romagna respectively ) ; " Sangro " ( river in central Italy ) .... Not even the most perfunctory entry for " Sanginori , Ivo , " none of the essential data such as birthplace , dates of birth and death , and in between the trajectory of a life . That means we 're on our own , Ivo and I. <p> How do you put together a new life ? You use what comes to hand from old ones . So for lack of anything to the contrary , and always subject to correction or amplification , let us postulate that Ivo Sanginori was born in a country house near the Umbrian town of Orvieto , on 19 March 1868 ( notice that the date adds up to 9 , an essential figure for new lives ) . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was a local winegrower ; anything else about him will have to be gleaned from his son 's writings , which we 'll get to in due course . About Ivo 's mother , however , there is a wealth of firsthand information . Donna Fausta was a large , handsome , practical woman , level-browed and sedate as Minerva or the goddess Roma . If she sometimes displayed an unexpected degree of snobbishness , she was down-to-earth in the things that mattered . She had an excellent business sense , no doubt better than her husband 's , and it was she who managed the vineyards , supervised the braccianti , or day-laborers , and kept the books . <p> In the fall of 1877 , the American novelist Henry James , thirty-four years old and already domiciled in England , alighted from the Florence-Rome express train , which had only recently begun to make stops at Orvieto , and viewed the horrid purple mountain from the apex of which this dark old Catholic city uplifts the glittering front of its cathedral . As he stood in the desolate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarred with outcrops of volcanic tufa , stretched away on the other side , did he notice a nine-year-old boy playing fanciful games with sticks and piles of pebbles  --  miniature imitations , perhaps , of the purple mountain looming above , and which he delighted in building up and knocking down ? Let us hope so . <p> There is a rustle in the bushes , a high-pitched laugh , and out pops a sallow little face with such fathomless eyes and high , broad cheekbones that one might expect pointed ears and goat 's hooves to follow . But no , the ears , though almost hidden by a tangled mop of hair , are rounded like anyone else 's , and the feet are the dirty bare feet of a peasant boy , son of one of the braccianti . Massimo Crescentelli , with his faunlike presence and stony Etruscan features , was to be Ivo 's companion in thought for many years to come , but for the moment he only blocked his view of the foreign gentleman , who , stooping down and fanning himself with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two urchins ( one wearing shoes and slightly better dressed than the other , but to the fastidious visitor from England indistinguishably sounding , as he himself might say , the picturesque note ) where he could hire a carriage to take him to the top of the mountain . But even before it was spoken , his question was superfluous , as out of nowhere a horde of drivers converged on him , all shouting at once . <p> While one carriage rattles away in triumph and the other drivers resentfully disperse , it is time to ask ourselves where all this is heading . ( Neither do the two boys have much idea where they 're heading as , clinging precariously to the rear of the carriage , they make faces at each other and mock the foreign gentleman 's dignity behind his back . ) Does Henry James 's arrival on the scene undermine or bolster the credibility of Ivo and his little friend ? Come to think of it , why should n't the two of them offer themselves as guides to the bemused tourist once they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , winding road takes almost an hour , and we can be sure that their fingers are cramped and sore by the time they reach the town . After dropping the traveler at the hotel in the piazza , the driver hurls imprecations and threatening gestures at the two stowaways , whom he has only just discovered . They return his insults ( Massimo 's vocabulary is the more colorful and spinto ) from a safe distance until he tires of the game and drives away , and presently the foreign gentleman emerges from the hotel without his suitcase and sets off walking at a brisk pace . Now is their chance , though they wait to see where he is going before they make their offer . <p> But surely an informed visitor from abroad does n't need the services of two ignorant and mercenary nine-year-olds . Henry James knows exactly what he wants to see . They are still following some ten paces behind when he reaches the cathedral , pauses to inspect the glittering mosaics and yellowed marble of the facade , then enters and turns immediately toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compendium of life , now and in the hereafter , opens before their eyes . Guardate su , ragazzi ... look upward , like the gentleman ! And they do , till their mouths drop open in astonishment and their necks ache . They see a man preaching to a crowd while a devil whispers in his ear , and they see the same false prophet ( though they have no way of identifying him as such ) being lifted into the air by an angel and unceremoniously dropped . They see a flock of flying demons shooting fire from their mouths and all sorts of people falling in a heap . They see two archangels blowing trumpets to awaken the dead , who emerge first as skeletons before assuming a new life in the flesh . They see a writhing mass of the damned being bitten and scratched and choked by ferocious demons , while other naked folk listen to a concert by angels playing harps and lutes . Ivo is by turns curious , excited , scared , exhilarated , but from the wary look in Massimo 's eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the musical angels , he is all too familiar with the horned and bat-winged demons , gray as tufa and with spooky genitals , that indeed he has seen them before in some earlier , even cruder guise . And still lower on the walls , like afterthoughts or hints of things to come , there are monochrome depictions of scenes from Dante Alighieri 's most famous book , but it is doubtful whether Ivo and his friend would have noticed these , or understood them if they had . <p> Henry James looks disappointed . I 'm disappointed myself : my idea that the boys might earn a couple of soldi apiece by playing Virgil to the great author as he visits a painted version of hell and advances within hailing distance of paradise has come to nothing . An inexplicable shyness has fallen on these little interlopers , and though they continue to dog the gentleman 's footsteps after he leaves the cathedral and takes a leisurely stroll through the town , they are afraid to approach him , afraid to speak . <p> Now , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel . Tomorrow he will catch the same train for Rome that brought him to Orvieto , an idea that never crossed the minds of his secret companions . To get home , where they should have been hours ago , they have had to wind their way down the conical mountain alone and on foot . With night coming on , they missed the turning that would have led to a shortcut , the medieval mule-track . Massimo cut his foot on a sharp rock and cried out in pain , and Ivo put his arm around him to help him hobble along . <p> It took hours to make the descent , but by the time they parted in the darkness of the plain , they knew they would be friends forever . Massimo , on reaching home , was screamed at by his mother and savagely mauled by his father ; Ivo was received with less drama perhaps , but the consequences were to be , if anything , more lasting . For now Donna Fausta , that sane and hearty businesswoman , turns out to be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a smattering of medical knowledge , forbidding him ever again to play with the children of the braccianti . For one thing , she said , those people led dirty , sinful lives ; for another they were prone to diphtheria and all kinds of other diseases . One was no doubt the result of the other . She was quite firm about this . <p> There are two possibilities : either Ivo minded his mother and snubbed Massimo ( negandogli lo suo dolcissimo salutare , to paraphrase the great poet ) whenever their paths happened to cross , or else despite all opposition they became inseparable for the next four years . It is the usual choice between idealism and practicality , or love and duty if you like ; there are passages in Ivo 's work that lend themselves equally to one interpretation or the other . What is indisputable is that Massimo Crescentelli died of diphtheria at the age of thirteen , just as Donna Fausta had predicted , or willed , that he should . <p> I see no point in searching out the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents sent him about this time , and have not the heart to describe his education at the hands of his priestly schoolmasters . Nor have I any intention of plotting the fever chart of his adolescent religiosity or revealing the circumstances in which he first made love to a woman . By the time we meet him again , he is a mature man of unspecified age who has already acquired that slightly clerical formality with which he accosts people in their dreams . He has published , at his own expense , a slim volume of anemic verses , alexandrines celebrating the eyebrows , bosoms , and pretty feet of a number of chosen women , hendecasyllables and hexameters exploring the bucolic charms of a landscape from which the harsh volcanic rock around Orvieto seems rigorously excluded . ( All copies of this book have mercifully disappeared . ) To exercise his critical faculties , he writes occasional articles for literary journals in Rome . He has a private income and plenty of time for casual love affairs . Donna Fausta , like ox-eyed Juno , or the nymph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nemi , has reproduced herself beside him as his bride . <p> For as long as he could remember , he had been planning a grandiose , universal poem , in terza rima , that would encompass the whole of experience in this life , and perhaps speculate on what lay beyond . It would be political as well , in the broad , philosophical sense of the word , while at the same time settling old personal scores . But every time he thought to embark on it , he ran into a massive roadblock  --  the purple mountain of his childhood , looming over everything and claiming it for its own . <p> It was not so much the mountain itself , less substantial than it appeared and with a tendency to fade in and out of his mind , but what it left behind , a redolence of earth and human bodies , a suffusion of golden light , and an aching , bittersweet longing so overpowering that he wondered if he was n't making it all up post hoc . Had he ever had , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascended the mountain to view the delights of paradise and the torments of the damned ? Or was this presence merely part of himself , a mute part , inert as a boundary stone , standing there on one bare foot and gazing at him with ageless eyes in which there was now a touch of fever , but from which all expression , or even the chance of evoking it , had faded ? For needless to say , there is no such thing as a male muse . It is an oxymoron at best , a contradiction in terms comparable to that chimera or stalking-horse of psychoanalysis , the Phallic Woman . <p> Ivo never had a clear picture of his first encounter with Maria Spina . She may have been pausing in a doorway , or leaning from an upstairs window , or carrying an earthenware jug from a fountain at the end of a street . A slip of a girl , she already dressed like an old woman in funereal black . What did he see in her ; what was the attraction ? He took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the lower orders , and though he may once have asked his mother why some children had shoes and others did n't , he could recall neither the occasion nor what her answer had been . And certainly the fearsome Franciscan virtues of Poverty , Obedience , and Chastity had not the slightest appeal for him . He was a proud and worldly rentier , adept at dodging any authority that might seek to impose itself on him , and  --  it goes without saying  --  unchaste . Nor was there reason to be otherwise . Yet here was this meek , downtrodden creature who now took up residence in his soul . It was as though she had wandered in from the wrong dream . <p> Maria Spina : let us draw up a little catalog of her qualities . Her piety , her sentimentality , her superstition , her poor health . Her lungs were not sound , and a childhood injury had left her permanently lame . In her weakness and vulnerability , she even aroused in Ivo a certain contempt . Her perennial look of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pathos irritated him extremely , as did her low tastes , her liking for wax flowers , painted seashells , plaster saints . She was what we would call functionally illiterate . Yet here she was what you will . <p> Let there be no misunderstanding : Maria Spina does not represent some impossible ideal of purity , abstract or otherwise . She can not be seen as an avatar of Dante 's Beatrice or Petrarch 's Laura , who after all were only avatars themselves . ( Anyway that function has already been usurped by Massimo Crescentelli , dying of diphtheria at thirteen . ) So where did she come from ? She can not be traced to Ivo 's shrewd , practical mother , nor to her avatar , his wife . She bears no resemblance to any of his countless mistresses , those lovelorn ladies who rarely managed to distract him from his poetic vocation  --  bereft virgins , bourgeois housewives , actresses in provincial touring companies , and bored women of the Roman aristocracy , all of whose limitations of thought and gesture were of quite another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at best , and now , with the advent of Maria Spina , it kept breaking out unexpectedly in canticles and lauds . He tried to curb this tendency , even if it meant doing damage to his inspiration , and indeed , he sometimes achieved better effects by overruling her . There was a literal-minded streak in her that he had to work hard to overcome . For instance , she was unable to accept , much less appreciate , the peculiar inversion of imagery that runs throughout his work . He speaks often of an ascent to hell , but whether there is a corresponding descent to paradise is less certain . Anyway , the plangency , to use the fashionable word , of these passages is lost in translation . <p> She kept leading him back to the purple mountain , up which he dutifully trudged at least nine times in her company . Childhood adventures  --  and these would include the cathedral at whose portal ( the building itself , with its mosaic facade , had almost dissolved , and all that remained were the marvelous frescoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massimo Crescentelli  --  had to be given their due , but still he was convinced there were other things to be conveyed in a universal poem . Le belle notizie , for instance , the glad tidings , by which he meant that ultimate sense of liberation and faith in the world that comes from creation well performed . Above all , he wanted clarity , directness , objectivity , all the things that were so difficult to negotiate with Maria Spina . Sarcasm and satire , of course , were beyond her . Humble creature though she was , she had her own stubborn and complicated little ideas , and there were even times when her slight , stooping figure , clothed in dismal black , seemed to stand between him and his inspiration , blocking his access . When this happened , there was nothing to do but lay down his pen . <p> Why did he not have recourse to the simple facts of his life and draw poetic sustenance from them ? Why are there no allusions in his poems to the house where he was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his myriad love affairs , his literary quarrels with contemporaries ? Contrary to my expectations , I find nothing in his work that can be interpreted as even remotely referring to his father , and we will never know whether he was a winegrower in Orvieto or not . Even his mother casts less of a shadow than you might think , and his wife casts none at all . For if Ivo Sanginori had learned anything in the course of his haunted existence , it was that all life is a repetition , a duplication , open or disguised , of something else , and that autobiographical significance , if and when it can be said to exist , is of less than secondary importance . <p> Meanwhile his grand universal poem was going nowhere . He was in a blind alley , and Maria Spina 's shadowy graces seemed powerless to lead him out . What finally came to his rescue were his dreams , in which , on an endless plain where there was no other life , no mountain or city or cathedral , nothing but scattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's injured foot in her hands and bring it to her lips . Awakening , he sat down immediately at his desk and wrote : <p> All'inizio del cammin di nostra vita ... <p> and everything after that was simply repetition and duplication . It was the opening line he had been searching for all his life , and Massimo had transmitted it to him with the blessings of Maria Spina . He wrote and wrote , and finally , after one hundred luminous cantos , his account with her was closed . It was his triumph , his Divina Commedia , his Canzoniere . <p> Now his work is finished , or as much of it as will ever be , and many possible deaths lie open to Ivo Sanginori  --  if not Italy 's greatest poet , at least her most elusive and evanescent one . Suicide , a duel , a railway crash , the kick of a horse , a tavern brawl , the vicissitudes of war , any number of illnesses . The matter is of scant importance and can safely be left to future editors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are back in that tumbledown church of San Damiano , just outside Assisi , contemplating the sad state of its interior , the dripping ceiling , the grass growing between the cracks in the pavement , and listening to pleas for renovation from the figure on the cross . The wrong dream , again . <p> Donna Fausta , after a period of decent mourning , set to work with a vengeance . As Ivo 's widow and executrix , she found herself catapulted into the illustrious company of Flaubert 's niece Caroline Commanville , of Elisabeth Forster-Nietzsche , of Lady Isabel Burton . In this capacity she was able to alter or burn manuscripts , suppress correspondence , challenge attributions , deny translation rights , and in general avenge all the real or fancied slights to her person and sex implicit in his work , while at the same time going through the motions of guarding the sacred flame . In other words , she could bask in the glow of that flame while making a strenuous effort to put it out . But let us not be too hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ivo 's life , she was the one outsider . And , like him , she is only my invention . <p> And Maria Spina  --  whose invention is she ? That 's not the way Ivo would have put it . Instead it had often occurred to him that she , his muse , had chosen him as her spokesman , as a means of expressing her infatuation with Massimo Crescentelli . Massimo , for his part , had needed Maria Spina not only to serve as an intermediary but even to act in his stead . Ivo was well aware of their complicity , and sometimes wondered if he had n't been unfairly used . Quei due malandrini , as he remarked to himself with a fond , grim smile . Those two scamps . <p> The reverse , of course , could be argued as well : that he , Ivo , had created Maria Spina in order to open a channel to Massimo Crescentelli . The muse , after all , does not create the poet . If , as some think , man creates God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he finds most serviceable . But once he has created her , she , like God , embarks on an existence of her own . Ivo Sanginori is dead , and Maria Spina lives on . <p> Henry James , who all this time has been standing patiently by , is hereby released and had better hurry if he is not to miss his train . In his written account of his visit to Orvieto , he quite forgot to mention the two urchins who shadowed him throughout , but it may well be that he never saw them . Incidentally , he found Luca Signorelli 's theological frescoes , as he calls them , very striking and interesting , though I have seen compositions of this general order that appealed to me more . <p> <p> By JOHN SHEPLEY <p>
