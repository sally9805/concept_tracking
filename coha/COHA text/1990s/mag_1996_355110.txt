JIM CLARK Digital Entrepreneur <P> The world changed on Aug. 9 , 1995 , and not just because Jerry Garcia died . That was also the day the initial public stock offering for Netscape Communications , a company that had yet to turn a profit , instantly garnered an astonishing $2 billion on the strength of one idea . The idea was the World Wide Web , and its gatekeeper , for the foreseeable future , is Jim Clark . <P> Conquering the light-speed computer industry means leaping ahead one cognitive generation and landing in the right place . Few entrepreneurs turn this trick even once ; at 52 , Clark has done it twice . In the early ' 80s , as the industry 's initial generation of mainframes ( see IBM ) gave way to a second generation of desktop PCs ( see Apple , Microsoft ) , Clark saw a way to put that data-crunching power to work visualizing information ranging from aircraft fluid dynamics to rampaging velociraptors , then founded the company that made it happen . Fourteen years , 7,200 employees and $2.2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own lucrative roost . <P> Clark , however , moved on . By 1994 the desktop generation was yielding to the networked , interactive generation . But while his peers were debating how to build the Infobahn , Clark decided it already existed . He 'd met Marc Andreessen , who as an undergraduate programmer had helped create the then obscure browsing software Mosaic , which made it easy to navigate the World Wide Web . Navigating the infant Web , which transforms the Internet 's isolated , text-based sites into one vast , hyperlinked , multimedia-capable network , got Clark thinking  --  and acting . He and Andreessen founded Mosaic Communications ( soon renamed Netscape ) and built a business around an improved Web browser . The result was one of history 's headiest corporate ascents , as the ubiquitous Netscape Navigator browser helped spawn the world 's startling online stampede . " The Internet was the information highway everyone was looking for , " says Clark . " They just had n't recognized it . " <P> Clark and Andreessen did , and today they find themselves riding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cutting deals with everyone from telephone companies to Hollywood . Virtually the entire data-intensive world  --  which is to say , virtually the entire world  --  has concluded that the Web is the future of communications , and is now retooling to stay in lockstep with Netscape ( and vice versa : Netscape perpetually updates its browser to accommodate new Web applications ) . " The list of businesses being transformed , " says Clark , includes " broadcasting , publishing , software , finance , shopping , entertainment services , consumer electronics ... It 's a massive , massive change . We just happened to see it first and set the commercial agenda . " <P> And to the agenda setters belong the spoils . His peers were skeptical when Jim Clark decided to colonize the Web . Well , today Netscape 's value has jumped to $5 billion , Clark 's own net worth stands at $1.3 billion , and he escapes often to enjoy the last laugh while sailing to sun-drenched paradises like Tahiti . He has earned the lush life twice over , even though others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have discovered the New World , but it was Isabella and Ferdinand who persuaded the royal court to put up the money . <P> CALVIN KLEIN Fashion Entrepreneur
