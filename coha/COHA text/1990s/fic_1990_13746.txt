There is a kind of grace to her movements as she alternately moves to the stove where she heats the tortillas on the comal , then back to the board again . LUPE and ROSARIO are seated next to each other at the kitchen table , engrossed in the novela . For a few moments all that is heard are the muted voices of the novela and the steady beat of the rolling pin . HORTENSIA She can go to hell as far as I 'm concern . ROSARIO Who , Hortensia ?

It 's coming closer closer closer ( To Sister Genevieve . ) Move ' ster ! Will you move ? Please move . Whew ! She moved jus ' in time . I don ' think Jessie wooda done it though . He 's too chicken . ( LUPE steps back from the mirror . ) I think there 's something wrong with me . I look at other kids ' faces .

It is a humid evening . HORTENSIA wears a light robe . HORTENSIA For weeks now , I walk around the house and hold my breath . Conrado is the only name on Manuel 's lips . He don ' talk about not'ing else . ROSARIO Qu dice , Hortensia ? HORTENSIA Estupideces . Half the time , I ca n't understand him . I see him sitting on the toilet , crying .

( Pause . ) Ahora , tengo mi casita , mi jardn , my kids are grown . What more do I need ? HORTENSIA I need more , Chayo . ( She gets up with the basket of clothes , goes back into the house .

His plumas bien planchadas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sharp like swords y tan perfumado , you could smell him before you saw him . I remember how when Conrado touched me jus ' to grab my hand no ms , and los vellitos on my arm would stand straight up . ( Pause . ) I 've never felt that with Manuel .

( She takes HORTENSIA 's face and turns it to her . ) Grab his face and make him see you . It 's not that men do n't love us . They just do n't stop to see us . HORTENSIA Why do n't they ? ROSARIO They do n't have to . Us women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighs for no reason , we already know the reason . We watch their faces y sabemos cuando se vuelven mscaras . What they hide from us , we smell on their clothes and touch in our sleep . We know better than them what they feel and that 's enough to make us believe it 's love . That 's a marriage . HORTENSIA Pues para m , ya no . It 's not a marriage for me . ( MANUEL can be seen coming up the porch steps . ) ROSARIO All viene . MANUEL ( MANUEL carries a caged canary . He sets it on the porch , removes his jacket . He wears a sleeveless undershirt . He sits and stares at the canary . ) Lupita 's lying to me . I know it .

( MANUEL walks past her , stands with his back to her . ) Nothing 's changed , has it ? I look at your back and it tells me nothing 's changed . A back does n't cry , ni tiene sonrisa , ni sabe gemir , gritar . But this is what I get to look at day in and day out . MANUEL Everywhere I go , everybody sees it . The girls , they see it . They 're laughing at me all the time . The people I work with , the patrn he sees it . He 's laughing , too .

LETICIA Let me see your eye . HORTENSIA No me toques . ' Stoy sucia . ( LETICIA gets a washcloth , puts it to her mother 's bruise . She resists . ) LETICIA C'm on , Mam . Now , hold it there .

( LETICIA sits on the edge of the tub and watches her mother and sister . The lights gradually fade to black. ) @x Sunset . ROSARIO sits on the porch . She fans herself . LUPE sits on the step below her . LETICIA lies on top of the bed reading a book , radio next to her . " Evil Ways " by Santana plays in the background . LUPE Papi keeps talking to himself all the time . Maybe he 's a saint . ROSARIO Tu pap no es un santo , m'ija . LUPE He could be . He suffers inside like the saints .

But your papi wan 's to suffer . LUPE He does n't . He has something inside that hurts him . ROSARIO What ? LUPE I du n no . LETICIA ( From the bedroom . ) Lupe ! LUPE What ! LETICIA Are you gon na do my toenails ? p. 51 LUPE Yeah . ( MANUEL enters the kitchen from upstage center , moving his lips , talking silently to himself . An orange color washes over the scene . ROSARIO looks into the horizon ) . ROSARIO Mira , ya se pone el sol . ( They all observe the sunset for a moment . ) This is the best time of all the day . Ves las sombras ? LUPE It 's so clear . ROSARIO En esta hora , just before the sun sets , you see the shadows more clear than anytime of the day . ( The sunset colors deepen , then fade as the sun descends into the horizon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for her father to sit . ROSARIO exits . LUPE sits at his feet , rubs some dirt off his shoe . ) MANUEL When my compadre , Conrado , was a little boy , he used to shine shoes for a living . He was never ashamed of it because , like he said , it was about making a buck anyway you could . He constructed the little shoe shine box with his own hands . I watched him do it . He sawed six perfectly even rectangles of wood and hammered them together . He made the top piece so it could flip open and shut . Like this . ( He demonstrates . ) And then he sanded it con una piedra . He painted the box black because most of the shoes he shined were black , he said , and that way the box would never look dirty . But the Tucson streets were very dirty in those days and the polvo would seep into the cracks of the box anyway . ( Pause . ) You do n't know him , Lupita , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use to live here near us . But then , he went back to Arizona to make it big . p. 52 LETICIA Lupe ! LUPE Yeah ! ( Standing . ) I 'm coming . ( LUPE goes to the bedroom . Distraught , MANUEL exits upstage , talking to himself . LUPE gets a bottle of nail polish , sits by the foot of the bed and starts applying polish to LETICIA 's toenails . LETICIA keeps reading . LUPE singing along with the radio . ) " Oh you 've got to change your evil ways , baby " ( The music fades . ) What name did you choose for your confirmation , Lettie ? LETICIA Cecilia . LUPE Why Cecilia ? Saint Cecilia was burned at the stake . LETICIA I liked the name . LUPE I was thinking of Magdalena for me Naw , cuz then people call you , Maggie . That 's Maggie O'Connel 's name . I ca n't stand her . LETICIA They could call you Lena . Anyway , nobody calls anybody by their confirmation name . It 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story about her . LETICIA Who ? LUPE Mary Magdalene . ( She rises , begins to dramatize the story . ) I loved how she jus ' walked right through all those phony baloney pharisees , right up to the face of Jesus . An ' there they were all looking down their noses at her like she was not'ing but a t sabes , a fallen woman . p. 53 LETICIA Well , she was a prostitute . LUPE She does n't look to the right or to the left , jus ' keeps staring straight ahead . The pharisees try to stop her , but Jesus tells them , " Let her come forward . " ( Returns to the toes . ) LETICIA Make sure you get it all the way down to the cuticle . LUPE I am . ( She paints one toe , then returns to the story of Magdalene . ) So the crowd opens up and makes a path for her . And then she kneels down in front of him an ' jus ' starts crying and crying for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet of Jesus . ) An ' y'see his feet are dusty from all those long walks in the desert She 's crying up a storm , it 's coming down in buckets all over Jesus ' feet ( Sob , sob , sob . ) LETICIA Are you finished ? LUPE In a minute . But suddenly the tears become like bathwater , real soft an ' warm an ' soothing-like . She 's got this hair , y'see , this long beautiful dark hair , an ' it 's so thick she can make a towel out of it . It 's so soft , it 's almost like velvet as she spreads it all over Jesus ' feet . ( She pours her hair over Jesus ' imaginary feet , then returns to LETICIA 's toes. ) p. 54 LETICIA Blow on ' em a little so they can dry faster , will you ? ( She does , then goes over to LETICIA . ) LUPE Can you imagine what it musta felt like to have this woman with such beautiful hair wiping it on you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) It 's jus ' too much to think about . And then Jesus says ( Pulling up LETICIA as " Magdalene . " ) " Rise woman and go and sin no more . " ( After a beat . ) Now that 's what I call forgiveness . That 's relief . MANUEL ( Offstage . ) Lupita ! Lupe ! HORTENSIA Lupe ! Tu pap te ' st llamando ! LUPE ( Putting the polish away . ) God , I 'm everybody 's slave around here . ( LUPE exits .

He drinks from a bottle of tequila . It is dusk . MANUEL I am a lonely man . I bring the bottle to my lips and feel the tequila pour down behind my tongue , remojando the back of my throat . Corre down la espina , until it hits my belly and burns como madre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , contento satisfecho . ( Pause . ) I look across the table and my compadre 's there y me siento bien . All I got ta do is sit in my own skin in the chair . ( Rises , goes into the kitchen , sits at the table . ) But he was leaving . I could smell it coming . I tried to make him stay . How did I let myself disappear like that ? I became nothing , a ghost . I asked him , " You want her , compa ? " He said , " Yes . " And I told him , " What 's mine is yours , compadre . Take her . " ( Rises , walks to the upstage wall . ) I floated into the room with him . In my mind , I was him And then , I was her , too . In my mind , I imagined their pleasure and I turned to nothing .

And it 's gon na to be like the old times and you 're not going to mess it up again . ( He stuffs the letter he has written into an envelope and seals it . He puts both letters into his pocket and exits . HORTENSIA watches him . After a beat , she sits , drops her face into her hands . Fade out. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FOUR LUPE is on the porch , shining MANUEL 's shoes . ROSARIO approaches , sits on the step . ROSARIO Tu papi 's getting all spruced up , eh ? LUPE Really . ROSARIO Dme uno . Yo te ayudo . LUPE Thanks , ta . ( She hands her a shoe to polish . ) ROSARIO He 's going out ? LUPE Uh-huh . ROSARIO Adnde ? LUPE To see that man . ROSARIO Who ? LUPE Conrado . ROSARIO How do you know ? LUPE I heard Papi telling Mami . She 's getting his clothes ready . She 's been singing all day , so she wo n't say nothing mean to him . ROSARIO She 's singing ? LUPE She 's mad inside , so she sings . That way only nice things come out of her mouth . ROSARIO Tu mam es una buena mujer. p. 62 LUPE I know . ( HORTENSIA enters the kitchen singing to herself , with underlying irritation . She puts a pair of MANUEL 's dress pants and a suit coat over the back of a chair . Upstage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt . ) MANUEL ( Offstage . ) Lupe ! LUPE ! All voy ! ( ROSARIO and LUPE rise , go into the kitchen . ) ROSARIO If they di'nt take the license from me , we could all go out and paint the town ourselves tonight . LUPE In that car ! Forget it , ta ! It 's got fins sharp enough to kill somebody . ROSARIO Pues , we got protection then . ( LUPE exits with the shoes . ROSARIO pours herself a cup of coffee and sits at the table . ) ROSARIO Conrado 's back ? HORTENSIA S. I do n't know what it is It 's like he wants to jump right into the heart of the herida and bury himself in there . I 'm his wife , but I 'm not goin ' to jump in there with him . ( MANUEL enters in his underwear , moving his lips , talking to himself silently . He wears a hat and holds his shoes and two ties . HORTENSIA hands him the shirt and he puts it on . They watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pants , examining the creases . He licks his fingers and runs them down the edge of a crease . He sits down , then stands up , checking the crease again. ) p. 63 MANUEL The crease does n't stay in them . ( He looks distraught . He holds up the two ties . ) La azul or the yellow one ? HORTENSIA La azul . ( MANUEL chooses the yellow one instead , stuffing the blue one into his pant pocket . He sits down and puts on his shoes with a shoehorn . The women continue watching him dress , their eyes never leaving him . ) ROSARIO Sometimes a man thinks of another man before he thinks of anybody else . He don ' think about his woman ni su madre ni los children , jus ' what he gots in his head about that man . He closes his eyes and dreams , " If I could get inside that man 's skin , then I 'd really be somebody ! " But when he opens his eyes and sees that he 's as empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fists and knocks down whatever stands in his way . ( He stands , buttons his coat . He looks at HORTENSIA . ) HORTENSIA If you go , Manuel , you wo n't find me here when you get back . I do n't know where you 'll find me , but I wo n't be here . MANUEL ( Starting for the door . ) Fine . HORTENSIA I 'll take the girls , Manuel . You 'll have a empty house to come home to . No ' stoy jugando . The minute you walk out that door ( He turns , then slowly approaches her . He bends and kisses her cheek , begins to exit . ) No puedo aguantarlo . No puedo . ( He stops in the doorway , turns. ) p. 64 MANUEL You 'll do as I say . Things will get better now . You 'll see . ( He dips his hat slightly over one eye and runs his fingers over the rim of it . He imagines himself in Conrado 's image , muy suave . ) Adis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) HORTENSIA ( Still staring at the door . ) I don ' wan ' Lupita here when Manuel comes home tonight . ROSARIO S. hermana . I 'll take her . ( LUPE enters upstage . ROSARIO looks at her . The tension frightens her . ) LUPE Ta ? HORTENSIA ( Brusquely . ) You 're goin ' to go with your ta tonight , m'ija . LUPE But ( HORTENSIA does n't look at her . ) HORTENSIA Lettie will bring your pijamas later .

( They go to the door . ) HORTENSIA Good night . p. 65 LUPE Mami ? ( HORTENSIA goes to her , kisses LUPE . ) HORTENSIA Nos vemos por la maana , m'ija muy tempranito . ( They exit . After a few moments , HORTENSIA goes out onto the porch , lights a cigarette , waits. ) p. 66 Act 2 , Scene 5 SCENE FIVE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still waits on the porch . LETICIA enters wearing a miniskirt and boots . LETICIA does n't notice her until HORTENSIA speaks . HORTENSIA It 's two o'clock in the morning . ( She stops . ) LETICIA I know . ( LETICIA goes into the kitchen . HORTENSIA follows her . ) HORTENSIA Crees que eres mayor ya ? LETICIA No . HORTENSIA Eres hombre , entonces . ( LETICIA sits . ) Tha 's what you want , is n't it ? To be free like a man . LETICIA That would n't be so bad . HORTENSIA ( Sitting . ) Pues , no naciste varn . If God had wanted you to be a man , he would of given you somet'ing between your legs . LETICIA I have something between my legs . HORTENSIA But you 're not a woman yet . In this house you 're not a woman , you 're my daughter a daughter I ca n't control . I know what you 're feeling and I ca n't stop you . You walk in that door and I can smell the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong with that ? HORTENSIA I don ' know what to tell you no more . Maybe there 's nothing wrong with that . I marry un hombre tranquilo . A good man . And I watch his back bend , his belly blow up with beer and I see my daughter grow to look at him con desprecio and contempt . LETICIA It 's not contempt , Mam . It 's pity . HORTENSIA That 's worse LETICIA ( After a pause . ) Do you love him ? HORTENSIA Maybe I do n't love him . To be with a man so long , day in and day out , it 's hard to know . Your head is on the pillow next to his . You feel his body , his weight , su aliento . I could know tu padre 's breathing anywhere porque lo oigo hasta en mis sueos . Entra en el alma cuando uno duerme Funny , when a man is asleep , tha 's when you really get to know him . You see the child 's look on his face , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In his half-dream , tiene la voz de un nio . But your husband really is n't your child . He di'nt come from your body . Y no matter cuntas veces le das el pecho , tu marido no es tu hijo . Your blood never mixes . He stays a stranger in his own home . LETICIA Do they ever really grow up , Mam ? p. 68 HORTENSIA I do n't think so . Maybe for you it 'll be different . ( There is a pause . LETICIA goes upstage , stands with her back to HORTENSIA . ) LETICIA I thought of you tonight . I thought of no longer being your daughter , that what I was gon na do would turn you away from me . HORTENSIA I don ' wan na know . LETICIA There they were , the Raza gods with their legs spread , popping beers , talking revolucin and those things , each with its own life , its own personality and I wanted to taste them all . Each and every fruta . " Una joya , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I opened my legs to one of them , Mam . The way a person opens her arms to take the whole world in , I opened my legs . HORTENSIA Is that what you call love ? LETICIA ( LETICIA turns to her . ) It 's not about love . It 's power . Power we get to hold and caress and protect . Power they drop into our hands , so fragile , the slightest pressure makes them weak with pain . HORTENSIA Why , m'ija ? Why you give your virginidad away for not'ing . LETICIA I was tired of carrying it around that weight of being a woman with a prize . Walking around with that special secret , that valuable commodity , waiting for some lucky guy to put his name on it . I wanted it to be worthless , Mam . Do n't you see ? Not for me to be worthless , but to know that my worth had nothing to do with it . ( Pause. ) p. 69 HORTENSIA You protect yourself , hija ? ( HORTENSIA goes to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( They embrace . HORTENSIA ' sface over LETICIA 's shoulder holds an expression of loss . After a beat , LETICIA exits upstage . HORTENSIA watches her . Moments later , CONRADO appears in the garden . He walks up the porch steps . He is well-dressed in a suit and wears a hat , dipped over one eye . He removes the hat , combs his hair with his fingers , replaces the hat . The lighting shifts to a surreal quality . Facing upstage , HORTENSIA removes her bathrobe , she wears a dark evening dress . She turns to CONRADO . ) HORTENSIA Where 's Manuel ? CONRADO He 's not here yet ? HORTENSIA No . ( He enters the kitchen . ) CONRADO Te ves igual . HORTENSIA After thirteen years ? CONRADO You look the same . HORTENSIA And you ? Are you the same ? CONRADO Pues , dime . Am I ? HORTENSIA You 've changed . CONRADO I 'm older . ( He laughs . They both sit. ) p. 70 HORTENSIA ( After a beat . ) Why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pause . ) He wrote me . HORTENSIA He told you ? HORTENSIA S. CONRADO He said you wanted me to come back . HORTENSIA And you believe that ? CONRADO No s . ( Pause . ) I 'm broke . HORTENSIA That 's why you came back ? CONRADO Pues HORTENSIA ( Smiling . ) So , you did n't make it big ? CONRADO No , ' mana . ( They both laugh . ) HORTENSIA So , here you are . ( Pause . ) CONRADO You remember one morning , I was standing on a street corner . It was First and Figueroa . I was with a woman , una gera , muy alta . I was talking to her when I heard the streetcar pass behind me . I turned around and I saw you looking at me through the window . The sun was just coming up into your eyes . And I turned to la gera and I kissed her on the mouth . p. 71 HORTENSIA I remember . CONRADO I did that to let you go so that you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , you married Manuel . He never knew what he had . HORTENSIA He 's been good to me . CONRADO I used to watch Riguito and Leticia circling around you in the kitchen , two little satellites in your orbit . I watched the way you moved inside your apron . I wanted you , Tencha . HORTENSIA No me digas ms . ( Stands , tango rises softly in background . ) When we first met , you and Manuel and me we had a good time , the three of us . He was the one I was with , but I was proud of you both , tan guapos en sus uniformes . Manuel danced a few numbers with me and then he 'd say , " This one 's for you , ' mano . Dance with Tencha . " ( CONRADO walks up to HORTENSIA . They dance . MANUEL appears in back . He stands in the dark , watching . CONRADO dips HORTENSIA and is about to kiss her . She turns her face away . They stop , hold their dancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( HORTENSIA backs away . CONRADO removes his hat . ) MANUEL ( To CONRADO . ) You never have enough . What I gave you was never enough . p. 72 CONRADO Nothing happened . MANUEL There she is waiting for you , compadre . Is n't that what I said ? I 'll give you the shirt off my back . You want my shirt ? ( MANUEL starts unbuttoning his shirt . ) CONRADO Stop it , compa . MANUEL You want my hat ? ( He shoves CONRADO into a chair and sticks his hat on CONRADO 's head . ) How about la waifa ! ( He grabs HORTENSIA and throws her onto CONRADO ' s lap . She crawls from his lap , away from the men . ) After you left her like a rag in the bed , how could I go to her ? Wipe up the little that was left of her . She walked around the house like she was something special , like she got a piece of you . ( He grabs CONRADO by the balls , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels ? To have your own wife holding something inside her that 's not yours . She made me feel like I was nothing . ( Turning to him . ) I loved you , man . I gave you my woman . But that meant nothing to you . You just went and left . I gave you my fucking wife , cabrn . I gave you my woman . What does that make me ? ( Pause . ) And all these years she looks at me like she knows something I do n't know , like she 's got something I do n't got . p. 73 HORTENSIA Manuel , you ca n't blame me . You were there that night . I heard you coming in . You were laughing and crying . Conrado was leaving . The whole house suddenly goes quiet y veo esta sombra in our room . ( CONRADO approaches HORTENSIA from behind . ) You stand there in the dark sin decir nada , jus ' staring at me . You come and lay down next to me . ( CONRADO puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) You put your hand around my waist and your touch is different . You speak CONRADO Hortensia . HORTENSIA And it 's not your voice . I tell you que te vayas , tha ' we ca n't do what you 're thinking Y me respondes CONRADO No te apures . Manuel knows . This is what he wants . HORTENSIA And I close my eyes y me entras and nothing 's the same after that . ( After a beat . ) Leave us alone now , compadre . ( CONRADO hesitates , looking at them for a moment . Then he grabs his hat and exits . There is a long pause . HORTENSIA does not remove her eyes from MANUEL . She reaches out her arms to him . He turns his face away . She recoils , bringing her arms back into her chest . She exits . MANUEL sits in a stupor . He slowly rises , takes out a fresh fifth of tequila and a bottle of pills . He swallows half the pills , washing them down with the tequila . He puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( He goes toward the bedroom . ) She 's waiting for me ( Enters the bedroom . He becomes frightened , looking for her inside the bedding . ) Lupe ? Lupita ? ( He rushes back into the kitchen . ) She 's gone. ! M'iji-i-i-ta ! ( He falls onto the chair , crying . It 's the labored sobbing of a man unable to reach the core of his despair . ) She took everything from me . ( He weeps until he is empty of tears . Moments later , his face hardened , impassive , MANUEL grabs the bottle of tequila and goes out onto the porch . The sun is beginning to rise . He sits , a silhouette against the dawn 's light . He swallows the remainder of the pills and raises the bottle to his lips . He drinks it down , his head thrown back . Black out . In the dark , the sound of his body hitting the floor . Moments later , the lights rise to reveal MANUEL in a heap on the floor . HORTENSIA enters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest . She looks up in horror . Fade out. ) p. 75 Act 2 , Scene 6 SCENE SIX The day of MANUEL 's funeral . The WOMEN and DAUGHTERS enter ritualistically in single file . They wear black . ROSARIO sits , a black rebozo on her lap . HORTENSIA holds two black dresses . LETICIA carries a suitcase . She sets it down . LUPE and LETICIA stand upstage in their slips . ) ROSARIO Bueno somos puras hembras now . A house full of women , no ms . ( They look at one another , as if noticing for the first time . ) HORTENSIA ( After a pause. ) ndale , m'ijas . You better get dressed . Your brother will be here para llevarnos purty soon . ( HORTENSIA hands LETICIA a dress . ) Toma . ( She hands LUPE a dress . They put them on . HORTENSIA zipping up LETICIA 's dress . ) Despus de tantos aos , es difcil decir , " He dug his own grave , let him lie in it . " ( Zipping up LUPE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let go your child 's hand and they go off to meet la Muerte in the street , es tu culpa ? ? O es el destino ? ( CONRADO appears at the door . He holds a note in his hand . He removes his hat , combs his hair back with his fingers . Knocks waits. ) p. 76 ROSARIO Es l . ( HORTENSIA goes to the door with the suitcase . ) CONRADO ( Referring to the note . ) You wanted me to get his things ? HORTENSIA Aqu ' st su ropa . ( She hands him the suitcase . ) CONRADO What should I do with them ? HORTENSIA Wear them . Burn them . ( CONRADO exits . HORTENSIA comes back inside . Sounds of car pulling up . ) ROSARIO Ya es hora . Ha llegado Rigo . ( They all begin to file out , ROSARIO stops . ) Lupita , cover up el espejo .

She spies MANUEL 's hat on a chair . She picks it up , fingers its rim , pauses again . She goes into the bathroom , approaches the mirror , still holding the hat . After a beat . ) I 've decided my confirmation name will be Frances ' cuz that 's what Frances Pacheco 's name is and I wan na be in her body . When she sits , she does n't hold her knees together like my mom and the nuns are always telling me to . She jus ' lets them fly an ' fall wherever they want real natural-like like they was wings instead of knees . ( Pause . ) An ' she 's got a laugh a laugh that seems to come from way deep inside herself , from the bottom of her heart or somet'ing . ( Fingering the hat . ) If I could I 'd like to jus ' unzip her chest and climb right inside there , next to her heart , to feel everyt'ing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Pause . ) It 's okay if she does n't feel the same way it 's my secret . p. 77 HORTENSIA ( Offstage . ) Lupe ! LUPE Ya voy .
