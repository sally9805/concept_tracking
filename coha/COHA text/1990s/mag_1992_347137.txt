Despite questions of the motivation behind them , the attacks by the President and the Vice President on the moral content of television entertainment have found an echo in the chambers of the American soul . Many who reject the messengers still accept the message . They do not like the moral tone of American TV . In our society only the human family surpasses television in its capacity to communicate values , provide role models , form consciences and motivate human behavior . Few educators , church leaders or politicians possess the moral influence of those who create the nation 's entertainment . <P> Every good story will not only captivate its viewers but also give them some insight into what it means to be a human being . By so doing , it can help them grow into the deeply centered , sovereignly free , joyously loving human beings God made them to be . Meaning , freedom and love  --  the supreme human values . And this is the kind of human enrichment the American viewing public has a right to expect from those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of entertainment or enrichment . These are complementary concerns and presuppose each other . The story that entertains without enriching is superficial and escapist . The story that enriches without entertaining is simply dull . The story that does both is a delight . <P> Is that what the American viewing public is getting ? Perhaps 10% of prime- time network programming is a happy combination of entertainment and enrichment . I think immediately of dramas like I 'll Fly Away and Life Goes On or comedies like Brooklyn Bridge and The Wonder Years . There used to be television movies rich in human values , but they have now become an endangered species . Sleaze and mayhem . Murder off the front page . The woman in jeopardy . Is there too much sex on American TV ? Not necessarily . Sex is a beautiful , even holy , part of human life , a unique way for husband and wife to express their love . No doubt there is too much dishonest sex on TV . How often do we see the aching emptiness , the joyless despair that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too much violence . It desensitizes its viewers to the horrors of actual violence and implies that it is an effective way to resolve conflict . I seldom see the dehumanization that violence produces , not only in its victims , but also in its perpetrators . And I never see the nonviolent alternative  --  the way of dialogue and love  --  explored . Jesus has much to teach us here . So do Gandhi and Martin Luther King . Ninety-four percent of the American people believe in God ; 41% go to church on any given Sunday . But you 'd never know it by watching American TV . We seldom see TV characters reach for God or fight with Him , despite the theatricality latent in their doing so . Why is that ? I find television too much concerned with what people have and too little concerned with who they are , very concerned with taking care of No. 1 and not at all concerned with sharing themselves with other people . All too often it tells us the half truth we want to hear rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
