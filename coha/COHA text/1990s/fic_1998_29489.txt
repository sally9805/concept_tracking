Chapter One Miracles Who am I ? And how , I wonder , will this story end ? The sun has come up and I am sitting by a window that is foggy with the breath of a life gone by . I 'm a sight this morning : two shirts , heavy pants , a scarf wrapped twice around my neck and tucked into a thick sweater knitted by my daughter thirty birthdays ago . The thermostat in my room is set as high as it will go , and a smaller space heater sits directly behind me . It clicks and groans and spews hot air like a fairytale dragon , and still my body shivers with a cold that will never go away , a cold that has been eighty years in the making . Eighty years , I think sometimes , and despite my own acceptance of my age , it still amazes me that I have n't been warm since George Bush was president . I wonder if this is how it is for everyone my age . My life ? It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rip-roaring spectacular I fancied it would be , but neither have I burrowed around with the gophers . I suppose it has most resembled a bluechip stock : fairly stable , more ups than downs , and gradually trending upward over time . A good buy , a lucky buy , and I 've learned that not everyone can say this about his life . But do not be misled . I am nothing special ; of this I am sure . I am a common man with common thoughts , and I 've led a common life . There are no monuments dedicated to me and my name will soon be forgotten , but I 've loved another with all my heart and soul , and to me , this has always been enough . The romantics would call this a love story , the cynics would call it a tragedy . In my mind it 's a little bit of both , and no matter how you choose to view it in the end , it does not change the fact that it involves a great deal of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have no complaints about my path and the places it has taken me ; enough complaints to fill a circus tent about other things , maybe , but the path I 've chosen has always been the right one , and I would n't have had it any other way . Time , unfortunately , does n't make it easy to stay on course . The path is straight as ever , but now it is strewn with the rocks and gravel that accumulate over a lifetime . Until three years ago it would have been easy to ignore , but it 's impossible now . There is a sickness rolling through my body ; I 'm neither strong nor healthy , and my days are spent like an old party balloon : listless , spongy , and growing softer over time . I cough , and through squinted eyes I check my watch . I realize it is time to go . I stand from my seat by the window and shuffle across the room , stopping at the desk to pick up the notebook I have read a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead I slip it beneath my arm and continue on my way to the place I must go . I walk on tiled floors , white in color and speckled with gray . Like my hair and the hair of most people here , though I 'm the only one in the hallway this morning . They are in their rooms , alone except for television , but they , like me , are used to it . A person can get used to anything , if given enough time . I hear the muffled sounds of crying in the distance and know exactly who is making those sounds . Then the nurses see me and we smile at each other and exchange greetings . They are my friends and we talk often , but I am sure they wonder about me and the things that I go through every day . I listen as they begin to whisper among themselves as I pass . " There he goes again , " I hear , " I hope it turns out well . " But they say nothing directly to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt me to talk about it so early in the morning , and knowing myself as I do , I think they 're probably right . A minute later , I reach the room . The door has been propped open for me , as it usually is . There are two others in the room , and they too smile at me as I enter . " Good morning , " they say with cheery voices , and I take a moment to ask about the kids and the schools and upcoming vacations . We talk above the crying for a minute or so . They do not seem to notice ; they have become numb to it , but then again , so have I. Afterward I sit in the chair that has come to be shaped like me . They are finishing up now ; her clothes are on , but still she is crying . It will become quieter after they leave , I know . The excitement of the morning always upsets her , and today is no exception . Finally the shade is opened and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smile as they walk by . I wonder what this means . I sit for just a second and stare at her , but she does n't return the look . I understand , for she does n't know who I am . I 'm a stranger to her . Then , turning away , I bow my head and pray silently for the strength I know I will need . I have always been a firm believer in God and the power of prayer , though to be honest , my faith has made for a list of questions I definitely want answered after I 'm gone . Ready now . On go the glasses , out of my pocket comes a magnifier . I put it on the table for a moment while I open the notebook . It takes two licks on my gnarled finger to get the wellworn cover open to the first page . Then I put the magnifier in place . There is always a moment right before I begin to read the story when my mind churns , and I wonder , Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never know beforehand , and deep down it really does n't matter . It 's the possibility that keeps me going , not the guarantee , a sort of wager on my part . And though you may call me a dreamer or fool or any other thing , I believe that anything is possible . I realize the odds , and science , are against me . But science is not the total answer ; this I know , this I have learned in my lifetime . And that leaves me with the belief that miracles , no matter how inexplicable or unbelievable , are real and can occur without regard to the natural order of things . So once again , just as I do every day , I begin to read the notebook aloud , so that she can hear it , in the hope that the miracle that has come to dominate my life will once again prevail . And maybe , just maybe , it will . Ghosts It was early October 1946 , and Noah Calhoun watched the fading sun sink lower from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit here in the evenings , especially after working hard all day , and let his thoughts wander without conscious direction . It was how he relaxed , a routine he 'd learned from his father . He especially liked to look at the trees and their reflections in the river . North Carolina trees are beautiful in deep autumn : greens , yellows , reds , oranges , every shade in between . Their dazzling colors glow with the sun , and for the hundredth time , Noah Calhoun wondered if the original owners of the house had spent their evenings thinking the same things . The house was built in 1772 , making it one of the oldest , as well as largest , homes in New Bern . Originally it was the main house on a working plantation , and he had bought it right after the war ended and had spent the last eleven months and a small fortune repairing it . The reporter from the Raleigh paper had done an article on it a few weeks ago and said it was one of the finest restorations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The remaining property was another story , and that was where he 'd spent most of the day . The home sat on twelve acres adjacent to Brices Creek , and he 'd worked on the wooden fence that lined the other three sides of the property , checking for dry rot or termites , replacing posts when he had to . He still had more work to do on it , especially on the west side , and as he 'd put the tools away earlier he 'd made a mental note to call and have some more lumber delivered . He 'd gone into the house , drunk a glass of sweet tea , then showered . He always showered at the end of the day , the water washing away both dirt and fatigue . Afterward he 'd combed his hair back , put on some faded jeans and a long-sleeved blue shirt , poured himself another glass of sweet tea , and gone to the porch , where he now sat , where he sat every day at this time . He stretched his arms above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoulders as he completed the routine . He felt good and clean now , fresh . His muscles were tired and he knew he 'd be a little sore tomorrow , but he was pleased that he had accomplished most of what he had wanted to do . Noah reached for his guitar , remembering his father as he did so , thinking how much he missed him . He strummed once , adjusted the tension on two strings , then strummed again . This time it sounded about right , and he began to play . Soft music , quiet music . He hummed for a little while at first , then began to sing as night came down around him . He played and sang until the sun was gone and the sky was black . It was a little after seven when he quit , and he settled back into his chair and began to rock . By habit , he looked upward and saw Orion and the Big Dipper , Gemini and the Pole Star , twinkling in the autumn sky . He started to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew he 'd spent almost his entire savings on the house and would have to find a job again soon , but he pushed the thought away and decided to enjoy the remaining months of restoration without worrying about it . It would work out for him , he knew ; it always did . Besides , thinking about money usually bored him . Early on , he 'd learned to enjoy simple things , things that could n't be bought , and he had a hard time understanding people who felt otherwise . It was another trait he got from his father . Clem , his hound dog , came up to him then and nuzzled his hand before lying down at his feet . " Hey , girl , how 're you doing ? " he asked as he patted her head , and she whined softly , her soft round eyes peering upward . A car accident had taken her leg , but she still moved well enough and kept him company on quiet nights like these . He was thirty-one now , not too old , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since he 'd been back here , had n't met anyone who remotely interested him . It was his own fault , he knew . There was something that kept a distance between him and any woman who started to get close , something he was n't sure he could change even if he tried . And sometimes in the moments right before sleep came , he wondered if he was destined to be alone forever . The evening passed , staying warm , nice . Noah listened to the crickets and the rustling leaves , thinking that the sound of nature was more real and aroused more emotion than things like cars and planes . Natural things gave back more than they took , and their sounds always brought him back to the way man was supposed to be . There were times during the war , especially after a major engagement , when he had often thought about these simple sounds . " It 'll keep you from going crazy , " his father had told him the day he 'd shipped out . " It 's God 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished his tea , went inside , found a book , then turned on the porch light on his way back out . After sitting down again , he looked at the book . It was old , the cover was torn , and the pages were stained with mud and water . It was Leaves of Grass by Walt Whitman , and he had carried it with him throughout the war . It had even taken a bullet for him once . He rubbed the cover , dusting it off just a little . Then he let the book open randomly and read the words in front of him : This is thy hour O Soul , thy free flight into the wordless , Away from books , away from art , the day erased , the lesson done , Thee fully forth emerging , silent , gazing , pondering the themes thou lovest best , Night , sleep , death and the stars . He smiled to himself . For some reason Whitman always reminded him of New Bern , and he was glad he 'd come back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was home and he knew a lot of people here , most of them from his youth . It was n't surprising . Like so many southern towns , the people who lived here never changed , they just grew a bit older . ( Continues ... )
