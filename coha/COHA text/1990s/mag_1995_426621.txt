Section : your healthy pet <p> Has your cat pulled out its Lady Godiva locks , or does your dog keep you awake at night biting and chewing at his skin ? Recent breakthroughs may help heal itchiness  --  called pruritus in medicalese  --  one of the most common and disturbing skin problems that afflict dogs and cats . <p> Animals with sore , red or itchy skin should be brought promptly to a veterinarian for diagnosis and treatment . And if your vet is not familiar with the most up-to-date techniques , ask to be referred to a veterinary dermatologist . Even with the best new detection techniques , identifying the cause or causes of an itch can take time , notes Richard Anderson , D.V.M. , staff dermatologist at Angell Memorial Animal Hospital , Boston . New advances may make the process of detection and healing easier than it was before . TAMING THE YEAST <p> Researchers now have a positive I.D . on a common culprit for itching and smelly skin in dogs  --  a yeast known as Malassezia pachydermatis . This yeast is normally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs . But under certain conditions , such as moisture , allergy or inflammation , it multiplies , causing redness and a musty odor , along with itching . Diagnosis is made by doing a skin scraping or biopsy of the affected skin . Treatment with the antifungal drug ketoconazole , combined with antifungal shampoos and rinses , can help control the problem in dogs once doomed to discomfort . NOT MUCH NEEDLING <p> Allergies are a very common cause of itchy skin . But for the past 50 years , finding out whether allergies were due to inhaled substances ( like pollen , house dust or molds ) meant intradermal skin testing , a series of injections just under the surface of the skin , followed by observation of the injection sites . But a new test is available . Veterinarians now can perform special blood tests to identify allergens  --  that means one needle instead of many , which is a relief for both the pet and the veterinarian . STAYING OUT OF THE CORTI-ZONE <p> While cortisone is still considered the most effective drug to treat itchy skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more cautious about prescribing it because of the serious side effects : increased appetite , drinking and urination , and suppression of the adrenal gland . It can also cause a general suppression of the immune system . When cortisone is needed , most veterinarians prescribe it every other day , to minimize side effects . <p> In the meantime , veterinarians try to use other , safer means to soothe sad skin , which can make cortisone unnecessary or at least lower the required dose . <p> Allergy shets For dogs with inhalant allergies , veterinarians for years recommended a program called hypo-sensitization ( better known as allergy shots ) . Still in the pioneering stage , hyposensitization is now being done with cats as well as dogs . The pet is regularly injected with small amounts of substances that trigger inhalant allergies . Owners can learn to do these injections at home . Studies estimate that up to 60 percent of dogs improve after hyposensitization . <p> Special diets Food allergies are another common cause of itching in pets . The best way to diagnose a food allergy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given food to which he 's had little or no previous exposure . Until recently , that meant lamb or lamb-and-rice mixtures . <p> But lamb-based foods have become very popular in pet stores and super-markets in recent years because of the false impression that lamb is hypoallergenic . It 's not  --  it 's just that it used to be something most animals had n't eaten . So if your veterinarian recommends an elimination diet , she 'll probably suggest you use one of the newer products  --  venison and potato for cats , and duck and potato for dogs . Do n't cook up your own version  --  the commercial products are nutritionally balanced . Your veterinarian can tell you where to buy them . The elimination diet is fed for between four and eight weeks . If there is a food allergy , says Dr. Anderson , you 'll usually see improvement within four weeks . Other foods are added gradually , and the animal is closely watched to identify problem foods . BLACK-BAG MAGIC <p> There 's no question that the safest treatment for itchy skin is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's not possible , and  --  regardless of the cause  --  medications must be used to reduce the symptoms . Here are some of the newest tools in veterinarians ' black bags . <p> Antihistamines Veterinarians used to believe that antihistamines did n't relieve itchiness in dogs and cats because they did n't think histamines played much of a role in animal itchiness . But that turned out to be wrong , and new clinical trials have confirmed antihistamines ' effectiveness . The side effects of antihistamines  --  sedation and dry mouth  --  are not as severe as those of cortisone . According to Dr. Anderson , often three or four types of antihistamines must be tried to identify the most effective one for a particular case . Some of the more commonly used antihistamines in pets are the same ones we take for hay fever and allergies , including diphenhydramine ( Benadryl ) . Dr. Anderson and other dermatologists are even reporting promising results from the use of the antidepressant amitriptyline ( Elavil ) . Elavil not only has antihistaminic properties , it also appears to raise the animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irritants to cause a response , Dr. Anderson reports . <p> Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty-acid supplements " We are going back to Mother 's cod-liver oil , " says Dr. Anderson . The omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids play a pivotal role in skin health . Veterinarians sometimes recommend supplements rich in these substances , such as marine fish-oil capsules , to soothe itchy skin . Usually , they 're combined with other treatments like hyposensitization , antihistamines and cordsone , but occasionally they 're all that 's necessary . In fact , in one recent study of 93 allergic dogs , 17 ( 18.3 percent ) showed an excellent response  --  their itchiness was either eliminated or decreased to insignificant levels using supplements alone . In another 16 dogs ( 17.2 percent ) , the pruritus was substantially reduced . Another advantage : Fatty-acid supplements can help to alleviate some of cortisone 's side effects , like skin and coat dryness . " An extra benefit of these oils is that they make the coat very shiny , " says Dr. Anderson . Veterinarians are prescribing the same fish-oil capsules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dosage before trying this therapy , because it could potentially affect blood-platelet functioning and clotting . <p> Medicated shampoos and rinses Shampooing once or twice weekly is often helpful for itchy dogs and cats . For allergic pets , regular shampooing washes away irritating substances . Shampoos can also cool irritated skin and hydrate dry skin . <p> It 's important to use the right product . Frequent shampooing with human shampoo ( even medicated human shampoo ) can make a bad problem worse . Fortunately , there are many new shampoos and rinses targeted to specific pet-skin disorders . In combination with other treatments described here , shampoos can bring faster relief , lower the doses of drugs needed and prevent relapses . <p> Some of these new shampoos and rinses contain specific anti-itch agents , such as colloidal oatmeal or a topical antihistamine . There are even shampoos and rinses that contain a local anesthetic agent . There are , of course , shampoos that contain flea-control products . If bacterial or fungal infections are contributing to irritation , shampoos are available that contain both antibacterial and antifungal agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( COLOR ) : Dr. Marder <p> By Amy Marder , VMD <p> <p> Dr. Marder is a clinical assistant professor at the Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine and animal-behavior consultant to the Massachusetts SPCA and Angell Memorial Animal Hospital Boston . <p>
