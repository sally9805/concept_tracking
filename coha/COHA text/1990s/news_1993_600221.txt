<p> LOS ANGELES The voice was gentle . The speech halting . The tone confident . And the words chilling . <p> " When he said : ' Oh , we 're going to kill you nigger , run . ' I got up and ran . That 's when I was struck . " <p> Rodney Glen King , after two years of virtual silence , took the stand Tuesday in the federal trial of four white police officers accused of violating his civil rights and gave his first public account of the events of March 3 , 1991 . <p> A more slender King , wearing a charcoal-gray pinstripe suit , white shirt and purple-and-pink abstract print tie , drew a graphic picture of his videotaped beating . Jurors , some jotting notes , seemed to hang on every word . <p> As police batons struck him , King said , " They ( police officers ) were chanting : ' How do you feel killer , huh ? How do you feel nigger , huh ? " <p> He was asked whether he truly remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " King said he was n't sure . <p> Prosecutor Barry Kowalski asked how the beating felt . <p> " It felt like when you get up in the middle of the night and you jam your toe , " said King . <p> " My whole body was struck . . . . Every time I would get hit , it felt like jamming your toe in a piece of metal . . . . There was an enormous amount of pain . " <p> After the beating , " I was having trouble remembering exactly what went on but I know for sure I was attacked by police officers . " <p> Anger rarely seeped into King 's voice except when he shared his emotions after watching himself being beaten on video a tape he said he saw about 10 times . <p> " It 's sickening to see it . It makes me sick to my stomach to watch it , " King said during 40 minutes of questioning by prosecutors . <p> His final words under direct examination : " I was just trying to stay alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I never had a chance to stay still . " <p> His testimony moved many in the jammed courtroom . <p> " The words , ' I was just trying to stay alive ' , really hit home , " said Richard Burns , 53 , a furloughed aerospace worker who 's been in court every day since the start of testimony . <p> Tuesday , Burns got in line at 6 a.m. to make sure he could hear King testify . <p> " I really felt for him , " said Burns . " Now , there 's no doubt in my mind . There 's no truth to what the officers have been saying at all . " <p> One observer sobbed as King described being shot with a Taser gun and hit by batons . <p> The stun gun , King said , made it feel " like my blood was boiling inside of me . " <p> Defendant Theodore Briseno leaned forward , elbows on knees , cupping his chin . <p> Odessa King listened attentively to her son 's testimony . <p> " This has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courtroom . " But he has been looking forward to this , to coming and telling his side of the story . " <p> And seemingly everyone wanted to hear it . <p> " It feels like opening night , " said Mona Shafer Edwards , KABC-TV courtroom artist , as she began sketching King . " It 's what everyone is waiting for . " <p> Ruth Ferguson , 65 , said she came from Washington , D.C. , for Tuesday 's testimony . " I wanted to see Rodney King . He seemed to be doing real good . I just hope he gets a fair shake . " <p> Loyola Law School professor Laurie Levenson thought King " did what he had to do , which was come across as somebody not perfect but who still did n't deserve to be beaten like that . " <p> Said lawyer Barry Levin , a former Los Angeles police officer : King will probably be " the prosecution 's best witness . " <p> But defendant Stacey Koon , a suspended police sergeant , said King 's testimony would damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just another arrestee out of thousands . Seeing Rodney King is not going to bother me . " <p> King is expected back on the stand today for lengthy cross-examination by the defense . <p> Lawyer Paul DePasquale , defending fired rookie officer Timothy Wind , is expected to engage in the lengthiest cross-examination . But it may not be the most contentious . <p> Tuesday , King faced an obviously testy Michael Stone , the lawyer representing suspended officer Laurence Powell , who is seen on the videotape striking King the most . <p> Stone honed in on King 's weight loss in an attempt to show jurors that King 's physique was more threatening at the time of the incident . <p> He also focused on King 's past criminal record and his behavior when police tried to stop him . And he pointed out inconsistencies in King 's statements to police and his parole officer all an effort to cloud King 's credibility . <p> " Speeding and drinking and lying to the police because you did n't want to go back to prison . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth , " Stone said to King . <p> But even Stone later said King " looked very good . He was mild-mannered , polite and thoughtful . All of these things spell credibility . " <p> Jurors probably think King is telling the truth , Stone said , " but I 'm sure further developments will prove otherwise . " <p> Stone also pointed out that King had a strong motive to appear credible today a multimillion-dollar civil suit against the city that is on hold until the federal trial is over . <p> To almost all observers , King was a much different witness than state prosecutor Terry White expected last year in the four officers ' first trial . <p> White was criticized for not putting King on the stand , especially when the officers were acquitted on all but one count of excessive force . <p> The verdicts sparked the costliest riots in U.S. history . <p> White , in a July 1992 interview with Vanity Fair , said King was so angered by the beating that he feared King would lose his temper in court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prosecutors asked him about his drinking the night of the beating ; he freely admitted " I had a lot to drink . " <p> And he said that when he saw the flashing lights behind him , " I kind of thought the problem would just go away . " <p> King 's resolve will be tested further today . But legal experts think defense lawyers would be wise to get him off the stand as soon as possible . <p> " Attempting to beat him down or having him slander himself through his own lips is probably a harsh mistake , " Levin said . " Jurors will then think lawyers are taking advantage of Rodney King . " <p> If defense lawyers insist on grilling King another whole day , prosecutors could have a field day in closing arguments . <p> They 'll argue " they beat him up in person and they beat him up again in court , " said John Gilleland , a jury consultant . <p> But to Vartan Sarkisian , a Glendale dental technician who has been in court daily , King is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's the home run ball . If they do n't do it with him , they 've lost the case . " <p> Contributing : James Harney and Jonathan T. Lovitt
