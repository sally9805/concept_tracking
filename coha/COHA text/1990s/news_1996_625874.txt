<p> The Rev. Michael Patrick Williams is going back to the future . <p> The Pentecostal minister is leading his 1,200-member Joy Tabernacle from its northeast Houston suburban home to the heart of the inner city . Williams , an African-American , plans a $ 6 million church complex on a 10-acre tract at 4922 Griggs Road , in one of Houston 's more blighted areas . The new church will spearhead spiritual and social renewal for some of the city 's most forgotten residents , he said . <p> Williams is convinced God wants him to undertake the project . <p> " " In 1991 , God spoke to me about this move , " said Williams , a Yale University divinity school graduate and adjunct professor in the African-American Studies program at the University of Houston . He pastored Houston 's historic Antioch Missionary Baptist Church , at 500 Clay , for two years before founding Joy Tabernacle in 1986 . The St. Louis native was pastor of East End Baptist Church in Bridgeport , Conn. , for 10 years before coming to Houston . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff like that , " Williams , 44 , hastened to explain . <p> Hardly . <p> Williams ' polished preaching is admired by such national leaders as the Rev.Jesse Jackson and the Rev. Lawrence E. Carter , dean of the Martin Luther King Jr . Chapel at Atlanta 's Morehouse College . " " Williams is an exceptional church man , " Carter said . " " He is articulate with an above average biblical depth and understanding . He is a builder and a very strong family man . " <p> Williams has preached in Canada , the Philippines , the Caribbean and the Middle East . <p> " " One thing about Michael Patrick Williams is that he has a clear message , " said Quinnelle Chatmon , a charter member of Joy Tabernacle . " " It is a now word for people of today . " <p> Williams was inducted in 1994 into Morehouse College 's 11-year-old Martin Luther King Jr.Board of Preachers . About 100 ministers nationwide have been selected for the board , which honors ministers who are " " in the prophetic preaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> When he talks about his newest goal , Williams remembers a dream he had in 1991 . In it , he saw a large Houston map with the city 's southeast area , popularly known as the Third Ward , clearly delineated . In the map was the University of Houston Central Campus , Texas Southern University , Palm Center and the Astrodome . The Third Ward was roughly south of Congress Avenue , east of Main Street and north of Brays Bayou . <p> " " I saw a hand circle this area as if with a marker and I heard a voice that said ' Go there ! ' " Williams said . " " I woke up but the dream stayed with me . " After a few months , the minister consulted a veteran commercial real estate agent who promptly assured him there was no undeveloped acreage in that area . The best Williams could hope for was to patch together a few commercial lots . <p> His members were also less than thrilled when Williams announced the designated area . " " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although the area was once one of the city 's preferred residential and commercial communities , it is now characterized by high crime rates , deteriorated buildings and anxious residents . <p> Palm Center , once home to such major retail stores as JCPenney 's and Montgomery Ward , is half-shuttered . It now leases space to several government offices . It is a few blocks from the Joy Tabernacle site . <p> " " I look into the eyes of people out here and there is a lot of fear , " he said . " " Some of it is physical fear for person and possessions . But some of it is fear of the future . Enough people have lived here to see this community die , and they have not been able to get out . " <p> After three years of off-and-on searching , the astounded agent discovered a 10-acre tract that was once a trailer park . <p> " " I knew the land was there , " Williams said . The church purchased the tract for $ 215,000 in cash last year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move to renovated , leased offices near the tract . Williams is launching a $ 1 million fund-raising campaign among his members this fall to finance the first year of construction . <p> Chatmon , who grew up in the Third Ward area , said she is excited about the return , as are most members . " " I am going to have an opportunity to go back and do something to help African-Americans , " she said . <p> By June , the tract will be cleared . Construction will begin in the fall on the new worship center that will include state-of-the-art video and audio studios . The church is expected to open by Easter 1998 . <p> Included in the first phase of construction will be a multipurpose building with a seating capacity of 500 and recreational space for basketball , volleyball and other activities . Classrooms will serve the Joy Bible Institute for ministerial training . <p> Plans call for the eventual development of a day school , Joy Christian Academy . <p> Joy Tabernacle 's development is a needed boost for the area , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " The community is going to be happy to have new folks coming in with new blood , " Thompson said . <p> It reverses the trend of churches moving out of the area . <p> " " Frankly , I was surprised when I saw the signs saying it was the future site of Joy Tabernacle , " she said . " " They are making an investment in an area that needs this type of encouragement . " But Williams envisions more than new bricks and mortar . He want Joy Tabernacle to be the epicenter of spiritual and community renewal . <p> " " The No. 1 problem in the inner city is that people have lost hope , " Williams said . " " ( Inner-city residents ) believe they are destined to have nothing in their lives but defeat , difficulty , degradation and problems over and over again without any possibility of victory or rescue . " <p> " " If there is any one thing that the gospel of Jesus Christ offers , it is hope , " he said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spiritual coalition to address community problems . " " There are churches in every corner of urban America , " Williams said , " " but the pathology ( sickness ) is worse than it has ever been . People are not seeing the transforming power of the gospel . " <p> That transformation can come only from faith and reliance on God , he said . " " I believe some of the things we are facing in urban America are going to change only by divine intervention , " he said . " " What would have been the Las Vegas odds on David vs . Goliath or Daniel in the lions ' den ? " <p> To help that spiritual transformation , Williams is establishing the Bible institute to train African-American clergy in effective ministry . Williams created the Alliance of Restoration Ministries in 1993 , a think-tank organization to upgrade the vision and training of black ministers . Many black churches are small with limited resources and ministers who work part-time . Those ministers are often ignored or overlooked by larger churches , Williams said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other and exchange information on common problems . A 1994 conference attracted 100 ministers from 18 states . <p> Another conference is slated for May . <p> " " I want my hand on the theological training of black ministers in Houston in the 21st century , " he said . <p> Social-service programs are not the solution , he said . " " We want to get people off the addiction of social services , " he said . " " I am more into empowerment than charity . " <p> One way he hopes to achieve this will be monthly weekend festivals featuring entertainment , food and vendors . The festivals will be community-building events and offer opportunities for evangelism . They are expected to promote economic opportunity for the small businesses and vendors that participate . <p> Williams also has formed an economic development corporation in hopes of financing and renovating homes for area residents . But the minister has not forgotten his church at 618 Baca in northeast Houston . <p> That site will remain open as a community center and for youth ministry . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Williams sees service possibilities in his church 's old neighborhood , too . <p> " " God did not stay up in heaven but wrapped himself in human flesh that he might come to where the problems were , " he said .
