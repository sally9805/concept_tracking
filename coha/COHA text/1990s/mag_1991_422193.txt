Section : Articles The August Revolution For almost eighty years , the Communist Party governed the Soviet Union . Only a month ago its power remained essentiall intact . There was widespread fear of a neo-Stalinist reaction . Why did it collapse in three days ? <p> EDGAR ALLAN POE , in his horrible story The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar , ' has as his theme a man who is put under hypnosis just as he is dying . When he is dead , though looking haggard and livid , he still stays in contact with the doctors conducting the experiment . After some weeks they decide to wake him , but the moment he comes out of the trance he turns into a putrescent corpse . The Soviet Communist regime , too , was lacking all but a semblance of life , held together not by any vital principle but only , in effect , by a hypnotic spell . Its active beliefs and ideology had become mere reflex habits . Its economy consisted of an outward shell , with all the reality eaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only by artificial and unnatural means . ( Waldemar , it may be noted , is a variant of Vladimir . . . ) <p> What was the nature of the forces which prevented its early disintegration ? Civic society in the Russian Empire was already weak , and in 1917 it was totally destroyed . The extent to which Leninism  --  Stalinism penetrated is to be seen in dozens of remarks by now prominent democrats , such as All my life I had Stalin in me ' and The servile terror of Stalin lives in the bones and veins of people who never knew him . ' Even a century ago , Anton Chekhov laid down Russia 's task as to squeeze out the slave drop by drop . ' The effort that has had to be made over the past five or six years was to squeeze out not merely the barbaric past , but also the far more deadly transfusion of the newer Marxist poisons . One advantage this generation had : the Communist experience was so frightful , and in so many ways , that once the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russians and their fellow subjects with ever-increasing horror and revulsion . Almost every family had contributed one or more victims to the cycles of terror which had marked the period . All but a few Russians had imbibed accounts of their history which were now exposed as disgusting lies and libels . And when the carapace cracked , there came the consciousness that the economic and social system for which all these sacrifices had been made was a disaster and a fraud . So Many Heroes <p> Some strange reactions to this massive revulsion were to be found in the West . One or two commentators here carped to the effect that only a few hundred thousand people turned out in Moscow and St. Petersburg : a point well answered by a middle-aged citizen of the former who told the Western press that though fully in sympathy with the Yeltsinites , he and his family had indeed sat out the crisis . Those who had gone into the streets , he added , were heroes , as he was not ; and it was extraordinary that Moscow had so many heroes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the hero of heroes . But acceptance of this also encountered a certain amount of resistance over here . He was a little crude . He was a populist . ' Perhaps he was interested in power . All of which may remind us of the reaction of refined souls in Washington to the arrival of Andrew Jackson . And such deplorable vulgarians come to mind as Ernest Bevin and Harry Truman . Slob ' and boozer ' were among other characterizations of Yeltsin ( though these may not seem appropriate in the mouths supporters of a senator or so one might mention ) . <p> Now Yeltsin may not be suited to a part in Les Liaisons Dangereuses . Indeed , and more importantly , he may fail in some future crisis . But to rate him just on his social graces is shallow to the point of flippancy . Stalin made an excellent social impression on Roosevelt , which warped the latter 's judgment and led to actions as stupid as they were dangerous . We can not afford to have these adolescent crushes and hostilities . Yeltsin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the future . We need not become uncritical about him , as so many have been about Gorbachev . But for the present he is the best we have  --  and also the first ever elected leader of Russia . <p> This soggy personal relations ' stuff was also to be noted ( though in the other direction ) in , for example , remarks by some of our military and other figures on how sad it was about arms negotiator Marshal Akhromeyev , what a great fellow he had been , how well they 'd got on together . He seemed nice ' enough when I met him . But his career had been devoted to destroying us ! Such negotiations should not lead us to behave like those neighbors of killer-rapists who tell the newspapers what regular guys they were . . . Reserved Rejoicing <p> The emergence of civil society , the squeezing out of the slave mentality , are matters for unreserved rejoicing . They imply a better future . But they do not guarantee it . The economy is in such a desperate state , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poverty lying ahead might lead to a collapse of civil patience , a crisis of morale , before positive results emerge . It is in this context that we should view one of the commonest reports from Russia  --  of citizens who fear that some later attempt to restore the old order may yet be made . <p> In that connection , though not only in that connection , we need to look at pressure from certain quarters to cut off Radio Liberty . In the crisis , it played an irreplaceable role  --  even being referred to by Gorbachev as one of his links to reality . The BBC and VOA were also very useful . But what Radio Liberty amounted to , as it has done over its whole existence , was and is a voice for the Russian and other Soviet peoples when they are deprived of one of their own . Its premature demise would have been an encouragement to Communist reaction , and if it ever takes place will be an encouragement to any successors . <p> Radio Liberty was , of course , a target @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrument of the cold war . But what was the cold war ? From the start , as is now perfectly clear , it was a contest between , on the one hand , Stalin and his successors , with their apparatus of corrupt fanatics , and , on the other , ourselves and the Soviet people . This is , indeed , accepted as a truism in Moscow . It was a little peculiar , then , to read in President Bush 's Kiev speech a month ago , In the past , our nations engaged in duels of eloquent bluff and bravado , and now the fireworks of superpower confrontation are giving way to the quieter and far more hopeful arts of cooperation . ' Leaving aside what nation ' he imagined himself to be addressing in the Ukrainian capital , we see that he , or his speechwriter , was sneering at the policies of Ronald Reagan and the other Western leaders which , as every Muscovite will tell you , held the line until the despotism collapsed , and which made that collapse possible . But not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurrah , meanwhile , for Congressman Solarz . <p> Indeed , it is quite extraordinary that the Democrats now feel themselves at a disadvantage , given the Administration 's handling of the Soviet crisis  --  from the first favorable remarks about the gangster front-man Yanayev to the delay in recognizing Baltic independence . Both of these mistakes might have done harm : the first , obviously , by encouraging the plotters at a critical moment ; the second by encouraging Gorbachev in his ploy of demanding legal processes ' over the Baltic issue ( rather like a kidnapper telling a victim who is making his escape that this can only be done on a court order ) . The impression given is of yet more Administration nostalgia for the supposed stability ' of the system centralized on Moscow , as against the principle of nationality . <p> One of the constituencies on which the plotters relied was clearly the extreme Russian nationalist-imperialists , including the anti-Semitic element . These had , over the past years , done very badly in elections . But they were vocal , and thought by democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the event Russianism was almost totally pre-empted by Yeltsin , on a program of complete non-chauvinism  --  including , of course , the immediate recognition of Baltic independence . This was crucial . And in the past week , as we have seen , the emphasis of the revolution has shifted from the destruction of despotism to the ending of empire . <p> In his Kiev speech Bush rightly warned against a suicidal nationalism based upon ethnic hatred . ' And in some areas of the former USSR these are showing themselves  --  especially the Caucasus . But the faintest suggestion that this could and should be coped with by Moscow rule is both superficial and dangerous . Such arrangements did not solve the problem over the centuries of czarist and Soviet dominion . Nor can that empire , even in a much milder version , be restored  --  at least , not without a slaughter quite as bad as the slaughters possibly arising from interethnic troubles . Which is not to say that Russian troops might not help in a crisis , perhaps as part of a UN force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unanimously execrated in its Napoleonic invasion of Spain , was welcomed back with great warmth when it returned under the Bourbons only a decade later . But such would be in exceptional cases . In the main , the relationships between the Republics need no nannying . <p> It is true , as is sometimes argued in favor of Moscocentrism , that their economies are closely interlinked across the old USSR . An engine will be made in Moldova , its spark plugs in Kazakhstan . Therefore , we are told , there must be a central co-ordinating agency . One of my recent books was published in London and printed in India , without either help or hindrance from the British or Indian government , or the United Nations or even UNESCO . It will take a time before such arrangements become possible in the ex-Union ( one Ukrainian factory had to close down for two weeks after breaking off with the Ministry in Moscow ) . But after an interim , centralization need not be more than minimal . Nor need it imply any political centralization whatever . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea of the stability supposedly found in the old status quo , a reluctance to face the possibly unpredictable yet all the same unavoidable future , is in accordance with my warning , in NR 's last issue , against a historical political science . ' The future , like the past , is not amenable to schematic treatment . When our political leadership broadens its perspectives ( and our media give less time to lunatic assessments ) , we shall be in a better position to understand and help the democratic revolution which faces such desperate problems . <p> Photo : UNKNOWN <p> Cartoon : Evening Standard , London , 1948 <p> By ROBERT CONQUEST <p> <p> Mr. Conquest is the distinguished Sovietologist and author of a forthcoming biography of Stalin . <p>
