<p> It has been a while since an expansion team pitcher with a history of surgical repair has been able to manipulate baseball 's trade market . But these are strange times for baseball , and Bryan Harvey is a man who understands the new rules . <p> Harvey , limited to 12 appearances last season due an abdominal strain that required surgery , has shown himself fit enough to ask the Florida Marlins to trade him for the good of the Marlins . <p> " I 'd love to stay here as long as possible , " Harvey said , " but ( closer candidate Robbie ) Nen is 25 . If we were in another division , I do n't think any moves would be made . But they 've got to give Robbie the ball and let him prove he 's the stopper . The money I 'm making , they could get one or two more players . " <p> This is more a camouflaged request to move to a contender , which set off alarms in Cleveland , where scouts were quickly dispatched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arm is all right to me , " said Indians scout Ted Simmons . " And if his arm is sound , he 's death on anybody . " <p> Harvey may not have had such a quick response in another year . The Braves were interested in Harvey even two years ago but could never make a deal . The Yankees last spring almost dealt for him before he was injured . But in the current buyer 's market , player availability has gone up while the richer clubs can pick and chose . Indians owner Dick Jacobs issued permission to check on closer deals , which GM John Hart attempted to downplay . Asked why he had scouts checking Harvey as well as Minnesota 's Rick Aguilera and Kansas City 's Jeff Montgomery , Hart said , " Down the road , if things do n't work out for us , then we may have to look around . That 's my story and I 'm sticking to it . " <p> The Indians ' lone deficiency remains at closer , where Matt Shuey will try again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left open by the death of Steve Olin in 1993 . ( In news of little surprise , Ex- Brave Gregg Olson , now an Indian , is no help , currently on the DL again . ) The Marlins would want prospects in return , particularly pitcher Julian Tavarez , whom Cleveland covets . <p> Still , several deals have been pulled off this spring on a name-your- price basis , and Harvey , while pleased with the Marlins , talks between the lines of working for a contender . He 'll be 32 in June . " This is a tough division , " he said . " I think we can play with anybody , but can we compete with Atlanta ? I do n't think so . " <p> UNION MIFFS ALOU : Montreal 's Felipe Alou was not amused with the replacement players list the Players Association has sent to each player rep , so that they might cross-reference any potential replacement who gets called up . " I want them to put my name on the list and because my last name starts with A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the manager said . " I was part of replacement baseball and it does n't bother me . But is the Player 's Association going to make up a list of guys who 've been on drugs or guys caught with prostitutes ? I would n't want my name on those lists . Which list are they going to put Darryl Strawberry 's name on ? " <p> A RETIRED BUTLER ? New York Met Brett Butler says now that if no one would hire him for his going rate ( $ 2 million a season ) , he was prepared to walk away this spring , though he had remained productive in his 14th season . " Ultimately , either I was going to get $ 2 million , " Butler said , " or I was going to retire . It was that simple . I would have tipped my hat and gone home . <p> I 'm a man of integrity . I could see the writing on the wall and my role in the union was part of it . I did n't need the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , or I 'm going home and raise my kids . " . . . The soreness in Tommy Greene 's mystery shoulder continues to baffle Phillies management . After Greene was all but forced to pitch against Baltimore and showed little velocity , manager Jim Fregosi said , " You have to go through certain things in this game . I do n't think Tommy Greene wants an operation . I do n't want Tommy Greene to have an operation . To me , an operation is the last resort . But we shut him down all of 1992 and most of 1994 . And that did not seem to help . " The source of pain remains undiagnosed . <p> CAPT . PENDLETON : Atlanta 's old third baseman went 2-for-3 in his first crack against his old club last week but he could hardly enjoy it . Florida 's Terry Pendleton was facing Tom Glavine , a golf partner and neighbor , whom he ripped him for a clean single first time up . Only he could hardly get himself to look at him , staring instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , he said , ' You 're welcome , Mr. Pendleton . ' I said , ' Thank you , Mr. Glavine . ' " . . . When the Rockies rolled over manager Don Baylor 's contract , general manager Bob Gebhart said he would like to make it an annual event . So would Baylor . " Going into a new facility like Coors Field and with the fan base we have I would n't want to be anywhere else , " Baylor said . " The players also are happy - at least the decent players . " <p> TONY ANGEL : Roswell 's Tony Phillips became a California Angel because the club sought to dump center fielder Chad Curtis ' $ 3.9 million contract . In Phillips , the Angels get a better leadoff hitter and better clubhouse presence , though there 's a question over retaining him next year . " Defensively the deal is a push but it makes us a better offensive club this year and it puts us in a better financial position to get more pitching next year , " GM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clubhouse is upside-down even before the season begins . Johnny Oates will take a couple weeks ' leave to tend to his ailing wife ( either bench coach Bucky Dent or third base coach Jerry Narron will take over ) . Left field muscle boy Juan Gonzalez will miss up to three weeks with a herniated disc in his lower back , which he sustained while tying his shoes before a game last Sunday . <p> FULL COUNT : St. Louis catcher Tom Pagnozzi has seen enough already to know replacement umpiring is a bad idea . " These guys were guys who could n't hack it in the minor leagues , " he said . " How in the hell can you expect them to hack it in the major leagues ? Some of these guys have been apologizing . ' Sorry , ' they say . Well , sorry 's too late . Maybe one time you say , ' I missed it . ' We 're on a baseball field competing . It 's not ' Sorry . ' " . . . Barry Bonds ' new surgically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit four home runs in his first 14 spring at-bats , including a long-distance call against Colorado 's Kevin Ritz . " Michael Jordan can stay out a year and score 55 points , " said Giants manager Dusty Baker . " Barry Bonds can stay out eight months and hit one 500 feet . " . . . The White Sox report Rob Dibble has been hitting 95 mph with his post-operative arm . Those reports also include bouts of intermittent wildness . . . . Sid Fernandez did what the Orioles asked , dropping nearly 40 pounds to 222 and now he says it 's ruining him . After allowing two runs , five hits and a walk in five innings last week , he said , " I just do n't feel like I 'm throwing hard . I feel like a little wimp. "
