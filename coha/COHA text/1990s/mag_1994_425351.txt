Mix bulbs with perennials for extra color and interest <p> ONE GLORIOUS JUNE afternoon , many years ago , I was strolling with a friend through her cottage garden . Her shrub roses were in bloom and honeysuckle perfumed the air . The narrow borders on either side of the brick path to the front door were a rainbow of bearded and Siberian irises , Oriental poppies , and peonies . Along the edges , sprawls of hardy geraniums mingled with lady's-mantle and cottage pinks . <p> As we walked up the path she talked about her garden 's lengthy period of bloom . Beginning in late March , she said , long before the perennials were in flower , her borders were thick with snowdrops and scillas , followed in April by early-blooming tulips and narcissi , then a succession of various lilies through the summer . <p> Astonished , I looked at the thickly planted borders , barely three feet wide , and wondered what in the world she was talking about . " But where do you plant the bulbs ? " I asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in there , what happens when the bulb foliage dies back and looks absolutely awful ? " <p> She accepted my questions as a matter of course and patiently answered them , plus a good many I did n't even know to ask . Basically , her technique was to space and plant the bulbs between the perennials in layers , placing the largest ones deepest and the smallest ones closest to the surface of the soil . She carefully planned the color combinations and succession of bloom . " And each fall I add new varieties or species I have n't grown before , " she said . " I use a fork to gently lift a section of soil . Sometimes I damage a few of the existing bulbs , but so many have self-seeded or multiplied that the soil is rather like a fruitcake packed solid with bulbs . You must come to see it next spring . " <p> I did visit the following spring , several times , and got a chance to see the parade of blooming bulbs for myself . When my own borders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snowdrops and crocuses . Later , I saw pale yellow narcissi and pink tulips mingled with emerging perennials . Inspired by her example , I have since made spring- and summer-blooming bulbs a key element in my garden and in the gardens I design for others . Designing a bulb planting <p> The first step in designing a bulb planting for a garden or border is planning . I start by drawing up a list of bulbs I would like to use , keeping in mind the effect and mood I want to create . I choose candidates on the basis of bloom time , color , and flower style , as well as scale . Over the years , I have developed what I call my " basic " bulb palette . By planting these same bulbs in different colors and combinations , the most wonderful and varied effects can be achieved , giving each garden its own character . <p> For the early part of the season , I rely heavily on bulbs that naturalize and multiply , such as galanthus , scillas , small early-blooming varieties of species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give a border a wash of crisp spring color , I mix blue Chionodoxa sardensis and Scilla siberica with white Galanthus nivalis and species crocuses , such as Crocus chrysanthus Ard Schenk ' . This blue-and-white show is followed by the later-blooming crocus Giant Yellow ' and the pure white Jeanne d'Arc ' . <p> I also mix various Crocus chrysanthus varieties for a rich , almost Byzantine effect , combining Cream Beauty ' ( a creamy white ) , the variety fuscotinctus ( bronze with violet stripes ) , Herald ' ( yellow with bronze ) , and Saturnus ' ( golden-yellow with brownish purple stripes ) . Depending on the size of the border , I use as few as a couple dozen , hundreds , or as many as a thousand of each variety . <p> These small , early bulbs are followed by later-blooming narcissi and tulips . There are countless narcissus varieties worth growing ; good selections can be found in specialty catalogs . As for tulips , I particularly like Tulipa fosteriana , T. greigii , T. kaufmanniana , and their varieties because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hybrid tulips , but recognize that they are short-lived by comparison and will need to be replaced on a regular basis . <p> After that I add a succession of summer-blooming lilies , beginning with the Asiatics . I have found that many of these self-sow in my garden if the seedpods are allowed to dry out on the plant . The seedlings may not be exact duplicates of their hybrid parents , but they are worth encouraging . Two that I 'm especially fond of are the deep rose-pink Montreux ' and the white Sterling Star ' . <p> Another consideration when designing with bulbs is their height . I like to mix short and tall narcissi and tulips of various types , which gives the garden an attractive layered look . This is also a wonderful technique for getting a longer and richer succession of bloom in a small space . Planning for this effect is a matter of looking up and noting the plant heights . For example , I 'll plant the 12-to 14-inch Cragford ' , a tazetta narcissus with clusters of white flowers with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Milner ' , which has creamy yellow flowers . They bloom together in the early to middle part of the season . I also like to combine mid- and late-blooming narcissi with tulips of various heights . <p> The relative size of neighboring plants is another thing to be aware of when planting bulbs in a border . Select bulbs that are tall enough so that their flowers do n't get lost in the emerging foliage of perennials and groundcovers . <p> Once I 've chosen the plants I want to use , I make a rough pencil sketch of the planting area on tracing paper , using a scale of a half-inch to one foot , and note the approximate location and size for each grouping of bulbs . I mark each group with its season of bloom , using E for early , and so on , starting with the daffodils and moving on to the tulips . This system helps me keep the border balanced so that all the early bulbs do n't end up on one side and all the late-blooming ones on the other . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes even on a separate sheet to avoid confusion . While the exact locations of the bulb groupings usually get shifted around during planting , having a rough sketch , with its many overlapping circles , is very helpful once I am outside surrounded by bags and boxes of dozens of different bulbs . Situating perennials <p> When I think back to my friend 's garden , I realize that she chose and situated her perennials with care . Although there are no rules about which perennials are best with which bulbs , I have discovered a number of combinations that are particularly lovely and useful . <p> Perennials that bloom early to mid-season can create both a delicate background and a complement to spring bulbs . For example , Phlox divaricata ( which has soft green foliage and blue flowers ) or Dicentra eximia ( with fernlike , light green foliage and pink , heart-shaped flowers ) combine well with miniature daffodils like the early-to-mid-season Tete-a-Tete ' ( buttercup-yellow petals with yellow-orange centers ) and Minnow ' ( white petals with buttercup-yellow centers ) . <p> Emerging perennial foliage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulb colors look wonderful against a tapestry of leaf shapes , textures , and shades of green . Good mid-spring candidates include astilbes , epimediums , peonies , and Siberian irises . I like to interplant Siberian irises with lily-flowered tulips such as White Triumphator ' and deep rose Mariette ' . The green spears of the iris echo the willowy grace of the tulips . <p> Perennials with attractive , long-lasting , lush foliage are especially useful for hiding dying bulb leaves . Some that work well are astilbes , catmints ( Nepeta species ) , hardy geraniums , lady's-mantle ( Alchemilla mollis ) , and peonies . One of my favorite combinations is hardy geraniums with smaller , very early-blooming bulbs . Along the front edge of one border , I underplanted Geranium sanguineum var. striatum with Crocus chrysanthus Blue Bird ' and Cream Beauty ' and the later-blooming crocuses Jeanne d'Arc ' ( white ) and Pickwick ' ( pale blue with white stripes ) . The bulbs ' flowers were nearly gone by the time the geranium 's first foliage appeared , effectively hiding what was left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the same border , I planted taller tulips and narcissi between clumps of lady's-mantle and astilbe . If you plant these perennials about eight inches apart , there is plenty of room for groups of bulbs between them . The late-blooming Narcissus Geranium ' , which bears clusters of small white-and-orange flowers , and N. Thalia ' , which has two to five graceful white flowers per stem , work well in this setting . I also added the late double tulip Angelique ' ; after a heavy mist or rain , its ruffled , pale pink flowers seem to float above the glistening foliage of the lady's-mantle . By late spring , the perennials fill in , forming eight- to 10-inch mounds that neatly cover the fading bulb leaves and create the effusive , overflowing look of a cottage garden . And by late June and July , those same clumps of lady's-mantle have masses of tiny chartreuse flowers , becoming an exuberant backdrop for a succession of pink and creamy-white Asiatic lilies . Planting the bulbs <p> The time to plant a bulb border is in the fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perennials and rake out any fallen leaves . While this sounds only too obvious , I wish someone had mentioned it to me , because the first time I set out to plant a bulb border , I did n't take the time to do this . Crocus and snowdrop bulbs got lost among the leaves and perennial foliage , and for weeks afterward it was like an autumnal Easter-egg hunt as I rooted around for those I had missed planting . <p> When laying out bulbs , I use my pencil sketch as a general guide . Rarely do I bother to measure anything out on the ground . Instead , I figure out the approximate numbers and placement for each area , then I scatter the bulbs by the handful , rather like strewing grass seed . This technique creates a more informal effect that I find suits the look of most perennial borders . It also saves a tremendous amount of time , especially if you 're planting bulbs by the hundreds . <p> I have found , through trial and error , that it is easier first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tulips , and lilies . Plant these five to eight inches deep ( depending on the variety and where you garden ) . Then broadcast the smaller bulbs ( often right over the newly planted larger bulbs ) and plant these more shallowly , only three to four inches deep . Somehow the bulbs seem to shift and settle and find enough room and soil to grow . <p> How much space I allow between the bulbs depends on the variety and the effect I 'm after . When scattered by the handful , crocuses , chionodoxas , snowdrops , and various miniature narcissi generally land one to four inches apart . If some of them do end up in a heap , simply pick them up and move them where you want them to grow . Aim to plant the larger daffodil , narcissus , and tulip bulbs from four to eight inches apart , depending on how dense an effect you want to create . <p> The only time I do n't use this technique is with lilies . I place these carefully , in part because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see tossing around bulbs that cost as much as $6 apiece . The spacing between lilies varies . For a bold planting of Asiatics as a border feature , I plant the bulbs from three to six inches apart . If they are to be used as a wash of color , perhaps amid a mass planting of later-blooming Anemone xhybrida . I may place them as far as 10 or 12 inches apart . The larger , more spectacular Orientals and trumpets I plant anywhere from 10 to 18 or 24 inches apart . Maintaining a bulb border <p> Maintaining spring- and summer-blooming bulbs in a perennial border is easy . With the small , early-blooming bulbs , such as chionodoxas , crocuses , and scillas , it is pretty much a matter of leaving them alone . Their foliage dies back in an inconspicuous manner and because they are early and low-growing , any yellowing leaves that remain are usually covered by emerging perennials . <p> The dying foliage of species and perennial tulips , on the other hand , eventually becomes quite nasty looking . Because their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next year , I try to place them among perennials with lots of leaves . Otherwise , I wait until they yellow and wither , then give each stalk a gentle tug . If the stalk detaches easily and cleanly from the bulb , fine . If it still seems firmly attached , I try to curb my impatience , wait a few days or a week , and try again . ( I use the same approach with lilies , except for the Asiatics that I let go to seed . ) <p> Narcissus foliage also turns yellow and must be left until it has matured . When the leaves begin to fall over and become unsightly , I simply tuck them under surrounding perennials . In late June or early July ( depending on the year ) , when they have turned yellow , I cut them back to the ground . <p> After the hybrid tulips are through blooming , their large , floppy leaves are the messiest of all . Because all their energy seems to go into one glorious display , without much left over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rather than wait for them to become yellow and bedraggled , I just pull them up ( bulb and all ) after the flowers are past and add them to the compost pile . <p> To get top performance it is a good practice to feed bulb plantings . In late fall or early spring , if I have time , I top-dress the beds with wood ash because it is an excellent source of potash . Some gardeners prefer to use a slow-release 5-10-20 fertilizer . In either case , this treatment supplies the bulbs with nutrients while they are growing  --  from the fall when they begin to root until June when the foliage matures . <p> My borders are now so thick with naturalized bulbs that when perennials need dividing , bulbs are invariably lifted in the process . It looks more like I 'm harvesting bulbs than dividing plants , and I am reminded of my friend 's " fruitcake " remark . <p> Once the divisions are planted , I tuck the bulbs back into the ground at the appropriate depth . There are always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden or give away to my neighbor . And just about the time I 've absolutely had it with dirty snow or bare , brown earth and am longing for spring , the garden bursts into glorious bloom with hundreds of snowdrops and brilliant blue scillas . <p> PHOTO : New Dawn ' tulips tower above a carpet of Pulmonaria saccharata Sissinghurst White ' and blue P. angustifolia . <p> In high summer .
