Maybe you can help out-it seems there ought to be a good punch line to the question " What did the editor say to the former editori " Any good lies escape me . The reality is that when I speak with Kris Rusch lately , I mention to her how busy I am ... and she laughs knowingly . Then I realized that her SF novel Alien Influences and her mainstream novel Hitler 's Angel came out within months of each other , and I learned that the manuscript for Victory , the fifth and final volume of " The Fey " series , requires a ream and a half of paper and I think that laugh of hers is more than just knowing . It 's almost ominous . Fortunately , Kris is not too busy to send an occasional tale our way ... <p> HE TRIES TO REMEMBER . The nurses do n't understand that . They think it odd that he requests audio tapes of the books he has written , videos of the interviews he has given , and photograph albums of times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his last few years , pictures so tiny they rest in the palm of his hand . In them , the people turn like toy dolls , but he can not feel their feet against his skin . Outside the door , he hears the nurses whispering , " Sad old man . He 's got nothing left to live for , so he lives in his past . " Only he does n't have any memories except inconsequential ones : the runny eggs he had for breakfast , the plot of the crime drama he watched the night before on the wide screen television placed at the perfect distance from his bed . He has a superficial knowledge of everything he has done , like a back-of-the-book bio sheet written about someone else : Published his first novel , Golden Sunset , in 1945 . Wrote sixteen Broadway plays , including the Tony Award winning Stations in the Sky 1960 . Published five books of essays , the last an autobiographical sketch .

He had noticed the first one missing on his ninetieth birthday when his daughter , Paula , asked him to recite her favorite bedtime story to his great-grandson . He did not remember telling bedtime stories , and said so . She reminded him of that only this morning , when he asked what day she first noticed his memory slipping . " It 's normal , Dad . The mind goes with age . " But not his mind . His mind has controlled his entire life . He knows that with the same certainty with which he knows he is male . He remembers the feeling of control , but he does not remember the incidents that triggered it . It is the ultimate curse . His body is now so feeble that he can not spend much time out of bed . If he does , the nurses come after him as if he were a child . " Now , now , Mr. Brasher , we must n't hurt ourselves . " He wonders how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - he saw the documentation in the photo album : his younger self standing over the blueprints , holding a hammer , speaking to a contractor . He chose the big brass feather bed , the ruby bedspread with matching carpet and curtains that set off the mahogany paneling . It is soothing to sleep in this room with his books and posters lining the walls , this place he has been for fifty years . It is like living in his own mind . This morning he woke with the thought that the longer he remains passive , the sooner the thief will take his entire being . Until his daughter made her casual remark , he was willing to let his brain slip away drop by drop . But she was wrong . Age should equal wisdom , and somewhere , someone is stealing his wisdom from him . He can not allow this to continue . He needs a plan . A simple plan to prevent the destruction of his mind . A plan that will save the little bit he has left . He reads until he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentence a battle he must fight to the end . He reads only two pages before his head lolls against the pillows . When he awakes , the side of his mouth is wet . He drools in his sleep , like an old man . He hates thinking of himself as old . He has spoken to the nurses . They pat his arm , and refuse to answer him until he gets agitated . They say different doctors have different opinions , but no one will tell him what those opinions are . He investigates various diseases on his own . But , as he reads , and sleeps , and reads some more , he realizes his symptoms are not neatly categorized . He can learn and remember from day to day if he tries . The information he has lost all seems to fit into part of the same whole . He can not remember his work , although he can remember setting pen to paper . But he does not try to write . That drive left him first , as if fleeing from a crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he realizes that detail is a memory . He can pinpoint the day he lost his will to create , pinpoint it without anyone else 's help . He was sitting downstairs in the solarium he built for Olive . She had been dead a year , and in that time , he discovered that the only way he could feel close to her was to sit in that overheated room she loved . He had to hire someone to tend her plants , and even then they did n't look right . But the light coming through the window , that was right and always would be , and he knew if he turned his head just one certain way that he would see her again , that she hid in the periphery of his vision like a car in his blind spot . He knew he should write about the loss as he had written about everything else in his life , record it for some future even he could n't fathom , but for the first time since he knew the alphabet he did n't want to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , first of Olive , then of himself . It was only a short walk from the solarium to the bed . In six months he has become a bed-ridden drooling old man whose emaciated form more resembles a starving man in a magazine ad than the famous , wellphotographed writer , robust from too much good food and not enough exercise . The loss is not related to Olive for he wrote before he knew her and he wrote after she died . No . The loss has a physical cause , and he will find it . On the third day of his quest , he waits until the nurses take their lunch . He can hear a soap opera at high volume in the kitchen , some hapless heroine sobbing about murder in the arms of her lover . He uses the glittering metal knob attached to the plastic headboard to pull himself out of bed . His legs are unsteady , but he manages to traverse the bedroom . The carpet from bed to door seems as long as the Sahara . He has to lean against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he forgotten to eat in those six weeks ? Or did the doctors order some low-calorie fare that failed to nourish him ? All he remembers is burnt toast , cold soup and roast beef sandwiches made mostly of gristle . Whoever hired those nurses did not hire them for their cooking ability . After a few minutes he catches his breath and staggers down the hall , as wobbly as a child taking his first steps . Instantly he gets a picture : Paula toddling toward him , hands outstretched , joy on her pudgy face . He owns that one , and Mary too , balancing herself with one hand on the couch , the other knocking his magazines off the coffee table , Olive 's three-note laugh echoing in the background . He blinks back tears , so grateful to have photographs in his head that he stumbles and nearly falls . He catches the wall to steady himself and listens for heavy nursy footsteps on the stairs , but the television blares coffee percolating music , and after a moment he realizes they are n't going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he stops . The area around it smells faintly of pipe smoke and he catches a glimpse of a memory before it disappears into the recesses of his brain . This room is gone from his head . If he opens the door , he will see a room he designed as if it were assembled by a stranger . He does not know what he will find . The thought fills him with apprehension . Even so , he reaches down and grabs the knob . It turns , but the door does not open . The knob feels strange to his palm . He pulls his hand away . This knob does not match the others in the house . It is square and has a red light pulsing in the center . He recognizes it from the magazine on his bedstand - a private in-house security system , keyed to one person 's specifications . He lets out a silent moan . He must have bought that system and installed it . But he can not remember doing so , nor can he remember the code . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shudder . The television blares menacing music that leads to another set of commercials . The show will end soon . He has to get back to his bed before the nurses find him . As he makes his way back , hand pressed against the wall , he wishes for a cane . Something to lean on to make his passage easier . It is n't until he reaches the Sahara carpet that he thinks to wonder at the lock itself : who was he trying to keep out of his study ? Until he became ill , he lived alone . HE DEMANDS to see the doctors , and the nurses drive him to cold sterile offices : the first on Rodeo Drive near all the exclusive shops . This child with bright red hair , the nurse tells Brasher , is his personal doctor , the person who has treated him for the last sixteen years . Brasher does n't recognize him . Nor does he recognize the waiting room : Empty except for him , filled with blue chairs that matched the blue carpet and the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone has installed a television set in front of each seat , and thoughtfully provided the viewer with a remote . The examining room is even colder than the waiting room . He sits on the gurney with his clothes on , feeling naked nonetheless , wishing he could lie down , but knowing that he should n't . The doctor treats him like a baby , and speaks in that sing-song voice reserved for children , the mentally unstable , and those who do n't speak English . " Sometimes , " the doctor says , " the mind leaves before the body does . I 'm sorry , Reed . I know this is hard for you , but you have enough money . You have lived a full life . Lie back for your remaining years and relax . " The advice of the young . Brasher asks a few more questions , all about the progression of the doctor 's version of Brasher 's disease , and learns that it matches his memories of himself : the quick onset ( rare , the doctor says ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but understandable , given the loss of your wife ) . The doctor-child 's eyes have no understanding , however , and Brasher wants to demand how the doctor would feel if it were his mind , his life , being eroded away bit by tiny bit . But he does not . He did not come for compassion . He came for answers . He has received neither . The second doctor 's office is in a clinic on the revitalized section of Hollywood Boulevard . The clinic has a large sign over the door which announces a specialty in geriatric services . The waiting room is designed for people his daughter 's age : Elvis Presley blues on the speakers , books line the walls , and photographs of Hollywood in the fifties and sixties rest beneath the glass on the coffee table . He does not feel old here : he feels ancient , as if he should have died years ago . This doctor is a woman in her forties , the age of his granddaughter Kimberly . The woman is not attractive : middle age has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her buttocks . She , at least , has compassion . It appears to be what has wearied her . Since they are alone , she sits across from him in the waiting room , a file folder clasped to her chest like a shield , and tells him in a gentle voice that some people become children in their old age . " I am not a child , " he says . " I simply can not remember my life . " They discuss his symptoms . She agrees that he has no classic symptoms for any disease which attacks the mind . But she reminds him that no one is classic , and that even now , no one understands the human brain . " Except the computer programmers , " he says , thinking he is making a joke . Sitting in this room designed to ease people younger than he is has put him on edge . The doctor starts . She has obviously not expected his joke . Finally she smiles . " I believe the computer people are working on artificial intelligence , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their discussion . She sends for his nurse/chauffeur and then touches his hand before she leaves the room . " You are more fortunate than some , Mr. Brasher , " she says , that compassion enveloping him like a hug . " You at least wrote about your life . Perhaps you knew this time would come all along . " Her words send a chill through him and he remembers , oh , so briefly remembers how it felt to be young and whole and in control of his world . " No , " he says to her . " I did not know this would happen , but I was afraid it would . " He sleeps , on and off , for the two days after his excursion , and each time he awakes , he curses the exhaustion that will not leave him . He wants to think , but finds it tiring and so he sleeps instead . On the morning of the third day , he wakes with a restlessness it takes him a while to identify : it is energy . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has an idea . The female doctor 's words have echoed through his dreams : he needs an intelligence specialist . Computer experts have studied the mind for most of his life . He will have someone make a map of the deterioration of his brain . He knows just the person to do it . He picks up the phone beside his bed , hits the speed dial button marked with his nephew Scott 's name , and asks - no , demands - that Scott join him for dinner . Scott 's voice holds the tolerance one gives to the eccentric in the family , tolerance touched with urgency , with the knowledge that he might not have discussions with his uncle Reed much longer . Brasher recognizes the tone : his voice has held it too , but for whom and when he can not remember . He closes his eyes in frustration and hopes enough of his mind will be left by dinner so that he can have a meaningful , life-saving conversation with his sister 's son . The man who eats from the tray at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person who is crossing the threshold of old age . He is balding , and his features are wide and square . The cartilage in his nose has softened , flattening it against his jowly face . Only the eyes are familiar . bright and green and shining with intelligence . The nurses have served roast beef obviously carved in a grocery store deli , gravy from a can , and mashed potatoes made from a mix . The preservatives give everything a flat flavor , except the potatoes , which have a gritty taste all their own . Scott eats carefully , flattening his potatoes so they melt into the gravy and pushing the gelatinous mess away from his roast beef . He will not look at Reed . " It happens to everyone , Unc . " Scott 's right hand has lumpish knuckles and an age spot near the wrist . " We all get old . " " No , " Reed says . " No one else in my family lost their mind . " " Aunt Olive did , at the end , remember ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife 's personality simply died before her body did . " We were not related by blood , " he says , gently . Scott smiles and for the first time , Reed sees the boy he remembers trapped in the man 's body . " I know that . But they think now that sometimes things like this happen because of environment . You two went everywhere together . " Reed shakes his head . " This is different . I 've been reading - " he sweeps his hand at the bookshelf " - and my symptoms are unique . " He clears his throat , runs his hand through his thinning hair , feeling the baldness pattern that is an advanced version of his nephew 's . " I need your help . I want you to do a map of the deterioration of my brain . " Scott 's eyes widen , and for a moment , color brushes his cheeks . He sets his fork down , brings the linen napkin to his mouth , and wipes . His hand shakes . Then he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't done any programming since college . " Reed frowns . " But computers are your specialty . " Scott shakes his head . " No . I play with computers , but I use other people 's programs . Besides , this would take knowledge I do n't have . " Reed slumps against his pillows . Even the thought that his knowledge of Scott comes from the memory of a boy instead of the reality of a man does not make him feel any better . Reed stares at the sheet , folded against the thick red comforter , the white cotton smudged with a dab of gravy . " It feels as if a shadow is creeping across my brain , " he says . " If we can shed light on it , then perhaps it will go away . " Scott puts his tray on the floor and buries his face in his hands . Reed glances at his nephew . They were close once , when Scott played with Reed 's children at all the family gatherings , but there seems to be little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's reaction . Finally Scott brings his head up , his eyes hooded and unreadable , an expression so like Reed 's father that Reed starts . " All right , Unc , " Scott says . " I know a man who can help you . I 'll send him over tomorrow and we 'll see what he can do.Et The man 's name is Cielo Rodriguez , but he speaks no Spanish . " My mother chose the name , " is all he will say , which puts his birthdate squarely within a five-year period that began in 1966 . He is tall and slender , with wavy black hair and piercing blue eyes - a bit of cielo , he says - but Reed is uncertain whether the man means the sky or heaven . Rodriguez wears white to set off his dark skin . Thick corded muscle runs up his arms and into his shoulders , as if working with computers has made him very strong . He answers Reed 's early questions as if he has answered them a thousand times . They meet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him in bed . The warmth is a comfort for his old and aching bones . The nurses have put a stool in front of his favorite chair so that he can rest his feet . Even in his white shirt and lightweight pants , Rodriguez looks hot . Sweat beads on his forehead , an occasional drop falling off his brow onto his pristine clothes . Reed does not like the small talk and doubts he ever had patience for it . He leans forward , his shoulder brushing a fem , and tells Rodriguez the brief history of his deterioration , then requests the map . Rodriguez wipes at a trickle of sweat that has fallen onto his cheek . " Frankly , " he says , " I am surprised you have come back to us . " Reed feels a little chill in the pit of his stomach . " Come back ? " " We did this five years ago , " Rodriguez says with the cautious tone Reed is coming to recognize . " Both you and your wife . It was a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the working , intelligent human brain . Made the cover of Science News and Scientific American . " And I ca n't believe you do n't remember . That is what his tone said . How could you ever forget ? Reed 's breath is coming in small gasps . No wonder Scott looked so upset . The first time they probably sought him out . The second time , he sought them . " If I 'd known you were having troubles , I 'd have come to you , " Rodriguez says . " Just like we did for your wife . " " You made a second map of Olive ? " Reed 's voice rasps . His throat has tightened against the words . Rodriguez shakes his head . " She would n't let us touch her again . " Reed does n't move . He can feel Olive 's presence all around him . The warmth envelops him like a hug . Sometimes things like this happen because of environment . You two went everywhere together . Or shared the same experiment . " Could this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reed asks . He does not look at Rodriguez , focusing instead on the small hothouse rose blooming on the third shelf to his left . " No . " Rodriguez leans forward into Reed 's line of vision . Rodriguez places his face so that his piercing gaze meets Reed 's . " We have done this technique a hundred times since and have used it as a diagnostic tool . No one else has had this problem . " Reed can not look into that tiny bit of cielo . He turns away . " You sound awfully certain for a man who is experimenting . " " You used to like my certainty , " Rodriguez says . The words make Reed start . Another thing lost ? He can not tell . Rodriguez stands . He pats Reed 's shoulder with a familiarity that strangers should not have . " Come to Cedar Sinai tomorrow at nine Am. and report to Neurology . We will have your new map in no time . " " Tomorrow , " Reed whispers . The promise hangs in the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppressive as if , in its weight , lingers Olive 's disapproval . THEY BEGIN WITH old-fashioned technologies , X-rays , an MRI , a PET and an AAL . Then they take him into a room he believes he has never seen before . This test has no acronym . He is placed on a divan , one of three in a room the size of his master bathroom . A technician places a device shaped like a hairdryer in a 1950s beauty salon over his head . His neck is held in place by a soft cushion . He is encouraged to close his eyes , but he is asked not to sleep . He can not sleep anyway . The room is air-conditioner cold , the kind of dry chill that seeps into his bones and brings goosebumps to his skin . Two people monitor him from the booth above-both women . He has not seen Rodriguez all morning . All night he dreamed of Olive as she had been when he met her , her black hair held in rolls by ornate combs , her lipstick thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a vitality that drew him like a thirsty man to water . At first he was happy , because he had found another untapped memory . They made love in a private rail car as it bumped and thudded along a steel track , their moans lost in the clatter . Then everything went dark , and he heard her voice , faint and quivering with age : It 's wrong , Reed . Please . Do n't ask me again . As he closes his eyes now , he hears that voice , gone now almost two years and still buried inside him . Do n't ask me . Please , Reed . Please . He has a sense of disquiet , as if the dreams have told him something he should understand . He allows his mind to free associate , as the technicians have told him to . He is not asleep , but he is not awake , either . Finally the answer comes to him , firmly and with strength , his mind speaking with confidence for the first time since this ordeal began . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has been trying too hard . He needs to remember with his body , not with his mind . This test is done , and the techs take him to another room , attach him to another machine . He barely notices ; he is too engaged reviewing his small store of memories . The wobble of his legs brought back the children ; the warmth of the solarium brought him Olive . Other memories are subtler : the taste of canned gravy brought the years of his young marriage and the boy Scott to his mind ; the expression in Scott 's eyes reviving for a brief instant Reed 's father . The body is a link to a secondary store of memories , one he accesses in a different way than simple recall . They complete two more tests before lunch . After lunch , the techs warn him , is the frightening part . They assure him he will feel nothing . They take him to another white room , this one with a lounge and a series of wires hanging over it , like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , explaining in a cheery voice that he has been through this once before . He has minute scars to prove it . Then she uses a tiny needle to inject a solution into his skull . She is right ; he feels nothing . Occasionally he makes an involuntary movement - a toe wiggles , a finger twitches - but otherwise he seems to be in control of himself . Over lunch , the techs tried to explain the process to him , using words like Virtual Imaging and Composite Mapping , but the jargon passes him too quickly . He will have Rodriguez explain , later . When she finishes , she takes him to a room and lets him sleep - a much needed , dreamless rest . He does not see Rodriguez until the following morning . Reed is still exhausted . They meet in Rodriguez 's office , a cramped room piled with print-outs and curling photographs , X-rays , and photographs of the brain . Computers hum on three desks . Framed degrees proclaim Rodriguez a medical doctor as well as a computer scientist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered with bookshelves . If Reed squints , he can see the Scientific American cover with the map of his brain . The same map rises from the surface of one of the desks . A holographic projection . Reed half-smiles . An old memory must have led him to expect the map on one of the computer screens . A similar map rises from another desk . Rodriguez stares at them as if they hold secrets he can not fathom . The light from the maps reflects on his face , making his dark skin as pale as his clothes . " I have never seen anything like this , " he says . Reed has to fight to concentrate on the words . The exhaustion and strain have made him dizzy . He leans forward , ignoring the complaints of his back . " Look . " Rodriguez swivels the two models so that they face Reed . " You 're right . You are losing information , but the loss is not starting in the corner of one lobe and moving in the other direction . Instead it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it is searching for particular kinds of information . It is as if these areas are washed clean . " He turns and faces Reed . The light from the maps shines over Rodriguez 's shoulders , giving him a halo . " If this is a disease , it is unlike anything we have ever seen before . " Reed frowns . " Are you saying I 'm all right ? i " " No . " Rodriguez temples his fingers . " Something is clearly wrong . The links remain - you can relearn things , but the knowledge you 've stored is gone , and that knowledge seems to be specialized . With more time , we can figure out what areas are being affected . " " Today ? " Reed asks . Rodriguez shakes his head . " You 're too tired . A week from now . Will that work for you ? " Reed nods . Then asks the question he has been thinking since the day before . " Is this what happened to Oliver " " We do n't know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns slightly , so that he can look at the screen instead of Reed . " She would not let us map her brain before she died , and she insisted that no one touch it after . You cremated her so that we would all comply with her wishes . " Reed stares at the revolving brains before him . The second is webbed with thin lines not in the first , as if someone has poured a dark liquid into the blood vessels to touch up the shadows . It is as if Death has snuck inside him and is snuffing out his life , inch by painful inch . He sleeps for another two days . The sheets in the bed are damp from his sweat . His pillow feels hard and once he dreams he is trapped in an old CT machine , a room-sized monstrosity that sucks him dry . On the third day , he awakens with a sense of loss . He runs through his feeble store of memories and stumbles . When he wobbled down the hall days before , he uncovered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His head hurts with the strain of looking for it ; his mind plays with the emptiness like the tongue plays with the space left by a missing tooth . He even gets out of bed and wobbles a bit , hoping the memory will return . But it is gone , like the others , perhaps forever . A terror shudders through him , quick as alcohol on an empty stomach . He should not lose memories he has struggled to recover . Even Rodriguez said his brain was fine . The new memories should stay . With a shaking hand , Reed reaches for the phone and calls Rodriguez . All Reed gets is Rodriguez 's automated voice , urging him to leave a message . Which he does . All garbled and fear-filled , sounding more like a hysterical old man than he has ever sounded in his memory , as paltry as it is . Then he gets out of bed , determined to try the hall again , to see if recreating the same circumstances will bring the memory back . He grips the plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not that bad . A brass bed should have a brass board . Someone must have changed it . He does not know why . As he crosses the Sahara carpet , each step is slow and uncertain . Even though he feels he has made some progress with his mind , his body 's deterioration continues . His hands , outstretched before him for balance , are thin and bony , their flesh loose and lined with oversized blue veins . When he reaches the door 's threshold , he grips it and leans into the hallway . The television blares below : the CNN news theme this time . If he were to cry for help , the nurses would never hear him . He turns back to the hallway itself , wide enough for a wheelchair , filled with polished occasional tables and framed art that once had meaning for him . Keeping one hand firmly pressed against the dry wall , he takes small baby steps , then stops . This was the place he had the memory . He remembers the moment of recovery , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had recaptured part of himself . Odd that he can recall remembering but the memory itself is gone . He inches closer to the wall and rests his head on the back of his hand . Little shudders run through him . Someday it will all be gone and he will be a great hulking empty shell of loose skin and brittle bones . As Olive had been . She left before her body did , but where she went he had no idea . A tiny thread of despair fills him . She never left him before without telling him where she was going to go . Another memory . But he knows it is not the same as the one he has lost . And this new memory has come through his body again , through the tactile image of a vacant shell . He can not see Olive 's dead body , but he remembers how it felt-like a beloved robe tossed on a bed- threadbare , worn , full of memories , but empty without its owner . " Mr. Brasher ? " He starts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against his arm , her uniform smelling of perfumed laundry detergent and sweat . " You need to be in bed , Mr. Brasher . " He glances at her - rounded cheeks and chocolate eyes . She is younger than he realized , perhaps twenty-five , but already set in a middleaged body . Her voice has a warmth she does not have to fake , and her breath is laced with garlic . He has succumbed to this gentle persuasion before . Then he looks down the hall . Only a few feet remain to his study . The red light on the door knob blinks . " I know , " he says , " but I need to do this more . " He pushes away from the wall and almost loses his balance . She places a firm hand on the small of his back to steady him . He walks without support now , embarrassed by his old man 's gait . After he walks a few steps , he hears a sharp intake of breath . She must have realized where he is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go in there . " He stops in front of the study door . The faint aroma of pipe tobacco brings up a wistfulness in him . He gazes at the tiny blinking light reflecting off the translucent skin of his right arm . " If I ca n't go in there , " he says , " who can ? " She apparently has no answer . He closes his eyes and grips the knob . The corners bite into his skin . The metal is cool beneath his palm , except in the center , where the light blinks . He has felt this before . His own voice speaks in his head and he repeats the words , the quote he chose to release the lock : " ' Go then ! Go to the moon , you selfish dreamer ! " " And he hears not his own voice , but a raspy female voice in a room tinged with whiskey , the words echoing across a stage , and sees a young girl , dressed in white , the spotlight on her hand , cupping a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then what he has lost : that magic , that music perfection could raise in him : the tears he cried when he first saw Ibsen and Williams and O'Neill performed upon the stage , the glimmer of inspiration that made him want to do the same things . He remembers the feel of the velvet-covered steel theater chair , the collective gasp of the audience , the instinctive grasping in his soul that made him want to achieve uniformity of emotion in a hundred people sitting in the dark . He is so lost inside himself that he does not notice as the knob slips through his grasp . Only the cool hand upon his arm brings him to the present . " Come inside , old man , " says a voice he recognizes . " It 's time we talk . " It takes a moment for his eyes to focus . As they do , he finds himself gazing at skin so flawless that it lacks the visible imperfections of open pores or bristly whiskers . The lips are smooth , a rosy hue he has never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing the slight bump it had had since a skiing accident ; the eyes white and green in perfect contrast , untouched by exposed vessels or deep circles in the lid below . Only the hair seems familiar , dark and black and thick , smooth in the front and slightly upraised in the back as if hands have been running through it in a nervous gesture . He has not seen that face in sixty-five years-except on jacket covers , retrospectives and the wedding photograph that hangs above the mantle in the library on the first floor . For a moment , he ca n't breathe . The lump in his throat is so thick he can barely swallow . He can only stare - up - at the man he once was . And it all clicks into place . Even though he does n't remember , he knows . " I should n't have to invite you in , " the replica of his younger self says and steps back . But Reed can not move . The voice is half a step off - that odd timbre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from within and without . The man - the boy - before him is the age of his greatgrandchildren , from an age when the body is lithe and beautiful , unmarked and unmarred by time . A flush warms him . How odd it feels to look at his former perfection , to know that the broad-shouldered , slim-hipped body before him became this bowed , broken and bent thing that can barely stand on its own . " Please , " the boy says . Reed glances back at the nurse . She is watching with her hands pressed together in unconscious imitation of prayer , her fingertips pushing against her chin . He can not bear the look of pity and concern on her face . He steps inside and closes the door . The room brings up no memories in him , although the pungent scent of tobacco makes it feel like home . A large oak desk dominates . Its position beneath the floor-to-ceiling windows makes it the center of the room . Papers are scattered across its surface , next to a dust-covered typewriter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a laptop hums . Small swinging doors lead into another room , and he knows without looking that it houses a small kitchen with an even smaller bedroom beyond . Artwork and photographs are scattered along the floor as if someone meant to hang them up . His books , plays , and other published works fill the bookshelves , and the bookshelves dominate , running from floor to ceiling . Over and over , his name appears , in Times Roman , Geneva , and Palatino in gold , blue and bright green : J. Reed Brasher . A constant reoccurring image to remind him who he was . Richard Nanes 's Nocturnes of the Celestial Seas plays softly in the background , the rhapsodic , richly chorded Nocturne in C Major evoking a melancholy in him he had n't realized he is feeling . He built all of this and he remembers none of it . " Did Cielo Rodriguez help design you ? " he asks , his back to the boy . The boy laughs . That sound , at least , is familiar . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Cielo Rodriguez merely laid the groundwork . He knows nothing of the project . You hired RoboTechs to make me , and had them work with a designer in Hamburg , and a young woman whose work shook the world of artificial intelligence . Seventeen tries to come up with me . " Seventeen sounds like too few to create the perfection before him . Too easy . He staggers to the couch and sits beside the laptop . He brushes the keyboard , finds the keys molded to the shape of his fingers . He knows he created all of this so that he would be immortalized , so that he would not die at the end of a normal human life span , but somehow , now , it seems vainglorious . " And Olive ! " he whispers . " She died before the project was finished . " Reed looks up . This - boy - is the only person who does not speak to him in that sing-song voice of tolerance . He answers the questions as if they are normal , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memories . " The words rush out of Reed in a gut of anger he does not know he has . His mind has controlled his entire life , and now this artificial person - this thing- is taking his mind from him . " I do not know how a man can steal from himself , " the boy says . Reed looks at the boy , really looks at him . He is Reed and not Reed . The lump on the nose that Olive used to trace with her finger , the scar beneath the lower lip , the hint of acne that bothered him until he was thirty-five , all missing . The boy 's knuckles have lines , but his hands do not-not even the tiny wrinkles Reed used to create by arching his fingers backwards as far as they would go . " You are not me , " Reed says . " No , " the boy responds , " but I will be when the transfer is done . " His dream was prophetic then - or memory perhaps - the bed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life from him tidbit by tidbit , idea by idea . Reed 's breathing is labored . He understands his own rationale . His mind controls , so move the mind and he will continue to live . He hates this old man 's body , hates its lack of mobility , its constant pain , its systematic failures , but it is his body , and trapped within it are the indelible imprints of a life well lived . He clenches his fists and holds them in his lap . " You ca n't kill me , " the boy says . " They 'll just reactivate me when you leave . " Reed swallows . His mouth is dry , his tongue pasted to the back of his teeth . Kill the boy ? Destroy the machine that holds all of his memories ? Surely he did n't expect himself to be as crazy as that ? Still , the anger has nowhere to go . He is an old man whose body shakes when he stands . He licks his lips , wishing for strength in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , " he says . The boy sits across from him , the body long and easy in a chair that never housed anything so young . " Had to , " he says . " There are bugs in the system . " Reed runs his fingers across his balding pate . He does not want to help this usurper self , this idealized version of the person he once was . His mistake was to think that the boy 's future would be his future , a thought he can not even remember having , but knows he had . Still the questing mind , ever his savior and his betrayer , forces the question from his lips : " What sort of bugs ? " The boy reaches back , gathers papers off the messy desk top , and hands them over , like a young student awaiting his teacher 's approval . Reed takes them , his own hand curved and shaking , skin wrinkled and spotted and pocked , without a trace of perfection . He knows where the drive has gone now . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pages , then reads , curious to see what his mind has created without him . The words are smooth , the rhythm and style his . He feels the logic of the grammar , recognizes the vocabulary . But the emptiness shocks him . He saw better papers when he taught the occasional writing class . The boy leans close and watches Reed . Bugs in the system . Reed sighs . Yes , of course . He would have wanted everything . Continued life and continued success . But there can be no success with only pretty words . Does n't the boy understand that ? There are no characters , no emotions . The heart Reed was praised for is missing as if it never had been . He gazes up at the boy and sees not distress in those green eyes , but a curiosity , as if the boy believes Reed can give him the piece of the puzzle that will make him whole . " I need to study these , " Reed says , and stands . His legs wobble beneath him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man would catch a child . The memory returns : Paula , stumbling as she almost reaches him , her baby legs shaking and uncertain . His hand - scratched , scabbed and callused but young- reaches for her to steady her . Not quite what he had in the hall : close , but different . He has to get out of here . Now . He rolls the papers and staggers forward , more a drunk than a baby , lurching toward the door . He will not go back to the bed . Finally he understands the plastic headboard . This leaching of memory will have to quit . And be reversed . If they can pull the ideas from him , they can put them back . " Please , " the boy says , and there is a desperation in his tone . " Please . If you leave now , you wo n't come back . " Damn right , Reed almost says , but does n't . Confusion makes him dizzy . This is his project after all . He understands the logic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An information transfer of this magnitude could not occur after death . But he never guessed how it would feel - or that it would fail . He stumbles and the boy catches him with a tenderness he does not expect . The toughness from earlier must have been programmed in , a planned response to questions Reed thought he might ask . The boy 's hands are cool and smooth , not quite human , but he eases Reed back to the couch as if Reed were more precious than gold . " Please , " the boy says again . " What am I doing wrong ? " That , at least , is right . The questing mind which has never left him . Never left him , yet is replicated in the boy . An idea blossoms , but he ignores it , allowing it to rise to fruition without the help of his conscious brain . Instead he touches the boy 's cheeks , feels the down of invisible hairs , the jut of the cheekbones , the oddly perfected nose . After a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face , fingers tracing the wrinkles and grooves carved by time . Reed can not tell the boy what is missing , because it has taken Reed until this moment to realize what is there : the mind is more than the brain , more than chemicals and neural pathways carved in gray matter . Memories live in each cell , branded as deeply as time has branded his skin . Reed can stop the theft as easily as he started it - and he will . For he can never recreate himself . He was right about seventeen being too fewand he has not time for hundreds . Even then , the mind will not be whole . It will not know , really know , how Olive 's skin felt beneath his fingertips or how her voice resonated in his ears . The scent of pipe tobacco will not bring with it the smell of home , and the brush of fingers against the arm will not recall his co-mingled joy and fear at his first child 's first steps . His body holds those memories and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his body , no trick of science can pull them free . He lets go of the boy 's face , and glances at the laptop . It is not his , even though it is made for him . He eases off the couch and heads for the desk , pulling the heavy , dusty typewriter toward him . His hands shake no longer , and , as he rolls a sheet of paper into the platen , he smiles just a little . For the drive has returned , along a different pathway , inspired not by the passions of someone else 's life , but by the passions of his own . Passions no one , not even the perfected figure in front of him , will experience in the same way again . Passions recorded in the books on the wall . His passions , his life , in his words , already transferred from the deepest parts of his being , from the wounds and the scars no doctor has ever seen . His daughter , the doctors , his nephew , they are all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loss will not be his . It will be theirs . Someday he will follow Olive to a place he has never seen . He looks at the boy , and now the quizzical expression in the boy 's eye pleases him . " I ca n't teach you how to put your heart and soul on the page , " Reed says , his voice firm . " I 've never been able to teach anybody that . But I can show you how it 's done . " His fingers fit on the dusty keys , but he does not type . The boy can type . Instead Reed tilts his head back and feels the ideas come together . A surge of adrenaline fills him as it always has at the instant of creation . The boy looks over his shoulder , waiting but Reed does not explain . He does not have to . He has never written to teach . He writes for the sheer joy of placing himself on the page.t In memory of Kathryn Rusch " Let 's see now ... we took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed to the " QB " at Canal Street ...
