ContentsSuzi 's Tale * * * # This collaboration by George Guthridge and Inner Berliner is one of the strangest stories we 've ever published . We suggest that you read this story first , and then come back to the introduction . <p> All right ? Good . Now , to answer the question some of you may have : George is alive and well and living in Alaska with his new wife . He is teaching and writing ; he has received national recognition for both . <p> Janet Berliner 's writing and editing career has taken off . She has recently edited two well-received anthologies , one with David Copperfield and the other with Peter Beagle , and has just started a third , with Joyce Carol Oates . <p> I 'll tell this like suzi 's heart , cold and hard . Like the land I love . <p> Eating , she and I , at Fat Freddie 's , amid Iditarod frenzy . Anticipation of the buzzer announcing another musher finishing the race suffuses everything like grease from the kitchen , where dishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ate here last , lemon pudding pockmarked like the moon . <p> I focus across the frozen sea , aware that Suzi is avoiding my eyes  --  though not out of respect . Have I again offended a friend ? Socially I am clumsy as a new snowshoer . <p> Out on the ice , golfers in parkas putt amid planted evergreens and cardboard cutouts of moose wavering in the wind . A diamond-shaped , silver-orange sun . Thank the heavens Western Alaska is cruel . Usually keeps Outsiders away , else views be ruined by those who think the warmth of wintry sun can be captured by a Kodak . <p> Tourists again have descended , like bullflies in summer . Granola types , this time of year , desperate to fit into a world they have not earned . Braided ponytails on both sexes . They compare REI coats , discuss proper North Face pitons , ogle Eskimo ivory , perform swing steps that shame the locals . <p> Suzi seems not to care about the Iditarod . Sullen . Body language angular and brittle as shelf ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frozen sea . <p> I have lived too long in the Arctic . <p> I have lived too long . <p> Other than the occasional sweet but ephemeral release through writing fiction or by attending weekday Mass during summers Outside , my only real peace the time in the mental ward near ' Frisco . <p> I know too well the cool calm of a shotgun beneath the chin . <p> " You never use your Eskimo name , " she says morosely . <p> " I 'm no wannabe "  --  accepting a $3.50 milkshake from the waitress . " Besides , I have difficulty pronouncing it . " Feeling undignified as usual , I drink from the metal cup , straw against cheek . " Everyone laughs when I say it . " <p> " I would n't laugh . " <p> The sadness in her voice is compelling . <p> " Suklugraq , " I tell her . <p> She laughs . Bitterly . <p> " Parakeet-auklet , " she says . " No wonder everyone laughs . Who in God 's name gave you a name like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Your national academic champions ? But those kids loved you ! They used to say you 're half Eskimo . " <p> " I 'm the man without a culture , remember ? " <p> She orders three coffees , a steaming triad . Plain , mocha , amaretto . Saves waitress-waiting , she told me once , without amusement . <p> Hiding behind the milkshake feedbag , I ask , " Go to the B.O.T. later ? " <p> Desultory shake of her head , hair flipping , black gold . She knows why I suggest the bar . Get her drunk , she 'll want me . Sexually . Socially . <p> She has n't been soused in years . Not even a tippler anymore , I do n't think . <p> I stare outside , ashamed of the suggestion . I 'm a social climber , climbing down . Ladder descending beneath the sea . <p> Too many winter nights . <p> Long silence , in a land and among people where silence is valued , but not this time . Maybe the other teachers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not without reason . The kids are studying too much , they said ; you 're pushing too hard . And I  --  feeling cornered back then , wanting only to cover my head with my hands and arms . Cower . And cry . <p> " I 'm sorry , " I mutter . " I did n't mean ... " <p> We both know I 'm lying . <p> " You 're never mean . You just do n't think . Your white half coming through , I guess . " <p> She touches my wrist . Fingertips like lambskin . I nearly shiver , despite her warmth and the kitchen heat . We avoid each other 's eyes . <p> " Order up ! " snaps the cook . Reed-thin body and voice . <p> Fat Freddie does n't cook anymore . <p> " Suklugraq , " she says softly . " I need to tell you something . About names . And little men . I need to understand . " <p> I want to beg off  --  I 'm in no mood for a diatribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poet both in heart and in fact . <p> Her fingers remain on my wrist . And I have been , oh , so long without a woman in my bed , much less my life . <p> " My people would laugh at me for not understanding , " she says . " And your people  --  since when do they understand anything ? But the kids ... they say your heart smiles even though you 're forever frowning . " <p> What heart I have  --  sinks . Why ca n't she want me for me ? My caring constantly defined not by self or even culture , but by career : t teaching that has brought such fame , such misfortune , such unfulfillment . <p> The teacher in me rises and settles , awaiting another deluge . <p> She begins , this Suzi of downcast eyes and hair rich as Alaskan oil . <p> " Once upon a time " ( she says to a plastic tablecloth stained with coffee and puckered with cigarette burns ) " there lived a King Islander ... let 's call her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delphina Kasgnoc . " Now she looks at me , eyes cold . " As I am daughter of John Muktoyuk and Delphina Kasgnoc . Granddaughter of Utamana , who first said ' the sea is our garden . ' Iilana , who survived forty-four days out on the ice . Aalik , who refused to speak the name Pilgrim River missionaries gave people like yellow stickles on refrigerators . Mugigtag , the greatest King Island storyteller . " <p> What a fool . Am I. <p> I have descended another rung beneath the sea . Though lacking eagle feather and sage , she is invoking the protocol of a talking circle . Here in Fat Freddie 's , in a town where surely no one has said anything important since before buildings popped up like molars through the gray , gold-laden sand , she is about to speak not of heartbreak but of her soul . <p> " Like most King Islanders , Gwen lived here in Nome . She divided her time between creating non-traditional ivory carvings during winter and diving for gold during summer .... " <p> Suzi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , not only for her gold diving but also because she was a virgin . The latter brought her a certain notoriety . She was called a prick-tease though she was anything but , since she informed her dates of her boundaries . Their frustrations might be less if they stopped before the embracing began . Ski pants , kuspuk , sweat pants and bra could come off , but the red panties stayed . Some boys swore they were glued on . <p> She wished she could live a normal life , but she had resolved to be true to the voice of the loon  --  the sacred loon  --  that had come to her in a dream . Make the man with the snow-white face your first lover , the voice called to her one masturbatory winter-solstice night , the eve of her thirteenth birthday . The demand so shook her yet filled her with awe that she kept her unvoiced promise despite her classmates ' laughter and derision . <p> Not that she did n't wonder about the voice and message . Was it truly a loon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or literal ? She began attending Mass more regularly , watching the priest 's face for signs of purity . And Mr. Denbar at school , who talked from behind her while looking down her sweatshirt . He bragged about having been to Hawaii four times in two years  --  but still he was pale as a ghost . <p> She felt walled up . She was sure that she was crazy , that outside the cell of her mind there were no real snow-white men . <p> How long , she wondered , would this imprisonment last ? <p> During January of the year after high school , she missed a period and sensed a new sentence was beginning . <p> On Valentine 's Day she trudged against the wind to Bering Straits Health ; her virginity and her pregnancy were confirmed . The father , a fifth-year senior  --  never mind who he is  --  seemingly had produced sperm whose swimming prowess equaled his in the Nome-Beltz pool . Whether the sperm had slipped through her panties as though through a sieve , or one sperm pulled aside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's guess . <p> As she walked home , wind buffeting her back , the voice returned . She did not look around , not wanting to give the voice the satisfaction of her fear . She had given too much satisfaction lately . <p> Her mother proved gleeful over the prospect of a grandchild . <p> Her father slammed her head against a hollow-core door . Not because he minded the pregnancy but because she would not reveal the name of the boy who had impregnated her . <p> She said nothing . The boy , she decided , was not the father . <p> His sperm  --  not his spirit . <p> The child belonged to the snowy-faced man who had possessed her mind but never the rest of her . <p> Weeks passed , her silence deepened , and when breakup came she loaded her neoprene drysuit and power-jet unit into her Datsun and headed north before the tourists did . <p> God and gold would bring the child good fortune . <p> She took no safety-man . She and her father had served that function for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job to fuel the compressor , not the other 's anger . Diving for gold alone is foolhardy ; doing so in the Arctic is insane . The thought made her drive faster . <p> The previous August , she had done preliminary sniping in a backwash where the Pilgrim escapes the Teller Hills . The river had a gradient of thirty feet per mile , ideal for placer gold , with only a six to eight foot overburden over slate-phyllite bedrock . The bend cut the stream at ninety degrees . <p> A gold-diver 's dream . <p> Get in and get out , she told herself as she reached eighty-seven mile . <p> Just like the boys had wanted to do . <p> She chuckled bitterly , backed the Yamaha 350 off the trailer , packed up , went jouncing across niggerhead tundra and then down the washes and into willow thickets , branches slapping the machine . A snowy owl winged into the air , so startling her that she let go of the throttle and accidentally killed the engine . Was that , she wondered as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mythical man ? <p> Then the river was suddenly before her  --  you know how that happens in Alaska  --  burbling as it snaked among willows , surprisingly shallow despite the spring runoff . For the first time in months , she felt at ease . <p> The hordes of beat-up pinks were gone , but the other color was still there , clear even among the silt . Along the cutbanks , what appeared to be gold sparkled in the breaking morning light . Iron pyrite . She knew that placer gold never sparkles , but rather looks like dull , dirty , hammered brass ; so at first she had been hesitant to snipe this section of the stream . Surely some novice would long ago have displaced the overburden and scoured the crevices , a fool after fool 's gold . <p> Yet the crevices had appeared pristine , and she had ended up with enough in her sample bottles to pay for gas , truck insurance , three bags of groceries at AC  --  which is saying a lot . <p> Perhaps the pyrite had kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tourists . <p> She set up camp on a sandbar , thinking of when June would arrive and the mosquitoes and no-see-ums descend . Then she 'd maintain roaring fires , sucking in the little fuckers . She hated bug dope and Skin-So-Soft . <p> A quarter mile below camp , where the river deepened to a dozen feet , she launched her compressor . A four-banger . She had wrapped its styrofoam billets in duct tape and fiberglazed them to keep them from deteriorating . She secured the platform by rope to fat willows on each side of the pool . <p> The next morning she donned the drysuit and , following a crevice that slanted toward midstream , discovered a gold trap beneath the overburden . She surfaced , pulled the regulator from her mouth , and yelped so joyfully that a magpie trotted from the beach . She removed her mask and , trailing the air hose , slogged onto shore . <p> She was seated on a rock , examining the gold she had tweezered into her sample bottles , when the thicket rustled . <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that granola who heliocoptered into backcountry  --  that woman who poo-pooed warnings about packing a weapon and ended up playing dead while a griz chewed off everything from the biceps down . <p> That 's why real Alaskans enter wilderness well-armed . <p> She chided herself for leaving her ought-six and twelve gauge at camp . And the .44 Magnum she usually kept close ? <p> Left , in the delirium of gold fever , in her dresser in Nome . <p> Only one thing to do . Head for the depths and hope the bear did not feel like fishing . <p> Then she realized the movement was too subtle for a big animal , despite a griz 's grace . Maybe porcupine or wolverine . <p> Out from the willows stepped a dwarf dressed in a tattered sealskin coat , who swung a lariat and lassoed her . <p> She lurched back , but was jerked from the rock . He dragged her across wet sand . Fighting unsuccessfully to free herself , she scrambled to her feet and ran at him , intending to head-butt the little bastard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , strong despite seeming flimsy , and still connected to the compressor , betrayed her . She was yanked from her feet . <p> Darkness drank her .... <p> When she awakened , rope bound her arms . She was still on the sand , the compressor stuttering . Liquid too warm for water trickled down her forehead . <p> " You hit a rock , " a looning voice said . <p> In pain , she squinted up at spindly naked legs , knobby-kneed and bowed like those of some elders , a yellowish penis peeking from under the coat . The sleeves were gone . The dwarf had gray-brown , misshapened arms . <p> She stared at the face . The mouth was scabbed as if with cold sores or frostbite . The rest of the fishbelly-white face was gone . A lump of nose . Empty eye sockets . <p> Had she been less afraid , she would have shuddered in sympathy , for she knew the reason for what seemed a mask . <p> Nitric acid . Regardless of her father 's warnings , when testing gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reverse . Dead flesh still mottled her forearm from the splatters . <p> The dwarf 's face looked like it had been knocked into a nitric-filled gold pan . <p> Now she sensed who he was . One of the Cingssiik , the Little People . Although born and raised in Nome , she belonged to King Island , amid whose icy boulders Little People are prevalent , perhaps because of the island 's confines . The relationship between them and King Islanders is symbiotic . Familiarity but not fondness . For Little People , Eskimo children make good table ; in turn , fear of Little People makes good tales  --  and helps keep kids in line . <p> " You ca n't have my child ! " Gwen blurted . <p> " Who would want it at this stage , " he knelt and prodded her belly with a finger , " except an abortionist ? " <p> She ceased struggling , knowing it was useless . Sensing the strength of his thin fingers , the power in those sightless sockets , she retreated into herself . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Seward Mountains rising in the distance like points of a crown , the essence of the land flowed as if a whirlpool were swallowing all . Separated from time as if at the bottom of the sea that is the universe , she experienced a clarity of vision and purpose  --  a calm that seemed set as though in balance against the nervous fever that seized her whenever she drank or discovered a pocket of ore . Something ancestral ; for at the bottom of that pooling sea was a voice she could hear but not understand , deeper and more distant than the looning sound that hovered above her now . That deeper voice , she sensed , came from King Island , with its grating and moaning of pressure ridges and the cries of auk and murre and cormorant , a place where no loons lament and the desire for gold exists only in the tales of white men 's greed . <p> " You will work my claim , " the Little Man said , " and I will work my claim , and when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry the placenta to some finer place . " <p> He cackled , and his hands roamed her as if assessing a prize , now unzipping the drysuit , awkward with the ropes , pulling back the rubber and pulling down her thermalwear , exposing her hips . While his fingers explored , she lay looking up from the bottom of her sea , sending her mind past the sun to the stars hidden behind the light . <p> When he moved higher , pulling up the thermalwear , noisily suckling her breasts , she heard King Island call from beyond the sun . She remembered the lore of the Little People . How dangerous they are , how deceptive  --  yet how easy to control if you learn their names . They bury nail parings and feces so humans wo n't find a part of them . Clothes and their own children and their gold and stolen ivory mean nothing to them except as buffers against winter . The only hold a human can get on them is to grasp their truest possession  --  their names , which mirror their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she asked in a voice that seemed not her own , " will you let me go ? " <p> He cackled again . " I 'll see . " <p> He lowered his head once more , and she resolved that she wanted nothing from him except release . Whatever riches he might have cached among these hills could not be worth the risk of her life or that of her child . He appeared to have nothing : more leper than leprechaun . And if he could grant three wishes , as some insisted ? She wanted only escape , safety , an easy delivery come October , a healthy child . <p> One too many wishes anyway , she told herself . <p> His fingers again violated , and she took herself beyond the sun . <p> When reality intruded , it was nearly midnight ; dusk had descended . She was tied to a log as if on a leash , the stuttering no longer from the compressor but from her four-wheeler , sloppily loaded with her supplies , cresting the hill . He rode like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet how , she thought , could he steer without sight ? <p> He could n't . At least not well . He hit the log , toppled across the handlebars and fell groaning onto the sand , where he lay huffing and softly , angrily swearing . When he rose , she was on her feet , dancing like a fighter , ready to kick him . He dodged as she snapped up her leg , hit her in the stomach with his fist . She fell , gasping and nauseous , and wondered if he 'd killed the baby . <p> He lifted her to his shoulder , dumped her across her possessions like a sack of flour , strapped her down with bungee cords and mounted the machine . " I 'll come back for the compressor , " he said , backing away . <p> They jounced along the bank for an hour beneath the moon , took a shortcut , pitching and yawing over niggerheads , and returned to the river , where he dumped her onto a gravel bar below a cascade that cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , he led her by the rope behind the waterfall , into a dripping cave slimed with fungus . She did not resist . She wished she could be free of the drysuit , which chafed her skin despite the thermalwear , but struggled to put the misery from her mind . Did he intend to violate her with more than fingers ? There was an ache and anger in her such as she had never known before . <p> Around her neck he clamped a metal collar welded to a thick chain , padlocked it , and wordlessly retreated into the spray . He was gone for what seemed a day , during which she slept regardless of her discomfort , though physically she was not tired . How many other women had he imprisoned ? she wondered . The chain , linked to a U-bolt on wire around a boulder , appeared ancient . <p> She looked around for bodies or bones , saw none  --  though she could not see past the boxes and assorted trash further back in the cave . <p> " They 'll search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Datsun ... " She was angry with herself for revealing so much . Had her father raised a fool ? <p> " I left it at seventy-mile , " he said . " Ruptured gas tank . Your four-wheeler tracks now say you headed cross-country toward Hot Springs . Machine 's in a gulch . They 'll think you were eaten by a bear , and that someone stole what you left behind . " He shrugged . " It happens . Ca n't trust anyone , what with Outsiders pouring in . " <p> She looked at the blank sockets . <p> " I 'll enjoy delivering the child . " He turned his face toward her chest . " And the child will enjoy suckling . Fatten him up . " <p> She spat . " So you can kill and eat him . " <p> He wiped the spittle from his cheek and , grinning , licked his fingers . " Too many old women among you Eskimos . Too many old-wives ' tales . " <p> " Promise you wo n't hurt the child . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He gave her clothes , helped her undress without touching her , found the vaseline and talcum powder among her things to anneal the chafing , laid down the tent as a tarp , unrolled her mattress and let it blow up , pulled her sleeping bag from its compression sack . He slept in the damp , huddled fetus-like , fists against knees . <p> In the morning she went to work at his command , thinking he might release her if she filled the sample bottles . For a Cingssiik , he knew few technicalities about obtaining gold . Little People were said to be expert . <p> He obviously had selected the site because there was dust sprinkled in the overburden . It made her heart race , but when she trenched the spot and sucked the black sands and gravel up through the sluice , she understood the area 's subtle secret . <p> A stream entered the river just above his site , and in the scallop of a high hill some three miles away , she saw the remains of an old hydraulic mine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the river in reverse deposition . Low-grade ore had been dug out first , followed by intermediate gravels and then tailings from the rich bedrock . <p> The top layer of river overburden contained considerable gold . Below it , there was none . <p> She surfaced laughing at him as he sat on the dredge , feet dangling in the water while he held the chain still linked to her neck and watched the sluice box with an owl 's intensity . <p> When she told him that the site was basically barren , he yanked the chain so hard it nearly ripped off her head . <p> " You lie ! " <p> She choked , treading water . " See ... for yourself ! " <p> He pointed toward the empty sockets . " With these ? Even on land everything 's only shadows ! " <p> Dragging the chain , he pulled her toward the dredge , but she called out that she would try again , and he let loose . Again she dived . <p> For not the first time , the subsurface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resonating through her skull brought tranquillity amid chaos . How childish before , she thought , to have pretended she was shutting out pain whenever she descended . Her parents ' bickering  --  especially when her father had been drinking  --  the whimperish insistence of the boys with their fingers cupped in her hand at the edge of her panties , the homework assignments she had not cared to understand because to her the world was all gold and golden-brown , not the stuff of algebra . <p> How insipid her revulsion toward those petty problems , compared to this ! <p> Grim with determination , she followed a crevice down beneath the overburden , keeping the scooped area small . No sense taxing herself , when she knew she 'd find nothing . <p> Then , in a fissure narrower than the width of her hand , she spied gold more precious than placer . <p> She moved her head , letting the small amount of water she kept in her mask clear the faceplate . Could it be ? Her heart thudded in her ears . <p> After working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the larger sample bottles from her weight belt and laughed inwardly as the gold fluttered to the bottom . She located another piece , with even greater anticipation  --  where there were two , there would be others  --  and wedged the bottle between rocks . A chill seized her . Had he counted her belt 's sample bottles ? Would he know she was literally undermining him ? <p> A slave , she told herself , moving downstream to work new overburden , is never secure . He should remember that as well . <p> She tweezered specks of gold into a new bottle until her fingers cramped and she thought her squint would be permanent . After an hour she barely had a grain of gold , much less a pennyweight . She surfaced . <p> " Nothing ! Just lots of sprinkles . " <p> " The bed 's loaded with ore ! " <p> " See for yourself . " She knew it would set off his harangue , and she reveled in his torment  --  a small victory over her jailer . <p> When he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bellyflopped into the river . <p> He swam otter-like , turning his torso ; dived with arms against his sides . At first she feared he would sense the sample bottle between the rocks , though it was far away , for he saw ... with his fingers . His hands were everywhere : caressing a current , exploring a boulder , showing her specks of gold even she had difficulty discerning . It occurred to her that on the beach he might have been realizing her rather than violating her , checking if she were indeed pregnant . <p> Watching him swim , it also occurred to her that perhaps he was not human but rather descended from a sea mammal ; as according to some people she knew , Eskimos are descended from polar bears  --  the reason for their short legs  --  a belief most other Eskimos found laughable . <p> He stayed submerged four minutes , working the shovel and suction hose , exposing bedrock , awkward with the equipment . By guiding his fingers she showed him that no gold lay beneath the overburden . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was breathing easily , as if there had been no exertion . " Nothing but flour gold , " he said . " You 'll have to amalgam . " <p> " Just find another site . " <p> He shook his head . " Your people file claims with assay offices . Mine file with the gods . This is my claim , as you 're my claim . I 'll remain with what 's been given . " <p> She started to speak , then stuck the regulator in her mouth and dived lest her anger surface as well . She was no one 's treasure . And amalgam ? She would flounder here forever  --  sucking up black sand and using mercury to separate out flakes of gold . How far downriver did his claim descend ? How much overburden must she move ? <p> She sat on the river bottom and watched her bubbles ascend into light . Then she understood . It did not matter how much gold he gathered , only that he cleaned his claim . No cost-efficiency to measure , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the value of gold lay in acquisition , not sale . <p> Should she tell him the sample bottle 's secret ? <p> She swam upward . Would tell him nothing , nothing . But somehow she would learn his name  --  make him her claim  --  and until she could effect an escape , she would siphon off his claim 's real gold . <p> Had she not returned to the Pilgrim to seek the baby 's fortune ? <p> " Okay , " she said , pulling herself onto the compressor platform and drawing up the hose and neck-chain , " you 'll have your wish . We 'll amalgam the shit from the sand . Every speck of it . " <p> He looked skyward , sighed low and deep in his throat . <p> That night , after he camouflaged the compressor , he began to spin tales . She struggled to stay awake lest she offend him and lose what emotional ground she had gained . He told her of finding the gold , of wars with ravens , of songs the tundra 's streams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , " he had to shout to be heard above the cascade , " ah , when I had eyes I saw wonders . Dew on foxglove ... steam from bears ' noses ... sun turning clouds to gold , a treasure no one can steal . " <p> He talked about humans as if they were no longer related to her . The greed of roads and rails , the cry that resounds across the tundra when an alder or caribou falls , how human wishes are not fit for soup-stock . Their dreams brought rainclouds , and in their desire for love a mocking laughter lurked . Humans did not deserve to file a claim , much less work one . <p> " Have you ever touched ... another woman ? " she asked tentatively . <p> With a thumbnail he peeled bark from a willow branch and chewed the pulp  --  apparently his main sustenance . " You are the first . And the last . I will work only one claim . Your coming was not an accident . I prayed to the winds . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " You mean learned my name . " <p> She sensed there was no other way except to reveal her hand . " Yes . " <p> " So you are aware of the legend . Then this I will tell you . I am not Rumplestiltskin ... I know your unipkaaq tales . Though you might call me Rumpled Stillskin . " He laughed sullenly , touched his face . " Rumpled flesh ... but still skin . " <p> He drew the deformed face close to hers . " You need my name , or I will have the child . We both know that . " <p> She saw that within the mouth , hideous and odorous with stinkweed , were tiny filed teeth , pointy as those of pike or piranha . <p> " I 'll grant you three chances to guess my name and seize my soul , " he said . " But if you do guess right , I wo n't confirm it . " <p> His cackle echoed through the cave . <p> " That 's not fair ! " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Fair is the weather . Fair is the wind . " <p> She worked the following days as though in a dream , names running through her like the Pilgrim around her . Three chances , but only body language , or perhaps emotion featured in a face that was not a face , to tell her she had guessed correctly . <p> And then ? she wondered . <p> Her underwater digging and sand uptake grew as feverish as her mind . Her increased production made him treat her more pleasantly . He asked if she were hungry and brought her things , smoked-salmon strips and once a bracelet of woven fireweed , as though her efforts were for his benefit or the desire , like his , to gather the gold . <p> Amid the bundles and boxes in the rear of the cave , she discovered considerable stored mercury , necessary for retorting . That he was well-equipped , despite his raggedy coat and unkempt hair , did not surprise her . What miner or hunter had not had goods vanish from camp ? The skinning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the hats and gloves that sidle away , the fishing rod mysteriously stripped of an eyelet or two . Most are the work of Cingssiik . <p> The days lengthened as the daylight grew , she working ever longer hours . His tale-spinning also became longer , he often repeating the same story , taking up what little time she had for sleep . Irritation replaced avarice . She had half a dozen sample bottles , filled with her special gold , secured on the bottom of the river . <p> By contrast , the gold she brought him was a pittance . Retorting it was painstakingly slow  --  mix in the mercury so it clung to the gold flakes , vaporize it off . He was exultant , she increasingly depressed . Her belly was growing , and none of the names she thought of fit the dwarf . She should be choosing a name for her child , not for a Cingssiik ! Goldman , Goldfob , Goldface , Snowface , Shitface , Snowflake , Goldflake , Goldfinger . <p> " Guess , and I 'll see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Midler , Mesuthalah . It occurred to her that the woman in the Rumplestiltskin tale had not guessed correctly . Someone had overheard the gnome speak it himself , and passed the information along . What victory was there in that ? <p> " Guess , and I 'll see . " <p> " See what ? Whether you will simply kill my baby , or eat it ! " <p> He was seated , fingers steepled , on a stump he had brought into the cave . Leaning close , he whispered , " I never said I would kill the child , " he patted her belly , and she moved back , " and I wo n't kill it . But I will see . I 'll have its eyes . " He touched one of his sockets . " And the placenta to rebuild my flesh , as you humans do with burn victims , and the afterbirth to make me strong again , after the ordeal . " <p> He sat back , clapping childlike , fingers vertical , and watched as the blood drained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So you 'll still have the child ... do n't you see ? " <p> And he laughed . <p> That night , while he lay snoring , she tried to reach something with which to stab him , but the chain prevented it . In her mind 's eye she saw a nine-month hourglass , grains dropping , but rather than rail before the image , she forced herself to be calm and enter the hourglass as though she were at the bottom of a sea . Of sand , this time . And then she knew . <p> She would need sand . And time . <p> " Another golden day for gold , " the Cingssiik said the next morning , lips wrinkled into a smile , face toward the dawn slanting into the cave . He slit a trout 's belly he was about to cook amid grubs and periwinkles . " You will work well today . " <p> She did  --  fearful to arouse his suspicion about her new plan . Acting more haggard than she really was , she waited two days before telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she said , she would be unable to dive . To extract the gold  --  now , quickly  --  they needed greater efficiency . <p> Seeing no disagreement , but rather his tongue touch his lip in anticipation , she suggested they do the retorting with large lots of sand instead of whenever the sluice-box was full . Too much time was lost , she explained , shutting down the compressor , starting up the camp stove , setting up equipment . They should store the sand in the cave , where it would not wash away , until the optimal time for the rest of the process . <p> He agreed , so the next morning she started uphauling sand with reigned urgency . Once , surfacing , she saw him sitting on the floating platform , clapping with delight . Without spilling a grain , he carried buckets-full into the cave and , as instructed , poured them onto her spread-out tent . <p> She prayed a rainstorm would erupt before he declared the sand pile too big and ordered her to start the retorting . Stalling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was almost mesmerized , and invented myriad excuses why the bucket brigade had slowed . <p> One afternoon , as she watched her air ascend into the glow of sun upon the surface , his name came to her . It happened so unexpectedly that her breath caught in her throat ... her subsequent intakes so panic-stricken that for a moment the regulator seemed ineffective . Surface ! she told herself . <p> Only at the last instant did she overcome that instinct  --  then lay back on the overburden , wanting to laugh . <p> She could not have said his name even had she wanted to . <p> When she surfaced , rain spattered the water . Fierce clouds wreathed the sky . As she climbed out , the storm intensified . The Cingssiik was hustling to the cave , buckets in hand , with uncharacteristic disregard for the precious sand . She looked up at the clouds . The rain stung her skin , and she chuckled with irony . For such as he to have a name like that ! <p> Entering the cave , she stripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snow-packs she used for moccasins , and cooked half a dozen tiny ptarmigan eggs he had gathered . She left the camp stove going while she ate . <p> " Might as well start the retorting , " she said . " Storm looks like a long one . Growing darker than Hades out there . " <p> Fool that he was , he happily complied  --  even offered the first bucket . No word of caution , as she had expected , about taking the operation outside . <p> She knew that mixing mercury with sand , then burning away the amalgam after the sand was panned off , would produce mind-distorting , even deadly vapors . It would give her a chance to acquire the key , on a string in his coat , and escape . <p> She hedged her bet . As he leaned forward in anticipation , body language screaming greed , she loaded the retorting vessel to the brim . Heated , it would expand , explode  --  bringing death , the ultimate alchemy . <p> And hedged her bet a second time  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately above it . The vacuum created by the cooling retorting vessel would draw water into the container , where it would turn to steam and explode , had an explosion not already occurred . <p> She sat at the cave 's mouth , the neck chain at its length , panning the next load of sand while the first amalgam heated . The Cingssiik sat with hands hovering above the bulb-shaped retorting vessel , looking for all the world like a man hesitant to touch his pregnant wife 's belly but captivated by the life within . <p> She had expected to feel excited , all-powerful , but as she stared down at the plastic gold pan she was sloshing , she felt her heart slapping the sides . The water blurred , and not all the moisture that touched her cheek was from the waterfall . <p> * * * Wiping her eyes with a napkin , Suzi wets the napkin in a glass and dabs at her mascara , smearing it the more . She smiles weakly . <p> " So she blew him up , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so powerful it cracked the U-ring boulder  --  the stove was on it  --  and knocked Gwen into the river . She was damn lucky . The explosion could have killed her , or she might have drowned . She was so shaken she did n't even go back for the key . Just climbed on the four-wheeler , neck chain and all , and drove away . " <p> I am gripping the table . Consciously I let go , look around as if to assure myself that others are not looking . " The name . What about the name . " <p> During the story , she had eaten a reuben . She lifts the plate , staring at her reflection . " Maybe what came to her at the bottom of that river was only self-delusion , like seeing yourself in a stream and thinking it 's someone worth watching . " She sets down the plate and looks at me . There is a deadness to the eyes , as if nothing exists behind them . " She never could have possessed the Cingssiik 's soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God . " <p> She rises , slack-shouldered , trembling . " I 'm going to the B.O.T. I 'll get drunk , and you can take me home . Do whatever you want to me then , I wo n't mind . " Speaking to the wall , she takes her parka off the peg . " I have my own apartment , away from my parents . My son sleeps in the living room , he wo n't bother us . " <p> I take hold of her arm . " What about the gold ? How could any gold be more precious than placer ? That 's just stream-gold , there 's no difference . " <p> From her pocket she takes a coin , puts it in my palm , curls my fingers around it . " That mine she saw on the hill above the Pilgrim ? That was the old Delacroix . There was a gambling house out there during the Rush . Supposedly the owner salted away a fortune , then died working the mine . Greedy , I guess . People accidentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he 'd made . " <p> Like a poker player eyeing cards I peek at the coin , heart pounding . <p> An 1893 twenty-dollar golden eagle . <p> More precious than placer . <p> " That ... Gwen ... , " I say . " She still has the sample bottles ? " <p> Her hand on the door knob , Suzi blinks several times , as if seeing me in new light or perhaps realizing where she is . Her face hardens . " Do n't bother joining me . Now , or ever . You 're just another little man . " <p> She steps into the wind . As she pulls the door shut , she says , " She never went back to the Pilgrim . She 'll never , ever , go back . " <p> It might as well be a wall before me as a door , for I could no more walk through it than through the eye of a needle . I glance at the other diners , who pay me no heed . I sit down . Man without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanity , I had a cavity filled with gold instead of silver . For supreme vanity , like the movie star who converted a Rolls to a yellow taxi , I chose a back tooth , so no one could see . <p> It has begun to ache . <p> I stare into the night , rubbing the coin , a finger on the tooth . <p> What good , coming to Alaska : here not for challenge or country but for a fortune , in teaching , I never found . Gone from a Washington chalet to a shack , with no compensatory rise in intellect or insight . What good to coach kids , when my colleagues later relegated the national trophies to the attic ? Athletic awards , not academic ones , in the trophy case . <p> The heart is not taffy ; and even that stretches just so far . <p> Surely the Eskimos , though so accepting , sometimes so gullible , see through me . As Suzi did , finally . My soul transparent as black ice above a bitter sea . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my hand , and think of those bottles awaiting me beneath the Pilgrim . Who would know , but ... Gwen ? Who , the snowy owl ? <p> I am tired of struggling up snow-slicked hills against Arctic wind , when behind me is that ladder into the Sound , welcome now . I know a thousand names for gold , have seen the thousand shades of white on the winter land . <p> Someone dims the lights . The final diners rise , move past my table as if by a boulder in a stream . <p> Night curls around Freddie 's like a hand behind a candle flame at bedtime . <p> My filling aches. 2 <p>  --  This is the only story , that seemed relatively complete among several dozen partials in the PowerBook George 's former wife , Mary , sent me . He and I had collaborated on fiction projects for over twelve years . Knowing George 's distaste for diluting local color , I did not add context clues for such terms as Outsiders  --  those of us in the contiguous U.S.  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on March 11th . His body , bloated almost beyond recognition , was recovered from Norton Sound four weeks later ; ironically , the day after Easter . The body had been in the water about ten days . His whereabouts during the interim remain a mystery , as is the question of whether he purposely jumped into the sea or fell through the ice . The funeral was closed-casket . The coroner told me that wave action had rendered the face featureless . The eyes were gone , apparently to gulls ; identity was established by clothing and dental records . The body was denuded of valuables , including the gold tooth Authors ' note : We hope you forgive our little subterfuge .
