FOR MORE THAN A YEAR HE had been a writhing body twisting on the ground under kicks and nightstick blows in what may be the most endlessly replayed videotape ever made . Then on Friday afternoon TV finally gave Rodney King a face and a voice  --  a hesitant , almost sobbing voice that yet was more eloquent than any other that spoke during the terrible week . " Stop making it horrible , " King pleaded with the rioters who had been doing just that in Los Angeles  --  and to a lesser extent in San Francisco , Atlanta , Seattle , Pittsburgh and other cities . He sounded almost dazed by the violence that followed a jury 's acquittal of the cops who had beaten him : the killing , burning and looting , he muttered , were " just not right . . . just not right . " As to black-white relations : " Can we all get along ? " <P> Would that the nation 's leaders , of both races , could find such plain but heartfelt words . Then perhaps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burn themselves out  --  whenever that is  --  could cover healing . Which would make it very unlike the totally deceptive quiet that preceded the King verdict . <P> It had not exactly been unknown that race relations were worsening ; a hundred voices had said so . But not until last week did many whites and blacks realize how deep an abyss had been opening at their feet . And last week 's violence is all too likely to make the gulf still wider and deeper . For blacks the acquittal , and for whites the aftermath , tended to confirm each race 's worst fears and suspicions about the other . <P> Blacks have far more than police brutality to worry about : high unemployment , widespread poverty , poor schools , drug peddlers and criminals who prey on their neighborhoods . But it is no accident that nearly all the great ghetto riots since the 1960s have been triggered by some incident involving arrested blacks and white cops . To an extent that whites can barely even imagine  --  because it so rarely happens to them  --  police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their bodies and lives . <P> Indeed , few things more vividly illustrate the extent to which whites and blacks live in different worlds than their reactions to police brutality . A white who was sickened by the tape of King 's beating would probably have said to himself something like , Look what they 're doing to that poor guy . A black would be almost sure to say , My God , that could be me . And nothing makes blacks feel more helpless than the thought that they can not do anything about it . However innocent a black may be , and however outrageously he or she may be treated , the criminal-justice system simply will not convict policemen of using excessive force .
