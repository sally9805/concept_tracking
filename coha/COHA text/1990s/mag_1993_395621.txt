When I was a child , I would cry and have nightmares when the moon was full . I 'd pull down the shades , jump into bed and hide under the covers . Bad things seemed to happen during a full-moon period . My favorite cat , Dusty , was hit by a car and killed on a full-moon night . Then the only serious argument I can recall my grandparents having happened when the moon was full . We were awakened by my grandmother 's cries and raced down the stairs to see what was wrong . And there they were , standing by the big bay window , the light from that big yellow moon streaming in , my grandmother 's anguished and tearful pleas scaring us little ones to death . If you 're like me and the full moon seems to send you through changes , brace yourself for a double dose of mood swings and surges of emotion this month . Full moons are mostly monthly phenomena . But this August the nighttime skies will be set aglow by two of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a so-called blue moon , on August 31 . It 's a rare event that takes place roughly once every two and a half years , or as folks used to say , " once in a blue moon . " All this makes this month an ideal time to explore the myths , beliefs and allegations of madness associated with the original Goddess of the Night . The lunar effect on planetary tides is undisputed . The moon 's powerful gravitational pull " womanhandles " the oceans , creating two high and two low tides daily . All sorts of sea creatures mate when the moon is new or full , and many humans report an urge to merge . Hospital workers swear obstetric wards are busier on a full-moon night , a result , some say , of the lunar tug on the womb 's fluid . Western science insists these " biological tides " are all in our head . But individual scientists disagree . Robert A.

" THE GREAT MOTHER Before she was upstaged by the sun-ruled , male-dominated religions that bogarted and bluffed their way to power around 1500 B. C. , the moon was worshipped in the Goddess cults that flourished on every continent . " The Great Mother was a complex deity ... and she could appear in any form , " writes Geraldine Thorsten in God Herself : The Feminine Roots of Astrology . " But we cherished her most as the moon . " She was Isis to the Egyptians , Diana to the Greeks and Candi to the Hindus . Even in Christianity , Mary , the revered virgin mother of Christ , has been called the Spiritual Moon . In many parts of Europe , religious art depicts her as a Black Madonna with a full moon beaming brightly behind her . Historians believe the moon was our original concept of God . In some societies , moon-shaped amulets were worn , like crosses , by keepers of the faith . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adorned with a sacred moon badge consisting of a single white shell and two black beads . In ancient Greece , meanwhile , the Minoan moon goddesses sported a necklace of 12 lunar disks . As she saunters around the earth , the moon reflects sunlight in varying degrees . Her 29-and-a-half-day cycle begins in virtual darkness in the new-moon phase and proceeds as she is transformed into a delicate crescent , a half-disk , an almost full oval and a complete disk , and then reverses through a similar set of shapes back to near invisibility . She 's always on time , which makes her a natural timekeeper and the mistress over all measurement . Just about every ancient civilization kept a lunar calendar . Today our Gregorian calendar is dominated by the sun . Yet Easter , Christianity 's most sacred holiday , is always the first Sunday after the full moon following the vernal equinox , the first day of spring . THE MOON AND MENSTRUATION It did n't take our ancestors long to figure out that the moon 's cycle neatly corresponds to the average female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Latin mensis , meaning month or moon . The Mandingo , the Susus and the Congo tribes of Africa and many Native American tribes simply call a woman 's period " the moon . " History is rich in lore connecting our nearest heavenly neighbor with fertility , nurturing and all things maternal and domestic . The stork story is believed to have originated with the people of Niger in West Africa who believed babies are delivered by the Moon Bird and dispatched to earth by the Great Mother , watching from her lunar roost . In ancient Zimbabwe , where a king was sacrificed for his people every year , his betrothal and lovemaking were planned according to lunar phases so that he might get the most mileage out of both . Even today , pregnant southern African-American women share at least one tradition with pregnant women in southern Italy : Both wear moon-shaped charms for protection and to ease the pain of childbirth . For astrologists , the moon rules our feminine side : feelings , attitudes , memory , tradition and women  --  particularly mothers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so below " and assign dominion over various parts of the body to the planets . The moon governs the stomach , bodily fluids , breasts , ovaries and all reproductive organs . It also rules Cancer , the fourth sign in the zodiac  --  the astrological homebody and caretaker . But even if you are n't a " moon child " ( Cancer ) , your moon sign  --  the moon 's position in the heavens at the time of your birth  --  is as significant as your sun sign , giving clues to your innermost needs and desires . Astrologists are n't the only ones looking to the moon for guidance . Even down-to-earth farmers are notorious stargazers and moongazers , waiting for " that time of the month " when the earth is most receptive to seed . The Old Farmer 's Almanac continues to advise : " Plant flowers and vegetables which bear crops above the ground during the light of the moon , that is between the day the moon is new and the day it is full . " LUNAR LUNACY How could such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some cultural historians suspect it has to do with the overthrow of the matriarchy . Those ancient goddess-worshipping cultures knew that the menstrual period is a woman 's most powerful time . " Women would retire to the ancient menstrual huts to commune with the inner beings , " Demetra George writes in Mysteries of the Dark Moon . With the rise of the male-god cultures , men feared the great psychic power of menstruating women . Over time , such women became taboo and were considered impure . This tradition survives today in many cultures , where menstruating women are barred from religious ceremonies and even domestic chores such as cooking . Feminine energy came to be seen as some sort of hysteria . The word lunatic , in fact , comes from the Latin word lunaticus , meaning moonstruck . To this day , scientists furiously debate theories attributing the full-moon period  --  beginning two days before and ending two days after the full moon  --  to a rise in suicides , crime , murder , arson , earthquakes and other loony behavior . I , for one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ societies knew you could n't keep a good woman down , especially when she was having her period . Ceremonial moon rituals were practiced by the Central African Pygmies , Egyptians and many Native Americans . Many twentieth-century women  --  and men  --  are seeking ways once again to celebrate that female force . At the First Woman 's Church in Los Angeles , every service includes lighting candles to the four phases of womanhood , which correspond with the four major phases of the moon . Church pastor Reverend Crystal Bujol explains that the ritual was created because " we had some less than-wholesome attitudes about womanhood ... When we look in the mirror , we must know we are a holy , powerful deity . " The world over , spiritual groups hold full-moon meditations . Many of us consider the upcoming blue moon to be as celestially significant as the equinoxes . Explains Carlos Hudgins , a Baltimore-based medical astrologist , " There are times of the year when there is more God energy in the air , and the blue moon is one of those times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : * ORGANIZE A FULL-MOON MEDITATION . I 've been a facilitator of meditation groups since the early seventies . One group , dedicated to the healing of others , meets each full moon to pray , sing , share food and enjoy one another 's company . We relax our breathing and our bodies by singing soothing songs like " Kum Ba Ya , " the Nigerian healing song or the old gospel song . " This Little Light of Mine . " We speak the name of persons in need . * DEVELOP YOUR OWN FULL-MOON RITUALS . Indulge in something positive . Prayer , a soothing bath , creative daydreaming and lovemaking are enhanced on a full-moon night . Astrologist Donna Cunningham urges women  --  and men  --  to consciously tune in to the feminine , or the " moon within . " * EXPLORE THE RICH TREASURY OF MOON FACTS , FANTASY , LEGEND AND LORE .
