Astronomers are used to finding all kinds of wild things in outer space  --  black holes , colliding galaxies , stars spinning hundreds of times a second , even a 21-piece comet now on its way to smashing into Jupiter . Still , the giant glowing hoops that showed up in a Hubble Space Telescope picture released last week prompted veteran sky watchers to chatter like awestruck kids . " It 's bizarre , " said Christopher Burrows of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore , Maryland . " It 's the neatest thing I 've ever seen . " <P> It 's also among the most puzzling . Two huge hoops  --  each a few light-years in diameter  --  and a brighter , smaller ring are surrounding the site of a supernova , an exploding star whose violent death was recorded by astronomers in 1987 . For millenniums before the blast , Burrows and his colleagues believe , the terminally ill star had been gushing out great volumes of gas , which formed an hourglass-shape " bubble . " ( The bubble would ordinarily have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially thick and slow-moving and thus stayed relatively close to the supernova . ) Then , when the star blew up , the flash of light made the gas glow . Most of the bubble is shining too faintly to be seen at all , but the small central ring is made of dense gas that is unusually bright . <P> Burrows is less confident about his explanation for the fainter , outer hoops : right next to the shining supernova is a very faint object that may be a tightly compacted neutron star , the remains of an earlier supernova explosion . If so , it could , like other neutron stars , be spewing out twin beams of fast-moving particles . The particles , slamming into the hourglass- shape gas cloud , could have created rings that glowed more brightly after the more recent supernova went off . <P> Other astronomers are n't entirely convinced by this hypothesis , and Burrows admits that he 's " going to have to keep watching it for a while to figure out what is really going on . " Whether he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide important clues about how stars die . One thing for sure : these stellar performers can go out with bangs that leave brilliant and lasting marks on the cosmos .
