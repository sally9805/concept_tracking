Spring in the southern Cascades overtakes winter in a rush of small sounds : thermal breezes swirling in the evergreens , birds singing a new tune , snowmelt trickling toward swelling ; streams and bigger rivers , restoring life to the valleys of central Oregon . Warm , rejuvenating , feel-good sounds . I was hearing none of it . Consumed in the hard labor of cross-country ski racing , I doubt I 'd have heard a train wreck out there at the base of Mt . Bachelor one sunny morning last May . All natural sounds had folded into the mechanical grinding of my own self-inflicted urgings . Finish  --  with each pole plant , the same one-word exhortation brought me a stride closer to the end of the line . I had joined three teammates of local origin to take on the six-stage Pole-Pedal-Paddle race from Mt . Bachelor to Bend : a downhill sprint , a five-mile cross-country ski , a 22-mile bike , a five-mile run , a 1.5-mile kayak , and a 500-yard final sprint . I was on board for two stages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and the cross-country leg , which I was hoping only to survive . Fortunately , all we as a team had agreed to care about was finishing . We were in it to share in the experience , as transcendental Californians used to say . We were there to share in what struck me as a rousing send-up of Bend-area soul , a robust , outdoor-oriented consciousness . With roughly 2,600 entrants  --  individual racers and teams like ours , competing in different age and sex divisions  --  the Pole-Pedal-Paddle was n't so much a competition as it was a festival in celebration of heavy breathing . And there happens to be a lot of that going around Bend these days . Bend is one of those fast-evolving pocket-sized Western cities in an invigoratingly scenic environment , heavily populated by thirty- to forty-something , fitness-conscious emigres from metropolis . If you want an escape hatch from big-city constriction and couch-potato indolence , drop in on Bend sometime . " Living here means never having to say " I 'm bored " is the way brochures describe it . The Pole-Pedal-Paddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my Pole-Pedal-Paddle teammates , put it in somewhat simpler terms . " We like our toys , " he said of his fellow Benders . They sure do . In Bend , it would seem , full citizenship can not truly be claimed until you have demonstrated competence in more than one sport . Skiing , cycling , kayaking , running , tennis , golf , rock climbing , hiking , in-line skating , fishing  --  the whole recreational shooting match . You can do any or all of it in and around Bend . A true totem of elevated social rank is a roof rack equipped for multisport toy-toting . Benders have a propensity to turn themselves into what Andy called fun hogs : " We just like to fill our days with fun . " That 's where Mt . Bachelor fits into Bend 's boredom-free picture , because no dedicated , four-season fun hog would ever settle far from a ski area . Twenty-two miles to the west of Bend , Mt . Bachelor rises to its 9,065-foot summit as a symmetrical , volcanic cone reaching from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a ski resort in the latter-day sense of the word , which is to say , it is not a " destination " resort . A couple of base lodges , a big , midmountain restaurant , a bunch of lifts , a bunch of trails : That 's the sum of it  --  no condos or restaurants or nightclubs or swishy boutiques within 15 miles of the mountain . Sitting in the heart of a big chunk of protected forest land , Mt . Bachelor remains , by federal edict , delightfully clutter-free . It is , in short , a ski area , not a resort . The fun-hogging at Mt . Bachelor is enabled by an abundant snowfall , and I can only imagine the psychedelic mystery tour it must be to ski through the opalescent curtain of a midwinter storm smothering open slopes . Having spent two spring visits under nothing but blue skies , I can only imagine such storminess and am glad for that . In May , all a fun hog should want in skiing is to kick back in the warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and blow the worries of winter away . The persistence of snow into early summer has made Mt . Bachelor a late-season port of call for racers in training . On almost any morning from mid April on , serious training is usually in progress . When I arrived , the women of the U.S. national downhill team  --  Picabo , Hilary , Megan , and all the others  --  were hard at work . I felt for them . Skiing at Mt . Bachelor , it seemed to me , should n't be so serious , although it might end up being race-training fast . With 3,100 vertical feet , 360-degree skiing from the summit , and all that snow , Mt . Bachelor calls out to anyone with a passion for speed and a good wax job . Wide-open , not threateningly steep , virtually mogul-free , Bachelor lets you really rip , riding a long , fast edge . Your goggles whistle , and suddenly large chunks of vertical footage have flown by unaccounted for . When you ski Mt . Bachelor as much as a guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andy was our man for the downhill race , the first leg of the Pole-Pedal-Paddle . An all-stops-out Chinese downhill , the objective is to get ahead of the pack quickly and stay there . So would n't you know it  --  Andy , aspiring to be the speediest fun hog in all of Bend , arrived first ( among skiers in our division ) in the exchange zone , where I waited to start the cross-country leg . A lead An exhilarating , flickering contemplation of possible victory . Where the mountains meet the forests and the forests meet the high desert and the desert meets the sky , that 's where Bend is . People have come to Bend and keep coming because they see in it all you 'd ever want in the world , geographically , climatically , recreationally , and metaphysically . They have come in numbers to make the population figures on the city-limits signs obsolete the moment they 're posted : The latest head count : 37,650 and rising . Fast . Many who have moved to Bend have brought with them ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have been waylaid in a previous life or place of residence . New-age retro , that 's what I 'd call it  --  a ' ' 50s innocence reinvented , ' ' 90s-style . A do-the-right-thing spirit prevails : The police ride citizen-friendly bicycles , motorists do n't honk their horns , family bonding ranks high ( there is , for example , a lovingly enacted kid 's Pole-Pedal-Paddle ) , and as one Bender said to me , " We 're really into recycling . " You bet they are . There is an Our Town orderliness to the heart of the city  --  two-story storefront buildings , well-pointed bricks and clean sidewalks , a bank at the corner . Cafes and restaurants serve the beverages of ' ' 90s social correctness  --  cappuccino , latte , microbrewed beers . Live right , play hard , and never have to say you 're bored  --  that 's Bend for you . Ironically , this ' has left some Benders I encountered a bit edgy . They worry that visitors might misjudge them , take them to be no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the deeper issues of humanity . A cross-country skier I spoke with while preparing for the Pole-Pedal-Paddle took a perverse satisfaction in assuring me that Bend has its troubles , all right . He enumerated : Out-of-control urban sprawl within the purlieu of Our Town . The Earth-defiling presence of WalMart and McDonald 's , and incessant , dusty road construction . A sizable chunk of the population nowhere near being aerobically fine-tuned . More disturbingly , a sizable chunk of the population struggling to stay economically above water . Environmental blight brought on by Bend 's way-fast growth . Bend reality is not 24 hours a day of hogging fun . I 'm sure that 's true . Even so , if you were to read Bend 's vital signs , its deep throbbing pulse would be indicated by its zeal for the outdoors and recreation . I 'd say this because of the rush-hour crowd that fills the Athletic Club of Bend . I 'd say this because of the number of committed cyclists and runners I met and the number of local skiers who even in May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd say it because I have now seen how the Pole-Pedal-Paddle can consume so completely the passions of the community , as a rallying nexus for competitors , support crews , and volunteers . It is the civic vent of the year in Bend . The Pole-Pedal-Paddle is to Bend what the Macy 's Thanksgiving Day parade is to New York , what Mardi Gras is to New Orleans . It is , however , different in at least one regard : I will never be able to say that I was a member of a winning team in New York or in New Orleans . And I can say that about the Pole-Pedal-Paddle in Bend . So successfully did we share the experience  --  Jim , Andy , Mark , and I  --  that we won our division . Totally smoked the 30-some other teams , despite my sense dulling trauma on cross-country skis and despite the fact that Andy never got to share in the experience of standing atop the podium . Poor , high-speed Andy . The fastest fun hog in all of Bend had landed himself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clear day , you are treated to the illusion of seeing forever , staring out into the great , open spaces of central Oregon . To the immediate north is Broken Top , the craggy remnant of a volcano that blew its stack ferociously in some ancient time . Beyond are the lakes and forests and lava flows and natural magic that have made so many choose Bend and its environs as their promised land . When standing on the summit , it is also clear that Mt . Bachelor , for all of its apparent symmetry from afar , is in fact a mountain with the molten peculiarities of a mass of burned candle wax . Prominent among these peculiarities are a set of fingerlike projections , just off the summit , known as the Pinnacles , separated by short chutes that are probably Mt . Bachelor 's steepest skiing . I was not eager to ski through the Pinnacles as I stood at the summit one morning ; I 'd find better skiing , I was sure , by traversing farther along the summit ridge to a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in exposure . Because of a subtle turn to the southeast , the snow would surely be much softer than in the shaded midst of the Pinnacles . When you can ski any side of a mountain as you can at Mt . Bachelor , assessing the quality of the snow surface and the effects of sun and wind is of the essence . Yet the skiing is not all like that , not all about judging exposures and choosing lines . Lower down on the mountain , below the tree line , are the groomed trails where the speedballing fun hogs get their kicks . A typical page from their daily program might read like this : Ski four or five runs on the lower mountain , using the Pine Marten Express that rises more than 1,300 vertical feet from the West Village base lodge . When that snow starts getting skied up , head to the Outback on the mountain 's northern flank . Do a half dozen runs there at 1,780 verts a go . Then as the snow starts softening on the upper mountain , head high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each worth 1,725 vertical feet . The vertical footage adds up quickly and early , especially at a ski area that opens its lifts at 7:30 A.M. late in the season , to allow skiers to take advantage of firmer snow in cooler temperatures . By early afternoon in May , the skiing can turn into an exercise in deep-dish slogging . But by then , following the above program , you 've already rung up 25,000 or more vertical feet and are ready for the next activity of the day : golf , mountain biking , cross-country skiing , an Athletic Club workout . I tried them all , adhering to the unspoken canon of your average Bend aerobophile : Do not rest for the day until you have engaged in at least two forms of athletic behavior . That canon , of course , comes to its head in the Pole-Pedal-Paddle . One guy passed me out there in the shadowy forest . I assumed others would come flying by , but not so  --  my mental mechanics apparently had an effect . I passed the three-mile mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last , steep climb to finish in a respectable 23 minutes or so . I sent Jim , our designated cyclist , on his way , and he reported later that for a while he was doing better than 50 miles an hour , rocketing downhill toward Bend . Mark then ran the five miles in something like 25 minutes . The team was on a major roll . In the meantime , Andy and I had to get from the mountain to Bend . We each had a second leg to run  --  Andy was our designated kayaker , and I had to sprint to the finish . I offered Andy a ride , but he insisted on driving himself , a regrettable decision . He 'd make it to the kayak start zone . Not to worry . The party was cranking at Drake Park in downtown Bend by the time I arrived . A band was playing and beer was flowing . Families were stretched out on the deep , green grass , under the summer-hot sun . I stood in the final exchange zone , trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming up the Deschutes River . Then suddenly Jim was in my face , climbing dripping wet from a kayak and exhorting me to bust butt to the finish . Which I did . Our time was 10 minutes better than the second-place team : Victory came with a pile of winners ' booty  --  a free raft trip on a nearby river , a closet 's worth of athletic footwear , other fun stuff . Mark , Jim , and I reveled in our surprising success , but Andy ... where was the fella ? The truth made its way to us later in our extended celebration . Seems Andy had been speeding toward Bend , and when the cops pulled him over , there was something about a suspended license and unpaid tickets . Speed , apparently , was more than just a recreational pastime for Bend 's fastest fun hog , who celebrated victory in the local hoosegow . The lesson to be learned was this : Bend is , indeed , imperfect , as my cross-country friend had insisted . No ideal community would ever have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the law . Still , Bend must be more perfect than most places , because people wo n't stop moving there . The seasons merge seamlessly , and there is no such thing as boredom . Above all , I came to Bend and left a winner , and any place where that can happen must surely be charmed . Destination : Bend/Mt .

Bachelor is wide-open , above-tree-line cruising ; the other half is wide-trail skiing through evergreen forests . The ski area offers limited tree skiing  --  through very thick-trunked evergreens  --  mostly on the north side of the mountain . One of Mt . Bachelor 's interesting features is that you can ski in any direction  --  360 degrees  --  from the summit , although as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the northern or eastern sides of the mountain where most of the lifts are located . Prices A full-day adult lift ticket at Mt . Bachelor is $33 ; a junior ticket is $18 . Bachelor also has an electronic ticket-scanning system that allows you to buy a 200-point ticket for $35 or a 400-point ticket for $69 . A ride on any of the main detachable quads costs 20 points . And if you purchase a multiday ticket , you can trade any one day of Alpine skiing at the mountain for a cross-country package that includes trail pass , equipment rental , and instruction clinic . Getting There Bend is 160 miles southeast of Portland , about a three-hour drive via either I-5 south to Route 20 east , or via Route 26 east to Route 97 south . Most major rental-car agencies are represented at or near the Portland airport . From Portland airport . From Portland , United Express and Horizon Air also provide service to the Redmond airport , 16 miles north of Bend . Because of limited public transportation in the Bend area , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a car is recommended for getting around . Lodging The lodging nearest to Mt . Bachelor is the Inn of the Seventh Mountain ( 800-452-6810 ) , a condo resort 15 miles from Mt . Bachelor . A few miles closer to Bend is Mt . Bachelor Village ( 800-452-9846 ) another condo resort , which includes the Athletic Club of Bend on its premises . Within Bend proper , there are numerous inexpensive motels , lodges , and B &Bs;  --  nothing terribly fancy , but nothing too expensive , either . Dining When Benders are looking for their obligatory Mex-food fix , the place they usually go is Mexicali Rose . The Deschutes Brewery and Pub is another local institution  --  the good home-brewed beers are fresh and the food is decent , but what really popularizes the brewery around Bend is that each year it fields one of the strongest , most killer-aerobic Pole-Pedal-Paddle teams in the competition . ( Must be the hops . ) For high-end dining , Le Bistro is the place to go . Inside Tracks * On sunny spring days , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper reaches is to follow the sun as the day progresses . Ski the eastern flanks first because the eastern snow softens first , then continue to work around the mountain toward the west . * The High Desert Museum , a few miles south of Bend , is a real find . Its exhibits on Western history , culture , and natural life are thoughtfully presented . The only problem : Its hours of operation conflict with the skiing day , causing you to make a very difficult decision . If you want to compete in the Pole-Pedal-Paddle , get your registration in before the first of May . The fee for individuals is $32 ; for teams , it 's $22 per team member . For information on entering and on the various divisions of the field , write MBSEF Pole-Pedal-Paddle , P.O. Box 388 , Bend , OR 97709 ; or call 503-382-3282. * If you 're coming to Bend anytime from mid March on , throw your golf clubs in your ski bag ( or your skis in your golf bag ) . There are 22 golf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open by March . * Nightlife is not one of Bend 's strong suits ; pounding down a couple of fresh-brewed Deschutes quaffs and hitting the sack by 10 is the usual extent of it . If you want to stretch the evening much beyond that , the place to hang is Cafe News for a little hip-hop , a little reggae , and a lot of dancing . Mt . Bachelor , Florida-Style Let 's say you were headed for a vacation in Oregon but you wanted the illusion of being in Florida , at one of those self-contained resort communities that seem so ubiquitous in the Sunshine State . Well then , Sunriver is the place for you . Fifteen miles south of Bend and 20 miles southeast of Mt . Bachelor , Sunriver re-creates that Florida-resort-community concept in the heart of the Oregon woods . The focal point of any self-respecting Florida community , of course , is a golf course , and Sunriver matches the blueprint perfectly . But the resort also comes with an outdoorsy Oregon touch : There are gentle biking and hiking trails that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay in Sunriver as opposed to downtown Bend ? Not for dining opportunities ; the dining overall at Sunriver is pretty limited , though the restaurant in the main lodge is excellent . The accommodations are comfortable but no snazzier , than say , lodging at the Inn of the Seventh Mountain or at Mt . Bachelor Village . Where Sunriver rises above the rest is as a retreat , full of peacefulness and a sense of woodsiness . There is a somnolent walking village in the heart of the community with all the necessities  --  e.g. , grocery store and bakery  --  and a few surprises , such as a record store . But as far as commercial enterprises are concerned , that 's the extent of it . This is about as low-key as low-key gets  --  low key , that is , with a golf course right out the back door . <p>
