<p> It was Nickelodeon 's 20th-anniversary party at the Museum of Television and Radio in New York this month , but Herb Scannell , the chief executive of the children 's TV network , promised to be brief . <p> " I 'm a Nick fan , " he told revelers , using his network 's nickname , " but I 'm also a Knicks fan , " meaning he wanted to get home to watch the Knicks-Pacers game . Wrapping up his remarks five minutes later , he thanked Geraldine Laybourne , his celebrated predecessor . As he lauded her " inspiration and vision , " his voice quivered and his eyes filled with tears . <p> It was vintage Scannell : deferential , almost self-effacing ; the quintessential No. 2 guy . <p> Except that he has been No. 1 for three years now , and has built Nickelodeon , a division of Viacom Inc. ' s MTV Networks , into a $1 billion multimedia powerhouse . When he took over from Ms. Laybourne , few thought he would do much more than stay the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network , some of whom now work elsewhere , know better . So do Nickelodeon 's rivals , who had hoped that Mr. Scannell would stumble . <p> Instead , he has taken Nickelodeon into animated feature films , high-volume licensing and merchandising , digital cable channels , an educational television partnership , Web sites and overseas expansion , all the while reaping more than half of all advertising dollars spent on children 's television . <p> In the process , he has nearly doubled Nickelodeon 's revenue and profits . And the doubters have learned an important lesson about Mr. Scannell : Beneath his boyish face and mild-mannered demeanor lurks the same hypercompetitive personality that drives those Knicks and Mets ballplayers he admires so much . <p> When he heard in the summer of 1997 that " Teletubbies , " the quirky British show for toddlers , was coming to the United States , he summoned his executive troops together to plan a counterattack . Never mind that the " Tubbies " were going to be shown on PBS , a noncommercial channel , and that nobody really knew how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find ways to pump up the promotion and marketing of " Blue 's Clues , " Nickelodeon 's year-old computer-amimated educational show . <p> " He told us , ' Regardless of what they do , we have to be as aggressive as we can , ' " Cyma Zarghami , Nickelodeon 's executive vice president and general manager , said . Mr. Scannell even managed to get a balloon of Blue , the show 's star dog , into the Macy 's Thanksgiving Parade in November . <p> " He is extremely competitive , " Sumner M. Redstone , Viacom 's chairman , said . But , he added : " He 's quietly competitive . You do n't have to shout to compete . " <p> On the other hand , if you are too quiet , people may not realize you 're a fighter . That was Mr. Scannell 's problem in 1996 . He had toiled in the shadow of the charismatic Ms. Laybourne , a combination Pied Piper and business shark who in 17 years had made Nickelodeon not only the most popular children 's network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period . <p> Associates remember how Ms. Laybourne sometimes unleashed a temper that matched her passion for her work . By contrast , Mr. Scannell came across as an amiable and thoughtful logistics specialist who rarely even raised his voice . <p> " Without question , my reaction and that of a lot of other industry people was , ' Can he fill her shoes ? ' " Jack Irving , executive vice president and media director for the advertising agency Saatchi &; Saatchi New York , said . " People felt he was a behind-the-scenes kind of guy . People thought he would have a tough time . " <p> So did his superiors . Mr. Scannell 's background was in programming and marketing , and they wondered whether he had the financial expertise or strategic vision to lead Nickelodeon into the 21st century . Tom Freston , president of MTV Networks , actually moved into Ms. Laybourne 's office for six weeks , acting as president and evaluating Mr. Scannell 's every move . <p> One thing he found was that Nickelodeon 's successful " zigzag " strategy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Mr. Scannell 's gut . " When others zig , we zag , " Ms. Zarghami said . <p> For example , Mr. Scannell had the idea of making Saturday night a special night for children 's variety programs , calling it " Snick , " for " Saturday Night Nick . " And , with Saturday morning hours the stronghold of the broadcast networks , he suggested using Sunday mornings to premiere Nickelodeon 's cartoons . " He did n't just step in and inherit something , " Ms. Laybourne pointed out . " He inherited his own hard work . " <p> Mr. Scannell , 42 , said many of his best ideas came to him at home , an apartment in lower Manhattan where he lives with his wife , Sarah , and their 4-year-old daughter , Caroline . <p> And though a company car could be at his disposal , Mr. Scannell takes the subway to work . " Only three stops on the express train , " he explained . <p> One of his first moves as head of Nickelodeon was to challenge the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Time Warner Inc. ' s Warner Brothers . He persuaded his bosses to invest $350 million to build an animation studio in Burbank , Calif. , that now has five series and four feature films in production for Nickelodeon , and some direct-to-video films in development . <p> Indeed , Nickelodeon 's first animated feature film , " The Rugrats Movie "  --  made last fall in partnership with Viacom 's Paramount Pictures and Arlene Klasky and Gabor Csupo , creators of the popular " Rug rats " television show  --  became the first non-Disney animated film to gross more than $100 million . <p> Meanwhile , the licensing and merchandising division of Nickelodeon has mushroomed in the last three years into a $100 million business , largely on the strength of characters from " Rugrats " and " Blue 's Clues . " <p> Mr. Scannell also took advantage of the broadcast networks ' shift toward filling the 8 P.M. time slot with sexy sitcoms and other adult fare . Since 1985 , Nickelodeon from 8 P.M. on had been showing classic sitcoms like " The Brady Bunch " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nick at Nite . " But in October 1996 , Mr. Scannell moved children 's shows into the 8-to-8:30 slot , and in 1998 , he expanded them into the next half-hour . The moves worked : more children watch Nickelodeon between 8 and 9 P.M. than watch any other network , even though the broadcasters reach 99.4 million homes , compared with Nickelodeon 's 75 million . <p> Last year , Mr. Scannell again caught his rivals off guard . They had expected Nickelodeon to announce an educational channel . What they failed to foresee was that he would start it in partnership with the best-known name in educational television , the Children 's Television Workshop , producers of " Sesame Street " and other highly praised public television shows . The result was a commercial-free educational channel called Noggin , which began in February . " I felt putting us together was like one plus one equals three , " Mr. Scannell said . " It would be building a new model that has its own strength , rather than have two independent guns going at each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of money . " <p> Noggin has already become one of the channels most sought after by cable operators . So has Nickelodeon GAS ( short for Games and Sports ) , another spinoff . <p> Through all his maneuverings , Mr. Scannell has taken advantage of an almost total recall of television history that gives him a gut instinct on how audiences will react to new shows . He even uses TV lore to describe his parents . His father was a social worker in Harlem and later in Suffolk County , where he and his three older siblings grew up , and his mother was a Puerto Rico-born caseworker for Catholic Charities . " My mother and father were like Ricky and Lucy , only in reverse , " he said , referring to Lucille Ball and her Cuban husband , Ricky Ricardo , on " I Love Lucy . " <p> When Mr. Scannell got the chief executive 's job , according to Jeffrey D. Dunn , Nickelodeon 's chief operating officer , he gave himself a crash course in his weakest area , finances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads to set higher goals . " This is where the competitive streak served him well , " Mr. Dunn said . " For Herb , it was n't just , ' How does this work ? ' but ' How are we going to win , how are we going to make take it to the next level ? ' It was empowering . " <p> Not everyone thought so , though . Since he took over , eight high-level executives have left , including the heads of marketing , licensing and the movie division , as well as Rich Cronin , who had been running the spinoff channel TV Land and left to head the Fox Family Channel . <p> One former executive , who insisted on anonymity , said Mr. Scannell had set unrealistically steep financial goals for some departments , trying to goad certain managers to become more competitive . This person said that if the network 's advertising executive had not locked up advertisers to two- and three-year deals in 1997 , the network might have seen a drop in ad revenue this year as its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most advertising agencies , attributes that loss of market share to increased competition from the Cartoon Network and , to a lesser extent , the Disney Channel and the Fox Family Channel . <p> Another executive , still on board but also speaking on the condition of anonymity , said some longtime department heads simply did not respond well to the higher challenges Mr. Scannell had set for them . <p> " He made people deliver , " Ms. Zarghami , the network 's general manager , said . " The ones who were delivering were the ones who stayed . " <p> Mr. Scannell still has his critics within management ranks , though they understandably decline to speak for attribution . Some say that compared with Ms. Laybourne he is a micromanager , while others grouse that his drive to increase sales is putting at risk Ms. Laybourne 's mantra , " Kids first . " <p> For example , the week before the " Rugrats " movie was released last November , Nickelodeon removed the show from its 7:30 P.M. time slot , and ran a promotional spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'll be back at their normal time next Monday . " <p> Some parents complained that their children had been disappointed not to see the show . Other resented the gimmick , which , naturally , led many children to ask " What 's Hollywood ? " and then , " Can I go see the movie ? " But the move did help sell tickets , bolstering Nickelodeon 's bottom line . <p> Viacom does not report Nickelodeon 's results separately . But cable analysts at Paul Kagan Associates , a media consulting firm , project revenue of $865 million at Nickelodeon 's domestic network this year , up from $570 million in 1996 , and $431 million in cash flow , a measure of profit , compared with $291 million three years ago . <p> When ancillary businesses and Nickelodeon 's international earnings are added ( it has channels in Latin America , Britain , parts of Europe , Australia , Japan , Indonesia and South Africa ) , the division is expected to earn about $500 million on revenue of nearly $1 billion . <p> Fred Moran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Nickelodeon was " probably the fastest-growing established , nonstart-up , media-related entity . " <p> " Wall Street 's focus with Viacom has been on whether Blockbuster would turn around , or on the performance of the studio , driven by ' Titanic ' and other successful movies , " Mr. Moran added . " But the quiet , always predictable leading performer among Viacom 's assets is without question Nickelodeon .
