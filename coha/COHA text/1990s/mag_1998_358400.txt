My personal opinion is that the photos do cross the line . But do you want my opinion or the store 's ? " asks the clerk who picked up the phone at an independent Manhattan bookstore specializing in art and photo books . She is responding to my queries about David Hamilton , the photographer whose recent collection of images of nude young girls , The Age of Innocence , prompted an Alabama grand jury to indict Barnes &; Noble on charges of selling child pornography . This action came in response to protests by Christian activists , fanned nationwide by the likes of Randall Terry , the antiabortion activist and conservative talk-show host . It wo n't surprise you to learn that the opinion of Barnes &; Noble , the largest U.S. bookstore chain , is that the photographs do n't cross the line and that booksellers must stand up for the public 's First Amendment right to buy high-gloss photos of naked teenagers . In a recent editorial , the New York Times agreed . And no doubt it is civil libertarians who , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snapping up The Age of Innocence at $45 a pop and causing it to be virtually sold out in New York City , as I discovered after calling a dozen stores . It is doing well elsewhere too : the British book 's American distributor says it is out of stock and has been sent back for a new printing . The public , then , has voted . But me , I 'm with the independent bookstore clerk and , just this once , Randall Terry . <P> Me , a liberal member of the media elite who does n't have a problem with genuine obscenity when it involves adults . But here I am advocating censorship , I suppose  --  or let 's say voluntary censorship on the part of bookstores  --  if you take my opinion of Hamilton 's work to its logical conclusion . The Age of Innocence is really something , though : page after page of pubescent girls in poses reminiscent of those in a Playboy layout circa 1975 . The camera 's gaze is solemn , the lens gauzy , the light that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers are coyly sucked , panties pulled at , genitalia caught artfully winking out of bathing suits . In order to remind us that this is art and not , say , a file on the hard drive of some about-to-be-arrested principal , the photos are captioned with musings on adolescent sexuality from literary folk like Spenser ( " Her nipples like young blossomed jessamine " ) , Dryden ( " Young am I and yet unskilled " ) and , most appallingly , Anne Frank ( " Am I only 14 ? Am I really still a silly little schoolgirl ? " ) . One photo of a pert but defiant-looking young thing is labeled with an uncredited " Ne touchez pas . " Another reads , " Not unless  --  or until  --  I say so ! " Could you possibly not be wincing ? I found myself both amused and repelled by The Age of Innocence  --  it 's as campy as it is creepy . But that 's no defense . <P> The problem is n't with taking nude photos of minors per se , nor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mann and Jock Sturges are two photographers whose unobjectionable work plies the same waters with , respectively , provocative and banal results ( New York Times critic described the typical subject of one of Sturges ' photos as " just a J. Crew model with no clothes to sell " ) . Their work , however , has also been the subject of recent protests , and one of Sturges ' books , Radiant Identities , is cited in the Alabama indictment .
