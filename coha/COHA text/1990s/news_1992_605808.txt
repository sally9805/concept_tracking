<p> Czechoslovakia 's " Sale of the Century " was looking more and more like the bust of the year , despite months of government advertising . <p> Urged to spend $ 35 for shares in the country 's wheezing state-run industries , most citizens chose to save their money . By the new year , the government had failed to unload millions of share-voucher booklets it hoped would spur the most radical economic privatization program in Eastern Europe . <p> Then came Viktor Kozeny , a glad-handing , 28-year-old Czech with an economics degree from Harvard , class of ' 89 . Almost overnight , with an investment fund named after his alma mater , he transformed the voucher plan into something like the Oklahoma land rush . <p> Kozeny 's idea was simple , if not entirely novel . In hundreds of television and radio ads , he guaranteed a 10-fold return in a year 's time to those who entrusted management of their vouchers to the Harvard Fund . <p> Owning a piece of $ 9 billion worth of former state assets suddenly seemed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investors , other funds sprang up and followed Kozeny 's lead , promising profits of 10- , 28- , even 100-fold . " Have you been cheated a lot in your life ? " read one fund 's full-page newspaper ad . " That 's why you should n't miss out on this guarantee ! " <p> The number of share-voucher booklets sold jumped to 4 million , then to 7 million . At post offices , where the vouchers are sold , prospective buyers attacked clerks who tried to shut the doors promptly at closing time . Government officials now estimate that as many as 10 million people may buy vouchers by the end of the month  --  more than 60 percent of the population . <p> " Two months ago , people did n't know or care what it meant to be a shareholder , " said Dusan Triska , a senior adviser to the Finance Ministry . " Now all everyone talks about is investment , shares and capital gains . " <p> But the rush to prosperity has also brought Kozeny more than his share of grief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fund , but no charges have been filed ; a government minister attacked Kozeny 's promises as a hoax and an " unacceptable enticement ; " rival funds accused Kozeny and his 22,000 sales agents of operating a doomed pyramid scheme . Kozeny attributed the attacks to envy and fear of the unknown . " We 've done nothing illegal ; all we 've done is be successful , " he said . <p> Nonetheless , Kozeny 's profit claims have raised serious issues in both public and private circles here . Among them is the question of cash . Where , officials demanded , will the Harvard Fund get the $ 14 million it will need if even 10 percent of its investors want to collect their guaranteed $ 350 profit as soon as possible ? <p> Kozeny said he can easily raise the money from company funds and foreign banks . He expects the value of Harvard Fund shares to rise rapidly in the coming year , but even if they do n't , he said , the shares are so undervalued that new investors , including foreign banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loans to pay off shareholders who want out . " It 's like borrowing $ 10,000 against a house worth $ 80,000 , " Kozeny said , adding that he expects most buyers to hang on to their shares as long-term investments . <p> Some Western financial experts say the privatization program faces yet another troublesome question that could hobble Kozeny 's fund and the more than 450 other investment trusts that have sprouted here in recent months : With millions of new shareholders and hundreds of neophyte securities traders , managers and sales promoters going into business , does Czechoslovakia have the legal and practical expertise to regulate the overnight creation of a full-blown stock market ? <p> Many Western analysts are skeptical . One investment specialist described the Czechoslovak program as " former socialist economists trying to start up a functioning securities market in eight months in the virtual absence of any kind of securities law or safeguards . " <p> The consensus of the Western financial community , he said , is , " yes , it 's a lovely idea , but they 're overlooking some major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volumes of securities law to fill your living room , and there 's a reason for that . In the absence of good laws , there can be all sorts of short-term profit taking and stock raiding and genuine damage to good , struggling companies . " <p> " It 's like the genie in the bottle , " Kozeny said cheerfully , as workmen put finishing touches on the marble foyer of his new suite of offices in an outlying district of Prague . " They let the genie out , and now the genie is running around doing all these things they never imagined . " <p> Kozeny 's brainstorm was to give nearly every Czechoslovak citizen a comprehensible stake in one of the most fundamental and complex social transformations underway in post-communist Eastern Europe  --  getting government out of business . <p> In theory , privatization of state-owned industry solves several problems at one stroke . It ends clumsy government control of factories , empowers new teams of independent managers , attracts new capital and frees the state from direct responsibility for unemployment . In practice , privatization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperate need for foreign capital and a populist fear that foreigners will buy up the country at fire-sale prices . <p> East European countries seem to have designed their privatization strategies in direct proportion to public tolerance of foreign ownership . The neatest case was that of the former East Germany ; capitalist West Germany simply swallowed it whole , pumping in hundreds of billions of marks to rebuild industry , cover the costs of resulting mass unemployment and mitigate the effects of social discontent . <p> In Hungary , where public concern over the intrusion of outside capital is slight , the government has encouraged foreign investors to buy entire factories and other enterprises outright . <p> In Poland , where nationalist politicians have fanned ancient fears of foreign domination , the government has tried several approaches  --  everything from traditional stock offerings in a handful of profitable companies to selling off batches of companies in lots . It first debated and rejected mass privatization as too complicated to manage , but on Friday the new center-right government announced it will go ahead with sales of stock in about 200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poland 's 8,500 state-owned industries to the private sector within two years . <p> Czechoslovakia , under the relentless prodding of Finance Minister Vaclav Klaus , has taken the most radical road . More than 2,570 companies  --  roughly 40 percent of the economy  --  are to be privatized by sales of shares throughout society . " What 's going on here is an entirely new distribution of power and wealth ; it 's the greatest ownership transformation in our history , " said Finance Ministry adviser Triska . <p> The Czechoslovak program is intended to guarantee that a maximum number of citizens , even the poorest , have a toehold in the new capitalist system . By distributing up to 80 percent of certain companies to citizen stockholders , mass privatization also is intended to keep important businesses from falling entirely into foreign hands . For the price of a week 's salary  --  about $ 35  --  every citizen is entitled to buy 1,000 vouchers that are to be converted this spring into shares in up to 10 different companies . <p> The idea was that citizens would invest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factory , for example . " Use your common sense , " Klaus advised citizens . " You may know more than all these bankers . " <p> But the promise of guaranteed profits by fund managers like Kozeny , combined with inexperienced financiers , first-time shareholders and a dearth of market regulation , has begun to focus attention as much on capitalism 's risks as its potential payoffs . Because the new stocks are likely to pay few dividends in the forseeable future , " there is a justifiable fear that our investment funds will behave more like speculators than investors , " said Jan Vrba , industry minister of the country 's Czech republic , in a recent speech at Harvard . <p> One senior Czechoslovak economist believes the majority of stockholders will choose to collect their profits as soon as possible , flooding the market with shares and perhaps precipitating a collapse of security prices . As Kozeny suggested , foreign banks and investors may indeed step in to scoop up undervalued assets , said one Western banker , but he added that this might not be politically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts say , the mass privatization program has had a dampening effect on foreign investment here . <p> Officials here also worry that failing swift gratification , the public could grow disillusioned with the whole business of investing . " We are effectively selling shares , however cheaply , in companies that may or may not have any future ; potential buyers have very little information to help them choose , " Vrba told the Harvard audience . " There is a great danger that large groups of new shareholders will end up losing their faith in shareholding completely . " <p> But most Czechoslovaks who have studied the privatization program say there was no choice but to push ahead as fast as possible . " The most extensive privatization was Thatcher 's in Britain in the ' 80s , " after a far less comprehensive socialist experiment , noted journalist and economic analyst Petr Husak . " She privatized 10 percent of British industry in seven years ; Klaus says if we worked at that rate , it would take us 400 years . "
