<p> When Michael Young threw his wife a birthday party at an inn on Cape Cod , he did n't fret about finding time to plan . <p> He called his company 's concierge instead . <p> At Andersen Consulting 's office in Boston , on-site concierge service is only one of the perks . A shoeshine service sets up shop on Fridays . Dry cleaning is dropped off every morning at the front desk . <p> Such exotic workplace conveniences used to be a trademark of the high-tech industry , innovations that drew snickers beyond California or the Pacific Northwest . <p> No longer . Time-saving perks are gaining a foothold in other industries where competition for top hires is increasingly stiff . <p> " No question about it , the market we 're in is very hot . We 're looking for people with the hottest of skills , " says Young , a managing partner with Andersen 's Boston office . " Clients come into this office and say this is a model we need to adopt . " <p> Today you can find tailors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft-drink companies . The trend is being fueled by more time-pressed , two-income families and the tug of war between employers seeking job candidates . <p> The perks represent a major shift for employers , who are expanding their basic menu of benefits to keep workers around . <p> " There 's a whole new mind-set , " says Jane Winter , founder of LesConcierges , which provides services to companies headquartered in the USA . " So many employers are competing in this economy . It 's not just the software programmers who need us anymore . " <p> Some examples of workplace services , including some that are free and some that charge a fee : <p>  --  At MBNA America Bank , based in Wilmington , Del. , the USA 's second-largest credit card company , employees at some locations can pay to have their clothes hemmed by an on-site tailor . There is an espresso bar with Belgian chocolates and French pastries , a barber shop , shoe repair , film processing and free travel service . <p>  --  At AlliedSignal 's corporate campus in Morristown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prescription drug services . Vendors come and sell their wares , such as china , pots and pans , candles and sweaters in the corporate cafeteria . <p> " You can do your Christmas shopping on site , " says Kristin Lemkau , who works at the technology and manufacturing firm . <p>  --  At Barnett Banks , based in Jacksonville , Fla. , employees at some locations pay for car washes or buy items such as potato chips and umbrellas from an on-site convenience store . More than 100 employees send their children to a public grade school located on the campus . ( Story , below . ) <p> The timesavers , known as " convenience benefits , " usually come at market or subsidized prices . Health care services are often covered by insurance plans . <p> Boosting productivity <p> Employers in industries such as banking , insurance and manufacturing say the workplace perks are in their own best interests : Saving workers ' time can also boost productivity . <p> " Most work and family benefits are driven by the idea that it 's not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a workplace expert with Boston College . " It 's also good for the company . " <p> A 1996 study through Compensation &; Benefits Review found most respondents had some sort of work-site convenience . Nearly 30% offered on-site gift stores , for example , and 22% had on-site medical care . <p> The survey showed that respondents from large firms tended to offer more conveniences and give higher ratings to the effect those perks had on productivity . <p> " Employers who offer these benefits also tend to have flexible schedules , " says Marcia Miceli , a visiting scholar at Georgetown University . <p> Sending the wrong message ? <p> Some worry , however , that the extras could be used to sidestep flexible schedules or broader changes . Others say the benefits may send troubling messages by discouraging employees from taking personal time out during the workday . <p> " All these services are an incredibly important phenomenon that recognizes couples and families in the workplace , but there is a line you have to draw in the sand , " says Andrea Gabor , author of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage . " They 're great as long as they do n't impinge on freedom . " <p> Many of the benefits mimic the type of extras typically offered by high-tech firms . <p> At Autodesk , for example , a dry-cleaning service delivers to cubicles and chefs prepare take-home dinners , such as blackened chicken or handmade ravioli . <p> " I get to do my husband 's laundry , too , " says Jennifer Heller Reidy , an employee in marketing at the software maker 's headquarters in San Rafael , Calif . " It all saves you time . " <p> Similar timesaving conveniences are found at PepsiCo 's corporate campus in Purchase , N.Y . <p> Employees can pay to use on-site dry cleaning or a company store . There are nurses on staff and a doctor available part time . The cafeteria prepares chicken or pasta dinners that workers take home . <p> " Anything you can do to make people 's lives a little easier is appreciated , " says PepsiCo 's Dick Detwiler . <p> Benefits are being added as more employers build suburban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is coming from business owners eager to set up shop where customers work . <p> Providing the services <p> Companies are n't the only ones trying to win workers over : Entrepreneurs also are cashing in . <p> Some start-ups will organize cluttered desks or help workers manage hectic schedules . Dentists , psychologists and massage therapists are taking their services on the road . <p> More than 90 employees have been added since 1994 at LesConcierges , a company headquartered in San Francisco , whose errand runners could put Martha Stewart to the test . <p> The concierges have decorated a cubicle with fake palm trees for a party , for example , and hand delivered Dom Perignon to weary employees getting off planes . <p> Companies served by the firm include GTE Government Systems , Lockheed Martin , Silicon Graphics , Sun Microsystems and Microsoft . <p> " The days of having one or two personal assistants who could get you coffee are gone , " says LesConcierges ' Valerie Raszka . " People need help . " <p> The types of benefits offered are limited only by imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breast-feed babies , video-rental services and counselors who help plan birthday parties . <p> " People are time starved , " says Richard Federico at The Segal Co. , a New York-based consulting firm . " A lot of time that people spend away from the office is really on personal chores . " <p> Naps to root canals <p> High-tech firms , however , still remain the place where some of the most exotic conveniences are found . <p> At Neversoft Entertainment , for example , workers nap on company couches and bring dogs to the job . <p> " They want showers , but I can only go so far , " says Joel Jewett , co-owner of the game-making company in Woodland Hills , Calif . <p> At Netscape Communications , a van rolls in twice a week to provide dental services , including root canals . There is also a concierge service through a private firm . <p> " I 've used it for many things , " says Howard Doherty , an employee at the software development firm in Mountain View , Calif . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exterminator , so I called the concierge . " <p> But other industries are pioneering their own unique benefit plans , often tailored to the needs of their workforce . <p> At a frozen foods division of ConAgra in Omaha , an employee whose child is sick does n't need to take the day off . The company will send a trained sitter to the worker 's house and pay 75% of the cost . <p> Dormitory-style housing is being built beside an Arkansas plant , so workers have a place to sleep if they do n't want to commute home . And a traveling dry cleaner rolls in twice a week at the Omaha site , serving employees in the parking lot . <p> " We 're trying to be the employer of choice , " says Joan Lukas at the diversified food company based in Omaha . " It 's just gotten so competitive , but the services are exciting . "
