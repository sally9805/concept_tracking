The doctor is in. it took more than 20 years , but after six successful books and numerous articles by and about him , neurologist Oliver Sacks , 61 , has arrived ( all 210 burly pounds of him ) as the latest two-cultures hero , a man of science as well as a man of letters . W.H. Auden detected the budding synthesis in Sacks ' work in the early 1970s , when he declared Sacks ' book Awakenings a masterpiece of medical literature . Hollywood grasped this high concept two decades later . Awakenings , the movie , starred Robin Williams as the dedicated doctor and Robert DeNiro as a patient temporarily freed from years of catatonia by Sacks ' experimental use of the drug L-dopa . <P> Sacks has since had to cope with the symptoms of contact celebrity . He receives 15,000 letters a year ; invitations and requests arrive daily . An assistant who handles this traffic is currently turning down lecture bookings for the rest of 1995 . A good chunk of Sacks ' time goes to the BBC , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sacksian spin-offs : Harold Pinter 's 1982 play A Kind of Alaska was inspired by Awakenings . Both a Michael Nyman opera and Peter Brook 's The Man Who are theatrical versions of Sacks ' 1985 best seller The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat ; the Brook play opens at the Brooklyn Academy of Music this week . <P> Sacks ' latest book should not be lost in the commotion . An Anthropologist on Mars is still another collection of wide-ranging essays that he calls " neurohistories , " an anecdotal form that combines science , sympathy and old-fashioned storytelling . Where most clinicians study at arm 's length a case of amnesia , say , or autism or agnosia ( inability to recognize a word or a shape ) , the British-born physician tries to see through the eyes of the patient . " The study of disease , " says Sacks , " demands the study of identity , the inner worlds that patients , under the spur of illness , create . " <P> This is a bold statement in an age that seeks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a word that comes easily to many physicians , but Sacks strongly believes that invention is a measure , if not a definition , of health . His own robust literary output flows from different sources . " It 's the mixture of physiology with poetic and often tragic accounts of the subjective aspects of being ill , of neurological syndromes which fascinates the two halves of me , " he says . " I might go to an Ibsen play one night and a physiology meeting the next . " Now those two halves have come together . " It 's the relation between these two centers that is sometimes complementary . " <P> In the most illustrative essay in Anthropologist , Sacks introduces Temple Grandin , who in her childhood was found to have Asperger 's syndrome , a high-function form of autism . Grandin now holds a Ph.D . in animal science and a teaching post at Colorado State University .
