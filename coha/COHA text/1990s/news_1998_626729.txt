<p> Hold a straw up to your eye and look through it . Keep your other eye closed . <p> See that constricted circle of sight ? That 's all John R. London has to work with as he moves gingerly through life . <p> Imagine peering through that pinhole while teaching a computer novice the intricacies of Windows 95 . <p> Or while disassembling a computer and putting it back together from the ground up - totally by touch . <p> London has retinitis pigmentosa , an inherited degenerative disease that gradually eats away peripheral vision and ultimately will rob him of all sight . When you talk to London , all he sees is a small circle containing your lips , on which he focuses intensely . His eyes look like river water , sparkling and deep , reflecting light but nothing else . <p> He also has an inherited hearing loss and must wear two hearing aids . <p> But London is in hot demand in the vocational computer lab at Houston Community College 's Central Campus . The moment he enters the room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start calling . " John ! John ! " they implore . " Come here , John , I need you ! " <p> The self-taught computer whiz is a beloved figure about campus , the one everyone calls when a hard drive crashes . But his life today differs markedly from an earlier time , when he let his disabilities drag him down in a swirling maelstrom of drink and drugs . His computer expertise and a spiritual awakening have led him into a full , rich life . <p> Grinning and upbeat , speaking with a gentle lisp , London describes a life that by all rights could have ended dismally . <p> " Sometimes I think I had to go through hell , just so I can sit here now and help people , " the college computer lab employee said . <p> London , 49 , spent much of his life trying to ignore the fact that there was something wrong with his eyes and ears . The son of Baptist missionaries , London grew up in Chattanooga , Tenn. , and Guatemala . He did poorly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his eye disease slowly manifested itself . ( His paternal grandfather also had it , he said , but back then no one understood the condition . ) London faced regular rejection and ridicule , from his peers as well as his parents , with whom he broke contact long ago . <p> " All my life my mother told me I was clumsy , but I was just blind , " he said . <p> As a young adult , London did his best to pass as a fully sighted person . He got a job as a welder at a plant that made nuclear reactors in Chattanooga , using touch and what sight he had to lay molten lead across a line . He moved to a booming Houston in 1979 and got another welding job . <p> Two years later , he almost mowed down two women crossing the street in front of his car . He was turning right and because of his dwindling peripheral vision , did n't see them . He quit driving and got a job as a hotel maintenance man . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ berated his " clumsy " employee . Still in denial of his growing blindness , London started drowning his rage in drink and " all that other stuff . " <p> He found a job as a shipping and receiving clerk for an employer who finally convinced him to wear hearing aids . A woman he was dating - tired of watching him walk into poles - convinced him to visit the Commission for the Blind for an exam . He relented , and was finally diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa . <p> " The doctor came in and said , ' Son , there 's no hope for you . ' " <p> London was devastated . Suddenly , all his troubles since childhood made sense , but it did n't help . Anger welled up . <p> When he was laid off in 1991 from another job as a hotel housekeeper , London had reached an impasse . That 's it , he thought : He either was going to make a major life change , or give up . He moved away from all his wild friends . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IBM 286 computer , reasoning that if anything spelled the future , it was computers . For seven years , he studied the computer 's every nook and cranny . Not with books or classes , but his own tactile experience and talking to technical support staff on the telephone . A friend , interested in what London was doing , bought six used , broken computers and gave them to him . He fixed every one . <p> During this time , London also experienced a spiritual reawakening and began attending church again . And he finally " accepted " his white cane - a practical as well as symbolic decision . <p> " God was able to work with me once I did that , " he said . " When you work against yourself , when you do n't accept yourself , you ca n't achieve your goals in life . " <p> His goal , he decided , was to tear down stereotypes about the disabled in a world relentlessly focused on the physical . To that end , London decided to run in the 1994 Tenneco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him out training - this man who could barely see - and be stumped . What , they asked , about potholes ? <p> " I told them I do n't think about the potholes ; I think about the finish line . If you think about the holes , you 'll fall in , " said London , now a philosopher . <p> He successfully completed the race and ran two more after that , including the New York Marathon , using his cane and other runners as his guides . <p> And he enrolled at HCC , where he soon met Dr. Martin Houg , lead counselor of the department dealing with services for disabled students . Houg , a longtime marathon runner , recognized London from news coverage during the Tenneco race . After learning of the student 's work with computers , he asked London to fix a broken home computer . He was impressed with the results . <p> When the department needed an assistant for computer teacher Robert Trevino and a technician to handle adaptive equipment - elements added to computers that make them accessible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Yes , I had serious qualms , " Houg said of his recommendation to hire a legally blind person as a computer technician . " But he 's just done a tremendous job . He 's amazing . " <p> London has become a fixture on campus , with his cane and sunglasses ( necessary because of light sensitivity ) . In addition to helping in the computer lab - used by vocational students as well as those with disabilities - he 's a roving computer trouble-shooter , helping out in other departments as needed . His life , he said , is now devoted to the students . <p> He knows where the computer icons are by memory . If he must deal with a new program , he scans the computer screen methodically from edge to edge to memorize it . To teach keyboarding , London blindfolds students so they wo n't have to rely on sight to type . <p> As for when the day comes when that small circle of light goes dark , London shrugs and says he tries not to think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something with my life now . We 're all going to die anyway , so why worry about it ? " <p> London has a small scar across his chin , the vestige of the time he crashed his Firebird into a bridge going 100 mph with no seat belt on . Right before impact , London said , he saw two brilliant , white-robed figures hovering by the bridge . He thinks they were angels , sent there to spare him . People have told him this means his life has some special purpose . <p> Sue Moraska , program manager for HCC 's vocational program , believes it . <p> " He 's had to overcome so much , yet he 's so helpful , so friendly and compassionate , " she said . " He 's like an angel . Like a living angel . "
