AT FIRST YOU MIGHT THINK Gabriella Brown incapable of speech , but as you came to know her better you would understand her reticence to be completely voluntary , a reasonable response to the noise around her . How the world loves to make noise ! Picture corn kernels in a popping machine , and then imagine a small feather in the center , hidden underneath all that buttery jabber  --  that 's Gabriella , the feather in our midst . La bella Gabriella , who can say almost anything that needs to be said with her lovely , capricious green eyes . <p> Born on the first of June , 1917 , she is twenty today . Two happy decades behind her , and she remains as serene as a sun-soaked house cat . The youngest of six children as well as the only daughter , she has always been properly cared for by her parents , treasured by her brothers , and favored by her two great-aunts , who see in her their own lost youth and so have devoted themselves to preserving her . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as adored and adorable as she , it could only have been la prima Gabriella , the girl 's maternal grandmother , a creature as simple as she 'd been beautiful , a nineteenth-century Neapolitan girl apparently confounded by the world to the day of her death . The first Gabriella had been as serene as her namesake , though she manifested her happiness not with silence but with song and from childhood on preferred to sing her part of any conversation : trilled with sloppy vigor as she washed dishes , hummed cheerfully as she hung clothes on the line , and somehow managed to grow both more foolish and more beautiful with every passing year . <p> Had she stayed in Naples , the first Gabriella would have married one of her own kind , a cousin or a neighbor , and lived out her years behind the same shutters of the same ancient stone house on the via Gregorio . But her two older sisters had higher ambitions , and in 1881 they made it to America , where they found jobs as chambermaids in a Manhattan hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New Jersey . After three full years of hard work , they sent for Gabriella , their little jewel , the one whose beauty would purchase decades of happiness for all of them . <p> Young men did n't want intelligence in a wife , the two sisters be , lieved ; young men wanted ample hips and a face carved from Carrara marble . Young men wanted a mate who would never grow old and so would want Gabriella , with her broad , glassy cheeks sloping to a pert chin , thick lips rising to a peak , childish eyes hooded by dark lids , waist-length , woolly black hair . But the girl did n't know what was good for her , and before her sisters could interfere she had married a penniless farmhand from Ohio , nothing to distinguish him from a million other drudges . Simple , beautiful Gabriella , who never attempted to learn English , gave him three children before she died at twenty-four after slipping from the roof of her house , having climbed up to spy on sparrows nesting in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lost his job , and one day just disappeared . <p> Gabriella 's three children would have become wards of the state had it not been for the aunts , who used their life savings to make a down payment on a Marwood house large enough to accommodate their nephews and niece and spent the next fifteen years struggling to make ends meet , a saying of which both aunts grew particularly fond . They did whatever they had to do  --  worked extra hours , took out a second mortgage , pawned jewelry , raised the limit in a game of five card draw  --  in order to make ends meet . This became the defining logic of the household : every effort should result in a sum equal in value to a necessary item , not a penny unaccounted for , not a need ignored . Whatever was earned had to be spent , and loan payments were always made on time , just barely . <p> The thrill of debt was something the aunts came to relish . Conflating opportunity with chance , the two sisters discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night  --  in English  --  about how they would manage on their limited means . So what if they were n't able to retire at age sixty-five and buy a seaside bungalow ? So what if they did n't have a wealthy younger sister to invite them for sumptuous meals on holidays ? Life in these United States was more exciting than they could have imagined , full of breathless financial escapades , pressing debts , and afternoon poker games in the back room of Willie 's Sweet Shop on Market Street . <p> All of which made life for their nephews and niece precarious . The older boy , Tony , who as the firstborn developed early on a confidence the others lacked , came to share his aunts ' love of gambling and by the age of sixteen had hooked up with a small clan that presided over the Belmont racetrack . The younger boy , nicknamed Trip because of his poor coordination , never got used to the many close calls that so pleased his aunts and in contrast to his brother became a pale , bookish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue . He chose , finally , the thankless profession of copy-editing . Day after day , from age twenty-one until his death forty-seven years later , Trip sat in a back office correcting mistakes in medical textbooks . He took his lunch at the Hotel Taft and spent weekends in New Jersey with his sister , Clara , who to her family 's dismay had given up her well-paid job as a secretary in a Wall Street law firm to marry . She went on to produce children at an alarming rate , filling up her own house on Rogers Avenue in Marwood with demanding babies , never stopping to consider that her husband was just a manager in a coke-oven factory , with a salary that in other circumstances would have been respectable but with so many young ones underfoot could hardly be called sufficient . <p> Clara , however , was n't disturbed when expenses exceeded income . In many ways she proved herself a steadier character than her mother and her mother 's sisters and never once applied for a second mortgage , nor did she frequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she simply turned to her aunts for help , and with their occasional contributions the family was able to make ends meet , as the aunts said approvingly . <p> Into this family came the second Gabriella , blessed with her ancestor 's thick black hair and languorous beauty and so content with her lot that even as an infant she rarely cried , just made sweet gurgling sounds and grinned and waved her hands about like some splendid sea creature . Her good nature delighted the family , and they went out of the way to keep her happy , anticipating her needs with such vigilance that their bella Gabriella never learned what it meant to be disappointed . <p> In a room overlooking Riverside Drive in Manhattan , Sir Maxwell Smedley-Bark , retired major general of the British Army and descendant of an esteemed Scottish poet , is reading about himself . In Sir Maxwell 's decided opinion , reported correctly on the front page of today 's New York Times and continued on page 26 , " Propaganda is a mighty weapon , especially in the hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community and cast Senor Franco as the villain when in fact he is very quiet , unassuming , and congenial . " Yes , that 's what Sir Maxwell said to the reporter yesterday , and here it is , printed word for word . You can trust Sir Maxwell Smedley-Bark to know what he 's talking about . After all , he spent two months in Spain , covering 3,200 miles by automobile , from Malaga to the Bidassoa . " I look upon General Franco as the champion of Christianity against communism in Western Europe , " the quote continues . And for those in doubt , there 's this : Sir Maxwell secured a promise from Franco himself that " no Protestant in Spain will ever be molested for his religion . " How about that for a diplomatic plum ! <p> Can Sir Maxwell help it if the leaders of the world confide in him ? He inherited his great-grandsire 's way with words , and he is spending his golden years traveling the globe in pursuit of peace , a rare treasure indeed ! In Spain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priests and military personnel , on up to General Franco himself , who proved a remarkably agreeable officer as well as a tobacco connoisseur , which made for a delightful after-supper smoke . <p> Here in New York , on business relating to the Bank of England , Sir Maxwell was laid up in the hospital for nearly a week with a frightful intestinal infection . As soon as he had sufficiently recuperated he moved into this bank-owned fiat and agreed to an interview . As it turned out , the Memorial Day parade had thumped and trumpeted along Riverside Drive all morning long yesterday , sending up fanfare through the open window while Sir Maxwell held forth . <p> " The churches are full . There is absolute law and order and peace behind Franco 's lines . " At some point , perhaps before this last declaration , perhaps afterward , he 'd wandered to the window to peruse a military band passing below , and with his back to his visitor he 'd delivered this verse of his forefather , Sir Maxwell Bark : <p> preMothers hold their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Of he who urges men to war , With drooping heads to die in gore . But poetry apparently meant nothing to the journalist , who had omitted the verse from his transcription . Like most newsmen he 'd wanted controversy , not literature ; slogans , not eloquence . Well , Sir Maxwell had given him slogans . " The world is fooled ! Propaganda is so frightfully clever . Franco is no dictator , nor is he a fascist . You can see the light of understanding in his eyes . " The light of understanding ! Sir Maxwell had poetry in his blood , and if he could n't devote himself to the art , he could , at the tip of a hat , use the art to enliven his opinions . The light of understanding in his eyes . He imagined General Franco 's pleasure when he heard about the interview . He imagined his own name spoken with admiration by strangers . Best of all , he imagined a lovely young American wife sitting in the lavish living room of her Park Avenue apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to appreciate Sir Maxwell 's eloquence . <p> In the kitchen of the Brown family house on Rogers Avenue in Marwood , the two old sisters drink their thin coffee laced with Schenley 's Supreme and chatter about yesterday 's adventures : they had gone into the city to watch the parade and then to meet the French liner Normandie in hopes of catching a glimpse of Gloria Swanson , who was said to be returning from Europe . Well , they had n't seen the grande dame herself , but they 'd had plenty of fun matching three longshoremen dime for dime in craps . Then they 'd gone to the matinee of Lost Horizon at the Globe on 46th Street , only to find the photoplay sold out , so instead they saw Henry Travers playing Grandpa Vanderhof in You Ca n't Take It with You at the Booth , two hours plus spent in such scientifically-cooled comfort that both sisters had promptly nodded off at intermission and slept through to the end . <p> " Aunties , " Clara says , addressing them as usual in the plural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go . " She slides a plate of buttered toast into the center of the table and sits down to join them . The aunts plan to spend today at Belmont Park , where Clara 's brother Tony will be sure to treat them to lunch and share a tip when they place their bets . For a minute they munch in silence , crumbs collecting in the cracks of their lips , and Clara stares through the screen door at the backyard , her expression dazed and yet wistful , suggesting that exhausted as she is after raising six children , she would readily start at the beginning and relive every moment . <p> " You 'll bring Gabriella back with you this evening , " Clara reminds her aunts . It is Gabriella 's birthday today , and the family will gather to celebrate . Beautiful , serene Gabriella . What will become of her ? All she has to do is rest her gaze on a man and he 'll melt . The trick , the aunts agree , will be to help her find the suitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is time for all that , plenty of time . Their bella Gabriella is only twenty , still a precious little girl to them , as marvelous as a fairy child with gauzy wings hidden inside her dress . <p> " And remember , do n't let on , " Clara says , for the party tonight is supposed to be a surprise . <p> " Do n't spill the beans , Sister , " says the elder aunt . <p> " Do n't let the cat out of the bath , " remarks the other . <p> " The bag ! " the first corrects , and the two old women snort merrily , delighted to try out such time-tested sayings . <p> By noon , Sir Maxwell has reread the article at least a dozen times . Reading about oneself is comparable to feasting on frog legs and calves ' brains , he thinks , shaping the newspaper into a tube . The idea of such exposure might be distasteful in theory , but in actuality a man will be pleased when his words are presented in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to his relief that dull reporter has produced a tempting meal . <p> Which reminds Sir Maxwell as he tucks the newspaper beneath his seat that he has been waiting intolerably long for service in this New York chophouse . He 's been sitting here nearly thirty minutes , yet the restaurant is half empty . With the aplomb so typical of the serving class in this country , his waitress looks right past him every time he raises his hand . <p> He is about to call the maitre d ' when the girl arrives with a pitcher of fresh water laced with lemon slices . All right , then : he will complain directly to her and is preparing to do just that in his angriest baritone , but he stops short before uttering a single word , for as he stares at her he feels himself suddenly on the edge of a great cliff . He wants to look down to the floor to diminish the vertigo but can not tear his eyes from her face , for this chophouse waitress is , without a doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preImmortal lady born to liveIn blazing glory , let me giveMy love to you .... If he had the wherewithal he would have spoken these lines aloud to her . Instead , he snaps his mouth closed . Here before him , beauty so pure it is deadly to the man who tries to make it his own . And yet he will try . He must try . In the brown pools of her eyes he sees two foolish graybeards , himself reflected twice , a knight doomed to be spurned and yet loving her all the more for her indifference , a man who in that instant experiences a profound humility , seeing in this girl 's eyes , narrowed by the force of her polite smile , his terrible insignificance , sixty-seven years adding up to nothing . <p> So this is love . It is enough to break a stronger man and will break Sir Maxwell at that moment when he allows himself to give up on her . Never before has desire been mixed with such despair ; never before has he truly loved another human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little to him finally  --  the pain he felt upon leaving her was sweet , the memory of his pleasure a kind of souvenir he could revive from time to time . There will be no souvenirs from this brutal love , only terror as suspicion hardens into the certainty that the waitress will remain separate from him , unmoved by his suffering ; though it would n't matter even if she did come to like him , or even love him , for she could never love him enough . <p> prePaladin , cursed by eerie love , Doth seek his blessed cushat-dove ; Upon the wind her doleful soundIs heard , though she will ne'er be found . His only hope is to confess , without delay , his adoration . It would do no good courting her with an account of his honors , mere hindrances to him now , like an elaborate costume on a drowning man . Perhaps , though , the girl will take pity on him when he describes this newborn terror and the transformation that has occurred in him . Why , Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must tell her exactly what he wants with , out startling her , the lovely creature , without wasting another precious minute  --  <p> " I 'll have the rack , Miss . Pinkish . And bring me a whiskey sour . Do n't dawdle now . I do n't have all day ! " <p> How could he have spoken to her like that , as though she were just an ordinary chophouse waitress and he were n't devastated by love ? Idiot , courting her with tyranny and a sneer and thus destroying any shred of affection that might have been stirred by kinder words . Come back , come back ! But she is already heading toward the kitchen , lost to a first impression that can never be undone , her indifference calcifying into contempt even as she walks away to fetch him what he wants . <p> His only solace is this thought : that she will spit into his drink , giving him a chance to taste her sweet soul . Ah , he 'd rather taste the salty surface of her skin , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he tries to imagine stepping out of time into the dreamworld where she would make herself available to him , tries to picture her in place of his mistress Magdalena lying naked on the bed . But the real place he 's in oppresses with its rattling air conditioners and its dim electric chandeliers , so he closes his eyes against the scene , opens them again a lifetime later and finds before him his drink . He eats the speared cherry first , then sips the whiskey , taking in only enough to wet his tongue , for he wants to make this drink last , along with the others that will follow , each full glass an excuse to keep him sitting in this restaurant . He 'll sit here all afternoon , all evening , all night and into the morrow . He 'll sit here until he turns to dust . <p> Class C , one-thousand-dollar purse on the Widener course , and with Stout on top of Deep End there 's no telling what could happen . Jolly Jack breaks too quickly and drops , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ End the aunts have their money on  --  against Tony 's advice-for Deep End is a handsome , high-stepping horse , a plucky sprinter who last week ran third and usually does even worse but today has that look of ambition in his eye . Indeed , he seizes the lead at the quarter post and holds it , increases his advantage at the last sixteenth , coming under the wire a half-length ahead of Suntime . And that 's at 20-1 odds at the last call-over ! <p> Lucky as gypsies , these two sisters , with their fistfuls of cash . They count their money dollar by dollar and then send it back , putting it all on Dundrillon in the second heat , though the four-year-old gelding unfairly carries 151 pounds . Dundrillon runs sixth , the aunts are penniless again , and there 's not even time to watch the next race , for they 've promised Clara they 'll pick up Gabriella and bring her to her birthday party . <p> " Ciao , Aunties , " Tony calls after giving them each a dollar for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he , like his aunts , usually comes out no better than even at the end of the day . Right now he 's down fifty bucks , and his mustache , sticky with sweat , looks like it 's been dipped in molasses . <p> " Do n't be late , " the younger aunt says . <p> " Clara is expecting you , " the older one reminds him . But Tony is too busy studying the call-board and jotting down numbers in the margins of his racing form to reply , so the aunts blow him a kiss and hurry off , bumping each other with their broad hips as they turn and letting out such peals of laughter that an evangelist in the crowd shakes his head grimly at the sight of these two old spinster sinners who are obviously long past saving . <p> Sir Maxwell cuts into the lamb , finds it brown at the center but does not complain . In fact , he 's glad the chops were plucked late from the griddle , for this gives him a chance to make up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a gentleman ; he will accept whatever hand life deals him , be it an unreachable girl or chops that are brown rather than pink . He leaves a fair amount of meat on the bones in hopes that the waitress will notice the cook 's error . But the girl is nowhere to be seen . Instead , the busboy , a freckled lad of sixteen or so , clears the table , brushing bread crumbs off the linen with a series of quick diagonal strokes that suggest a powerful disdain . Has the waitress warned the boy about Sir Maxwell , the peevish old man at the corner table ? Perhaps all the workers in this restaurant have heard from her that the gentleman who ordered the rack is a scoundrel , and so all of them have agreed to treat him with cruel civility . <p> " Dessert , sir ? " <p> " Eh , what 's that ? " <p> " Dessert ? " <p> " No . Yes . Where 's my waitress ? " <p> " Should I send her over ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tell me , boy , what 's her name ? " <p> " Marshall Johnson , sir . " <p> " Marshall ? What kind of name is that for a girl ? " <p> To Sir Maxwell 's astonishment , the busboy turns about-face and stalks off , treating the major general to a double dose of contempt . Can it be so ? Is the entire establishment conspiring to make a fool of him ? On any other day he would insist on speaking to the person in charge , but today he wishes to avoid making a scene and is quite dismayed when he sees the maitre d ' approaching , surely to apologize for the busboy 's rudeness . Sir Maxwell decides to preempt him by dismissing the incident altogether : " I say , an apology is n't necessary . " <p> " But it is , " replies the maitre d ' , a thin , reptilian fellow who smells faintly , Sir Maxwell thinks , of mothballs . <p> " I 'd rather forget the matter . " <p> " In all deference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the maitre d ' persists . " In this country , you see ... " and he goes on to explain certain expectations Americans have , whatever their station-most importantly , that males expect to be addressed as males and females as females . But Sir Maxwell ca n't quite follow the gist , for he 's still pondering the " boy " that preceded Johnson , and in the private chaos wrought by the misunderstanding he wonders whether the waitress , so quaintly named Marshall Johnson , is actually a he . <p> " Yes , yes , of course , " he says , motioning with his hand as if to wave away a gnat , for he ca n't think clearly with the man rambling on . <p> " Otherwise , sir , I 'll have to ask you to leave , " the maitre d ' says , straightening his spine , obviously emboldened by the threat . <p> " You what ! " Sir Maxwell rises from his chair , unable to resist the challenge , hearing in his head his own voice chant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for when pushed to the wall he 's a proud old dog . " Do you know who I am ? " He picks up the newspaper and smacks it back down on the table . " Can you even guess ? " By now the scene he had wanted to avoid is drawing wondering and disapproving glances from around the room ; the waitresses have stopped serving , the customers have stopped talking , and Sir Maxwell stands at the center of attention , pathetic in his rage . <p> " Good Lord , " he says , blotting sweat away with a napkin . " I 'm mistaken "  --  for in a flash he has understood . " The busboy . . . the boy 's name .. , he must have .. , why , he misheard my question , for I was asking about .. , about "  --  he searches the room and points  --  " her ! " All eyes follow the line of his forefinger a few yards to Gabriella Brown , who alone among his audience is smiling , as though she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat forced laughter , Sir Maxwell and the maitre d ' put the pieces of the misunderstanding back into proper order while Gabriella looks on from a distance . Sir Maxwell learns her name from the maitre d ' , who whispers it and adds , " She 's a dandy server , but what an oddball ! " touching his forehead to indicate the source of her strangeness . " The owner took a fancy to her when she came in to apply for the job , " the maitre d ' explains . " He did n't much care that she kept her thoughts to herself . Hired her anyway . " As in most such cases of doomed love , her mystery only makes her more intriguing to her infatuated customer , and over a glass of champagne , compliments of the house , Sir Maxwell lets himself believe that when he finally leaves the restaurant , he 'll leave with her . <p> By the time the two aunts arrive at the restaurant , Gabriella , finished with her shift , is onto her third martini and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently , to Sir Maxwell , who is boasting about the bottle of port he brought General franco  --  put down in 1855 . Sir Maxwell has been sipping whiskey sours since lunch , and now the tip of his nose is the same blush-red as the candied cherry in his drink . Ho ho ho , he laughs , oblivious to the similarity between himself and that old charmer St. Nick . The aunts watch quietly for a few minutes , waiting for him to work his magic . When they see , however , that he 's casting his spell with Bombay gin and that the twinkle in his eye has an avaricious gleam , they decide to interrupt . <p> " Ah , bella Gabriella , " they sing , taking turns squeezing her chin in their plump hands and kissing her cheeks . " Are you well ? " the elder asks , and the younger barks , " Are you done for the day ? " and then they tell her about their luck at the track , clearly expecting no reply , happy just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face enough to make the most tedious subject seem marvelous . And without pausing in their account , they each take an arm and lift Gabriella right out of her chair , for they intend to catch the 6:05 from Pennsylvania Station . <p> " Hello there , not so quickly ! " Sir Maxwell cries , placing his bulky self in front of the women . <p> " Pardon me , Santa , " says the elder sister . <p> " We have to go , " says the younger . <p> " But we 've been having such good fun , " he persists . " Do n't take her away . " <p> " We have a train to catch . " <p> " So if you excuse us  --  " <p> " Why do n't we let our lovely princess decide ? " Sir Maxwell suggests . <p> " Oh , that will be one day ! " retorts the elder . <p> " The day , " corrects the younger , attempting to nudge father Christmas out of the way with her elbow . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is useless when it becomes necessary to direct a situation toward an appropriate conclusion . The aunts will have to reckon with this opponent themselves  --  they 'd better make quick work of him or they 'll miss their train . <p> Gabriella slips back into her seat while the old women contemplate Sir Maxwell . " Shall we ... " begins the elder . <p> " Play ? " fills in the younger . <p> The elder huffs ; the younger shrugs . Then they grin the grin of familial conspiracy , and their faces suddenly seem flooded with light , as though a windowshade has been raised . <p> " I suppose there 's time , " says the younger . <p> " There is always time , " replies the elder . <p> " For cards , " explains the younger , " we always have time . " <p> " We do like cards . " <p> " A freezeout game of five card stud  --  " <p> " Eh , what 's that ? " Sir Maxwell interrupts . <p> " A freezeout game of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rattles off the rules : two players , one hundred matchsticks for each , bets no higher than twenty , outside dealer , and the winner wins Gabriella for the evening . <p> Sir Maxwell , for once in his life , is speechless , muddled by the proposal . But with the stakes so high he ca n't refuse . He accepts the challenge , though he insists on using a deck supplied by the restaurant and appointing the dealer himself : who else but Gabriella ! She tucks her head against her shoulder for a moment as if to hide her smile , the kind of smile a child will flash when a stranger praises her drawing . " Are you able ? " Sir Maxwell asks , almost pleading , and she giggles . <p> The aunts see nothing wrong with these terms , so they pull up chairs at the table where Sir Maxwell has been entertaining Gabriella with his stories . The maitre d ' brings a deck of cards and snaps his fingers for the busboy . Once the table has been cleared of glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Maxwell and the older aunt sitting to her sister 's right and slightly behind . Gabriella treats the cards with a tenderness other girls would save for an arrangement of fresh flowers . Sir Maxwell lifts the card she lays face down in front of him , sniffs it with dreamy pleasure , and puts it back on the table . The younger aunt examines her card while the elder looks on , then returns it to its place , and together they let out an enigmatic sigh when their next card , face up , turns out to be the king of diamonds . <p> " You did say two players , ladies , " Sir Maxwell reminds them , and the elder aunt leans back and folds her arms beneath the precipice of her bosom . The younger counts out six matchsticks ; Sir Maxwell sees her and , upon being dealt the ace of hearts for his third card , raises her ten .

Sir Maxwell counts out five matchsticks and pushes them toward the center . The elder aunt lights a cigarette and passes it to the younger , who inhales deeply as Gabriella deals her a second eight , this time of clubs . The younger aunt counts out fifteen sticks . Sir Maxwell raises her five . Her fourth card up is a jack , and she raises him ten , then calls .

Gabriella deals Sir Maxwell another king , and he counts out twenty matches . The aunt receives the ten of clubs and sees him . Sir Maxwell 's fourth card is the five of diamonds , the aunt 's the jack of clubs . Sir Maxwell bets another bold twenty matchsticks to make up for his losses . The aunt receives a fourth club and raises him five . Sir Maxwell raises her with the rest of his hoard and calls .

The family emerges in a pack from the dining room , the children rush forward to grab Gabriella 's legs , her brothers and their wives dance across the rug , Uncle Trip trips over a footstool and lands , fortunately , on the sofa , Uncle Tony wears his hat at a swarthy tilt until Clara grabs it , Gabriella 's father holds the cake lit with twenty candles , and the aunts stand with their arms around Gabriella 's waist while she shakes with soft laughter , clearly grateful for the party and yet amused , as though she thought love a comic thing , the grandest jest a person could play on the world . And while no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't care , for together they have created this silence , nurtured it , and will go on protecting it , keeping this secret , indescribable treasure to themselves . <p> <p> By JOANNA SCOTT <p>
