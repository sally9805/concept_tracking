The National Park Service is hampered by a lack of knowledge about the ecological makeup of the parks . <p> RESEARCH BIOLOGIST David Graber can not find his frog . He knows it was here  --  somewhere  --  in Sequoia National Park , but nobody has seen the foothill yellow-legged frog in the park since the late 1970s . No one warned of the amphibian 's impending demise ; the creature passed unnoticed from the California park . No one realized the frog was gone until the mid-1980s ; repeated checks failed to turn up any specimens . <p> Not only is Graber 's frog apparently gone from Sequoia , but any theories that could explain why are simply conjecture . Still , it is a measure of inventory efforts at the park that the disappearance of the frog was noticed at all . Some species " lost " in one national park may be " found " in another . For instance , even though the foothill yellow-legged frog is no longer in Sequoia National Park , it survives elsewhere . The discovery that a species is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Graber , research biologist at Sequoia , unless a species has been declared en dangered and is , therefore , being carefully monitored . <p> Most people think that national parks have been thoroughly studied for years , and that they are immutable preserves with species well understood . This notion is not only wrong but dangerously misleading . Quite simply , the National Park Service ( NPS ) suffers from an embarrassing lack of knowledge about the species in its parks . And as the 1992 Science in the National Parks study states , " Informed resource management is impossible without science in its broadest sense  --  that is , the acquisition , analysis , and dissemination of knowledge about natural processes and about the human influences on them . " <p> More than a dozen other studies issued over the past few decades by NPCA , the National Academy of Sciences , and the Park Service itself all suggest that there is a woeful lack of information about the species that live in and depend on the parks . <p> Although land-use decisions should be based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living where and what sorts of changes will affect their survival , NPS efforts to catalog species and gather scientific information about them are scattered at best . In fact , no national park has ever been the subject of a complete biological inventory . <p> Because information is sparse or nonexistent , " lots of species could be disappearing and we would n't even know about it , " says Thomas J. Stohlgren , ecologist and global change research coordinator for the Park Service 's Colorado Rockies biogeographical area . " They never appeared on our species lists . " <p> The Clinton Administration has ambitious plans to change this through a program of shared science called the National Biological Survey . Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt plans a more aggressive approach to preserving ecosystems and wildlife , involving a campaign to reverse years of underfunding and neglect in research programs . But it remains to be seen how this program , which got under way in October , will affect the Park Service . The effort will be nothing if not an uphill climb . <p> In 1992 , working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the University of California at Davis , Stohlgren drew attention to the poor state of biotic inventories in 40 Western national parks and monuments . They found that species lists for most of the parks are less than 80 percent complete . " Only a small number of parks are doing systematic inventories , " says Stohlgren . But when they are able to do them , researchers can sometimes increase significantly the number of listed species . Over the past decade , a handful of these parks added 1,439 vascular plants , 111 birds , and 15 mammals not previously recorded . <p> Even these new lists may be insufficient . The two researchers found that classification and sampling schemes are inconsistent from one park to another . This discrepancy hampers understanding of particular species , which in turn affects the Park Service 's ability to make sound management decisions . In the past , exotic fish were introduced to improve recreational opportunities without thought to the implications for native species . And because of a lack of scientific information , fires were suppressed in the parks , leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition , plants other than trees and creatures such as insects receive little if any attention . " I think we 've done a good job of surveying ... the charismatic megafauna , the bears , elk , wolves , and other large animals . But we 've done a pretty miserable job on the rest , " says Stohlgren . About half of the parks surveyed in the 1992 study reported essentially no research on invertebrates or nonvascular plants  --  major components in maintaining the health of an ecosystem . <p> In fact , " Lots of parks have no formal biological studies at all , " says Quinn . But compiling even a partial inventory for any one park would be a full-time job for a number of years , he says . " There is no right way to do this , and that is one of the problems , " he adds . " The way to think about biological surveys is that we know almost nothing . We have little bright spots of knowledge in a sea of ignorance . " <p> A yet-to-be-published nationwide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maps of vegetation , soils , or geology . It reviewed natural resource information from 252 national parks and monuments and was conducted by Stohlgren , Quinn , Gary Waggoner of the NPS Geographic Information Division , and Michael Ruggiero , chief of the NPS Wildlife and Vegetation Division , who is now on loan to the National Biological Survey . <p> Lack of detailed information is so pervasive that when a 1986 article appeared in Ecology magazine charging that nearly 40 species had vanished from many parks , NPS had to scramble to refute the charges . The author had relied on outdated , confusing park records as a basis for his article . In some instances , a number of the species in question had never been in the parks . In other cases , individual park employees knew the species were alive and well , but NPS had no written records to offer as proof . The Park Service was unable to gather enough data to disprove the charges until 1992 , six years after the article first appeared . <p> " We really know much less about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public expects , " says Quinn . " You would think that you can call up and find out where in the parks we have red foxes , but I can assure you ... we often just do n't know . <p> Smaller parks share these problems and frequently have even fewer resources to either inventory or monitor their plant and wildlife populations . Even so , these areas provide habitat crucial to a variety of creatures and plants , a point underscored by Stohlgren and Quinn in a 1991 study comparing six small northern California national park units with Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Parks . <p> For a park of any size , however , the rule for many years has been species management by crisis , says Bob Cunningham , general superintendent of the NPS Southern Arizona Group in Phoenix . " As management problems come up , we prevail on our scientists or on university scientists to do a study , " says Cunningham . " Where the problem is reasonably obvious , we devote our resources to it , but we are not blessed with anything left over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For instance , he says , " We 're not surveying reptiles . " <p> Because they are comparatively undisturbed , parklands are ideal places to monitor phenomena such as global climate change , ozone layer depletion , and pollution . But funding for science has always been a problem . " Only 2.3 percent of our NPS budget goes to support scientific research ... , " Stohlgren says . " Good industrial companies often spend at least 10 percent on research and development . We 've been spending about one-fifth of that for years . " In 1992 , the Park Service 's inventory and monitoring program received about $2 million to $3 million in funding , expanding to $4 million to $5 million with the 1993 program . To position itself to receive the funding it needs , the Park Service began an inventory pilot program , which will cost more than $20 million . The total needed to reverse years of neglect and underfunding would be more than $200 million . <p> While the problems seem overwhelming , the Park Service 's science program has had some bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coast of southern California , research marine biologist Gary E. Davis and his colleagues are actively studying 500 of the 2,000 or so species in the park , including 100 marine varieties . <p> Davis is assembling what he calls an early warning system for endangered species and ecosystems at Channel Islands . Rather than waiting for crises to develop for wild populations , Davis gathers information on selected species on a routine basis to construct baseline information . <p> " There are n't many long-term ecological monitoring efforts in the parks , " says Davis . " We tend to work mostly with theory  --  testing these theories with observation is rare . Part of why we need long-term observation in the national parks is to be able to make better predictions of what will happen when we change these systems . " <p> That changes will take place in park ecosystems is a given , but what Davis hopes to provide is a better understanding of where these changes lead over time . He points to the fishing industry , which reduced several species of abalone in succession nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , white , and , finally , black abalone all have been exhausted along the southern California coastline , says Davis . Although some areas were closed to abalone harvesting 15 years ago , the stocks have not recovered . Whether this is due primarily to continued poaching or to some fundamental change in the ecosystem remains unclear . These are the kinds of questions Davis hopes to answer , and these are the kinds of disappearances he hopes to prevent with an early warning system . <p> In creating more comprehensive inventories and early warning systems , the Park Service does not have to go it alone . Some of the most promising efforts to date are cooperations between the Park Service and The Nature Conservancy . For 18 years , the Conservancy has been building an international network of biodiversity data centers , called National Heritage Programs . In 1987 , Great Smoky Mountains National Park became the first national park to adopt The Conservancy 's program . " Before we had a heritage program , a lot of our information was in the brains of employees who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Great Smoky 's supervisory natural resource specialist . " There was no institutional memory ; there was no logical way to prioritize species for monitoring and protection . " <p> By cataloging species ' rarity in 82 centers across the Western Hemisphere , the heritage program provides a rational way to establish priorities for species protection . For instance , says Langdon , " we knew gnome finger lichen was found around the Southern Appalachians , but apparently most of the species is found within park boundaries . Recent heritage information says it has declined outside the park ; we do n't know why . " Because of this information , says Langdon , they decided to raise the priority for monitoring the lichen . <p> Combining in-park inventories with those outside has such value that other parks are now cooperating with The Nature Conservancy . This year , NPS is providing logistical support to the effort to found the Greater Yellowstone Conservation Data Center , headquartered in Mammoth Hot Springs . The center will inventory species throughout the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem , including two national parks , the John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Land Management lands , U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service refuges , and private holdings . <p> In addition to the programs already under way , the Park Service will benefit from the National Biological Survey ( NBS ) , which took over much of inventory and monitoring design work with improved funding aimed specifically at science on U.S. public lands , including completion of a species inventory . <p> Since 1885 , the United States has struggled to complete a biological survey  --  against apparently overwhelming odds . A Division of Economic Ornithology and Mammalogy formed in the Department of Agriculture in 1885 , evolving into the Bureau of Biological Survey , only to disappear into the Interior Department 's Fish and Wildlife Service in 1940 . A poorly funded and nearly unknown Office of Biological Services survived within Fish and Wildlife until 1986 . <p> This year , the Clinton Administration decided to try again . Interior Secretary Babbitt suggested the idea for the National Biological Survey , which would include research scientists from Fish and Wildlife and NPS , as well as from other Interior agencies . <p> Earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a paper titled : " The National Biological Survey : An Agenda Driven by Biotic Resource Trends , " which gives some indications of the direction this agency may take in meeting its objectives . Davis identifies four threats to natural ecosystems : unsustainable consumption rates of resources , such as ancient forests and fishery stocks ; land-use practices that fragment habitats ; human alteration of air , water , and soil that destabilizes ecosystems ; and the spread of alien species . <p> To help deal with these threats , NBS will develop techniques for restoring ecosystems ; devise better measures of a system 's dynamics , including the roles played in those systems by various species ; create models for predicting ecosystem behavior ; and develop the best approaches to manage these systems . <p> The boundaries of parks are only lines on maps . Because species are affected by land-use changes outside the parks as well as within them , the Park Service will surely benefit from these cooperative species inventory efforts . " We have a lot to learn about the plants and animals in our national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how healthy they are , and what roles they play , " says the Park Service 's Stohlgren . " That information affects every important decision we make . " <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : The Park Service 's efforts to catalog species are scattered at best , unless the creature has been declared endangered , such as the Florida panther , and is being carefully monitored . Fires , a necessary ingredient in the sequoia 's ability to reproduce , were suppressed for a time because of a lack of information . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The Park Service has gathered information on large mamals , such as beers , elk , and wolves , but has few data on birds such as the Louisiana heron , shown in the Everglades , or invertebrates , such as the moth ( Clodius parnassian ) at Crater Lake National Park . <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : The Park Service 's science program already has shown some signs of change .
