You ca n't game the Fed . For weeks on end I heard talking head after talking head spouting that the Federal Reserve Board was about to embark on a string of tightenings to cool down the economy . The Fed watchers had it all figured out . Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan had repeatedly leaked that the rollicking days of a strong economy were over . He was going to put the brakes on the longest peacetime advance with a series of rapid-fire interest-rate hikes that would send the stock market into a tizzy . <P> And would n't you know it , Greenspan was doing nothing of the sort . He was actually creating a month-long , super-duper buying opportunity . After all that hand-wringing , accompanied by a rocky sell-off of so many stock favorites , we get a wee little quarter-point hike and a flat statement saying the Fed is no longer biased toward tightening . Greenspan gave you a total green light to get long stocks . <P> The short-term takeaway is that those who were too bearish because they feared the mighty Fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomp on the brakes periodically . But remember , the Fed always favors prosperity long term  --  how could it not ? By removing the bias , Greenspan has removed the speed bumps , and if you waited until the all clear was sounded , you missed a true romp in the averages . <P> Yet there is a longer-term takeaway that is much more important for you to understand . So much of the do-it-yourself financial revolution that has gripped this country is incredibly positive . The combination of cheap commissions and readily available information has empowered individuals to take better care of their finances , in many cases , than a broker or adviser ever could . <P> Now the problem is overload  --  too much data , too many reports , too many experts looking for " tendencies " as if they were football coaches and the Federal Reserve an NFL team . For weeks , it seems , the nation was on " Fed watch , " as commentator after commentator opined on the Fed 's desire to cool things down . ( For the record , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market this week so you would not have to think about Greenspan &; Co . ) <P> The Fed Chairman used to walk to his meetings virtually unnoticed , just another Washington bureaucrat . Last week there were a dozen cameras and reporters dogging his every step . If you followed these sometimes frightening prognosticators , you might have been turned from an investor to a trader , spooking out of high-quality stocks because you feared a Fed action that in another era would n't have meant a hill of beans to you . Some of these know-it-alls had you believing that the stock market was the Fed 's enemy . <P> Yet in the end the Fed is a place where secrets are kept . In the end nobody knew what it would do . If you sold stocks because you were so wired to the financial world that you feared a Fed action that did not occur , you cost yourself a bundle . The lesson , of course , is that if you have done your homework about your equities and you know what stocks you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fed 's every move . <P> If you do , you may be worrying too much about your stocks . This week showed that that can be just as financially punishing as not . <P> Cramer manages a hedge fund and writes for
