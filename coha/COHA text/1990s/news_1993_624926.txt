<p> Lorrie Morgan 's singing certainly qualifies her as a country music star , but that 's not enough . <p> Morgan wants to be a movie star . <p> It 's been her dream since she was a little girl watching her idols , Bette Davis and Joan Crawford , on the silver screen . <p> And finally , this Monday , Morgan gets her chance . Not exactly on the silver screen but a starting run at it , anyway . She 's making her acting debut in a made-for-TV mini-movie on The Nashville Network . Curtain goes up at 9 p.m. , with repeat at 1 a.m <p> " " Proudheart " is tailored to Morgan 's talents , and it fits her fine . It 's a performance Morgan can be proud of . She comes off better than some of her country sisters who 've tried that crossover . <p> " " Proudheart " lets Morgan be herself , without asking her to stretch too much in any untoward direction . <p> It 's the viewers who do the stretching with this movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Proudheart " was written as a 90-minute drama , a kind of pilot project for a string of very low-budget , made-in-Nashville movies that TNN hopes to add to its original programming list . <p> There are about six more of these , with as many country stars , ready to start production if the viewers give " " Proudheart " their stamp of approval . <p> But a funny thing happened to " " Proudheart " on the way to the TV screens . Half an hour 's worth of script got lost and was never shot . <p> " " We ran into a snowstorm ( no kidding ) and into a lot of other things that caused our costs to go up , " TNN program director C. Paul Corbin said . " " So we just ended up with a solid hourlong special . And we think that 's significant enough to test the concept . " <p> It 's obvious that shortening the show to an hour meant lopping off some key scenes that would have held the story together . This story is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own storytelling to make it work . <p> There are no fancy trappings about it , but it 's not a story that needs fancy trappings . It looks quite good , considering it was made on a Nashville shoestring . <p> They did leave Morgan 's two songs in  --  " " I Always Do " and a lullaby . She wrote them . <p> Morgan plays Sam ( as in Samantha ) Farmer , a single mother with sweet daughter ( Nancy Moore Atchison ) . As the movie opens , she 's getting an emergency phone call at the big auto plant where she works in the city . <p> Back in her little hometown of Proudheart , Tenn. , her daddy has died . <p> Sam loved her father dearly , but she does n't know until she goes home for his funeral that the old-fashioned filling station he owned had fallen on such hard times . <p> Sam and her mother , played by Collin Wilcox-Paxton , have not hit it off that well over the years . Mama 's been " " away " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for her husband 's funeral , daughter Sam figures she 's beyond the point of being any help at straightening out the family finances . <p> So Sam does it herself and does it her way . <p> For Morgan , this role " " was like going home again . " <p> " " What drew me to it was that it was so close to my own life , " she said at TNN 's Hollywood briefing . " " It 's all the things I 've been through in my own life . " Her father was George Morgan , longtime Grand Ole Opry star , and when little Lorrie made her singing debut with him at age 13 , she earned an Opry house standing ovation . <p> " " From that moment on , I knew that was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life , " she said . <p> When her father died in 1975 , though , he left an unexpected legacy  --  a lot of the same things that Sam 's movie father leaves behind . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Morgan said . " " My mother struggled very hard to deal with it in her own way , and as I got a little older , I felt like I needed to take on the whole world myself , and take care of my mom and my sisters and everyone in my family . " <p> The most emotional scene in the movie is the one where Sam and her mother confront each other 's resentments . " " It was so very , very much like my real life , " she said . " " When I did it ( and she did it very well ) , I just thought of my own mother and father . " <p> After her father died , Morgan toured with George Jones for a couple of years . But those were such lean times that she took bankruptcy at one point . She also dealt with a tragedy when her husband , singer Keith Whitley , died of alcohol poisoning in 1989 . <p> By that time , she had two daughters and a new song , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the charts . <p> People thought she wrote the song about her late husband , but she did n't . " " It was released before Keith passed away , " she said . <p> " " Unfortunately , everybody thought we put that song out to get a lot of sympathy for me , and that 's not really what happened . The record was on the charts before . <p> " " I do n't know , " she said , " " maybe it did get me more publicity than I normally would have gotten . But I do think if Keith were still alive today , I would still have had the success I 'm having today , because it is a dream I 've wanted since I was a child , and I was n't going to stop until I got it . " <p> Being an actress was the other dream she 'd nurtured all those years , and her managers have been looking hard to find a good script to make that dream come true . <p> " " We just could n't find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So after a long time looking , they finally decided to have someone write something especially for me . The script was sent to me out on the road , and I was very moved by it . I thought it was very down-to-earth and something that country music fans and middle-class folks could relate to . " <p> She wanted to write some songs for it , but there was n't much time to for writing . " " My road manager , Mike Chamberlain , and I sat on the bus a couple of days , and I wrote one about myself . " ( That 's " " I Always Do . ) " She wrote the lullaby , too , for her daughters , but she wrote it to go into an album . The producers liked it and decided to put it in the movie . <p> Now that she 's done it , Morgan would like to do another movie . But she 'll go into the next one a lot wiser about what she 's getting into . <p> " " From the outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they really are , " she declared with a laugh . <p> " " Growing up , I always thought actors and actresses were treated like kings and queens on the sets . <p> " " I was in a for a rude awakening , " she said . " " It was very hard . <p> " " That last week of the shoot , we had probably one of the worst snowstorms Nashville ever had in March , the worst blizzard of the century . And we just kept shooting . I was frozen . There was nothing glamorous about it . <p> " " It was a lot of hard work , hours of hurry up and wait . It was like doing a video , except magnified 120 times . When I 'm onstage performing , I 'm in total control and everything I do is my call . But in this , I was taking direction from somebody else , " she said . " " That 's a whole lot different from calling your own shots . "
