Caller number 10 to Fob James ' radio call-in show is upset . a huge cross that stood on state-owned property along a highway in Gulf Shores , Alabama , was taken down under a federal court order , and Caller 10 wants to know how to get permission to put it back up . Now , Fob James has a lawyer right here in the studio to advise on pesky issues like church-state conflict . But James does n't turn to his lawyer . He just leans into the mike and issues marching orders : " Get your cross , just like the one that was there , go on back there , and put it back up . I 'll tell ' em you 're on your way . " James can do that . Heck , he 's the Governor . <P> Heck , he 's Fob James . The Republican landslide that transformed the U.S. Congress last fall also ushered in a gaggle of ardent G.O.P. conservatives in state capitals around the country . But James , 60 , is more a throwback than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months in office loading up one discarded policy of the Old South after the other and lobbing them at Alabama 's moderates , minorities and , yes , at the federal judiciary . " We are going in the same direction as the rest of the country , but we are more extreme , " says Auburn University professor Wayne Flynt . <P> Certainly that describes James ' penal philosophy , unveiled in April , when Alabama became the nation 's first state to restore the prison chain gang , putatively as an " experiment . " Last week , judging the experiment successful , the James administration began strapping leg irons every day on 160 prisoners at the Limestone Correctional Facility so they could be sent to break rocks with sledgehammers . <P> Lest local civil-liberties lawyers tire of cruel-and-unusual punishment cases , however , James has also engaged them in the First Amendment arena . He has called for a law permitting school prayer ( not a moment of silent prayer , but the vocal kind ) . Specifically , he embraced the cause of Judge Roy Moore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his Etowah County courtroom . James not only raised money for Moore 's defense ; the Governor is suing the ACLU for suing Moore . <P> In fact , in true Alabama tradition , James is at war with the law . State and federal judges have , at one time or another , declared Alabama 's public schools , mental institutions and foster-care system constitutionally inadequate . Rather than giving in to judicial rulings he dislikes , James inveighs against " pygmy-headed , pea-brained so-called jurists , " harking back to the time when Governor George Wallace recommended " barbed-wire enemas " for federal judges . More substantively , James introduced a long-shot bill that would allow the legislature and the Governor to overturn rulings of the Alabama Supreme Court from which three or more judges dissent . Says Flynt : " He 's arguing philosophical points that have not been debated in 200 years . " <P> James is also upsetting another , more recent achievement . Alabama 's racial climate has improved steadily in recent years . But one of James ' first official acts this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an emotional issue in a state where many blacks remember the poll tax . Hard feelings were made worse when James initially named an all-white cabinet , only later adding one black  --  as tourism officer .
