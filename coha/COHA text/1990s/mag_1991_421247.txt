Section : watercolor PAGE <p> Although it is important to establish consistency in the subject matter , style , and technique used in painting , there is always the risk of becoming too predictable and  --  let 's face it  --  boring . After the thirty-fourth wet-in-wet floral or the fiftieth dry-brush barn , an artist risks losing the spark that holds his or her own interest , as well as the viewer 's . The challenge is therefore to find a way of approaching each painting with a freshness that conveys a feeling both for the subject and for the relationship between the subject and its environment . <p> For me , the answer to that challenge is to work with a variety of painting techniques and styles , always trying to find an appropriate way to express the feeling that attracted me me to subject . When I sat down to write this article , I spent many days trying to pinpoint exactly the dominant force behind my watercolors . I finally realized that instead of focusing on just one element , flighting , color , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diversity of styles and with a variety of subjects . <p> This fact is illustrated by my painting Simple Pleasures . The inspiration for this work was a line of white T-shirts I noticed on eight members of a family standing in a row on a summer afternoon . It was n't important to know the identities of these people or the reason that they were out walking in the stillness of that particular day ; what was important was the relationship of the individuals to one another and to their surroundings , and that 's why I chose to work on a wet surface that would allow the background and foreground to flow together . <p> In the beginning stages of this work , I masked out the shapes of the T-shirts , wet the watercolor board , and started dropping colors onto the damp surface . It was difficult to predict what the end result would be , but I am always willing to be flexible about how the image develops in a wet approach . Believe me , this was n't my first attempt at painting this subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effortless meant that I might have to make several attempts at the painting . In situations such as this , in which I feel a certain anxiety about the outcome of my effort , I often make two separate preliminary drawings before beginning the painting process . This helps ease the tension I feel about getting the watercolor to come out right the first time . <p> When working on this painting , I kept my palette full of nonstaining , or sedimentary , colors such as burnt umber and ultramarine blue . Sedimentary colors sit on the surface of the paper . Even though I work quickly with this kind of process I also want flexibility  --  the ability to move the colors around on the page or soften the edges  --  and these colors allow me to do so . <p> However , when I created Couple at City Market , I tool a different approach . What I found most interesting about this scene was the contrast between the strong presence of the couple in the foreground and the gestural quality of the people in the shadows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I believed that the best way to convey that would be by drawing with my brush . When I refer to drawing with my , brush , I 'm really talking about a state of mind or an attitude I take on , that allows me more control in my paintings . In fact , when I started thinking of my brush as an instrument of drawing in my tighter paintings , it helped me feel more comfortable with the painting process . I even keep a drafting eraser close to my palette in case I need to lighten strokes . The eraser does n't pick up a lot of color and it keeps the surface of the paper fairly intact . <p> When I work more realistically , I choose to slowly build up colors through transparent washes . This can be an extremely slow process , sometimes requiring twenty or thirty layers just to achieve the right value . I 've never felt too comfortable putting down a dark color , and this process has been an ideal way for me to produce a desired value . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the luminosity and subtlety of the watercolor . Even in larger paintings , I enjoy layering and find myself drawn to the small parts or shadow areas of the piece where I can keep adding traces of fresh color for some extra punch . <p> My palette for transparent washes is completely different from that of my wet approach . I work with transparent , somewhat staining colors : Thalo blue , Winsor red , sepia , new gamboge , alizarin crimson , and , occasionally , mauve . The problem some artists have when starting out in watercolor is they may want to layer their colors but are drawn to the more sedimentary paints . Of course , if you are sure of where and how to put down your strokes and can do it without laboring , you can work with almost any colors . But if , like me , you tend to pick at your work , you 'll discover that layering one sedimentary color over another will either create a muddy color or lift up the layer below it . <p> Recently , I developed an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been attracted to painting the great outdoors before . In the past , I had viewed landscapes in much the same way I photographed them : as panoramic scenes of vacation places . Obviously , I thought , there were so many fine landscape artists out there already , what could I offer anyone , or even myself , for that matter ? Then , one year , I traveled to the Southwest . The natural images were so immeasurably beautiful that I simply could n't take them all in at one glance . I found myself having to visually break things down into shapes and colors . This was an exciting revelation because I realized I could now incorporate the abstract colors and shapes I was seeing into the representational aspect of traditional landscpae painting . <p> As I became more comfortable with the subject matter found in nature , I also realized that things were less familiar to me that I had expected . When I was a child , I was taught that the sky was blue and the grass green , and few people challenged me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I started asking myself those kinds of questions so that I could really start seeing what I was trying to paint and , in turn , let viewers see these things as well . <p> When I first saw the stone wall that I painted in Quiet Moment , the sun was peeking through overhead clouds and shining on a small cluster of wild flowers . However , when I ran over to shoot my research photographs , the cloud cover returned . I stood patiently on the spot , waiting for a bit of sunlight to break through , but I finally relented and took the pictures under overcast skies . Back in the studio , I looked at my developed photos and felt almost grateful that this had occurred : Instead of mastering the tricks of lighting , I could now focus on the surface and texture of the rocks . <p> Here again I worked from transparencies . I was able to key in the subtlety and quiet transition of color that gave a sense of texture to the wall , which were quite different from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because I was painting such a close-up view , general shapes could be easily abstracted by the eye . I took advantage of this fact to really play with the watercolor . Rather than painting the grays and browns of the rocks , I chose to create neutrals by layering the complimentary colors of blue and orange . Not only did this add interest but it helped build a textured base that heightened interest in the rock . Before I added the color , though , I used a paper towel to dab on liquid mask in random areas . After a few washes , I removed the mask and continued layering in very light coats . <p> Whatever my subject matter , I just keep experimenting with the paint until I started to realize what works for me in each approach . One added benefit of diversifying your style is that you 're not expected to pursue a singular look or subject matter . Too often artists get locked into something because they do it so well and , consequently , when they want to go in a different direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to be shocked or disappointed by the disparity between my paintings but to expect it . I 'm reminded of a former employer who once told me that his company had trouble finding the right place for me because I did n't excel at one particular thing . Because I could do so many things , he said , I could serve the company best remaining where I was . This , obviously , was a double-edged compliment and , at the time , it denied me the chance to grow creatively . In the end , this experience only strengthened my determination not to give in to others ' expectations when it came to my art . <p> So , although it seems to be a contradiction in terms , my recommendation is to focus on creating diversity in your work . And when I refer to creating diversity in watercolor , I 'm really speaking of the ability to grow creatively , to experiment continually , to control and be controlled by a medium that allows you the freedom to be yourself . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23 .
