THE ETRUSCANS PRIZED IT AS HIGHly as gold . The Greeks mythologized it as the tears of Apollo 's daughters , solidified when they cried for their dead brother Phaeton . The Romans considered a single piece worth more than a slave . Cultures stretching from Central America to the Far East , from the Mediterranean to Scandinavia , have used it both as a powerful medicine and as a medium for exquisite jewelry and works of fine art . <P> Scientists , too , value amber . Trapped within the translucent , usually gold-colored substance are some of the most ancient examples of certain species known to science . The oldest ants , moths , stingless bees , caterpillars , termites , mushrooms and pollen grains , some of them dating back tens of millions of years , have been found in amber . And unlike ordinary fossils , which are relatively crude rock molds of prehistoric life forms , these specimens are often perfectly preserved , with the most delicate features intact . <P> Now entomologist David Grimaldi of New York City 's American Museum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most important of all amber fossils . " It 's three tiny flowers , probably from an oak tree , that date to the age of the dinosaurs , some 90 million years ago . That makes them the oldest intact flowers ever found in amber , and an important clue to the origin of the flowering plants that now dominate the earth . <P> Amber 's dual roles as artistic medium and scientific research tool have rarely intersected . But that 's just what they 'll do starting later this week . On Saturday the American Museum will unveil , under Grimaldi 's curatorial supervision , the most comprehensive display of amber ever mounted . The exhibition , " Amber : Window to the Past , " features 146 fossil specimens and 94 decorative objects from museums and private collections all over the world , including Stone Age amulets from Scandinavia , 18th and 19th century Chinese figurines and treasures once owned by the Medicis of Italy and the Czars of Russia . Many of these artworks have never been publicly shown ; none of them have ever been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being published by Abrams ( $49.50 ) . <P> Not bad for a substance that 's essentially dried-up tree resin . The viscous stuff that eventually turns into amber comes from a variety of ancient trees , mostly conifers , including pines and extinct relatives of sequoias and cedars , but also some deciduous trees . It probably evolved , says Grimaldi , as a defense against wood-boring insects . " As it dripped down the bark , " he explains , " it acted like flypaper and encapsulated them , hermetically sealing the trees ' wounds at the same time . " <P> Eventually the trees and their stalactites of dried resin fell , some of them ending up buried in soft sediments at the bottom of still and shallow bodies of water . There , over millions of years , the molecules of resin gradually amalgamated into long , durable chains , creating a material remarkably like plastic : airtight , watertight , chemically inert .
