<p> W.R. Ward looks at belief in eighteenth-century Europe and explores the tensions and creativity as the impulses of Reformation met the world of the Enlightenment . <p> Profoundly riven by competing confessional orthodoxies of Anglican , Lutheran , Calvinist and other reformed churches , each organised around an orthodox party , tied generally to states which differed endlessly in organisation and political interests , eighteenth-century Protestantism possessed in a deeper sense a common frame of mind . Deep-seated failures of understanding such as those created by new enterprises like American religion in the nineteenth century or African Christianity in the twentieth were still to come . In the early-eighteenth century there were still common perceptions of common problems , even shared disagreements on how to react to them which transcended the bounds of nation and denomination . <p> The common knowledge on which this rested was sustained partly by astonishing networks of correspondence which left a major mark on the history of the letter , partly by major movements of clergy which were in no way inhibited by attempts to preserve local livings for local boys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal itinerancy of particular trades , and partly by developments in the press which convinced readers that they were now more fully and rapidly informed about world events than any previous generation . Those events inevitably formed one of the preoccupations of the Protestant mind . <p> It has been calculated that adherents of Protestant confessions amounted to 40 per cent of the population of Europe in 1570 , but only 22 per cent of the ( doubtless smaller ) Europe of 1650 . By 1700 this disastrous legacy , so different from the context of progress in which Marxists and liberals have often viewed Protestantism , had been compounded by the social problems created by a long period of economic recession and by the unhappy experience of implementing the Westphalia settlement of 1648 that had ended the Thirty Years War between Catholic and Protestant Europe . It proved impossible to prevent Protestant churches being turned over to Catholic use in the wake of French aggression in the Palatinate ; within the Holy Roman Empire the attempt to return in confessional relations , to the normative year 1624 encountered the usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give ground as well . <p> Outside this Westphalia settlement , the enormous Protestant population in the triangle bounded by Salzburg , Transylvania and Poland was abandoned to the full heat of the Counter-Reformation with very little defence ; the re-emergence of a powerful Catholic party inside the Empire provided every inducement for Protestant princes to seek acceptance in the old fold . Scarcely a princely house remained unscathed . and the heads of major Protestant ruling families , as in Saxony and Wurttemberg , converted to Rome ; other Protestant lines , as in the Palatinate , died out and were succeeded by Catholic branches . <p> The fear and low morale which this debacle produced in the Protestant world lasted for much of the eighteenth century among professional diplomats as well as ordinary people . Even in the 1750s the German Reformed Church in America could appeal to international generosity on the ground that it was important to keep a secure asylum for the faith should Europe become untenable . In 1751 von Schauroth commenced his edition of the proceedings of the Corpus Evangelicorum in the Imperial Diet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time what conduces to its peace ' ; and in the Seven Years War , where the alliances of Protestant England and Prussia against Catholic Austria and France seemed assuredly to herald the long-dreaded confessional conflict , Howell Harris , the Welsh revivalist , acted out the role of minuscule Gustavus Adolphus , taking a party of volunteers to defend the English east coast against the French lest our privileges and liberties should be taken away from us ; especially the liberty of the gospel , which should the papists succeed we should be robbed of " , resolved to die in the field of battle in defence of the precious word of God , the Bible , against Popery ' . <p> The whole history of Protestant religious revival in the eighteenth century was deeply conditioned by the fact that confessional warfare seemed to reasonable men only temporarily deferred . Deferment gave time to organise ; long-nourished xenophobia , anti-Habsburg in Central Europe , anti-French in the West , in New England and Pennsylvania , anti-Spanish in Georgia , converted easily into nationalism in the more secular climate after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed to translate their generally harsh treatment of religious minorities into effective international confessional solidarity fall beyond a brief sketch of the Protestant frame of mind ; the consequences of fears that they would succeed do not . By the beginning of the eighteenth century men of faith had good grounds to conclude that for religious communities to rely upon the arm of the state in the shape of international legal guarantees was a mistake ; that something would have to be done for those in peril who had no guarantees , Protestants in the Habsburg lands , Waldensians in Savoy , 30,000 Swedes in exile in Siberia after Charles XII 's calamity in the battle of Pultava ( 1709 ) , Swiss and Germans swarming off , eventually by the hundred thousand , to America . <p> Reliance on religious establishment was . also a mistake . Too many princes took the heart out of the system by ratting to the Church of Rome ; too many Protestants were ill at ease with even non-Catholic rulers , Prussian Lutherans with their Reformed kings , Anglicans with Dutch Reformed and Hanoverian-Lutheran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defeat of Charles XII of Sweden . In any case , the highly articulated orthodoxies which had guaranteed church establishments intellectually seemed beyond the grasp of ordinary people , and were presented in a metaphysical framework becoming suspect to scholars . Everywhere the church courts provided abundant evidence of what was called practical atheism ; the establishment of the Reformation was not Christianising successive generations . Even the language of official churches was suspect . The North German Lutheran churches were abandoning the Platt-deutsch of the peasants for High German , the Church of England was thrusting English upon the Welsh , the Kirk doing likewise with Highland Gaelic-speakers. while for many Cassubians , Sorbs , W ends and other ethnic minorities there had never been much in the vernacular . <p> Where the godly prince had failed , private enterprise would have to succeed . New institutions , coupled with very active propaganda , appeared ; the famous charitable institutions at Halle , which were institutions of neither church nor state , for example , and the religious societies in England . All these were to work for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the principle of contractual organisation would be applied much more widely to religious activity , and already they incurred the wrath of those for whom the familiar structures of the church had acquired symbolic status or for whom the hierarchical aspects of the pastoral office was all-embracing . <p> There were , however , obstacles in the way of private enterprise besides the inevitable conservatism of the clergy and the ravages wrought on the flock by the inculcation of deference over the centuries . Philipp Spener ( 1635-1705 ) , the founder of the Pietist party in Lutheran Germany , had already advocated class meetings under clerical leadership , and even private gatherings in which the faithful should exercise the general spiritual priesthood by teaching , warning , converting and edifying each other . This programme , with its unmistakable implication that the parish round of devotions , the preaching and sacraments , were no longer enough , was violently denounced by the orthodox as opening the door to schism , and the more they raged the more self-fulfilling their prophecies were . It was also true that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radical alternative to the ponderous objectivities of seventeenth-century othodoxies , the philadelphian movements of which Quakerism was the most important , had been halted before the end of the century . What no one could foresee in 1700 was the degree to which the Quaker refuge in Pennsylvania , with its optimistically named capital , Philadelphia , would create an American dream in huge numbers of Scots-Irish , Germans and Swiss , and give power to the elbow of the very un-idealistic entrepreneurs who shipped them out . <p> If the conservative might thus regard private enterprise as hazardous or as having been tried and found wanting , it was also true that the state , if hardly the godly prince of the past , still had work for the churches to do ; not just in what Marc Raeff has called the well-ordered police state ' , but in constitutional Britain and republican Switzerland as well . The forces which constantly tempted Catholic princes to reform their churches without , or even against , the Pope operated everywhere as states sought for their own ends to get a grip upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight-forward assimilation ; the efforts of imperial Sweden to master its territories on the south side of the Baltic , in Lapland and Finland , the efforts of the United Kingdom to secure Scotland , Ireland or the American colonies , the attempts of Prussia to Germanise the Silesian Poles . <p> The work seemed to be basically religious in nature . The comprehensive ordinances of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries had commonly begun with rules relating to church attendance and the preservation of orthodoxy . However much the orthodox right come to fear the initiative of the state , they could hardly object to the regulation of morality , or the new measures ) against those forms of magic and superstition of which the state disapproved . In the long run states were bound to attempt rational methods of dealing with subjects whom the confessional orthodoxies could never deliver in their own image ; and even in the short run assimilation proved a great deal more difficult than any one expected . Habsburg efforts to assimilate their Protestant subjects evoked a crazy millenarianism in some , but religious revival in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth a revival which was Welsh and dissenting in character ; and in an unpublished sermon in New England Jonathan Edwards sounded the alarm against the allurements of the age of Walpole : <p> We are a country dependent on the English , we are such to their government , we have our books , and our learning from thence , and are upon many accounts exceedingly liable to be corrupted by them . This country is but a member of the body of which they are the head , and when the head is so sick , the members it is to be feared , will not long be in health . We are a branch of which they are the stock , and shall naturally derive , be assimilated , and likened to them . <p> This discomfort was curiously mirrored in the Church of Scotland . Supported by the firmest of all constitutional guarantees in the Act of Union , and engaged in a tremendous and finally successful struggle to assimilate the Highlands , the Kirk felt itself constantly threatened by English caesaro-papism , mores and culture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Walpole . <p> The well-ordered police state ' and its religious establishment had one substantial , if incomplete , triumph , for which it has never received the credit . The ancient faith of Livonia on the eastern side of the Baltic was a religion of nature and of fire , and it was sufficiently syncretistic to be able to absorb Catholicism and Protestantism in turn without giving much away . Perhaps nowhere was the Christian veneer so thin . When the Swedes acquired these territories , they not only greatly improved the church structure , and provided the basic texts of Protestant spirituality in the vernacular , but made a headlong assault upon an obstinately vigorous paganism . The whole policy was encapsulated in an ordinance of 1693 requiring peasants to <p> tear down the things which served or were dedicated to idolatry , crosses . groves . bushes . trees . stones and the like . to hew them down . to burn them with the sacrifices to purge and root them out in every possible way . so that not the least memorial may be left over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programme was still incomplete when the Swedes were turned out by Peter the Great , but the speed with which it was fulfilled in the late 1730s and early 1740s and the dramatic revivals which accompanied the offer of a live option by the Moravians , strongly suggest that the old order had received a body blow from the Swedes . <p> The episode in the Baltic had also a symptomatic importance . The Protestant world had formerly received its character from driving forces at the centre , from Saxony , Geneva , even Westminster . It was now increasingly affected by the determination of the powers not to leave the outer frontiers of that world alone . If Sweden had been attempting to extend the northeastern frontier of Protestantism , Poland , the Habsburgs and the Archbishop of Salzburg attempted to roll back the frontiers in the east , south-east and south ; if the United Kingdom attempted to enlarge the frontiers of Protestantism within the Union , and extend them in America , France would conspire against the one in alliance with the Jacobites , and against the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lusatia smuggled out Protestant settlers across the Bohemian border , the von Dietrichstein estates smuggled them in the opposite direction . The Spaniards in Florida similarly tried to promote the mass flight of slaves from Georgia . In many of these cases religious revival followed , a form of private enterprise on which no one had bargained , and events on the frontier enlarged the vision of hitherto blinkered state churches . To the Lutheran orthodox , America had been the outer darkness of the Gospel where the lost were cast with weeping and gnashing of teeth ; it came to be transformed in the orthodox journals into the area first reported under the new heading of the extension of the kingdom of God ' , and a place where the balance could be redressed against European nuisance . <p> This process of mind-stretching led to the discovery that well within the frontiers there were important ethnic minorities for whom little provision had been made , not to mention children of any ethnic origin . Moreover , to those who were most ready to face the challenge of doing the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the confessional division of Europe , so absolute in the eyes of the orthodox , was less absolute than it looked , and was being further diminished by the major movement of the literary culture of the day . One of the lessons of modern bibliographical studies ( which needed no teaching to contemporaries ) has been that the demand for devotional literature was overwhelming , and that it had never been possible to satisfy it from the Bible and Protestant sources alone . <p> The most popular work of all , which went through 632 editions in Latin and vernacular languages in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries , was a pre-Reformation text , The Imitation of Christ by Thomas a Kempis . Johann Arndt whose Four ( later Six ) Books of The Christianity are treated by theologians variously as the beating heart of Lutheran Orthodoxy and the spiritual fountain-head of Pietism , enjoyed almost an edition a year from the time he first appeared in 1605 up to the age of revivals 1740 . True Christianity appeared ninety-five times in German and twenty-eight in Latin , English , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian and Icelandic . The German editions probably amounted to 100,000 copies and were found everywhere ; it is reckoned of the persecuted Protestant peasants of Carinthia , that everyone who possessed three books or more had at least one volume of Arndt . Arndt made no bones about his dependence on Tauler , Kempis and other Catholic pre-Reformation writers , a dependence enlarged by modern inquiry to a broad spectrum of late medieval mysticism ' . <p> English Puritan literature enjoyed a much longer vogue on the Continent than it did at home . Most spectacularly Lewis Bayley 's Practice of Piety went through fifty-nine editions up to 1740 in English , and forty-five in German , French , Welsh , Hungarian , Romanian , Indian and Italian ; and Puritan devotional literature was in a great measure modelled on earlier Catholic literature . Modern Catholic writers who had fallen foul of church discipline were much favoured , especially Molinos , the Spanish priest and mystic condemned by the Inquisition in 1687 ; but Francois de Sales was also much read . The scale of the demand may be illustrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constituted 20 per cent of the total book production in Germany as compared with the 5 per cent devoted to belles lettres . <p> In short , while the polemical theologians raged against indifferentism , ordinary Protestants stayed themselves against a century of trial and terrible defeats by appealling to a spiritual tradition common to Catholic and Protestant . They had enough reason to be weary of the confessional division of Europe ; the men who ushered in new ways of Christianising their world went a step further and sought to mediate between the world of ecclesiastical precision and the world of spiritual nutriment . Philipp Spener and Isaac Watts , Richard Baxter and John Wesley all appeared as middle men of one kind or another . <p> The mention of English writers is a reminder that the official division of Protestant Europe between Lutheran and Calvinist Reformed was in this period further confused by the astonishing popularity of English literature of all kinds , and not least theological and devotional literature , in the Netherlands , Germany and Switzerland . Popularity in the Netherlands was in portent , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it did the dissemination of news . There had long been Englishmen who considered that English theology enjoyed more popularity in the Netherlands than was decent , Bishop Thomas Sprat complaining that : <p> our famous divines have been innumerable , as the Dutch men may witness , who , in some of their theological treatises , have been as bold with the English sermons as with our fishing ; and their robberies has been so manifest that our church ought to have reprizals against them , as well as our merchants . <p> It has been calculated that between 1600 and 1750 nearly 700 English religious works , mostly devotional in character were translated into German , and ran to about 1,700 editions and impressions . Bunyan was a hero in Protestant Germany within a decade of his death in 1688 , translated from English or Dutch versions , and was among the authors prescribed for reading in the Halle Orphan House on Sundays when there were no public prayers . English theology , devotional literature and sermons have never again enjoyed the esteem on the Continent which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even then their reputation benefited from two extraneous factors . The period from the middle of the seventeenth to that of the eighteenth century was a golden age in the history of moral philosophy , and one in which its concern for the study of the passions and their influence on behaviour ran very close to the interests of those , Catholic and Protestant , who were anxious to raise the level of religious devotion . And from the time when Hobbes had insisted on direct observation without preconceptions , British moralists had been important . <p> British literature also benefited from the political and social prestige which the country enjoyed in many ( though not all ) quarters . For Sigmund Jacob Baumgarten ( 1706-57 ) , an important theologian in the Lutheran transition to modernism , the task of applying historical criteria to theological studies involved creating a whole translation factory to put works of British history into German dress . The reason was that British liberty afforded <p> more notable examples of the most glorious virtues or most shameful vices , of the exceptional use and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most rapid and unexpected changes of good and ill fortune than other nations have to show , whose members have no such share in the supreme power . <p> This reputation for being larger than life served the English well with the advocates of the Enlightenment ; freedom of the press , it was thought , had made them a nation of singular boldness in Old Testament criticism and the philosophy of religion . <p> English influence was not , of course , the first to confuse the tidy lines of battle established by confessional polemics . By the time that influence became important not a little of the spiritual life of Europe had escaped confessional control . If at every social level there was a great deal of practical eclecticism between Christianity and non-Christian beliefs , and among spiritual writings of various confessional pedigrees , there was also an eclecticism amongst ancient ' truths , the pursuit of a core of mystical experience , the study of more than one alternative to the kind of science which so alarmed the orthodox . <p> The great name here was that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Upper Lusatia , a province which was to play an important role in the history of religious revival . Bohme did most of his work when it was clear that the independence of Upper Lusatia would fall to one or other of the orthodoxies competing early in the Thirty Years War , Catholic , Reformed or Lutheran . He offered an alternative science , alternative religion and alternative philosophy to the orthodoxies allied with the big battalions of the day . In 1624 Lusatia acknowledged the authority of the Elector of Saxony , and , his cause apparently lost , Bohme died as a man who had no more to live for . No one more completely mistook his situation , for he had given respectability to an anti-orthodox way of regarding things which thrived even in Spener 's circle and spread right across Europe into the Netherlands and Britain with as much organisation as an anti-institutional movement was ever likely to have . It took off to Pennsylvania , drew into itself the widespread interest in those modern Catholic mystics who had fallen foul of church authority , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the first professors at the new university of Halle , and the very embodiment of Christian humanism in the Germany of his day , as an antidote to Cartesianism . When interest in the logic of Wolff waned in the third quarter of the eighteenth century it had the vitality to return as the immediate background to Goethe and indeed to Kant . Wesley struggling with this as part of the heritage of William Law is a characteristic , not a lonely , figure . <p> Moreover the Behmenists have bequeathed a major problem to the modern historian . When the Lutheran orthodox Ehregott Daniel Colberg dedicated two fat volumes to refuting Platonisch-Hermetisches Christentum ( 1690 ) he found it necessary to devote successive chapters to Paracelsianism , Weigelianism and Rosicrucianism , to Quakers , Behmenists and Anabaptists , to the followers of Bourignon , Labadie and Molinos . That this was not just an example of the Orthodox persecution complex is suggested by the fact that Kelpius , who took the Hermetic outlook to Pennsylvania , could write that this late Revolution in Europe ( not to speak of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the name of Quietism , in the Protestant church under the name of Pietism , Chiliasm and Philadelphianism ' . This notion that the fundamental religious development was away from a clash of orthodoxies to a clash between the conservative and the progressive , less institutionalised forces of the age was very fully taken up in the revival movements when they established themselves , and explicitly stated by the Moravians , and by John Gillies of the evangelical party in the Kirk . <p> The grand schemes of historical understanding by which religious ( like secular ) movements interpret their age are , of course , always open to criticism in retrospect . The world picture created by the mystics and evangelicals has been no exception to this general rule Butler and his fellow revisionists in the United States now slighting it as interpretative fiction ' .

In the first moment , the new revolutionary government attempted to Islamize higher education . The second phase commenced at the close of the Iran-Iraq war ( 1980-1988 ) and the liberalization of the economy . The third phase , the 1997 election of President Seyyed Mohammad Khatami , was marked by political liberalization . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conservative candidate , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , stimulated a third moment , marked by the politics of nuclear and bio-sciences and new set of interactions among a range of different discourses ( e.g. , national narratives , and the Shari'a ) interact in the post-revolutionary context . Most members of the Iranian scientific community perceive this new era as a setback to social reform . In this article , I show the heterogeneity of both Islamic discourses and scientific practices in a new context that I call a new assemblage for the production of scientific knowledge . <p> Keywords : Iran ; Science ; Religion ; Education ; State ; Islam ; Globalization <p> " ... Global forms interact with other elements , occupying a common field in contingent , uneasy , unstable interrelationships . The product of these interactions might be called the actual global , or the global in the space of assemblage . In relationship to " the global , " the assemblage is not a " locality " to which broader forces are counterposed ... An assemblage is the product of multiple determinations that are not reducible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is emergent . " ( Ong and Collier 2005:12 ) <p> L : Introduction Shortly after the Iranian revolution of 1979 , the government formed a commission to reform the secular structure of universities and educational institutions . There is a history to this move ; in fact it is a reformation of an earlier reform . These modern institutions of higher learning in Iran date to the early nineteen hundreds , when a new constitutional movement led to a series of social reforms in the context of modernizing the structure of education . These changes would replace the existing indigenous schools in which Islam played a central role . These social reforms culminated in the emergence of new social classes and a new era of secularization that rendered Islam irrelevant in the production of knowledge and education . As I wrote in an earlier article , <p> " The period of transition , from the turn of the century to the emergence of the secular state in the 1920s , was rich with activities of cultural translation , creating a new culture of curiosity . The discursive formation of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the modern secular state with its discourses of ' governmentality ' and other ' autonomous ' processes . Crafted cultural translations ... had ceased by the time of the emergence of modern secular states . The translations that generated lively debates came to an end around the 1920s , when secular states adopted a hegemonic view of science as universal , and value- and culture-free . Consequently , Islam and other local cultural traditions were increasingly rendered irrelevant . " ( Lotfalian 2001:235 ) <p> It is important to historicize the contemporary resurgence of Islam and its relevance to knowledge production . From the last days of the Ottoman Empire , in the early 20th century , to the Iranian revolution , the role of Islam and its place vis -- vis knowledge changed . Describing these changes elsewhere ( Lotfalian 2004 ) , I defined Islamization as a series of processes through which interpreters of Islam interact with existing discourses and institutions of societies and call for change in their makeup . Here I focus on the post-revolution Iran . <p> Reforms in the early part of the last century in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its center , but the contemporary era is marked by globalization and Islamization . The universal claimed by the secular movement is now encountering other universals , in this case Islam . As Anna Tsing ( Tsing 2005 ) argues , these competing conceptions of the universal create friction in the contemporary world . <p> What , specifically , are these frictions ? Are there single or multiple causes for them ? How can ethnography delineate some of these questions ? Scholars , especially in area studies , have elaborated on the emergence of Islamism , its relation to the secular state , and its historical roots ( Gle 1990 , 1993a , 1993b , 1995 ; Kepel and Richard 1990 ; Richard 1991 ; Roy 1990 ) . What has been less elaborated is an account of the activities and dynamics about different discourses and their situatedness in the larger context . This is the kind of project that anthropologists , sociologists , and students of science studies are taking up . I propose to explore here the changes in the Iranian community of scientists in the aftermath of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interacted with different Islamization efforts . <p> In this paper , I outline the post-revolutionary shifting of discourses and people in the Iranian scientific community . The initial failure of earlier Islamization attempts is a part of these shifts . I argue that this community 's experience has moved from the earlier Islamization of institutions as an ideological top-down programmatic to a more heterogeneous process . <p> A comparative perspective on the Iranian experience is instructive , since the relationship between Islam and science has followed different trajectories in other parts of the world . For example , in Malaysia the global movement of the Islamization of knowledge was more influential than in Iran . In my previous work ( Lotfalian 2004 ) , I offered a pragmatic perspective that traces dialogues and intersections rather than privileging a particular discourse . The main argument was that the contemporary question concerns Islam , and science is about emergent forms and norms rather than opposing principles and discourses . <p> So it is important to know that the post-revolutionary experience of the Iranian scientific community started with a discourse about the Islamization of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Islamization from above , with the aim of diminishing the differences between religious seminaries ( hoze ) and universities ( daneshgah ) in terms of both the frame and content of education . A global movement of Islamization of knowledge in the 1980s and 1990s largely relied on the neo-liberal economy , but the Iranian experience was instead affected primarily by the revolution of 1979 , when the oil industry , nuclear industry , and educational institutions all came under government control . <p> Moreover , there are Islamic actors and networks of scientific institution building in Iran beyond the government program of Islamization . The global Islamic movement to change the outlook of knowledge has sympathizers ; the Sufi philosophical critique of science has some authoritative following ; educational institutions that focus on Islamic ethos and sensibilities , such as Qom 's Mofid University , are influential ; and individual ayatollah 's fatwas , commentaries and books on science and medicine have their own social affect . For instance , ayatollahs ' commentaries on matters of applications of science such as in organ transplantation and fertility are taken seriously and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a form of permission ( ijaza ) . <p> One of the methodological questions anthropologists might ask when trying to understand changes after the Iranian revolution is : Where to look ? Islam became the ultimate arbiter of everything social . How do ayatollahs ' commentaries on science , or conferences that are organized by various governmental agencies , such as the Iranian Academy of Sciences , or activities of religious groups and individuals on university campuses , or the networks of practicing scientists in various fields , influence the reconstruction of science in Iran ? <p> At the center of the struggle to reconstruct science in Iran , the government has criticized secular programs in universities ( the modern Iranian universities established during the intense secularization of the early 20th century ) . The government followed this critique with action , purging many faculties from the fields of the sciences , the social sciences , and the humanities . But if anthropologists looked into these types of politics they might not go very far with their conclusions , for they will inevitably take these politics to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , I argue that they can only be understood in the context of a revolutionary society where various discourses , technologies , and people generate friction . <p> Two recent studies ( Khosrokhavar et al . 2004 , Schayegh 2004 ) , for instance , illustrate that the development of science and technology in Iran did not emanate only from the state 's top-down planning but emerged over the last century from a complicated network of people , things , and programs . Schayegh points to the relationship between middle-class development and hygienic discourses . Khosrokhavar et al . ' s interviews with a large number of scientists reveal nuances among different fields of science . They conclude that biological sciences have become self-sufficient and self-reproducing regardless of government planning . <p> I propose that the case of the Iranian scientific community is an instance of a distinctively anthropological concern . The nature of social scientific understanding has also changed in order to grapple with understanding the frictions resulting from heterogeneous processes of knowledge production and various universals at work . Fischer ( Fischer 2003 ) suggests that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cultural explanations , but in the 1980s anthropologists began working in a space ( a third space ) where they began to locate their role among many terrains of situated perspectives and moral systems . He calls these terrains ethical plateaus . Fischer points to a lack of a unifying logos of knowledge , and Rabinow ( 2005 ) suggests that this lack should not lead to chaos but a productive understanding of anthropology 's own position . Rabinow also suggests that anthropology 's role is to generate critical perspectives in the midst of relations among various plains of knowledge systems . He calls this anthropology 's problem . <p> In following Iranian scientists and their interactions with Islamization and governmental interventions , it becomes clear that , while reactions are varied , they all point to heterogeneous processes which construct the technoscientific world . We can read this heterogeneity in a variety of symptoms or sites : when Islamization and counter Islamization or non-Islamic discourses interact in the context of institution building , in the production of books , and in traces of scientists ' life experiences . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In what follows , I describe the " actual global " of the post-revolution Iranian scientific community 's experiences : how institutions , discourses , and people interact and shift , and how this actual is not an objective reality , as some scientists claim , but rather an actual that is grounded in various sources of knowledge , such as Islamic history of science , contemporary Islamic resurgence , and Western sciences . That is , this actual is emergent within the assemblage of knowledge production . I show this actual global of scientific community through looking at three windows to scientists ' experiences . The first window is their history , particularly how they have interacted with institutional and political changes over the past 25 years . Second , scientists themselves reflected on these changes in their publications . Third , I explore the connection between Iran and its diaspora . As Charles Kurzman has cautioned for work on Iran , n1 it is important to use a concept of Islamic network that does not reify the network or view it in isolation from its dynamic social-cultural context . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Actors and Networks The government 's initial attempts at Islamization in post-revolution Iran were mostly philosophical at best and political purges at worst . It targeted the universities in particular , because they remained social spaces in which scholars tried to resist the government 's authoritarian policies . Scientists tried to find different venues to continue their research . ( For example , in 1991 , Dr. Sobouti established the Institute for Advance Studies in Basic Sciences in Zanjan , n2 far from the capital . ) They were able to do so because old guard scientists ( i.e. , those who received their education long before the revolution and had already established themselves internationally ) , drawing on a combination of entrepreneurial , governmental , and technical resources , navigated through the existing diverse discourses and interests about science and advocated for institutions of " excellence " that would be mostly independent of Tehran 's politics . They had leverage because , in the aftermath of Iran-Iraq war , the government demanded technical manpower and sought to develop indigenous technical prowess in the context of various international sanctions . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reform secular institutions of education , it is imperative to consider the already existing community and networks of scientists . <p> Although traveling was difficult in the 1980s and during the Iran-Iraq war , Iranian scientists maintained ties with the international community . Indeed , post-revolution Iran had large numbers of scientists who were educated in Europe and the US . Some of my informants noted that 80% of PhD holders in the government had received their degrees in the US . <p> Many scientists argue that during this period the technical universities declined in rigor and quality . Nonetheless , they did continue to produce good scientists . The establishment of PhD programs raised the quality of some programs , but not all universities have PhD programs . One institution , Sharif University , remains well respected , with its students continuing to win in international Olympiads of science . Many Sharif University graduates can be found throughout the United States , and their reunions held in the US attract large participation from Iranian scientists in the US as well as in Iran and elsewhere . <p> Other post-revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended as a distant learning university ) and Free Islamic University , also appear to have a positive impact on Iranian society . My observations and interviews suggest at least two areas in which they have changed education . First , they have spread university level education to the farthest reaches of Iran , thus making education increasingly accessible to non-elites . And second , the universities have created a new workforce that is mobile and disciplined , not unlike that of any other modern society . However , critics argue that these new universities have lowered the quality of education because they have compromised quality for quantity . <p> The question of quality of education in the contemporary Islamic world , of course , translates into debates over the degree to which Islam is a player and to what extent secular education is relevant . The government 's initial project to Islamize the universities from the top down gave way in the early eighties to the creation of more decentralized institutions , in which the government played a minimal role , such as the Free Islamic University and Mofid University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an elite modern Islamic university . To illustrate the competing discourses in ( and the range of ) higher education , one can juxtapose the Free Islamic University and Mofid University to the Institute for Advanced Studies in Basic Sciences in Zanjan , which has a Western and secular outlook . <p> The result of this gradual change from the centralized planning of education of the 1980s to competing institutional discourses of the 1990s , was two-fold , and contradictory . On the one hand , centers of power multiplied and it became more difficult to change institutions uniformly . On the other hand , from an economic point of view , the government became the main actor in the private sector . <p> The multiplied centers of power and the entrepreneurial activities among the actors kept shifting the physical locations and institutional affiliations of individual scientists and politicians . It is instructive to map out some of these movements as ethnographic examples of changes in the politics of scientific institution building . <p> The movement of scientists from one institution to another was particularly volatile in the early days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's reorganization of science and technology after the revolution , and their movement played an important part in institution building . For instance , Reza Mansouri , a physicist who taught at Sharif University , built bridges with other institutions , one of which was the Institute of Religion and Philosophy ( hekmat va falsafeh ) , initially proposed by Hossein Nasr ( the renown Iranian-American Sufi scholar ) and still highly regarded . This institution was actually created before the revolution , and thus embodies the continuity of the pre-revolutionary institutions and their importance in the new era . Mansouri moved up and across many levels of governmental agencies , ending up as a director in the Ministry of Higher Education . In his endeavors , he sympathized with Islam as a cultural movement and a national identity rather than as a program for Islamizing institutions . His movements resulted in institutional crossbreeding , and thus deepened debates over science and technology . <p> The revolution had a great impact on the scientific community . It broke many links and established new ones . Instead of reifying the notion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one understands its multiplicity and dynamics . I will do this by attending to actors ' writings as both their cultural capital and rhetorical strategies . <p> 2 ) By Way of Writing : Debating Histories I interviewed physicists who in the early days of the revolution helped organize scientific institutions ; they all expressed bewilderment over the deep changes in post-revolution society . Unfortunately , only a few of them published historical or autobiographical accounts on the history and development of science in Iran . In these chronicles , however , we can read the traces of their dialogue over the Islamization of institutions in the aftermath of the revolution . <p> Several scientists were active in the government committee organized to recast higher education in terms of Islam . One key player on the Islamization side was Abdolkarim Soroush , who holds a degree in the history of science from England and is now an outspoken reformer who argues against Islamization . Others , outside the committee , were included as well . Physicist Mehdi Golshani , of Sharif University , a supporter of Islamization , though not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between religion and science . He is a graduate of UC Berkeley and was influenced by Islam in America in the 1970s , specifically the views of the global movement of Islam represented by Ismail al-Faruqi . <p> There are other actors who responded critically to Islamization . For this study I am particularly interested in Sahpour Etemad , a philosopher of science ( with a PhD in the philosophy of cybernetics ) and Reza Mansouri , a physicist . Both graduated from European universities and as they began their careers as professors , they engaged in debates over the reorganization of science in Iran , which eventually led them to the ministry of research and higher education . Both moved to new institutions as politics changed and networks shifted , and both have left interesting traces in their trajectories that speak to the shifting social organization of science . <p> Etemad 's work is concerned less with the cultural aspects of science and more with the history and philosophy of science as it developed in the West , and how Western science can be adopted in Iran . His two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of science . In The Structure of Science and Technology in Iran ( 1999 ) , he applies statistical analysis as a method of measurement , and in The World and Cognitive Revolution and Cognitive Sciences ( 2002 ) he analyzes the development of science in the West through historical and philosophical changes that began during the Enlightenment . <p> In his third book , Mainstream Research in Iran 1970-2003 ( 2004 ) , Etemad creates a sophisticated map of science in Iran and compares this to the global world of science . His use of scientometrics , a scientific method of measuring science , and statistics are noteworthy , because this combination of approaches interrupted the mainly ideological nature of earlier post revolutionary debates . For example , his use of quantitative data to demonstrate the social construction of scientific facts was instrumental in why scientific production declined in Iran after the revolution and why the application of internationally recognized standards in Iranian scientific publications could be one method out of this gridlock . <p> Mansouri was a colleague of Etemad 's at the National Research Institute for Science Policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's appointment as a director at the National Research Ministry in 2001 was instrumental in bringing Etemad in to run the science policy center of the ministry . I will , first , give a biograpohical sketch of Mansouri because I think his life and work speak to the overarching argument of this paper that the early ideological effort of Islamization gave way to a heterogeneous landscape of practice for building or rebuilding scientific community . <p> He received his PhD in physics in Austria and returned to Iran in the early 1980s , where his activities included teaching at Sharif University , serving on ministry boards , and writing books on science and education . In my interviews with him he spoke about his early interest in how language shapes the culture of sciences . Indeed , he successfully argued for the establishment of a body to generate a Persian scientific vocabulary . <p> Mansouri conceived his National Will for Cultural and Scientific Development : Iran 2048 ( 1998 ) just as the initial Islamization of universities was losing ground . Despite economic sanctions on Iran , during Akbar Hasehmi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of relative prosperity ; the Islamic government no longer lived in a state of emergency as it had during the war . When President Mohammad Khatami then came to power in 1997 , the country , especially the intelligentsia , felt positively about the potential for change and held out hope that Iran could be both Islamic and democratic . The election of Khatami permitted intellectuals to imagine their history and their role differently . Mansouri uses historical documents to suggest that a national character for science in Iran is more appropriate than a religious one . <p> His Astronomy for Everyone ( 1999 ) focuses on his area of scientific expertise and reflects his long-standing anthropological interest in how people learn and practice science . It is a book written for a general audience and appeals to widespread popular interest in astronomy in Iran . The Persian title ( falak ra saghf beshkafim va tar-hi no dar-andazim ) is a play on a quote from Hafez , the 14th century mystic poet : " we open the skies and invent new plans . " The book was broadcast during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success of his effort to use both national and religious traditions to talk about science . <p> He wrote his most recent book , What Should I Do with Iran ? Improvement and Chaos in Scientific Development ( 2005 ) , during a setback in social reform . Ahmadinejad came to power in 2005 and began purging from the universities those intellectuals he labeled " secular . " This labeling resonates with earlier post-revolution attempts at Islamization , as if two decades of reforms had not taken place . Responding to these changes , Mansouri addresses the social aspects of science , drawing on science studies language more than before and includes an implied argument with Islamists . There is an emphatic sense of frustration and tension with possibility of positive change . <p> I found the performativity of these books important in identifying a dynamic interpretive frame for the transformation of scientific settings in the post-revolution Iran . At the outset of the revolution , there existed no historically and culturally grounded account of science and technology in Iran . Yet , ironically , early Islamization attempts set the stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Etemad rushed to write about elements of the technoscientific assemblage , those emergent processes that create the world of science , and that the Islamization program left out . They expressed these ideas by writing about the relationship between culture and science . As Mansouri 's books show , he takes " social realism " as a framing device to argue against the failure of the early Islamization . Etemad 's writing has an even stronger positivistic tone . Although the content of his writing focused on how Iran has fallen behind in the realm of science at the international level , the form was a scientific realism achieved by numbers and graphs . Indeed , his recommendations ( echoing many other actors ) were effective . In recent years Iran has caught up ( as it can be verified in the SCI : Scientific Citation Index ) and moved ahead of some Middle Eastern countries. ( n3 ) <p> These performative instances of publication on scientific development allow us to trace not only the heterogeneity of discourses and debates on this process but also allow us to look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explore yet another important element . <p> 3 ) By Way of Community 's Other : Iran and its Technical Diaspora " Diaspora , " in modern Iranian history , refers to the population of Iranians who left Iran just before and during the revolution and remained outside the country afterwards . Iranian universities became increasingly Americanized after World War II , reflecting a desire to imitate Western ( especially American ) forms in the hopes that such imitation would lead to development and progress . This desire was translated into the politics of the US/Iran relationship , as Iran and the US became close allies . This meant that many Iranians would get their education in the US . Initially , most members of the diaspora were students whose families had dispatched them to the US or Europe for a university education . Many members of this group who became scientists and engineers remained outside Iran after the revolution . Thus the politics of diaspora was born . In this section , I discuss this important and unexplored relationship and history , by distinguishing between the technical diaspora ( scientists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others in health and medical sciences ) . <p> In the early days of the revolution , Iran 's Islamic Republic was preoccupied with political instability and , above all , the war with Iraq . Iran was thus not a suitable place for many to return to . In fact , the government closed the universities for a while , which added to the desire of the diasporic population to consolidate itself in Western countries , especially the US . The number of Iranian scientists and engineers in the US alone is significant . I have conducted research with scientists and engineers in Cambridge ( at Harvard and MIT ) , Houston , Berkeley , and in New York City ; and I am now beginning to conduct research in the Silicon Valley , where the concentration of Iranians engineers is highly visible , garnering press coverage and generating a self-image of significance just lagging behind Indian and Chinese ethnic groups . <p> The prominence of this community in the US has made them good candidates for leadership in the larger diasporic community in the US as well as potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diasporic Iranians with financial capital were not active philanthropists . Recently , however , some scientists and engineers who have made financial gains in the US , especially during the dot.com bubble , and began to contribute to the Iranian-American community . For example , the new Persian Studies Center at University of California Irvine was made possible by a contribution from an Iranian computer scientist and a venture capitalist , Dr. Fariborz Maseeh , who made his fortune in software design during the dot.com boom of the late 1990s . <p> Aside from the fact that this is an interesting turning point in " philanthropic " work for Iranians , n4 the gift is symbolically significant . The center is the first of its kind anywhere in the world , and has been named the Dr. Samuel Jordan Center after the person who created Alborz High School in Tehran in the early part of 20th century , a school that has given many scientists and engineers to the world . Dr. Jordan was an American , one of many Presbyterian missionaries in Iran . I am a graduate of Alborz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educational genealogy of many professional Iranians in the diaspora . Alhough other top schools have also produced world class scientists and engineers , Alborz held symbolic value in being both American and Iranian in its conception . In the 70s , many Alborz graduates studied in the US , especially in California . <p> Precisely because of these American links , the revolutionaries had an ambivalent relationship with Alborz . Just as with cinema , they saw it a Western construct and denounced it , only to appropriate it later not only for propaganda but as a form of art . But its graduates were everywhere by then , even in the ranks of the revolutionaries . They were in government after the revolution as well , which has also maintained an ambivalent relationship with the school . <p> The formation of the technical and medical diaspora is tied to history of institutions at home and in the US . Many Alborz graduates have also ended up at Sharif University ( prior to the revolution it was called Aryamehr ) . The formation of the Smauel Jordan Center could be read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ties . This parallel kinship between institutions and network of scientists pours over the national boundary and it is important in understanding both contemporary Iran and its diaspora . <p> The Iranian medical diaspora has a similar genealogy , connected both to the West and Iran through institution and history . The community of the Iranian medical diaspora is older than that of the scientists and engineers in the technical diaspora . As a result of the US/Iran cooperation prior to the revolution , the government set up the medical profession in order to produce high quality doctors . Medical doctors would travel between Iranian and the US medical communities in the 1960s and the 1970s . As a result of such institutional relationships , members of this generation had a smoother transition than other professionals to a diasporic existence and started moving into prominent positions in the US medical profession , starting before the revolution . The exigencies of the post revolutionary era changed both the quality of the profession and the connection with the West . In the new era , Iran has produced more doctors but fewer specialists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in order to cater to the general medical needs of a booming population . <p> Both the technical and the medical diaspora and their relationship to Iran have been understudied . They constitute an Iranian scientific community outside Iran . In an earlier study , for instance , I showed that the medical community creates itself largely in connection to the poetry and history of Iran ( Lotfalian 1994 ) . And they are visible , among other times , in their responses to natural disasters . During various earthquakes in Iran , the technical diaspora has organized charity and technical help whereas the medical community has mobilized several medical care missions to the disaster areas . <p> The connection between the Iranian scientific community and its diaspora has been an evolving process , at times one step forward , two steps back . In the early 90s , the Iranian government attempted to connect with its diasporic populations . President Rafsanjani conceived this connection as an economic one , as well as a means to tap into the national narrative to attract scientists and engineers back to the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have sketched above , are the backbone of this evolving link . For example , they make numerous connections at such networking nodes , such as conferences both inside and outside Iran . They also foster exchanges and collaborations in particular areas of work , and these can lead to new insights : for instance , the collaboration between diasporic and Iranian scientists on the topic of fuzzy logic led to the publication of a large number of papers in Iran on this subject . <p> Other factors shaping the relationship between the government and the diaspora include institution building and international politics . There is ongoing debate about what effect , if any , sanctions on Iran have had . The effect on the scientific community in particular is difficult to assess . In the area of Iranian nuclear development , the US used the Khan case ( in which a Pakistani physicist was found guilty of leaking nuclear technology to Iran ) , both to scrutinize the network of scientists as well as to argue for sanctions against Iran . In spite of these international constraints , Iran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties continue to invest in Iran 's scientific and technological developments despite the sanctions . I have talked to many scientists in Iran and one thing they do n't complain about is the lack of money ! For instance , due to the sanctions , Iran has trouble buying equipment , but scientists usually resolve this by paying more and buying them from Dubai . Moreover , in many labs that I visited , inventive scientists produced their own equipment . <p> But the sanctions are more than economic : the US monitors the movement of Iranian scientists and of scholarship itself . For instance , in 2004 the US Congress forbade the translation of scientific material into and from Persian . And in August 2006 , the US deported three dozens Iranian scientists from a Sharif University alumni reunion in Silicon Valley . Though a US embassy had granted them visas , in the atmosphere of heightened terrorist alerts and increasing tensions over Iran 's nuclear program , an official at a checkpoint revoked them . <p> At the outset of the revolution , Iranians used the catch phrase " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iranian scientific community and its diaspora . This relationship improved over time . In particular , members of the technological diaspora and medical diaspora have taken great interest in the future of Iran ; the Iranian government has not only allowed but encouraged this interest . Although the US government has interrupted some communications , there is a sense that " brain drain " is giving way to " brain circulation . " <p> Thus far , I have described the actual global of the post-revolution Iranian scientific community that functions as assemblages of multiple determination . I have talked about how networks and institutions shift with political economy and to what extent they do not follow a single logic . I have also talked about international politics and the politics of diaspora as they follow various logics and they shift . All of these elements form assemblages . For the rest of the paper I will argue for new emerging assemblages and why scholars and scientists alike should rethink the role of Islam in Iranian science . <p> L : New Assemblages In juxtaposing the early Islamization of the 1980s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it becomes apparent that new assemblages have emerged and been added to those of the earlier period . During the war with Iraq , and the various sanctions the West imposed at that time , the government invested in its military/industrial complex . The army and the Passdaran ( an elite militia , independent of the army ) also invested in non-governmental industry , which included science . For instance , one of the prestigious hospitals belongs to the Passdaran because of its interest in genetics ; in other words , one arm of a notoriously Islamist apparatus is trying to become a competitive scientific research institution . <p> These new assemblages frame the ways in which the government defines politics and sociality . Here I offer two examples from the current emergences : the first concerns the Internet and the discourse of national security ; the second , the nuclear industry and Iran 's " right " to possess nuclear capability . These two cases show a new era of globalization that complicates Iranian projects of Islam and science . This era has put a moratorium on 1980s discourses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the scientific community . <p> 1 ) The Internet and Filtering As the Internet has become an important tool for helping Iran enter into the world of the information society , the government has used new devices for regulating it . In particular , it has invested in filtering software packages to regulate citizens ' access to the world outside of Iran . Filtering ( Persian , adopted directly from the English word " filtering " ) allows such control by restricting access to certain keywords . If a filter detected the word " sex " in a search or on a site , for example , it would deny a user access . The search will be redirected to a page that says " access denied . " As the Internet has a complicated and vast structure , such control is very hard to achieve . Nevertheless , through this tool , citizens are disciplined in a new way to understand a particular view of their rights and responsibilities , of what is permissible and what is not . Out of a technological application , then , a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public than by a network system and more abstract control . <p> There is a parallel example in satellite TV . The Iranian government once controlled what people watched by conducting door to door searches for receivers . A few years ago , the government became increasingly faceless and hands-off , focusing instead on the signals . Moreover , the government developed strong magnetic field disturbances to counteract satellite transmissions . Now , when the government does not want citizens to watch satellite TV programs ( Voice of America , for example ) , it effectively jams the particular signals . During the winter of 2007 , Ahmadinejad 's government returned to the hands-on strategy , cracking down on satellite dishes -- but they managed to do so without entering individual houses simply by looking for dishes installed on the roofs of large housing complexes . <p> Filtering and jamming broadcasts denotes a shift in discourses of risk taking and governmentality . By the end of the 1980s , that is , Iran was moving towards a reliance on non-governmental agencies as well as the private sector in the economy . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lupton suggests in her reading of " risk society : " <p> " The strategies of governmentality , expressed in the neo-liberal states that emerged in the West in late modernity , include both direct , coercive strategies to regulate populations , but also , and most importantly , less direct strategies that rely on individuals ' voluntary compliance with the interests and needs of the state . These strategies are diverse and multi-centered , emerging not only from the states but also other agencies and institutions , such as the mass media ... Citizens are positioned in governmental discourses , therefore , as active rather than passive subjects of governance . " <p> In short , the introduction of filtering has helped launch a discourse of risk in Iran . Now the government considers national security in a discourse of risk , and as something that should be managed and averted . <p> 2 ) Nuclear Assemblages In recent years , Iran 's nuclear development has loomed larger on the global and national stage . The coming to power of President Ahmadinejad signaled a particular turn . Ahmadinejad used pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time using global media coverage of the " Iranian threat " to boost his popularity around the world and consolidate his power in Iran . At the end of the cold war , these types of media cat-and-mouse games have become modes of international political struggle . Iranian citizens often defend the right to have nuclear industry without necessarily supporting their government 's saber rattling . There is a sense that the government invokes national pride as an organizing element for public persuasion . Meanwhile , Islam enters into discussions of nuclear issues only when Ayatollah Khamenei declares in public speeches that Islam does not believe in using nuclear bomb . <p> Of course the other side of the issue is the US threat to bomb Iranian nuclear sites . International opinion is divided , with Russia and China pursuing different regional interests than Europe and the US . The US may temporarily convince the international community to demand that Iran stop uranium enrichment , but it seems that Europe has too much of a vested interest in Iran to continue to back the US . <p> Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Iranian nuclear industry . The article 's main argument is that Iran is definitely moving towards having the nuclear bomb , and the only question is when . It becomes clear that the rest of the world is increasingly seeing Iran as a threat and danger and that even the Iranian government has appropriated this fear for its own political ends . <p> The construction of nuclear Iran occurs between various narratives : Islam , nation , and Iran 's international interest -- with Islam being the least pronounced aspect of this construction . These are evolving and now , after the Israeli/Hezbollah war on the one hand and the US invasion of Iraq , on the other , we can talk about Iran 's ambition as a regional power . <p> L : Re-assemblage of Institutions and Technologies After the Iranian Revolution In Global Assemblages , Ong and Collierv suggest three kinds of institutional reflexive practices that go through an ongoing change based on new technological input and are associated with new forms of socio-political transformation . First , they specify practices that can be called technological : these are projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology , legal , and economic discourses that would fit contemporary uncertain environments , as in the case of choosing an appropriate medium for a political campaign . Second , they note those practices that can be called political : they have to do with specific political processes that actors might redirect by rethinking certain juridico-political categories in terms of their public ramifications , such as in the categories of " work " or " biological citizenship . " The third is the realm of ethical reflection : these are practices that concern value and morality , as in the case of organ transplantation . <p> As an extension of the ethical reflection , I would like to add a fourth reflective practice : cultural and religious reflection : such reflections become the bases for emergent modes of modernization and the reconstruction of new societies that politicians and professionals adopt . I am suggesting that this fourth addition is essential and was previously lacking in the concept of assemblages . New ethnographic works ( Hamdy 2005 , Hirschkind 2006 , Lotfalian 2004 , Mahmmood 2005 , Maurer 2006 , Sanal 2005 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes necessary and plays out in various forms of cultural metaphors and rhetoric : expressive modes of patients , for example , or new competing universals from cleric 's revelatory references to sacred texts and ulama ( religious scholars ) deliberating on new medical procedures . <p> In the light of this fourth frame , do we need to reconceptualize what it means to talk about the social in the construction of science or what we might call reconstructive projects. n6 In this article , I have talked about the case of Iran by looking back and interpreting some of the events that shaped science in Iran , focusing on the period that started at the beginning of the revolution . I have argued that the earlier attempts to Islamize the institutions of higher learning gradually moved towards competing discourses of reform and institutional politics . Specifically , the notion of " risk " became an organizing element in emerging discourses of national security and international relations , as exemplified in the cases of the Internet and nuclear technology . Finally , I suggested that the re-assemblage of technoscience include religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Would it help us understand the situation of technoscience in Iran if we considered how other parts of the Islamic world , for instance Malaysia , rely on hybrid forms and norms ? Would a comparative perspective on relationship between Islamizaton and science help us understand the reassemblage of technoscience in the Islamic world ? The condition of possibility of institution building , the emergence of authorial voices , and the politics of technical diaspora -- all these have shifted from one set of social , economic , and political measures and rationalities to another . I think the new assemblage has resurrected some old ideas of development , such as progress and modernization that were under attack immediately after the revolution . With it , those who are engaged in reconstruction projects need to reconfigure and understand the place of Islam in new assemblages of knowledge production . <p> L : ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I would like to thank Michael Fischer , Jon Anderson , and Gregory Starrett for their critical commentaries at the AAA meetings 2006 . I would also like to thank my colleague Chris Furlow for his constructive feedback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and editorial comments of my friend Laura Helper-Ferris , I can not thank her enough . <p> L : Footnotes n1 Kurzman discusses the following point concerning the use of network metaphor in the Islamic context : 1 ) networks break down and must be built and rebuilt . 2 ) the goals may not be transferable from one network to another , it may be necessary to build a counternetwork. 3 ) the idea of network should not be reified . The process is more important . For example , khomeini , was able to mobilize network without controlling the nodes and structure , but from outside of it he was able to appropriate it . <p> n2 In my visit to Zanjan in the winter of 2007 , I talked to scientists , students , and administrators . This is one of the centers of excellence in Iran . Iran now has a few centers of excellence . These centers function , to some extent , autonomously of the government . Moreover , the quality of students and faculty members is high and this has led to an increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circulation of these elite scientists both abroad and inside Iran . <p> n3 Scientific publication decreased after the revolution , especially during the Iran and Iraq war . In the late 80s , during Rafsanjani 's presidency publications began increasing . The rate of increase by 2006 was 26% . The number of publications by 1999 was 4600 ( during Khatami 's presidency ) a increase from 1200 by 1990 . Medical sciences hold 25% of all publications in science with neurobiology holding the highest number in the medical sciences . <p> n4 The philanthropic work in Iranian community is expanding . There are two noteworthy additions in 2007 : First , Stanford University opened a center for Iranian studies with a large donation by another Iranian-American businessman . Also , Pierre Omidyar , the founder of eBay has recently created a philanthropic organization to teach Iranians how to do community organization based on a model that he created and expanded at eBay . <p> n5 " Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari Use the term " assemblage " to denote a contingent ensemble of diverse practices and things that is divided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular alignments of technical and administrative practices extract and give intelligibility to new spaces by decoding and encoding milieus . In short , particular assemblages of technology and politics not only create their own spaces , but also give diverse values to the practices and actors thus connected to each other . Deleuze and Guattari call any multiplicity of interconnected techniques and actors " a continuous self-vibrating " plateau . " Aihwa Ong , " Ecologies of Expertise : Assembling Flows , Managing Citizenship , " in Global Assemblages , ed . Aihwa Ong and Stephen J. Collier ( Malden : Blackwell , 2005 ) . P.338 <p> n6 Bruno Latour talks about how the " social " has shrunk to the point that people use it as a suffix of a field such as social aspect of economics or biology . This is of course due to the fact that sociology has not been able to define what is the unit which one might call social , consequently people have begun calling things that pertain to societal interaction social , as in social aspect of biology . Like the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term for that which condition or engulf a process or technological objects , the word " social " appears to be a through in . Latour suggests that the " social " should be defined as the association of the connectors that link together various processes , people , and objects . <p> L : REFERENCES  --  Etemad , Shapoor. 2002 .
