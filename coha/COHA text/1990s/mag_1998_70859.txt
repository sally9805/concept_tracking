Your mouth is bloody . A couple of your fingers are bent in three directions . Your watch is gone . But you came out with it . // Mark McGwire 's 62nd. // Now people are pulling on you as if you 're saltwater taffy . The security goons want you to come with them  --  right now . Some guy in an Italian double-breasted is offering you $500,000 for it , cash , right now . Three TV hairsprays are trying to interview you , your wife may or may not have fainted , and two unshavens have just bum-rushed you , trying to swipe the ball . // Panicked , you throw an elbow , spin 180 degrees and jailbreak it up the aisle , out the exit and into the parking lot , where you lock yourself in somebody 's Winnebago . You need a second to think . The Winnebago owner is threatening you with a grilled kielbasa , and a very angry parade is right behind him . You 're staring blankly at the dashboard , onto which the owner has Super @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The other is Babe Ruth . // Suddenly they start to glow . And move . And speak ! // " You got ta give the ball to McGwire , kid , " says the little Ruth . " It 's the right tiling to do . " // You clean out your ears , rub your eyes and shake your head . That was a nasty bump you took . // " Do n't be a sucker ! " pipes the little Cobb , hopping up and down . " McGwire 's not gon na give you any money for it ! He said , and I quote , ' If somebody 's going to hold this ball hostage for a dollar sign , you can take it home with you . ' Easy for him to say , huh ? Makin ' almost $10 million a year . I mean , if some fool paid $500,000 for Eddie Murray 's 500th , you 'll get millions for this baby ! " // " This ai n't about money ! " roars Ruth , poking Cobb in his tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't hit it , that ball 's just a chunk of cowhide . He ought a have it . He 'd give you all the signed junk you want . Plus , you 'd be his pal for life . " // " Listen ! " yells Cobb , pointing at you . " Whaddya pull down a year , $25,000 tops ? You got a car that still runs on leaded . Your wife ai n't had a new dress since the Nixon Administration . Your kids ' teeth look like Stonehenge . You ca n't afford somebody else 's morals ! " // The tiny Ruth throws Cobb against the air freshener. // " You do n't want that ball sittin ' in some greasy billionaire 's den forever ! " shouts Ruth . " Look , a Florida man caught Barry Bonds 's 400th home run last week and gave it straight to Bonds , even though a guy in the stands offered him $5,000 . Orel Hershiser was so impressed , he gave the guy the five grand anyway ! " // " Right , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rip you a check for a million . Hey ! What about the kid who caught Roger Maris 's 61st ? Sal Durante ? He went out and got what he could for it . " // " And what has Sal Durante been doing the last 30 years ? " asks Ruth . // " Driving a bus . " // " See ! " Ruth yells , really mad now . " Why 's this got ta be about greed ? " // " Because baseball is about greed ! " Cobb bites back . He turns to you and says , " McGwire was one of the players who went on strike when the average salary was , what , more than $1 million ? Free agents sell out teammates and fans every year for greed . Why do you think that ball you 're holding is marked with a stamp that can only be seen in ultraviolet light ? Because nobody else is thinking about money ? If you give it back , you 'll be the only guy in this without greed . " // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Ruth . // " Nah . If you 're too stupid to sell it , why not open up a store at the Mall of America and charge people $5 to hold it ? You could sell stuff , too . McGwire T-shirts , McGwire sweat bands , Andro-6 . You 'd make a killin ' ! " // " Why , I ought a  --  " // The two tiny figures start to wrestle . // You think hard . Suddenly you snatch them up and zip them into your waist pouch . You unlock the Winnebago door and walk out , flipping the ball to the man with the kielbasa as the crowd gasps . From your waist pouch , you can hear the muffled Cobb and Ruth yelling , " What 'd you do that for ? " // A very large smile is on your face . // " Screw the ball , " you say . " Do you have any clue how much I 'm gon na make with you two ? "          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
