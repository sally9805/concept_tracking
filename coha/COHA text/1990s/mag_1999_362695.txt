Country like this could bring out anything in a man  --  ecstasy , murder , grace . I grow aware of this as I follow Yvon Chouinard along the rocks down an offshoot of the Snake River , in Wyoming 's Jackson Hole , in the Grand Tetons . Chouinard , 60 , the president and founder of Patagonia , the outdoor-clothing and - gear company based in Ventura , Calif. , that seems more interested in protecting the environment than its profits , is about to teach me fly-fishing . Ahead of us , the quicksilver water burbles and shushes . Across the river , the cold mountains , patched with snowfields and dark bruises , poke into a hot , dry sky more white than blue . <P> All this is new to me . Even the Rockies look different here , more brooding and stuck up . The only fishing I 've ever done is the kind Chouinard dismisses as too easy for words  --  " with live worms ! " At the local store , where we got our one-day licenses , I noted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hare 's Ear , Goofus Bug , Wild Muddler . Wild Muddler appealed to me . Chouinard  --  who is small and tightly built , with the forearms of the blacksmith he once was  --  wears green canvas sneakers with holes , a pair of yellowed sweat socks , denim shorts , a beaten cap , a Patagonia vest , of course , and a T shirt bearing the words CUTTHROAT BUSINESSMAN . It is a reference to the cutthroat trout he would like to catch ( named for the red slash across its throat ) and to the antithesis of the sort of businessman he is . He glides from rock to rock like the champion mountain climber he also once was , while I muddle wildly , tottering like a top at the end of its spin , tangling my fishing line and attempting to heed my instructor . <P> " It 's all about process , " he says , " fly-fishing and everything else . To fish with a fly is to imitate the fly at its various stages of development . As the fly is born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day and year . Sometimes the fish go for the nymph , the youngest stage , at the bottom of the river . Sometimes they wait for the flies when they are emerging upward , attached to a self-created gas bubble . When the fly matures , it lies helpless on the top of the water until the bubble explodes and frees its wings . The fish will try for it then too , and you imitate that stage with a dry fly on the surface . It 's a matter of educating yourself  --  about the insects , fish and water . It 's all about process . " <P> He begins my education by showing me dry-fly casting on a path above the river . Move the arm , not the wrist ; keep the arc of the cast between 2 and 10 o'clock . But today the fish we are going for , whitefish and cutthroats , are loitering on the bottom . So we will wet cast and roll cast instead , with little weights on the line and flies that look like nymphs . Roll casting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upriver and let it drift down in a natural motion . I find I 'm not half bad at this , thanks wholly to Chouinard , who is as aware of the process in teaching as in everything else .
