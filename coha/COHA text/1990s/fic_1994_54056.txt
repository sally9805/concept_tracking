I SEE THE CHILD AS CLEARLY as if she were directly before me . Clinging to a gray stuffed dog , she looks around , lost . She is six  --  seven at most , with fine black hair that crops her porcelain face like a heart-shaped frame . Her pale coloring contrasts starkly to her hair and I begin to think my dream is black and white when I notice the piercing blue of her eyes . <p> The air is gray , redolent with ash . The child peers inside an abandoned storefront , then picks a pebble off the windowsill to stuff into her mouth . She sees me and starts forward , but stops as if a wall has blocked her way . " Who are you ? " I ask . " What is your name ? " <p> " Such questions of a ghost , " she says . Her voice echoes off the empty street and into the chill night air . I realize then that I exist somewhere else outside this dream , and that if I am not careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , for I am not ready to leave the girl who stands just beyond me . She is shivering . As I huddle inside the thick wool comforter from my bed , I wonder why the child has no coat ? <p> Sarah stopped by on her way to visit Mother at the hospital . " I 'll be along later , " I said , not yet ready to get dressed . When my sister asked if I were getting enough sleep , I lied . I was just tired from working , I said , hating myself for pushing away Sarah 's concern as if she were only offering me a second cup of coffee . <p> Sarah left , and I spent the next hour squinting into a mirror , where I noticed for the first time the cold cream pallor and the deep shadows under my eyes that had so worried my sister . I touched my face with my fingertips , to reassure myself that the wan reflection staring back was really mine . For the first time in years , I put on powdered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheek , then leathered it upward until the line between artifact and reality was blurred . I did not bother to do anything with my hair . It had tired to a limp brown that would not hold its shape , no matter what . Though I did not feel up to going , in the end I left for the hospital to visit my mother , Ruth . <p> The dreams had been keeping me on the edge of wakefulness since the night Ruth dropped off the box filled with linens . That had been six months ago , long before Ruth 's first stroke . <p> " I want you to have these , " Ruth had said . She was not feeling well at the time , her breathing still labored from a recent bout of pneumonia . She was starting to look older , her hair thinned , a dull color that could no longer be considered silver . Her back was hunched and her hands clutched the arms of the chair so she could sit upright . <p> If Ruth were older , what did that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on me as a child , but I was now past forty , with a child  --  a son named David  --  of my own . Funny , that I could not remember her any younger than I was at that very moment . In fact , I was certain she had never been a child ; she could not have had the time . I was born to her only five years after her liberation from a concentration camp in Latvia . She was nineteen by the end of the War , already an old woman . <p> We do not get along well . Ruth does not like my husband , Jerry , and when David was born , her attitude grew even colder . She never wanted to hold the boy , never offered to watch him , or take him out to show off to her friends . It has been a source of conflict between us . I covered for her once and bought David a present when she forgot his birthday . I did this to keep peace within the family . We are such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and now David  --  that it 's important we maintain our ties , no matter what . <p> But it is often difficult to be around my mother , and that night , I could not wait for Ruth to leave . She stayed on and on , despite my subtle hints that I had other things to do . <p> " If something happened to me , if there was a fire or a robbery , " Ruth said quietly , " I could n't bear to lose what little I was able to save . " She handed me the cardboard box and I lifted open the flaps to look inside . <p> " Linen , " I said , unimpressed at first . " Thank you . " At the top was a yellowed pillowcase with a butterfly and floral pattern finely stitched in silk thread . The fabric was cold from being stored in Ruth 's unheated basement . " Who did this belong to ? " I asked , curious . <p> " It was my sister 's , " Ruth said , and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoothed the wrinkles from her skin . " All these things belonged to my family before the War . They are yours to keep now . " At that , she stood to leave . " This is all I have to remember . I leave it to you to divide with Sarah , when you 're ready . Please , take good care of these things for me . " <p> When she had gone , I pulled the box into my bedroom where I sat on the floor and stared at it , no longer curious , but afraid . Twice I reached to explore it ; twice I let my hands fall to my side . Finally , I managed to have a look inside , and like a kid pawing through a treasure chest , I pulled out the bedding and tablecloths into a pile around me . I sat , surrounded by fine linens and cottons with a sweet , musty smell woven through the fibers alongside the weft . The pillowcase caught my attention once more , and I brought it close enough to caress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft it felt against my skin . <p> I was named Lena , after Ruth 's little sister , who was killed at the age of five . I saw her picture once , when I went into my parents ' room after a bad dream . Ruth stood beside the dresser , talking aloud in her sing-song voice that I knew was her other language . I crept behind her and saw the silver framed picture of a little girl . When she noticed me , Ruth snatched the picture away to hide inside her drawer . <p> To me , Lena was little more than that one photograph  --  a statue the size of a doll , with a Dutch boy haircut , and very dark eyes . But then , with the cold pillowcase resting against my cheek , I could only think of how Lena 's face had once pressed against the fabric . I closed my eyes and drifted to a state of near sleep when something jerked me back , tugged at my sleeve . I opened my eyes to the dimly lit room and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pillowcase . Her face , a mirror-image . Lena . <p> I grew chilled , as if a hole had opened to my world and allowed something cold to fall through . To warm myself , I pulled a tablecloth from the box and wrapped it around my shoulders . I pictured myself sitting cross-legged like a guru and laughed , but then another image came to mind , one of Jews wrapped up in prayer shawls . It was something I had not seen very often , as I had only attended a Synagogue once , after my father 's death . <p> " What is the point of believing in God ? " Ruth used to ask . " What good did it do me ? " It was a question I could not answer . <p> I wrapped myself tighter inside the yellowed sheet , but it soon felt like a shroud . Rocking forward and back , I murmured a prayer for the dead , that I did not think I knew . " Yisgadol v'yis-kadash sh'mey raba . . . " A thread from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to unravel . Without knowing why , I brought the thread to my lips for a kiss . <p> MOST DAYS I awakened late with my stomach boiling , my mind stuffed full of cotton that kept me from remembering what I was to accomplish . The dreams always left me feeling disturbed , unsettled , and I cowered under the covers until I was ready to shower and let the water shock me into daylight . <p> Last week , I went to an estate sale where I saw people gathered like vultures . They clutched knickknacks , ( chachkes , as my mother called those things that serve no purpose other than to gather dust ) as if they were guarding gold treasures . <p> I have never understood the value people place on antiques . Unless they come from family , they seem worthless  --  old wood with someone else 's memories in the drawers . Yet this sale drew me to it . I opened the door to the estate sale , and stood on the threshold , where I wavered , afraid of falling into another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in a hallway packed full of people , and crushed against the wall by a stranger whose face I could not see . Panic washed through me as I struggled to catch my breath . Shoulders pushed me , elbows pressed into my neck , a cold hand touched my arm . All I could think of was how it must have felt to be buried alive , to be trapped inside a mass grave alongside the dead and the doomed . I grew frightened enough to kick the elderly man in front of me . <p> " I 'm terribly sorry , " he said , kindly . " I did not mean to push you . " <p> I made my way back toward the bedrooms where I found some Condensed Books , a large plastic bag filled with old stockings , photograph albums and cheap vacation souvenirs from every National Park in America . Nothing there that anyone could want , I thought , which made me sad . What if this were my mother 's house ? What if strangers pawed through Ruth 's belongings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's memories were worth a dollar or just fifty cents ? Without thinking I took the bag of stockings and bought them for ten dollars . I left the house feeling foolish for having spent good money on such garbage ; I had yet to do my shopping and now had only a few dollars left . I went to the grocery and bought what I could  --  a carrot , an onion , celery , and a day-old loaf of bread . <p> I was exhausted by the time I returned home , though I knew I had done nothing to deserve such fatigue . I could not stop yawning as I measured out a pot of coffee . I buried the stockings in the back yard , then chopped vegetables to start the soup , but weariness soon overcame me . Telling myself it was just for a minute , until the coffee brewed , I sat on the couch and fell asleep . <p> I see a soldier cloaked inside a dark brown haze . He watches the girl at play with her toy dog . His eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says , and laughs as the child cries when he takes her toy . <p> " The dead do not need playthings , " the soldier says . " My daughter will use this better . " <p> I follow him into haze . When I come out on the other side , I am in the next day . I look around until I spot the limp gray dog lying in a rubbish bin . Its stuffing is torn out , and a button eye dangles from the painted socket . <p> " I do n't want it , " someone screams from inside a house . " It smells like a Jew . " <p> I pick up the stuffing and fabric , and run backward through my dream to find the child . I am desperate to give her something , anything , but though I hold what remains of her childhood , the girl is now nowhere to be found . <p> I opened my eyes and got up to check the coffee . It was bitter and needed nearly a quarter cup of milk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over on the stove . The soup was dark  --  the vegetables cooked to pulp . Still , when we sat down for dinner , I was consumed with such a hunger that I felt as if I had not eaten in a week . I picked up the bowl , and downed the soup in several gulps . And then , feeling possessed , I licked the bowl clean . <p> David began to laugh . " Look at Mommy ! She 's so silly . " <p> The telephone rang and I stood to answer it . Sarah was on the other end . <p> " Come quickly . Right away , " she said . " Mother has had another stroke . " <p> Ruth had been moved to a different room . I was directed to the end of a long hallway . Nervous , I walked quickly , and pretended not to notice the old man who clutched the rail along the wall and asked for help as I passed him . <p> Sarah was crying . I held out the basket I had hastily prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least bit of attention . Then I looked at my mother , shocked to see her propped up in a chair , her hair dirty , something white around her mouth . <p> " I brought fruit , " I said , because I could not think of anything else . <p> " Is that you , Lena ? Come closer , so I can see you . " She motioned for me to sit beside her on the bed , but the room smelled strongly of urine or worse , and I could not bring myself to touch anything in it , including Ruth . <p> " Come here , little sister , " she said then , and I backed away . <p> " I ca n't stay , " I said , and made myself cough . " I have a bad cold . You might get sick . I 'll come back another time . Enjoy the fruit . " <p> I left the basket with Sarah , then turned to rush out of the room . <p> She walks toward a bus , in line alongside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to school , why have the windows been blackened ? <p> " You must find out what has happened to my little brother , Karl . I can not rest until I find him . My sister will know , " she says , facing me . " Ask Ruth , wo n't you , please ? " <p> The guard in front of the bus kicks the children between their legs to hurry them inside . She is next in line , and my heart speeds up as I watch her approach the doorway . <p> She carries something  --  a scrap of cloth , and when another guard shoves her forward , she drops it . She turns to pick it up , but the guard kicks her , and she screams . <p> " Stop , " I call . " Do n't hurt her . " The child stares at me with dull gray eyes . It is only then that I know with certainty she is already dead . " I want to help you . Please . What should I do ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before stepping up to the bus . For a moment , I think I see her face pressed against a blackened window , but it vanishes like a penny sinking to the bottom of a fountain . <p> I walk to where the cloth lies on the ground . It is a handkerchief with butterflies and flowers that match those on my pillowcase . A single thread has been pulled out , leaving a shadowy line across the fabric . <p> I clutch the handkerchief and feel something tugging , pulling against the missing string . It is the child , who is tied to me by threads I can not see . I hold the fabric tight , refusing to let go , terrified the child will fall away . This child is my aunt , my mother 's sister . I want desperately to cling to her . But as the bus pulls away , the thread breaks , and I watch helpless , as the bus disappears inside of haze . <p> The sheets were cold , drenched in sweat . I pulled on my robe before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the image of the child from my mind . Even with my eyes closed , I saw her face , an afterimage scratched in the periphery of my vision . I had come to depend on seeing her in my dreams . I did not expect to see her again . <p> Ruth had asked that I go to her house to pick up a few things she needed . She was transferring to a nursing home . After she was stable , she would come stay with me  --  until she felt well enough to go home . <p> I took out her old gray coat from the closet . It smelled badly , like wet dogs . Father had given it to her many years ago and Ruth had steadfastly refused to get rid of it . A thick gray string hung loose off the collar . When I pulled it free , the fabric began to unravel , and I had to look for a needle and thread with which to repair the hole . <p> I sat on her bed to sew . What I knew of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . She talked often about the cold , how she was always cold , always hungry . She was allowed to keep only a lightweight coat that was much too small for her . It was her job to undress the dead and sort their clothing for the Germans to re-use . Sometimes , their flesh was still frozen to the fabric . Rarely , she found money in the pockets . She had saved what small fabric scraps she could hide to sew into the lining of her coat and make it warmer . Into this , she made secret pockets , where she hid money , bread  --  anything she found that could be traded or used . <p> When I left Ruth 's house , I was so chilled that my teeth began to chatter . I put on her scruffy coat , and thrust my hands deep inside the pockets to warm them . There was a small hole in the right pocket . I worked it bigger with my finger until I could push all of my hand through into the lining of the coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a packet that I pulled out to examine . <p> It was Lena 's yellowed handkerchief . Inside were three photographs . One of Lena holding her toy dog  --  the picture I remembered from my childhood . Another of Ruth as a twelve-year-old , gripping Lena 's hand . The third was of the two girls , standing next to a little boy who was several years younger than Lena . The boy held an embroidered pillow tightly across his chest . I recognized the fabric . It matched the handkerchief . <p> I hurried to the hospital . When I had reached Ruth 's room , I ran toward her . She was sitting up in bed , staring at the television . <p> " Mother , " I said , and kneeled by the bed . " I have to talk to you . " There was no gentle way to begin it . " Did you have a little brother . . . a boy named Karl , who you never told me about ? " <p> She began to tremble , and I dropped my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She patted my hair , as she had done when I was tiny . " A brother , " she said , quietly . Suddenly , a low sigh rushed out from somewhere deep inside her . " Oh my God , " she said . " Oh God , yes . My brother , but I ca n't remember what he looked like . " <p> " Was this him ? " I asked , and showed her the picture . " What happened to him ? Tell me , Mother . " <p> She could barely speak . " Karl , " she whispered . " My baby brother . " " What happened ? " I persisted . <p> Her words , when at last they came , were not directed toward me . " After Karl was born , my mother was so busy caring for him that she hardly had time left for me . " She still caressed my hair , then stopped , as if seeing for the first time that I was in the room with her . <p> " What happened ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother as she would later forget my son . <p> " They came for us , and we hid . I was behind an open door , and Lena crouched below the wood bin . My mother held Karl inside a closet that was hidden by a large bookcase . The Germans searched the room . ' Juden , Raus '  --  Jews come out , they said . Karl began to whimper , and the Germans knew to look behind the bookcase . I watched them pull my mother out by the hair . They did not see me . Then my beloved Lena gave herself up to be with my mother . I never saw them again after that . " <p> She began to weep . I held her , not wanting to let go or even change my position , though my legs began to cramp . <p> " I had wanted him dead so many times , " she said in a whisper , " but once it happened , I asked God to take me instead . Even that small favor was not granted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trembled from holding on so tight . I gave my mother the handkerchief . " This was Karl 's , " I said , certain that was true . " All he wanted was to be remembered . You can give him that . " I believed this fervently , and my mother believed it too , for she immediately relaxed , as if she had let go of something heavy . <p> I sat on the floor and gripped the fabric of my mother 's robe , clinging to it with a fierceness I had never known . I knew that if I lost my hold on Mother , I might sever the only thread still connecting me to the past . <p> <p> By Leslie What <p> " Clinging to a Thread " is the first of several stories we have on hand from Leslie What .
