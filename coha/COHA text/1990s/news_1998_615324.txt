<p> It was a scene-stealing outburst that would have made Bette Davis proud . A bespectacled young architect was at a dinner party with friends back in the late ' 80s . Somebody made a disparaging remark about Southern food  --  " What Southern cuisine ? You mean fried chicken ? "  --  and the architect just went off on the guy . <p> " Hell , yes , fried chicken ! " he said , knocking over a glass of red wine . " Every great cuisine in the world has it . What 's the matter with it ? And what 's the matter with us ? Why are we so fascinated by other cuisines and so insecure about our own ? What 's wrong with our own culinary heritage ? " <p> And with that , Damon Fowler set out on a mission to change the way people think about Southern food . " You go to places that advertise good Southern cooking , and it 's canned lima beans with that cheap , water-impregnated smoked ham in it , and that 's not Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Newnan-born writer , who grew up in South Carolina . " It 's this bad parody of Southern food , and yet you go to those chain places and the parking lot is full . " <p> With the scent of his grandmother 's kitchen in his memory  --  and a passion for food that was awakened while he was a student in Italy  --  he was em- boldened to quit his job at a Savannah architecture firm in 1993 and write cookbooks . Combining historical rigor and a personal sensibility , his " Classical Southern Cooking " celebrates a nearly forgotten 19th-century cuisine that 's almost decadent in its melding of European restraint with West African verve . Appearing in 1995 , the book was nominated for a James Beard Award and two International Association of Culinary Professionals/Julia Child Cookbook awards . This summer , he published " Beans , Greens and Sweet Georgia Peaches " ( Broadway , $ 17.50 ) , a collection of recipes for fruits and vegetables done Southern style . At the moment , he 's finishing a book of fried chicken recipes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring  --  and licking his fingers with the satisfaction of having turned a dinner-party tiff into a successful second career . <p> At 42 , Damon Fowler is the youngest member of the Holy Trinity of Lowcountry food writers that includes high priestess Karen Hess and her chief acolyte , Hoppin ' John Martin Taylor of Charleston . Fowler keeps Sarah Rutledge 's " The Carolina Housewife " on his office mantelpiece , right next to his Book of Common Prayer and " Mrs. Hill 's Southern Practical Cookery and Receipt Book , " a facsimile edition of a 19th-century LaGrange housewife 's tome that he edited for the University of South Carolina Press ( 1995 ) . He 's friends with Italian maven Marcella Hazan , preaches an Alice Waters-like philosophy of seasonality and has won the respect of peers nationwide . <p> " The average American no longer has a memory of what good food is like , " he says . " They go to these nouvelle restaurants , and they eat this fusion junk . They think that 's supposed to be good food , so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just weird . " <p> But on a recent day  --  as he picked over produce at the local market , shelled peas in his courtyard and cooked a delicious lunch of crispy fried chicken , okra steamed with a little olive oil , field peas , fried green tomatoes and green beans with new potatoes  --  he was more the country-boy cutup than gastronomic grinch . Changing from shorts and a blue linen shirt into a pair of cutoffs that television 's Daisy Dukes would be happy to own , he was a bona fide Huckleberry ham . On the settee of his front parlor , in a 19th-century brick townhouse on West Bolton Street , is an embroidered pillow that says : " I 've had sex and I 've had food and I 'd rather eat . " <p> He jokes about going from being a Southern Baptist preacher 's kid to singing in the choir at St. John 's Episcopal Church ( " God 's frozen people " ) . Though he 's a licensed tour guide in this town of good and evil , he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> And he talks about his gardening grandfather 's last tomato  --  he died before he could eat it  --  with an almost tearful poignancy . " He wanted a tomato that would hang out of the sides of the bread . . . . That was hard eating that tomato . We let it sit on the counter until we realized that Levis would be real upset at us if we did n't eat it . " <p> He calls his maternal grandmother " Maw-Maw " and says that to this day the creaming of butter and sugar into cake batter causes her image to appear in his heart . " I can close my eyes , and I am back in my grandmother 's kitchen . That smell is my grandmother 's kitchen . " <p> Ruth Adams Bronz , a Texas-born chef and writer who reviews food books for The New York Times , recalls the first time she met Fowler . He was on a book tour of the Northeast , and she was his chauffeur . <p> " He 's like a cross between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bronz says . " He 's not one of those threatening chef Nazis who terrifies you with technique . . . . He takes the food dead seriously , but he does n't take himself seriously . " <p> Plus , she says , he 's got the nerve to call heavyweights such as Hess , Hazan and Julia Child . <p> " I met him first by a letter that he wrote me and was charmed by it , " says Atlanta-based food icon Nathalie Dupree . " He 's a Southern renaissance man . He 's the kind of person who you think will always do the right thing , but with an amazing sense of humor and quite a different slant . He does n't run with the pack . " <p> It was Fowler 's interest in art that led him to food . A graduate student in architecture at Clemson University , he went to Genoa in 1978 to study Palladio and Brunelleschi and ended up weak-kneed over pasta and pan rustica . " What really struck me in retrospect was how familiar it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my grandmother 's vegetable soup . I understood it completely . " <p> Back in the States , he bought Hazan 's books and cooked through them . Eventually , he wrote her a fan letter , and she answered that she and her husband , Victor , might like to come to Savannah someday . <p> " I did n't meet her in Italy . Somehow people got the notion that I studied with her . The most I ever studied with her were those two days that they were here , and I got these mini-cooking lessons in my kitchen . " <p> He loves to tell about the time he was making salad dressing  --  with lots of vinegar  --  and Hazan yelled : " ' That 's enough ! ' " Then she realized she was n't in her own cucina . <p> " ' Oh , excuse me , ' " Fowler says , mimicking her accent . " ' I 'm under your table . ' Her big thing was ' I 'm under your roof . ' " <p> Based on what she heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his corn sticks  --  she decided to put her name behind it . It took him seven years to finish , and it 's dedicated to Hazan , Hess and his grandmother . <p> Sandy Oliver , a Maine writer whose award-winning " Saltwater Foodways " is a classic piece of regional culinary history , says that Fowler is universally admired . " If I had a question about Southern food , I 'd call Damon first . " <p> What distinguishes his work , she says , is that he does more than shuffle through old recipes . " I think he pays attention to the recipes , but I do n't think he stops there . He comes at it with a sense of fun . That makes it . That gives it a life . " <p> Though he has a collection of Victoriana  --  including a bust of the British monarch with the label " Our Lady of Non-Amusement " attached to the base  --  and though he specializes in 19th-century food , Fowler is forward-thinking . <p> " You got to keep building on history , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget our roots and lose them , but we do n't need to wallow in them , either . You ca n't go back . We would n't want to go back . I do n't want a kitchen with an open hearth and no Cuisinart .
