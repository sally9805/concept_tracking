Welfare as America has known it since the Depression is just about dead and buried . The end game began in the Senate on Saturday , and the debate is already furious . Some of the proposed bill 's prescriptions , such as requiring teen mothers on welfare to live at home or attend school , are long overdue . And Bob Dole has cleverly worked to smooth the harshest provisions of the House legislation . The drive to cut funds to moms who have more kids while on welfare , for example , would be left for the states as an option rather than mandated by Washington . That 's the good news . The rest ranges from moderately bad to callous and counterproductive . <P> The central change involves ending welfare as an entitlement . Being poor will no longer mean automatic qualification for benefits , so some needy people will be ignored . Worse still , the entire level of federal welfare spending will be cut by about $70 billion over seven years , and the states will be spared the burden of contributing any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that cruel , but curtailing their obligations is stupid . Currently , states contribute about 40% of the entire pie of cash welfare assistance , and it 's the level of state participation  --  the dollar amount per recipient  --  that now governs Washington 's piece of the total funding . That 's why benefit levels among states vary so dramatically . If states are no longer required to pony up their own funds as a condition of federal help , the money they do earmark for welfare will have to compete with every other program . In battles like those , the politically powerless lose , and no group has less clout than the poor . In fact , this truism has already caused welfare benefits to decline about 40% in constant dollars over the past 20 years . States strapped for cash  --  as all of them are  --  cut welfare first . <P> Considered together , the new bill 's changes will make a mockery of the proclaimed goal of " reforming " welfare by moving people off the dole and into work . There 's little use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's still a chance to improve the Senate bill with floor amendments . <P> As an entitlement , welfare spending currently rises when recessions hit , which is the system 's least objectionable aspect . Workers laid off during hard times deserve help , and that assistance is usually temporary . Under the new law , spending wo n't increase during recessions ( which also helps end the economic decline ) , so those most worthy could be left in the cold . The " contingency fund " that several Republican Governors favor could alleviate this deficiency . " There has to be some give in the program , " says Ohio Governor George Voinovich , whose own welfare reforms are among the most intelligent in the country . " But it takes money , " Voinovich concedes , " and too many in Congress , including too many in my own party , simply have n't a clue about what it 's really like to be poor in this country . Yet if we 're supposed to get serious about getting people to work , which is what everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes . " Voinovich would also have contingency funds available for job training and child care , " without which , " he says , " no serious welfare-to-work program can do the job . "
