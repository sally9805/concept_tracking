HOW MANY WAYS CAN YOU TAKE IN THE TUBE ? Between broadcast television , cable TV , fiber-optic cable , digital compressed cable and variously sized satellite dishes , there may soon be as many delivery systems as there are channels to choose from . Now the FCC has added yet another wrinkle to videotic variety , tentatively approving a nationwide television-transmission system much like the one used to send and receive cellular phone calls . <P> The new system , developed by a New Jersey firm called CellularVision , has been operating in Brooklyn since July . It uses microwave signals of such high frequency that they can bounce off buildings and still be received by a window-mounted antenna no bigger than a magazine . The system , which could be available throughout New York City and in other major TV markets by mid-1994 , can deliver as many channels as cable TV without the expense of having to wire up each individual home  --  a prospect that could threaten the virtual monopoly that many cable companies currently enjoy .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
