WHEN DECIDING WHICH MEDICAL STUDIES TO BElieve , it 's usually wise to consider who 's paying the bill . Not always , though . While some research suggests that electromagnetic fields  --  the kind given off by power lines and household appliances  --  may increase the incidence of cancer , the latest in-depth study of the question shows no evidence of danger . Even though the research was financed by Southern California Edison , a major electric utility with an obvious financial stake in exonerating its product , the findings , published in the journal Epidemiology , appear to be legitimate . <P> Even scientists who are concerned about power lines acknowledge that the Edison study was a good one . Researchers from the company and from UCLA looked at more than 36,000 Edison employees who had on-the-job exposure to EMFs . Those with the highest exposure did not have especially high cancer rates . Does this prove that EMFs do n't cause cancer ? No  --  just that we still do n't know .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
