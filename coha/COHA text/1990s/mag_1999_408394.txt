The many traditional and functional objects still being created today are properly defined as craft . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemporary work that can claim aesthetic value equal to that of fine art . Little separates the second group from fine art other than the labels and the mind-set underlying them . Yet all craft is lumped together in a single category and continues to be treated as a second-class citizen by the art world . If the status of fine art is to be achieved , aesthetic craft objects must be presented in a way that is credible to those seriously interested in art . The challenge is to convey that craft can be a sophisticated , intellectual , even philosophical mode of expression . What brought these thoughts to mind was " Contemporary International Basketmaking , " an exhibition organized by the Crafts Council , London , and the Whitworth Art Gallery , Manchester , and shown at both venues. , The ambitious task ofthe curatorial team2 ofthis biggest survey of basketry ever staged in Great Britain , with almost zoo pieces by 6o makers worldwide , was to show that " basketry has grown beyond its traditional roots to become a form of aesthetic expression in contemporary art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal . Their fundamental mistake was to display the works according to technique , intermingling traditional baskets with those created by contemporary artistmakers . This might have seemed a good idea on paper , an opportunity to look at things from a new perspective-to see Photograph Photograph Photograph TOP TO BOTTOM : MICHAEL DAVIS , United StatesFlower Series-Yellow Dahlia in Blossom , 1997 , reed , acrylic and enamel paint , quilting pins , tin , stake and strand technique , 19 by 28 by 28 inches ; UENO MASAO , Japan-Minimal Surface 3 , i998 , bamboo , coiled , iz by zo by 20 inches ; LINDA KELLY , United States-Form 9.1.3 , 1998 , flat reed splint , plaited , 643/4 by 16 by 17 3/4 , inches , photo/ Larry Schwarm .
