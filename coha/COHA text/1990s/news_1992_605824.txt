<p> A year after the Persian Gulf War , the weak economy and uneasy social balance that underlie Jordan 's monarchy are being challenged by one of the war 's most far-reaching and yet seemingly forgotten results : the migration of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to Jordan from Kuwait . <p> This huge population transfer , which has been mounting steadily since August 1990 , is being called " the third uprooting " by Palestinian spokesmen , after the mass departures from Israel in 1948 and from the occupied territories in 1967 . By now , fewer than 50,000 Palestinians are believed to remain in Kuwait out of a population estimated at 400,000 before the war , according to international human rights observers . Half of the Palestinian population fled in fear of the invading Iraqi troops . After Iraq 's ouster , tens of thousands more fled because of Kuwaiti retribution for perceived Palestinian support of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein . <p> While the exodus has created a new trauma for Palestinians , it may have even bigger implications for Jordan , which , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 300,000 of the refugees . Jordan 's government politely calls the immigrants " returnees , " because most carry the Jordanian passports that have long been the primary diplomatic document available to the stateless Palestinians . But for many of the returnees , as well as their Jordanian hosts , the current union is one of dire necessity rather than choice . <p> One former Palestinian resident of Kuwait , Abdullah Salin , offers a living testament of the new migrants ' plight  --  as well as a history of Palestinian displacement over the past four decades : Born in 1942 in an Arab village near Haifa , he had fled with his family to the West Bank during the 1948 war that created Israel , then was uprooted again when Israel captured the West Bank in 1967 . <p> Salin spent the next 23 years working in Kuwait as a government-employed truck driver , and his seven children were all born there . Last August , however , the family moved to Jordan when Salin lost his job and residence permit because of a Kuwaiti decision to dismiss Palestinians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his large family in two bare concrete rooms , and tries to stretch his savings of $ 8,000 by selling hummus and falafel at a small stand . <p> For now , Salin has taken up residence in the Baqaa camp north of the capital , where more than 100,000 Palestinians live . U.N . officials say 300 families from Kuwait have moved in there , most of them surviving on charity or on meager savings from Kuwait . <p> Although Salin said he will look for employment around the region , he believes his family now has no choice but to find a place for itself in Jordan . " We were small boys when we left Palestine in 1948 , " he said , squatting on a mattress in his rented rooms . " But we grew up with the problems , and our problems grew with us . This is our tragedy . " <p> Many Jordanians , however , are reluctant to sympathize with Salin 's predicament . They see newcomers like Salin as aliens who threaten to swamp the kingdom 's already strained economy and test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Palestinians and native Jordanians . <p> The pressures created by the Palestinian influx have been a major factor behind King Hussein 's relatively enthusiastic embrace of the U.S.-brokered Middle East peace process , diplomats here say . At the same time , the migration has prompted a subtle but unmistakable political backlash among Jordanians in the political and security establishment , who fear a growing Palestinian demographic advantage may eventually threaten their position in the country . <p> " This big influx has changed the ratio of the population strongly in favor of Palestinians , and it has upset the status quo in the country , " said a senior figure of Palestinian origin , who asked not to be named . " No one wants to talk about this in public , but everybody knows it 's a fact . " <p> Remarkably , from the Jordanian point of view , the country 's refugee problem has attracted little of the attention and none of the international financial support focused on neighboring Israel 's reception of Soviet Jews , even though the increase in Jordan 's population has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have entered Israel , with a population of 5 million , in the last two years , prompting Israel 's request for $ 10 billion in U.S. loan guarantees to finance their absorption . By contrast , Jordan had a population of only 3.3 million before the flood of migrants from Kuwait , and its economy was only one-tenth the size of Israel . Meanwhile , the government 's pleas for international aid have fallen on deaf ears , both in the West and in the Arab world . <p> " We talked to the Americans and we talked to the Europeans , but the response was minimal , " said Taher Masri , who was prime minister for five months last year . " They seemed to be saying , ' We ca n't afford you . ' " <p> Unlike the Jews coming to Israel from the former Soviet Union , the returning Palestinians do not need to learn a new language or culture , and many have savings from Kuwait . The International Monetary Fund recently estimated that the immigrants brought some $ 475 million with them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been unable to obtain their own housing and 80 percent are unemployed , in a country where , according to government estimates , unemployment ranges from 20 to 30 percent . Sixty thousand are living in swollen , U.N.-managed refugee camps around Amman , while others have found temporary living quarters with relatives or friends . <p> For tens of thousands of Palestinians , Jordan is their new home simply because they have no other place to go . Many say they see the country as merely another refuge , rather than a homeland , even if they carry Jordanian papers . " Nothing can compensate for our own country , " said Palestinian Mohammed Milhelm , a former resident of Kuwait and member of a committee set up in Jordan to help the returnees . " We know we are not at home here , even if we make up the majority of the population . " <p> Still , Palestinians who lived in Jordan before the new influx  --  and who by most accounts already made up a majority of the country 's population  --  perceive the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armed Palestinian groups in Jordan , they note , the country has lived by an unwritten but clear social contract . While Palestinians have been eligible for citizenship and have grown to dominate the private business sector , they have been virtually excluded from the security services , the armed forces , and even the civil service . <p> While that formula has kept the country stable and allowed Palestinians to prosper , the new influx of Palestinians has renewed the question of Jordan 's identity in the long term , the Palestinians say . Can it remain a quaint kingdom , ruled by a dynasty installed by Britain and controlled by a bedouin minority ? Or will it evolve  --  perhaps in partnership with the neighboring Palestinian West Bank and Gaza Strip  --  into a Palestinian-ruled republic ? <p> The current peace process , in which Jordan is officially part of a joint delegation with Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza , has fueled the quiet debates here even further .

" Palestinians talk about it among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And as far as the Palestinians are concerned , we have no doubt in our minds that one day there will be a strong association between the West Bank and Jordan . " <p> Jordanians and some Western observers respond that , despite Jordan 's cautious experimentation with democratic elections since 1989 , no such shift of power could be accomplished peacefully . But they acknowledge that native Jordanian anxiety is growing . One sign , several observers said , was the stiff political resistance encountered by Masri , a Palestinian , in attempting to head a government last year  --  resistance from native Jordanians and based in part on Masri 's Palestinian origin . <p> " If the Palestinians are a majority , so what ? " said Jordanian economist Fahd Fanek . " They must make a choice . Either they are Jordanians and accept the Jordanian system . . . or , if they define themselves as Palestinians , they must be excluded from the governing system .
