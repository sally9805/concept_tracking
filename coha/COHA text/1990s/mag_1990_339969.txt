How many homeless people are there in America ? Who are they ? On the night of March 20 , the U.S. Census Bureau will try to find out with a nationwide sweep of shelters , public parks , subways and sidewalk heating grates . Enumerators  --  the bureaucratic euphemism for headcounters  --  have been warned not to search parked cars or Dumpsters and not to enter abandoned buildings ; nor may they question people who are sleeping or obviously disoriented . <P> There is concern that the project will somehow demean the homeless . That 's beside the point , reply city officials . The homeless will be among the first , to benefit when their communities use the tally to apply for more federal funds . And a documented increase in population  --  homeless or not  --  could lead to greater representation in the Congress and in state legislatures.
