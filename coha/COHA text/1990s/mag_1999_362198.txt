It was n't so long ago that politicians talked at us incessantly . They were scolds , know-it-alls , flatterers , braggarts , blowhards , loudmouths , balloon-juice merchants  --  choose your epithet . They were in love with the sound of their own voice . They would n't shut up . You could gag them with terry cloth , wrap them in cellophane , dump them in the Mariana Trench  --  you could plug your ears with a Walkman and crank up a Def Leppard CD to 10  --  and still you 'd hear the little tinny yap-yap of some office seeker promising cleaner streets , safer subways , cavity-free teeth . There was no end to the talking . It was inescapable , depressing , mind numbing . Those were the days ! Now it 's worse , much worse . Now they listen . <P> The paragon of this new phase in political non-discourse is Hillary Clinton , the nation 's most prominent office seeker . But let 's be fair . After all , she is only one of many politicians who have recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like her husband , Mrs. Clinton senses unerringly the trajectories of American politics and manages with supernatural ease to embody them . Thus as she begins her pursuit of office she declines to become a campaigner . She has become a listener . <P> The barnstorming circuit she is currently making in New York State is even called a listening tour . By all accounts it 's an odd event indeed . An audience of citizens is selected and gathered before her . While she listens they share their concerns , speak from their experience , give vent to their grievances . " She wants to listen to New Yorkers in small groups , " her spokesman has said , " and learn about the issues that matter to them most . " In an amazing telepathy that even the great Kreskin would envy , these issues turn out to be the ones that matter most to Mrs. Clinton too . <P> It is all a sham , of course . But we can learn a lot from the con jobs our public servants deploy , and so it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and now we really are being fair  --  is not the only politician who is lending us her ears . " Listening " has become mandatory in a state-of-the-art campaign , regardless of the candidate 's party or ideology . As he was preparing his campaign , George W. Bush made clear he was n't going to be a chatterbox , either . " I need to go out and listen to what people have to say , " he said , by way of explaining why he refuses to tell us what he has to say . At events in Iowa and New Hampshire , Bill Bradley enters the room and announces , " I 'm here to listen . Tell me your stories . " Bradley says he is a candidate of " big ideas , " but he has been too busy listening to describe them to us . You can hear some variation from all the men ( and one woman ) who would be President . As she began her run for the presidency , Elizabeth Dole said , " I want to hear from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positions on all these issues . " <P> But is n't it supposed to work the other way around ? Give the earlier gasbags their due : annoying as they were , the pontificating pols at least stuck to the traditional democratic format . They talked ; we listened . They presented themselves and their ideas , such as they were , and then let the voters choose  --  in the blessed silence of the voting booth . The arrangement seemed to work rather well , and allowed for such democratic necessities as leadership , principle and the disinterested formulation of ideas .
