Having begun the day with a headache , Bonnie Saks was not particularly surprised to find herself finishing it the same way . Pain , in her experience , never disappeared ; it merely retreated for a while and then came back when least convenient in another form . Like men , she thought . <p> All afternoon there had been a chilly , puttering rain ; now , though the sky had cleared with the onset of dusk , she could feel the dampness lingering in her sinuses , her extremities . Perhaps she was coming down with the flu . She hoped so . Stuck in rush-hour traffic , the tinny roar of the heater her only comfort , she conceived a vision of herself dozing in bed , sipping fatty soups , watching TV , and acting generally like the pampered creature she was destined but for circumstance to be . Oh God , she hoped to hell it was the flu . But she did not really think it was . <p> Meanwhile there was this pain in her head , which was considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relieve . She massaged her temples . She listened to some jazz . She performed a deep breathing exercise . When none of these worked , she fished in her shoulder bag for the aspirin she had resolved some time ago to start carrying there but as yet , apparently , did not . Just as well . Her stomach would n't have been able to handle them , anyway . <p> Her stomach , of course , was the real problem ; it had been queasy for days . Now it was running through its full repertoire of post-red meat convulsions , trying to cope with the enormous trapezoidal hamburger Alex , her eight-year-old , had ( as he did every second Tuesday of the month ) overcooked for her , and which Bonnie , standing at the sink with her coat on , staring dolorously into the charred , soapy skillet , had bolted down in record time . Alex 's hamburger , truth be told , had actually tasted pretty good . She regretted it now , of course , on her way to the school meeting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not her fate : to do and to regret . <p> " When 's Cress coming ? " Alex had asked , watching her eat . <p> Bonnie checked her watch . " Ten minutes ago . As usual . " <p> " It 's not fair . Why ca n't we stay alone ? " <p> " Because you ca n't . " <p> " Why not ? " <p> Bonnie allowed her eyes to close , just for a moment , as if savoring the delicious witticism that was her life . " Because , " she sighed , " you ca n't . " <p> " It 's not fair , " Alex repeated . " I can put Petey to bed , you know . I 've done it lots of times . " <p> " I thought you liked Cress . I thought you had fun with her . " <p> " I do . I 'm just saying , we do n't need her . All she does is watch TV , anyway . " <p> " She 's a babysitter . They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards right people will pay you to watch TV all night , too . " <p> As he hunched over his plate , his eyebrows knit together in skepticism , Bonnie , for one painful moment , recognized in the boy the coiled , recalcitrant DNA of his father . " Yeah , right , " he said . <p> " Baby , please . It 's been a rotten day . Give me a break , okay ? " <p> He made a grudging frown . <p> " Is there anything left in the fridge for Cress ? " <p> " Not much . Couple of apples . Mustard . " <p> " All right , so I 'll leave my credit card . If she 's hungry she can order a pizza . " <p> " Large or small ? " <p> Bonnie waved her hand in exasperation . " Whichever she wants . <p> " I thought we were so broke , " Alex sneered . <p> Half an hour later , sitting on the padded floor of the preschool 's gym , Bonnie tasted the hamburger again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had eaten that day . Things were backing up on her . Her gaze swept over the wrestling mats laid out around her like some pale , meandering dream . Life is containment , she thought : a bird feathering a cage . The problem was very deep . It was not , for example , just the meetings . It was not the five-figure debts . It was not the lousy apartment , the lousy sinuses , the succession of lousy jobs . Nor was it her daily existence with the kid  --  the weekends lost to laundry and videos , the evening grind of dinner-bath-story , and then the hour or so of studying , that small rhetorical gesture meant to impress upon herself that she did indeed have a will of her own , a life of her own , before she surrendered to exhaustion and fell heavily into her unshared , and often unmade , bed . No , what afflicted her was larger than any one thing . Possibly it was even larger than the dissertation which lay , half-formed and loveless , across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door had once opened to a burgeoning closet ; now , scarred by coffee rings , it led only to the narrow little sub-basement that was her despair . <p> " Hey , Bon . " <p> Larry Albeit , Anya 's father , sat down beside her on the wrestling mat and officiously zipped open his jacket . " Better get comfortable : he said . " We 're in for a long one . " <p> " Oh no . Not tonight . " <p> " Oh yes . " He loosened his tie . " Next year 's budget . Remember last year ? It 'll go on for hours . " <p> " But it ca n't . I told the sitter I 'd be home by nine . " <p> Larry Albeit shrugged , and offered her a wide-angle view of his high white teeth . What did he care ? A lawyer in a litigious culture , meetings were the connective tissue of his life . Besides , at home he had his cheery wife , Kip , reading Madeline to the girls , free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I 'm getting coffee . Want some ? " <p> " Yeah , okay . " <p> " Caf or decaf ? " <p> She hesitated . One would have thought from the amount of time it required that the choice was a profound one . " I 'll have decaf , " she said , more to herself , as it turned out , than to Larry , who had already sprung up and bounced gallantly away to fetch it . <p> " Okay , guys , " said Geoff Dahlberg , brandishing his clipboard . " I move that we get started . Lots of business tonight . " <p> First the secretary , Bill Lake , went over the minutes from the previous month , which had to be accepted by voice vote into the record . Then Bethany Freitag gave the membership report , Eileen Smith reviewed the curriculum proposals , and Howard Peeler gave an update on the physical plant renovations . After which the treasurer , Alice Orkin , was called upon to give her report , which she most forcefully did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a change , though barely , and that was n't taking into account the rent increase and the all but certain rise in staff salaries that would come in the spring . To cover these expenditures , tuition would have to go up , but then tuition went up every year . The only question was how much . <p> Alice , smiling , brandished one of her CPI charts . A photographer 's assistant , she spent her days behind the scenes , fetching props , soothing models , fiddling with lights and shadows ; only on the second Tuesday of each month could she emerge with her laser-printed graphs and charts and command everyone 's attention . Not that Bonnie begrudged her . She , too , often dreamed of stepping out from the shadows and into the light . But armed with what ? <p> " Thank you , " Geoff said , bobbing over his clipboard . " Those are fine reports . We all appreciate the work you guys put in <p> Alice , Howard , Bethany , Eileen , and Bill nodded in acknowledgement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old business , I move we proceed to the memo you received in your boxes last week , concerning the benefits package . Now , those of you who survived last year 's meetings may recall these budget issues get kind of delicate , and tend to generate some pretty strong emo  --  " <p> " Geoff ? " A hand was in the air , bunched into a fist . It belonged to Ginny Stern , whose kid , Jason , was the precocious darling of Petey 's class . Why should n't he be ? He had a bright , principled , outspoken mother who took him to museums on the weekend and to France in the summer so he 'd grow up bilingual , and the presence of whose hand in the air just now did not bode well , Bonnie thought , for the pace of the evening . <p> " I 'm confused , " Ginny said . It was her standard opening , and as usual not even remotely true . " Why are we using Styrofoam again ? " She pointed accusingly to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was in fact comprised of materials that would outlive them all . " I thought we settled this issue months ago , " she said . <p> Geoff , his brow furrowed , looked around for help . <p> " She 's right , " said Bill Lake , checking his notes . " September 17 : unanimous vote . " <p> " I 'd like to know what happened to the mugs my committee went out and bought for replacements , " Ginny said . " I gave them to Sara myself . " <p> All eyes turned to Sara Montague , the waifish assistant director , who was sitting in the back of the room with her knees up , stitching flowers on a macrame tablecloth . It was Sara 's job to stock the kitchen . Several times in the past , this had brought her into direct engagement with Ginny Stern , often on the losing side . But now her expression was serene . " Mugs ? " Sara asked faintly , as if recalling some benign distant obsession . <p> " There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Oh , those were no good . I had them inspected . " <p> " Inspected ? " Ginny looked dubious . <p> " By a ceramicist . She said they were improperly fired , and anyway there 's too much lead in the glaze . " <p> " But they 're from Conran 's . " <p> " Well , they 're a health hazard . " <p> " So 's Styrofoam , " Ginny shot back . <p> " Yes , but that 's environmental . It 's completely different . " <p> All this time Bonnie was staring at the soggy toes of her shoes , wondering : her mugs at home  --  were n't a couple of them from Conran 's , too ? Was she poisoning the kids ? Wait , but the kids did n't drink coffee . Thank God , she thought : she was only poisoning herself . <p> " Listen , folks Geoff said , " I do n't mean to cut off this discussion , but we 've got a long agenda . I move that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Styrofoam tonight , and meanwhile let 's ask the food committee to purchase new mugs , safe ones , for next time . Anyone want to second ? " <p> Several people rushed to second it . Bonnie , sipping surreptitiously from her contraband cup , would have , too , but did not dare open her mouth . Already she had acquired a reputation as something of a loose cannon : fickle in her loyalties , wanting in seriousness , slow to volunteer . Doubtless it was all true . She simply did not feel like a good citizen these days . She lacked the time , the energy , the patience ; ultimately , she lacked the will . It was a shameful thing to admit at this point in global culture , but she 'd about had it with participatory democracy  --  she 'd have been happier just writing out a check every month and letting paid professionals make all the decisions ; or , better , to give herself over to a benevolent fascist dictator for a while , to have at least a few of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she thought . At times the name rose inside her reflexively , like bile . <p> It was Kevin who had talked her into this cooperative preschool in the first place . Parent involvement , he 'd said , was the coming thing : responsible , statistically persuasive , and cheaper to boot . Which was approximately the same line of reasoning he 'd applied a few months later to getting divorced . <p> But that was n't altogether fair . Strictly speaking , Kevin had been no more to blame in the matter than Bonnie herself , who had after all done no one any good by sleeping with an old boyfriend , Stanley Gottlieb , at the M.L.A. in San Francisco , for reasons that remained shrouded in fog even now . She 'd been five months pregnant with Petey at the time ; she remembered thinking , rather magically in retrospect , that the extra layers of flesh would somehow insulate her from consequence . But they had n't , of course . And now here she was . Stanley still made an occasional appearance , flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost incidentally , to screw up her life ; but Kevin , that dear , sweet , narcissistic mess , was gone  --  decamped to Ecuador , where he was finishing his post-doc and working with a psychoanalyst to overcome his innumerable blocks . He must have been making some progress down there , too , because of late his child support checks had begun to arrive roughly the same month they were due . <p> No , it was no longer quite so easy as it once was , blaming Kevin . <p> " ... and now , " Geoff was saying , " if you 'll turn to page three , you 'll see the charts drawn up by the personnel committee , detailing the various benefit packages available to the staff ... " <p> Bonnie dutifully studied the charts . The fact that they were incomprehensible to her , though discouraging , was predictable enough  --  she had never done well in statistics  --  and after the first few seconds her eyes began skating giddily over the numbers , making figure eights and pirouettes in the margins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trivial nature of her thoughts . The mind , she 'd once read , is just a piece of paper blown around by the wind . But the nice thing about meetings was that she could just sit there and let these competent , initiative-seizing people  --  the grown-ups , she caught herself thinking  --  bear her along . She could coast . Coasting , under the circumstances , was a rare pleasure , the kind of minor indulgence , like getting high in the bathtub or devouring a quart of ice cream , in which embittered people seek consolation for their grievances , and Bonnie would have been perfectly capable of enjoying it if not for her headache , and the way Alex 's hamburger had settled in her stomach , and the test she would have to give herself the next morning , of which the hamburger , in its small dyspeptic way , was a reminder . <p> " Can I say something ? " asked Lucia Todd-Frazen , interrupting a discussion of the dental plan . <p> Geoff , sitting in a yoga position at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just want you all to know that Harvey and I  --  and I think I speak for both of us even though he 's not here tonight ? Because we really love you guys on staff , the work you do , you 're like part of our family , your patience , your involvement , your ... and we believe in labor , we do . We support it . Even though we 're not technically working class ourselves , of course , and sometimes , like with the Teamsters , or the restaurant workers downtown , a couple years ago , those indictments ? ... But what I want to say is that this measure , we support it , both of us do ... completely <p> The tremulousness of Lucia 's voice and the circuity of her phrasing were of a nature so profound that a kind of collective sigh went up at the end of her speech , that any additional pain might be spared her . Such is the tyranny of the shy . But her message had touched a nerve . A weight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction of posturing . Parents of both genders began to let fly with the most ringing pro-labor sentiments heard in these parts since the McGovern days . What kind of lousy package were we offering our staff , anyway ? Dental was one small part of an intricate puzzle . What about , for instance , workmen 's comp ? <p> " Workpersons , ' " grumbled Thea Doyle . <p> What about mental health ? Job security ? Paternity leave for the men ( both gay , as it happened ) on staff ? A flurry of amendments were proposed ; each had to be discussed for a while before being tabled and referred to the appropriate committee chairperson , that it might be studied and further discussed at the next meeting . Several voice votes were taken , anyway . Bonnie tried to participate , but her mouth , for some reason , had lost the talent to issue sounds . One by one , her powers were deserting her . Pretty soon it was nine-thirty , and she had to go to the bathroom again , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little rumpled . <p> Then Lucia cleared her throat again , and everyone froze . <p> " I just want to say this issue , the one we 're discussing ? I 've had it for a long time . Because my life , it used to be a different ... a different ... like that proposition for the farmworkers , back in ' 81 ? I worked on that . Harvey did n't want me to at first , he thought it took too much time away , I guess , I do n't really remember what he thought . But I said , Harvey ? I believe in labor . I believe people who work hard , and who have families like us , should make as much as we make , and should have benefits that are just as good , and , and , this is very important for me . I have a real issue with  --  " <p> Jesus Christ , thought Bonnie . Gim me a break . <p> And then an odd thing happened . Lucia halted ; her face went white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sob . It was as if through some dreadful ventriloquism Bonnie 's thoughts had been heard by everyone . Which was impossible . And yet there Lucia stood , damp-eyed and immobile on the wrestling mat . From the clench of her hands , she might have been grappling with an angel . <p> Under normal circumstances , the sight of Lucia Todd-Frazen getting emotional at a meeting was no more surprising or upsetting a phenomenon than the buzzing of the sodium lights in the parking lot outside . But tonight it seemed to Bonnie that the evening 's very skin had been punctured . Horrified , she tried to remember : Had she said the words aloud ? She 'd done everything else wrong that day , why not this , too ? Oh God , her nature , her true nature , had finally revealed itself : She 'd said something bitchy and awful , severed the cord that bound civilized , cooperative people together , and now they 'd all hate her . And meanwhile it would be Petey , who was already tormented nightly by dreams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skinny nose , a small parody of her own , could not be persuaded to stop running  --  it would be Petey who 'd suffer the consequences . <p> Abruptly , she stood , muttering something about the bathroom  --  it was true , she really did need to go  --  all the while hoping no one would notice the tremble in her voice , or the inflamed condition of her cheeks and nose , or the tears that were now in her eyes , too . There was no accounting for them ; they 'd simply arrived , dumbly , brutishly , like strange orphan children towards whom she felt no family feeling but for whom she understood herself somehow responsible . Room would have to be made , but where ? There was no room left . <p> Only when she was alone in the bright tiled shelter of the bathroom did the anxiety subside a bit . Standing at the sink , she splashed cold water on her face , sensing that some personal crisis  --  she could not have said what  --  had just been narrowly avoided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's speech , in the momentary stillness , continued to galumph indignantly through her head . I have a real issue with this . When had issues become possessions , Bonnie wondered , and why did n't she own more of them herself ? But then she did , did n't she ? She owned plenty . What would it matter , if she added to the pile one more ? <p> There were no paper towels , so she wiped her hands on her jeans , which she intended to throw out soon , anyway , because they were threadbare and shapeless , like so much of what passed for her wardrobe , from when she was pregnant with Petey . <p> Back out in the hallway , she lost a moment or two to indecision , trying to establish whether it was better to return to the gym or maybe just leave . Either way she would be late getting home . So she stopped at the phone in the hallway to call Cress . <p> The line was busy , of course . Cress was a popular girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing of her feckless and unimaginative babysitting skills , Cress emanated something , a kind of low , gravitational hum , a calm , that strongly endeared her to other people , particularly children and men . Or were these two different categories ? Standing at the phone , the busy signal pounding away angrily at the protective insulation of her heart  --  what now ? what now ?  --  Bonnie turned to look over the construction-paper cutouts of lions and monkeys that the two-year-olds had done that week ( Petey 's , she was relieved to discover , was no more crude or haphazard than any of the others ' ) , and two of the tears she had worked so hard to suppress back in the gym finally worked their way free . <p> " Hey , Bon ? " Larry Albeit was approaching her with a concerned look . " You okay ? " <p> Bonnie touched a finger to her cheek , where it was warm and wet . " Okay ? " she said . <p> " You 're crying . " <p> " So ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was , you know , something wrong . Sometimes it helps , you know , to talk about things . " <p> Bonnie shook her head . Talk ? Things ? Things were the problem . Talk was the problem . Men were the problem . Nothing that Larry Albeit was offering could possibly be of any constructive benefit . " We should probably get back , " she said . " The meeting . " <p> " Ah ... " Larry waved his wrist cavalierly and  --  unless she was out of her mind  --  actually blushed . " Fuck the meeting . " <p> " Really ? " Despite herself , Bonnie giggled . The sound it made in the hallway was so loud , so awful and garish , that it might have issued from the wall of paper jungle animals behind her . <p> " Listen , come on out to the car . I 've got a joint in the glove compartment that has your name on it . " <p> Bonnie hesitated . Lately all the junctions in her life 's road seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Want to Be Least ? But it so happened that she had never seen such a thing as a joint with her name on it before , and it was partly in hopes of making up for a lifetime of such deprivations , or so she told herself , that she followed Larry Albeit out to the parking lot . There his Volvo lay gleaming under the streetlight 's yellow halo , enormous and sleek , a vehicle for all the soul 's burdensome dreams . Larry got in behind the wheel , and Bonnie , quickly , so as not to change her mind , climbed in on the passenger 's side . The position gave her an odd sensation of backwardness , of the self inverted by mirrors  --  she was accustomed to being the driver , not the driven  --  but in the end she decided that it was no stranger , in fact , than anything else . <p> " Now ... " Larry , bent over , was fumbling in the glove compartment with his right hand , creating in the process no small amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd I put that little sucker ? " <p> " Never mind she said . " It does n't matter . " <p> " It does n't ? " <p> " Not to me . I 'm happy just to be out of there . " <p> Larry , face pressed sideways to the wheel , mumbled vaguely . <p> " I 'm living the wrong life , " she said . <p> " Mmm ... " <p> " I mean , let 's face it , these college towns ... these people with their issues , their meetings that go on forever , their perfect kids who just happen to go to private schools , their potluck dinners with tabouli and lasagna  --  how do you stand it ? " <p> " Actually , " Larry admitted , " I kind of like lasagna . " <p> " Oh , " she said bitterly , " so do I. At least I think I used to . That 's what 's so awful . All these things I used to really like , and now I ca n't stand them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? " <p> " Oh no , I would n't say wrong ... " <p> " Well , I do n't care if there is . I mean , good lord , she was crying over dental benefits in there . " <p> " Lucia , " Larry allowed mildly , " has strong convictions . " <p> " Well , so do I. And one of them is she 's wacko . " <p> " Oh , she 's not really so bad . Everyone , you know , they just want to do things the right way for the kids . Avoid the old mistakes . Sometimes it makes people clumsy . But all in all they 're doing their best . " <p> " Yeah , yeah . I know . " <p> Bonnie leaned against the door , too cold ( she 'd left her coat in the gym ) and too tired , all of a sudden , to be properly ashamed of her own small-mindedness . The door itself was so much more substantial a piece of metal than the door of her shitty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be accurately described by the same word . " Can you turn on the heater ? " she asked . " I 've been cold all day . " <p> " Sure . " <p> Larry turned his key in the ignition , and the car purred to life . The heater made virtually no noise at all . <p> " What is it with you lawyers ? " Bonnie asked , watching him resume his search for the wayward joint . " How come you 're the only people who smoke dope anymore ? " <p> " Our work is very taxing , " he said . <p> " Psh . Whose is n't ? " <p> " It 's a question of degree . There 's a great deal of money , you know , that rides on our ability to make fine discriminations , draw little lines between their side and our side . Some of these lines , they 're so tiny , so arbitrary , that they 're almost invisible . This causes a lot of strain . You come home , you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let things get a little sloppy , you know ? " <p> Oh , thought Bonnie grimly , I know . <p> " Plus we can generally afford the good shit . " <p> " Oh yeah ? So where is it ? " <p> " Funny . I stuck one in here the other day . I wonder if Kippy might have  --  " <p> " Kip smokes ? " <p> " Sure , like a chimney . Ever since the chemo . " <p> " Whoa , wait ... " <p> " Oh , that was , you know , two or three years ago . We had a scare , but it 's in remission now , and they assure us the prognosis is very ... ah , wait , here we go . " He extracted a fat joint and reached into his pocket for some matches . When it was lit , he blew out a jet of smoke and handed it over to Bonnie , who had fallen silent . <p> " It 's terrible what I 'm doing , " he said after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't know about terrible . Irresponsible , maybe . " <p> " No , I mean talking about Kippy . Married people are n't supposed to talk about their spouses in a revealing way , especially to members of the opposite sex . It 's a violation of any number of unwritten conjugal codes . " <p> " What should married people do ? Walk around feeling bottled up and lonely instead ? " <p> Larry considered the question . " I suppose so he said , and laughed a nervous laugh . <p> It really was good shit . It must have been that , or the late hour , or the unlikely surroundings , or else merely the promiscuous way that such things as germs and laughter travel between people  --  in any event , Bonnie began to laugh a little herself . At least she assumed it was laughter . It had been a while . Was laughter supposed to make her stomach so bitter , her cheeks so streaky and hot ? <p> " Bon ? " Larry was leaning forward again , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forehead . " You okay ? " <p> " I think I 'm pregnant . " <p> It was in the nature of an experiment , saying it aloud , and once the words were out , part of her continued to listen carefully for some kind of explosion , but nothing happened . Absolutely nothing . <p> Larry nodded soberly . " I thought so . " <p> " You thought so ? What kind of crazy thing is that to say ? " <p> " Just a feeling , " he said . " I saw you back there when I first sat down . You looked kind of haughty and impatient , like you were cut off from everything and did n't care . Usually this connotes something medical . " He stubbed out the last of the joint , then closed the ashtray with a snap . " I figured either someone died or else you were pregnant . " <p> " Actually , Larry , you were right on both counts . I 'm pregnant , and someone is going to die . " <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prying , " he said gently , " but I take it the father 's not in the picture ? " <p> " The father ? The father is a hot young turk post-structuralist . <p> The father wo n't even concede that an author is responsible for his own book . What 's he going to make out of this ? <p> " Also , " she added wearily , " he lives in Toronto . With a woman . Maybe two women . It 's not entirely clear . " <p> " Well , that 's a tough situation , " Larry said , and rubbed his jaw . <p> " Yep . " <p> " Is there anything I can do ? " <p> " Do ? " She tried to look out the window , but the glass was fogged with her own breath , and she lacked the energy to wipe it clean . <p> " Sure . You know ... " <p> She wheeled around to face him .

" Her stomach flopped over like a salmon . " Oh , shit , " she wailed , " oh , filthy mother of  --  " <p> " Sometimes just talking , " Larry said gently , soothingly , as he inched closer across the leather seat . " Just letting it out ... " <p> Though she did not herself subscribe to this theory , in truth something did happen to Bonnie as the tears fell : Her head became very heavy and at the same time remarkably light . She could feel it taking off on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while and then slowing , easing itself towards the smooth , solid topography of Larry 's shoulder  --  the surface to which all earthly gravity would consign her . All right , okay : she let it go . And , yes , the sensation was luxurious , damn it , rather like dropping into a wide , silken net . And she deserved it , too . She deserved it for all her hard work , for every paper she had written or graded , every diaper , every omelette , every load of laundry , every aimless night she had passed staring at the crack in the wall above the toaster , wondering how not to fall in . Yes , she had worked hard , very goddamned hard , and now she was due ... well , something , she was certainly due something ... <p> Her head touched Larry 's shoulder . Then , immediately , in its stubborn , cork-like fashion , it bobbed right up again .

" <p> But once she had extricated herself from the car , the wind caught her , whipping around like a shroud , as if to expose  --  or perhaps , she wondered briefly , enfold ?  --  her . Overhead , through the skeletal branches , she could see the cold dear eye of the moon . It was getting late . Parents were beginning to push through the double doors and head for their cars . She could not make out their faces in the darkness , but she recognized them by their good bulky winter coats : Geoff Dahlberg , Lucia Todd-Frazen , Howard Peeler . Alice Orkin and Thea Doyle were hugging goodbye ; Bethany Freitag was leaning into Ginny Stern 's car , hammering out some detail of car pooling ; Arthur Browning was talking into his cellular phone , informing his wife to stick his dinner in the oven , he was on his way . The meeting was over . <p> Bonnie was almost to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gym . For a moment she was tempted to leave it there . <p> But she had always liked that coat , and it had another year or two left in it , and she could not afford another right now . So she turned and headed back to the double doors . <p> The hallway was deserted . Of the forty-odd people who 'd attended the meeting , only Sara Montague , locking up the kitchen for the night , remained . Sara looked tired but content ; apparently the Styrofoam debate had been resolved to her satisfaction . She put her keys back in her shoulder bag and wound her scarf loosely around her neck .

He usually does . " <p> " Oh . Oh , well  --  " <p> " I can open it for you , though . " <p> But when they got the gym @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around with a dry mouth and a sinking heart . No coat was in evidence . <p> " Let 's try the lost and found box , " Sara suggested . <p> The coat was not there either , though she did find one of Petey 's T-shirts , mislaid since early October . She clutched it with both hands as she followed Sara out . This she decided , was what had been due her . Not reward , but punishment ; not escape , but a deepening of her hole . After all , she had been digging it for years ; it would take more than a little hanky-panky with Larry Albeit at this point to vault herself free . <p> " Hey , " Sara said . " Is that it ? " <p> Bonnie blinked . There , just outside the door of Petey 's room , was her coat . It had been folded and draped , with some delicacy , across one of the tiny plastic chairs . There was a rise to the shoulders she had n't noticed before ; in her present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she unfolded the coat , a slip of paper fluttered off and fell to the floor . Bonnie paused ; she was aware of being a little bit stoned at the moment , and also of Sara Montague , keys in hand , holding the door that led to the foyer , watching . Hurriedly , she bent over to retrieve the slip of paper , dirtying the knees of her jeans in the process . <p> The note , written in a mother 's careful hand , read : " Does this belong to Bonnie Saks , Petey 's mom ? If so , please make sure she gets it . " <p> Suddenly a gate rose in Bonnie 's heart , and all its channels flooded at once . She was here , she was known , she was being looked after . Things would be delivered to her . <p> Driving home , through an infinity of green lights , Bonnie gave some thought to the many people in her life who had been irritating her so . She thought of the kids , of Cress , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kip . She thought of Kevin , and even Stanley , that wretched bastard , who were after all to be pitied , she decided , not hated , for their estrangement from what they had wrought . And she thought of the writer of that unsigned note , who could have been any one of the parents at the meeting , tired , harried , earnest , squeezing good works without recompense from their busy schedules . Larry was right : Everyone was trying so hard to avoid the old mistakes  --  of course it made them clumsy , it makes all of us clumsy , she thought , all of us but not all the time . <p> When she got home , she found Cress at the kitchen table , thoughtfully smoking a cigarette . " How were they ? " Bonnie asked . <p> " Monsters . " <p> " Sorry . I tried to call . " <p> " That 's okay . " Cress waved her wrist , dispelling the smoke . " I guess the meeting ran long , huh ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sink . Was any pizza left ? She was famished . <p> Cress stubbed out her cigarette and reached for her bag . <p> " Let me just sit for a minute , okay ? Then I 'll call you a cab . " <p> " Okay , cool . " <p> So they sat there a while . Cress put down her bag and lit another cigarette , pausing every so often to tap the ashes into a teacup , and whatever obsessions were running through her head , she chose to retain there . Bonnie , too tired to shrug out of her coat , allowed her eyes to fall closed . She was not thinking about the long evening she had just passed , or the dishes still to be done , the lunches still to be made . She was thinking only of this moment right now , this space that did not demand to be filled because it was not in fact vacant , but merely hanging , suspended in time 's web , between past and future , in a state of pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final analysis she was a very capable person , capable of more , oh , much more than she could possibly envision , perhaps even capable of being happy ... <p> Then Cress yawned . " Can I go now ? " <p> And Bonnie , her eyes still closed , purse clutched to her stomach , thought clearly and without bitterness , This is going to cost me , too . <p>
