Should We Worry ? <p> Environmental issues such as global warming , acid rain , and ozone depletion have captured public attention recently . Concern about such issues has lead many to call for far-reaching solutions . How serious are these threats to the environment ? In the article below , Dr. S. Fred Singer discusses the science behind the headline-making environmental scares . The article is based on a speech given at CR 's symposium on " Science and Regulation . " ( See " Science Behind Recent Regulations Questioned , " CR , July 1991. ) - Ed . <p> What I would like to do is to look at the scientific evidence that underlies some of the hyperactivity that now exists in the global warming and ozone depletion issues . Global Warming <p> Global warming is an issue that has been around for about 100 years . It was first discussed by the Swedish chemist Arrenius , and brought back to life , so to speak , just three years ago by NASA scientist Jim Hansen , who said he was 99% sure that the greenhouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global temperature record of the past 100 years ( put together by Jim Hansen ) . I should say stitched together because it relies on stations all over the earth , many of them in the northern hemisphere , but very few in the southern hemisphere . You see very clearly that over the last 100 years , from 1880 to the 1980s , there has been a temperature increase , very small to be sure , but a temperature increase nevertheless of about half a degree centigrade . <p> If you look at this curve in more detail , you will see that the real increase occurred before 1940 , before there was any real generation of carbon dioxide by human activities ; that there was , between 1940 and 1975 , a decrease in global temperature ; and that between 1975 and 1980 , the temperature suddenly increased . If we had started our temperature record in 1940 , one would say that over the last 50 years there has been no real change , no trend in global temperature , either up or down . <p> We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " natural fluctuations . " But if you ascribe the decrease between 1940 and 1975 to natural fluctuations , as many enthusiasts of global warming do , then why do they ascribe the increase before 1940 to the greenhouse effect ? <p> We have to say-and this holds true for many geophysical data-that the results depend very much on the time interval over which you take your measurements . I am often asked in these presentations : " Dr. Singer , is the climate getting warmer or colder ? " And my answer , generally , is " yes . " It really depends on when you start and when you stop . <p> The predictions for the future are , of course , the worrisome things that people tend to quote . Table 2 shows what they look like . The mean of all of the models is about 0.3 degrees per decade-a huge increase that you would not be able to miss . And when you ask the modelers : " Well , why have n't we seen it yet ? " they will say : " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . " Well , I am willing to take a bet that by the year 2000 we will not be where the calculations indicate we should be . <p> For some reason , the climate record , imperfect as it is , does not agree with the models . Now what does that mean ? Does that mean that people who are modeling do n't know their business ? Are they fools ? Are they worse than fools ? <p> It does n't mean that at all . It means that the models are not complete . They do not include everything that is going on in the atmosphere . And to make the point strongly , an article in the May issue of Nature points to a new observation which is very important . It is a kind of negative feedback that takes place in the atmosphere due to water vapor . And this negative feedback is not taken into account in the models that are currently used . I suspect there are other feedbacks that are not taken into account . <p> In fact , the models are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with water vapor , and with ocean currents . And all of these are necessary in order to be able to simulate the major processes that take place in the atmosphere . <p> To sum up , the current models that predict a huge global warming in the next century are not validated by the actual observations . Therefore , one should conclude that the models can not be relied on at this stage . <p> I am an optimist . I think the models will improve as we learn more about the atmosphere , as we have better observations . I also believe that the models will eventually predict increases that are quite small , not threatening ; but , nevertheless , there should be some small increase in temperature in the next century due to the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere . <p> It is true that the 1980s were the hottest years globally . During the 1980s itself , however , we do not see an upward trend , and that has been now verified by satellite data . For the first time we now have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available-much better than any surface observations . And these data show no discernible upward trend during the 1980s . I would predict they will not show a discernible trend during the 1990s-certainly , much less than the models predict . <p> Temperature data for the United States are the best available ; they were taken with comparable types of thermometers and are well-corrected for what is called the urban heat island effect , that is , the warming that occurs in urban areas just because there is a large population . ( You all know that the cities tend to be warmer than the countryside . Many of the observing stations are just at the edge of cities and airports , and are now subject to a warming that has nothing to do with the climate , but has a lot to do with the growth of cities . ) <p> This U.S. record , published by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , the weather bureau agency , shows a strong increase before 1940 , but no increase after that . In other words , in the United States the warmest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1980s . <p> One more point which is very important : The U.S. data are of good enough quality that we can plot separate trends not only of average temperatures , but also daytime and nighttime temperatures . I have to warn you here that the use of average temperatures hides a great deal of information , so those who are experienced in dealing with these statistics always ask : " What does the average mean ? " <p> The data clearly show that , where there is a warming trend , it is mainly at night . This is important because it has a real impact on agriculture . It means fewer frosts and a longer growing season . These are the features that are generally thought to be beneficial for agriculture , and therefore agriculturists , by and large , think that a modest warming is not a bad thing . In fact , the increased carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) in the atmosphere is already producing an increase in the growth rate of many plants . After all , C02 is plant food . That 's what plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more curve about climate ( table 3 ) . This one is based not on temperature measurements with thermometers , but on indirect measurements , and shows the climate during the past million years and during the past 1,000 years . These are indirect measurements , but they are quite reliable . <p> These data , presented by the British Meteorological Office , show ice ages coming around every 100,000 years , lasting for about 100,000 years , separated by warm periods , which we call " interglacials , " lasting about 10,000 years . <p> We have had about 17 of these ice age cycles in the last 2 million years . There is every expectation that these cycles of ice ages will continue . There is no reason why they should stop now . <p> We are right now in an interglacial , between ice ages . The last ice age stopped about 10,800 years ago . During the last ice age , there were glaciers in southern Britain ; there were also glaciers in Wisconsin , in Massachusetts , and northern Ohio . I will remind you that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The warming period has now lasted 10,800 years . And I mentioned earlier that the average length of an interglacial is 10,000 years . You can draw your own conclusions as to when the next ice age might be coming . It is probably not too far away . <p> In the last 1,000 years , you see large natural fluctuations of climate based on observations of crops and ice coverage . In the 1100s , we see the " medieval climate optimum , " when the Vikings settled Greenland . Greenland was actually green at the time . This was followed by what is called the " little ice age , " which was particularly pronounced in the 1700s . The Thames river in England used to freeze over several times during the winter . It does n't do that anymore . <p> The recovery from the little ice age started around 1850 . That may be the reason for the recent temperature increase up to 1940 . <p> All this emphasizes the fact that the data do not accord with what the greenhouse theory would predict , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not as yet see large , steady increases that should come about according to the theory , and we therefore think the theory should not be relied on for major policy decisions . That is our scientific conclusion . Ozone Depletion <p> Let me now turn to another subject : ozone depletion . Data over the last 30 years or so show large semi-annual fluctuations of about 40% , peak to peak , taking place in a matter of a few months . There are also huge natural fluctuations in the atmospheric ozone related to weather . <p> Now what we have to do is to see whether there is a small trend produced by human activities among these natural fluctuations . And you do n't have to be an atmospheric scientist , or even an expert in statistics , to know that it is difficult to extract reliable information about steady trends when you have large , natural fluctuations that are not very predictable . <p> Let me show you what these fluctuations look like on a longer time scale . Table 4 compares ozone levels with the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ozone data from ground observations only for the past 30 to 35 years . The best ozone data come from northern temperate and high latitudes . You will see that the ozone varies about as much as the sun spot cycle ( which lasts 11 years ) varies . When the sun spots are high , you 've got a lot of ozone . When the sun spots are a minimum , you have an ozone minimum . <p> But the important thing to notice is that each sun spot cycle is different . And the relationship between the ozone and the sun spots is not unique . Now with these large fluctuations , on the order of 3% to 4% in the sun spot cycle , how can one extract a trend which is only as small as a tenth of a percent per year ? It is , I would say , practically impossible . <p> Nevertheless , we were told about three years ago that there is such a trend . And , in April of this year , William Reilly , the administrator of the Environmental Protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that global ozone is declining twice as fast as predicted . He said he was very astounded by this stunning result . Well , as I would like to show you , it is based simply on a misinterpretation of the data , nothing more than that . <p> The EPA announcement was based on the first ever set of data taken from satellites . Table 5 shows the data obtained by the experimenters at the Goddard Space Flight Center of NASA . They start in 1979 and go to 1990 . The sun spot minimum was in 1986 . The experimenters , in publishing this work , state that there is a decreasing trend of 0.47% per year before 1986 , and an increasing trend after the solar minimum , after 1986 . <p> What the EPA did with the same data was to draw a straight line through it and call it " a trend . " You can not really conclude that there is a downward trend based on only 11 years ' worth of data . That is only one solar cycle . You have to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure that the result does not depend on when you start your observations or when you stop . ( This is a common problem in dealing with geophysical data . ) Conclusion <p> I have tried to give you a view here of actual data , so that you can see what some of the earth-shaking discussions are based on these days when people worry about the global environment . In fact , I have concluded that global environmental issues have now become the plaything of international lawyers , and they are very upset because science is now getting in the way . Scientists keep coming back and saying , " Well , maybe . We are not sure . Maybe this is n't happening . " It must be very upsetting to these lawyers because here they are trying to negotiate these wonderful international treaties , and the science is so shaky . And maybe the scientific base will even slip away . <p> The reason I bring all of this up is because the tendency to misuse science , or to ignore it , is very strong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There , the government had funded a 10-year study , at a cost of more than half a billion dollars , involving 3,000 scientists . These scientists finally came up with a conclusion that it is not a big deal , that the damage produced by acid rain is relatively minor . <p> A writer in Science magazine , who happens to feel differently , gave it all away because she said that the scientific conclusions of this study may be alright , but the study is not " policy relevant . " Now what does that mean ? Not policy relevant ? It simply means that the environmental activists in the Congress and elsewhere did n't like the conclusions . So they simply labeled the study " policy irrelevant , " and ignored it . <p> We are faced now with a situation where an acid rain law was passed in 1990 which is basically , as I 've called it , a billion dollar solution to a million dollar problem . This sort of thing , of course , is very hard on pocketbooks . Consumers are going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well for the policy discussions of global warming where the stakes are very much higher , and where the costs are very much greater . Consumers had better watch their pocketbooks . <p> CHART:Table 1:Global Temperatures : The Past 100 years. /NOTE : Zero line shows the average temperature for the years 1951-1980/SOURCE:Dr . James E.
