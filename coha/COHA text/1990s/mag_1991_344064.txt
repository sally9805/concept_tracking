Speaking in New York last month , newly elected Russian Federation president Boris Yeltsin angrily cited an example of the kind of " exploitation " he would not allow : a middleman who bought meat in Moscow and sold it as shashlik in a city less than a hundred miles away for a big markup . Meeting Yeltsin immediately after , S. Frederick Starr , president of Oberlin College in Ohio and a Sovietologist , suggested that instead of putting the dealer out of action , the Russian leader ought to encourage five more hustlers to go into the business . That way more shashlik would be distributed while competition slashed the price . Yeltsin 's face lit up . " Of course you 're right , " he replied , in a **33;10829;TOOLONG tone . <P> That so forceful an advocate of private enterprise as Yeltsin should need instruction in so basic a point underscores the most troublesome question facing the Soviet Union today . It will hover in the background at next week 's Group of Seven summit in London , when Mikhail Gorbachev asks leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and submits to sharp questioning about what kind of reforms he plans to make any aid effective . But the problem goes much deeper than the details of this or that economic plan . It is nothing less than a question of national character : Can the Soviets create the political culture  --  the atmosphere and habits of thought  --  that would make it possible to convert their country into a free-market democracy ? <P> The Soviet Union has virtually no experience with anything resembling such a society ; at times the reformers trying to create one seem to have only a vague idea of what it would look and feel like . Worse still , their efforts run counter to many traditions inculcated by Russian history ; not just the 70 years of communist attempts to create a New Soviet Man , but the centuries of czarist oppression and frequent isolation from outside thought before 1917 . Even optimistic experts  --  and there are some , both Western and Soviet !  --  think creation of the requisite political culture will take decades , perhaps generations , with innumerable opportunities for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least seems to be under way . Last week some of the country 's most prominent advocates of change put together a Democratic Reform Movement , intended to become a unified and permanent opposition to the Communist Party , or at least its hard-line faction . Organizers include former Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze ; Alexander Yakovlev , an adviser to President Mikhail Gorbachev who is sometimes called the " architect of perestroika " ; and Mayors Gavril Popov of Moscow and Anatoli Sobchak of Leningrad .
