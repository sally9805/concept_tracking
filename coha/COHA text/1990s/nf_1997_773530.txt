txt // abilities to self-soothe strong , potentially disruptive emotional states ( Dunn , 1977 ) , focus attention , and organize themselves for coordinated action in the service of some goal . The Challenge in Finding Linkages Between Family and the Peer Worlds : The Development of " Emotional Intelligence " It is now well-known that the ability to interact successfully with peers and to form lasting peer relationships are important developmental tasks . Children who fail at these tasks , who are rejected by their peers , and especially those who are unable to make friends , are at risk for a number of later problems ( Parker &; Asher , 1987 ) . The peer context presents new opportunities and formidable challenges to children . Interacting with peers provides opportunities to learn about more egalitarian relationships than parent ? child relationships ; to form friendships with agemates , negotiate conflicts , engage in cooperative and competitive activities , and learn appropriate limits for aggressive impulses . It provides opportunities for learning that friends can be sources of great fun and adventure as well as comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to obtain this kind of comfort in times of stress from their friends . For example , Kramer and Gottman ( 1992 ) found that the quality of young friendships among 3-year-olds were the best predictor of adjustment to becoming a sibling . On the other hand , children are typically less supportive than caregivers when their peers fail at these tasks . In our research , the quality of the child 's peer relationships forms our most important class of child outcome measures . A major goal of the research we undertook was to predict peer social relations in middle childhood from variables descriptive of the family 's emotional life in preschool . We should explain what the theoretical challenge here is in predicting peer social relations across these two major developmental periods , from preschool to middle childhood . Major changes occur in peer relations in middle childhood . Children become aware of a much wider social network than the dyad . In preschool , children are rarely capable of sustaining play with more than one other child ( see for example , Corsaro , 1979 , 1981 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of peer norms for social acceptance , and teasing and avoiding embarrassment suddenly emerge ( see Gottman &; Parker , 1986 ) . Children become aware of clique structures , and of influence patterns as well as social acceptance . In middle childhood , some of the correlates of peer acceptance and rejection change dramatically , particularly with respect to the expression of emotion . One of the most interesting changes is that the socially competent response to a number of salient social situations such as peer entry and teasing is to be a good observer , somewhat wary , but basically to be cool and emotionally unflappable . The child in middle childhood being teased needs to act as if he or she had undergone an emotion-ectomy , and , indeed a major concern of children in this developmental period is avoiding embarrassment ( see Fine , 1987 ; Gottman &; // Parker , 1986 ) . Thus we can see that the basic elements and skills a child learns through emotion coaching ( labeling , expressing one 's feelings , and talking about one 's feelings ) become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they were to be simply transferred by the child from the home to the school . Thus , we think that the basic model linking emotion coaching in preschool to peer relations in middle childhood can not be a simple isomorphic transfer of social skills model . Instead , it becomes necessary to identify a mechanism operative in the preschool period that makes it possible for the child to learn something in the preschool period that underlies the development of appropriate social skills across this major developmental shift in what constitutes social competence with peers . Thus , there is a major challenge in being able to make linkages from the family 's affective world to the child 's peer world . The challenge is that , as the child develops , many of the child 's peer social competencies become precisely the opposite of what children specifically learn in emotion coaching with parents . Even in the preschool period , entry into a peer group is successful to the extent that children do not call attention to themselves and their feelings , but instead watch the peer group , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do what they are doing , waiting to be invited in . These skills of observing , waiting , watching , and not expressing one 's emotions and discussing them are even more important in middle childhood , when teasing becomes central . Any theory we develop has to contend with the problem that the specific skills children learn in emotion-coaching interactions with parents are precisely the wrong skills for succeeding with peers , and this is even more the case in middle childhood . Hence we propose that a social learning or modeling theory of the development of social competence will not do . It is doomed to failure . What do we offer as an alternative ? We suggest that instead of a social skills theory for making developmental predictions and linkages from the family to the child peer system , a set of general abilities underlie the development of social and emotional competence with peers , and that these abilities form the basis of what Salovey and Mayer ( 1990 ) called emotional intelligence . While Salovey and Mayer 's idea of emotional intelligence is a very long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making these predictions would be much simpler , it would be the child 's ability to regulate emotions and to self-soothe and focus attention during salient emotionally trying peer situations . We expect that we will observe that the child 's peer social competence will hold primarily in the inhibition of negative affect ( Guralnick , 1981 ) , particularly aggression , whining , oppositional behavior , fighting requiring parental intervention , sadness , and anxiety with peers . Being teased in middle childhood is the ultimate proving ground for the child 's ability to inhibit negative affect . Children 's peer social competencies include the ability to resolve conflict , to find a sustained common ground play activity , and to empathize with a peer in distress ( e.g. , see Asher &; Coic , 1990 ; Berndt &; Ladd , 1989 ; Eisenberg &; Strayer , 1987 ; Gottman , 1983 ; Gottman &; Parker , 1986 ; Shantz &; llartup , 1992 ) . // To see how these very basic skills of emotion regulation might operate and underlie the more complex social skills that have been described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's peer social skills at age 5 , in which most of the child 's interaction occurs in dyads . In one transcript of a play session in our research , two 4-year-olds got into a conflict in which the boy wanted to play Superman and the girl wanted to play house . After shouting their wishes back and forth a few times , he calmed down and suggested that they pretend this was Superman 's house , she had also calmed down and thought this was a great idea , and their compromise resulted in an enjoyable pretend play session for both children . It takes a lot of skill to be able to self-soothe in this situation and to both suggest and to accept a creative compromise . What is different about children who can and can not do this ? We think there is a fundamental set of abilities that have to do with understanding one 's own emotions , being able to regulate them , being able to soothe one 's self physiologically , focus attention , listen to what one 's playmate is saying , being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to engage in social problem solving , or as Asher has suggested , relating one 's goals to one 's strategies . These are the skills children learn with emotion-coaching parents , but they are not applied isomorphically to the peer world . They involve the child knowing something about the world of emotion , her own as well as others . This knowledge arises only out of emotional connection being important in the home . Hence , in middle childhood , we suggest that the child who has been emotion coached by parents has developed a general set of skills that appear to have nothing to do with expressing and understanding one 's own feelings . However , they have to do with the ability to inhibit negative affect , with being able to selfsoothe , with being able to focus attention ( including social attention ) and with being able to regulate one 's own emotions . In middle childhood these abilities are manifest by inhibiting displays of distress and inhibiting aggression when teased and instead acting emotionally unflappable , and in being able to enter an ongoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lumbering bravado of the socially rejected child . We think that it will eventually turn out that these emotion regulation abilities are , to some extent , temperamental , but that , to a greater extent , we think that they are shaped by parents beginning in infancy ( see Appendix 5.1 ) . This shaping begins in parents ' ability to deal with an infant 's distress with affection and comfort ( Dunn , 1977 ) and continues into the face-to-face play with the infant in the first year of life ( Gianino &; Tronick , 1988 ; Stem , 1985 ) . This thinking is consistent with many current theorists writing about social and emotional development in infancy and the role of face-to-face interaction of infants and parents , work we review in this chapter . Hence , we predict that there will be pathways from our meta-emotion variables to the child 's physiological responses during emotion-arousing situations in the laboratory parent ? child interaction , emotioneliciting films ) . // Cognitive and Emotional Development May Be Linked Other researchers have suggested that linkages exist between social and cognitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that emotion regulation abilities in children are fundamental to the development of cognitive competencies in school . The Emotion Regulation Theory places attentional processes as the central mediator between emotional regulation and the development of cognitive competence . The vagal tone variables have been found to underlie the deployment of attention . The major link between emotional and cognitive abilities may be found in the domain of attention deployment , which we see as one component of emotion regulation ( for a review , see Wilson &; Gottman , 1995 ) . There is evidence that attentional processes mediate between risk and psychopathology in children ( Kellam , 1994 ) . We know that attentional processes organize experiences from the earliest moments of life . They play a central role in the establishment of physiological homeostasis and emotion regulation abilities ( Rothbart &; Derryberry , 1981 ) . It is quite probable that attentional abilities form a necessary precondition for much subsequent cognitive and social advancement . For example , a major developmental shift that occurs at around 9 months of age is the infant 's ability to share attention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergence of social referencing ( e.g. , see Stern , 1977 ; Walden , 1991 ) . Attentional processes may also affect important sources of socialization and support for infants . This may occur in the caregiver ? infant and peer systems as well as academic settings later in life . We expect that an emotion-coaching meta-emotion structure will predict the development of superior cognitive skills of the child ( through superior vagal tone and greater ability to focus attention ) . Because we think that this superior cognitive performance is mediated by the parents ' meta-emotion structure , we predict that the relationship between the parents ' meta-emotion structure and the child 's achievement at age 8 would hold over and above preschool measures of intelligence . Thus , we predict that two preschool children of equal intelligence will differ , in part , in their ultimate achievement in school as a function of the parents ' meta-emotion structure . In this chapter , we examine the relationship between the parents ' meta-emotion when the child is of preschool age and the child 's subsequent academic achievement at age 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotion-regulation abilities will relate to similar abilities in the child . We expect this emotion-coaching meta-emotion structure to be related to more positive and less negative parent ? child interaction . We assume that more positive and less negative parent ? child interaction will be reflected in lower levels of child stress and superior functioning of the parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system . These will be displayed by the child 's physiology . In this chapter we briefly review the selection of two indices of the // child 's physiology : ( a ) a higher child basal vagal tone , and ( b ) a better ability to suppress vagal tone when required , which are indices of the tonus of the parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system ( Izard , Porges , Simons , &; Haynes , 1991 ; Porges , 1984 ) . Later we see that these indices are related to other indices of lower general physiological arousal such as a lower baseline heart rate and lower skin conductance levels . The sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system also plays a role in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotion-coaching meta-emotion structure , we expect to find in the children lower levels of stress-related hormones ( both catecholamines and cortisol ) in a 24-hour urine sample . We also expect that the meta-emotion variables , as well as the physiological variables , will be related to child physical health . We posit that through the mechanism of lower levels of physiological stress in the child , the child will be better at focusing attention and self-soothing . Toward this end , we examine the child 's performance on the Stroop Interference Test , which assesses attentional competence and the ability to inhibit impulsive responses ( e.g. , see Lufi , Cohen , &; Parish , 1990 ) and attention deficit disorder ( e.g. , see Grodzinsky &; Diamond , 1992 ) . We measure the child 's emotion regulation ability with a questionnaire that asks parents to tell us how much they have to " down-regulate " the child 's emotions , that is how much the child is out of control . We propose that an emotion-coaching meta-emotion structure will also buffer the child against the development of child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parents ' meta-emotions with the longitudinal development of child behavior problems on measures such as the Child Behavior Checklist ( Achenbach &; Edelbrock , 1983 , 1986 ) . We think that part of the result of a parental emotion-coaching meta-emotion structure is a superior ability in the regulation of emotion by parents in the service of the management of stress ( Fox , 1989 ) . Because of the connection between the management and stress and physical health ( e.g. , see Barnett &; Marshall , 1993 ) , we also expect this emotion-regulation ability to be reflected longitudinally in higher parental physical health . We recognize that our correlational studies can not test the theory we have proposed . However , we expect the correlational data to provide some insight into the potential validity of this theory and to suggest some directions for future research . MAKING THE MODEL SPECIFIC To return to our model , we can now be far more specific , and we have several variables for each of our concepts . For the meta-emotion structure we select from the meta-emotion variables we describe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds of variables : Hypothesis 1 suggests variables from the // Cowans ' Coding System that make up the Warmth construct ( warmth and cowarmth ) , and from the Kahen systems , the variables that make up Emotional Engagement construct ; Hypothesis 2 suggests measuring Derogation from the KEACS system using criticism , intrusiveness , and mockery . For the child physiology construct we have two parasympathetic variables ? basal vagal tone and the suppression of vagal tone . For the sympathetic nervous system , we have the urinary secretion of the catecholamines , and the **37;121;TOOLONG axis ' secretion of cortisol . For the child emotion regulation construct we designed the Katz ? Gottman measure of how much the parents must emotionally down-regulate the child . The child outcomes we have selected are described in the section preceding chapter 12 ; they include , child ? peer relations as measured by teacher and parent ratings and by observations of peer play with a best friend ( which gives a nearly optimal profile ) , child negative affectivity ( which includes child behavior problem ratings at age 8 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achievement at age 8 . SUMMARY OF EMOTION REGULATION THEORY We have proposed a model that what develops that is central to the prediction of child outcomes , particularly related to child peer relations , is the child 's regulatory physiology and the child 's ability to inhibit negative affect ( negative emotional down regulation ) . We have suggested that parental interaction with children that is emotion-coaching , Warm , non-Derogatory , and Scaffolding/Praising , are the logical candidates through which children acquire the ability to suppress vagal tone when engaging with the world cognitively or affectively by selfsoothing , inhibiting negative affect and focusing attention . In effect , we suggest that parents are helping children develop these regulatory skills by a particular kind of interaction with their children during emotional moments . In Fig. 5.1 , there are four domains of variables in the model for predicting peer social competence in middle childhood , as well as other developmental outcomes ( cognitive , affective , and physical health ) . These are : ( a ) emotional awareness and emotion-coaching , ( b ) three parenting variables , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ c ) two child regulatory physiology variables , basal vagal tone and the ability to suppress vagal tone , and ( d ) negative emotion down regulation . Appendix 5.1 How Specifically Might Meta-Emotion and Parenting Affect a Child 's Development ? In this section we attempt to fill out the reasoning for the pathways described in Fig. 5.1 . We put together a theory that reflects our thinking about how the emotional life of a family can affect the child 's emotional development . Thus , although our discussion includes warmth , coldness , structuring , discipline , and maturity demands , in a climate of respect and responsiveness , we think these qualities of parenting form the backdrop for the family 's meta-emotion structure and that , taken together these concepts form an operational definition of what Ginott was talking about . Tronick 's ( Gianino &; Tronick , 1988 ) mutual regulation model of face-to-face play between mothers and infants suggests that an infant needs to regulate her level of physiological arousal so that she is psychologically available for play . Fox ( 1989 ) showed that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distraction and other means for self-soothing . Fox has discovered that the physiological precursor of an infant 's eventual exploration of a novel stimulus or approach to a stranger is baseline vagal tone at 6 months . We suggest that the most fundamental part of emotion regulation abilities has to do with the deployment of attention , and that through these skills both a child 's cognitive and social-emotional development will be affected . There is evidence that attentional processes mediate between risk and psychopathology in children . Kellam ( 1994 ) found that problems in concentration played a central role in the development of shy and aggressive behavior and poor achievement in first-grade boys and girls . The ability to regulate attention is a part of the more general abilities in emotion regulation that children develop . We think that parenting plays a central role in the child 's developing emotion regulation abilities . EMOTIONAL REGULATION AND EARLY INFANT-CAREGIVER INTERACTIONS Beginning in the first months of life , infants and their caregivers engage in cycles of attention and withdrawal ( Brazelton , Koslowski , &; Main , 1974 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involve a great deal of joy , play , and positive affect for most parents ; they are largely emotional exchanges . They form a basis for the development of affectional bonds ( Cohn &; Tronick , 1989 ; Tronick &; Gianino , 1986 ) . These interactions are also characterized by reciprocal gazes , vocalizations , facial expressions , and body gestures that proceed in a turn-taking manner . The caregiver ? infant relationship is an important and supportive setting for learning a number skills necessary for establishing and maintaining effective social engagement with others , such as conversations and play . These skills include turn-taking , the regulation of levels of stimulation during engagement , and learning about the emotions of self and others . Turn-Taking An important skill needed for social interactions is turn-taking . During early interactions with their infants , caregivers typically watch for signals , such as eye contact or smiles , before engaging their infants ( Brazelton , Koslowski , &; Main , 1974 ) . Caregivers then direct some behavior toward their infants , such as smiles , vocalizations , or physical play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pauses in the infant 's behaviors serve as a signal for the onset of additional caregiver behaviors . The infant 's cycles of attention and inattention form the basis for these judgments . Sensitive caregivers use these states to draw infants into periods of engagement that become more mutually regulated as the weeks pass . Caregivers also make adjustments in these interactions based on individual differences in the reactivity , tolerance for stimulation , and attentiveness of their infants . For example , mothers of Down syndrome infants talk more rapidly when interacting with their infants ( Buckhalt , Rutherford , &; Goldberg , 1978 ) . Down syndrome infants , on the other hand , vocalize more randomly and leave shorter pauses between their vocalizations ( Jones , 1977 , 1980 ) . These mothers may be adjusting their responses to fit into the spaces provided by their infants . As infants mature , parental responsibility for maintaining states of engagement decreases and infants begin to take a more active role in regulating interactions . Mutual Regulation Infants have different tolerance levels for excitement during interactions . When they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in what Tronick ( 1989 ) called , " self-directed " regulatory behaviors . These behavit'irM tn ? // elude looking away , sucking the thumb , or looking at the hands and lower the level of stimulation and consequently their arousal lowers as well . They also serve as signals to caregivers that they need to reduce their level of stimulation and wait until the infant is ready to re-engage . Infants use " other-directed regulatory behaviors " , such as smiles or eye contact , to signal their renewed desire to interact ( Tronick , 1989 ) . Successful experiences with regulating sources of stimulation help infants feel a sense of control over their arousal levels in social situations . In normal caregiver ? infant interactions , about 30% of the time is spent in this kind of coordinated interaction ( Tronick , 1989 ) . Transitions from coordinated to miscoordinated states and back again are frequent events . In fact , these experiences may help to build stress tolerance in infants ; they may learn to maintain interactions despite moments of stress . Tronick ( 1989 ) suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from negative affect challenge infants to expand and elaborate their regulatory repertoires . Although some conflictual or miscoordinated interactions occur in all infant ? caregiver dyads , a high proportion may adversely influence the development of effective regulatory patterns . Expectations , Attention , and Regulatory Patterns Infants who habitually experience miscoordinated states , such as infants with unresponsive caregivers , exhibit difficulties in their regulatory patterns . Researchers have investigated the effects of chronic miscoordinated states by using the " still-face " paradigm ( Cohn &; Tronick , 1983 ) . Mothers are asked to maintain a frozen yet neutral expression while seated in front of their infants . Most infants initially react to this situation by signaling that they want mother to interact with them . When these attempts fail , infants express distress followed by self-directed regulatory behavior . Infants build up expectancies about the consequences of their behavior in these situations . Thus , previous experiences with success or failure at repairing miscoordinated states influence the regulatory behavior of infants . Infants who have experienced a high degree of success are more likely to use other-directed regulatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tronick , 1988 ) . Infants in chronically miscoordinated dyads , such as depressed mothers and their infants , repeatedly engage in self-directed regulatory behavior . Normal interaction patterns are disrupted and infants employ self-regulatory behaviors in an automatic , inflexible , and indiscriminate way . Because this pattern is used defensively in anticipation of negative affect , it may result in a passive , " depressive " pattern of responding . This atypical pattern has been dramatically demonstrated by Field , Healy , Goldstein , and Perry ( 1988 ) , who reported that the regulatory patterns and interaction style of infants of depressed mothers did not vary with the responsiveness of different social partners . The regulation of negative // affect becomes the infant 's primary goal . In extreme cases , the result may be disengagement from people and objects because these take too much regulatory capacity ( Field , Healy , &; LeBlanc , 1989 ; Tronick , 1980 ; Tronick &; Field , 1986 ) . Hence , parental psychopathology influences sensitivity to infant signals . The presence of familial stressors , such as marital discord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warner , &; Weissman , 1990 ) . Elizabeth Fivaz-Depeursinge ( personal communication , 1991 ) reported that unhappily married couples consistently overstimulated their infants in triadic play situations ( i.e. , mother , father , and infant ) . When their infants became distressed , these parents also failed to appropriately soothe them . Consequently , these infants were less able to organize their gaze in the play situation and looked away from their parents more than infants of happily married parents . Social interactions present many regulatory challenges for infants . Patterns of attention play a central role in these interactions . Through the use of attention deployment strategies , infants are able to regulate their own level of arousal . These strategies also serve a communicative function . They tell caregivers that they need to adjust the level of their stimulation . The sensitivity and responsiveness of caregivers to these signals is a key element in the infant 's ability to acquire effective regulatory patterns . Social interactions also provide infants with opportunities for learning about the emotions of self and others . Early Socialization of Emotional Expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imitation of infant affective expressions by their caregivers . An infant 's ability to benefit from these experiences is grounded in the ability to attend selectively to these signals . Parental modeling appears to be selective for the socialization of the more positive emotions ( Malatesta &; Haviland , 1982 ) . In normal interactions , mothers model the more positive affects of their infants . This modeling is associated with increases in positive affect in dyadic interactions over time . In a recent study , Malatesta and her colleagues ( Malatesta-Magai , 1991 ; Malatesta , Culver , Tesman , &; Shepard , 1989 ) examined the modeling behavior of mothers of full-term and preterm infants . Mothers of full-term infants modeled most of the affective behaviors of their infants except for pain expressions ( Malatesta-Magai , 1991 ) . Mothers of preterm infants , on the other hand , revealed a different more selective pattern . They showed higher levels of modeling interest but were more likely to ignore infant anger , sadness , and surprise . Maletesta noted that preterm infants are more easily overstimulated , more irritable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignore anger and sadness may he the mother 's way of reducing the angry , irritable behavior of these infants . The avoidance of sadness may be due to the perceived frailty of these infants . By ignoring the less acceptable affective expressions of their infants , mothers may he attempting to reduce these behaviors . However this technique appears to be // ineffective in some cases . At 22 months , children who had experienced maternal ignoring of sadness and anger displayed more sadness and anger during a reunion after maternal separation than children whose mothers did not ignore these expressions . By responding to some emotions and not others , caregivers attempt to socialize the affective expressions of their infants . Infants may learn to express emotions within a certain range of acceptable affective expressions because of these experiences . Conversely , certain emotions , especially anger and sadness , may be less malleable . These emotions serve as powerful signals that something needs to be changed . Not responding to these signals over a period of time may be indicative of less sensitive caregiving . Sharing States of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their experiences to intentionally sharing them with others . Parents also seem aware of this shift in their infant 's abilities and increasingly address the subjective experiences of their infants ( see Stern , 1985 ) . Intersubjectivity involves the sharing of internal experiences between the self and others . These early experiences include attempts to share attentional focus , intentions , and affective states . Early signs of intersubjectivity can be seen in infants ' responses to attempts to redirect their attention to various objects and events . In the second half of the first year , infants are able to visually follow the line of their mother 's gaze to a particular target ( Scaife &; Bruner , 1975 ) . At about 9 months , they are also able to shift their attention from a pointing hand and follow an imaginary line from the pointing finger to the target with their gaze ( Murphy &; Messer , 1977 ) . Infants visually check their mother 's face during these encounters to confirm that they have correctly identified the target . Infants also begin to use gestures to redirect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At about 9 months , infants point and use other body gestures to communicate their needs and desires . Many of these early attempts to redirect the attention of caregivers involve a desire for an object or event . An infant who spots her bottle on the kitchen counter may point toward the bottle . While doing this , she may also alternate her gaze between her mother and the desired object . This type of " intentional communication " ( Bates , 1979 ) by infants indicates that they understand that internal states can be shared with others . Affective expressions often accompany many of these events . The sharing of affective states is the primary means of communication for preverbal infants . Requests for objects are often accompanied by changes in the infant 's facial expression and/or tone of voice . Infants also learn to differentiate between the positive and negative affective signals of caregivers . As infants gain the ability to move further away from familiar adults , attention to signals from the caregiver provides an important source of emotional regulation . Studies of // social referencing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference their caregiver 's emotional responses in ambiguous situations . Infants then modify their own affective responses and behavior based on these signals ( Klinnert , Emde , Butterfield , &; Campos , 1987 ; Campos &; Sternberg , 1981 ) . The marital satisfaction of fathers strongly influences whether or not infants will socially reference to them ( Dickstein &; Parke , 1988 ) ; infants do not reference unhappily married fathers , but they do reference unhappily married mothers . Emotion regulatory processes such as attention play a central role in the early development of intersubjectivity . In fact , intersubjectivity is a complex problem of shared and coordinated attention between two people . Caregivers and infants use their attentional focus to indicate and verify that they understand each other , to help in communicating their needs and desires , and to share the affective states of the other . The development of intersubjectivity enables children and their caregivers to experience a new level of interrelatedness . Children who experience attentional difficulties , especially in the shifting of attention may miss many of these early experiences of interrelatedness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents watch their infants for signs that indicate their readiness to interact or need to disengage . Parents initially take a dominant role in these interchanges and make appropriate adjustments to aid their infants . As children mature , most parents decrease the level of their own directiveness and expect more from their children . Nevertheless , throughout development , parents continue to play a supportive , helpful role in caregiver ? child interactions . However , when interacting with peers , the responsibility for engaging , repairing , and maintaining social contact shifts to children . They must be alert to opportunities for social engagement with others , attend to cues and feedback , and modify their behavior based on this information . From Object Play to Social Interaction At about 6 months of age , infants begin to spend more time attending to objects in their environment . The ability to shift attention from object to object and from objects to potential social partners is a necessary skill in peer relations . Object play also often mediates early social behavior ; 88% of interactions between infants from 12 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1976 ) . What begins as object play often leads to the discovery of interpersonal contingencies . Difficulties in shifting attentional focus may limit this important avenue for peer contact . In addition , shifts in attentional focus also aid the older child ' . peer interactions . Once a joint activity is established , children still need to moni112 APPENDIX 5.1 : META-EMOTION , PARENTING , AND DEVELOPMENT tor the behavior of their playmate . Monitoring of the play environment also helps children anticipate and prepare for changes in this environment . Children who become engrossed in object play and fail to appropriately monitor the activities of playmates , will miss feedback from peers about their behavior . These children should be less able to maintain their joint activity than children who attend to the cues of others . Not only do these children miss opportunities available in extended social play , but their peers may come to perceive them as unpredictable or even unrewarding play partners . Research in our laboratory indicates that children with high vagal tone are more able to maintain a joint activity with their best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The superior attentional and emotion regulation abilities of these children may be responsible for this association . As children mature and their social interactions increase in complexity , difficulties associated with attentional problems would be expected to compound . One complex but necessary social task is entering into the play activities of others . The ability of children to enter the ongoing activities of others has received much interest over the past ten years . Successful entry serves as a prerequisite for further social interaction . Young children are frequently presented with the need to enter a new playgroup , because interactions episodes between young children typically last less than five minutes ( Corsaro , 1979 , 1981 ) . Entry also appears to be a difficult and potentially stressful task . Dodge , McClaskey , and Feldman ( 1985 ) reported that the entry situation is frequently identified by clinicians and teachers as being especially problematic for children . The play interactions of young children are quite fragile and easily disrupted , therefore , children tend to protect their interactions by discouraging the initial attempts of others to enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entering children must frequently deal with disputes over access to the group and their activities . They must also handle rejection from the group , as more than 50% of all initial attempts fail ( Corsaro , 1979 ) . Research with normally developing children indicates that successful entry is related to the ability to grasp the group 's " frame of reference " ( Putallaz , 1983 ) . Phillips , Shenker , and Revitz ( 1951 ) suggested that the most important task for entering children is one of determining the frame of reference common to the groups ' members and then establishing themselves as somehow sharing in this frame of reference . In general , high-status ( i.e. , popular ) children are more successful at these tasks ( Dodge , Schlundt , Schocken , &; Delugach , 1983 ; Putallaz , 1983 ; Putallaz &; Gottman , 1981 ; Putallaz &; Wasserman , 1989 ) . Thus , at least two tasks are important to successful entry . First , the child must attend to the group 's activities to assess their frame of reference and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child must have strategies for handling initial rejections to their entry requests . These initial experiences are stressful and may generate negative affective responses in the entering child . An inability to calm one 's self after strong affect may lead to less organized and adaptive behavior . Children may act aggressively toward the group // or withdraw completely . Each of these responses will decrease the probability of successful entry . Children with good attentional abilities should be better able to selectively attend to relevant information concerning the group 's current activity . In addition , selective attention provides a number of avenues for the regulation of positive and negative emotion . Therefore , children with good attentional abilities should be better able to calm themselves after rejection and reorganize their behavior to continue this task . In a recent dissertation in our laboratory , Wilson ( 1994 ) studied retarded and normal male children 's behavior during an analogue peer entry situation . In this situation , the other children were the confederates of the experimenter and were following the same script for each child . This permitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child 's latency to respond when the other children asked the entering child for a play object within his reach . The design of this study was also unique . When they were preschoolers , the children had been studied in Dodge ? Coie groups of unacquainted 6-person peers for 10 sessions , and the success of their naturalistic attempts to gain entry into the play of their peers was observed and coded . Subjects were either high or low in their success at gaining entry . Wilson also studied these children in a set of attentional tasks , and she recorded heart rate during these tasks as well as during peer group entry . This was a complex study with many interesting findings . Wilson found that basal vagal tone was predictive of sustained attentional abilities for the retarded subjects only . She found that the subjects ' performance on the cognitive attentional tasks predicted their performance on the social attention measure she used during the analogue entry situation , and it related to success in naturalistic entry . The ability to attend to relevant social cues and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engage in play . The ability to successfully coordinate play is a particularly complex task . Children typically negotiate concerning roles , ownership of toys , and changes in activities . Attending to the affective signals of others and modifying behavior appropriately based on these cues , enables children to maintain their play activity despite periods of disagreement and stress . As children 's ability to communicate with others increases they also begin to use language to regulate their affective states and social relationships . LANGUAGE AND WHAT IT ENTAILS FOR EMOTION REGULATION In this section we discuss how language facilitates children 's emotion regulation abilities . With the development of self-talk , children have at their disposal a new and powerful tool for soothing negative affect during challenging situations . Self - talk can he used to direct one 's attention toward relevant aspects of a problem and // away from irrelevant factors ( i.e. , negative cognitions ) . Vygotsky ( 1962 ) proposed a developmental progression in children 's use of language . Children first use language to establish and maintain contact with others . At about 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking to themselves as they engage in activities . Language begins to provide a new means of solving problems at this point . Vygotsky observed that children tend to talk to themselves at a much higher rate ( almost double ) when confronted with frustrating situations . In the following example a child is getting ready to draw and finds that there is no paper or pencil of the color he needs . The child would try to grasp and to remedy the situation in talking to himself : " Where 's the pencil ? I need a blue pencil . Never mind , I 'll draw with the red one and wet it with water ; it will become dark and look like blue . " ( Vygotsky , 1962 , p. 16 ) At this point the child uses overt speech , but eventually this will no longer be necessary and language will go underground . He or she can then talk to himself as a means of calming down and solving problems more effectively . For example , confronted with an unfamiliar challenging situation , children may tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure things out . Alternately , young children may engage in negative self-talk . As described earlier , negative cognitions about one 's ability may distract children from their primary task and subsequently impede their performance . These negative cognitions may compete for the attentional capacities of these children . At this point in a child 's development , some parents begin to talk to their child about their own internal thoughts and feelings . For example , Fivush ( 1991 ) asked mothers to discuss with their children four specific past events in which their 3-year-old children experienced happiness , sadness , anger , and fear . She found that mothers discussed the emotions of sadness and anger differently with sons and daughters . Conversations about sadness were longer and emphasized the causes of sadness more with daughters than with sons , and mothers were more concerned about comforting their sad daughters than their sad sons . Conversations about anger with sons were longer than with daughters . Daughters were encouraged to resolve anger by reestablishing the damaged relationship and all emotions were placed in more of a social interactional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We believe that this kind of interaction will be important in shaping the child 's abilities to self-regulate using language . Symbolic Representation The ability to symbolically represent internal states such as emotions also provides children with new ways to regulate these states . Preschool children typically bring emotional themes into their fantasy play . Situations that are upsetting can he explored and acted out in fantasy , thus enabling them to understand and // cope with them ( Gottman , 1986 ) . The following episode involves two cross-sex friends aged 4 and 5 . Eric pretends to be a skeleton . The " skeleton " voices Eric 's concern about people not liking him . E : ( Screams ) A skeleton , everyone , a skeleton ! N : I 'm your friend . The dinosaur . E : Oh , hi dinosaur . You know , no one likes me . N : But I like you . I 'm your friend . E : But none of my other friends like me . They do n't like my new suit . They do n't like my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I 'm a dumb dumb . N : I know what . He 's a good skeleton . E : ( yelling ) : I am not a dumb dumb . N : I 'm not calling you a dumb dumb . I 'm calling you a friendly skeleton . ( Gottman , 1986 , p. 160 ) Fantasy play provides a safety valve for expressing fears and other concerns because these feelings belong to the pretend character ( Gottman , 1986 ) . By rehearsing these fantasy scenes the child is able to examine different ways of dealing with the emotions . The parents ' help in teaching a child to label an affective state may enable children to divert their attention from any physiological arousal caused by the state and focus on understanding and dealing with possible causal factors . There is evidence of linkages between the family system and the child ? peer system ( e.g. , Booth , Rose-Krasnor , &; Rubin , 1991 ; Bhavnagri &; Parke , 1991 ; Cassidy , Parker , &; Butkovsky , 1992 ; Cohn , Patterson , &; Christopoulos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Hart , 1992 ; MacDonald &; Parke , 1984 ; Pettit , Harrist , Bates , &; Dodge , 1991 ; Putallaz , Costanzo , &; Smith , 1991 ) . Friends also play an instrumental role in this process by providing an new source of solace and understanding beyond the caregiver system . In the preceding example , Eric 's friend reassures him that he is liked , that he is " a friendly skeleton . " Children who choose to talk about feelings and concerns with friends may have different developmental histories than children who do not . Children who encounter sensitive interactions with caregivers and have been encouraged to express their feelings may be more likely to transfer these skills to the peer realm . The relationship between emotion language and self-control has been investigated experimentally . In a study of normal 5-year-old children , Greenberg , Kusche , and Speltz ( 1991 ) assessed the ability to tolerate frustration and to engage adaptively while waiting to open a gift . The researchers also assessed the quality of the parent ? child attachment relationship by observing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother . Another variable of interest was the child 's ability to identify appropriate emotional reactions to a series of situations related to attachment . This was assessed via a semi-projective task contain116 APPENDIX 5.1 : META-EMOTION , PARENTING , AND DEVELOPMENT ing photographs of events such as a parent leaving on vacation . This variable , labeled emotional openness , was significantly related to the children 's ability to tolerate frustration and to cope adaptively during the waiting period . Emotional openness and the ability to tolerate frustration and to cope adaptively were positively associated with the attachment ratings of these children . Children with more secure attachments were more able to tolerate frustration and cope adaptively . This study supports the hypothesis that the development of emotion-related language skills is related to the ability to tolerate frustrating events . The fact that these variables are also related to the quality of the attachment relationship highlights the role of caregivers in this process . Thus , there is evidence that sensitive and responsive parenting during the preschool period , involves the ability to notice the affective states of children and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Greenberg et al. , 1991 ) . In addition , parents who engage in verbal joint planning , negotiating and anticipatory guidance with their children help them learn more effective ways of dealing with emotions . When caregivers discuss and make plans with their children before stressful events occur such as separations , this gives the children a sense of self-efficacy and enables them to move toward greater autonomy . It also provides a model of ways that they can anticipate and regulate their emotional responses to related stressful events . A coaching parental meta-emotion structure will make sure that these kinds of interactions occur with the child as he or she develops from infancy to the preschool years , when many children can clearly articulate what they are feeling . We suggest that parental attention to the emotional world of children will strongly affect the child 's development of emotion regulation skills , including attentional skills , and self-regulatory skills . We suggest that these skills form the basis of successful child outcomes through their effects on the child 's physiology , and on attentional and emotion regulatory processes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brief Review of Research THE VAGAL " BRAKE " AND THE SYMPATHETIC " ACCELERATOR " The autonomic nervous system controls internal organs such as the heart and glands and has , what may crudely be considered , two largely antagonistic branches , the sympathetic nervous system ( SNS ) and parasympathetic nervous system ( PNS ) . These branches work together to maintain a state of homeostasis inside the body . Although the two systems are not always antagonistic ( e.g. , see Berne &; Levy , 1987 ; on the synergistic effects of the PNS and SNS in myocardial contractility ) , the basic function of the sympathetic branch is to mobilize the body to meet emergency situations , while the parasympathetic 's is to conserve and maintain bodily resources . The activity of the parasympathetic branch usually works to counteract that of the sympathetic . The result is a complex and highly interrelated system of control . The chief nerve of the parasympathetic nervous system is the X-th cranial nerve , the vagus nerve , which , among other things , stimulates digestion and acts as a brake on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid heart rate increases of up to 100 beats per minute ( BPM ) are due to the releasing of this vagal brake . After that , the SNS cuts in and heart rate increases higher than 100 BPM are obtained . The releasing of PNS inhibition can not speed the heart beyond its intrinsic pacemaker rhythm , usually about 110 BPM . High levels of cardiovascular arousal indexed by increased heart rate involve " releasing " the vagal brake and " stepping on " the SNS accelerator . Further increases in cardiac output ( CO ) are obtained by increasing dimensions of myocardial contractility ( roughly how hard the heart contracts ; e.g. , ejection fraction ) , which is mediated mostly by the SNS ( see Berne &; Levy , 1987 ) . // Vagal Tone Under most conditions , the vagus nerve acts tonically on the heart , firing frequently so that the heart beats at a rate below that of the atrial pacemaker cells . So the vagus maintains a basal tonus , called vagal tone . If the vagus is cut or frozen temporarily , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intrinsic rhythm of the heart . Vagal input to the heart is interrupted on a rhythmic basis with each successive respiratory cycle . Heart rate increases during inspiration and decreases during exhalation . This repetitive turning off and on of parasympathetic stimulation to the heart due to respiration is known as respiratory sinus arrhythmia ( RSA ) . When there are greater parasympathetic influences on the heart , larger transient accelerations in heart rate occur after interruptions of vagal influences . This results in greater amplitude of RSA ( Porges , personal communication , 1992 ) . Porges et al . ( 1980 ) developed a time-series algorithm of RSA , which he equated with vagal tone . The analyses attempts to partial out variability in heart rate due to RSA from variability due to other factors such as blood pressure , thermoregulatory processes , and movement . Pharmacological , surgical , and electrical stimulation studies confirm that Porges ' index of vagal tone provides a reliable index of the parasympathetic nervous system 's influence on the heart ( McCabe , Yongue , Porges , &; Ackles , 1984 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Porges , 1986 ; Yongue et al. , 1982 ) . Although there is some controversy about whether computations of vagal tone need to include respiratory measures , there is also evidence that most computations of vagal tone are highly correlated ( Grossman , Van Beek , &; Wientjes , 1990 ) . Our computations of vagal tone do not employ the Porges algorithm but actually compute the area under the curve in the appropriate respiratory ranges of the spectral density function of the interbeat interval time-series . Vagal Tone , Development , and Risk We know that , in general , vagal tone increases monotonically during development and then decreases with old age ( Gellhorn &; Loofbourrow , 1963 ; Larson &; Porges , 1982 ) . The myelination process may account for some of the increase early in development ( Sachis , Armstrong , Becher , &; Bryan , 1982 ) . Vagal tone also appears to index the integrity of the CNS ; high risk neonates ( i.e. , preterm infants ) have significantly lower vagal tone than full-term infants ( Porges , in press ) . Furthermore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of clinical risk ; healthier preterms have higher vagal tone ( Porges , 1983 ) . Vagal tone begins to show moderate long-term stability by the second half of the first year of life ( Fox , 1989 ) . Unfortunately , at this point in time researchers know very little about the factors involved in the stabilization process of vagal tone . It is assumed that maturation of PNS areas are involved in this process ( Porges , personal communication , 1992 ) . We also know that vagal tone decreases when // physical health is compromised and during periods of stress . Recent work by DiPietro , Larson , and Porges ( 1987 ) indicated that at 1 ? 2 days of age , breast-fed infants have higher vagal tone than bottle-fed infants . DiPietro et al . suggested that nutrition ( i.e. colostrum ) may be the key factor in this association , but social experiences during feeding may also be implicated . The breast-feeding experience offers a potentially rich context for social and tactile experiences ( Dunn , 1977 ) . Caregiver responses during the first months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain development because this is a period of rapid neurological growth . The ability to benefit from these early experiences may also be related to the attentional abilities of infants . Heart Rate Variability , Vagal Tone , and Attention Research over the past 20 years has consistently found a strong association between heart rate variability and attentional processes . Lacey ( 1967 ) noted that heart rate decelerates and stabilizes ( periods between beats become more constant ) during periods of attention . Although Lacey did not use heart rate variability as a dependent variable , Porges and Raskin ( 1969 ) later quantified and examined these data . They found that regardless of the direction of the specific heart rate response ( i.e. , heart rate increases or decreases ) , heart rate variability was always suppressed during attention . Based on subsequent research , Porges and his colleagues constructed a twocomponent model of attention ( Porges , 1976 , 1980 ) . The first component is reactive and involuntary . It consists of an organism 's initial reaction to an external stimulus , based on stimulus characteristics such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is associated with directional heart rate responses and may be mediated by either sympathetic excitation or vagal inhibition . The second component consists of an organism 's voluntary and sustained response to a stimulus . This active form of attention is characterized by a reduction in heart rate variability , respiratory , and motor inhibition ( Porges , 1991b ) . This second component is mediated by the parasympathetic nervous system . Subsequent studies with infants , children , and adults have found a strong association between vagal tone and attentional abilities . Linnemeyer and Porges ( 1986 ) observed the behavior of 6-month-old infants as they engaged in a visual recognition memory task . Infants with high vagal tone looked at novel stimuli longer during test trials and displayed better recognition memory than infants with low vagal tone . Vagal tone has also been associated with sustained attention and faster reaction time during a stimulus-search task in school-aged children . Porges and Humphreys ( 1977 ) assessed physiological response patterns related to vagal tone and the allocation of attention in retarded adolescents and nondelayed children of ' equivalent mental age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate variability ( suggestive of low vagal tone ) . Significant group differences in heart rate variability patterns also emerged as subjects engaged in // cognitive tasks demanding sustained attention . The retarded adolescents did not suppress heart rate variability during the task . This atypical pattern indicates deficits in parasympathetic control over the heart and suggests a physiological concomitant of developmentally delayed children 's attentional difficulties . Thus , evidence indicates a clear and reliable relationship between active attention , the suppression of heart rate variability , and vagal tone . A logical question at this point might be why would a system ( the PNS ) that is associated with maintenance , recovery , and homeostasis be suppressed during attentional processes ? Heart rate variability is a sign of healthy functioning and decreases in heart rate variability and vagal tone occur with illness , stress , and aging ( Porges , 1985 ) . Porges ( 1991b ) suggested that " heart rate variability is a marker of the efficiency of the neural feedback mechanism and may index the health status of the individual 's capacity to organize physiological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The actions of the autonomic nervous system are ergotrophic ( related to life support and work ) and trophotropic ( related to growth ) . The parasympathetic system is critical for both of these functions . Ergotrophic functions include physical work , stress , and intense emotions . Porges ( 1991b ) noted that attentional processes are also ergotrophic and that sustained attention is particularly costly to organisms . Normal homeostatic processes are , therefore , disrupted during these periods . The ability to subjugate homeostatic needs to attend appropriately to relevant aspects of the environment is an adaptive function needed for continued survival ( Porges , 1991 ) . The suppression of vagal tone appears to be a necessary physiological state for the promotion of sustained attention . In general , individuals with low vagal tone are less able to suppress or modulate their vagal tone to meet immediate challenges in their environment . For example , the retarded subjects studied by Porges and Humphreys ( 1977 ) exhibited low basal vagal tone and an inability to suppress vagal tone during attention-demanding tasks . This general finding has also been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raskin , 1969 ; Richards , 1985 ) . Researchers have identified two anomalous groups that do not fit this general pattern , hyperactive children and regulatory-disordered infants . Hyperactive children have normal resting levels of vagal tone , yet are unable to suppress their vagal tone during attention-demanding tasks . Medication given to these children not only increases their ability to attend , but is paralleled by a suppression in heart rate variability ( forges , Walter , Korb , &; Sprague , 1975 ) . Regulatory-disordered infants have high vagal tone and are highly reactive to certain types of stimulation . They also show deficits in physiological organization , fail to establish normal sleep ? wake cycles , and are rated as being highly irritable and difficult . Although these infants have high vagal tone , their responses to attentiondemanding tasks are extremely heterogeneous ( Degangi , DiPietro , Greenspan , &; Porges , 1991 ) . Many of these infants have a difficult time regulating their autonomic nervous systems to support attention and information processing . It is interesting that the regulatory disordered infants studied by Degangi et @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infants with high vagal tone . At this point , however , it is unclear how this may influence their regulatory and attentional abilities . Research with these two anomalous groups of children may further illuminate the precise physiological processes necessary for attention . Hence , research indicates that the vagal brake is clearly important in attentional processes . What of the sympathetic accelerator ? The role of the sympathetic nervous system in the stress response has been recognized for some time ( Cannon , 1914 ) . As we have already discussed , high levels of arousal , especially arousal associated with anxiety , have detrimental effects on attentional processes . In the following section we will explore the hypothesis that individual differences in cardiovascular reactivity and Type A behavior pattern impact attentional processes and lead to reduced resiliency . The Sympathetic Accelerator The sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system is much more diffuse anatomically than the parasympathetic branch . There is no main nerve in the sympathetic nervous system analagous to the vagus . One way that the activity of the sympathetic nervous system is assessed is by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , primarily the catecholamines . Another way is through the measurement of cardiovascular reactivity . The secretion of adrenaline and related catecholamines is largely mediated by the sympathetic nervous system through its innervation of the adrenal medulla . Cardiovascular reactivity ( CVR ) appears to be an individual difference variable which emerges early in childhood and is quite stable across time ( Downey , Cresan , &; Berenson , 1989 ; Matthew , Rakaczky , &; Stoney , 1987 ) . Individual differences in CVR have been studied in research on Type A and Type B personality . Research with children suggests that they see Type A peers as being less fun to play with and the cause of interpersonal problems ( Whalen &; Henker , 1986 ) . Observations of their behavior in class and during structured group tasks indicates that they are more likely to talk , make noise , disrupt others , and engage in negative contact with peers . Work by Kurdek and Lillie ( 1985 ) also indicates that Type A boys may lack a number of social cognitive skills , such as knowledge about friendships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Treiber , Mabe , Riley , &; Can , 1989 ) . Caregiver variables may be involved in the evolution of Type A Behavior Pattern ( TABP ) in children . Type A sons tend to have fathers who have high expectations of them yet perceive that they are not reaching these goals ( Kliewer &; Weidner , 1987 ) . Type A sons are also more likely to have Type A fathers ( Bracke , 1986 ; Weidner , Sexton , Matazarro , &; Periera , 1988 ) . Hence , not only might these fathers encourage Type A behavior by communicating excessively high goals and dissatisfaction with their son 's achievements , but they may serve as role models of the Type A behavior pattern . // Adults classified as being Type A also exhibit this pattern of high expectations and negative cognitions concerning achievements . O'Keefe &; Smith ( 1988 ) reported that some Type A males ( i.e , those rated by the Framington Scale ) exhibited a pattern of high expectations , high levels of self-criticism , and dissatisfaction with their accomplishments . These males @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to generalize their failures . Type A fathers may be as critical of their children as they are of themselves . 6 Designing a Family Psychophysiology Laboratory : The Methods of Our Study This chapter describes the methods we used , which come from a " social psychophysiological " approach to studying families , with a heavy emphasis on observational methods and longitudinal research . We explain the initial rationale we had for studying marriages , their longitudinal courses , and their effects on children 's emotional and social development , with particular emphasis on the child peer system . OVERVIEW We began our study in 1986 . We wanted our study to be a longitudinal prospective study in which we would follow families through important life transitions and see whether a family 's meta-emotion structure affects children 's psychological adjustment over time . We also wanted to begin with the youngest preschool age children ( ages 4 ? 6 ) who could sit still enough for the relatively long time periods necessary for us to obtain good physiological measures . Our goal was to follow the children through their transition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transition for children and families . Our central hypothesis was that children from families with emotion-coaching meta-emotion structures would show better academic abilities , social adjustment , and emotional well-being both before and during this transition . Families were recontacted when the children were approximately 8 years old , which coincided with their entry into second grade . Procedures consisted of laboratory sessions and home interviews for both parents and children . We also asked parents to complete questionnaires about their marriage , their child 's social and emotional adjustment , and basic deem124 6 . A FAMILY PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY LABORATORY graphic information ( i.e. , income , education , occupation ) . All laboratory sessions involved the measurement of physiological states ( e.g. , heart rate ) and observation of interpersonal interaction . The physiological measures were synchronized with our observational data from marital and parent ? child interaction , so we could understand how interaction between families members affects bodily states . Our interest in obtaining good physiological recordings from children led us to the first of many challenges . One of the basic tenets of physiological data collection is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are moving . Hence our challenge : how to keep 4 ? 5 year old children seated ! To do so , we designed a laboratory centered around an outer space motif . Children were dressed in space suits , and were seated in a mock-up Apollo space capsule . Our research assistants , who were in the next room , conversed with the children via intercom and referred to themselves as " Mission Control . " We even conducted a count-down and blast-off to keep children involved in the outer space theme . The decision to use the space capsule theme grew out of a mini-study we conducted at Chuck-E-Cheese Pizza Time restaurant . We found that the most popular two toys that children in this age group gravitated toward were a space capsule and video games . Both of these procedures were used in our study . INITIAL CONTACT WITH FAMILIES Families were recruited from advertisements in the classified ads section of the local city newspaper . In selecting families , we were looking for married couples who had a 4 ? 5-year-old child and who varied widely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participated in the study ; approximately half of the families had a male child and half the families had a female child . We employed a telephone version of the Locke ? Wallace ( Locke &; Wallace , 1959 ) marital satisfaction scale ( Krokoff , Gottman , &; Roy , 1988 ) to ensure that couples had a wide range of marital satisfaction in our study , because it is well known that marital satisfaction can affect parenting and child outcomes . Couples also completed the paper-and-pencil version of the Locke ? Wallace Marital Satisfaction Inventory ( Locke &; Wallace , 1959 ) before they came to the laboratory . The mean marital satisfaction score was 111.1 ( SD = 29.6 ) . Families meeting our criteria were then visited in their homes by a research assistant . We met with the couples first and conducted the Oral History Interview . The oral history interview is a semi-structured interview conducted in the couple 's home , in which the interviewer asks a set of open-ended questions . The interviewer asks about the history of the couple 's relationship ; how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married , about the good times and the had times in their marriage , their philosophy of what makes a marriage work , and how their marriage has changed over the years . This interview places the couples in the role of experts as couples tell us what makes a marriage work . We find that // couples enjoy reminiscing about their marriage , and this interview provides a wonderful opportunity for us to establish rapport . Moreover , we have found that variables obtained from this interview predicted divorce and marital stability with 94% accuracy ( Buehlman , Gottman , &; Katz , 1992 ) . Six dimensions from the oral history interview that were predictive of marital dissolution were examined ( Buehlman , 1996 ) . They included : Fondness/Affection , Negativity Towards Spouse , Weness versus Separateness , Conflict is Handled Through a Discussion of Emotional Issues , Chaos , and Glorifying the Struggle ( see Appendix 6.1 for detailed descriptions ) . In our next home visit , we met with the child . The main purpose of this visit was to acquaint the children with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reluctant to have the physiological sensors necessary for physiological monitoring placed on their bodies , and that prior familiarity with these procedures would allay any fears they might have . Our assistants showed the children photographs of our space capsule and other children participating in the procedures . Photographs obtained from NASA depicting real astronauts were also shown , including ones of astronauts having their hearts and body processes monitored . We explained that like real astronauts , they too would have sensors placed on their body that monitored their hearts beating and other important bodily processes . We also attached a sensor to the child 's body to show them what the hook-up procedure would be like once they came to the laboratory and how the sensors would feel . Children also got to color a space capsule of their choosing and keep their art work to help remind them of their upcoming experience in our laboratory . One of the peak events in the visit was when children met " Space Puppy , " the stuffed animal who would accompany them into outer space . By the time they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eager for their adventure as astronauts . We also used the home visit to obtain an assessment of intellectual functioning using the Block Design , Picture Completion , and Information Subscales of the Wechsler Preschool Scales of Intelligence ( WPPSI , Wechsler , 1974 ) . VISITS TO THE LABORATORY Meta-Emotion Interview Each parent was separately interviewed about their own experience of sadness and anger , their philosophy of emotional expression and control , and their feelings , attitudes , and responses to their children 's anger and sadness . Their behavior during this interview was audio-taped ( see chapter 4 for a more detailed description of the interview ) . The audio tapes of the meta-emotion interview were coded using a specific checklist rating system that codes for parents ' awareness of their own anger and sadness , their own regulation of anger and sadness , // and their awareness and coaching of their child 's anger and sadness ( see Appendix 6.1 for more detailed information ) . Marital Interaction To obtain a picture of how different couples resolve conflict , we asked married couples to spend 15 minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas for discussion were determined from each spouse 's ratings on the Couple 's Relationship Inventory ( Gottman , Markman , &; Notarius , 1977 ) . This questionnaire consists of 10 general areas in which couples typically report disagreement ( e.g. , money , communication , in-laws ) , and each spouse indicates the extent and length of the disagreement . Based on each spouse 's ratings , and through the course of a play-by-play interview in which each spouse articulated their version of the problem ( Gottman , 1979 ) , two top problems were selected for the interaction task . Problems were selected for discussion if they were areas in which the spouses had differing perspectives , rather than areas in which both spouses recognize that they are living with a problematic situation ( e.g. , both agree that they do not have enough money ) . Videotapes of marital interaction were obtained and used for later observational coding . The marital interaction was coded for problem solving behavior and emotional communication using the Rapid Couple Interaction Scoring System ( RCISS , Krokoff , Gottman , &; Hass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gottman , 1994 ; see Appendix for detailed discussion of coding systems ) . In both the coding of specific emotional communications and problem solving , we were interested in those variables that we have previously found to be predictive of marital dissolution ( Gottman , 1993a , 1993b , 1994 ; Gottman &; Levenson , 1992 ) , because we reasoned that processes that are detrimental to the health of the marriage would also be detrimental to the child 's psychological well-being . On the SPAFF , these codes included disgust , contempt , belligerence , stonewalling , and defensiveness . On the RCISS , they included stonewalling , defensiveness and contempt . We also included two SPAFF codes that reflected positive interaction between spouses ; these were affection and validation . Parent ? Child Interaction Parents interacted with their children while the children were seated in the space capsule . The parents were informed that the child had previously heard a story , and they were to find out what the story was . After they got as much of the story as they could , they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game . In order to make this procedure somewhat more challenging for the parents , the story that the children heard did not follow normal story grammar and was read in a monotone voice , and so the story was only mildly interesting for the children . Also , the video game was turned on while the parents were asking the child about // the story , creating a conflict between the goals of the parents and children : The children wanted to play the video game , whereas the parents wanted to find out about the story . We reasoned that this task mirrored common everyday situations in which parents want the child to do one thing and the child wants to do another . The interaction , which was adapted from Cowan and Cowan ( 1990 ) , lasted 10 minutes . The parent ? child interaction was coded for negative and positive parenting using the SPAFF and Kahen Coding systems . Using the SPAFF codes , the total amount of time father , mother , and child spent in the affective states of affection , excitement , anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Kahen Engagement and Affect coding systems enabled us to determine the amount of intrusiveness , mockery and criticism parents expressed toward their child . The Cowan and Cowan ( 1982 ) coding system was also used to tap parental warmth , coldness , and limit-setting , and the degree to which parents were warm or cold toward each other while interacting with their child in the role as co-parents ( see Appendix for detailed information ) . CHILDREN 'S FACIAL EXPRESSIVENESS Children 's Reactions to Emotional Films We were also interested in the amount of positive and negative affectivity that children display spontaneously while viewing films designed to elicit emotion . To examine this question , children were shown segments of emotion-eliciting films . Each film clip was preceded by a neutral story and an emotion induction film clip of an actress who acted out the emotions of the protagonist in the upcoming story . The function of the emotion induction was to direct the child to identify with the protagonist and to experience the specific emotion in question . The emotion elicitation was not very successful : instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in each film . Hence , we will refer to the films by their titles instead of by the emotion they were intended to induce . The child viewed clips from six films : ( 1 ) Fly fishing , ( 2 ) from the Wizard of Oz the flying monkey scene , ( 3 ) from Charlotte 's Web the scene where Charlotte dies , ( 4 ) from Meaning of Life the restaurant scene , ( 5 ) from the Wizard of Oz when Toto is taken away , and ( 6 ) Daisy . Facial expressiveness was coded using Ekman and Friesen 's ( 1978 ) Emotion Facial Action Coding System . Facial expressions of anger , disgust , sadness , fear , and happiness were coded . Directed Facial Action Task We were also interested in individual differences in children 's ability to pose cross-culturally universal facial expressions of emotion . Following Ekman , Levenson , and Friesen ( 1983 ) , we asked children to move specific facial muscles // that corresponded with specific emotional expressions . Children posed facial expressions corresponding with the emotions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Children 's success at making these faces were coded using a modified version of the Ekman and Friesen 's ( 1978 ) Facial Action Coding System . CHILD 'S PHYSIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONING Autonomic Assessment We were interested in obtaining an index of the child 's sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system activation . Two main physiological processes were monitored to obtain these measures . We looked at the child 's heart rate and how much they were sweating under resting or baseline conditions , during parent ? child interaction , and while children were watching the films . Children 's heart rate gave us several measures , including mean levels of interbeat interval ( i.e. , time between heart beats ) at baseline , interbeat interval variability , and the change or reactivity of heart rate variability in different situations ( e.g. from baseline to parent ? child interaction ) . Vagal tone was also computed as an index of parasympathetic activation of the heart . We also measured how much the child was sweating , or the child 's skin conductance level ( SCL ) , as an index of sympathetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is sensitive to changes in levels of sweat in the eccrine sweat glands located in the hand . Mean skin conductance level during baseline was computed as an index of general sympathetic nervous system arousal . Child 's Stress-Related Hormones General physiological arousal was also measured by examining stress-related hormones in the child 's urine . We collected a 24-hour sample of urine from the child , usually on a Sunday when the children were at home all day and could better comply with our request . We sheepishly called this our " Sunday Pee Procedure . " A 24-hour sample was necessary to control for variations of hormones within a day . Assays were conducted to determine urinary catecholamines dopamine , norepinephrine , and epinephrine , as well as cortisol concentrations . Although it is an oversimplification , the catecholamine hormones are generally responsive to acute and chronic stressors related to both hostility and active coping whereas cortisol is responsive to sadness , depression , separation anxiety , loss , and passive coping ( Gunnar , 1989 ; Henry , 1986 ; Henry &; Meehan , 1981 ; Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Snidman , 1988 ) . PEER INTERACTION HOME VISIT One of the major goals of our research was to attempt to predict from family variables collected during the preschool period the children 's social competence with peers during middle childhood . Toward this end , the peer interaction home visits were included to assess the child 's social competence in dyadic interaction . Each child was audiotaped at home in one 30-minute dyadic play session with a peer the mother identified as the child 's best friend ( regardless of gender ) . Because play with a best friend likely involves social processes that are less likely to occur with an unacquainted peer , this procedure provides an estimate of the highest level of social competence that a child can attain . The audio tapes were coded with the MACRO coding system ( see Gottman &; Parker , 1986 ) . Two main sets of peer variables were expected to be related to the family 's meta-emotion style : the amount of negative affect during peer play and the overall quality of the play ( see Appendix 6.1 for more detailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later for follow-up assessments when the children were on average 8 years old ( M = 96.9 months ; Range = 82-110 ) . Ninety-five percent of the families in the initial sample and 86% of the children 's teachers at follow-up agreed to participate in the Time-2 assessments . Time-2 assessment consisted of parent and teacher ratings of child outcomes , couple 's reports of considerations of marital dissolution and marital satisfaction , and couple 's physical health . Marital Outcomes Marital Dissolution and Satisfaction . We conducted telephone interviews to ask couples about their thoughts about marital dissolution . Interviews were used since couple 's thoughts about marital dissolution predict actual dissolution ( Booth &; White , 1980 ; Gottman &; Levenson , 1992 ) . Interview questions were aimed at assessing whether couples had separated or divorced during the intervening three year period or had any serious considerations of separation or divorce . Each Spouse was interviewed individually and was asked the following five questions : In the last three years , have you seriously considered separation ? " , " In the last three years , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last three years , have you and your spouse separated ? " , " If so , how many months have you been separated , or how long was your separation period ? " , and " In the last three years , have you and your spouse divorced ? " . Questionnaires were also distributed to // Adults classified as being Type A also exhibit this pattern of high expectations and negative cognitions concerning achievements . O'Keefe &; Smith ( 1988 ) reported that some Type A males ( i.e , those rated by the Framington Scale ) exhibited a pattern of high expectations , high levels of self-criticism , and dissatisfaction with their accomplishments . These males tended to have low expectations of success and were likely to generalize their failures . Type A fathers may be as critical of their children as they are of themselves . 6 Designing a Family Psychophysiology Laboratory : The Methods of Our Study This chapter describes the methods we used , which come from a " social psychophysiological " approach to studying families , with a heavy emphasis on observational methods and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for studying marriages , their longitudinal courses , and their effects on children 's emotional and social development , with particular emphasis on the child peer system . OVERVIEW We began our study in 1986 . We wanted our study to be a longitudinal prospective study in which we would follow families through important life transitions and see whether a family 's meta-emotion structure affects children 's psychological adjustment over time . We also wanted to begin with the youngest preschool age children ( ages 4 ? 6 ) who could sit still enough for the relatively long time periods necessary for us to obtain good physiological measures . Our goal was to follow the children through their transition to elementary school , as this can be a difficult transition for children and families . Our central hypothesis was that children from families with emotion-coaching meta-emotion structures would show better academic abilities , social adjustment , and emotional well-being both before and during this transition . Families were recontacted when the children were approximately 8 years old , which coincided with their entry into second grade . Procedures consisted of laboratory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We also asked parents to complete questionnaires about their marriage , their child 's social and emotional adjustment , and basic demo // obtain information about their current satisfaction with their marriage . As at Time-1 , couples completed the Locke-Wallace Marital Satisfaction Inventory . Physical Health . The health of adults was assessed to test hypotheses about whether adults who have a more emotion-enhancing meta-emotion structure would be more physically healthy than adults who dismiss or deny emotion . The Cornell Medical Index ( e.g. , Klonkoff &; Landrine , 1992 ) and the Krokoff Health Index were used for this purpose . The Krokoff Health Index asks each spouse to report on the health of their partner . One advantage of this method is that it attempts to control for the well-known reporting bias that males tend to underreport illness . Child Functioning Five general categories of child functioning were examined at age 8 : ( a ) Academic achievement and attentional abilities , ( b ) Peer relations , ( c ) Negative affect and behavior problems , ( d ) Emotion regulation abilities , and ( e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Children were individually administered the Peabody Individual Achievement Test ( PIAT-R ) as a measure of academic achievement ( see , Costenbader &; Adams , 1991 ) . They were administered the mathematics , reading recognition , reading comprehension , and general information tests . To assess their attentional abilities , they were also given the Stroop Interference Task . This test has three sections , one section in which the names of colors written in black ink ( W ) , one section in which there are colored X 's ( C ) , and one section in which the names of colors are written in ink different than the color name ( CW ) . The CW section is the most taxing of the child 's attentional abilities , and has been used as an assessment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( Lufi , Cohen , &; Parish , 1990 ) . The CW score was used as our measure of attentional skills . Peer Relations : Observational Measures and Teacher Ratings . As at Time1 , peer interaction with a best friend was audiotaped and later coded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also completed the Dodge Peer Aggression Scale , which contains items that measure the degree to which the child uses overt aggression with peers . Negative Affect and Behavior Problems . To give us some idea about the amount of negative affect displayed by children in an average week , mothers filled out a questionnaire about their child 's emotions in the past week , checking the specific emotions they observed their children to display ( Izard , 1982 ) . The total number of negative emotions for the week were computed . Mothers also // completed the Child Behavior Checklist ( CBCL ; Achenbach &; Edelbrock , 1986 ) . The CBCL is a well-established measure that consists of ratings of academic performance , general adaptive characteristics and 112 behavior problems . Total number of behavior problems were computed as outcome measures . Subscales tapping aggression and social withdrawal were also used . Teachers completed the Child Adaptive Behavior Inventory ( CABI ; Cowan &; Cowan , 1990 ) . The CABI consists of 91 items that are less pathological in nature than most current measures of behavior problems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Total score and the subscales of antisocial behavior and negative peer engagement were examined . Emotion Regulation Abilities . Mothers completed the Katz ? Gottman Emotion Regulation Scale ( Katz &; Gottman , 1986 ) to report the degree to which their child requires external regulation of emotion by adults . The Down Regulation subscale , which measures whether parents find that they need to help them calm down and focus attention when the child gets upset , was used in this study . Child 's Physical Health . Child illness was assessed by parental report using a version of the Rand Corporation Health Insurance Study measures ( see Gottman and Katz , 1989 ) : The following true ? false items were summed : " In general , would you say that this child 's health is excellent , good , fair , or poor ? , " " The child 's heath is excellent , " " The child seems to resist illness very well , " " When something is going around this child usually catches it , " " This child has had a nosebleed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detail on Measures and Coding META-EMOTION CODING SYSTEM The audiotapes of the meta-emotion interview were coded using a specific checklist rating system that codes for parents ' awareness of their own anger and sadness , their own regulation of anger and sadness , and their coaching with their child 's anger and sadness . For each dimension the coding manual was quite detailed and specific . The awareness score was a sum of 12 subscales : experiencing the emotion , being able to distinguish the emotion from others , having various experiences with the emotion , being descriptive of the experience of the emotion , being descriptive of the physical sensations connected with this emotion , being descriptive of the cognitive processes connected with this emotion , providing a descriptive anecdote , knowing the causes of the emotion , being aware of remediation processes , answering questions about the emotion easily , without hesitation or confusion , talking at length about this emotion , and showing interest or excitement about this emotion . Coaching was a sum of 11 scales : showing respect for the child 's experience of the emotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child is upset ; intervening in situations that give rise to the emotion ; comforting the child ; teaching the child rules for appropriate expression of the emotion ; educating the child about the nature of this emotion ; teaching the child strategies to soothe the child 's own emotion ; involvement in the child 's experience of the emotion ; confidence about how to deal with this emotion ; having given thought and energy to the emotion and what he or she wants their child to know about this emotion ( goals ) ; and , using strategies that are age and situation appropriate . The range of interobserver reliabilities , computed as correlations across scales for independent observers of this coding was 0.73 ? 0.86. // We were also interested in parent 's feeling of being out of control with respect to the emotions of sadness and anger . To measure this construct , we summed together the following items from the meta-emotion coding system : has difficulty regulating the intensity of the emotion ; the emotion occurs often ; the emotion is difficult to get over ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks the emotion can be dangerous ; and the person has needed help with the emotion . Separate variables indexing parent 's report of feeling out of control were computed for sadness and anger . // MARITAL INTERACTION Problem Solving Behavior The marital interaction was coded using the Rapid Couple Interaction Scoring System ( RCISS , Krokoff , Gottman , &; Hass , 1989 ) , which employs a checklist of behaviors that are scored for the speaker and nine behaviors that are scored for the listener on each turn of speech . RCISS behavioral codes can be scored in terms of underlying positive ? negative dimension . The data are also coded each turn at speech and later summarized into the following scales : ( 1 ) Complain/ criticize ; ( 2 ) Defensiveness ; ( 3 ) Contempt ; ( 4 ) Stonewalling , a set of behaviors that describe the listener 's withdrawal ; ( 5 ) Positive presentation of issues ; ( 6 ) Assent , simple agreements and positive vocal listener backchannels ; ( 7 ) Humor ; and , ( 8 ) Positive listener . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cumulated speaker slopes for the variable Positive minus Negative . Overall Cohen 's kappa reliability was 0.71 , with a range of 0.70 ? 0.81 . The four negative scales of the RCISS are used here , as well as the overall level of positive minus negative speaker codes ; this latter index was found to be predictive of marital stability in Gottman and Levenson ( 1992 ) . Affect Marital interaction was also coded in real time using the Specific Affect Coding System , ( Gottman , 1996 ; SPAFF ) . SPAFF is a gestalt coding system in which coders consider the verbal content , voice tone , context , facial expression , gestures , and body movement of the spouse they are coding . This system codes 16 emotions and emotional behavior patterns at both high and low levels of intensity . In addition to Neutral there are ten negative codes : ( 1 ) Anger , ( 2 ) Disgust , ( 3 ) Contempt , ( 4 ) Sadness , ( 5 ) Tension , ( 6 ) Whining , ( 7 ) Defensiveness , ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 10 ) Stonewalling . There are five positive codes : ( 11 ) Affection , ( 12 ) Humor , ( 13 ) Interest , ( 14 ) Joy , and ( 15 ) Validation . Emotions were coded separately for both husband and wife and done in real time . Scores reflect the percentage of time over the IS-minute interaction that each // code was used . Codes were collapsed across intensity level for all analyses . Reliability for SPAFF codes was computed using interobserver correlation coefficients . Only those behaviors that have been found to predict marital dissolution in other studies ( e.g. , Gottman and Levenson , 1992 ) were analyzed ; these codes are husband and wife contempt , belligerence , and defensiveness , and their sum ( a variable we called hostility ) . Facial Expressiveness To examine the relationship between meta-emotion structure and facial expressiveness , we coded the marital interaction using Ekman and Friesen 's ( 1978 ) Emotion Facial Action Coding System ( EMFACS ) . Using this coding system , we can examine specific emotional expressions as well as non-emotional expressions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boss contractions ) . We obtained measures of the frequency of anger and sadness facial expressions , as well as measures of overall expressivity and emotional control . CODING OF ORAL HISTORY INTERVIEW Oral History Coding System The oral history interview was coded on seven dimensions ( Buehlman , 1991 ) : 1 . Fondness/Affection ( husband and wife ) is a dimension that rates couples according to how much they seem to be in love or fond of each other . This includes compliments , positive affect , and reminiscing about romantic , special times ; 2 . Negativity Towards Spouse ( husband and wife ) assesses the extent to which spouses are vague or general about what attracted them to their spouse , the extent to which they express disagreement during the interview , the display of negative affect towards one another during the interview , and the extent to which they are critical of their spouse during the interview ; 3 . Expansiveness versus Withdrawal ( husband and wife ) is a dimension that categorizes each spouse according to how expressive they are during the interview . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are withdrawn ; 4 . We-ness versus Separateness ( husband and wife ) codes how much a spouse identifies his or her self as part of a couple versus emphasizes his or her individuality or independence ; 5 . Gender stereotypy ( one score per couple ) assessed how traditional a couple 's beliefs and values were . Couples were coded on how gender stereoOBSERVATION // typed they were in emotional expression , responsiveness , and traditional male or female roles ; 6 . Couples were also rated on how they reported dealing with conflict . They were rated on the following dimensions : ( a ) Volatility ( one score per couple ) are those that are intense both in positive and negative ways . Both spouses have extreme feelings toward each other . They fight a lot but they are still very much in love with one another . ( b ) Chaos ( one score per couple ) is a dimension that codes couples who report that they have little control over their own lives . These couples may have had unexpected problems and hardships come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with . They have a laissez-faire attitude that life is hard and must be accepted as hard . ( c ) Glorifying the Struggle ( one score per couple ) is a dimension for couples that have had hard times in their marriage but have gotten through them and are proud of the fact . The difficult times have helped them grow stronger and closer to each other . They glorify their marriage as being the most important thing in the world to them ; 7 . Marital disappointment and disillusionment ( husband and wife ) tells us which couples have given up on their marriage . Couples who feel defeated or depressed about their marriage fall into this category . They often say that they do not know what makes a marriage work and will often mention unfilled needs or expectations that they had about marriage in general . Overall reliability for the oral history Coding System was 75% agreement between coders . Intercorrelations for individual dimensions ranged between .71 and .91 . OBSERVATION CODING OF PARENT ? CHILD INTERACTION Parenting was coded using the Kahen Engagement Coding System ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and the Cowan coding system ( Gottman , in press ) . The KECS consists of 7 parental engagement codes including 3 positive , 3 negative and 1 neutral code . The three Kahen positive engagement codes were : ( a ) Engaged , which consisted of parental attention toward the child , ( h ) Positive Directiveness , in which parents issued a directive statement that began in a positive way ( e.g. , " move to your right " ) , and ( c ) Responds to Child 's Needs , in which parents responded to a child 's question or complaint . The three negative engagement codes were : ( a ) Disengaged , in which parents were not attending to the child , ( b ) Negative Directiveness , in which parents issued a // directive statement that began in a negative way ( e.g. , " do n't move around so much " ) , and ( c ) Intrusiveness , which involved physical interference with the child 's actions ( e.g. , grabbing the joystick ) . The KACS also consists of 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ( a ) Affection , which consisted of praise and physical affection , ( b ) Enthusiasm , which was coded as cheering and excitement at the child 's performance , and ( c ) Humor , which involved parental laughter or joking . The three negative affect codes were : ( a ) Criticism , which involved direct disparaging comments or put-downs of the child 's behavior or performance , ( b ) Anger , in which parents were visibly frustrated by the child 's actions or demonstrated disappointment , annoyance , or irritation toward the child , and ( c ) Derisive Humor , in which parents used humor at the child 's expense ( e.g. , through sarcasm or by making fun of the child ) . Parent ? child interaction was coded continuously in real time with coding synchronized to the original parent ? child interaction . The total number of times each variable occurred in the 10-minute parent ? child interaction session was recorded and totals across time were calculated for each of the 14 parent ? child interaction variables . This index is therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 10-minute period . Mothers and fathers were coded by independent observers . Engagement and affect dimensions were also coded by independent observers . Reliability was calculated across coders using a correlation coefficient . Because total number of seconds within each parent code was the variable computed and used in all data analyses , the appropriate reliability statistic is a correlation coefficient rather than Cohen 's kappa or percentage agreement . For the KECS , the mean correlation was .96 , with a range of .86 ? .99 , and for the KACS the mean correlation was .93 , with a range of .84 ? .97 . We computed the sum of derisive humor , intrusiveness , and criticism for both parents to form our Derogation variable . The Kahen systems were also are used to measure the Authoritative/Responsive dimension , which consists of parental affection , engagement , positive structuring , responsiveness , and enthusiasm ; we computed the sum of these variables across parents , omitting the father enthusiasm code because for fathers alone , enthusiasm was significantly correlated with his criticism . The parent 's behavior during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Cowan ( 1987 ) coding system . This coding system codes parents behavior on dimensions of warmth-coldness , presence or lack of structure and limit setting , whether parents back down or not when their child is noncompliant , anger and displeasure , unresponsiveness or responsiveness , and whether or not parents make maturity demands of their child . The behavior of parents toward each other during their interactions with their child ( their coparenting ) is also coded on dimensions of warmth , cooperation or competition , anger , disagreement , responsiveness , pleasure in co-parenting , clarity of communication , and amount of interaction . For the purposes of this study , only the // warmth dimension ( parenting and co-parenting ) was of interest . For the parenting dimension , coders rated the overall degree of warmth and the highest level of warmth and coldness exhibited by each parent . For the co-parenting dimension , coders rated the overall degree of warmth and the highest level of warmth and coldness exhibited by the couple toward each other . Warmth is defined as the sum of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Reliability between observers was variable . For the warmth variable we created the inter-reliability was .64 . Parent ? child affective interaction was also coded using the SPAFF coding system . The total amount of time father , mother , and child spent in the negative affective states of whining , sadness , anxiety , and the blend of whining and anxiety for the child and the totals summing across all family members was computed . Cohen 's kappas were computed for the entire coding system and the average kappa was 0.69 , with a range from 0.52 ? 0.85 . PEER INTERACTION The Rapid Macro ( R-MACRO ) peer interaction coding system ( Gottman , 1983 ) was used to code best friend peer play . The R-MACRO consists of 43 specific behaviors ( 21 positive and 22 negative ) that index children 's coordination of play . For example , there are codes indexing the ability to repair conversation included skill at clarifying messages and conflict management ; conversational skills are indexed by children 's success at information exchange , self-disclosure , and gossip and their ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , positive parallel play , common ground success and connected interaction ; solitary play or disrupted interaction is indexed by children 's tendency to monologue , to disrupt play by departing from the play area , or to require parental direction of play ; negative and positive affect codes include : Anger , Crying , Bossiness , Affection , Sympathy , Sharing , Laughter , and Joy/Excitement . Totals for individual codes were calculated by summing the frequency of each code 's occurrence across all 3 minute periods . Reliability was calculated across coders using a correlation coefficient . The mean correlation was .72 , with a range of .60 ? .88 . CHILD PHYSIOLOGY autonomic Physiology We computed one index of vagal tone as the amount of variance in the into-twat Interval ( related to the heart rate : Heart rate = 60000/interbeat-interval ) spec138 APPENDIX 6.1 : MEASURES AND CODING trum that was within the child 's respiratory range ; we used a spectral time-series analysis . This measures respiratory sinus arrhythmia , a measure of parasympathetic nervous system tonus , which has been found to index attentional processes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We also computed mean levels of interbeat interval at baseline , interbeat interval variability ( a measure of vagal tone , Izard , Porges , Simons , &; Haynes , 1991 ) , and the reactivity of heart rate variability from baseline to the mean of the parent ? child interaction ( an index of the child 's ability to modulate vagal tone , DiPietro , Porges , &; Uhly , 1992 ) , and mean skin conductance level during baseline ( first visit to the lab ) . These were designed as indices of the amount of the child 's chronic physiological arousal , and the parasympathetic functioning of the child . In addition to their relation with attentional measures and measures of recognition memory and attention to novel stimuli in 6 month old infants ( Linnemeyer &; Porges , 1986 ) , and regulatory competence ( DeGangi , DiPietro , Greenspan , &; Porges , 1991 ) , vagal tone measures are related to socio-emotional competence . For example , vagal tone measures have been found to relate to facial expressivity in 5 month old infants ( Stifter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developmental well being ( DiPietro , Porges , &; Uhly , 1992 ) , to the ability to cope with mildly frustrating situations and stressful events ( Fox , 1989 ) , and to the initial entry to preschool ( Fox &; Field , 1989 ) . The computation of vagal tone has included spectral and cross-spectral analysis ( with respiration ) and the computation of heart period variability ; generally these measures are developmentally stable , related to one another and function well ( Grossman , Van Beek , &; Wientjes , 1990 ; Izard , Porges , Simons , &; Haynes , 1991 ) . For our physiological variables we selected as an estimate of the child 's baseline vagal tone the vagal tone when the child was listening to a neutral story about fly fishing , a variable we called BASE VAGAL . The child 's ability to withdraw vagal tone was estimated as a difference between this estimate of basal vagal tone and the child 's vagal tone during an exciting film clip taken from the Wizard of Oz ( the scene when the flying monkeys kidnap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong emotional response ; we call this second variable DELTA VAGAL ; DELTA will be abbreviated as DEL . This second variable indexes the child 's ability to suppress vagal tone when engaging with a strong emotional stimulus that includes an environmental demand for changing attentional focus . or regulating emotion ; in our case the engagement with the environment involves the demands for an emotional response being elicited by the emtional film , as well as the demands to focus attention on the Atari video game the child flayed Immediately after each film clip standing for a difference in vagal tome Iii no the baseline film to the exciting film conditions . However , the order of the items was randomized . Further mathmatical information about the computation of the vagal tone variables can be found in Appendix A at the end of this volume . DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION Parents also completed a questionnaire asking about the family 's income level , occupational status and average education level ( in years ) for husband and wife . To assess income level , couples were asked to indicate the range within which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ score ranging from 1-14 , depending on their income level , with a higher score indicating greater income . Families were also classified according to their occupational status as either blue or white collar , using criteria outlined in Krokoff , Gottman , and Roy ( 1988 ) . 7 The Internal Structure of Parents ' Meta-Emotions This chapter explores the internal structure of our meta-emotion variables , particularly the relationship between the parents ' awareness of their own emotions and their awareness of their children 's emotions , as measured from the interview . How do the parents ' feelings about their own emotions relate to how they will act when their child is experiencing a strong emotion ? Here we ask questions related to the first issues parents must face , namely the emotional baggage parents bring into the parenting role . We ask , " Is there any relationship between how the parents view their own emotions and whether they will coach the child when the child is sad or angry ? " One of the reasons why we think that this question is of some practical importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of duty , guilt , or obligation to encourage the parent to acquire new parenting skills . Tying the parent 's own emotional life to parenting can provide a more " narcissistic " or personal growth motivation for being interested in exploring one 's own parenting . PARENTAL META-EMOTIONS AND COACHING THE CHILD 'S SADNESS AND ANGER The Father The father 's awareness of his own sadness was significantly correlated with his awareness of his own anger , r = 0.53 , p @#@ .001. // ther 's awareness of his own sadness was significantly related to his coaching of his child with both anger and sadness ; interestingly , it was also related to his wife 's coaching of the child with anger and sadness . The more fathers are aware of their own sadness , the more likely they are to coach their children 's emotions , and also the more likely their wives are to coach their children 's emotions . The Father 's Meta-Emotions About Anger . Table 7.1 shows that the father 's awareness of his own anger was significantly related only to his coaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was unrelated to his wife 's coaching of the child with anger and sadness . The Mother The mother 's awareness of her own sadness was also significantly correlated with her awareness of her own anger , r = 0.48 , p @#@ .001 . The Mother 's Meta-Emotions About Sadness . Table 7.1 shows that the mother 's awareness of her own sadness was significantly related to her coaching of her child with sadness ; it was unrelated to her coaching of the child with anger or to her husband 's coaching of the child with anger and sadness . The Mother 's Meta-Emotions About Anger . Table 7.1 shows that the mother 's awareness of her own anger was significantly related to her coaching of her child with both anger and with sadness ; it was unrelated to her husband 's coach ing of the child with anger and sadness . The largest correlations in Table 7.1 suggest that if the father is aware of his own sadness he is likely to coach his child 's anger , whereas if the mother is aware of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sadness . Perhaps this represents a division of labor in parental coaching . How Is Awareness of One 's Own Emotions Related to Awareness of the Child 's Emotions ? In this section , we ask whether parent 's awareness of his or her own emotions is related to the parent 's awareness of the child 's emotion , separately for anger and sadness . As Table 7.2 shows that , based on the coding of the subject 's responses to the meta-emotion interview questions , for both mother and father , the parent 's awareness of their own emotion is significantly correlated with the parent 's awareness of that emotion in their child . This suggests the interesting hypothesis that one vehicle for increasing the parent 's awareness of the child 's emotions may be through self-awareness of the parent 's own emotions . 8 Validity of the Meta-Emotion Interview This chapter asks whether the information we obtained from parents ' self reports about their parenting is , in fact , actually related to the ways they parent , as observed in our laboratory . What is the validity for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interview are talking about their interaction with their children in the interview . Is there any relationship between their coded responses and their actual behavior with their children ? We use the accuracy criterion of observations of actual parent ? child interaction . Unfortunately , we do not yet have data on how parents actually talk to their children during everyday emotional interactions , so instead we substituted our standard laboratory parent ? child interaction . We expect the correlations during this task to be statistically significant , but we do not expect them to be measuring the same thing as the variables tapped by the meta-emotion coaching variable . We employ our three dimensions of parenting as validity criteria . Warmth is based on the Cowans ' Coding system , the Derogation and Scaffolding/Praising dimensions are based on the Kahen systems ( KEACS ) . The KEACS assesses communications of intrusiveness , which is taking over when a child is trying to learn something new , criticising , mocking , or derision , and conveying to the child a sense of his or her own incompetence . In using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parents are intrusive , use derisive humor or mockery , or are critical of their child during the child 's learning of the video game ; we computed the sum of these codes . The Cowans ' Coding System assesses warmth and coldness toward spouse and child ; we computed the sum of these variables minus the parental and co- parent coldness variables . The KEACS // systems also are used to measure the Scaffolding/Praising dimension , which consists of parental affection , engagement , positive structuring , responsiveness , and enthusiasm ; we computed the sum of these variables across parents . Table 8.1 is a summary of the relationship between the parents ' meta-emotion variables for sadness and anger and the three parenting dimensions . The father 's awareness of the child 's sadness was related to parental warmth . Eight of the twelve meta-emotion variables were significantly related to less parental Derogation , and 4 of the 12 variables were related positively to more Scaffolding/ Praising parenting . Thus , there is evidence for the validity of the meta-emotion variables . Even though they are coded from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our laboratory . QUALITATIVE EXAMPLES Two prototypes from our study may help bring to life the relationship between our meta-emotion variables and our parenting variables . When we first began collecting our data in 1986 , after looking at our tapes over and over again , we began to see a great deal of unity in the behavior of families . We selected two families that particularly illustrated this unity , and we brought the videotape of these two families to a conference at Vanderbilt University on emotion regulation // in children organized by K. Dodge and J. Garber . We were struck by the fact that these two familes were dramatically different , and they became our prototypes for trying to describe and understand the variation we were seeing in our sample . In teaching their children the Atari game in our laboratory , as the child played the game , one family called attention only to mistakes their child made , and was entirely critical in giving their child feedback . The other family was quite the opposite , acting like a cheerleading section , giving their child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see that their marital conflict discussions paralleled these parent ? child interactions . The positive family discussed the problem of the husband 's failed search for a job with humor and affection , and they viewed the problem as if they were both confronting an outside enemy together . The other family discussed religion : the wife wanted the children to be religious and the husband questioned this . The discussion involved the husband confronting his wife , playing devil 's advocate , putting her on the defensive , and then being critical of her responses to his challenges . There was almost no positive affect in their discussion . In the meta-emotion interview , as you might suspect , the critical family was primarily emotion-dismissing whereas the positive family expressed an emotion-coaching philosophy . f the meta-emotion and parenting variables , taken when the child was 4 ? 5 years old in predicting the child 's peer relations at age 8 . This chapter presents evidence that the meta-emotion variables were related to the quality of children 's interaction with other children . DEVELOPMENTAL STABILITY OF THE MACRO SCALES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduction , we adopted a conservative strategy in examining the child 's peer play . We correlated the MACRO scales of the children at age 5 and at age 8 to assess their stability . Only five codes were stable , and they were summed into two summary codes . The first summary code was called Play Quality , and it was the sum of Connected Interaction , r = .30 , p @#@ .05 , and NonStereotyped Fantasy Play , r = .45 , p @#@ .001 . The second summary code was called Observed Negative Affect , and it was the sum of Negative Parallel Play , r .49 , p @#@ .001 , Noncompliant , r = .36 , p @#@ .01 , and Crying , r = .32 , p - .01 . The developmental stability correlations were 0.49 , p @#@ .001 , for Play Quality , and 0.51 , p @#@ .001 , for Negative Affect . // META-EMOTION CORRELATES OF PEER // Table 9.1 is a summary of the correlations of the meta-emotion codes with these two scales when the child was 8 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child 's play quality at age 8 . The father 's awareness of his own anger was predicted lower levels of observed negative affect when with a best friend at age 8 . The mother 's awareness of the child 's anger predicted lower levels of observed negative affect when with a best friend at age 8 . The mother 's coaching of the child 's sadness predicted better ratings of the child 's peer relations by the teacher at age 8 . PARENTAL INTERACTION AS PREDICTORS // Table 9.2 summarizes the predictions for our three dimensions of parenting and the three outcome variables at age 8 . The dimension of Derogation was signifi- cantly predictive of worse ratings by the teacher of the child 's peer relations at age 8 , and more observed negative affect when the child was playing with a best friend at age 8. // Parenting , Parental Meta-Emotions , and the Physical Health and Negative Affectivity of Children In this chapter we explore the predictive validity of the meta-emotion and parenting variables , taken when the child was 4 to 5 years old in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age 8 . META-EMOTION , CHILD NEGATIVE AFFECTIVITY , AND CHILD PHYSICAL // Table 10.1 is a summary of the relationships between the parents ' meta-emotions when the child is 5 years old , and the child 's negative affectivity ( sum of teacher and mothers ratings ) and physical illness when the child was 8 years old . The meta-emotion variables , particularly the mother 's , seem to be strongly related to lower levels of the child 's physical illness . The meta-emotion variables are weakly related to the child 's negative affectivity , with only the father 's awareness of the child 's sadness a significant predictor . PARENTING AND CHILD NEGATIVE AFFECTIVITY , AND CHILD PHYSICAL // Table 10.2 is a summary of the correlations between our three parenting dimensions when the child was 5 years old , the teacher and the child 's negative // affectivity , and physical illness when the child was 8 years old . As can be seen from this table , the two parenting dimensions Derogation and Scaffolding/ Praising were significant predictors of child negative affectivity , but not of child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ELICITED FACIAL EXPRESSIONS WHILE VIEWING EMOTION-ELICITING FILMS Table 10.3 summarizes the correlations between the number and type of facial expressions shown during the viewing of the emotion-eliciting films . This task is a good measure of the amount of positive or negative affectivity that children display spontaneously while viewing films designed to elicit emotion . As can be seen from this table , Derogation was related to increased facial expressiveness , particularly of anger , disgust , and sadness . It was also related to more happy facial expressions . Scaffolding/Praising parenting was related to fewer disgust and sadness facial expressions . Warmth was unrelated to facial expressiveness on this task . Because this developmental period is concerned with the down regulation of emotional expressiveness ( see Maccoby , 1980 ) , these results suggest that children whose parents are more negative and less positive are somewhat delayed in mastering this skill of inhibition . Parenting , Parental Meta-Emotions , and Children 's Academic Achievement at Age 8 In this chapter we explore the predictive validity of the meta-emotion and parenting variables , taken when the child was 4 ? 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and attentional abilities at age 8 . META-EMOTION AND ACADEMIC // Table 11.1 is a summary of the relationships between the meta-emotion variables and academic achievement in mathematics and reading comprehension and the Stroop Interference Test . The child 's mathematics scores were significantly predicted by the mother 's awareness of her own sadness . The child 's reading comprehension scores were predicted by the father 's coaching of the child 's anger . The mother 's awareness of her own sadness was related to good scores on the Stroop Interference test , widely used as a measure of attention deficit disorder and impulsivity ( e.g. , DeHaas &; Young , 1984 ) . THE META-EMOTION PREDICTORS OF CHILD ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT AT // CHILD INTELLIGENCE If , as we hypothesize , the meta-emotion variables affect school achievement through emotion regulation , we should expect that the relationships between the // meta-emotion variables and the child 's achievement at age 8 will hold even , controlling the child 's time-1 IQ at age 5 . To test this hypothesis , we performed a regression analysis forcing in the three IQ scales ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scores ) before entering the mother 's awareness of her own sadness in predicting the child 's math scores , and in a second analysis before entering the father 's coaching of the child 's anger . The F-ratio for change were computed , as well as the partial correlations . For the prediction of the child 's mathematics scores from the mother 's awareness of her own sadness , the F-ratio for change was F ( 4 , 48 ) = 6.12 , p @#@ .05 ( partial correlation = 0.34 ) . For the prediction of the child 's reading comprehension scores from the father 's coaching of the child 's anger , the F-ratio for change was F ( 4 , 44 ) = 9.41 , p @#@ . O1 ( partial correlation = 0.37 ) . For the prediction of the child 's total score from both the mother 's awareness of her own sadness and the father 's coaching of the child 's anger , the two variables were summed for the analysis ; the F-ratio for change was F ( 4 , 45 ) = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . ' PARENTING AND ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT In this section we explore the relationship between our parenting codes and academic achievement . Parental Intrusiveness , Criticism , and Mockery The relationships between the KEACS codes and the child 's academic achievement at age 8 is summarized in Table 11.2 . The father 's criticism of the child at age 5 predicted lower attentional abilities at age 8 , but , surprisingly , the father 's mockery of his child at age 5 predicted higher attentional abilities at age 8 . The mother 's criticism of the child at age 5 predicted lower attentional abilities at age 8 . The father 's intrusiveness at age 5 predicted lower reading and mathematics achievement at age 8 and lower attentional abilities . The mother 's intrusiveness at age 5 predicted lower attentional abilities at age 8 . Parental Warmth and Coldness The relationships between the warmth and coldness Cowan Coding System of the parent ? child interaction when the child was 5 years old and the child 's achievement and attentional skills when the child was 8 years old are presented in Table 11.3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child , and the warmth between father and mother were significantly predictive of the child 's reading comprehension scores . Scaffolding/Praising Parenting ' fable 11.3 also presents the summary of the Scaffolding/Praising parenting variable and the child academic achievement variables . Scaffolding/Praising ' // parenting is positively correlated with both mathematics and reading comprehension scores . COMBINING PARENTING AND META-EMOTION IN PREDICTING ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT Regressions were performed to assess the ability of the parenting and metaemotion variables , taken together , to predict academic achievement and attentional abilities . For mathematics scores , when the meta-emotion variable ( mother 's own sadness awareness ) was first stepped in to the regression , F ( 1 , 50 ) = 9.44 , p @#@ .01 , and when the parenting variables were added , the F-ratio for change was not significant , F ( 3 , 48 ) = 0.86 . For reading comprehension scores , when the meta-emotion variable ( father 's coaching of the child 's anger ) was first stepped in to the regression , F ( 1 , 39 ) = 4.95 , p @#@ .05 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for change was significant , F ( 4 , 36 ) = 4.45 , p ( ( .01 . For the Stroop scores , when the meta-emotion variable ( mother own sadness awareness ) was first stepped into the regression , F ( 1 , 49 ) = 4.57 , p @#@ .05 , and when the parenting variables were added , the F-ratio for change was significant , F ( 2 , 48 ) = 4.14 , p @#@ .05 . The multiple R 's were 0.44 for mathematics , 0.59 for reading comprehension , and 0.40 for the Stroop scores . These analyses suggest that some portion of the variance in academic achievement and attentional abilities was predicted by parenting and meta-emotion variables , and that the meta-emotion variables , although related to these parenting dimensions , // are also providing separate new information in the prediction of mathematics achievement . DISCUSSION Ginott said that when parents are intrusive , or mock and criticize their child when they are teaching the child something new , they are establishing in the child the idea that the child is inadequate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live up to their negative image . Our data seem to bear this out . The derison parenting variable was related to lower scores on mathematics , reading comprehension , and the Stroop attentional abilities scores . The amount of warmth during a teaching ? learning transaction by mothers was predictive of higher reading comprehension scores . Thus , maternal warmth has some , albeit weak , relationship to later achievement by the child . Also the Scaffolding/Praising parenting variable was significantly related to both mathematics and reading comprehension scores . Ginott would not be surprised that the meta-emotion codes were also related to later achievement , and , taken together , that parenting and meta-emotion codes account for chunks of the variance in later academic achievement and attentional abilities . We intend these analyses of parenting to suggest that meta-emotion codes ( e.g. , coaching the child 's anger ) work within a context of parenting to have their effects . Significant stepwise regressions do not suggest anything different , because a natural covariation between meta-emotion and parenting exists . We have found that our three parenting constructs influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derision hurt the child 's progress . The mother 's warmth and the parents ' Scaffolding/Praising parenting facilitate it . The positive relationship between the father 's mockery of his child and the child 's attentional abilities is puzzling . Perhaps the child has learned the adaptation of tuning out the father and focusing attention is a coping mechanism to avoid the pain of derision by the father . // How Might Meta-Emotions Have Their Effects : Preliminary Tests of Our Theory Now that we know that meta-emotion and parenting variables taken at age 4 or 5 are predictive of child outcomes at age 8 , how might these effects work ? We return to the theory we developed in chapter 5 , operationalize the theory , and test some path models that were derived from the theory . In this chapter , we discuss building path-analytic models that provide the best information available with correlational data about the theory we proposed in chapter 5 , and provide some ideas about how things may work . We are aware of the intrinsic inferential restrictions one must suffer with longitudinal correlational data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do not consider the analyses we present in this chapter to be in the realm of theory testing . However , we do believe that we can receive encouragement or discouragement from these analyses about our theory construction . We can also get ideas for what variables may be suitable for experiments ( see chapter 18 ) . DEVELOPMENTAL OUTCOME VARIABLES REVISISTED For our research , we also selected as both an outcome and a process measure the child 's emotion regulation abilities , as measured with our down regulation scale , which was filled out by parents when the child was 8 years old . We selected the following outcome variables at age 8 : ( a ) the child 's academic achievement , which is the sum of mathematics and reading comprehension scores , ( CAHIlFV ( h ) the child 's Down Regulation score on the Katz ? Gottman Emotion Regulation Scale , ( ( ' REGUL , ) , ( c ) the child 's negative affect , which is the sum of the moth // er 's CBCL total score , the teachers CABI total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's negative daily moods on the Differential Emotions Scale , ( CAFFECT ) , ( d ) the sum of the teacher 's rating of negative peer interaction on the CABI , the teacher 's rating of antisocial behavior on the CABI , and the teacher 's ratings of aggression on the Dodge scales , ( CPEER ) , ( e ) the scale we called Observed Negative Affect , which was the sum of Negative Parallel Play , Noncompliant , and Crying , ( NEGAFF8 ) , and ( f ) the Child Illness Questionnaire at age 8 ( CMI88 ) . RATIONALE OF THE MODEL BUILDING Why are we building these models at all ? The reason is to build theory about meta-emotion and how it might have its effects . Hence , we built a family psychophysiology laboratory , and we wrote our theory chapter based on the idea that the child 's physiological responses would underly emotion regulation abilities or deficits . We hypothesized that meta-emotion , operating in part through parenting , would significantly affect these physiological variables . That is , we fundamentally believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they are biological , but , instead , we believe that they are malleable , that , in part , parents shape these dimensions of a child 's biological responses through their emotional interactions with the child , beginning in infancy . Ultimately , we believe that these processes do affect child outcome . Developmental Outcomes in the Modeling Recall that there are a small set of developmental outcomes of interest to us , in decreasing order of importance : 1 . The first and most important developmental outcome was the child 's peer relations during middle childhood . The child 's peer relations was calculated from the sum of three teacher rating scales , the Cowan Adaptive Behavior Inventory ( CABI ) negative peer scale , the CABI antisocial scale , and the Dodge Peer Aggression scale ; this variable is called NEGATIVE PEER in our diagrams . We also measure the child 's peer relations using coding of the child 's interaction with a best friend at home at age 8 ; this latter assessment provides an optimal picture of the child 's peer social performance . 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was combined with the development of behavior problems . Child negative affectivity in our study was the sum of three scales , the mother 's child behavior checklist total score , the total teacher score for the CABI , and the mother 's // report on the Differential Emotions Scale , summing all negative moods for the child , at age 8 , is called CHILD NEGATIVE AFFECT in our diagrams . 3 . Third , we selected the child 's physical health . Child Illness was our usual health measure at age 8. 4 . Fourth , we selected the child 's ability to regulate emotion . To assess the child 's emotion regulation abilities , we used the Down-Regulation scale of the Katz ? Gottman Emotional Regulation Questionnaire , assessed when the children were 8 years old . This variable is called DOWN REGULATION in our diagrams . This variable assesses the extent to which the parents have to exert external control the child to reduce the child 's level of activity , negative emotion , inappropriate behavior , and misconduct . Although it is technically an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was measured when the children were 8 years old , the emotion regulation variable appears in every model . 5 . Fifth , we selected the child 's academic achievement . Child achievement was the sum of the mathematics and reading comprehension scores and it is called CHILD ACHIEVEMENT in our diagrams . The Process Variables Testing the statistical significance of these specific pathways is the goal of the modeling . In Fig. 12.1 , we see the major constructs in the models we plan to construct . We are quite limited by our sample size to select very few variables for the modeling , but we also wish to be limited by considerations of parsimony as well . We begin with the task of selecting the process variables for the modeling . We want to select two meta-emotion variables to characterize the family , one based on awareness of the child 's emotions , and one based on coaching of the child 's emotions . We seek to characterize both mother and father with these two variables . This involves some loss of information . We seek one variable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interaction , one variable that assess the child 's emotion regulation abilities , and two variables that characterize the child 's basal vagal tone and the child 's ability to modulate vagal tone in response to challenges presented by events that require organizing one 's self for coordinated action that requires the focusing or redeployment of attention . The basic template for this modeling is provided by Fig. 12.1 . Walking Through the Model : What We Predict We have numbered eight conceptual pathways in Fig. 12.1 that we expect will be significant pathways in our model . We predict that there will be lines ( statistically significant path coefficients ) from the meta-emotion variables to the pat . enting variable , from meta-emotion to the physiological variables , and from parenting to the physiological variables . We also predict that there will be lines connecting the child physiology variables to the child outcome variables . We predict that all these latter path coefficients will be statistically significant , which would suggest that parents do have an effect on relevant child physiology , both through meta-emotion and through parenting , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age 8 . We also predict the physiological variables will predict the emotion regulation variable , and that the regulation and the parenting variables will relate to child outcome . We predict that parenting will have a direct effect on child regulation . There may be direct effects between the meta-emotion variables and the child outcome variables , but , to the extent that this is true , we have not completely succeeded in our theory , because we will not have a mechanism to explain these effects . How to Understand the Results and How to Read the Figures We used the Bentler computer program EQS for all analyses . For a model to fit , we are searching for a set of equations linking variables that produces a chisquare that is not statistically significant . This may come as a surprise for people not familiar with the technique . A significant chi-square would mean that the model did not fit the empirically obtained covariance structure between the variables . We also looked for a Bentler ? Bonnett Normed statistic ( BBN ) that is close to one . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In our figures we adopt a convention of drawing the path coefficients near the lines , and COACH // the z-scores for these path coefficients in parentheses . If a z-score is greater than 1.96 , it is statistically significant at p @#@ .05 . SELECTION AND VALIDATION OF THE PROCESS VARIABLES FOR MODELING In this section , we discuss the selection and validation of a parsimonious reduced set of variables that are theory-driven . We discuss testing the validity of these variables before modeling . There are five categories of variables : ( a ) Metaemotion ; ( b ) Parenting ; ( c ) Child Physiology reflective of emotional regulation ; ( d ) Emotional Regulation ; and ( e ) Child Outcomes . Meta-Emotion In the interest of parsimony , we need to cut down the choice of variables for the modeling , and it is thus necessary to limit the number of meta-emotion variables . We started with 12 variables ( awareness of own emotion , awareness of the child 's emotion , and coaching , for father and mother , and for sadness and anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of 12 , one of which is : ( a ) the sum of parental awareness of the parents ' own emotions and the sum of the parents ' awareness of the child 's emotions , and the other ( b ) the sum of the parental coaching of the child 's emotions . Table 12.1 is a summary of the correlations of these two variables with the meta-emotion variables . These correlations show that the two variables we constructed are related to all the awareness and coaching variables we have been discussing . Parenting For negative parenting we selected our Derogatory parenting variable , which is the sum of the following KEACS codes : the mother and father 's criticism , mockery , and intrusiveness . The composite variable was labeled NEGPAR . The negative parenting variable was significantly correlated with the following parenting variables : mother mockery ( 0.55 , p @#@ .0001 ) , mother criticism , r = .27 , p .05 , mother intrusiveness , r = .63 , p @#@ .001 , father intrusiveness , r = .88 , p .001 , and mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .001 . We were guided in selecting these negative parenting variables by testing the hypothesis that metaemotion has some of its effects on parenting by inhibiting negative parenting behavior , not only by facilitating positive parenting behavior . For positive parenting variables , the sum of the following were selected from the Kahen Engagement and Affect Coding Systems , a variable we have called Scaffolding/Praising . For each parent , the three positive engagement codes con sisted of : ( a ) Engaged , which consisted of parental attention toward the child , ( b ) Responds to Child 's Needs , in which parents responded to a child 's question or complaint , and ( c ) Positive Directiveness , in which parents issued a directive in a positive fashion . For each parent , the two positive affect codes consisted of : ( a ) Affection , which consisted of praise or physical affection , and ( b ) Enthusiasm , which was coded as cheering and excitement at the child 's performance . We omitted the father 's enthusiasm code from this sum , because for the father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Child Regulatory Physiology We recently reported ( Hooven , Gottman , &; Katz , 1995 ) that the child 's physiology was related to the meta-emotion variables . We found that the father 's awareness of his own sadness was related to the child ( at age 5 ) having significantly lower levels of urinary catecholamines , r = ? .36 , p @#@ .05 , and cortisol , r = ? .34 , p @#@ .05 . The mother 's awareness of sadness was related to her child 's higher changes in heart rate variability ( an index of being able to modulate vagal tone ) , r = .31 , p @#@ .05 . The mother 's coaching of the child 's anger was related to the child 's higher vagal tone during hearing a story , r = .43 , p @#@ .001 , to lower baseline heart rate , r = ? .30 , p @#@ .05 , to higher baseline heart rate variability , r = .31 , p @#@ .05 , and to lower baseline skin conductance level , r = ? .37 , p @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's physiology was related to parental marital quality . In particular , children whose mothers were unhappily married had higher levels of catecholamines in their urine ( Gottman &; Katz , 1989 ) , had higher heart rate reactivity when directed to make a facial expression of emotion ( Shortt , Bush , McCabe , Gottman , &; Katz , 1994 ) , and have slower heart rate recovery following a spontaneous facial expression of anger when watching emotion-eliciting films ( Walker , Wilson , Katz , &; Gottman , in preparation ) .1 Thus , there is a clear link between meta-emotion variables and the child 's physiological reactions in our laboratory , and there is a clear link between the parents ' marriage and the child 's physiological reactions . Our variables are defined in chapter 5 . The variable we call BASE VAGAL in the model is an estimate of the child 's baseline vagal tone . The variable we call DELTA-VAGAL , sometimes abbreviated as DELTA or as DEL , is an estimate of the ability of the child to regulate vagal tone in response to environmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12.2 shows , the vagal tone variables we selected for modeling were related to the child 's lower heart rate ( luring the parent ? child interaction , to the child 's lower resting heart rate during the first visit to the laboratory ( which is a mildly stressful and novel situation ) , to lower baseline skin conductance during the second visit to the laboratory ( after the initial adaptation ) , to higher baseline heart rate variability , and to lower heart rate reactivity in the parent ? child interaction.3 RESULTS OF THE MODELING WITH DEROGATORY PARENTING The Child 's Peer Relations The results of our modeling are presented in Fig. 12.2 . The model fit the data , with X2(13) = 17.95 , p = .159 , BBN = .986 ; R = .62 . Recall that the figures present the path coefficients , with z-scores for each coefficient in parentheses . As can be seen from these figures , the model building using our theory was generally successful . We were able to find linkages for the major pathways we proposed , between meta-emotion and parenting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the physiological variables for child peer relations , between physiology and emotion regulation , between emotion regulation and the child 's peer relations , and between parenting and the child 's peer relations .
