<p> Each week the Gwinnett Extra asks readers to respond to a question of public interest . Last week 's question was : Should kids be able to check out any library books they want to ? <p> Parents bear full onus for protecting their kids <p> I believe that the question should be broken down into two separate questions : 1 ) Should the public library censor books ? 2 ) Should children be protected from harmful books ? <p> The answer to the first question clearly is no . In a democratic society , the free exchange of ideas - including ideas with which we may disagree - is a basic right supported by the Constitution . No special- interest group has the right to demand censorship at the public library . <p> The answer to the second question is yes . However , the responsibility for protecting children from harmful books rest squarely on the shoulders of their parents . The public library should not be pressured by special-interest groups to assume the role of the parent . <p> Let parents accompany kids if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think that kids should be able to check out any book from the library . If a parent is concerned that their child will choose a book that is inappropriate for their maturity level , then the parent should accompany their child to the library . <p> The library is not a babysitter . Going to the library with your child , if you 're uneasy about the book they may choose , is a good way to spark their curiosity and interest , which will lead to the selection of an appropriate book . Parents have different opinions of what children should be reading at certain ages , so it would be unfair for the library to make books unavailable to children . <p> Give kids opportunity to pursue books ' truths <p> By Howard Middleton , Lilburn <p> I say absolutely . Kids should be allowed to pursue the truth any way they wish . They should be able to have access to any library information they want , and to suppress this kind of activity only leads to unhealthy adults . So my answer is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want and find it . <p> The question is what is right for your family <p> By Adie Shimantle , Lithonia <p> Children should be able to check any book in the library as deemed fit by their family ; not by the religious right or by some communistic approach to censoring and banning books . <p> The question should be what is right for your family , and if you raised your children right , then they are going to pick the correct book . It should be a parent 's responsibility and not a legislative decision on what kids should be allowed to read . <p> Public libraries can not represent the views of everyone in society , especially since people possess such varied beliefs . If a parent does n't want a child to check out a book , then do n't let them check it out . I do n't think that any parents ' group should be allowed to tell me how to raise my children . It 's an individual parent 's resonsibility to raise their own children . <p> County has no need for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel children should be able to check out library books with parent or adult supervision . The library is a public place , and children should be supervised . The people who are in charge of choosing books for the library are doing an excellent job , and I do not feel we need a parents ' group to censor the books . I am pleased with the Buford-Sugar Hill library . <p> Any type of censorship always leads to more <p> By Julie Blankenship , Stone Mountain <p> I think children should be able to check out any library book they want . I believe parents either should go with their children to the library and assist them in selecting books . And if that is not possible , they should look at the books their children have checked out when they come home . Then , if the parent has a problem with the selection they can talk to their child about it . <p> I believe that any censoring , no matter how minute it may appear , can only lead to a larger form of censoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right and who 's wrong , how much is right and how much is wrong . Any censoring of this nature is incorrect and is not what the library is all about . I agree with a comment made in the Aug. 9 Gwinnett Extra by Gwinnett-Forsyth Library System Director JoAnn Pinder , who states , " We give them a collection and it 's up to the parent to then choose from it for their children . " She also says , " It is important that parents do n't think about a library as a safe place for their children . This is a public place . " <p> The job of the library system is to provide materials for people . Librarians are not babysitters . They are not moralists . They are there to assist us in obtaining written and audio resources . That is their job . So yes , children should be able to check out any book they like with their parent 's supervision . <p> It 's the parents ' duty to OK or deny books <p> By Louise Stewart , Norcross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ library book they want . If special interests start deciding what books are choosen for the library and which books are not , then we have started down the dangerous road of censorship . <p> All books are n't suitable for certain age kids . It is the job of the parents to monitor the kind of books the child brings home . If the parents have a problem with the type of books being checked out by their kids , then it is up to the parent to explain that to the child in their family 's beliefs . It is not the job of the library or outside group to predetermine what is appropriate for a child because family beliefs and values vary so tremendously . We should not have censorship at the library level and we should not have special interest groups decided which books should be read <p> Any attempt to censor diminishes our rights <p> By Wendy Heffner Wilson , Stone Mountain <p> The freedom to learn is a First Amendment right enjoyed by all citizens , young and old . When any attempt is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promote only those ideas which some approve , our basic right to knowledge and information is in jeopardy . <p> Given the fact that 24 percent of all college-bound students from Gwinnett County are placed in developmental studies classes for reading , English or math , should n't we be encouraging kids to read ? The radical thought police would be scanning every library book for ideas or words to censor or restrict . Censorship is contrary to the goal of education : to foster inquisitive , critical , creative minds . <p> Parents who say they simply want to protect their children from offensive ideas ultimately want to eliminate books from library shelves and impose their narrow views on everyone 's children . Our public libraries have the obligation to serve our entire community with balanced collections , to work against censorship and to avoid any discrimination in the use of its services .
