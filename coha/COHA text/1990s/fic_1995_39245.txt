Everybody knows this , that we pulled in the driveway and I found the hook when I went around to Jill 's door . It was caught in the door handle , hanging there like I do n't know what . I did n't know what it was at first , but when Jill got out she knew , and she started screaming , for which I do n't blame her . Her father came out and made like where had we been and did we know it was almost one o'clock . He 's a good guy , but under real pressure , I guess , since his wife had her troubles . Anyway , he looks at the hook , and then he looks Jill over real good , suspicious-like , like we 'd been up to something , which we definitely had not . We had been , as everybody knows , up at Conversation Point with our debate files , and the time got away from us . I was helping her with her arguments , asking questions , like that , things like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treaty ? " And she would fish around in her file box and try to find an answer . Her one shot at college is the debate team , and their big meet with Northwoods was a week from that Saturday . It was Mr. Royaltuber who called the police , and the word got out . <p> JILL ROYALTUBER <p> It was the scaredest I 've ever been , and when I think of how close that homicidal maniac came to getting us and doing whatever he was going to I do with that big vicious hook , my blood runs cold . Jack was really brave . He wanted to get out of the car after we heard the first noises , the scrapings , and see what it was , but I would n't let him . Sometimes boys just do n't have any sense . We 'd already heard about the escaped homicidal maniac on the radio . They 'd interrupted Wild Johnny Hateras 's Top Twenty Country Countdown with the news bulletin that some one-armed madman had escaped the loony bin on Demon Hill and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Point is right there by the iron fence of the nuthouse . We had gone up to Discussion Point to work through some problems I 'd been having since my mom left , and Jack was talking to me about being strong and saying he 'd be there for me and not to get too depressed and to look on the sunny side of things , that Mom was better off in the hospital  --  she certainly seemed happier . So Jack was being that thing , supportive , which I love . A boyfriend who is captain of football is one thing , and a boyfriend who is captain of football and supportive is another . But I kept him from getting out of the car after we heard the noises . The wind had come up a little and it was dark as dark , and I said , " Let 's just get out of here . " Jack was n't afraid . He wanted to stay . But I told him it was late , and then we heard the scratching closer , against the car , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spine . " Pull out ! " I yelled , and he gunned the engine of his Ford  --  it 's a wonderful car , which he did all the work on  --  and we headed for home . <p> DR . STEWART NARKENPIE , DIRECTOR , THE SPINARD PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE <p> It is not a loony bin . It is not a nuthouse or a funny farm . It 's not even an insane asylum . It is , as I 've been telling everyone in this community for the twenty-two years I 've lived here , the Spinard Psychiatric Institute , a center for the treatment of psychological disorders . It is a medical hospital , the building and grounds of which occupy just under 200 acres on the top of Decatur Hill , and it employs thirty-eight citizens from the lovely town of Griggs , including Mr. Howard Lugdrum , who was injured seriously in last week 's incident . I have spoken to the Rotary Club once a year for forever , as well as to the Lions and the Elks and the Junior Achievement and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Griggs Middle School , explaining what we do and how we do it and that the Spinard Psychiatric Institute is not a loony bin or any other kind of bin , and I am not getting through . It is not a bin ! Even though a large portion of our community has had family and friends enter the Institute as patients only to be returned to the community after treatment in better shape than before , and even though most everybody has visited the grounds  --  if not for personal reasons , then certainly at our annual Community Picnic on the South Lawn  --  there still persists this incurable sense that once you pass under the Spinard stone arch you are entering the twilight zone . Yes , we do have a big iron fence , because some of our patients get confused and could possibly wander away , and yes , the buildings , some of them , have bars over the windows for the safety of our patients , and some of our patients wear restraints when out-of-doors , but they are dangerous to no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am of setting the record straight . It is not a nuthouse , and I am not a mad scientist . We do n't have any mad scientists , mad professors , or mad doctors . No one 's mad . We do n't use that term . We do have some disturbed patients , but we 're treating them , and there is a chance with rest , counseling , and medication  --  that they will get better . We do not perform operations except as they become medically necessary . We had an appendectomy last fall . We do not operate on the brain We do not  --  as the high school paper suggests regularly  --  do brain transplants , dissections , or enlargements . Most recently I had to speak with Wild Johnny Hateras at KGRG , the radio station in Griggs , about the prank news bulletin on Halloween , which is just the kind of thing that keeps any understanding between our Institute and the town in tatters ' and is responsible , I think , for the harm resulting from last Saturday 's incident , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HOWARD LUGDRUM <p> It hurt . Do n't you think that hurt ? Everybody talks about the kids : oh , they were scared , they were frightened and nervous , oh , they were terrified . Well , think about it  --  had two trespassers yanked off their prosthesis ? In the course of doing their job , were either of them . pulled from their feet and dragged till an arm came off , and left there tumbling in the dirt ? As it turns out , I was lucky I was wearing my simple hook and the straps broke ; if I 'd been wearing my regular armature , those two little criminals would have dragged me to death , and we 'd have murder here instead of reckless endangerment . <p> ROD BUDDAROCK <p> If anybody , one person , says anything , one thing , about my buddy Jack Cramble being up there at Passion Point to do anything , one thing , besides help little Jill Royaltuber with family problems , such as they are , I 'll find that person and use his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not joking here . I know Jack from being co-captain of football , and I know what I 'm saying . Of course , he could have come to the team party out at the Landing , but here was a girl who had some troubles , and he was there to help . There 's been a lot of talk about what they were really doing . Jack made that crack about debate , which was too bad , because he could n't get within two miles of the debate team  --  I 'm a better debater than Jill and Jack put together  --  but he only said that to protect Jill 's reputation , such as it is . She 's a nice girl , but a little confused . It was only last year that her mom went bonkers , and Jill herself went a little nuts about that time , but she is no slut . If anybody , one person , says anything about Jill Royaltuber being a wide-mouthed , round-heeled slut , I 'll find that person and trouble will certainly rain down upon his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MR . HOWARD LUGDRUM <p> I 'd seen the car before . It 's a two-door Ford , blue and white . There are five or six cars I see there by our north fence in the pine grove . They bring their girlfriends up from town in the good weather , and we find the empty beer bottles and condoms . The kids call it Passion Point . We had a timed light system there until a few years ago , but the Environmental Protection Agency asked us to dismantle it because of the Weaver 's bat , a protected species that hunts there at night . The deal about the parking is that the grove is our property and we stand liable for any harm . Two kids climb in the backseat of some old clunker with a faulty exhaust and the Institute would be sued until the thirteenth of never . I mean , these are kids at night in old cars . What we 've done is put the grove on the watchman 's tour , and one of us takes the big flashlight and shines it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Until last week , it 's been kind of funny  --  I mean , you see some white rear end hop up , and then the cars start up and wheel out like scurrying rats . Once interrupted , they do n't come back . Until the next night . Like I said , these are kids . <p> I 'm in charge of buildings and grounds at the Institute , and I like my work there ; it 's been a good place to me . <p> SHERIFF CURTIS MANSARACK <p> The most frequently asked question is , " When you bust a beer bust , do you keep the beer ? " For Pete 's sake . Every weekend I roust one or two of these high school beer parties , most often on the hill or down at Ander 's Landing . Sometimes , though , there 'll be a complaint and I 'll be called to a private residence . A lot of these kids know me by now , and they know that about eleven-thirty old Sheriff Mansarack will slip up in his cruiser and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run into the bushes so that I can cite the two or three seniors too drunk to flee . <p> I was in the middle of such a raid last Saturday night , Halloween , a night when I know for a sure fact that there is going to be trouble , and I got the call from Oleena Weenz , our dispatcher . There had been , in her words , a " vicious assault by a pervert , " and she directed me to the address on Eider Street where I found Mr. Rick Royaltuber and the two young people and heard the story . I knew the boy , Jack Cramble , and had seen him play football earlier that night when Griggs beat Bark City , and I was kind of surprised that he was n't down with the rest of the team drinking bee at the Landing . I also knew Mr. Royaltuber , as I had taken the call when his wife went off the deep end a year ago . When a guy helps you subdue his wife and pries her fingers off a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and screaming on your lap on the front porch in front of all the neighbors , you remember him . That was a bad deal , embarrassing for me to get caught off guard . I mean , she looked normal . I had n't seen the scissors . And it was bad for old Royaltuber too , with her shrieking out about him porking what 's her name , the wife of old Dr. Dizzy up at the loony bin , and rattling those scissors at us . Hey , sometimes kitchen tools are the worst . And she was strong . <p> Anyway , I spoke to Mr. Royaltuber and I saw the hook there on the car door . It was a regular artificial arm , straps and all , one of them tom , and it scared me too . I mean , when that thing came off , it had to hurt . I took the report , but it was n't all in line , and to tell the truth neither was the front of the Royaltuber girl 's shirt . She was misbuttoned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurry . <p> The Cramble boy kept at me to get back up there right away before the pervert got somebody else , saying things like , Was n't I the sheriff ? Was n't I supposed to do something ? Well , I could see he wanted to do something , something that had been interrupted up at Passion Point , so I just told them all it was going to be all right , which it was , and I headed back to the Landing , where I was able to run off about ten kids and confiscate a case and a half of Castle Moat , which is not my favorite , but it 'll do . <p> MR . HOWARD LUGDRUM <p> I never married . Years ago , after my accident , I changed my plans about a career in tennis and went up to college near Brippert and got into their vocational-ed program in hotel management . <p> I was pretty numbed out after Cassie 's family moved who knows where . This is a long time ago now . Her girlfriend Maggie Rayne hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think she saw the limits of a man with one hand and moved on . Her father was a professor at the medical school , and I was clearly outclassed . So , anyway , I never married . I did n't realize the torch was still lit  --  or really how alive I could feel  --  until I saw Cassie again a year ago , when she was carried up here kicking and screaming , spitting and cursing , her eyes red and her hair wild , the most beautiful thing I 've seen in , let 's see , seventeen years . <p> MRS . MARGARET RAYNE NARKENPIE <p> I had Rot planned on a mountaintop in Bushville . I had not actual thought that I would  --  after seven years of graduate study and three years at the Highborn Academy  --  find myself banished to the left-hand districts of Farsaken Acres , dressing for dinner at the macaroni-and-cheese outlet , opting for the creamed tuna on special nights . I had lived in the wasteland as a girl , and I thought I was through with it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that marrying the highest-ranking doctor in my father 's finest class , a tall , good-looking psychiatrist of sterling promise who could have written his ticket anywhere in the civilized world , I was expecting to live in a place where there was more than one Quicky Freeze and a Video Hut . I had dared to think London , New York , even Albuquerque . I had not imagined Griggs . No one has imagined Griggs . My husband  --  who has his Institute and his staff and his many duties and all his important vision for psychiatric health care  --  ca n't even see Griggs . So , the way I live here and whom I associate with in this outpost of desolation is , it would seem to me , my business . <p> Mr. Royaltuber handles all the television and monitor maintenance and repair for the Spinard Institute . He has also helped us with the satellite dish and the cable connections we use at home . He 's a nice man , and I have lunch with him from time to time . We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , friends . I met his wife only once , when I was at his home . It was less than pleasant . <p> MR . WILD JOHNNY HATERAS , RADIO PERSONALITY , KGRG <p> If anybody pretends to be hurt or surprised by our little prank , they 're bad actors . Everybody in this burg knows what we do on Halloween with the " important news bulletin " and the hook . We 've been doing it since I started spinning platters here twelve years ago . Nick goes out and slips a dozen of the phony hooks on car doors , and then I interrupt the program with my announcement about the maniac . I think of it as our little annual contribution to birth control ; all those kids jumping up when I cut into " Unchained Melody " with my homicide-and-hook news brief . When we started , we used those plastic hooks from the costume shop in Orpenhook , but , sad to say , gang , it 's impossible to scare anybody anymore with a plastic hook . Do n't tell me the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Bark City , little steel hooks that at least look authentic for a few minutes . But this will probably be the last year we send Nick out with anything at all , because of the trouble up by the nuthouse , and because he 's afraid of getting shot . Can you believe that shit ? You go out on Halloween to have a little fun anymore and you run a good chance of getting plugged ! Hey , Griggs , wake up , all is not well . If you ca n't harass the teenagers without running the risk of getting killed , this town is in trouble . <p> MRS . CASSIE ROYALTUBER <p> It 's funny about what people think . You try to put a pair of kitchen scissors in the doctor 's wife one afternoon and they think a ) you 're crazy , or b ) you 're desperately in love with your sweet husband , or c ) you caught her in bed with your husband , with whom she 's been sleeping for two years , and therefore you 're just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else in this village , which is not exactly full of geniuses , has known about the affair since the first week , or d ) that you 're all three : crazy , in love , and slow to catch on . <p> Well , it is simply exhilarating to be liberated from a ) the slings and b ) the arrows of public opinion and to take it for what it is , which is a ) irrelevant and b ) as absolutely wrong as it can be . <p> Who in their right mind  --  which is where I find myself  --  would consider that the television repairman 's wife might have another reason ! Who would grant the past its due , the vast sweeping privilege of history and justice ? Who would guess that a ) I knew Mrs. Narkenpie before she and her doctor moved to Griggs , in fact before she was Mrs. Narkenpie , when she was simply Margaret Rayne , and that b ) she was the prime reason I had been forcibly removed from my one true love so many years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scissors not for the convenience of their being right there in the drawer but because they were appropriate  --  I wanted to cut her the way she cut my Howard . <p> And the things I screamed I screamed on purpose . How are you going to get into the loony bin unless they think you 're loony ? <p> ROD BUDDAROCK <p> What he does is take the beer . This seems to be his only deal as a cop , to drive around on weekends and take beer from kids . And be keeps the beer . Some kids just go ahead and buy his brand , which is the Rocary Red Ale  --  fifteen dollars a case at any Ale and Mail . Is n't there any crime to stop ? How do you get a job like that  --  free car and free beer ? Hey , I 'll sign up . As is , I 'm glad I 'm a senior and out of here next spring . He comes into our Halloween party last Saturday , the same night that there 's a maniac with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slashing at everything in sight , and he busts us , scaring everybody shitless and causing Ardeen Roster to break her nose running away in the bushes , and he writes me a ticket for it . Then , while some monster with one arm has practically taken over the whole town , he takes our beer , and there 's still about three and a half cases of Red Pelican  --  which you have to drive to Orpenhook to even find  --  so I 'm forced to live the rest of my life picturing this civic wart pounding down our Pelicans every afternoon on his deck while he dreams up his next law enforcement strategy . Life is hard on the young , man , count on it . <p> MR . HOWARD LUGDRUM <p> I 'm going to need to get my hook back . There 's a lot of work up here that requires two hands . We 've got leaves to rake , tons , and a lot of other seasonal preventive maintenance  --  storm windows , snowplow prep work  --  and I ca n't load and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its return as soon as possible . <p> MR . RICK ROYALTUBER <p> Cassie was never even cranky all these years . I mean , of all people , she 's the last I 'd expect to crack up . It was tough to send her off . It hurt me to put her up on the hill , but there it was , we could n't deny she 'd lost control of her senses when she tried to harm Mrs. Narkenpie . How do you think I feel knowing she 's up there , locked up in a nuthouse night and day , wearing a straitjacket or what have you . But the doctor said it was for the best , and I believe him . These things , so many of them , are beyond ordinary folks . <p> SHERIFF CURTIS MANSARACK <p> Incidental to my call on the Royaltubers ' Halloween night , I had the Cramble boy pop open his trunk , and I found the following : <p> nylon rope , 100 yards <p> hammer <p> hatchet <p> power screwdriver <p> small grappling hook <p> duct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> flashlights , two <p> pepper spray , two canisters <p> bolt cutters <p> Doritos , large bag , taco-flavored <p> JILL ROYALTUBER <p> I never saw his face . I never saw anything really . All I heard was some vibrations , I guess  --  maybe footsteps in the leaves , and then a kind of metallic clicking like scritch , scritch , and I was begging lack to pull out , to just pull out of there . We had n't been doing anything . Jack had hurt his hand in the game against Bark City , and I had been massaging that We were trying to relax . <p> MRS . CASSIE ROYALTUBER <p> I loved Howard from Moment Number One , when we met seventeen years ago , on the right of the construction of our high school 's homecoming float , which was a big ram . We were the Cragview Rams . He and I were part of the tissue brigade , two dozen kids handing Kleenex each to each in a line that ended at the chicken-wire sculpture , which slowly filled with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing next to me and our hands touched once a second as the tissue flowed through us , my left hand , his right hand , which he would lose that spring , touch , touch , touch . He was the first tender boy I ever knew , and I was happy when he invited me to the homecoming dance . There is no need to explain every delicate step of that fall , Moment Number Two and Moment Number Three , except to say that when we gave our hearts , we gave our hear completely , and everything else followed . It was the year I died and went to heaven for a while . <p> Moment Number Four I discovered that I was pregnant , and even that seemed magical , until my father found out thanks to my jealous classmate , wicked Maggie Rayne , who also told him that Howard and I always met after school in the Knopdish junkyard . And it was there , during Moment Number Five , that my father found us in the rear seat of an old VW van @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he yanked me out onto the ground and slammed that rusty door forever , or so I thought , on my one good thing  --  Howard Lugdrum . <p> Howard , I heard , lost his arm in the " accident , " and my father moved us far away , here to Griggs . The Moments now go unnumbered . Before the summer was over , young , handsome Ricky Royaltuber was coming round , and I did n't care , I did my part . I was n't even there , and I guess I 've been away a long time . <p> I did n't care when Maggie Rayne moved to town with her fancy doctor , and I did n't care that she went after and got Ricky . It freed me in a way . I can hardly remember who came and went in our house  --  Jill 's friends , neighbors , boys . <p> But when I heard that the stars had relented and uncrossed and again lined up my way , that Howard had come to Griggs , working at this very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , and in a major way . Afternoons , he comes in with a cup of tea , and we sit and he lets me hold it while we talk . These . days are sweet days again , full of sweet moments . <p> Even now I can see him through these bars , cleaning the windows of the van with the big circles of his left hand . <p> JACK CRAMBLE <p> I do n't care who knows it now : I was going to spring her . Last year , when I was a nobody from nowhere , she was the only person in town who would listen . I was the new kid in town then , not captain of the football team , and she was always there for me . I told her everything . It was easier and better than talking to my own folks , and she was different , a woman , more woman than anybody I 'll ever meet again . I loved her and I loved the way she talked , putting my problems in perspective a , b @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To keep seeing her I started dating that dipweed Jill , who has been nothing but a pain in the neck with all her " sharing , " " caring , " and " daring . " Such a girl . Such a needy little girl . lust thinking about her makes my skin crawl . Let 's go up to the Point , she 'd say , so she could crawl all over me . I 'll tell you flat , she knows nothing about being a real woman like her mother . We went up there on Halloween after the game so I could scope out the fence and the approach to Cassie 's room . The plan was for midnight . Of course , Jill jumped me when we parked , and lucky for me the watchman came along or I 'd have had to go all the way . As it was , her pants were already to her ankles , and he got a hell of a view of her bare ass in the window . <p> But it has n't deterred me . Cassie and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , regardless of the age difference . I 'm going back up there in a night or two and busting her out . Football season 's over , and it 's time to be me . My heart knows what to do , and it says , Scale the wall , break her out ! <p> MR . HOWARD LUGDRUM <p> She was here almost a year before she told me . Though I knew instantly we 'd pick up where we left off , my heart steady through the years to the one woman I loved , Cassie waited to be sure it was still me , I guess , that a man with one arm could be trusted . <p> So last week we were at tea in her room after her counseling session , and she looked at me funny and told me something amazing : I have a daughter ! A daughter ! Having Cassie back in my life after so long seemed almost too much for me to bear , and now ... a child . Well , not a child but a young woman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I went by the north pine grove sometime after nine that night , Halloween . I 'd see a blue and white Ford and my daughter would be in it ! It was all I could do to get the afternoon hours out of the way ; it was a waiting like no waiting I have ever known . My daughter ! As it happened , I do n't know if I saw her or not , just somebody 's butt in the moonlight . <p> SHERIFF CURTIS MANSARACK <p> Fall in Griggs is a good thing : the leaves change color and there 's football and the smell of the first woodfires . Halloween 's my last big chance to score a beer bust , and I almost never miss . I did n't miss this year . Every year there 's a hook , sometimes more than one , and it takes a week or two for things to quiet down . I do n't mind the hooks ; the waxed windows are worse . I 'd trade the waxed windows for two more hooks . Soon it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no cop better than old Jack Frost . <p> PERSON BEHIND LAST TREE IN THE TWILIGHT <p> At night , as I drift through these woods , I tap my hook from time to time against my leg and the feel of the hard iron spurs me on past fence and fern , past drooping branches and the cobbed underbrush . What I need is an older model American car parked alone in the dark , one with a grip handle that I can snare . The lift handles are no good , and everything anymore has the aerodynamic lift handles . I want a ' 60 Fairlane or a ' 58 Chevrolet , a car with bench seats big enough for two young people to get comfortable and tangle up their clothing and their brainwaves so that they forget the dark , the woods , the person with a hook , every Halloween , approaching through the leaves . <p> Ron Carlson is the author of the short-story collection Plan B for the Middle Class ( Norton ) .
