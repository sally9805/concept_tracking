<p> Attorneys for Oklahoma City bombing suspect Timothy McVeigh plan to argue that someone other than their client committed the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil . <p> When his trial finally begins March 31 , they 'll also contend the FBI mishandled evidence , that witnesses mistakenly picked McVeigh out of photo lineups and confused him with other suspects , and two key witnesses lied to protect themselves . <p> Although U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch has barred attorneys from talking about the case , a clear picture of McVeigh 's defense in the bombing that killed 168 people and injured more than 500 others has emerged from hearings and court records . <p> " We certainly will contend that there is a John Doe 2 , and maybe 3 , 4 and 5 , there are multiple Ryder trucks , and that our client is not guilty , " defense attorney Stephen Jones said during a hearing Nov. 13 . <p> The government alleges McVeigh rented the Ryder truck that carried the bomb on the afternoon of April 17 , 1995 , and he and codefendant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But The Denver Post last weekend reported there had been reports of multiple Ryder truck sightings . The paper quoted witnesses who placed a Ryder truck at Geary State Fishing Lake in Kansas on April 10 , 1995 , and on April 18 , 1995 , the day before the bombing . <p> The Post , which published a seven-page account Sunday of its six-month investigation of the bombing case , said neither McVeigh nor Nichols could have driven the truck to the lake April 10 . <p> The Post 's investigation concluded that there had to be additional participants in the bombing because at the time the mysterious Ryder truck showed up at Geary State Fishing Lake near Junction City , Kan. , McVeigh was holed up in a resident hotel in Kingman , Ariz. ; Nichols was returning from a gun show in Michigan ; and government witness Michael Fortier also was not in Kansas . <p> McVeigh 's attorney Jones has identified five major tenets of his defense , including the mistaken eyewitness identification of McVeigh at Junction City , where the truck was rented ; forensic evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lies by key witnesses Michael and Lori Fortier . <p> Interviews and research into the case by The Associated Press also show he will offer alternative reasons why McVeigh was in Oklahoma after the bombing , and rebut the government 's contention the attack was carried out in retaliation for the siege and deaths at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco , Texas . <p> The " proximity issue " is the most difficult item for McVeigh 's defense team . Why was McVeigh in the vicinity after the bombing ? <p> Jones has refused to provide an explanation over the past two years , hinting he wants to save that explanation for the jury . But defense attorneys have also noted McVeigh had a gun when he was arrested 80 miles north of Oklahoma City , about 90 minutes after the bombing . <p> If McVeigh had just killed 168 people , they reason , why did n't he shoot the trooper ? <p> Another strong part of the government 's case is the allegation McVeigh carried out the bombing in retaliation for the government 's deadly siege at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antigovernment pamphlets and books from the two suspects , and may introduce videotapes of McVeigh taken at Waco during the seige . <p> But Jones argued that if that 's a violation , the actions of America 's founding fathers should be suspect . Jones says McVeigh has First Amendment rights just like anyone else to criticize the government , and that 's not proof his client went out and killed 168 people for revenge . <p> According to prosecution documents , the government hopes to prove that McVeigh and Nichols hatched the plot at least seven months before the bombing . Prosecutors allege firearms were stolen to finance the bombing , and the two men began assembling components , stolen during a burglary at a Kansas quarry , for their device in September 1994 . <p> McVeigh , 28 , and Nichols , 41 , are charged with 11 counts , including use of weapons of mass destruction , destruction of federal property and killing of federal law enforcement officers in the April 19 , 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah building . They could get the death penalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built the bomb on Tuesday , April 18 , 1995 , at Geary State Fishing Lake . <p> Eyewitness reports indicated a yellow Ryder truck was parked next to a dark blue or brown truck with a white camper shell for most of the day . Prosecutors plan to offer Nichols ' statements that he met McVeigh in Junction City that day and loaned McVeigh his dark blue pickup with a white camper shell . <p> But the eyewitnesses conflict over what day they saw the truck , some saying it was the week before . None of the eyewitnesses say they saw McVeigh and Nichols there , and their description of the truck with a camper shell differs . <p> The first Ryder truck was spotted at the lake on April 10 , the Post reported . <p> " I thought it was kind of weird , that Ryder truck being in there . But I figured it was someone moving cross-country and they 'd pulled off to get some sleep , " Army Sgt. James Sargent told the newspaper . <p> He said he saw the truck that afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going fishing . <p> Another potential weakness in the government 's case that McVeigh 's defense team is expected to exploit is the diverging description of the man who rented the Ryder truck on April 17 at Elliott 's Body Shop in Junction City , Kan . The truck was rented to a Robert Kling , but the description given by witnesses does not match McVeigh , although McVeigh used Kling 's identity . <p> The witnesses indicated Kling was 5 feet 10 inches , and weighed about 180 pounds . Tom Kessinger went further and indicated Kling had a rough complexion . Defense attorneys have pointed out that McVeigh has blue eyes , weighed 160 pounds , stood 6-feet-2 and has a clear complexion . <p> Daina Bradley Bruce , who lost two children and her mother as well as a leg in the bombing , told authorities that before the bomb went off , she saw a man who fit the description of another suspect identified only as John Doe No. 2 getting out of a Ryder truck shortly before the blast , and it was n't McVeigh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she has no motive to want to help McVeigh . <p> Prosecutors have acknowledged " others " may have been involved , and say they are continuing their investigation . Police have a sketch of the man identified as John Doe No. 2 , but have been unable to locate him in the two years since the bombing . <p> Authorities are relying on testimony from Michael Fortier , a former Army buddy of McVeigh and Nichols . Authorities admit Fortier initially lied to them . He also admitted using illegal drugs , according to a letter to defense attorneys from prosecutors . <p> Fortier has pleaded guilty to federal charges that include failing to tell authorities what he knew about the plot before it was carried out . He faces a 23-year sentence . <p> Defense attorneys say police would not have made a plea-bargain with Fortier on charges related to a case in which 168 people were killed unless they needed Fortier 's testimony against McVeigh and Nichols . <p> Prosecutors allege McVeigh and Nichols bought 40 fifty-pound bags of ammonium nitrate - the fertilizer believed used in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kan. , on Sept. 30 and again on Oct. 19 , 1994 , both times using the alias " Mike Havens . " <p> Authorities point to evidence of explosives found on McVeigh 's clothing , linking him to the bomb , but an FBI expert witness , Dr. Frederic Whitehurst , said the FBI lab was contaminated . Of course they found explosives residue - the lab was full of it , defense attorneys say . <p> Jones has called Whitehurst 's allegations " a ticking time bomb " in the case .
