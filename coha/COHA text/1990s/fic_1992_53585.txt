MAT FELTNER WAS MY GRANDFATHER on my mother 's side . Saying it thus , I force myself to reckon again with the strangeness of that verb was . The man of whom I once was pleased to say , " He is my grandfather , " has become the dead man who was my grandfather . He was , and is no more . And this is a part of the great mystery that we call time . <p> But the past is present also . And this , I think , is a part of the greater mystery we call eternity . Though Mat Feltner has been dead for twenty-five years and I am now older than he was when I was born and have grandchildren of my own , I know his hands , their way of holding a hammer or a hoe or a set of checklines , as well as I know my own . I know his way of talking , his way of cocking his head when he began a story , the smoking pipe stem held an inch from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a memory but as a consolation , his welcome to me when I returned home from the university and , later , from jobs in distant cities . When I sat down beside him , his hand would clap lightly onto my leg above the knee ; my absence might have lasted many months , but he would say as though we had been together the day before , " Hello , Andy . " The shape of his hand is printed on the flesh of my thigh as vividly as a birthmark . This man who was my grandfather is present in me , as I felt always his father to be present in him . His father was Ben . The known history of the Feltners in Port William begins with Ben . <p> But even the unknown past is present in us , its silence as persistent as a ringing in the ears . When I stand in the road that passes through Port William , I am standing on the strata of my history that go down through the known past into the unknown : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravel , which rests on the creek rock and cinders laid down by the town when it was still mostly beyond the reach of the county ; and under the creek rock and cinders is the dirt track of the town 's beginning , the buffalo trace that was the way we came . You work your way down , or not so much down as within , into the interior of the present , until finally you come to that beginning in which all things , the world and the light itself , at a word welled up into being out of their absence . And nothing is here that we are beyond the reach of merely because we do not know about it . It is always the first morning of Creation and always the last day , always the now that is in time and the now that is not , that has filled time with reminders of itself . <p> When my grandfather was dying , I was not thinking about the past . My grandfather was still a man I knew , but as he subsided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had known . I was experiencing consciously for the first time that transformation in which the living , by dying , pass into the living , and I was full of grief and love and wonder . <p> And so when I came out of the house one morning after breakfast and found Braymer Hardy sitting in his pickup truck in front of my barn , I was n't expecting any news . Braymer was an old friend of my father 's ; he was curious to see what Flora and I would do with the long-abandoned Harford Place that we had bought and were fixing up , and sometimes he visited . His way was not to go to the door and knock . He just drove in and stopped his old truck at the barn and sat looking around until somebody showed up . <p> " Well , you ai n't much of a Catlett , " he said , in perfect good humor . " Marce Catlett would have been out and gone two hours ago . " <p> " I do my chores before breakfast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My grandfather Catlett would , in fact , have been out and gone two hours ago . <p> " But , " Braymer said in an explanatory tone , as if talking to himself , " I reckon your daddy is a late sleeper , being as he 's an office man . But that Wheeler was always a shotgun once he got out , " he went on , clearly implying , and still in excellent humor , that the family line had reached its nadir in me . " But maybe you 're a right smart occupied of a night , I do n't know . " He raked a large cud of tobacco out of his cheek with his forefinger and spat . <p> He looked around with the air of a man completing an inspection , which is exactly what he was doing . " Well , it looks like you 're making a little headway . You got it looking some better . Here , " he said , pawing among a litter of paper , tools , and other odds and ends on top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I brought you something . " He eventually forcepped forth an old newspaper page folded into a tight rectangle the size of a wallet and handed it through the truck window . " You ought to have it . It ai n't no good to me . The madam , you know , is hell for an antique . She bought an old desk at a sale , and that was in one of the drawers . " <p> I unfolded the paper and read the headline : BEN FELTNER , FRIEND TO ALL , SHOT DEAD IN PORT WILLIAM . <p> " Ben Feltner was your great-granddaddy . " <p> " Yes . I know . " <p> " I remember him . He was fine as they come . They never made ' em no finer . The last man on earth you 'd a thought would get shot . " <p> " So I 've heard . " <p> " Thad Coulter was a good kind of feller , too , far as that goes . I do n't reckon he was the kind you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He pushed his hat back and scratched his forehead . " One of them things , " he said . " They happen . " <p> He scratched his head some more and propped his wrist on top of the steering wheel , letting the hand dangle . " Tell you , " he said , " there ai n't a way in this world to know what a human creature is going to do next . I loaned a feller five hundred dollars once . He was a good feller , too , was n't a thing wrong with him far as I knew , I liked him . And dogged if he did n't kill himself ' fore it was a week . " <p> " Killed himself , " I said . <p> " Killed himself , " Braymer said . He meditated a moment , looking off at his memory of the fellow and wiggling two of the fingers that hung over the steering wheel . " Do n't you know , " he said , " not wishing him no bad luck , but I wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> I laughed . <p> " Well , " he said , " I know you want to be at work . I 'll get out of your way . " <p> I said , " Do n't be in a hurry , " but he was starting the truck and did n't hear me . I called , " Thanks ! " as he backed around . He raised his hand , not looking at me , and drove away , steering with both hands , with large deliberate motions , as if the truck were the size of a towboat . <p> There was an upturned feed bucket just inside the barn door . I sat down on it and unfolded the paper again . It was the front page of the Hargrave Weekly Express , flimsy and yellow , nearly illegible in some of the creases . It told how , on a Saturday morning in July of 1912 , Ben Feltner , who so far as was known had had no enemies , had been killed by a single shot to the head from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said , upon turning himself in to the sheriff at Hargrave soon after the incident , " I 've killed the best friend I ever had . " It was not a long article . It told about the interment of Ben Feltner and named his survivors . It told nothing that I did not know , and I knew little more than it told . I knew that Thad Coulter had killed himself in jail , shortly after the murder . And I knew that he was my grandfather Catlett 's first cousin . <p> I had learned that much not from anyone 's attempt , ever , to tell me the story , but from bits and pieces dropped out of conversations among my elders , in and out of the family . Once , for instance , I heard my mother say to my father that she had always been troubled by the thought of Thad Coulter 's lonely anguish as he prepared to kill himself in the Hargrave jail . I had learned what I knew , the bare outline of the event , without asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story and honoring the silence that surrounded the pain . <p> But sitting in the barn that morning , looking at the old page opened on my knees , I saw how incomplete the story was as the article told it , and as I knew it . And seeing it so , I felt incomplete myself . I suddenly wanted to go and see my grandfather . I did not intend to question him . I had never heard him speak so much as a word about his father 's death , and I could not have imagined breaking his silence . I only wanted to be in his presence , as if in his presence I could somehow enter into the presence of an agony that I knew had shaped us all . <p> With the paper folded again in my shirt pocket , I drove the two miles to Port William and turned in under the old maples beside the house . When I let myself in , the house was quiet , and I went as quietly as I could to my grandfather 's room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his fingers laced together on top of the bedclothes . He had seen me drive in , and was watching the door when I entered the room . <p> " Morning , " I said . <p> He said , " Morning , son , " and lifted one of his hands . <p> " How 're you feeling ? " <p> " Still feeling . " <p> I sat down in the rocker by the bed and told him , in Braymer 's words , the story of the too-late suicide . <p> My grandfather laughed . " I expect that grieved Braymer . " <p> " Is Braymer pretty tight ? " I asked , knowing he was . <p> " I would n't say ' tight , ' but he 'd know the history of every dollar he ever made . Braymer 's done a lot of hard work . " <p> My grandmother had heard us talking , and now she called me . " Oh , Andy ! " <p> " I 'll be back , " I said , and went to see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedroom by the kitchen where she had always done her sewing , and where she slept now that my grandfather was ill . She was sitting by the window in the small cane-bottomed rocking chair that was her favorite . Her hands were lying on her lap and she was not rocking . I knew that her arthritis was hurting her ; otherwise , at that time of day , she would have been busy at something . She had medicine for the arthritis , but it made her feel unlike herself ; up to a certain point of endurability , she preferred the pain . She sat still and let the pain go its way and occupied her mind with thoughts . Or that is what she said she did . I believed , and I was as sure as if she had told me , that when she sat alone that way , hurting or not , she was praying . Though I never heard her pray aloud in my life , it seems to me now that I can reproduce in my mind the very voice of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out things , which was her way . I sat down on the stool in front of her and submitted to examination . She wanted to know what Flora was doing , and what the children were doing , and when I had seen my mother , and what she had been doing . She asked exacting questions that called for much detail in the answers , watching me intently to see that I withheld nothing . She did not tolerate secrets , even the most considerate ones . She had learned that we sometimes omitted or rearranged facts to keep her from worrying , but her objection to that was both principled and passionate . If we were worried , she wanted to worry with us ; it was her place , she said . <p> After a while , she quit asking questions , but continued to look at me . And then she said , " You 're thinking about something you 're not saying . What is it ? Tell Granny . " <p> She had said that to me many times in the thirty years I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was funny . But if I was no longer intimidated , 1 was still compelled . In thirty years I had never been able to deceive her when she was looking straight at me . I could have lied , but she would have known it , and then would have supposed that somebody was sick . I laughed and handed her the paper out of my pocket . <p> " Braymer Hardy brought that to me this morning . " <p> She unfolded it , read a little of the article , but not all , and folded it back up . Her hands lay quiet in her lap again , and she looked out the window , though obviously not seeing what was out there that morning . Another morning had come to her , and she was seeing it again through the interval of fifty-three years . <p> " It 's a wonder , " she said , " that Mat did n't kill Thad Coulter that morning . " <p> I said , " Granddad ? " <p> And then she told me the story . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July morning in 1912 . Her hands lay in her lap and never moved . The only effect her telling had on her was a glistening that appeared from time to time in her eyes . She told the story well , giving many details . She had a good memory , and she had lived many years with her mother-in-law , who also had a good one . I have the impression that they , but not my grandfather , had pondered together over the event many times . She spoke as if she were seeing it all happen , even the parts of it that she had not in fact seen . <p> " If it had n't been for Jack Beechum , Mat would have killed him , " my grandmother said . <p> That was the point . Or it was one of the points  --  the one , perhaps , that she most wanted me to see . But it was not the beginning of the story . Adam and Eve and then Cain and Abel began it , as my grandmother depended on me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story , the beginning was some years earlier than July of 1912 . <p> Abner Coulter , Thad 's only son , had hired himself out to a grocer in Hargrave . After a few years , when he had ( in his own estimation ) learned the trade , he undertook to go into business for himself in competition with his former employer . He rented a building right on the courthouse square . He was enabled to do this by a sizable sum of money borrowed from the Hargrave bank on a note secured by a mortgage on his father 's farm . <p> And here Thad 's character enters into the story . For Thad not only secured his son 's note with the farm that was all he had in the world , and that he had only recently finished paying for , but he further committed himself by bragging in Port William of his son 's new status as a merchant in the county seat . <p> " Thad Coulter was not a bad man , " my grandmother said . " I believed then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad man . But we are all as little children . Some know it and some do n't . " <p> She looked at me to see if I was one who knew it , and I nodded , but I was thirty then and did not know it yet . <p> " He was as a little child , " she said , " and he was in serious trouble . " <p> He had in effect given his life and its entire effort as hostage to the possibility that Abner , his only son , could be made a merchant in a better place than Port William . <p> Before two years were out , Abner repaid his father 's confidence by converting many small private fritterings and derelictions into an undisguisable public failure , and thereupon by riding off to somewhere unknown on the back of a bay gelding borrowed ostensibly for an overnight trip to Port William . And so Thad 's fate was passed from the reckless care of his son to the small mercy of the law . Without more help than he could confidently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even with help , he was going to have to pay for it again , and he was close to sixty years old . <p> As he rode home from his interview with the Hargrave banker , in which the writing on the wall had been made plain to him , he was gouging his heel urgently into the mule 's flank . Since he had got up out of the chair in the banker 's office , he had been full of a desire as compelling as thirst to get home , to get stopped , to get low to the ground , as if to prevent himself from falling off the world . For the country that he had known all his life and had depended on , at least in dry weather , to be solid and steady underfoot , had suddenly risen under him like a wave . <p> Needing help as he did , he could not at first bring himself to ask for it . Instead , he spent most of two days propped against a post in his barn , drinking heavily and talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hargrave bankers , and the poor doings of damned fools , meaning both Abner and himself . And he recalled , with shocks of bitterness that only the whiskey could assuage , his confident words in Port William about Abner and his prospects . <p> " I worked for it , and I come to own it , " he said over and over again . " Now them will own it that never worked for it . And him that stood on it to mount up into the world done run to perdition without a patch , damn him , to cover his ass or a rag to hide his face . " <p> When his wife and daughter begged him to come into the house , he said that a man without the sense to keep a house did not deserve to be in one . He said he would shelter with the dogs and hogs , where he belonged . <p> The logical source of help was Ben Feltner . Ben had helped Thad to buy his farm  --  had signed his note and stood behind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ben ; it may have mattered to him above all . But Thad did not go to Ben until after his second night in the barn . He walked to Ben 's house in Port William early in the morning , drunk and unsteady , his mind tattered and raw from repeated plunges through the thorns and briars of his ruin . <p> Ben was astonished by the look of him . Thad had always been a man who used himself hard , and he had grown gaunt and stooped , his mouth slowly caving in as he lost his teeth . But that morning he was also soiled , sagging , unshaved and uncombed , his eyes bloodshot and glary . Ben said , " Come in , Thad . Come in and sit down . " And he took him by the arm , led him in to a chair , and sat down facing him . <p> " They got me , Ben , " Thad said , the flesh twitching around his eyes . " They done got me to where I ca n't get loose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he made as much sense of his calamity as he was able to make : " A poor man do n't stand no show . " And then , his mind lurching on , unable to stop , he fell to cursing , first Abner , and then the Hargrave bank , and then the ways of the world that afforded no show to a poor man . <p> Ben listened to it all , sitting with his elbow on the chair arm and his forefinger pointed against his cheek . Thad 's language and his ranting in that place would not have been excusable had he been sober . But insofar as Thad was drunk , Ben was patient . He listened attentively , his eyes on Thad 's face , except that from time to time he looked down at his beard as if to give Thad an opportunity to see that he should stop . <p> Finally Ben stopped him . " Thad , I 'll tell you what . I do n't believe I can talk with you any more this morning . Go home , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll see . " <p> Thad did not have to take Ben 's words as an insult . But in his circumstances and condition , it was perhaps inevitable that he would . That Ben was his friend made the offense worse  --  far worse . In refusing to talk to him as he was , Ben , it seemed to Thad , had exiled him from the society of human beings , had withdrawn the last vestige of a possibility that he might find anywhere a redemption for himself , much less for his forfeited land . For Thad was not able then to distinguish between himself as he was and himself as he might be sober . He saw himself already as a proven fool , fit only for the company of dogs and hogs . If he could have accepted this judgment of himself , then his story would at least have been different , and would perhaps have been better . But while he felt the force and truth of his own judgment , he raged against it . He had fled to Ben , hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine , Ben could release him from the solitary cage of his self-condemnation . And now Ben had shut the door . <p> Thad 's whole face began to twitch and his hands to move aimlessly , as if his body were being manipulated from the inside by some intention that he could not control . Patches of white appeared under his whiskers . He said , " I cuss you to your damned face , Ben Feltner , for I have come to you with my hat in my hand and you have spit in it . You have thronged in your lot with them sons of bitches against me . " <p> At that Ben reached his limit . Yet even then he did not become angry . He was a large , unfearful man , and his self-defense had something of merriment in it . He stood up . " Now , Thad , my friend , " he said , " you must go . " And he helped him to the door . He did not do so violently or with excessive force . But though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearty strength , and he helped Thad to the door in such a way that Thad had no choice but to go . <p> But Thad did not go home . He stayed , hovering about the front of the house , for an hour or more . <p> " It seemed like hours and hours that he stayed out there , " my grandmother said . She and my great-grandmother , Nancy , and old Aunt Cass , the cook , had overheard the conversation between Ben and Thad , or had overheard at least Thad 's part of it , and afterward they watched him from the windows , for his fury had left an influence . The house was filled with a quiet that seemed to remember with sorrow the quiet that had been in it before Thad had come . <p> The morning was bright and still , and it was getting hot , but Thad seemed unable to distinguish between sun and shade . There had got to be something fluttery or mothlike about him now , so erratic and unsteady and unceasing were his movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head , his hands making sudden strange motions without apparent reference to whatever he might have been saying . Now and again he started resolutely toward the house and then swerved away . <p> All the while the women watched . To my grandmother , remembering , it seemed that they were surrounded by signs that had not yet revealed their significance . Aunt Cass told her afterward , " I dreamed of the dark , Miss Margaret , all full of the sound of crying , and I knowed it was something bad . " And it seemed to my grandmother , as she remembered , that she too had felt the house and town and the bright day itself all enclosed in that dreamed darkness full of the sounds of crying . <p> Finally , looking out to where the road from upriver came over the rise into town , they saw a team and wagon coming . Presently they recognized Thad Coulter 's team , a pair of mare mules , one black and the other once gray but now faded to white . They were driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun-bleached blue cotton dress , and an apron . <p> " It 's Martha Elizabeth , " Nancy said . <p> And Aunt Cass said , " Poor child . " <p> " Well , " Nancy said , relieved , " she 'll take him home . " <p> When Martha Elizabeth came to where Thad was she stopped the mules and got down . So far as they could see from the house , she did not plead with him ; she did not say anything at all . She took hold of him , turned him toward the wagon , and led him to it . She held onto him as he climbed unsteadily up into the wagon and sat down on the spring seat , and then , gathering her skirts in one hand , she climbed up and sat beside him . And all the while she was gentle with him . Afterward , and always , my grandmother remembered how gentle Martha Elizabeth had been with him . <p> Martha Elizabeth turned the team around , and the Feltner women watched the wagon with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had disappeared , they went back to their housework . <p> Ben , who had meant to go to the field where his hands were at work , did not leave the house as long as Thad was waiting about outside . He saw no point in antagonizing Thad when he did not have to , and so he sat down with a newspaper . <p> When he knew that Thad was gone and out of sight , Ben got up and put on his hat and went out . He was worried about the state both of Thad 's economy and of his mind . He thought he might find some of the other Coulters in town . He did n't know that he would , but it was Saturday , and he probably would . <p> The Feltner house stood , as it still does , in the overlap of the northeast corner of the town and the southwest corner of Ben 's farm . There was a farmstead at each of the town 's four corners . There was , as there still is , only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crossed a mile of ridge , passed through the town , and , after staying on the ridge another half-mile or so , went back down into the valley again . For most of its extent , at that time , it was little more than a wagon track . Most of the goods that reached the Port William merchants still came to the town landing by steamboat and then up the hill by team and wagon . The town itself consisted of perhaps two dozen houses , a church , a blacksmith shop , a bank , a barber shop , a doctor 's office , a hotel , two saloons , and four stores that sold a variety of merchandise from groceries to dry goods to hardware to harness . The road that passed through town was there only as a casual and hardly foreseen result of the comings and goings of the inhabitants . An extemporaneous town government had from time to time caused a few loads of creek rock to be hauled and knapped and spread over it , and the townspeople had flung their ashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never thought of calling itself a street . <p> Though the houses and shops had been connected for some time by telephone lines carried overhead on peeled and whitewashed locust poles , there was as yet not an automobile in the town . There were times in any year still when Port William could not have been reached by an automobile unless that was accompanied by a team of mules to pull it across the creeks and out of the mud holes . <p> Except for the telephone lines , the town , as it looked to Ben Feltner on that July morning seventy-eight years ago , might have been unchanged for many more years than it had existed . It looked older than its history . And yet in Port William , - as everywhere else , it was already the second decade of the twentieth century . And in some of the people of the town and the community surrounding it , one of the characteristic diseases of the twentieth century was making its way : the suspicion that they would be greatly improved if they were someplace else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Thad it was fast coming to crisis . If Port William could not save him , then surely there was another place that could . But Thad could not just leave , as Abner had ; Port William had been too much his life for that . And he was held also by friendship  --  by his friendship for Ben Feltner , and for himself as a man whom Ben Feltner had befriended  --  a friendship that Ben Feltner seemed now to have repudiated and made hateful . Port William was a stumbling block to Thad , and he felt he must rid himself of it somehow . <p> Ben , innocent of the disease that afflicted his friend yet mortally implicated in it and not knowing it , made his way down into the town , looking about in order to gauge its mood  --  for Port William had its moods , and they needed watching . More energy was generated in the community than the work of the community could consume , and the surplus energy often went into fighting . There had been cuttings and shootings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the combatants simply threw whatever projectiles came to hand : corncobs , snowballs , green walnuts , or rocks . In the previous winter , a young Coulter by the name of Burley had claimed that he had had an eye blackened by a frozen horse-turd thrown , so far as he could determine , by a Power of the Air . But the place that morning was quiet . Most of the crops had been laid by and many of the farmers were already in town , feeling at ease and inclined to rest now that their annual battle with the weeds had ended . They were sitting on benches and kegs or squatting on their heels under the shade trees in front of the stores , or standing in pairs or small groups among the hitched horses along the sides of the road . Ben passed among them , greeting them and pausing to talk , enjoying himself , and all the while on the lookout for one or another of the Coulters . <p> Martha Elizabeth was Thad 's youngest , the last at home . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his children , and was the best . Assuming the authority that his partiality granted her , she had at fifteen taken charge of the household , supplanting her mother , who was sickly , and her three older sisters , who had married and gone . At seventeen , she was responsible beyond her years . She was a tall , rawboned girl , with large hands and feet , a red complexion , and hair so red that , in the sun , it appeared to be on fire . <p> " Everybody loved Martha Elizabeth , " my grandmother said . " She was as good as ever was . " <p> To Thad it was a relief to obey her , to climb into the wagon under the pressure of her hand on his arm and to sit beside her as she drove the team homeward through the rising heat of the morning . Her concern for him gave him shelter . Holding to the back of the seat , he kept himself upright and , for the moment , rested in being with her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet narrower road that led down into the valley called Cattle Pen and came into sight of their place , she could no longer shelter him . It had long been , to Thad 's eye , a pretty farm  --  a hundred or so acres of slope and ridge on the west side of the little valley , the lower , gentler slopes divided from the ridge land by a ledgy bluff that was wooded , the log house and other buildings occupying a shelf above the creek bottom . Through all his years of paying for it , he had aspired toward it as toward a Promised Land . To have it , he had worked hard and long and deprived himself , and Rachel , his wife , had deprived herself . He had worked alone more often than not . Abner , as he grew able , had helped , as the girls had , also . But Abner had been reserved for something better . Abner was smart  --  too smart , as Thad and Rachel agreed without ever much talking about it , to spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done to start him on his way to something better , a Promised Land yet more distant . <p> Although he had thought the farm not good enough for Abner , Thad was divided in his mind ; and for himself he loved it . It was what he had transformed his life into . And now , even in the morning light , it lay under the shadow of his failure , and he could not bear to look at it . It was his life , and he was no longer in it . Somebody else , some other thing that did not even know it , stood ready to take possession of it . He was ashamed in its presence . To look directly at it would be like looking Martha Elizabeth full in the eyes , which he could not do either . And his shame raged in him . <p> When she stopped in the lot in front of the barn and helped him down , he started unhitching the team . But she took hold of his arm and drew him away gently toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " You 've got to have you something to eat and some rest . " <p> But he jerked away from her . " Go see to your mammy ! " <p> " No , " she said . " Come on . " And she attempted again to move him toward the house . <p> He pushed her away , and she fell . He could have cut off his hand for so misusing her , and yet his rage at himself included her . He reached into the wagon box and took out a short hickory stock with a braid of rawhide knotted to it . He shook it at her . <p> " Get up , " he said . " Get yonder to that house ' fore I wear you out . " <p> He had never spoken to her in such a way , had never imagined himself doing so . He hated what he had done , and he could not undo it . <p> The heat of the day had established itself now . There was not a breeze anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valley and redoubled the light . Within that blinding glare he occupied a darkness that was loud with accusing cries . <p> Martha Elizabeth stood at the kitchen door a moment , looking back at him , and then she went inside . Thad turned back to the team then , unhitched them , did up the lines , and led the mules to their stalls in the barn He moved as if dreaming through these familiar motions that had now estranged themselves from him . The closer he had come to home , the more the force of his failure had gathered there to exclude him . <p> And it was Ben Feltner who had barred the door and left him without a friend . Ben Feltner , who owed nothing , had turned his back on his friend , who now owed everything . <p> He said aloud , " Yes , I 'll come back sober , God damn you to hell ! " <p> He lifted the jug out of the white mule 's manger , pulled the cob from its mouth , and drank . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lasted him three days , and now it was empty . He cocked his wrist and broke the jug against an upright . <p> " Well , that does for you , old holler-head . " <p> He stood , letting the whiskey seek its level in him , and felt himself slowly come into purpose ; for now he had his anger full and clear . Now he was summoned by an almost visible joy . <p> He went to the house , drank from the water bucket on the back porch , and stepped through the kitchen door . Rachel and Martha Elizabeth were standing together by the cookstove , facing him . <p> " Thad , honey , I done fixed dinner , " Rachel said . " Set down and eat . " <p> He opened the stairway door , stepped up and took down his pistol from the little shelf over the door frame . <p> " No , now , " Martha Elizabeth said . " Put that away . You ai n't got a use in this world for that . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't you say another damned word . " <p> He put the pistol in his hip pocket with the barrel sticking up and turned to the door . <p> " Wait , Thad , " Rachel said . " Eat a little before you go . " But she was already so far behind him that he hardly heard her . <p> He walked to the barn , steadying himself by every upright thing he came to , so that he proceeded by a series of handholds on doorjamb and porch post and gatepost and tree . He could no longer see the place , but walked in a shifting aisle of blinding light through a cloud of darkness . Behind him now was almost nothing . And ahead of him was the singular joy to which his heart now beat in answer . <p> He went into the white mule 's stall , unbuckled hamestrap and bellyband , and shoved the harness off her back , letting it fall . He unbuckled the collar and let it fall . Again his rage swelled within him until it seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body might fail to contain it , for he had never before in his life allowed a mule 's harness to touch the ground if he could help it . But he was not in his life now , and his rage pleased him . <p> He hooked his finger in the bit ring and led the mule to the drinking trough by the well in front of the barn . The trough was half an oak barrel , nearly full of water . The mule wanted to drink , but he jerked her head up and drew her forward until she stood beside the trough . The shorn stubble of her mane under his hand , he stepped up onto the rim . Springing , he cast himself across the mule 's back , straddled her , and sat upright as darkness swung around him . He jerked hard at the left rein . <p> " Get up , Beck , " he said . <p> The mule was as principled as a martyr . She would have died before she would have trotted a step , and yet he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hind feet of the mule lifted from their tracks , the thought of Martha Elizabeth formed itself within the world 's ruin . She seemed to rise up out of its shambles , like a ghost or an influence . She would follow him . He needed to hurry . <p> On the fringe of the Saturday bustle in front of the business houses , Ben met Early Rowanberry and his little boy , Arthur . Early was carrying a big sack , and Art a small one . They had started out not long after breakfast ; from the log house on the ridgetop where the Rowanberrys had settled before Kentucky was a state , they had gone down the hill , forded the creek known as Sand Ripple , and then walked up the Shade Branch hollow through the Feltner place and on to town . Early had done his buying and a little talking , had bought a penny 's worth of candy for Art , and now they were starting the long walk back . Ben knew that they had made the trip on foot to spare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their shoulders before they made it home . <p> " Well , Early , " Ben said , " you 've got a good hand with you today , I see . " <p> " He 's tol'ble good company , Ben , and he packs a little load , " Early said . <p> Ben liked all the Rowanberrys , who had been good neighbors to him all his life , and Early was a better-than-average Rowanberry  --  a quiet man with a steady gaze and a sort of local fame for his endurance at hard work . <p> Ben then offered his hand to Art , who shyly held out his own . But then Ben said , " My boy , are you going to grow up to be a wheelhorse like your pap ? " and Art answered without hesitation , " Yes , sir . " <p> " Ah , that 's right , " Ben said . And he placed his hand on the boy 's unladen shoulder . <p> The two Rowanberrys then resumed their homeward journey , and Ben walked on down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in no hurry . He had his mission in mind and was somewhat anxious about it , but he gave it its due place in the order of things . Thad 's difficulty was not simple ; whatever it was possible to do for him could not be done in a hurry . Ben passed slowly through the talk of the place and time , partaking of it . He liked the way the neighborhood gathered into itself on such days . Now and then , in the midst of the more casual conversation , a little trade talk would rouse up over a milk cow or a pocketknife or a saddle or a horse or mule . Or there would be a joke or a story or a bit of news , uprisings of the town 's interest in itself that would pass through it and die away like scurries of wind . It was close to noon . It was hot even in the shade now , and the smells of horse sweat and horse manure had grown strong . On the benches and kegs along the storefronts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear upon long scrolls of cedar or poplar curling backward over thumbs and wrists and piling over shoetops . <p> Somebody said , " Well , I can see the heat waves a-rising . " <p> Somebody else said , " Ai n't nobody but a lazy man can see them heat waves . " <p> And then Ben saw Thad 's cousin , Dave Coulter , and Dave 's son , Burley , coming out of one of the stores , Dave with a sack of flour on his shoulder and Burley with a sack of meal on his . Except for his boy 's face and grin , Burley was a grown man . He was seventeen , a square-handed , muscular fellow already known for the funny things he said , though his elders knew of them only by hearsay . He and his father turned down the street toward their wagon , and Ben followed them . <p> When they had hunched the sacks off their shoulders into the wagon , Ben said , " Dave ? " <p> Dave turned to him and stuck out his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " How are you , Dave ? " <p> " Bout all right , I reckon . " <p> " And how are you , Burley ? " <p> Dave turned to his boy to see that he would answer properly , and Burley , grinning , said , " Doing about all right , thank you , sir , " and Dave turned back to Ben . <p> " Had to lay in a little belly timber , " he said , " gains " we run plumb out . And the boy here , he wanted to come see the sights . " <p> " Well , my boy , " Ben said , " have you learned anything worthwhile ? " <p> Burley grinned again , gave a quick nod , and said , " Yessing " <p> " Oh , hit 's an educational place , " Dave said . " We hung into one of them educational conversations yonder in the store . That 's why we ai n't hardly going to make it back home by dinnertime . " <p> " Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . And he told Dave as much as he had understood of Thad 's trouble . They were leaning against the wagon box , facing away from the road . Burley , who had gone to untie the mules , was still standing at their heads . <p> " Well , " Dave said , " hit 's been norated around that Abner were n't doing just the way he ought to . Tell you the truth , I been juberous about that loan proposition ever since Thad put his name to it . Put his whole damned foothold in that damned boy 's pocket is what he done . And now you say it 's all gone up the spout . " <p> " He 's in a serious fix , no question about it . " <p> " Well , is there anything a feller can do for him ? " <p> " Well , there 's one thing for certain . He was drunk when he came to see me . He was cussing and raring . If you , or some of you , could get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see if we can help him out of his scrape . " <p> " Talking rough , was he ? " <p> " Rough enough . " <p> " I 'm sorry , Ben . Thad do n't often drink , but when he does he drinks like the Lord appointed him to get rid of all of it . " <p> Somebody said , " Look out ! " <p> They turned to see Thad and the white mule almost abreast of them . Thad was holding the pistol . <p> " They said he just looked awful , " my grandmother said . " He looked like death warmed over . " <p> Ben said , without raising his voice , in the same reasonable tone in which he had been speaking to Dave , " Hold on , Thad . " <p> And Thad fired . <p> Dave saw a small round red spot appear in the center of Ben 's forehead . A perplexed look came to his face , as if he had been intending to say something more and had forgotten what it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been , one hand on the rim of the wagon box . And then he fell . As he went down , his shoulder struck the hub of the wagon wheel so that he fell onto his side , his hat rolling underneath the wagon . <p> Thad put the pistol back into his hip pocket . The mule had stood as still after he had halted her as if she were not there at all , but at home under a tree in the pasture . When Thad kicked her , she went on again . <p> Ben Feltner never had believed in working on Sunday , and he did not believe in not working on workdays . Those two principles had shaped all his weeks . He liked to make his hay cuttings and begin other large , urgent jobs as early in the week as possible in order to have them finished before Sunday . On Saturdays , he and Mat and the hands worked in the crops if necessary ; otherwise , that day was given to the small jobs of maintenance that the farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would do nothing except milk and feed . When the work was caught up and the farm in order , Ben liked to have everybody quit early on Saturday afternoon . He liked the quiet that descended over the place then , with the day of rest ahead . <p> On that Saturday morning he had sent Old Smoke , Aunt Cass 's husband , and their son , Samp , and Samp 's boy , Joe , to mend a fence back on the river bluff . Mat he sent to the blacksmith shop to have the shoes reset on Governor , his buggy horse . They would not need Governor to go to church ; they walked to church . But when they had no company on Sunday afternoon , and the day was fair , Ben and Nancy liked to drive around the neighborhood , looking at the crops and stopping at various households to visit . They liked especially to visit Nancy 's brother , Jack Beechum , and his wife , Ruth , who lived on the Beechum home place , the place that Nancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And so Mat , that morning , after his chores were done , had slipped a halter on Governor and led him down through town to the blacksmith 's . He had to wait  --  there were several horses and mules already in line  --  and so he tied Governor to the hitch rail in front of the shop and went in among the others who were waiting and talking , figuring that he would be late for dinner . <p> It was a good place . The shop stood well back from the street , leaving in front of it a tree-shaded , cinder-covered yard , which made room for the hitch rail and for the wagons , sleds , and other implements waiting to be repaired . The shop itself was a single large , dirt-floored room , meticulously clean  --  very surface swept and every tool in place . Workbenches went around three walls . Near the large open doorway were the forge and anvil . <p> The blacksmith  --  a low , broad , grizzled man by the name of Elder Johnson  --  was the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which sometimes made him difficult . He also remembered precisely every horse or mule he had ever nailed a shoe on , and so he was one of the keepers of the town 's memory . <p> Elder was shoeing a colt that was nervous and was giving him trouble . He was working fast so as to cause the colt as little discomfort as he could . He picked up the left hind hoof , caught it between his aproned knees , and laid the shoe on it . The shoe was too wide at the heel , and he let the colt 's foot go back to the floor . A small sharp-faced man smoking a cob pipe was waiting , holding out a broken singletree for Elder 's inspection as he passed on his way back to the forge . <p> Elder looked as if the broken tree were not the sort of thing that could concern him . <p> " Could I get this done by this evening ? " the man asked . His name was Skeets Willard , and his work was always in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wheel , " he said , " till I get that fixed . " <p> Elder let fall the merest glance at the two pieces of the singletree , and then looked point-blank at the man himself as if surprised not only by his presence but by his existence . " What the hell do you think I am ? A hammer with a brain ? Do you see all them horses and mules tied up out there ? If you want that fixed , I 'll fix it when I can . If you do n't , take it home . " <p> Skeets Willard elected to lay the pieces down in a conspicuous place by the forge . And Elder , whose outburst had not interrupted the flow of talk among the bystanders , caught the shoe in his tongs and shoved it in among the coals of the forge . He cranked the bellows and made small white flames spike up out of the coals . As he turned the handle , he stared in a kind of trance at the light of the open doorway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face and his arms were shining with sweat . Presently he drew the shoe , glowing , out of the coals and , laying it on the horn of the anvil , narrowed the heel . He then plunged it into the slack tub from which it raised a brief shriek of steam . <p> Somebody turned out of the conversation and said , " Say , Elder , do you remember that little red mule come in here with a bunch of yearlings Marce Catlett bought up around Lexington ? Ned , I think they called him . " <p> " Newt , " Elder said in so even a voice that Skeets Willard might never have been there . " You bet I remember him . " <p> He took the cooled shoe from the slack tub and , picking up the colt 's foot and straddling it again , quickly nailed one nail in each side , raking the points over with the claws of his hammer . He let the colt stand on his foot again to see how the shoe set . " You bet I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could kick the lard out of a biscuit . " <p> And then they heard the single voice raised in warning out in the road , followed immediately by the shot and by a rising murmur of excited , indistinguishable voices as the whole Saturday crowd turned its attention to the one thing . <p> Mat hurried out with the others and saw the crowd wedged in between the storefronts and Dave Coulter 's wagon . He only began to realize that the occasion concerned him when the crowd began to make way for him as he approached . <p> " Let him through ! Let him through ! " the crowd said . <p> The crowd opened to let him through , turning its faces to him , falling silent as it saw who he was . And then he saw what was left of the man who had been his father lying against the wagon wheel . Those nearest him heard him say , " Oh ! " and it did not sound like him at all . He stepped forward and knelt and took his father 's wrist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not expect , having seen the wound and the fixed unsighted eyes . The crowd now was as quiet around him as the still treetops along the road . For what seemed a long time Mat knelt there with his father 's dead wrist in his hand , while his mind arrived and arrived and yet arrived at that place and time and that body lying still on the bloodied stones . When he looked up again he did not look like the man they had known at all . <p> " Who did this ? " he said . <p> And the crowd answered , " Thad Coulter , he done it . " <p> " Where 'd he go ? " <p> " He taken down the road yonder towards Hargrave . He was on that old white mule , old May . " <p> When Mat stood up again from his father 's side , he was a man new-created by rage . All that he had been and thought and done gave way to his one desire to kill the man who had killed his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elation of that one thought . He was not armed , but he never thought of that . He would go for the horse he had left tied at the blacksmith 's . He would ride Thad Coulter down . He would come up beside him and club him off the mule . He would beat him down out of the air . And in that thought which lived more in his right arm than in his head , both he and his enemy were as clear of history as if newborn . <p> By the time Mat was free of the crowd , he was running . <p> Jack Beechum had sold a team of mules the day before , and so he had a check to carry to the bank . He also had a list of things that Ruth wanted from town , and now that he had money ahead he wanted to settle his account at Chatham 's store . His plan was to do his errands in town and get back home by dinner ; that afternoon he wanted to mow a field of hay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town on a good black gelding called Socks for his four white pasterns . <p> He tied the horse some distance from the center of town in a place of better shade and fewer flies . He went to the bank first , and then went about gathering the things that Ruth needed , ending up at Chatham 's . He was sitting by Beater Chatham 's desk in the back , watching Beater total up his account , when they heard the shot out in the street . <p> " Sounds like they 're getting Saturday started out there , " Jack said . <p> " I reckon , " Beater said , checking his figures . <p> " They 're going to keep on until they shoot somebody who do n't deserve it . " <p> Beater looked at him then over the tops of his glasses . " Well , they 'll have to look around outside town to find somebody , wo n't they ? " He filled out a check for the amount of the bill and handed the check to Jack for him to sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the store stepped back in again and said , " Jack , you 'd better come . They 've shot Ben Feltner . " <p> Jack never signed the check that day or for several days . He ran to the door . When he was outside , he saw first the crowd and then Mat running toward him out of it . Without breaking his own stride , he caught Mat and held him . <p> They were both moving at some speed , and the crowd heard the shock of the impact as the two men came together . Jack could hardly have known what he was doing . He had no time to think . He may have been moved by an impulse simply to stop things until he could think . Or perhaps he knew by the look on Mat 's face that he had to be obstructed . At any rate , as soon as Jack had taken hold of Mat , he understood that he had to hold him . And he knew that he had never taken hold of any such thing before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clamped his arms to his sides . Jack 's sole task was to keep Mat from freeing his arms . But Mat was little more than half Jack 's age ; he was in the prime of his strength . And now he twisted and strained with the concentration of fury , uttering cries that could have been either grunts or sobs , forcing Jack both to hold him and to hold him up . They strove there a long time , heaving and staggering , hardly moving from the tracks they had stood in when they came together , and the dust rose up around them . Jack felt that his arms would pull apart at the joints . He ached afterwards . Something went out of him that day , and he was not the same again . <p> And what went out of Jack came into Mat . Or so it seemed , for in that desperate embrace he became a stronger man than he had been . A strength came into him that held his grief and his anger as Jack had held him . And Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it enabled Mat to break free but because it enabled Jack to turn him loose . Mat ceased to strive , and Jack let go his hold . He stepped away , allowing himself to be recognized , and Mat stood . To Jack , it was as though he had caught one man and let another go . <p> But he put his eye on Mat , not willing yet to trust him entirely to himself , and waited . <p> They both were winded , wet with sweat , and for a moment they only breathed , watched by the crowd , Jack watching Mat , Mat looking at nothing . <p> As they stood so , the girl , Martha Elizabeth , walked by in the road . She did not look at them or at the wagon or at the body crumpled on the ground . She walked past it all , looking ahead , as if she already saw what she was walking toward . <p> Coming aware that Jack was waiting on him , Mat looked up ; he met Jack 's gaze . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot him . " <p> They waited , looking at each other still , while the earth shook under them . <p> Mat said , " I 'll go tell Ma . You bring Pa , but give me a little time . " <p> Dinner was ready , and the men were late . <p> " It was n't usual for them to be late , " my grandmother said , " but we did n't think yet that anything was wrong . Your mother was just a little girl then , and she was telling us a story about a doll and a dog and a horse . " <p> Aunt Cass stood by the stove , keeping an eye on the griddle . Nancy was sweeping the floor under the firebox of the stove ; she was a woman who was always doing . Margaret , having set the table , had turned one of the chairs out into the floor and sat down . All three were listening to Bess , who presently stopped her story , rolled her eyes , and said , " I hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> They laughed . <p> " I ' spect so , I ' specs so , " Aunt Cass said . " Well , you 'll get something to eat ' fore long . " <p> When she heard Mat at the kitchen door , Aunt Cass said , " Miss Nancy , you want to take the hoecake up ? " And then seeing the change in Mat 's face , which was new to it but old to the world , she hushed and stood still . Nancy , seeing the expression on Cass 's face , turned to look at Mat . <p> Bess said , " Goody ! Now we can eat ! " <p> Mat looked at his mother , and then down at Bess and smiled . " You can eat directly , " he said . <p> And then he said , " Margaret , take Bess and go upstairs . I think she 's got a book up there she wants you to read to her . " <p> " I knew what it was then , " my grandmother said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me before I knew it in my mind . I just wanted to crawl away . But I had your mother to think about . You always have somebody to think about , and it 's a blessing . " <p> She said , " Come on , Bess , let 's go read a story . We 'll eat in a little bit . " <p> As soon as he heard their footsteps going up the stairs , Mat looked at his mother again . As the silence gathered against him , he said , " Ma , I 'm sorry , Pa 's dead . Thad Coulter has shot him . " <p> She was already wearing black . She had borne four children and raised one . Two of her children she had buried in the same week of a diphtheria epidemic , of which she had nearly died herself . After the third child had died , she never wore colors again . It was not that she chose to be ostentatiously bereaved . She could not have chosen to be ostentatious about anything . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native cheerfulness . And yet she had accepted a certain darkness that she had lived in too intimately to deny . <p> She stood , looking at Mat , while she steadied herself , and steadied the room around her , in the quiet that , having suddenly begun there , would not end for a long time . And then she said to Mat , " Sit down . " <p> She said , " Cass , sit down . " <p> They turned chairs away from the table and sat down , and then she did . <p> " Now , " she said , " I want to know what happened . " <p> In the quiet Mat told as much , as little , as he knew . <p> As if to exert herself against the silence that too quickly filled the room , Nancy stood again . She laid her hand on the shoulder of Mat 's wet shirt and patted it once . <p> " Cass , " she said , " we must n't cry , " though there were tears on her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " go get Smoke and Samp and Joe . Tell them , and tell them to come here . " <p> To Aunt Cass again , she said , " We must fix the bed . They 'll need a place to lay him . " <p> And then they heard the burdened footsteps at the door . <p> In his cresting anger in the minutes before he stopped the mule in the road in Port William and fired the one shot that he ever fired in anger in his life , Thad Coulter knew a fierce , fulfilling joy . He saw the shot home to the mark , saw Ben Feltner stand a moment and go down , and then he heeled the mule hard in the side and rode on . He went on because all behind him that he might once have turned back to was gone from his mind , and perhaps even in his joy he knew that from that time there was to be no going back . <p> Even before the town was out of sight behind him , his anger and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life 's blood were running out of him , and he tried to stanch the flow by muttering aloud the curses of his rage . But they had no force , and his depletion continued . <p> His first thought beyond his anger was of the mule . She was thirsty , he knew , and he had denied her a drink . <p> " When we get to the creek , " he said . <p> The mule followed the windings of the road down off the upland . Below the cleared ridges , they passed through woods . On the gentler open slopes below , they came into the blank sunlight again , and he could see the river winding between its wooded banks toward its meeting with the Ohio at Hargrave . <p> At the foot of the hill , the road dipped under trees again and forded a creek . Thad rode the mule into the pool above the ford , loosened the rein , and let her drink . It was a quiet , deeply shaded place , the water unrippled until the mule stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thad could hear the quiet , and a bottomless sorrow opened in him , causing him suddenly to clutch his belly and groan aloud . <p> When the mule had finished drinking , he rode her out of the pool , dismounted , and , unbuckling one end of the rein from the bit , led her into a clump of bushes and tall weeds and tied her there . For now the thought of pursuit had come to him , and he knew he would have to go the rest of the way on foot . The mule could not be hurried , and she would be difficult to hide . <p> He went back to the pool and knelt at the edge of it and drank , and then he washed his hands and in his cupped hands lifted the clear water time and again to his face . <p> Presently , he became still , listening . He could hear nothing but the cicadas in the surrounding trees . And then he heard , coming fast , the sound of loud talking and the rapid hooftread of horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several riders go by on the road . They were boys and young men from the town who , having waited through the aftermath of the shooting , had now been carried by their excitement into pursuit of him . Boys , he thought . He felt in no danger from them  --  he did not think of the pistol  --  and yet he feared them . He now imagined himself hurrying on foot along the road , while the young riders picked and pecked at him . <p> The quiet returned , and he could feel , as if in the hair roots and pores of his skin , that Martha Elizabeth was coming near . He went back to the road again . <p> The walking and the water drying on his face cleared his mind , and now he knew himself as he had been and as he was , and knew that he was changed beyond unchanging into something he did not love . Now that his anger had drained away , his body seemed to him not only to be a burden almost too heavy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . He walked with one hand pressed to his belly , where the collapse seemed already to have begun . <p> The best route between Port William and Hargrave was still the river . The road found its way as if by guess , bent this way and that by the whims of topography and the convenience of landowners . At intervals , it was interrupted by farm gates . <p> After a while , hearing several more horses coming behind him , he stepped out of the road and lay down in a small canebrake . When they had passed , he returned to the road and went on . Always he was watchful of the houses he passed , but he stayed in the road . If he was to protect the one choice of which he was still master , he had to hurry . <p> And now , as he had not been able to do when he left it , he could see his farm . It shone in his mind as if inwardly lighted in the darkness that now surrounded both him and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the woods and the sloping pastures , on the little croplands on the ridge and in the bottoms along the creek . He could see its cool shadows stretching out in the evening and the milk cows coming down the path to the barn . It was irrevocably behind him now , as if a great sword had fallen between him and it . <p> He was slow and small on the long road . The sun was slow overhead . The air was heavy and unmoving . He watched the steady stepping of his feet , the road going backward beneath them . He had to get out of the road only twice again : once for a family in a spring wagon coming up from Hargrave and once for another horse and rider coming down from Port William . Except for those , nothing moved in the still heat but himself . Except for the cicadas , the only sounds he heard were his own steady footfalls on the dry dust . <p> He seemed to see always not only the changing road beneath his feet but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighted in the dark behind him , and it came to him that on that day two lives had ended for a possibility that never had existed : for Abner Coulter 's mounting up to a better place . And he felt the emptiness open wider in him and again heard himself groan . He wondered , so great was the pain of that emptiness , that he did not weep , but it exceeded weeping as it exceeded words . Beyond the scope of one man 's grief , it cried out in the air around him , as if in that day 's hot light , the trees and the fields and the dust of the road all grieved . An inward pressure that had given his body its shape seemed to have been withdrawn , and he walked , holding himself , resisting step by step the urge to bend around the emptiness opening in his middle and let himself fall . <p> Where the valley began to widen toward the river 's mouth , the road passed a large bottom planted in corn . Thad looked back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did see her . She was maybe three-quarters of a mile behind him , small in the distance , and the heat rising off the field shimmered and shook between them , but he knew her . He walked faster , and he did not look back again . It seemed to him that she knew everything he knew , and loved him anyhow . She loved him , minute by minute , not only as he had been , but as he had become . It was a wonderful and a fearful thing to him that he had caused such a love for himself to come into the world , and then had failed it . He could not have bowed low enough before it and remained above ground . He could not bear to think of it . But he knew that she walked behind him  --  balanced across the distance , in the same hot light , the same darkness , cluster of houses at Ellville , at the end of the bridge , and went across into Hargrave . From the bridge to the courthouse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not alter his gait or look at anybody . If anybody looked at him , he did not know it . At the cross streets , he could see on the river a towboat pushing a line of barges slowly upstream , black smoke gushing from its stacks . The walks were full of people , and the streets were full of buggies and wagons . He crossed the courthouse yard where people sat on benches or stood talking in little groups under the shade trees . It seemed to him that he walked in a world from which he had departed . <p> When he went through the front door of the courthouse into the sudden cool darkness of the hallway , he could not see . Lights swam in his eyes in the dark , and he had to prop himself against the wall . The place smelled of old paper and tobacco and of human beings , washed and unwashed . When he could see again , he walked to a door under a sign that said " Sheriff " broad-brimmed and went in . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a row of chairs for people to wait in , and several spittoons , placed for the presumed convenience of spitters , had been as much missed as hit . No one was there but a large man in a broad-brimmed straw hat and a suit somewhat too small , who was standing behind a high desk , writing something . At first he did not look up . When he finally did look up , he stared at Thad for some time as if not sufficiently convinced of what he saw . <p> " In a minute , " he said , and looked down again and finished what he was writing . There was a badge pinned lopsidedly to the pocket of his shirt , and he held an unlit cigar like another pen in his left hand . He said as he wrote , " You been drove hard and put up wet , I reckon . " <p> " Yes , " Thad said . " I have killed a man . " <p> The sheriff laid the pen on the blotter and looked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ben Feltner , the best friend ever I had . " His eyes suddenly brimmed with tears , but they did not fall . He made no sound and he did not move . <p> " You 're a Coulter , ai n't you ? From up about Port William ? " <p> " Thad , " Thad said . <p> The sheriff would have preferred that Thad had remained a fugitive . He did not want a self-confessed murderer on his hands  --  especially not one fresh from a Saturday killing in Port William . He knew Ben Feltner , knew he was liked , and feared there would be a commotion . Port William , as far as he was concerned , was nothing but trouble , almost beyond the law 's reach and certainly beyond its convenience  --  a source , as far as he was concerned , of never-foreseeable bad news . He did not know what would come next , but he thought that something would , and he did not approve of it . <p> " I wish to hell , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other would just , by God , go ahead and do it . " He looked at Thad for some time in silence , as if giving him an opportunity to disappear . <p> " Well , " he said , finally , " I reckon you just as well give me the pistol . " <p> He gestured toward Thad 's sagging hip pocket , and Thad took out the pistol and gave it to him . <p> " Come on , " the sheriff said . <p> Thad followed him out a rear door into the small paved yard of the jail , where the sheriff rang for the jailer . <p> The sheriff had hardly got back into the office and taken up his work again when a motion in the doorway alerted him . He looked and saw a big red-faced girl standing just outside the door as if uncertain whether or not it was lawful to enter . She wore a sunbonnet , a faded blue dress that reached to her ankles , and an apron . Though she was obviously timid and unused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Come in , " he said . <p> She crossed the threshold and again stopped . <p> " What can I do for you , miss ? " <p> " I 'm a-looking for Mr. Thad Coulter from up to Port William , please , sir . " <p> " You his daughter ? " <p> " Yes , sir . " <p> " Well , he 's here . I got him locked up . He claims he killed a fellow . " <p> " He did , " the girl said . " Is it allowed to see him ? " <p> " Not now , " the sheriff said . " You come back in the morning , miss . You can see him then . " <p> She stood looking at him another moment , as if to make sure that he had said what he meant , and then she said , " Well , I thank you , " and went out . <p> An hour or so later , when he shut the office and started home to supper , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the shade trees , looking down at her hands in her lap . <p> " You see , " my grandmother said , " there are two deaths in this  --  Mr. Feltner 's and Thad Coulter 's . We know Mr. Feltner 's because we had to know it . It was ours . That we know Thad 's is because of Martha Elizabeth . The Martha Elizabeth you know . " <p> I knew her , but it came strange to me now to think of her  --  to be asked to see her  --  as a girl . She was what I considered an old woman when I first remember her ; she was perhaps eight or ten years younger than my grandmother , the fire-red long gone from her hair . She was a woman always near to smiling , sometimes to laughter . Her face , it seemed , had been made to smile . It was a face that assented wholly to the being of whatever and whomever she looked at . She had gone with her father to the world 's edge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Martha Elizabeth , we younger ones called her . Everybody loved her . <p> When the sheriff came back from supper , she was still there on the bench , the Saturday night shoppers and talkers , standers and passers leaving a kind of island around her , as if unwilling to acknowledge the absolute submission they sensed in her . The sheriff knew as soon as he laid eyes on her this time that she was not going to go away . Perhaps he understood that she had no place to go that she could get to before it would be time to come back . <p> " Come on with me , " he said , and he did not sound like a sheriff now but only a man . <p> She got up and followed him through the hallway of the courthouse , past the locked doors of the offices , out again , and across the little iron-fenced courtyard in front of the jail . The sheriff unlocked a heavy sheet-iron door , opened it , and closed it behind them , and they were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , containing several cages , barred from floor to ceiling , the whole interior lighted by one kerosene lamp hanging in the corridor . <p> Among the bars gleaming dimly and the shadows of bars thrown back against concrete and stone , she saw her father sitting on the edge of a bunk that was only an iron shelf let down on chains from the wall , with a thin mattress laid on it . He had paid no attention when they entered . He sat still , staring at the wall , one hand pressed against his belly , the other holding to one of the chains that supported the bunk . <p> The sheriff opened the cell door and stood aside to let her in . " I 'll come back after while , " he said . <p> The door closed and was locked behind her , and she stood still until Thad felt her presence and looked up . When he recognized her , he covered his face with both hands . <p> " He put his hands over his face like a man ashamed , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , too , who had seen what he could n't bear . " She sat without speaking a moment , looking at me , for she had much to ask of me . " Maybe Thad saw his guilt full and clear then . But what he saw that he could n't bear was something else . " <p> And again she paused , looking at me . We sat facing each other on either side of the window ; my grandfather lay in one of his lengthening sleeps nearby . The old house in that moment seemed filled with a quiet that extended not only out into the whole broad morning but endlessly both ways in time . <p> " People sometimes talk of God 's love as if it 's a pleasant thing . But it is terrible , in a way . Think of all it includes . It included Thad Coulter , drunk and mean and foolish , before he killed Mr. Feltner , and it included him afterwards . " <p> She reached out then and touched the back of my right hand with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yet indelible as a tattoo . <p> " That 's what Thad saw . He saw his guilt . He had killed his friend . He had done what he could n't undo ; he had destroyed what he could n't make . But in the same moment he saw his guilt included in love that stood as near him as Martha Elizabeth and at that moment wore her flesh . It was surely weak and wrong of him to kill himself  --  to sit in judgment that way over himself . But surely God 's love includes people who ca n't bear it . " <p> The sheriff took Martha Elizabeth home with him that night ; his wife fed her and turned back the bed for her in the spare room . The next day she sat with her father in his cell . <p> " All that day , " my grandmother said , " he would hardly take his hands from his face . Martha Elizabeth fed him what little he would eat and raised the cup to his lips for what little he would drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to , almost not at all . I do n't know what they said . Maybe nothing . " <p> At bedtime again that night Martha Elizabeth went home with the sheriff . When they returned to the courthouse on Monday morning , Thad Coulter was dead by his own hand . <p> " It 's a hard story to have to know , " my grandmother said . " The mercy of it was Martha Elizabeth . " <p> She still had more to tell , but she paused again , and again she looked at me and touched my hand . <p> " If God loves the ones we ca n't , " she said , " then finally maybe we can . All these years I 've thought of him sitting in those shadows , with Martha Elizabeth standing there , and his work-sore old hands over his face . " <p> Once the body of Ben Feltner was laid on his bed , the men who had helped Jack to carry him home went quietly out through the kitchen and the back door , as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response to Nancy 's " Thank you . " And Jack stayed . He stayed to be within sight or call of his sister when she needed him , and he stayed to keep his eye on Mat . Their striving with each other in front of Chatham 's store , Jack knew , had changed them both . Because he did not yet know how or how much or if it was complete , it was not yet a change that he was willing , or that he dared , to turn his back on . <p> Someone was sent to take the word to Rebecca Finley , Margaret 's mother , and to ask her to come for Bess . <p> When Rebecca came , Margaret brought Bess down the stairs into the quiet that the women now did their best to disguise . But Bess , who did not know what was wrong and who tactfully allowed the pretense that nothing was , knew nevertheless that the habits of the house were now broken , and she had heard that quiet that she would never forget . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , " Margaret said , giving her voice the lilt of cheerfulness . " You 've been talking about going to stay with her , have n't you ? " <p> And Bess said , dutifully supplying the smile she felt her mother wanted , " Yes . " <p> " We 're going to bake some cookies just as soon as we get home , " Rebecca said . " Do you want to bake a gingerbread boy ? " <p> " Yes , " Bess said . <p> She removed her hand from her mother 's hand and placed it in her grandmother 's . They went out the door . <p> The quiet returned . From then on , though there was much that had to be done and the house stayed full of kin and neighbors coming and going or staying to help , and though by midafternoon women were already bringing food , the house preserved a quiet against all sound . No voice was raised . No door was slammed . Everybody moved as if in consideration not of each other , but of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragile peacefulness in Ben 's new sleep that should not be intruded upon . <p> Jack Beechum was party to that quiet . He made no sound . He said nothing , for his own silence had become wonderful to him and he could not bear to break it . Though Nancy , after the death of their mother , had given Jack much of his upbringing and had been perhaps more his mother than his sister , Ben had never presumed to be a father to him . From the time Jack was eight years old , Ben had been simply his friend  --  had encouraged , instructed , corrected , helped , and stood by him ; had placed a kindly , humorous , forbearing expectation upon him that he could not shed or shirk and had at last lived up to . They had been companions . And yet , through the rest of that day , Jack had his mind more on Mat than on Ben . <p> Jack watched Mat as he would have watched a newborn colt weak on its legs that he had helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . All afternoon Jack did not sit down because Mat did not . Sometimes there were things to do , and they were busy . Space for the coffin had to be made in the living room . Furniture had to be moved . When the time came , the laden coffin had to be moved into place . But , busy or not , Mat was almost constantly moving , as if seeking his place in a world newly made that day , a world still shaking and doubtful underfoot . And Jack both moved with him and stayed apart from him , watching . When they spoke again , they would speak on different terms . <p> There was a newness in the house , a solemnity , a sort of wariness , a restlessness as of a dog uneasy on the scent of some creature undeniably present but unknown . In its quiet , the house seemed to be straining to accommodate Ben 's absence , made undeniable and insistent by the presence of his body lying still under his folded hands . <p> Jack would come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horror and the pity of it , and the grief , the awe and gratitude and love and sorrow and regret , when Ben , newly dead and renewing sorrow for others dead before , would wholly occupy his mind in the night , and could give no comfort , and would not leave . But now Jack stayed by Mat and helped as he could . <p> In the latter part of the afternoon came Della Budge , Miss Della , bearing an iced cake on a stand like a lighted lamp . As she left the kitchen and started for the front door , she laid her eyes on Jack , who was standing in the door between the living room and the hall . She was a large woman , far gone in years . It was a labor for her to walk . She advanced each foot ahead of the other with care , panting , her hand on her hip , rocking from side to side . She wore many clothes , for her blood was thin and she was easily chilled , and she carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her little dustcap struggled to stay on top of her head . A tiny pair of spectacles perched awry on her nose . She had a face like a shriveled apple , and the creases at the corners of her mouth were stained with snuff . Once she had been Jack 's teacher . For years they had waged a contest in which she had endeavored to teach him the begets from Abraham to Jesus and he had refused to learn them . He was one of her failures , but she maintained a proprietary interest in him nonetheless . She was the only one left alive who called him " Jackie . " <p> As she came up to him he said , " Hello , Miss Della . " <p> " Well , Jackie , " she said , lifting and canting her nose to bring her spectacles to bear upon him , " poor Ben has met his time . " <p> " Yes , ma'am , " Jack said . " One of them things . " <p> " When your time comes you must go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Yes , ma'am , " Jack said . He was standing with his hands behind him , leaning back against the doorjamb . <p> " It 'll come by surprise , " she said . " It 's a time appointed , but we 'll not be notified . " <p> Jack said he knew it . He did know it . <p> " So we must always be ready , " she said . " Pray without ceasing . " <p> " Yes , ma'am . " <p> " Well , God bless Ben Feltner . He was a good man . God rest his soul . " <p> Jack stepped ahead of her to help her out the door and down the porch steps . <p> " Why , thank you , Jackie , " she said as she set foot at last on the walk . <p> He stood and watched her going away , walking , it seemed to him , a tottering edge between eternity and time . <p> Toward evening Margaret laid the table , and the family and several of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three men had come , and they were sitting in the living room by the coffin . The table was spread with the abundance of food that had been brought in . They were just preparing to sit down when the murmur of voices they had been hearing from the road down in front of the stores seemed to converge and to move in their direction . Those in the kitchen stood and listened a moment , and then Mat started for the front of the house . The others followed him through the hall and out onto the porch . <p> The sun was down , the light cool and directionless , so that the colors of the foliage and of the houses and storefronts of the town seemed to glow . Chattering swifts circled and swerved above the chimneys . Nothing else moved except the crowd that made its way at an almost formal pace into the yard . The people standing on the porch were as still as everything else , except for Jack Beechum , who quietly made his way forward until he stood behind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing at the top of the steps . <p> The crowd moved up near the porch and stopped . There was a moment of hesitation while it murmured and jostled inside itself . <p> " Be quiet , boys , " somebody said . " Let Doc do the talking . " <p> They became still , and then Doctor Starns , who stood in the front rank , took a step forward . <p> " Mat , " he said , " we 're here as your daddy 's friends . We 've got word that Thad Coulter 's locked up in the jail at Hargrave . We want you to know that we do n't like what he did . " <p> Several voices said , " No ! " and " Nosir ! " <p> " We know it was a thing done out of meanness . We do n't think we can stand for it , or that we ought to , or that we ought to wait on somebody else 's opinion about it . He was seen by a large number of witnesses to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's right ! " <p> " We think it 's our business , and we propose to make it our business . " <p> " That 's right ! " said several voices . <p> " It 's only up to you to say the word , and we 'll ride down there tonight and put justice beyond question . We have a rope . " <p> And in the now silent crowd someone held up a coil of rope , a noose already tied . <p> The doctor gave a slight bow of his head to Mat and then tipped his hat to Nancy who now stood behind Mat and to his right . And again the crowd murmured and slightly stirred within itself . <p> For what seemed to Jack a long time , Mat did not speak or move . The crowd grew quiet again , and again they could hear the swifts chittering in the air . Jack 's right hand ached to reach out to Mat . It seemed to him again that he felt the earth shaking under his feet , as Mat felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , Mat now stood resolved and calm upon it . Looking at the back of his head , Jack could still see the boy in him , but the head was up . The voice , when it came , was steady : <p> " No , gentlemen . I appreciate it . We all do . But I ask you not to do it . " <p> And Jack , who had not sat down since morning , stepped back and sat down . <p> Nancy , under whose feet the earth was not shaking , if it ever had , stepped up beside her son and took his arm . <p> She said to the crowd , " I know you are my husband 's friends . I thank you . I , too , must ask you not to do as you propose . Mat has asked you ; I have asked you ; if Ben could , he would ask you . Let us make what peace is left for us to make . " <p> " If you want to , " Mat said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you all are welcome . " <p> He had said , in all , six brief sentences . He was not a forward man . This , I think , was the only public speech of his life . <p> " I can see him yet , " my grandmother said , her eyes , full of sudden moisture , again turned to the window . " I wish you could have seen him . " <p> And now , after so many years , perhaps I have . I have sought that moment out , or it has sought me , and I see him standing without prop in the deepening twilight , asking his father 's friends to renounce the vengeance that a few hours before he himself had been furious to exact . <p> This is the man who will be my grandfather  --  the man who will be the man who was my grandfather . The tenses slur and slide under pressure of collapsed time . For that moment on the porch is not a now that was , but a now that is and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that followed and will follow . I know that in the days after his father 's death  --  and after Thad Coulter , concurring in the verdict of his would-be jury in Port William , hung himself in the Hargrave jail and so released Martha Elizabeth from her watch  --  my grandfather renewed and carried on his friendship with the Coulters : with Thad 's widow and daughters , with Dave Coulter and his family , and with another first cousin of Thad 's , Marce Catlett , my grandfather on my father 's side . And when my father asked leave of the Feltners to marry their daughter Bess , my mother , he was made welcome . <p> Mat Feltner dealt with Ben 's murder by not talking about it , and thus keeping it in the past . In his last years , I liked to get him to tell me about the violent old times of the town , the hard drinking and the fighting . And he would oblige me up to a point , enjoying the outrageous old stories himself , I think . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the telling when he would become silent , shake his head , lift one hand and let it fall ; and I would know  --  I know better now than I did then  --  that he had remembered his father 's death . <p> Though Coulters still abound in Port William , no Feltner of the name is left . But the Feltner line continues , joined to the Coulter line , in me , and I am here . I am blood kin to both sides of that moment when Ben Feltner turned to face Thad Coulter in the road and Thad pulled the trigger . The two families , sundered in the ruin of a friendship , were united again first in new friendship and then in marriage . My grandfather made a peace here that has joined many who would otherwise have been divided . I am the child of his forgiveness . <p> After Mat spoke the second time , inviting them in , the crowd loosened and came apart . Some straggled back down into the town ; others , as Mat had asked , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But Jack did not stay with them . As soon as he knew he was free , his thoughts went to other things . His horse had stood a long time , saddled , without water or feed . The evening chores were not yet done . Ruth would be wondering what had happened . In the morning they would come back together , to be of use if they could . And there would be , for Jack as for the others , the long wearing out of grief . But now he could stay no longer . <p> As soon as the porch was cleared , he retrieved his hat from the hall tree and walked quietly out across the yard under the maples and the descending night . So as not to be waylaid by talk , he walked rapidly down the middle of the road to where he had tied his horse . Lamps had now been lighted in the stores and the houses . <p> As he approached , his horse nickered to him . <p> " I know it , " Jack said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight on the stirrup , he started . Soon the lights and noises of the town were behind them , and there were only a few stars , a low red streak in the west , and the horse 's eager footfalls on the road . <p> <p> By WENDELL BERRY <p>
