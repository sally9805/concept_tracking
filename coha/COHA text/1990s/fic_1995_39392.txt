1 . The Ice Floe Bar and Grill <p> " I 'm a high-rolling entrepreneur on the free-market of love , " Whistling Pete told his closest friend , Buster Davenport , one sunny afternoon at the Ice Floe Bar and Grill . " You do n't blame Mercedes for selling cars , do you ? You do n't blame McDonald 's for frying burgers , or the Japs for peddling cheap , cars . Well , what I 've got just happens to be what the little girlies want . And when the little girlies want it , well . I do n't mean to sound rude , Buster  --  but I happen to be just the guy that 's gon na give it to them . " <p> The Ice Floe Bar and Grill was one of a series of new up-market franchise restaurants that had recently opened all across the tundra . As part of their inaugural promotion campaign , the Ice Floe was offering dollar Margaritas during Happy Hour , along with all the free mackerel you could lay your flippers on . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighed . He patted his firm white belly , as if testing for tone . <p> " This is the life , Buster , " he said philosophically , leaning back in his green vinyl lawn chair and folding his sleek muscular flippers behind his head . He and Buster were sitting on a veranda overlooking the outdoor pool . " Sunny days , starry nights , envelopes of rich fatty tissue to keep our butts warm , and loving spouses to go home to . What more could we ask ? What more , that is , than maybe a hasty little frolic in the frost with one of yonder ice-maidens ? " <p> Nodding towards the various lithe Penguinettes sporting themselves seductively around the pool , Whistling Pete clock-clocked his black tongue . His entire body shivered with a slow delicious enthusiasm for itself . <p> " Yeah , well , I just hope you know what you 're doing , " Buster said . Buster 's gaze was roving back and forth across the restaurant and patio . He kept glancing sheepishly over his shoulders , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brandishing blunt objects . <p> When the waitress came up behind him and said , " How you boys doing ? " Buster nearly jumped out of his socks . <p> " Whoa , there , Buster  --  relax , old buddy . It 's not the gendarmes , you know . " Whistling Pete cautioned his friend with an upraised flipper and presented the waitress his best award-winning smile . " And how are you doing this afternoon , sweetie ? " <p> " If you boys do n't need anything , " she said , " I 'll go check on my other tables . " <p> Buster , slightly out of breath , was still smoothing his ruffled tail feathers . " I guess I 'll have another Margarita , " he said , looking forlornly at his empty white side dish . " And if Happy Hour 's still on , could you maybe find us a little more mackerel ? " <p> Whistling Pete unashamedly examined the waitress 's fatty deposits . <p> " Me , " Whistling Pete said , " I 'll have what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicated the large commercial advertisement posted behind the bar . The ad featured a lithe , lovely Penguinette scantily clad in a white silk top hat and baggy white fishnet stockings . She was leaning against a sporty red snowmobile and stroking a large icy bottle of Smirnoff 's . <p> The bold black caption exclaimed : IT 'S PENGUINIFIC <p> While Buster resumed his edgy lookout for wives , Whistling Pete appreciatively watched their waitress waddle back to the bar with their order . <p> " Vah-vah-vah-voom " he said , and saluted her departing buttocks with the dissolving ice in his glass . Then he tossed down the slush with the last of his oyster sliders . His toes evinced a self-satisfied little wriggle . <p> " Life 's definitely the coolest , " Whistling Pete pronounced . " The sun rises , the sun sets . And so do I , Buster , old pal . So do I. " <p> Whistling Pete slammed his glass down on the table with a familiar emphasis . <p> " Yeah , well . " Buster 's eyes flicked from Entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He picked up the extinguished mackerel plate and sadly licked it . <p> " I just hope you know what you 're doing , " he said . <p> Whistling Pete arranged for a clandestine rendezvous with one of his ladies nearly every day at noon , just when the twilight sky was beginning to generate something like phosphorescence . They met unashamedly at the Ice Floe for drinks and quick , light lunches while Pete proffered flowers , compliments , stockings and chocolates . Then , as fast as their little legs could carry them , they dashed next door to the Crystal Palace Motel where Whistling Pete kept an open account . They ordered caviar and champagne through room service , sported themselves silly across the taut-fitted coverlets , and made the most they could of an hour  --  sometimes an hour and a half . <p> " This is the life , " Whistling Pete muttered every so often . " This is what the All-Mighty Penguin had in mind when he designed such cute little Penguinettes . " <p> Infidelity took all the knots out of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frantic rush of late orders at the warehouse where Pete worked , and the sense of blue dissolute formlessness Pete experienced whenever he gazed out his office window at the utterly black sky littered with cold white stars . <p> " It 's the worst weather in the entire universe , " Pete regularly complained to his early morning mug of Earl Grey . " Icicles , icebergs , ice-mountains and ice-rocks . I 'm not ashamed to say it . Antarctica really sucks , even for penguins . " <p> Then , looking up , he found himself exchanging a quick , illicit glance with Berenice , an Accounts secretary across the hall . A warm amorous pulse filled Whistling Pete 's sinuses and face . <p> After a moment , Berenice smiled and waved . Then , after another moment , Whistling Pete smiled and waved back . <p> One of these days , Pete reminded himself , I really must go over there and chat up our little Berenice . <p> The Penguinettes he did chat up were invariably young , impressionable , intelligent and very quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's office at Consolidated Fish , but mostly he met them during Happy Hour at the Ice Floe , or while swimming in the local ponds . They were office girls in a hurry to be young and did n't bother themselves too much about moral imperatives or social graces . <p> " I just figure we have nice times together , " Whistling Pete 's favorite girlfriend , Melody Long , frequently explained , usually after her second gin-and-tonic and a quick steamy romp in the Motel Sauna . " So maybe you 're married and have a baby  --  that 's cool . I 'm not a material girl . I do n't need , like , to own a boy just because I like him . " <p> Then , with a bubbly flirt and a giggle , she pinched Pete 's belly with one hand , and soothed his inflated pride with the other . <p> " Not that we can call our little whistler a boy exactly , " she reminded him , and began nibbling playfully at a stray chest-feather . " Mr. Pete is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . Is n't that right , cutey Is n't that right , you big bad boy , you ? " <p> Lunchtime was what Whistling Pete lived for  --  brightness , intoxication , energy and truth . Lunchtime was the passion and the glory . Lunchtime was life . <p> By the time Pete returned to his office he was already subsiding into a post-coital melancholy which was n't altogether unpleasant . He felt his mind descend into the sluggish depths of his own body , drifting through continents of ice , landmass , gravity and weight like a sort of bathysphere . Down here the green , gnarly water was populated by pulsing black shellfish , gigantic cyclopean squid , translucent spiny seaweeds , and dark brooding prehistoric entities squeezed into barnacled caverns and shipwrecked galleons . <p> " Hey there , bro , " Buster said , leaning into the office around four P.M. The day 's tentative flare of sunlight was already extinguishing . Weird bright glows and refractions cast themselves across the planes of dazzling white ice like spinning crystal discs . " We hitting Happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glancing anxiously over both his shoulders . He was not the sort of penguin who rushed headlong into life 's vast hiss and adventure . Instead , he anxiously avoided every bit of life that came rushing after him . <p> Whistling Pete took his feet off the desk and sat up abruptly in his spring-cocked office chair . He saw the binders and ledgers , the interoffice memos and gray , slimy faxes . This desk , this office . These hours measured by dollars , these dimensions demarcated by ice . <p> ( And somewhere else entirely : Melody , Martha , Trudy , Dallas , Pippa , Dolores and Joyce . ) <p> Or perhaps , Pete realized , Buster simply pretended not to know . <p> " Buster , old pal , " Pete said finally , and clapped his flippers together with brisk authority , " has the sun stopped shining or the earth ceased to spin ? Of course we 're hitting Happy Hour . And if I recall correctly , I believe it 's your turn to pick up the tab . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a phase Pete 's going through , " Estelle said , and succinctly regurgitated chunky blue broth into a white ceramic bowl . " Ever since he turned forty , he ca n't seem to sit still anymore . He stares at himself in the bathroom mirror all morning , combing his feathers and picking his teeth . Every day on his way home from work he forgets to pick things up at the store  --  milk , bread , mineral water , you name it . He 's wandering around in a dream world , Sandy , I swear . I know I should probably be hurt or angry , but I ca n't help feeling sorry for him . I think he 's going through some pretty heavy emotional changes right now . " <p> Estelle dabbed her beak with a pastel cloth napkin . Then she passed the bowl of broth to their six-month old fledgling , who was presently conducting a happy inner symphony with an upraised wooden ladle . <p> " Fish , " Junior exclaimed . " Fish-fishy-fish . " Estelle sighed . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Estelle said . <p> Buster 's wife , Sandy , lit another menthol cigarette and shook out her paper match with bristly impatience . <p> " For chrissakes , Estelle . Read the writing on the wall , will you ? Your lousy husband 's out fertilizing every yolk in town . What are you  --  blind or something ? " <p> Estelle gazed out the sparkling window and sighed , leaning her beak on one cocked flipper . Sometimes she just wanted to sit in her clean kitchen , watch the thin sunlight and feel the deep , immanent warmth of her own body . She was so bulked-up with raw meat after months of gravid-gorging that she could hardly waddle to the sink and back without falling out of breath . And now Sandy , lean and mean , telling her what to do with her life , as if she were some sort of expert . <p> " You do n't understand , Sandy , " Estelle said . " If you want to make a marriage work , then some things just are n't that simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and let me tell you how simple they are . Pete 's screwing every cow on the island . He 's dipping his wick in every candle on the beach . You can either tell him to shape up or move out . Or you can hack him to death with the stainless steel . I 'll tell you one thing , " Sandy said , punctuating her resolve by flicking a long , intact gray ash onto the checkered tablecloth , " if Buster ever pulled a fast one on me , boy , I 'd bite out a long message in his fat butt , that 's what I 'd do . " <p> Estelle wanted to explain , but she could n't seem to work up any words from the mulchy depths of her overloaded body . It was strange how flesh could reshape itself around you , as if it possessed mind and intention all its own . Estelle looked at the flaring brightness outside . Then she looked at her six-month-old fledgling , Pete Junior . <p> Without a second thought , Estelle thumped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't play with your food , Mister , " she said . <p> Caught in mid-gargle with a bolus of macerated mussel , Junior swallowed abruptly . He looked at his Mum with wide eyes and slowly put down his wooden ladle . <p> " Fish , " he said evenly , indicating his chunky broth . " Mum 's fish . " <p> Estelle felt the sadness in her body start to rotate . <p> " Yes , baby , " Estelle said . " Mum 's fish . " <p> Then , lowering her head to her folded and glistening black flippers , Estelle began to cry . Softly at first , but with a slowly rising intensity , like the sound of distant winter thunderclaps . <p> Sandy bit off another tiny puff from her menthol cigarette . She looked at Junior and Junior looked at her . <p> " There there , honey , " Sandy said softly . " It 'll be all right , honey . There there , there there . " <p> Then , extinguishing her cigarette in the glass ashtray , Sandy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Some days Whistling Pete did n't have any patience for family life . Grocery bills , diaper services , overpriced podiatrists , peeling linoleum and faulty pipes . " Domesticity is for the birds , " Pete pronounced solidly , walking home with Buster through the starry night . Atmospheric strobes and opacities wheeled across the high black sky like chapters out of Revelation . " I 'm talking the feathery , flighty kind of birds , you know ? The ones with their heads in the clouds ? Sure , it sounds nice and all  --  big tract houses , gas central heating , indoor plumbing and all that . Trade , commerce , low-tech industry , certified schools for the kids , community rep , all the bread in one basket , that sort of domesticity , you know . But basically , man , it 's an idea cooked up by the little girlies . Wives , man ; females seeking security for their babes . Girlies are home-builders , but us guys , we 're like homebreakers . It 's not our fault , Buster , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearth , three square meals , new wallpaper for the nursery , church weddings and matching cutlery . Us guys , however , we 're hunters and gatherers . We do n't want cornflakes for breakfast  --  we want the hot blood of the kill in our mouths . We want to venture beyond what we already know , and stop remembering the boring old places we 've already been . Nature 's cruel , Buster , just like us . Nature 's cruel , and so are us guys . " <p> The long white road descended into the village , leading Pete towards the smell of yeasty bread baking . He saw yellow light glowing in the windowpanes of his house , and the idea that he was anticipated made him edgy and ungallant . Two strange minds waiting in a house where he did n't belong . They knew he was coming . They knew he was already late . <p> He put his arm around Buster with a comradely squeeze and gestured downhill . " There it is , buddy . Our little village in the snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wilderness . Back in the old days our ancestors waddled around on rocks , man . They starved , hunted , mated and died without proper funerals or mortgage insurance . The only education they got came from the School of Hard Knocks . And who do you think first initiated the idea of houses , man ? Why , the ladies , of course . ' Let 's stack a few ice blocks over there as a sort of lean-to , ' they told their weary , flatulent old husbands . ' How about four walls , honey ? A roof and a floor ? ' Us guys would have lain out there scratching our lice on that stupid rock forever if we 'd had the choice , but the choice was n't ours , no way . " <p> Buster , well-oiled with budget tequila , was waddling along beside Pete with uncustomary resolution . Instead of glancing over his twitchy shoulders he gazed dreamily into the endlessly illuminated sky . Showers of meteors , swirls of galaxies , planets entrained by moons and whorling dust . Buster loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unencompassable and rinsed with sensation . It was a time when everything , even the universe , seemed at once awesomely complicated and weirdly specific . <p> " Actually , " Buster muttered out loud , " I always kind of dug domesticity . Beds with sheets , down comforters , canned lager and imported salsa . I like knowing I 'll get paid every Friday , week after week , as regular as clockwork . Some days , Sundays especially , I lie in my warm bed and let my mind wander . I do n't go anywhere . I just let my imagination loose and I wander . " <p> Pete whistled softly to himself . He was n't listening to a word Buster said , but then he had n't been listening to anybody for months now . He was thinking : Melody , Marianne , Gwendolyn and Jane . Tomorrow at noon and next Wednesday at twelve forty-five . While Pete 's body waddled down the steep slope towards the hard , unendurable village , his mind journeyed into different realms altogether . Places with thrill and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this , Pete believed he would never die . Even when the hard village stopped enduring , Whistling Pete would n't . <p> " Men may build the cities , " Pete said softly , just before they arrived at his white doorway , his paved driveway , his leaning mailbox , " but believe you me . It 's the little girlies who make us live in them . " <p> Despite his protestations to the contrary , Pete arrived home each night aching with apology and self-reproach . <p> " I know I should have called , " he told her . " I know it 's late , and I forgot to buy milk again . And yes I did drink too much , and spent too much money , and Little Petey 's gone to bed again without kissing Daddy good night . I 'm sorry , Estelle , I really am . I 'm sorry but I ca n't seem to explain . Some nights I just have to get away with my buddies , have a few drinks and unwind . No , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish I could , Estelle , but I ca n't . " <p> Later , in bed , Estelle pretended to sleep . Pete could feel the slow breath of the hard house around them , the ticking radiators and ruminating clocks . Next door in the nursery , Little Petey , true to his genotype , faintly whistled while he snored . <p> " I 'll try to be better , " Whistling Pete told his wife , pretending he believed her when she pretended not to hear . " But that does n't mean I 'm going to . Maybe I can tell you what you want to hear , Estelle . But that does n't mean I can be somebody I 'm not . " <p> Then , too tired for remorse , he fell asleep with a hypnagogic little kick . And descended into the dreams he pretended not to know . <p> " Of course I worry about Estelle and Junior , " Buster told his wife that night , tossing and turning among the knotted sheets and lumpy pillows . " But Pete 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to lie here and listen while you trash him . " <p> " Trash him ? " Sandy said , in a rising crescendo of disbelief . " I 'm trashing him ? " <p> Buster turned onto his other side and gazed out the bare , glistening window . The full moon glared at him like a primitive mandala ; Buster could feel the cold , deep resonance in his bones Like a hum . <p> " What about Estelle , huh ? Who 's trashing her , Buster ? Who 's doing the serious emotional trashing in this morbid little scenario of ours ? Me , or your close friend , Whistling Pete ? " <p> Buster submitted with something like relief . Sandy was like a geyser or an earth tremor . He could hear her about to happen all day , charging the dark air with rumor and electricity . <p> " So I guess poor little Estelle is supposed to grin and bear it  --  is that what you mean ? Because if she calls her wonderful husband a liar and a cheat then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a louse  --  which is exactly what he is , Buster  --  then I 'm trashing him too ? I guess if it 's a man doing the trashing then that makes it O.K. , huh ? Is that what you 're saying , Buster ? If men trash women , then that 's the proper order of things , right ? " <p> Buster took a long deep breath and sighed . <p> " That 's not what I said , Sandy . That 's not what I said and you know it . " <p> Every morning after a fight , breakfast became a ceremony of courtesy and toast . While Sandy brought in bottles of frozen milk from the front porch and thawed them on the stove , Buster took up the sports page and read through yesterday 's skating and ice-hockey scores , enjoying the cool comfort of abstractions , a sort of rousing statistical hum . Click , clicka-click-click . Clicka-click-click . <p> " I 'm going shopping , " Sandy said flatly , peering at him across her china teacup . <p> " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the wall clock . <p> In another few minutes he might be able to leave for work without appearing too obvious . <p> " I 'm getting a beak trim and a pedicure at Valerie 's . Then I 'm meeting Estelle for lunch at the Green Kitchen . " <p> Buster felt the weight of depth charges hidden beneath the surface of Sandy 's blithe words . He refused to look up from his paper . <p> " Have a nice time , honey , " he said . " I should be home by dinner . " <p> Later , traipsing back up the long winding road to the Factory , Buster rehearsed his concern until it resembled indignation . He gestured severely with his red metal lunchpail . <p> " Enough 's enough , buddy , " he said . " And believe me  --  I 'm telling you this for your own good . If you want a little fling now and then , that 's cool . But these daily rallies of yours are getting to be too much . Show a little discretion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or something ? Happy flappers lying out on the beach all day , mating indiscriminately , barking like morons ? No , Pete , we 've built something for ourselves out here . Homes and schools and factories and jobs . So if you want to shoot off your mouth about how rotten civilization is and all , well , that 's your prerogative . But if you 're going to continue living here , then you 've got to start taking responsibility for yourself . I hate to be so hard on you , bro '  --  believe me , I do n't like it anymore than you do . But I 'm being hard on you because I care . And if you do n't understand that , well , just forget it . Maybe I 've been wasting my time with you all along . " <p> Steaming with resolution , Buster chugged into the Factory just as the second whistle blew . Grizzly fishermen were dragging weirs-full of squirming carp and tuna from the harbor while the Factory gates were rolled open by large , muscly-looking penguins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached Pete 's office he knew he was finally going to do it . He was going to tell Whistling Pete what he thought about him once and for all . The hot energized words carried him up the stairs and down the hall . They carried him through Payroll , Group Insurance and Personnel , past filing cabinets , bulletin boards and water fountains . Buster was finally going to speak his mind , come hell or high water . Or perhaps he was just going to let the unrestrainable anger in his mind speak for itself . <p> Inside Pete 's office , Nadine , the Accounts secretary , was stirring a big pot of tea with a wooden spoon . <p> " Let me speak to Whistling Pete , " Buster told her . " And tell him I mean muy pronto . " <p> Nadine took a moment to understand . She looked at Buster , then at the open door to Pete 's office . She was smiling faintly , as if she had been expecting this pathetic little display all morning . <p> " Sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buddy 's not around . " Then she placed the teapot on a wooden tray alongside four chipped ceramic mugs , one tarnished teaspoon and a bowl of brown , lumpish sugar . " If there 's an emergency , though  --  and it better be one hell of an emergency  --  you can always leave a message for him at the Crystal Palace Motel . " <p> 3 . Mordida Girls <p> Spring returned and the squat white sun would n't leave , skating round the horizon 's meniscus of thinning ice and dripping mountains like a sentry . Time grew increasingly diffuse , gray and immeasurable . <p> Not that time mattered to Whistling Pete anymore  --  only the quick lapse into timelessness he regained every afternoon in the arms of his adorable Penguinettes . Often he trysted two or three of them on a single afternoon , bang bang bang , beginning each session with a few shots of Jack Daniels and a plate of imported caviar . Often by the third or fourth session he fell rudely asleep and dreamed of white , sandy beaches and tropical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the windows hung with thick black curtains like a shroud , and heard the hissing radiators . Sometimes his latest Penguinette was sitting in front of the vanity mirror gazing dreamily into the vertex of her own multiple reflections . <p> Usually , though , Whistling Pete awoke to an empty room laced with perfume and musk . Hotel personnel knocked summarily at the door . <p> " Maid service , " said a woman with a heavy Dutch accent . " Should we clean up , Mister ? Or you want we should come back later ? " <p> By the time Pete waddled into work it was often as late as three or three-thirty . Fellow administrators and their assistants looked up distantly when Pete skirted through the halls . Back in Accounts his assistant , Nadine , was always in a furious temper . <p> " Mr. Oswald came by from Marketing , and Joe Wozniak asked again about your expense receipts . I 've tried covering for you as far as the sales conference , but I ca n't do anything if I do n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your wife and little boy popped round asking for you  --  you were supposed to take your son fishing today . I think you blew it , Pete . " <p> " Oh shit , " Whistling Pete said , and slumped into his swivel chair . He checked both his vest pockets for stray cigarettes but located only twisted bits of tobacco and a small white business card . The card said : <p> Henrieta Philpott <p> Public Relations Consultant . <p> He wondered if he and Henrietta had spent any time together . Or if maybe they were about to . <p> " I knew I 'd forgotten something , " Whistling Pete said . <p> He knew but he could n't quite bring himself to care . He had passed through a barrier of some sort , and was now journeying fearlessly into some primitive wilderness of the mind penguins were n't supposed to know . Cold black spaces where the sun never got to . Huge white polar bears roaming about , cracking shellfish against rocks . Dark hot shapes swooping overhead while strange animals cried in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journeyed this far south , the old rules did n't apply . The only thing you could do was keep moving forward and never look back . <p> Pete continued making excuses , but they felt more like formalities than contentions . <p> " But I 'm going to take Junior fishing , " Pete declared , with a forced sincerity even he did n't recognize . " I want to help teach him to fish . But I got delayed meeting a distributor on the Stroud Islands . What do you want me to do  --  neglect my job ? " <p> " I sure would n't want that , " Estelle said emptily , leaning against the kitchen table . She held a Mackerel-Cracker in front of her face like a cue card . " Obviously , neglecting your job 's all you 're worried about anymore . So tell that to your year-old son who adores you . " <p> " I 'll make it up to you , sport  --  I really will . " Pete paced back and forth in the living room while Junior lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Our Polar World , Twelfth Edition ) . " We 'll go camping , that 's it . A weekend on the Outer Orkneys . Just you , me and those mackerel . We 'll bring along that new sealskin pup tent we 've been meaning to use . " <p> Junior did n't look up . He tapped a pencil against his beak , and turned the page of his textbook . In the last few months since being weaned , Junior 's body had grown angular and weirdly composed . It was n't a body Pete entirely recognized anymore . <p> " Like , that 's cool , Dad . It 's no big deal or anything . We 'll go fishing some other time . When you 're not so busy , that is . " <p> " I 've got the expense receipts , " Pete told the Executive Staff in the Factory Green Room . " Of course I 've got the expense receipts . " The Executive Directors had called him in during lunch break . They sat around the long black conference table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's just that , well , Payroll screwed up the Group Finance Report , and by the time Nadine and I got that mess straightened out with the Commissary it was time for the Monthly Service Catalog , and , well , I know it sounds like a bunch of half-assed excuses and all . . . " A bright cold sweat broke out on Pete 's forehead ; he tried to shake a little ventilation into his facial feathers and felt a faint dizzying rush , as if he were falling through vortices of warm air . " . . . and of course I 'll get the reports to you by Friday , and I do n't like to sound like I 'm trying to divert blame or anything , right , ' cause of course Nadine 's a great girl and all , bur she does have something of a temperament . I 'm not trying to cast aspersions or anything but I mean , like , she 's always blaming everything on the system , right , and the male-dominated patriarchy and all that , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nadine to cooperate as far as her official responsibilities are concerned . I 'm not blaming Nadine for all the screwups , understand . I 'm just saying there 's only so much I can do , right ? I 've only got two flippers , you know . " <p> But no matter how hard Whistling Pete expostulated , prevaricated and fibbed , he knew the game was coming to a rapid conclusion . Even though he 'd ordered a new company-account checkbook only two weeks ago , he had already used it all up . He 'd paid last month 's motel , room service , and bar bills , but now this month 'S bills were beginning to fall due , and Finance would n't be forthcoming with another checkbook until May . Pete had purchased a half-dozen pearl necklaces , brooches and earrings , but could n't even remember which Penguinettes he had distributed them to , or for how much in return . He journeyed through each day in a weird sort of somnambulism , never certain of the time , suffering sinus headaches and blurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bathroom-cabinet mirror . <p> A line from an old Dylan song kept recurring to him : " To live outside the law you must be honest . " What Pete decided was : To live outside the law you must work really , really hard . He awoke every day at seven , gulped black coffee , and hurried to the Factory where he unsuccessfully tried to catch up with the work he 'd been neglecting for weeks . Then he fell asleep at his desk , awoke to Nadine 's pottering , and skipped off in a faint anxiety rush to the Crystal Palace Motel , where he encountered the silk-clad bodies of Stella , Ariadne , Velma and Chloe . Then he returned home each evening through a slow dull daze of incertitude , to be greeted by unpaid utility bills , humming kitchen appliances and stiff , intricate silences . Estelle in bed with her book . Junior out gallivanting with his friends . <p> Some nights Pete found the bedroom door bolted shut and he knocked politely like a timid solicitor . <p> " Estelle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in there ? " <p> " Of course I 'm in here . " <p> " Can I come in ? " <p> " No you ca n't . " <p> " I 'm really bushed , Estelle . I need to lie down and sleep . " <p> " So sleep on the couch . " <p> " I feel very strange , you know , all run down and everything . I 've got stomach pains , my liver 's enlarged , there may even be something wrong with my spleen . I 've got a rash on my inner thigh that burns like crazy . I 'm really beat , Estelle , and I think , well . Maybe we should talk . " <p> " There 's nothing to talk about , " Estelle said with calm conviction , as if she were slipping a form letter under the door . " I 'm afraid the time for talking is over . " <p> Her voice was clipped and regular , like the Factory 's canning machine . Whistling Pete leaned against the flimsy plywood door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radium or metal . It felt very far away , divided from him by distances more extensive than space . <p> " Oh Estelle , " Pete sighed , feeling his entire body slump into itself like an expiring party balloon . " Maybe you 're right , honey . Maybe you 're right . " <p> " If you do n't mind my saying so , Pete  --  you 're starting to look pretty thin and unraveled lately . " <p> Melody was sitting on the edge of the mattress and pulling on her baggy white fishnet stockings . <p> " I 'll do what I can , " Whistling Pete said dreamily . He imagined himself floating downriver on a wide jagged platform of ice . He was gazing up at the white sky , the thin white sun and moon . <p> Melody gazed distantly at her herself in the shimmering vanity mirror . <p> " You 're starting to lose a little of your , oh , what do you call it ? Your getup-and-go . I do n't mean to sound impolite or anything , baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I just do n't look forward to seeing you anymore . I mean , when I know we 've got a date coming up  --  oh , how do I say this ? Knowing I 've got to see you is getting to be a big bummer . " <p> Melody anchored the tops of her stockings to a matching pair of elasticized red-velvet garters . Her body gave off thin , languorous heat and a sense of benign inattention . <p> " Even General Motors suffers an occasional financial slump , " Whistling Pete said , smiling fondly at the clock on the wall . " Even the Japanese experience an occasional recession . " <p> Melody pulled on her short black cocktail skirt with a wriggle . She scowled faintly at herself in the mirror as if she remembered something anterior to her own reflection . Some memory which did not belong to this face , these eyes , this body , this occupied and lonely room . <p> " I worry about you , Pete . I really do . You used to be fun . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the old Whistling Pete I used to know ? " <p> Drifting in the direction towards which all currents yearned , Pete saw empty planes of ice , tall white mountains , gaping crevasses , rust-red lichen the size of dinner plates . We 've lived for thousands and thousands of years , the lichen collectively muttered . And want to know what 's happened out here in all that time ? <p> Nothing , man . Nothing nothing nothing nothing . <p> " I 'll be fine , " Pete said . He reached for his glass of Smirnoff 's . " A bit of the bug , probably . I 've been working too hard . I need to relax . " <p> " Yeah , well . " Melody got up and brushed herself off . She was wearing a lot of crushed black velvet and pink powdery body-blush . " You take care of yourself , Petey , because I worry about you , I really do . But until you get your act together , I think maybe we should n't see each other for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Motel <p> Buster sat at the Ice Floe sipping a strawberry margarita while Al the portly bartender swabbed everything down with a damp dishcloth . <p> " He 's been over there every night , " Al said . He shifted a toothpick from one side of his beak to the other , and nodded in the general direction of the Crystal Palace Motel . " Every day and night , actually . And when he comes in here  --  usually for another bottle of Smirnoff 's  --  he does n't say hi or anything . He just takes what he needs and leaves . " <p> " No skin off my butt , " Buster said , and lit another menthol cigarette . <p> Buster had recently taken up smoking , just to give his hands something to do . " He does n't need my help with anything . He 's got his little girlies to keep him company . " <p> " Little girlies , " Al said , and poured himself a soda water from the hand-dispenser . " Little girlies and God knows what else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaze abstractedly across the empty restaurant . It was three P.M. and Buster had just finished a late lunch of oysters in clam sauce . <p> " And God knows what else , " Al said again . He refused to look at Buster , and there was something in this refusal that Buster took as a reproach . <p> After lunch and a second margarita Buster tried calling Pete 's room at the Crystal Palace Motel but there was n't any answer . When he stopped by the lobby on his way back to work he found the day clerk playing a new hand-held electronic ice-hockey game . The day clerk swung the beeping computer toy back and forth , as if he were steering a particularly nasty slalom down the rocky hillsides of his imagination . <p> " Is Whistling Pete still in Room 408 ? " Buster asked . Buster lit a fresh cigarette off the old one and crushed the old one out in a hip-high , sand-filled aluminum ashtray . <p> " Ah shit , " the day clerk said . <p> The computer beeped its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Whistling Pete , huh ? " He gave Buster the once-over . " He 's not the sort of guy who has many friends . So you must be another customer , right ? " <p> Before he knew what he was doing , Buster was lifting the stroppy , bell-hatted little penguin up over the countertop and slamming him rudely against the clattery ashtray . <p> " What 's that supposed to mean , Numb-nuts ? " <p> " Hey , I was just kidding , is all . " <p> Buster heard a tone in his own voice he did n't recognize . <p> " I 'll ask you one more time , " he said simply , " and do n't give me any more blather . Just tell me where can I find my friend , Whistling Pete ? " <p> By the time Buster found him he wished he had n't . The day clerk had come clean , and as a result left Buster feeling irredeemably dirty . <p> " You know what I 'm talking about , Mister  --  do n't play Baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hitching up his uniform blue-serge slacks with a pompous little swagger . " I 'm talking seals , man . Otters . Big slimy lady walruses with fat blundery arses . It 's like the Tart 's Grand National around here  --  them strutting their stuff up and down those stairs day after day . And your pal , Mr. Pete , he does n't even leave the room at all anymore . You ca n't imagine the sort of disgusting activities that 're going on in there . It 's sick , that 's what it is . There should be a police ordinance or something . Not to mention his hotel tab , which has gotten completely out of hand . In another couple days , your old buddy 's going to find himself tossed out on the tundra with the wolves and the polar bears . " <p> Pete 's room had recently been relocated to the second-floor servants ' quarters . Buster took the service elevator and arrived at a long angular hallway dingy with infrequent lighting , where the linty velour carpets emitted a greasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spoiled vegetables . <p> When Buster knocked at Room 7 , he heard a slow slumberous rouse from deep inside . <p> Buster coughed awkwardly . Then he knocked again . <p> " Yeah , well , It 's not paradise , " Pete conceded . " But then , who 's looking for paradise , right ? " He was sitting on the edge of his frayed , sunken mattress , scratching his genitals through tatty checkered boxer shorts . The room was littered with bottles , newspapers , and fast-food wrappers . <p> " Why do n't you take a shower , Pete . Put on some clean underwear , for godsake . Then I 'll take you home to your wife and kid . " <p> " My wife and kid are history , Buster . Estelle took Junior to her sister 's on the Fimbul Ice Shelf . " <p> Buster refused to be deterred . If Pete was ever again to have faith in himself , Buster would have to be the one to teach him how . <p> " First we 'll get you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll go bring her back . She still loves you , Pete . I know she does . " <p> " Bring her back to what ? " Pete asked . His voice and eyes were phlegmy and aimless . He picked a white sticky substance from his ear and wiped it on the mottled sheets . " What 's left of me ai n't exactly a work of art , you know . And you must have heard about the expense money I embezzled . Nadine getting fired for my incompetence and graft . The fact that I 've lost what little reputation and self-respect I had left  --  and the funny thing is , I do n't give a goddamn . I do n't miss any of it . Especially not the self-respect . " <p> Buster , embarrassed by the false assurances he was tempted to offer , looked away . He saw the messy bathroom , the broken dripping toilet , towels on the floor . <p> " We 'll find you a new job , " Buster said . The lie echoed hollowly in the filthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll get you back on your feet again . Hell , buddy  --  I can loan you a few bob till you get yourself straightened out . What are friends for , huh ? " <p> " Oh Buster , " Pete sighed . " Wake up and smell the coffee , will you ? " Pete indicated his entire body with a small ironic flourish . The high strain of ribs , the frazzled patchy feathers , the haunted and thinning gleam in his eyes . " All my nice sleek body fat has melted away . No job , no family , no savings to speak of . It 's quite ironic , really . Because civilization has given me the luxury of thinking , I 've had time to disrespect all the civilized comforts that allow me to think . " <p> " Do n't , " Buster said . He knew he was in trouble if Pete started talking . " Stop it , Pete . Stop winding yourself up . " <p> Pete was on his feet again , waddling back and forth in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't it ? What do you build when you build yourself a civilization ? Nice warm houses , nice warm restaurants , nice warm places to go to the bathroom . What does civilization give us , Buster ? Temperature . Heat . Oxygen . Light . And what do we do with all this , this energy , this year-round fat and reserve ? We burn it , pal . We use it to stoke the fire of our bodies all day and all night . Heat and oxygen fuels the brain to think , the loins to procreate , the body to consume . We are burners of hard fuel , Buster , and thinkers of hard thoughts , and we ca n't ever rest until we die . Civilization does n't solve problems , Buster . It reminds us of all the problems we have n't yet solved . What we do n't have . Who we have n't been . How much we have n't spent . How many little girlies we have n't plugged . It does n't end , Buster . I keep thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not really . " <p> " Do n't do this to yourself , buddy , " Buster said desperately . " Turn it off , man . Give yourself a good swift kick in the backside and shut your damn brain off . " <p> Pete came to a sudden halt and he turned . His face was sunken , his eyes lit with a fire that burned itself as much as the things it saw . <p> " But Buster , " he said , " the only way to turn it off is to stop living . The only way to forget what you know is to pretend not to be . " <p> At which point , Whistling Pete fell to the floor with a terrible crash . <p> With friends from the Ice Floe Buster managed to transport Pete back to his home , where the atmosphere had grown stale , sluggish and unreal , almost as bleak as Pete 's room at the Crystal Palace . The walls , beds and furniture were icy with neglect and disuse . The pilot light had extinguished in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the impact of a recent storm , permitting an avalanche of rocky ice and sludge to build up around the dressing table . The only whiff of life remaining in the entire house was exuded by the bowels of the refrigerator , where shriveled vegetables and garlic bulbs blossomed . When they laid Pete out on the cold bed , he tossed and turned in his sleep , muttering against the tide of visions only he could save himself from . Buster was n't able to reactivate the pilot light in the furnace , but he did manage to get a good blaze started in the fireplace . <p> " More , " Whistling Pete murmured , drifting in the depths of oceans much deeper than sleep . " More yesterdays . More todays . More tomorrows . " <p> " Sleep tight , old buddy , " Buster said , posting himself in a cracked wooden chair beside the bed . He had just started a pot of canned soup simmering over the fireplace . " And if you need anything , you know where to find me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought she had to . <p> " Who 's your real wife , anyway ? " she asked him . " Me or Whistling Pete ? And since when did you take up cooking and housecleaning ? <p> never even seen you open a can of beans before . " <p> Buster was wearing one of Estelle 's frayed white aprons and scrubbing rusty pans in the sink . <p> " It 's just something I 've got to do , " Buster said . He felt strangely peaceful and solid . " If you love me , you 'll try to understand . " <p> " Try to understand , " Sandy said . Suddenly , like a wind snuffing out a candle , all the fight went out of her . " Try to understand . " <p> Buster took his overdue vacation time from the factory and repaired Whistling Pete 's window and furnace . Every afternoon , after preparing a lunch of chicken broth and fresh fruit salad , he helped Pete out of bed , walked him around the room a few times , and changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and desuetude , his complexion jaundiced and scabby . He was losing feathers all around his skull and under his armpits . <p> " We 'll get you a nice wool cap , " Buster promised one day during their exercise session . " The body loses ninety percent of its heat through the old skull , you know . In order to keep the body warm , you got ta keep your lid on  --  get me ? " <p> " That 's why we 've got gas fires , " Pete said . " That 's why we 've got central heating . " <p> " Go back to sleep now , " Buster said , laying him back in the cool fresh linen . " You do n't have anything to worry about for a long , long time . " <p> Usually Whistling Pete drifted off again , but some afternoons , as if driven by the momentum of his own feverish imaginings , he started talking out loud in his sleep . <p> " I dreamed all night of the white ice , " Whistling Pete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region of thin air and dazzling aurorae . I knew I was heading into the big nothing , but I could n't seem to stop myself . I knew I had to keep going , not because I wanted to get anywhere specific , but because I could n't bear to remain anywhere I already was . " <p> The dreams seemed to increase in force and volume , and Buster could never decide whether this was a good omen or a bad one . Sitting beside Pete 's bed with his newspaper , Buster watched his friend toss and turn with slow , gathering intensity , like a kettle heating on a stove . Sometimes he cried out or started upright and Buster soothed him with a steaming wet towel . <p> " Human beings are the next step , " Whistling Pete cried out from time to time . " They 'll be here any day now . And if human beings do n't get here pretty soon , then I 'm afraid us penguins wo n't have a choice . We 'll start turning into human beings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girls , the beautiful girls . Big fat hairy human beings with guns , oil and machinery . We 'll start erecting supermarkets and shopping malls . We 'll drive like maniacs across the ice on motorbikes and mopeds . We 'll start shooting each other in the head , and chewing tobacco , and pissing on our own front stoops . I have seen the future , Buster . I have seen the future and it is us . Animals who ca n't stop themselves anymore . Animals who always want more than they 've already got . " <p> " It 's O.K. , Pete , " Buster said . He shook and repositioned the foam pillows , helping Pete subside back into them . " Stop worrying . Stop thinking and just relax . It 'll be O.K.  --  I promise . I 'll stick by you . All you 've got to do is get better , Pete . I 'll take care of everything . " <p> They buried Whistling Pete beside the pond where he first went fishing with his father . A lid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inserted into the frothy , secret currents beneath . The various attending penguins seemed too stunned , disoriented or angry to look at one another . On the fringes of the small crowd a few lonely , heavily veiled Penguinettes sobbed quietly into black satin handkerchiefs . <p> When the lid of ice was refitted into place a few words were said by each of Pete 's surviving friends and relatives . Usually they offered slow , awkward condolences like , " He will be missed , " or , " He was always a hard worker and good provider , " with a dull casual flourish , as if they were signing a form letter . The last person to take the mound was Pete 's father , who had swum in that morning from his retirement village on Carney Island . ( Pete 's mother had died two years previously in a freak skiing accident . ) <p> " Whistling Pete was a good boy , " his father said in a cracked , halting voice , trying to read from a sheet of foolscap in his trembling hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black wool stocking cap and wire-rim bifocals . " He was always polite to his parents . He always did well in school and helped his mother with the housework . Now maybe he exaggerated the truth every once in a while , but that 's just the way he was , I guess . He found the truth a little too boring , so he tried to embellish it a little , it was kind of like generosity . Pete always thought big . He was ambitious and talented . Ever since he learned to swim , he dreamed of going to faraway places and accomplishing great deeds . I remember when he was little , he was such an enthusiastic fisherman . He kept bringing home sacks and sacks of them , more fish than we could possibly eat in one modest household . So then he started giving away all the extra fish he caught to the poor homes and convalescent hospitals . He always gave that little bit extra to everything he did . Maybe some people considered it selfish . But I always thought he gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Mr. Pete paused to wipe a frozen teardrop from one eye and continued in a wet , quavering voice . " Maybe he made some mistakes when he grew up . He never visited his mother and me after we retired , but by then he had a family of his own , so I guess he just got too busy . But he was always good to me and his mother when he was little , and that 's , that 's ... " Abruptly , Mr. Pete began to sob . A hush fell over the mourners . Even some of the succinctly sobbing black-clad Penguinettes fell respectfully silent . <p> Buster stepped up and whispered something in Mr. Pete 's ear . <p> " No , no , I 'm O.K. , " Mr. Pete declared irritably , and shook his sheet of foolscap at Buster as if he were shooing flies . Then he wiped his glasses with the end of his stocking cap , folded the foolscap in half and slipped it into his vest pocket . <p> " I just wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and father when he was little , and that 's how I 'll always remember him . " <p> 5 . The Land of the Midnight Sun <p> Estelle and Junior moved back into the house and Whistling Pete 's father returned to his retirement village by the sea . With much stern and obvious ceremony , Buster and Sandy began making what they referred to as " a fresh start " together . They exchanged small occasional gifts on personal anniversaries and public holidays , and in the renewed silence of their co-op duplex apartment they cautiously maintained a tender , almost obstinate parity . <p> " No , sweetheart , " Buster would demur , leaning to grant her a kiss behind each ear . " This is my night to do the dishes again . You washed up two nights in a row last week . " <p> They sat in the living room every evening after dinner sipping Darjeeling , nibbling oven-hot gingerbread and listening to the BBC World Service . Old empires disintegrating in the Baltic , Adriatic , Sahara , South Africa , Taiwan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strut of presidents , businessmen , pretenders and kings . " Before civilization , " Whistling Pete used to say , " we never had time to realize what we did n't have . Now we 've got all the time in the world to worry about what we 'll never keep . " Sitting with Sandy in the recently redecorated living room , Buster often felt Pete 's voice sneak up behind him like a physical presence . It was a summons to attend conversations never conducted , a simple memory of resonance . <p> In the mornings before work Buster took long aimless walks into the wilderness , wrapped tight in his sealskin parkas and scratchy woolen underdrawers . He knew this was the dream Pete had died trying to realize , and that if he tried to realize it himself then he would have to die , too . Not a dream of comfort or plenitude , but a sort of homeless insufficiency , a careless surfeit of the blood 's pulse and circuit . Buster ascended mountains and forded rivers . He skated across plains of ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some mornings he got lost and arrived late for work . He received three warnings and one official reprimand . One more tardy report or no-show , they told him , and he would be fired , no explanations asked . <p> That night at home , Sandy tried to understand . <p> " Do you know what you 're doing ? " she asked . Sandy had lit soft candles and prepared a cheese souffle . She wore a string of pearls , rubber pedal pushers and a Dacron shower cap  --  a combination she knew looked really good on her . <p> " Not really , " Buster said . He sat beside the fireplace and waited . He did n't know what he was waiting for anymore , he only knew it would be here soon . " I try not to worry too much , though . If it happens , it happens . I 'll get another job . I 'll do the best I can . " <p> " I 'll do the shopping again tomorrow if you like . Is there anything special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment as if it : were an especially tricky parable . <p> " Not really , " he said . " These days it 's hard for me to think too much about tomorrow . " <p>
