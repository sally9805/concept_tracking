Winter is a long time coming on this god-forsaken planet , and it stays too long , too . I watched a sudden gust blow a line of cold foam across the grey lake and thought about Earth , not for the first time that day . The two warm winters in San Diego when I was a boy . Even the bad winters in Nebraska . They were at least short . Maybe we were too quick to say no , when the magnanimous zombies offered to share Earth with us , after the war . We did n't really get rid of them , coming here . Cold radiated from the windowpane . Marygay cleared her throat behind me . " What is it ? " she said . " Looks like weather . I ought to check the trotlines . " " Kids will be home in an hour . " " Better I do it now , dry , than all of us stand out in the rain , " I said . " Snow , whatever . " " Probably snow . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After twenty years she torrid tell when I did n't want company . I pulled on wool sweater and cap and left the rain slicker on its peg . I stepped out into the damp hard wind . It did n't smell like snow coming . I asked my watch and it said 90 percent rain , but a cold front in the evening would bring freezing rain and snow . That would make for a fun meeting . We had to walk a couple of klicks , there and back . Otherwise the zombies could look through transportation records and see that all of us paranoids had converged on one house . We had eight trotlines that stretched out ten meters from the end of the dock to posts I 'd sunk in the chest-deep water.Two more had been knocked down in a storm ; I 'd replace them come spring . Two years from now , in real years . It was more like harvesting than fishing . The blackfish are so dumb they 'll bite anything , and when they 're hooked and thrash around , it attracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guyoh , look ! Somebody 's head on a nice shiny hook ! " When I got out on the dock I could see thunderheads building in the east , so I worked pretty fast . Each trotline 's a pulley that supports a dozen hooked leaders dangling in the water , held to one-meter depth with plastic floaters . It looked like half the floaters were down , maybe fifty fish . I did a mental calculation and realized I 'd probably just finish the last one when Bill got home from school . But the storm was definitely coming . I took work gloves and apron off a hook by the sink and hauled the end of the first line up to the eye-level pulley wheel . I opened the built-in freezerthe stasis field inside reflected the angry sky like a pool of mercuryand wheeled in the first fish . Worked it off the hook , chopped off the head and tail with a cleaver , threw the fish into the freezer , and then rebaited the hook with its head . Then rolled in the next client . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been getting for more than a year . They 're streaked with pink and have a noxious hydrogen-sulfide taste . The blackfish wo n't take them for bait and I ca n't even use them for fertilizer ; you might as well scatter your soil with salt . Maybe an hour a dayhalf that , with the kids helpingand we supplied about a third of the fish for the village . I did n't eat much of it myself . We also bartered corn , beans , and asparagus , in their seasons . Bill got off the bus while I was working on the last line . I waved him inside ; no need for both of us to get all covered with fish guts and blood . Then lightning struck on the other side of the lake and I put the line back in anyhow . Hung up the stiff gloves and apron and turned off the stasis field for a second to check the catch level . Just beat the rain . I stood on the porch for a minute and watched the squall line hiss its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started a small fire in the kitchen fireplace . Bill was sitting there with a glass of wine . That was still a novelty to him . " So how are we doing ? " His accent always sounded strange when he first got back from school . He did n't speak English in class or , I suspected , with many of his friends . " Over the sixty percent mark , " I said , scrubbing my hands and face at the work sink . " Any better luck and we 'll have to eat the damned things ourselves . " " Think I 'll poach a big bunch for dinner , " Marygay said , deadpan . That gave them the flavor and consistency of cotton . " Come on , Mom , " Bill said . " Let 's just have them raw . " He liked them even less than I did . Chopping off their heads was the high point of his day . I went to the trio of casks at the other end of the room and tapped a glass of dry red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire . I poked at it with a stick , a social gesture probably older than this young planet . " You were going to have the art zombie today ? " " The art history Man , " he said . " She 's from Centrus . Have n't seen her in a year . We did n't draw or anything ; just looked at pictures and statues . " " From Earth ? " " Mostly . " " Tauran art is weird . " That was a charitable assessment . It was also ugly and incomprehensible . " She said we have to come to it gradually . We looked at some architecture . " Their architecture , I knew something about . I 'd destroyed acres of it , centuries ago . Felt like yesterday sometimes . " I remember the first time I came across one of their barracks , " I said . " All the little individual cells . Like a beehive . " He made a noncommital noise that I took as a warning . " So where 's your sister ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same bus . " I ca n't keep her schedule straight . " " She 's at the library , " Marygay said . " She 'll call if she 's going to be late . " I checked my watch . " Ca n't wait dinner too long . " The meeting was at eight and a half : " I know . " She stepped over the bench and sat down between us , and handed me a plate of breadsticks . " From Snell , came by this morning . " They were salty and hard ; broke between the jaws with an interesting concussion . " I 'll think him tonight . " " Old folks party ? " Bill asked . " Sixday , " I said . " We 're walking , if you want the floater . " " But do n't drink too much wine , ' " he anticipated , and held up his glass . " This is it . Volleyball down at the gym . " " Win one for the Gipper . " " What ? " " Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a gipper is . " " Sounds like a position , " he said . " Server , spiker , gipper . " As if he cared a lot about the game qua game . They played in the nude , mixed , and it was as much a mating ritual as a sport . A sudden blast of sleet rattled against the window . " You do n't want to walk through that , " he said . " You could drop me off at the gym . " " Well , you could drop us off , " Marygay said . The route of the floater was n't registered ; just the parking location , supposedly for call forwarding . " Charlie and Diana 's place . They wo n't care if we 're early . " " Thanks . I might score . " He did n't mean volleyball . When he used our ancient slang I never knew whether it was affection or derision . I guess when I was twenty-one I could do both at the same time , with my parents . A bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the weather . The front door opened and shut fast , and she ran upstairs to change . " Dinner in ten minutes , " Marygay called up the stairs . She made an impatient noise back . " Starting to bleed tomorrow , " Bill said . " Since when do brothers keep track of that , " Marygay said . " Or husbands ? " He looked at the floor . " She said something this morning . " I broke the silence . " If there are any Men there tonight ... " " They never come . But I wo n't tell them you 're off plotting . " " It 's not plotting , " Marygay said . " Planning . We 'll tell them eventually . But it 's a human thing . " We had n't discussed it with him or Sara , but we had n't tried to keep them from overhearing . " I could come someday . " " Someday , " I said . Probably not . So far it was all first-generation ; all vets , plus their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were born on this thing Man had called a " garden planet , " when they gave us a choice of places to relocate after the war . We usually called " our " planet MF . Most of the people who lived here were dozens of generations away from appreciating what we 'd meant by " middle finger . " Even if they did know , they probably did n't connect the acronym with the primal Oedipal act . After living through an entire winter , though , they probably called the planet their cultures ' versions of " motherfucker . " MF had been presented to us as a haven and a refugeand a place of reunion . We could carve out an existence here as plain humans , without interference from Man , and if you had friends or lovers lost in the relativistic maze of the Forever War , you could wait for them on the Time Warp , a converted battlewagon that shuttled back and forth between Mizar and Alcor fast enough to almost halt aging . Of course it turned out that Man did want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sort of genetic insurance policy . They could use us as a baseline if , after X generations , something bad cropped up in their carbon-copy genetic pattern . ( I once used that term with Bill , and started to explain , but he did know what carbon copies were . Like he knew what cave paintings were . ) But they were n't passive observers . They were zookeepers . And MF did resemble a zoo : an artificial simplified environment . But the zookeepers did n't build it . They just stumbled onto it . Middle Finger , like all the Vega-class planets we 'd found , was an anomaly and a cartoon . It defied normal models of planetary formation and evolution . A too-young bright blue star with a single planet , Earth-sized with oxygen-water chemistry . The planet orbits at a distance where life can be sustained , if only just . ( Planet people tell us that there 's no way to have an Earthtype planet unless you also have a Jupiter-type giant in the system . But then stars like Vega and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has seasons , but they 're provided not by inclination toward the sun , but by the long oval of its orbit . We have six seasons spread over three Earth years : spring , summer , fall , first winter , deep winter , and thaw . Of course the planet moves slower , the farther it is from its sun , so the cold seasons are long , and the warm ones , short . Most of the planet is arctic waste or dry tundra . Here at the equator , lakes and streams ice over in deep winter . Toward the poles , lakes are solid permanent ice from the surface down , with sterile puddles forming on warm summer days . Two-thirds of the planet 's surface is lifeless except for airborne spores and micro-organisms . The ecology is curiously simple , toofewer than a hundred native varieties of plants ; about the same number of insects and things that resemble arthropods . No native mammals , but a couple of dozen species and large small things that are roughly reptiles or amphibians . Only seven kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolved from anything else . There are no fossils , because there has n't been enough timecarbon dating says nothing on or near the surface is more than ten thousand years old . But core samples from less than fifty meters down reveal a planet as old as Earth . It 's as if somebody had hauled a planet here and parked it , seeded with simple life . But where did they haul it from , and who are they , and who paid the shipping bill ? All of the energy expended by the humans and the Taurans during the Forever War would n't have moved this planet far . It 's a mystery to them , too ; the Taurans , which I find reassuring . There are other mysteries that are not reassuring . Chief among them is that this corner of the universe had been inhabited before , up to about five thousand years ago . The nearest Tauran planet , Tsogot , had been discovered and colonized during the Forever War . They found the ruins of a huge city there , larger than New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husks of dozens of alien spaceships drifted in orbit , one of them an interstellar vessel . Of the creatures who had built this powerful civilization , not a clue . They left behind no statues or pictures , which may be explainable in terms of culture . Neither did they leave any bodies , not even a single bone , which is harder to explain . The Tauran name for them is Boloor , " the lost . " * * * I usually cooked on Sixday , since I did n't teach then , but the Greytons had brought by a couple of rabbits , and that was Marygay 's specialty , hassenpfeffer . The kids liked it better than most Earth food . They mostly preferred the bland native stuff , which is all they got at school . Marygay says it 's a natural survival trait ; even on Earth , children stuck to bland , familiar food . I had n't , but then my parents were strange , hippies . We ate fiery Indian food . I never tasted meat until I was twelve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dinner was amusing , Bill and Sara trading gossip about their friends ' dating and mating . Sara 's finally gotten over Taylor , who had been her steady for a year , and Bill had welcome news about a social disaster the boy had caused . It had stung her when he declared himself home , but after a few months ' fling he turned het again , and asked her to take him back . She told him to stick to boys . Now it turns out he did have a boyfriend over in Hardy , very secret , who got mad at him and came over to the college to make a loud public scene . It involved sexual details that we did n't used to discuss at the dinner table . But times change , and fun is fun .
