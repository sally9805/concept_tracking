<p> FAMILY <p> PLANNING <p> Editor  --  The Sierra Club 's Kenneth R. Hammond has the right idea but the wrong target ( Letters , January 6 ) . In spite of California 's severe budget deficits , Pete Wilson is the first governor in a decade to insist on increasing state contraceptive funding . Plus he has set aside an additional $ 7 million to offset the money California 's federally-funded contraceptive programs will lose because of the Reagan/Bush " gag rule . " <p> Where was the Sierra Club these last few months as we battled to overturn the " gag rule " against the mere mention of the " A word " in federally-funded contraceptive clinics ? Is the Sierra Club aware that federal contraceptive ( Title X ) programs have not received a cost-of-living increase in over a decade ? During this period , inflation has shrunk Title X 's purchasing power by two- thirds and over 1,000 Title X clinics have closed . Has the Sierra Club done anything about that ? For that matter , where was the Sierra Club in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico City " policy that virtually eliminated U.S. support of international family planning ? <p> We would welcome the significant involvement of the Sierra Club in the pro-contraceptive movement . Perhaps then , the Hammonds of the world would know where to aim their arrows . The deplorable fact is you ca n't get family planning money out of the White House , even if you 're a Republican governor of California . <p> HARRIETT STINSON , director <p> California Republicans for Choice <p> Burlingame <p> LATE ABORTIONS <p> Editor  --  After reading the article ( Chronicle , January 6 ) entitled " Painful Decisions in Late Abortions , " I can only say thank God for medical technology ! Thanks to sonograms , a woman no longer has to wait until after her baby is born before deciding the child has no chance for survival in the outside world . Gone are the days when babies with defects are left on cold hillsides to be killed by the harsh elements . Such action , of course , would be murder . No ! Thanks to concerned doctors such as Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , women can destroy tissue in their wombs up to the final trimester before birth . Forget the fact that this tissue feels as much pain as would a baby left upon a hillside . Forget the fact that this tissue has a strong possibility for survival outside the womb after maturing through the stages leading up to the final trimester . <p> The practice of aborting babies late in a pregnancy because of their probable inability to function successfully in society seems inhumane at best . Clinics such as the Boulder Abortion Clinic capitalize on society 's fear of individuals with handicaps . I fear the day when only the most intelligent , best looking and physically able will be given the chance to be born . <p> CAROLE A. STECHER <p> Burlingame <p> TWISTED LOGIC ? <p> Editor  --  Marilyn Chavez 's assertion ( Letters , January 9 ) that a couple having a third child was " selfish " and that " a lifetime of recycling and conservation wo n't begin to compensate for the negative impact on the environment of an additional child and her or his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misplaced priorities . Such nonsense damages the credibility of responsible environmentalists and allows opponents to dismiss us as " whacko . " <p> Ms. Chavez devalues human life by assessing its worthiness in terms of how much damage will be done by its existence . This is the same reasoning used by Adolf Hitler to first sterilize , then exterminate Jews . Hitler wanted to save the world for Aryans . Ms. Chavez wants to save it for first- and second-born children . <p> RICK LEMYRE <p> Brentwood ( Contra Costa County ) <p> WOOD HEATERS <p> Editor  --  Ron Sonenshein 's article , " Wood Stove Fad Going Up in Smoke " ( Chronicle , January 6 ) , offered a significantly one-sided and incomplete picture of residential wood burning in the Bay Area . <p> First , with an estimated 200,000 to 300,000 wood heaters in use in the Bay Area , wood stoves could hardly be called a " fad . " Second , it is essential to realize the importance of biomass fuels in our overall energy picture . No energy source is perfect , we went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas is a finite resource with an estimated 60-year supply at current consumption rates . If we start powering automobiles with LNG , that 60-year supply will dwindle rapidly . Coal presents its own emissions problems and nuclear power generates some of the most difficult waste by-product on Earth . Solar and wind technologies are not cost effective for residential users without supportive tax credits . Hydroelectric power requires destruction of rivers and reliable rain and snowfall . Wood heaters , on the other hand , provide economical comfort for millions of families across the nation using one of our only locally grown , renewable resources . <p> The most important point Sonenshein missed was that wood heat technology has now evolved to the point that current EPA certified stoves burn up to 10 times cleaner ( EPA 's own estimate ) than stoves produced only five years ago . The BAAQMD has recognized this in allowing EPA-certified stoves to burn during their voluntary " Do n't light tonight " burn curtailments . The state Air Resources Board has also recognized that encouraging wood heat users to convert to new technologies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air pollution that residential wood burning is responsible for . Three-hundred tons of " carbon monoxide and other particulates per day " from wood smoke , when compared to all other sources , is not a major contribution . <p> GUY FASANARO , vice president <p> Wood Energy Institute West <p> California/Nevada Chapter <p> ' THREATENED SPECIES ' <p> Editor  --  We in the north state have the spotted owl , marbled murrelet , as do our neighbors to the north , Oregon and Washington . <p> The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has designated 6.9 million acres as critical habitat , for the spotted owl 's survival . No decision on the marbled murrelet as of yet . After reading your article on the delta smelt ( Chronicle , January 9 ) , I must ask Representative Dannemeyer if his endangered critter is any more important than our endangered critter . What 's a little water , compared to millions of acres of trees , now off limits , to the industry that is one of the largest tax bases in the Pacific Northwest . May I throw this proposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it ? Since the job market in the lumber industry is looking bleaker by the day , I propose the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service designate lumber industry workers as an threatened species . Then the federal government could buy my property and home , and designate such as critical habitat for me , my wife and daughters , as we are quickly becoming a threatened species , in this beautiful place we call home . I think this would be the politically correct thing to do , since all decisions on the spotted owl were on a purely political basis . <p> JOHN PAUL NEWMAN <p> McKinleyville ( Humboldt County ) <p> LIVING ON WELFARE <p> Editor  --  In the January 4 letters to the editor , Sonja Fitz of Berkeley takes issue with my letter of December 26 . I only wished she had read the editorial that was the basis for my letter . She neglects to mention that minimum wage at $ 600 per month is before income taxes , Social Security , transportation , clothes , etc . These people do not get food stamps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to school , etc . But somehow they survive , do n't ask me how , but they are the ones who deserve our support . <p> One only has to read a few papers to read of the three generations of welfare recipients in one house to see this can be a way of life . Over 50 percent of welfare recipients are on the program over three years . This is indicative to me that the system is not working as it should be . Let 's fix this . Get a system that will work . <p> In the meantime , let 's give our support to those who are working to keep out of the welfare system . These are the people who need our support . I agree that no one in their right mind would use welfare as " a lifetime support system , " but please smell the coffee . Many do it , it 's a fact of life . I agree they ca n't have a house in the suburbs and a new car on welfare , but then not many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belmont <p> THEORIES ON JFK <p> Editor  --  I support the idea to declassify the 848 boxes of documents surrounding the JFK assassination and we should all write our representative to have the House declassify them . Just as a way to make peace with those who cry conspiracy . Perhaps we shall never know the truth . Likely we will disagree even when it is known . Our history tells us this is to be expected . <p> Venturing a guess , I doubt any revelations will be uncovered . I expect the information uncovered to support a dozen conflicting theories . Maybe it will disprove one . <p> JOHN PILGE <p> Santa Cruz
