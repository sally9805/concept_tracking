Let 's try to set the record straight . There has been a lot of controversy surrounding the topic of athletes and sex scandals . But the question is : Do the athletes look for trouble or does trouble find them ? History shows that the mighty men of sports in all arenas-basketball , boxing , baseball and football-seem to be at the center of contestable coitus encounters . Charlotte Hornets forward Anthony Mason , 31 , and his cousin were charged with statutory rape , sexual abuse and endangering the welfare of a child after they allegedly had consensual group sex with two sisters , ages 14 and 15 . The case remains open . After eight hours of deliberation , a jury found Jose Mesa , relief pitcher for the Cleveland Indians baseball team , not guilty of rape , two counts of gross sexual imposition and theft . A woman accused Dallas Cowboy offensive linebacker Erik Williams of sexually assaulting her while his teammate , Michael Irvin , pointed a gun at her head and videotaped the assault . Both Cowboy stars were proven innocent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the entire story . Although former World Heavyweight Boxing champion Mike Tyson insisted , " I did n't rape anyone , " a jury found him guilty of rape and deviate sexual conduct after a woman said he sexually attacked her . Tyson served a three-year prison term for his conviction . Photograph Anthony Mason Jose Mesa Photograph Erik Williams and Michael Irvin of the Dallas Cowboys were proven innocent once the woman who accused them of sexual assault admitted that she lied in a written confession . // And most recently , Juwan Howard and Chris Webber of the Washington Wizards basketball team have been accused by a woman of sexual assault . Athletes in all fields have fallen prey to accusations of sexual misconduct . Do these athletes put themselves in situations that can be prevented or are they targeted by women who are looking for more than just a good time ? When JET asked that question , a variety of opinions were given , but one common theme was present-sex scandals can be avoided . All athletes need to do is take heed of the forewarnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be selective about the company they keep . Charlie Parker , assistant coach for the Dallas Mavericks , said the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) enters all of its first- and second-draft rookies into a program that trains them to deal with topics that include sexual issues . " The training focuses a great deal on sexual issues , " said Parker , who 's been coaching for 25 years . " They tell them ball players the precautions and things they should be aware of while they are on the road . " Photograph Mike Tyson Charlie Parker , assistant coach for the Dallas Mavericks , said the NBA trains players on issues concerning sexual misconduct . Larry Hazard , NJ State Athletic Control Board/Boxing Commissioner , believes being involved in sex scandals " comes with the territory of being an athlete . " Juwan Howard and Chris Webber of the Washington Wizards have been accused of sexual assault . // Since the athletes are trained not to get in trouble , then why do they ? " The Boxing Commissioner " Larry Hazard says the answer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you have to chalk it up to being human , and also to being part of this male/female culture of attractiveness , " said the New Jersey State Athletic Board Control Commissioner . " You know men are attracted to women , and women are attracted to men . So suddenly when you the athletes have a lot of prestige , it gives you a greater level of access to women . " But on the other hand , Hazard also agrees that athletes are forewarned and should take necessary precautions not to get mixed up in scandals . Nevertheless , the temptation seems to be so overwhelming that a certain group of individuals fall victim . " They 've heard the warnings before . Mike Tyson has heard the warnings , " said Hazard . " I happened to have been one of those individuals who have told him the same thing that he 's heard time and time again from other people . " Photograph St. Louis Rams cornerback Ryan McNeil suggests that " athletes keep their guards up at all times " to prevent scandals . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the athlete is the one who ends up suffering the worst loss . In many cases they stand to lose millions of dollars in endorsements , and most of all their dignity and the respect of their fans . Ryan McNeil , 27 , cornerback for the St. Louis Rams football team , says , " The responsibility falls on the athlete because he has more to losemoney , name and fame . The athlete has to take precautions and delay gratification until you find out where that person is coming from . " Washington Redskins offensive guard Rod Milstead , 28 , says that it is n't fair how athletes are humiliated before they have even gone to trial . He cited Washington Wizards ' players Webber and Howard as examples of victims . Photograph Washington Redskins offensive guard Rod Milstead said , " It is n't fair how athletes are humiliated before they are proven guilty . " Photograph John Thompson , head coach for Georgetown University Men 's Basketball Team , says athletes can avoid scandals by using good judgment . // " It 's kind of sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Milstead . " Their whole lives have been violated , and from now on , whether they 've been charged or not , it goes down in history . It 's not fair . " Michael Irvin of the Dallas Cowboys fell victim to having his name slandered when he was falsely accused of sexual assault . After the woman admitted that she lied , Irving told the media , " Rerun it , rewrite it , reprint it . Just like you did , with the same intensity that you did . " Although many agree that athletes are targets for sex scandals , most concur that whatever situation in which sports figures find themselves in the middle , they are ultimately responsible for their own actions . Easier said than done ? Absolutely . Especially since as an athlete you 're obligated to be available to media , fans and friends . And sometimes this means trouble is lurking and waiting to happen to the average athlete who is just trying to enjoy himself . Georgetown University 's Head Basketball Coach John Thompson says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that you get accused of a lot of things because of who you are . " " Athletes are picked on , " said Thompson , " but they 're prepared to be picked on . They 're told from day one they will be set up . " So as the pendulum swings , the original question remains unanswered : Do athletes create the scandal or do the scandalous find them ? It 's only logical , as well as fair , to say that the answer falls evenly on either side . Both the athlete and his counterpart(s) are responsible for whatever consequences arise . And regardless of how chauvinistic it may seem , history does show that the majority of the time society will rule in favor of the woman when it comes to cases of sexual misconduct . As for the bottom line , most would agree with Coach Thompson 's theory : " The difference between being successful and unsuccessful is being prepared and using good judgment .
