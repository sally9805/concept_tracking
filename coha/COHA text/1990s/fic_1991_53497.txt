VINCENT AND PAUL repaired television sets . They worked in a windowless garage , light bulbs strung across the ceiling and disemboweled television sets piled up in the corners . Business was steady , but they needed help with their books . They had fallen behind with the billing , and neither one of them could get the bank statements to balance . Paul wanted his friend Laura to straighten things out . But Vincent did n't know Laura . He did n't like the idea . <p> " What do we want a woman in here for ? " Vincent said to Paul , scowling at the thought . <p> Paul was taking apart an old Zenith . " She would n't come here , " he said . " She works at her apartment . " <p> " In general , in general , " said Vincent . " I 'm talking general principles here . " <p> " Someone 's got to do it , " said Paul . <p> " The point is , why her ? " said Vincent . " Is she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old friend , " said Paul , bent over the Zenith . " A professional . " <p> " Probably looking for a boyfriend . " <p> " She 's already got one , " said Paul . " Allen . She lives with Allen . " <p> " I 'm the shy type , " said Vincent . " I know that , " said Paul . <p> " I have this effect on women . " <p> " We 've got a money problem here , Vincent , " said Paul , getting a little testy . " Let 's not worry about you and Laura . " <p> Vincent helped Paul lift the Zenith off the workbench . " I 'm just an old bachelor , " he said , half apologetically . In fact , he was bad-tempered and sometimes morose . He frightened women , he told Paul , with his huge frame , his shambling walk . He bad a wild way of rubbing up his hair until it stood on end and a confrontational sideways glare . The truth was Vincent was afraid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sorts . <p> Late that afternoon Vincent took the books and accounts up to Laura 's apartment . She and Allen kept a jug of Gallo in the kitchen corner and they offered him a glass but he refused . He dumped the papers , statements and bills and receipts , on the table and got out of there . <p> Paul must have told Laura about Vincent 's objections because she paid him many delicate attentions after she started the work , many small courtesies . " I 'm just an old bachelor , " Vincent protested early on and she smiled . Laura had a pretty smile , pretty dark hair . She consulted with him and flattered him . Eventually she won him over . He became playful and lively . He even made jokes of a ponderous nature : " Any time you get tired of Allen  --  " was one of his sallies , and Laura would smile and shake her head in response . Sometimes she would touch him on the shoulder with a slender hand ; Vincent could barely feel the touch through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Vincent assumed it was because Allen drank . When Paul told him she and Allen had not been getting along , he decided she drank because she was unhappy with Allen . <p> After Laura had been doing their books for several months , she came to see Vincent late one evening , climbed the stairs to his apartment and knocked on his door . She had never been there before , and he was quite unprepared for her visit . He stood by the door in his stocking feet , unshaven , wearing an ancient sweater , out-at-the-elbows and moth-holed . In fact , he was mortified by his unkempt appearance as well as by the disorder of the apartment . But , on the other hand , he was not surprised . Only the hour surprised him . <p> " Excuse the mess , " he said , ushering her in . He tried to keep his face expressionless , but he was so glad to see her that though he held down the corners of his mouth as tightly as he could , a smile kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " He went away , " she said , swaying a little . " Alien went away . " <p> " When is he coming back ? " he asked . Careful now , he told himself ; he almost held his breath because he sensed an incredible piece of luck coming his way and he wanted to be ready for it . <p> " Allen is not coming back , " she said slowly and clearly , as if she were talking to someone hard of hearing . " He moved out of town . " She took her coat off and folded it , and hung it over her arm . " Allen has left me , " she added . <p> " The bastard , " said Vincent . <p> " It 's OK , " she said . " It was n't any surprise . I knew it was coming . " <p> " I thought you two were so lovey-dovey . " <p> " Yes , well , you thought wrong . That was  --  I do n't know  --  an illusion . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this expression of Laura 's . <p> " Vincent , I want to ask you something . " <p> " Yes . " <p> " I want to ask you , would it be OK , " said Laura , " if I sat down ? " So Vincent pulled up the best chair in his shabby , slightly squalid apartment , tossing off the stuff piled up on the seat , dirty socks , old newspapers and magazines , the folded-up sweatshirt he used as a pillow , and eased it in closer for her to sit on . And finally she did sit down , slowly and judiciously , as if she were conferring a favor on him and on his apartment . Which , in a way , she was . <p> She was drunk , but he did n't care . It did n't bother him . They sat in companionable silence . <p> " Vincent , " she said after a while , " let 's not talk about Allen any more , OK ? Let 's forget about Alien . " <p> " Glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head back against his chair . She seemed to be resting . Vincent found himself holding his breath . It was as if a bird of a very rare and delicate sort had flown within his grasp . <p> She gave a deep sigh , maybe thinking a last thought about Allen , then sat up and began to peer around his apartment . He watched her carefully : what was she thinking about ; what would she do next ? " Oh Vincent , " she said finally , frightening and delighting him in equal measure , " this place needs a lot of work . " <p> There followed a period which Vincent then and later considered the happiest of his life . She moved in and cleaned up the place . She scrubbed windows and floors , hung curtains , and installed a beat-up Oriental rug she found in a thrift shop . Vincent gave his bedroom to Laura and slept on the couch in the sitting room . Laura made no comment about this arrangement , at least not initially . She moved her typewriter onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to type bills for Vincent and Paul and do their books . She even dunned some of their creditors . Meanwhile , she was gentle and affectionate with Vincent . Sometimes she touched him , pressing his back with the flat of her hand . Or she would take one of his large hands and hold it between her two smaller ones . <p> She stayed in the apartment most of the time , did her typing and accounting there , wrote out bills . She drank at home , too . She did n't like to go to bars , she told Vincent , did n't care for them . At first , Vincent , unfamiliar with her drinking pattern , believed she drank only moderately . " A medium-sized drinker " was the way he described her to Paul , who shook his head but made no comment . When Laura said that Allen had disapproved of her lifestyle , Vincent was indignant . He would never criticize her , he told her . In this way , he seemed to have agreed to protect her right to drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a hard promise to keep : as the days passed Vincent began to see that Laura drank more or less constantly . He would find empty juice glasses scattered around the apartment , under the sofa , on a window sill or a shelf in the bathroom . Sometimes she drank out of coffee mugs . Sometimes people thought she drank coffee out of coffee mugs . The wine would have no effect on her as far as Vincent could see ; she would be sensible , lively , lucid , then all at once she would turn ugly : incoherent and angry . She kept the bottles hidden somewhere ; Vincent never looked for them ( honoring his promise ) , but he often wondered where , in their small apartment , she managed to hide them . Friends , including Paul , would bring them for her ; she called it a " wine run . " She would call Paul up and say , " What about a wine run ; it 's time for a wine run , " and off Paul would go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Vincent could not help his heavy , disapproving looks . Every once in a while when he must have looked especially grim and censorious , she would brace him , " Come on , old Vin , " she would say , or if he kept it up , " Do n't be an asshole . " And he would put up with it . <p> But once she said , " I 'm going to get off the stuff one of these days . " They were sitting at the table  --  she with her wine-filled juice glass , Vincent and Paul with their beers . So when she said , " I 'm getting off the stuff , " he waited for Paul to congratulate her or say something encouraging . But Paul just kept on nodding and agreeing in a pleasant kind of way . Vincent wanted to jump in , tell her what a great idea it was , that he would help her , encourage her , but he was n't quick enough ; by the time he had framed a congratulatory sentence , Laura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were getting colder , Laura said ; she never used to feel the cold and now she wore two pairs of woolen socks and an extra sweater under her winter coat . Paul said he never could get warm on the really windy days , and Vincent had to add that it was as long a cold spell as he could remember . <p> Laura frightened him sometimes . She could joke about sex in a scary way : it was the drink , Vincent thought . Sometimes at night , late , after drinking wine all evening , she would start to take her clothes off in the kitchen , whereupon Vincent would hurry into the bathroom and close the door . Once , very drunk , she followed him in and began to pull the rest of her clothes off , dropping them on the floor where she stood . <p> " What are you doing that for ? " he asked her , scared to death . <p> " I was thinking I might take a bath , " she said , grinning away . <p> " Put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head away . <p> " You do n't want me because I 'm skinny . " <p> " It 's not that , " said Vincent . <p> " What then ? " She was teasing or taunting . " So what 's the problem here , Vincent ? " <p> " I 'm a lifelong bachelor , that 's the problem . I do n't know what to do with women . Put it back on , I said . " <p> She stood before him in her underpants . He could see the emaciation of her body , the sharp ridges of her collarbone , her breasts like small sacks strung against her ribcage , her bloated stomach . But her smile did not waver ; it contained something simultaneously seductive and threatening . Vincent did not know how to respond to her smile . <p> But other times she was gentle , understanding , called him " old Vinnie " when he said , " This is all beyond me . I 'm just an old bachelor . " <p> " It 's not anything I care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> But still . " Do n't you ever feel you 're missing something ? " she asked him once . <p> " Sex , you mean , " said Vincent . <p> " It 's kind of an unusual arrangement , " she said . <p> " It 's the best we can do , maybe . " <p> " Maybe , " she said , hoisting her coffee cup . <p> " We could settle for it . We could be happy . " <p> " Happy , " she croaked . But then she shrugged , " You know me , Vinnie , " she said , and it was as direct a reference to liquor as she ever made . <p> Once when she was sober , she said , " I do n't have much of anything , really . " <p> " You 've got me , " he said . <p> " I 've got you , " she agreed . <p> She looked out the window , studying the brick wall . Her typewriter had long since been pushed to the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not without rancor on the part of some of her clients . By this time Laura admitted she needed help . The question was , what kind of help was she willing to accept ? Vincent pushed A.A. <p> " I ca n't do A.A. , " Laura said . <p> " A lot of people do A.A. You get a lot of support with A.A. " <p> She put her hand on his knee . <p> " Vinnie , " she said . " I 'm not the type . " <p> But Vincent persisted , and Laura did finally attend an A.A. meeting . But it was not a success . She walked out of the meeting . <p> " Oh I had to leave , " she said , very self-possessed ; " I could n't stay there . " She was drunk but she was in control . " It was not the place for me , not at all , not at all . " She sat on the edge of her chair , pulling off her wool gloves , finger by finger . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't take it . Very preachy . It was not for me . " She threaded her hair behind her ears and looked up at him not quite defiantly . Her face was blotched and grimy , her fingernails rimmed with dirt ; he could see bruises on her forearm where she must have fallen . Yet somehow , seated there , one arm thrown over the back of the chair , and with her hair pulled up , she looked good . It was a mystery to Vincent how she did it . <p> " So now what are you going to do ? " <p> " Do ? What do I look like I 'm going to do ? I 'm not going to do anything . I 'm going to sit here and not do anything . " She slid further down into the chair and said , " You know what , Vincent ? " <p> " What ? " <p> " I really mean that . I decided . I 'm not going to do anything . " " You have to . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I decided I do n't have to . " She took his hand . " You have to do something , " said Vincent . <p> " I do n't want to talk about it , " said Laura . <p> Vincent never could remember who told him about St. Julia 's . It was connected to the city hospital in town , not very far from their apartment . Paul knew someone who went through St. Julia 's and came out dry though he could not remember his name . A client of theirs had an aunt who worked there . Between the two of them , Vincent and Paul persuaded Laura to go . " It 's only for a few days , " said Vincent , and Laura , exhausted from her most recent drinking bout , finally agreed . <p> Vincent borrowed Paul 's car . He had arranged to pick Laura up in the afternoon , and she was ready for him . She had taken a shower , washed her hair , put on clean clothes . Now she sat on a stool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Why am I doing this ? " she asked , eyes fixed on the pale winter sky . " We went through all that . " " Maybe I wo n't go , " said Laura . <p> Vincent took a deep breath and expelled it silently . " It 's up to you , " he said . <p> Laura 's cheekbones and forehead , half-concealed under the spill of her hair , were a raw , liverish color . She looked as if someone had slapped her repeatedly on the sides of her face and on her forehead . <p> " The car , " persisted Vincent . " I 'm double-parked . " <p> She slid off the stool and stood up . She wore pants , a shirt , heavy sweater , and sneakers . Her hair was freshly washed , straight , glossy , with reddish lights . " OK , OK , " she said . She had a bag with her , not much bigger than a pocketbook , which Vincent considered thoughtfully . Would she go so far as to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , she snapped open the bag and pulled out several books and a magazine and held them out to him , her face expressionless . Ashamed and sighing heavily , he took her arm and led her to the car . It was well into the rush hour when they left and that delayed them . They did n't get to the hospital until after six . <p> The detox center shared an entrance with the emergency room . Patients were shunted around the corner from the general entrance hall into a small waiting chamber of their own , which from Vincent 's point of view was unpromising . The linoleum on the floor was ripped here and there revealing blackened patches of cement , the ancient wooden benches were carved and dented , and the windows high on the wall were all but obliterated by heavy metal screening . Over all hung the heavy smell of disinfectant . <p> The desk clerk told them that St. Julia 's was not here as they had thought , in the center of the city and near to where they lived , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suburbs . Vincent was pleased . " There 's more room out there , " he told her . " You can take walks . " He pictured St. Julia 's : peaceful and serene , with rows of immaculately made beds , fresh-faced nurses to tend the patients , windows wide open to let in the good suburban air . But Laura was unhappy ; she did n't like being so far from home , she said . She did n't want to go way out to Godknows-where . She was n't going to sign . " I want to go home now , " she said to Vincent . But then all of a sudden she changed her mind , bent clown and signed the papers , then walked very fast over to the nearest bench , Vincent behind her . <p> A few people sat around the room , some of them with parcels or suitcases . The man on the next bench seemed unremarkable ; his hair was neatly combed and he had missed no more than a day 's shaving . He wore a suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirty . But now he put his hands over his face and began to sigh , sigh after sigh , and the sighs turned rapidly into sobs . Vincent glanced sideways at Lain-a ; she looked as if she might be going to cry , too , and he tried unsuccessfully to think of something heartening to say to her . Another patient came into the room , a woman : her face was calm and thoughtful . There was some dark smear around her eyes  --  eye makeup , Vincent thought . She was younger than Laura , tall and thin ; why was she here ? he wondered . <p> Finally a man came in wearing a baseball cap . Vincent thought he was another patient at first , but he turned out to be the driver of the bus to St. Julia 's . He ushered them out to the parking lot . Laura went through the door ahead of the others , stumbling a little but walking very fast all the same , the driver following , then the rest of them , the man still sighing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to Vincent at the last as he stood there staring after Laura . " Do n't worry , man , " she said . " She wo n't be there long . " She seemed detached , gloomy , but not angry , and certainly not drunk . What was she doing in detox ? Vincent wondered . " My trouble is I 'm too softhearted , " he said , but nobody was listening ; he sat all alone in the waiting room . He shook his head as he ambled out to the parking lot , hurrying to catch a glimpse of Laura before the bus drove off . He thought he saw it on the far side of the parking lot and ran over , but by the time he got there , it was gone . <p> When he returned the car to Paul , Vincent told him about the waiting room . It was not what he had expected , he said . Then he described St. Julia 's . " If they just get her on the right road  --  , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul said . <p> " I know that , " said Vincent . <p> " You have to be realistic , Vinnie , " said Paul . And Vincent agreed . <p> But when Vincent got home from work late the next day , he found Laura sitting on the steps by his door . She had lost her keys , either that or she was too drunk to use them . They went in and sat at the kitchen table facing each other . She was as bad as he had ever seen her , he thought . <p> " I do n't care for you , Vincent , " she said . " I do n't think I ever did care for you . " <p> She was high , freaky . <p> " They did n't give you anything to drink at the hospital ? " he queried . <p> " They gave me Valium , " she said . " I do n't know what else they gave me . " <p> " You were supposed to stay there five days , " he said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " So I checked myself out . " <p> " You do n't look too good , " he said heavily . <p> " Those places are voluntary ; did you know that ? " she asked , combing her hair with her fingers . " I bet you did n't know that , did you , Vin ? " She kept licking her lips , over and over , blowing them in and then out , then licking them over again . " You thought I 'd have to stay there ; you liked that , locking me up so I could n't go anywhere . " <p> " I thought they 'd help you , " he said . <p> " They could n't help anybody , Vincent . " <p> " You wanted to go , " he said . " You wanted help . " <p> " You saw those people . You saw that room . " <p> " It was n't that bad , " said Vincent , lying . <p> " Do you know what those people are ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he usually avoided around Laura . <p> " They are beyond redemption , " said Laura . " Do you hear me , Vincent ? " she said imperiously . " Those people are beyond redemption . " <p> " The woman did n't even look drunk . " <p> " She  --  she was the worst ... she was the very worst , " she said , with something like indignation . " She was a deformed soul . " <p> " What a terrible thing to say , " said Vincent . " What makes you say things like that ? " <p> She closed her eyes and leaned her head back against the chair . " You should n't have put me through that , Vinnie , " she said , eyes still closed . " You should n't have done that to me . " <p> He poured out some coffee , filling the mug halfway and placing it carefully in her hands . She drank it slowly and cautiously , pausing after each swallow . When she finished , she coughed until her eyes streamed but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Laura argued that evening , and they argued the next morning , too . <p> " So St. Julia 's did n't work out , " Vincent said finally . " So we 'll find another place . " <p> " No , " she said . <p> " There are plenty of places , " he said . <p> " I 'm not going . " <p> " You 're in tough shape , Laura , " said Vincent . " You look terrible . " <p> " Do n't tell me how I look , " said Laura . " I know how I look . " <p> At one point Vincent was so upset he grabbed her by her bony shoulders and shook her . It was like shaking a rag doll . He set her back on the chair , and she sat there for a while , head bowed , breathing through her mouth . <p> But suddenly she stood up . " I 'm leaving , " she said . She went out the door of the apartment and down the steps to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scarf as she went . Vincent followed her with some idea of dissuading her ; he even caught her arm but , turning and twisting furiously , she pulled it away . Finally she stood at the bottom of the hall . There was not much light , only what came through the glass panes in the front door , but her face stood out in the dimness , and she turned on him such a look of cold antagonism and fury that he stumbled and gasped . " Oh Christ , " he said , and he let her go . She ran on , but he stopped at the threshold . But anyway , he had to go to work . He had to earn a living , he figured . She 'd be back ; how long could she last without a warm apartment and Paul to do the wine run ? <p> But Vincent was wrong . Laura came to the apartment the next afternoon when he was out and got her clothes , such as they were , her typewriter , her few possessions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told Paul . Paul said he was not surprised . <p> " What am I going to do ? " asked Vincent . <p> " Nothing , " said Paul . <p> " There 's nothing you can do . " " We can go look for her , " said Vincent . <p> " What for ? " said Paul . <p> " To help her , for God 's sake , " said Vincent . " To save her . " But Paul shook his head . <p> " You do n't seem to miss her much . I thought you were her pal . I thought you two were buddies . " <p> " I was , " said Paul . " We were . But she 's hard on buddies . " <p> " She said some bad things to me , " said Vincent . Tears came to his eyes . He did n't know whether it was because of the bad things she said , or if it was because she had left him . <p> " There was n't anything you could do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . I could have tried harder . She would have stayed if she 'd been happy . " <p> " Forget it . She did n't want to be happy . " <p> " Everybody wants to be happy , " said Vincent . <p> " That 's not true , " said Paul . " Some people do n't care about being happy . Happiness does n't interest them . " <p> Vincent thought about that . He was inclined to believe Paul . But he disagreed about Laura . She was interested in happiness , he thought . There were times when they had been happy together . When he thought about their life together , those periods of happiness stood out like mica chips shining in dark stones . <p> " Too many wine runs , " Paul said . <p> " You made some of those runs , " said Vincent . <p> " If I had n't made them , who would have ? " asked Paul . Vincent fell silent . At one point he had been jealous of Paul . Now he felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She could turn into a bag lady . " <p> " Oh Jesus , " said Vincent . Why had n't he given her more presents  --  sweaters , gloves ; all he had ever given her was an azalea and some spider plants . <p> " But anyway , " said Paul , " it 's her call . " <p> " What do you mean , her call ? " <p> " She wants to go ; you have to let her go . " <p> Paul was right ; Vincent knew he was right . He wanted to go look for her , but he stopped himself . There 'd be no point to it , he decided . He did n't want to give up on Laura , but he had to . <p> As for Laura , no one knew where she went . A friend of Laura 's saw her shopping at the Safeway late one night . Paul himself thought he saw her in the public library reading a magazine . Someone else told them she spent time in a bar off Portland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because Laura never drank in bars . <p> <p> By LOUISE CORBETT <p>
