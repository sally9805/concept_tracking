When President Lyndon Johnson described his vision of the Great Society in 1964 , he spoke of a civilization where " the city of man serves not only the needs of the body and the demands of commerce but the desire for beauty and the hunger for community . . . Where the demands of morality , and the needs of the spirit , can be realized in the life of the nation . " With these lofty words , he launched the most ambitious agenda of social and economic reform since the days of Franklin D. Roosevelt . <P> The New Deal , which bequeathed to us what we know as modern liberalism , was patched together in a time of economic crisis , impelled by desperation . By contrast , Johnson 's vision was buoyed by a time of prosperity , fueled by a national mood of expansiveness . If America 's capacity for self-improvement was not inexhaustible , our faith in that capacity surely was . That November , Johnson defeated Barry Goldwater by what was then the largest popular majority in U.S. history . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depression that emboldened F.D.R. or the lift of economic expansion that energized L.B.J. Times are hard ; they are not desperate . But it is the long shadow and the troubled legacy of the Great Society  --  not its policy failures so much as its political failure  --  that Clinton must overcome . While he assumes the presidency with a detailed plan for domestic change , his vision will have to be implemented on the cheap : not a Great Society but , if his luck holds , a Pretty Good Society . <P> The early days of the Great Society witnessed a host of legislative initiatives . There was Medicare for the elderly ; Medicaid for the indigent ; Head Start for preschoolers . There was the Elementary and Secondary Education Act . The Job Corps . The Model Cities program . Of greater political significance were the promulgation and enforcement of sweeping civil rights measures , such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 . Through five heady years , the Great Society seemed to embody the full and resplendent maturity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a bright new day . In the ensuing decades , it came to look a lot more like liberalism 's super-nova : a final , white-hot burst before its dark collapse . <P> As with the New Deal , some of the programs were poorly conceived and ineffectual . Others are now taken for granted as a part of the political biosphere , programs whose worth neither party would dare contest . But it was the overarching scheme , and dream , that fell into disfavor . Reform was no longer experienced as something performed for the people but as something performed on the people . In an age of belated racial redress , white America  --  the rank and file , the lower-middle class  --  felt itself under siege . With jolting suddenness , the old alliance fell apart . Liberalism was coded as the elevation of black grievances over white ones , the welfare of layabouts over that of workers . <P> The irony was that liberalism , which sought to heal the injuries of class , should itself fall victim to class warfare  --  to the resentment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw as the professional- class purveyors of paternalism . White Southerners and Northern ethnics , once Democratic stalwarts , increasingly felt like outsiders at the gate . A Great Society ? Not if you 'd been left off the invitation list .
