GUILLAUME VOILA ! THE OMELET KING runs an aged yellow light , his tires squealing from the sharp turn he has put them through . His assistant Paolo yells from the passenger 's seat for him to be careful . <p> " We 're late ! " barks Guillaume . In his ten years since becoming an American caterer-at the advice of the Madonna herself , whose vision he witnessed in an omelet he was mixing while still an orphan in Dijon-he has never been late . But just this morning , as he was dicing a little egg salad for himself , she came to him again , this time in tears . Weeping for him , he assumes , because he is going to die . <p> After waiting impatiently for the gate of this ticky-tacky suburban community to open , Guillaume finds the correct two-story white frame house , parks in its driveway , and leaps toward the kitchen door . He stops before knocking , though , because he hears the raised voices of a man and woman from inside . <p> " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says the man 's voice . <p> " Of mine ? " The woman sounds tearful . " Do n't you think of him as your son , too ? " <p> " Of course , of course . It 's just-Why ca n't he be a little more like his sister ? " <p> " I do n't know , Garrett , " she says . " Why ca n't you be more like me ? " <p> Guillaume pauses , must catch his breath . In the long silence that follows , he is again a child on the " jour des visiteurs , " when occasionally one of his more cherubic playmates would catch the eye of some desperate couple from Paris , and the family constellation of the orphanage would shift once again , though Guillaume himself would never be plucked from it because he was not purebred French . <p> Standing behind him , Paolo whispers , " truffles in paradise , " an old catering joke . Guillaume returns to the van for a moment to compose himself . <p> Veiled she is , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of the stairs when she trips forward into his arms , laughing . <p> " I knew you 'd be there , " she says , wellspring of faith , patting his jaw . <p> " Be careful with that . " He means her wedding dress , a red tent-like affair with matching face curtain . Garrett wishes Lynn would take it off before she hurts herself , but she is determined to work on her purdah skills . To everyone 's amazement , she has devoutly adopted her natural father 's religion and-the real shocker-insisted he arrange a marriage for her . <p> She does n't want to date or even to flirt with any of the boys she meets in college . To her mother 's distress , Lynn thoroughly rejects the idea of an American-style courtship and marriage , and , implicit in those , the risk of an American-style divorce . As a result , her natural father and his wife have flown in from India last night , along with Lynn 's future in-laws and husband-to-be , a 22-year-old mechanical engineer named Hafiz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to arrive the day before-but their original flight was canceled-and so they 're due at the house any minute . <p> " Can you see at all through that thing ? " Garrett wonders . <p> " Oh sure , " she says . " A little . " She smells of sandalwood and cool clean skin , breath sweet as parsley , and Garrett feels downright mournful about losing her to holy matrimony on this stunning fall day . <p> He sees Lynn to her bedroom and waits in the doorway until she is safely seated inside . And then , against his better judgment , he decides to check on the other child , Turpin . Smoke seeps from under the boy 's door , which virtually throbs with angry bumper stickers , and instead of knocking , Garrett pushes his way in to find his step-son sitting amid a hot blue haze . <p> " I thought I told you not to smoke in this house , " says Garrett , wishing suddenly that he left the door closed , but he 's committed now to this bust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's something strange about his tux ; he 's cut a fist-sized hole over each knee . Garrett 's mouth hangs open , and he points to the boy 's exposed legs . " Have you been doping up ? " <p> " Doping up ? " <p> The smoke seems to be from legitimate pipe tobacco , a rich blend that Turpin claims his real father-the Norwegian explorer Tor Skaarhaug-used to smoke . " You 're on something , " Garrett insists nonetheless , " I know it . " <p> " I 'm high on marriage , dude . " <p> " Turpin , " says Garrett , slumping against the door jamb . He wishes that he were giving away Turpin 's hand in marriage today . " Why must you always be so selfish ? " <p> The boy looks at him mutely , unable or unwilling to register the question , and counters , " You do n't know anything . " <p> Garrett 's wife May-Annlouise always says he has to love the boy before the boy will love him . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while he did love the boy , but something ran afoul when Turpin hit puberty . Stealing that car did n't help his case any either . And now Garrett is left questioning the strict covenant of parenthood : perhaps there 's some loophole since , after all , the boy has changed-mutated , even-in any event has outgrown Garrett 's love . Or maybe the recent felony charge opens some doors . ... <p> A chime from the kitchen entrance . " I sure hope that 's the omelet guy , " mutters Garrett , glancing at his watch . He welcomes the opportunity to divert his anxiety toward the caterer . Guillaume Voila ! the Omelet King , wizard , famous for his amazing combinations-braised morels with shallots and creme fraiche , for instance-who promised he would even whip up a few Mughlai dishes for the occasion ; can he really be as good as everybody says he is ? <p> From a crack in his sister 's bedroom doorway , Turpin watches her pray and is alarmed to notice sweat on his hands and a slight stir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her-bowed before her dresser , eyes closed , her hair covered by mysterious cloth-generates a surge of longing in him . And he wonders for the first time if his objection to her marriage boils down to jealousy . She is technically his half-sister ; does n't this free the other half of Turpin to desire her ? <p> What a waste , he thinks , that she 's promised herself to a stranger . Someone with no knowledge or appreciation of her . Someone who ca n't begin to guess what 's written in her diary , or which stuffed animal has slept each night of the past ten years between her knees . ( It 's the green koala , Mr. Hans Binky Anderson , recently renamed Shah Jahan . ) <p> To calm himself , he touches the Percodan in his pocket . Normally by this time of day he 'd already be looped , but he 's waited because he needs a straight head to confront her . He clears his throat . Startled , she lowers her veil over her face and turns toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've talked and talked . " It 's scary how she sometimes anticipates his thoughts , and he wonders if , under the veil , her other senses have become heightened . He feels the air tickle his knees ; he cut the holes as a protest , and she probably ca n't even see them clearly . How inept of him . <p> He takes a step into her room and says , " You 're going to ruin your life . " <p> " I 'm going to ruin my life ? Look who 's talking , Mr. Pharmacist . " She has been handed a topic of some proportion . " And what about Mom ? " she continues . " Garrett 's her third husband . Picky picky picky ! Not to mention just a little bit ego-centered , do n't you think ? Those that deny Our revelations We will burn in fire . No sooner will their skins be consumed than We shall give them other skins , so that they may truly taste the scourge . " ' <p> " What are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Marry , divorce , remarry , divorce , remarry .... Does n't that sound hellish enough ? Why not spare myself ? And my kids ! " she cries . " Do n't tell me you 're not pissed at her , Turp . " <p> " Well , sometimes I guess , " he says , staring at his rented shoes . " But that 's why we have to stick together , you and me . " <p> She turns away from him . " The way I see it , I 'm doing God 's will . It is not for true believers to take their choice in their affairs if God and His apostle decree otherwise . " ' <p> She says God and His apostle with such fulfillment , Turpin indeed feels singed with jealousy . A poor debater in any case , he is not prepared to argue theology , feeling that he must prove not only his point but his very self , a prospect he finds terrifying and impossibly difficult . " Why do you parrot that book all the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighs , lifting her veil and looking at him sadly . She gentles him out of the room with a cool afterthought of a kiss . " Do n't be an infidel . " <p> The willowy dill he is chopping reminds Guillaume of the soft underarm hairs of his fiancee , the lovely Sarah Hsu , an amorous investment banker of Jewish and Chinese descent whom he met on a gourmet tour of the Holy Land . Guillaume believes that he was born with an image of love etched on his heart , and that he has met over the years various people who matched this image to some degree or other - an alarming number of women and men , in fact-but on meeting Sarah , he recognized her so completely , so instantly , it was as though he had loved her his entire life . And now that he and his beloved wish to marry and have a family , he 's under one a blood test , which , to his horror , he has failed . <p> One ray of hope remains : the lab has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something called the Western Blot . Even the test name seems ominous , suggesting the ruin of civilization . The results are to be rushed to his doctor later in the day , and in his anxiety , Guillaume has instructed that a call be placed to him immediately at this wedding . He has n't breathed a word of his fear to anyone yet , not even his fiancee . <p> Now , as he chops dill weed beside Paolo , Guillaume thinks about having to call each of the men and women of his past to tell them that his love has possibly meant their death . He thinks of his schooling at the orphanage lycee and the fall of man from the garden , how it had been for the sin of sexual pleasure , as the nuns found it convenient to imply , and he is filled with shame . He disputes his entire life , ruled as it has been by appetites . <p> " Ah , Dieu ! " Guillaume has nicked himself , and a drop of blood peeks out from his finger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the blood trickles toward his palm . He considers what to do . With his good hand he picks up the chopping board-the sprig of dill weed on it as well as the knife-and carefully slides it all into the garbage can . <p> " What are you doing ? " says Paolo . " That 's a $200 knife . " <p> " It 's a terrible knife , " Guillaume mutters . <p> " Just wash it off , " says Paolo . <p> " Leave it be ! " hisses Guillaume . <p> In the bathroom , he washes away the blood with scalding water and fumbles with a box of bandages . When he closes the medicine cabinet , he sees his fiancee 's face in the mirror . How will he tell his beloved Sarah ? He will come home from today 's wedding and shrug off his yolk-stained jacket and trousers and walk toward her slowly . Because she 'll have been puttering around the apartment , she 'll be wearing her glasses , a very expensive pair that were purchased , he suspects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have the delightfully unintended effect of turning her into a convent schoolgirl . He will slide them gently off her face , easing Sarah into her myopic trust of him , and he 'll carry her into their bedroom and undress her and enfold her in his arms and tell her that she should have herself tested and that now they will not be able to have the children , the many , many children , they wanted . <p> Standing behind her daughter , May-Annlouise brushes Lynn 's rich brown hair , letting it cascade over the wall of the wedding dress , and savoring these last few moments before she will tell the girl that her birth father , Parni , and his wife are waiting downstairs-and that they 've brought a surprise with them , a baby . A baby that Lynn knows nothing about . <p> " Mom , " she says , breaking the silence . " You do n't think I 'm making a mistake , do you ? " <p> May-Annlouise stops her brushing in mid stroke . It 's not like Lynn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these recent Islamic-fundamentalist years , and the question , so wide open in its plea for reassurance , seems to May-Annlouise like some sort of trap . " Of course you 're making a mistake ! " she wants to say , has tried to say in a thousand different ways . But she holds back , because the Lynn of today has her own very firm ideas and will only resent her . What Lynn really wants now , her mother believes , is consent . <p> " You 're doing what 's best for you , " says May-Annlouise , adding this fine print : " You would know if you were n't . " She ca n't get enough of her daughter 's hair . It feels so luxurious , and May-Annlouise realizes that she may be brushing it for the last time . <p> A few minutes later , in response to the burst of crying from downstairs , Lynn asks , " What 's that ? " <p> " A baby , " admits May-Annlouise . <p> " Duh . " <p> Unable to stall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nazar are downstairs already . " <p> Lynn jumps out of her chair and looks at May-Annlouise in frank disbelief . " They have a baby ? I did n't think they could have a baby . " <p> " Well , amazingly they did , " says May-Annlouise and , understanding that more is required of her , adds , " they went to a fertility doctor . " Lynn knows something of fertility doctors from May-Annlouise 's own fruitless experience three years ago . Well , not completely fruitless , after all , because she donated some of her surplus eggs to Parni and Nazar . <p> Her daughter slowly circles her , like a prowling cat . MayAnnlouise is unsure how the girl might take this last part of the story . When she originally sent the eggs abroad , MayAnnlouise believed she was doing the right thing , even a virtuous thing . But she wonders now . Perhaps the baby will supplant Lynn in her birth father 's heart . Perhaps Lynn will be jealous . <p> " So Papa and Nazar have a test-tube baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They were superstitious about it , " says May-Annlouise , offering up the truth . Parni in particular was afraid to provoke fate by gloating over their scientifically contrived miracle . " They made me promise not to tell . " <p> Her heart sinks . She has just now confessed that she ca n't keep a secret or a promise , and even worse , she is starting to wonder : what if she helped Parni and Nazar have a child of their own just so they would n't steal Lynn 's affections ? May-Annlouise 's biggest fear has always been losing the love of her daughter . <p> " So why did they let you in on it ? " the girl asks , pointing a henna-stained finger . Her eyebrows knot in that look of puzzled displeasure that May-Annlouise has seen so many times over the years . A look that says : I do n't know exactly what you 've done , but when I find out , I 'll never forgive you . <p> May-Annlouise has painted herself into a corner , though in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby , who , in a way , is Lynn repeated . They share the same almond eyes and just above the right lip a beauty spot that each girl clearly inherited from MayAnnlouise . Seeing the baby moments ago herself gave MayAnnlouise a chill of pleasure and sadness , because she remembered all the years of Lynn 's life gone by , and she wished she could have them again . She knows so much more now than she did when Lynn was born , could be so much better a mother . <p> Slowly now , May-Annlouise divulges that this baby is actually Lynn 's full sister . " When you go look at her , see your infant self . Her future is so open .... What joys would you wish for her ? " <p> The rest of this message remains implicit , unspoken : How can you marry that boy unless you 've chosen him ? How can you choose not to choose ? Do n't be afraid to choose ! Instead , May-Annlouise begs Lynn not to say anything about the eggs . The girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You 're amazing . " May-Annlouise blushes and shakes her head . <p> " I mean it , Mom , you are . It is God who splits the seed and the fruit-stone . Such is the bounty of God . ' But you helped . " She continues to stare at her mother reappraisingly and concludes , " That was a saintly act . I 've been living with a saint . " Her daughter kisses her on the corner of the mouth , at such an angle that their two beauty marks are almost in alignment . She then turns to go see her visitors - her birth father , his wife , and their test-tube baby-and disappears . <p> If May-Annlouise really were a saint , she 'd be willing to risk her daughter 's love to ensure her daughter 's happiness . She would try to prevent the wedding , yes ? To be a saint , May-Annlouise suspects , is to suffer an intense loneliness in one 's daily life that she knows she is not cut out for . His cheek still smarting from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his room and downs the Percodan that has been burning a hole in his pocket , in addition to another from his sock drawer . <p> As the warm , cottony fog spreads along his limbs , he looks out his window and sees the Omelet King 's van in the driveway . Suddenly he wants to help in some way . This impulse is unlike him , but his family has worn him out with their disapproval . He needs to set himself a task that will buy some acceptance . Desperate now to help , Turpin lurches down the stairs and outside . He stands before the white van and briefly considers its painted slogan-You 'vE GOT TO BREAK A FEW EGGS-before looking inside . With disappointment , he notes that the equipment has already been unloaded . <p> The refrigerator compartment , however , a huge vault with glass double doors , holds more eggs than he 's ever seen-a stack three-feet high . There 's something formidable about them , something a little scary , like a late-show science experiment . He has to touch one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the chilly hoard of eggs . He runs his fingers across their skinny oval tips . He supposes that he should carry some into the kitchen , but he ca n't bring himself to do so , and lingers there remembering the day he first met his stepfather . It was sometime near Easter , the precise equinox , in fact , and Garrett delighted the family by standing an egg on its head and leaving it somehow to balance on its own . For months afterward , Turpin would sneak into the kitchen and try vainly to repeat that magic , his resentment growing in tandem with the conviction that Garrett had somehow tricked him . Tricked them all , only no one else could see it . <p> Instead , they all focus their distrust on Turpin , especially since the car episode , and he knows that one more foul-up will put him on eternal probation . He should just call it a day and bring in the lousy eggs . He can live with his sister 's bad marriage , ca n't he ? There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And God knows he ca n't have her himself . <p> Turpin thrusts his head downward . Crunch ! <p> The shells stick to him , dripping their jelly . He gags from the splattered yolk and slams his head down again and again , bursting still more of the fragile orbs , and again , until the entire top tier is broken and bleeding . Pounding his fists , he finds he can crack the second tier , which is protected by only a thin nest of cardboard . When the second tier is sufficiently smashed , he climbs atop the entire stack and lies down as though in his bed , and with his fists and forearms and knees and feet he flails , sobbing . Slowly the layers beneath him flatten , and even though he is clearly sinking , sinking , sinking , he feels lighter . <p> It is Garrett who discovers him . He pulls on the sleeve of Turpin 's tuxedo until the boy slides out of the refrigerator case on a river of slime . A thousand scratches on his face and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dad , " he says , blinking rapidly , disoriented . <p> " I do n't believe you . Not this , not even from you ! " Garrett sputters . " This mess ! " <p> The van looks as though it was targeted by an elite unit of ultra-vegan terrorists . And never has Garrett seen a tuxedo more violated . All his worst fears about his step-son are inflamed . He does n't even hear the word Dad , though it has never been spoken before by this boy to this man . <p> " Dad , " Turpin says again , brushing a flake of shell from his cheek . " Try to understand . I had to do it . " <p> " You had to ruin your sister 's wedding ? " <p> " Yes . I did it for her . " <p> Garrett stares at the vandalized vault and clasps his arms against his chest . " My God ! They should have thrown you in jail ! " he says . " You 're a menace ! " He swings the ham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back at the last moment , pounding the air instead . It 's unsatisfying to pound the air , he learns . <p> Coiled on top of the wheel well lies a long braid of jumbo garlic , which Garrett now hefts like a limp baseball bat . Taking aim at his step-son 's slippery head , he only vaguely registers the look on Turpin 's face : brow pursed , mouth buoyant . In the days and months from now when he will remember this look , Garrett will read into it a flickering pilot light of resolve , conviction even , and will regret what he is about to do . But just now , he ca n't help himself ; seeing only a teenager 's mocking smirk , he steps into his swing , shifting his weight forward , whipping the garlic around , when something snags the braid from behind until it breaks apart , feathery bulbs scattering like startled doves . Garrett turns to find the French caterer holding on to the braid 's tail , and Turpin takes advantage of this reprieve to run for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explains . <p> " But look at this ! " pleads Garrett , pointing toward the van . " What a disaster ! " How can he love this boy first ? This unlovable boy . It would be wrong to love him . It would be like loving evil . " That boy is , " he says , trying it out loud , " evil . " <p> Guillaume climbs into the van to survey the damage . He presses his thumb and forefinger against the band of his toque . " This will be a bitch to clean , " he concedes . " I applaud your commitment to hire disadvantaged youth , but I could have referred you to more reliable help . " <p> Garrett laughs bitterly . If only it were so simple . " No , no . He 's my step-son . His father died when he was five . " " Then how can you call him evil ? " the caterer asks , his eyes squinting in what may very well be reproach . " I have seen many bad boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be crying . " <p> Garrett does n't remember seeing Turpin cry just now . But maybe so , maybe so , though why that should matter Garrett remains uncertain . He becomes very still and tries to hear what 's going on inside the house . He 'd feel more sure of himself if his wife were also yelling at Turpin . He strains to pick up any little thing , a slammed door , a shout , but can only hear the hired pianist playing a scale . <p> " Go to him , " says Guillaume , his eyes moist slits . <p> " Hey , it 's OK , " Garrett tells him , setting down the mace of garlic and putting a consoling hand on the caterer 's shoulder . " We 'll get everything fixed and cleaned . We 'll replace all the eggs . " <p> " Go make up with him . " <p> Garrett sighs . " I 'm not that generous . I do n't have it in me . " <p> " First you do it , " says the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like eating . " <p> As Garrett peels from his hands lingering bits of garlic like old , dry skin , there comes a shout from above : " I 'll make you understand ! " <p> It 's Turpin 's voice , far away and weepy . He 's standing on the roof , cupping his hands around his mouth and shouting something about God . <p> " What did he just say ? " Garrett asks Guillaume . <p> " He says God demands a sacrifice . " All color seems to have left the caterer 's face . <p> " Do you need some water , Mr. Voila ! ? " <p> He shakes his head feebly . " I am expecting a phone call , " he murmurs and walks toward the kitchen entrance . <p> Garrett looks at the roof top . " Turpin , why are you up there ? " <p> " I 'll prove it ! " the boy 's voice echoes back . " I 'll prove it to you ! " <p> Garrett finds worrisome the combination of " prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " as it reminds him of crusades and suicidal philosophers . He has no idea why the boy is up on the roof but figures that someone needs to get him down before the afternoon becomes irreparable . " Hang on a second , Turp , I can barely hear you . " <p> Garrett jogs toward the house-not the full sprint that would signal to Turpin , and himself , that he 's afraid . He hops up the back stairs that lead to the attic 's spring-loaded ladder , then follows the slime trail across the dusty floorboards to the porthole window , its circumference coated with egg , already drying in the breeze . Reaching an arm up to the shingles , he tries to squeeze through enough to be able to step on the window 's ledge . After many contortions , he manages to drag himself up onto the roof . How will they ever get back down ? <p> He can see , on the pitch 's far side , the top of Turpin 's head-his hair , years ago so white and fine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splotchy color , like an abused set of watercolors . How did you come to this ? Garrett wonders . How did we let you ? Garrett scrapes his way up the thirty-degree slant , his shoes slipping from the albumen , and sits for a moment on the roof 's spine . The future in-laws have just now arrived and are congregating in the backyard with Parni , Nazar , and their baby . Everyone looks up at the roof . <p> " Mr. Garrett ! " Parni waves . " Come meet your new relations ! " <p> " Mr. Hyder , Mrs. Hyder ! " Garrett calls out to the in-laws . " Hafiz ! Welcome to Baltimore ! Hi , Nazar ! Parni , I hope May-Annlouise is getting you a gin and tonic ! " Immediately , Garrett regrets mentioning Parni 's favorite cocktail in front of the in-laws , who , for all he knows , observe the prohibition . <p> " Perhaps some tea , if you please , " says Parni , clasping his hands in front of him . " What brings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something ! Down in a minute ! " <p> Turpin stands at the edge , near the gutter , and stares across the backyard then slowly turns toward Garrett . " Do you know God 's will ? " <p> " Could we maybe discuss this after the wedding ? " <p> " No . " <p> Garrett sighs . " Since when did you start caring about God ? " <p> " Just cause I never talk about it with you does n't mean I do n't care . " <p> Garrett ca n't refute the logic of this ; still it stuns him to think of this disheveled punk contemplating a higher power . Himself , Garrett does not know whether to believe in God but has tried to lead his life as if God exists . This , however , he realizes is not the same as believing . " Your sister seems to believe in God . Have you spoken to her ? " <p> " That 's the whole point . My sister has got it all wrong , " says Turpin , moving a bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's so wrong , she 's going to marry some guy she does n't love . " <p> " Hey , keep your voice down . I 'm sure Hafiz is a very nice guy . Probably . " He waves tepidly to the wedding party below . " What are you proving by standing on the roof ? " <p> " No , " Turpin says slowly , as though talking to a child , " by jumping off the roof . It 's God 's will . He wants me to stop the wedding . " <p> " How do you know this ? " <p> " Because if He did n't want me to jump , He 'd have made you man enough to stop me . " <p> You little shit , thinks Garrett . Who in today 's world goes around measuring manhood ? And where does Turpin get off saying what 's enough ? The very idea of being judged incenses Garrett , let alone that he 's come up short . Still , he grudgingly admits , the boy earns a few points for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been completely fair to his step-son , and incidentally : how much manhood does this situation require exactly ? <p> " Turpin , " he says , inching his way down the slant , angling his weight toward true vertical , " I want us to bebetter . I know there 's more I could have done . Can we at least talk about it ? " He extends a hand toward the boy and looks him in the eye and means what he says . <p> " Too late ! " yells Turpin and slaps away Garrett 's hand . The boy 's knees buckle and he sends one foot into the gutter in search of his balance , his arms twirling jerkily like igniting propellers , and throughout this he 's looking right at his step-father as if to tell him : When all is said and done , I would prefer not to fall off this roof . In the single second during which all this has passed , Garrett has taken a step forward and now reaches toward the boy and grabs his hand . <p> No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turpin has seen it . This counts for something . This has to count for something , Garrett tells himself and will continue telling himself over a long convalescence . This has to count for something . <p> The phone rings , and Guillaume pounces on it before anyone else in the house can pick up . He prays that his test is negative and wonders , between prayers , what he would give up to have his wish and if this includes the love of his precious fiancee or perhaps even the very existence of God . <p> " Yes ? " he asks the phone . <p> " Guillaume Lehalleur , please , " the faraway voice of his physician demands . <p> Guillaume would not want to live in a world without either Sarah or God , but better to choose Sarah , better to live blissfully in a world with no meaning than in a meaningful world of pain . <p> " Yes ? " He stretches the tangled phone cord toward the kitchen sink . He fears he might need to throw up . " Guillaume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his doctor . <p> " A very lucky man . But , Guillaume , " he says , pausing , " as usual , your cholesterol is sky high . " <p> Guillaume swallows . As he looks out the kitchen window , he sees the blur of two bodies falling to earth . His inner eye observes the man gripping the boy , the strange boy , whose lips curl in an almost beatific smile that transforms his face into an object of belovedness . <p> Guillaume thanks the doctor and would thank the Virgin for pardoning his promiscuity , except he is beginning to suspect that his understanding of certain religious matters has been clouded and that , for example , Adam and Eve were banished from the garden not so much for their sexual pleasure , after all , but for having the arrogance to believe they 'd make good parents . <p> He rests the phone in its cradle , picks it up again . He wants to call Sarah , just to hear her breathe . He thinks about his cholesterol , and the cholesterol of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and decides to send Paolo to the market for artichokes instead of eggs . <p> I will become the Artichoke King , thinks Guillaume , his blood pounding in his hands , his chest . He is alive on this earth . Alive . And because he will be blessed with many , many children , surely his greatest sins lie ahead . <p>
