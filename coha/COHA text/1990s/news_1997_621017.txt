<p> The scandal involving a Discovery Bay cremains scatterer points to a larger problem , critics say  --  lax regulation of the funeral industry and price gouging of bereaved people . <p> Critics say problems have gotten worse since the late East Bay journalist Jessica Mitford chronicled funeral home malfeasance in her book " The American Way of Death " more than 30 years ago . <p> " It 's far worse now , " said Karen Leonard , chief researcher on Mitford 's final revision of the book , due out later this year . <p> " California is one of the only states that does n't allow survivors to scatter relatives ' ashes , " Leonard said . " We have to use middlemen who are not subject to any real regulation . It 's expensive , and there 's no guarantee the job will be done right  --  as we 've seen . " <p> Leonard was referring to the cremains of about 5,000 people found this month in a warehouse in eastern Contra Costa County . The cremains were evidently stored by Allan Vieira @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disperse the ashes . <p> Vieira is being sought on suspicion of grand theft and other crimes . Last week , attorneys representing 13 families filed a class- action suit in Sacramento Superior Court against Vieira for failing to scatter the ashes . <p> Although public attention has focused on scant government oversight of cremains disposers , Leonard says minimal consumer protection is the rule for the funeral business . <p> " One of the biggest problems is consolidation in the industry , " said Leonard , executive director of the nonprofit Redwood Funeral Society of Sonoma , which helps arrange cheap cremations and funeral services for members . " The big guys are gobbling up the little guys . . . . It 's getting increasingly difficult for consumers to find competitive pricing . <p> " The rock-bottom price , if you go through an established funeral home in California , is $ 1,000 , " Leonard said . " Prices for a burial and full service go up to $ 7,000 or more . No other country has a range from $ 700 to $ 1,400 . But Jerri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sebastopol , said most people end up paying around $ 2,000 . <p> " When they walk into the funeral home , they 're incredibly upset and vulnerable , " said Lyons , whose organization helps survivors handle arrangements for their deceased relatives . " They get a very effective sales job , and they end up shelling out a lot of money just to get the whole thing over with . " <p> Bill Vlcek , spokesman for the California Funeral Directors Association , which counts 80 percent of state funeral directors as members , disputed Leonard 's and Lyons ' contentions . <p> " The funeral industry is changing , like all businesses , " Vlcek said . " It 's a capital-intensive business , and there is some consolidation . But we 're subject to the same laws of supply and demand as everybody else . Funeral directors who are not competitive lose out . There are lots of independents who will quote competitive prices . But people have to do something they do n't like to do  --  think enough about their own death to look around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year , funeral practices in California were regulated by state funeral and cemetery boards . But consumer complaints of board directors ' coziness with industry lobbyists were so rife that the boards were dissolved in 1995 , and authority was transferred to the Department of Consumer Affairs . <p> Last year , Consumer Affairs substantiated allegations that Ray Giunta , executive officer of the cemetery board , had taken $ 10,200 from a cemetery manager and used cemetery trust funds for personal use . In addition , a board employee who worked under Giunta was accused of taking $ 3,840 from a cemetery that had been under board conservatorship . <p> Consumer Affairs is recovering money from Giunta and the unnamed employee and has referred the matter to the state Fair Political Practices Commission . No criminal charges have been filed . <p> Despite such investigations , Leonard charges that the Consumer Affairs Department is no more responsive than the old funeral boards were . <p> " They 'll smilingly tell you that they investigated 150 funeral homes , but then they wo n't provide you with their findings because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record , " she said . <p> Consumer Affairs spokesman Bob Brown said the department is proscribed by law from commenting on active inquiries . But completed probes have revealed significant wrongdoing . <p> On June 5 , the department announced that $ 55,000 in fines had been obtained as a settlement for criminal fraud and mismanagement charges against three Neptune Society franchises in Southern California . <p> Emanuel Weintraub , president and general manager of the three franchises , agreed to the fines and probation without admitting to the allegations . The charges included forging a physician 's signature on a death certificate , delivering the wrong cremated remains to a widow and mismanaging $ 12 million in funds received for contracted services . <p> Last year , Dean Dempsey , the manager of Sunnyside Cemetery in Long Beach , was sentenced to four years in state prison for embezzling $ 500,000 from the cemetery 's endowment care fund . <p> Also last year , the managers of a cemetery in Santa Fe Springs were charged by the Los Angeles County district attorney with digging up graves and reselling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fraction , pleaded no contest and face sentencing in August . Trial is pending for Victor Fortner , who is Alma Fraction 's son and Felicia Fraction 's brother . <p> Brown said his department is hampered in its oversight by tight budgets and staffing . <p> " There 's only so much we can do to micromanage private enterprises , " he said . " Basically , we have to receive complaints to act . " <p> The Department of Consumer Affairs licenses about 2.1 million Californians in more than 180 professions , including medicine , automobile repair , accounting and hair styling . About 100 staff members handle cemetery and funeral home complaints . <p> In fiscal 1995-96 , the department received 603 complaints about cemeteries and 384 complaints about funeral homes . Mediation resolved 121 of the cemetery complaints and 266 of the funeral home complaints . <p> The remaining cases resulted in reprimands , fines and referrals to local district attorneys for possible prosecution , or are the subject of investigations . The department secured $ 34,000 from cemeteries and funeral homes for refunds . <p> Brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I do n't want to broad-brush the entire industry , because many funeral directors are making good- faith efforts , " he said . " But there are some problems . Consumers are vulnerable , so they have to be educated . " <p> Lyons said the state should require funeral directors to provide consumer affairs brochures to potential clients before sales pitches . <p> " People do n't know , for example , that they can build their own caskets , obtain death certificates and disposition permits on their own , and transport bodies ( once they have proper certification ) , " Lyons said . <p> Leonard said a few states have enacted laws that allow survivors greater control over remains , most notably Colorado , Arkansas , Indiana and Michigan . <p> Both industry advocates and critics agree on one point : Strictures need to be tightened on cremains scatterers . The state now requires only minimal credentials  --  qualifying tests or licenses are not required . <p> Assemblyman Tom Torlakson , D-Antioch , wants to change that . " We 're thinking of a licensing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for remains disposal so ( ashes ) ca n't be stored , " he said . <p> Leonard is unimpressed . <p> " There was a case identical to this several years ago , when ashes were discovered at a site in the Sierra foothills , " she said . " All that came out of that was legislation that actually made it harder for consumers to take control of cremains . <p> " They need to repeal laws that prevent people from caring for their own dead , including scattering cremains and transporting bodies to mortuaries ( which is currently prohibited for private citizens ) , " Leonard said . " All current laws do are raise the price of death without providing consumer peace of mind or environmental safety . "
