Chapter OneNew York City 1994 You ca n't be happy in this life because of what happened in your past lives . What would you think if someone said that to you ? You 'd think , " It 's hopeless , why bother trying . " Right ? Or would you think , " The woman telling me this is crazy and I 'd better get me and all my worldly goods out of here ? " Or would you be like me and think , " A story ! Everyone 's into time travel now and nobody 's doing past lives , so maybe I can ask a lot of questions and make a story from this lady 's answers . " This last is what I thought when I first met Nora because I am a writer inside and out . There is n't one molecule of me that is n't geared toward , How can I use this in a story ? People are always asking me how I came to be a writer . I 'd like to have an answer that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was walking through a meadow full of tiny blue flowers when a beautiful woman in a silver dress appeared and bopped me on the head with her wand . She had a golden voice and said , " I am giving you the gift of writing . Go forth and write . " Sometimes I think that people want to hear that I was " chosen , " rather like a prophet . But you know , whenever you read about prophets , they always cry to God , " Oh Lord , why me ? " Sometimes I think being " chosen " is n't a gift , it 's a curse . At any rate , I have just told you why I became a writer . I make up stories about everything . Absolutely everything on earth . I see something , hear something , read something , and my mind starts creating a story . Storytelling is natural to me . When people ask me how I came to be a writer , what I want to ask in return is , What is in your head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while listening to a terminally boring speech ? While driving a car ? While putting the sixth load of wash in the machine ? To me , this is the real mystery of life . I already know what 's inside my head , but what is inside other people 's heads if not stories ? Well , anyway , now that I am a full-fledged writer ( that means I need no outside job to pay the bills ) I find that we writers have a little club that we 're all supposed to be loyal to . The Hippocratic oath is nothing compared to this . Since I do n't want to lose my writing membership , I 'll say what I 'm supposed to . It 's bloody hard work writing . What is that thing someone said about opening a vein and spilling your blood onto the paper ? Well , it 's true . Writing is really , really hard work . By golly , I bet I sit on my fanny six to ten hours a day . I pace the floor thinking about " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sends me flowers and money every time I turn in a book . Now , really , does it sound like a writer suffers more than , say , a secretary ? She has to be awakened by an alarm clock ( I wake when I want to ) , get the kids and hubby off , work for a boss who never praises her , then do another shift of work when she gets home . And no one ever says , " Wow , you 're a secretary . How did you get to be one ? " I guess we all do whatever we can . If you can drive a truck , you do that . If you can hassle people without conscience . you become a lawyer . If you have stories in your head you write them down . To me being a writer is n't any different and not nearly as important as most other professions . But it seems that the world does n't agree with me . The world at large has decided that writers are smarter , more astute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they treat them with awe and reverence . My opinion is that we should have a National Profession Lottery and every year about ten professions would be drawn from a hat , and for that year all the praise would go to the people in those professions . They should have best-seller lists , receive fan letters , have autographing parties , and have something like a publishing house to praise them and give them gifts . See ? There I go again with a story . Give me a keyboard and I ca n't stop . However , about these ten professions to be chosen , I want to make it clear that there is one " profession " that is too evil to be included in this lottery . Book reviewers . Specifically , romance book reviewers . Maybe I should tell you right now so , if you are offended , you can stop reading this book . I write romances . There , I 've said it . It 's out in the open . For all the joy of my life , there is one aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shockingly awful . And that is the way the world looks at romance novels , at romance readers , and , above all , at romance writers ! Is n't the world a weird place ? I saw a man on Oprah who was admitting that he 'd had sex with his daughter several times when she was a child . Nearly every actor/singer tells the world he/she has done every drug known and hurt or driven away most of the people in their lives . And how are all these people greeted ? With love , that 's how . With love and understanding and sympathy . But here I am and what do I do ? I write funny little romantic stories about men and women who fall in love with each other . The wildest thing they do is make a baby or two . No drugs . No incest . No one boiling anyone and doing heaven only knows what else to them . I do n't even have people plotting clever ways to kill someone . I just invent stories about what we all dream about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 'd think that the very thought of a romance writer would bring a smile to people 's lips . Ah , how nice . Love . Making love . Laughter . Kissing . But no , the world is upside down as far as I can see , and romances and their writers are ridiculed , hissed , and generally spat upon . And for what reasons ? One of my favorites is that women who read them might get mixed up about reality and imagine a man is going to rescue them from Life . According to this theory , women are so stupid that they ca n't tell a story from reality . Is anyone worried that the men who read spy thrillers are going to go after their neighbors with an automatic weapon ? No , I do n't remember anyone thinking that . Nor do I remember anyone worrying about murder mysteries or science fiction . It just seems to be dumb ol ' women who might think some gorgeous , thoughtful , giving hunk is going to rescue them . Honey , if any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , romance novels would n't be forty percent of the publishing industry . Anyway , back to the reviewers . These smart young people graduate from college with dreams of working on some magazine of intellectual merit , and what happens to them ? Some old man who no longer has stars in his eyes decides to teach the young whippersnapper a lesson about life so he gives this child the lowest job in all the industry : reviewing romance novels ! Guess who bears the brunt of the newly graduated person 's rage ? Eighty grand spent on education and they are given a book to read that has a nursing mother cover ( so called because of the size of the you-know-whats and the obviously about-to-be-lowered bodice Quiz : do you think a man or a woman invented these covers ? ) . Anyway , this person takes her/his rage out on me , the romance writer . The lowest creature on earth . A housewife with a bank account . Rule number one for reviewing a romance novel : compare the book to the best book you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jane Austen , then use about sixty grand of your education to cut this writer down in the nastiest way possible . If , however , you should make the error of liking the book , write that " Readers of Hayden Lane should like this one . " Whatever you do , do n't stick your neck out and actually say you liked the book . If you allow anyone to think you like romances , you 'll never get promoted to reviewing the " good " books . So , anyway , what does all this have to do with the subject of past lives ? It has everything to do with it because , you see , I 'm thirty-nine years old ; I 'm about to hit the big four-oh , and I 'm trying to figure out some things about my life . Sometimes I think I 'm as curious as my readers as to how I became a writer . What does make us what we are today ? All in all , the most interesting thing to analyze is people . Why does the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does someone have a fear of knives or fire or high places ? What about those people who are too afraid to leave their houses ? There is , of course , the theory that every fear in your adult life was caused by something awful that happened in your childhood , preferably something you do n't remember so that a therapist can see you hundreds of times and charge you thousands of dollars to help you remember this dreadful thing . So after therapy you 're poorer and have some more rotten memories as well . During a bad time in my life ( what can cause a woman a " bad time " except a man ? ) I went to a therapist . She told me that I had stories going through my head because I wanted to go to bed with my father . When I recovered my power of speech , I said in great indignation , " I did not want to go to bed with my father ! " " Oh , " she said calmly , " then you suppressed it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been important to me  --  I did n't return after that visit . But I have tried to figure out why I write and why I write what I do . You see , all writers want one thing . They want immortality . That 's why we 're so vain that we think someone else will want to read what we put down on paper . We writers hear of Mark Twain dying in poverty and feel no sympathy because ol ' Mark attained the goal . He will live forever . Our families would no doubt choose for us to be writers who make lots of money , but we writers would take eternal recognition over wealth every time . But that 's the problem . No one comes to you , sitting on a pink cloud , a clipboard in hand , and says , " We 're giving you the gift of writing . Do you want the kind that everyone sneers at or the kind that people remember after you 're dead ? " Talent is not like a used car . You ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ca n't say , " I 'd like to trade in my talent for an Edith Wharton model . " My talent happens to be in writing romantic novels , and they get laughed at and ridiculed . In any movie , if the director wants to show that a female character is stupid , he puts a romance novel into her hands . Early on , I decided that I was grateful for any talent at all . Those who can , do , and those who ca n't , review . As Anthony Trollope said , " Only a blockhead writes for anything except money . " Or thereabouts . Anyway , it 's true . You ca n't very well sit down at your computer and say , " I 'm now going to write my way into history . " It does n't work that way . You do n't decide what lives on after you , other people do . So , anyway , I still wonder how I came to write romantic novels and I look back at my life to see if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , I 'd like to know what made me like I am in every aspect . Until I was seven years old , I was the happiest child on the planet . My parents and sister and I lived next door to two houses filled with cousins and aunts and uncles and a couple of sets of grandparents . It was heaven . I was the ringleader of the bunch , ordering everyone about , telling them what to do and how to do it . My creativity was truly appreciated . Well , maybe not appreciated by everyone . There was the time I saw my grandmother twist the head off a chicken , so I told my cousin we ought to help Nana and twist the heads off all the chickens . There we were , no more than five years old , chickens tucked between our scraped knees and twisting and twisting and twisting . My grandmother came out of the house with a load of wash and there were all her chickens , their heads cocked to one side , listing drunkenly about the yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temper of my grandmother , I do n't know how my cousin and I escaped alive . But those wonderful years ended soon enough when my mother decided she 'd had enough of her mother-in-law 's renowned temper . My mother ( who could defeat any temper with her rock-hard stubbornness ) on one fateful day informed my father that she had bought a piece of land and he was going to build her a house on it . In my parents ' household we all liked to pretend that my father was the one who made the rules . I think the rule he made was , Give Mama what she wants or she 'll make life hell for all of us . Whatever his thoughts , he was n't fool enough to say no to my mother when she had that look in her eye . Whatever the philosophy behind it , the result was the same : We moved . In that one day I lost all those cousins and grandparents ; I lost the chickens and the cows and the possum that lived in a barrel in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiggers and I lost apple trees to climb . In one day I went from being the champion of all , a person of prime importance , to being the **27;0;TOOLONG . In a matter of hours I went from having the most exciting life in the world to having a life of supreme dullness . My mother and sister were cut out of the same cloth . They were good . Good , good , good . What is more boring than good ? My mother was always saying , " Do n't eat too much chocolate . It 'll make you sick ! ' or " I ca n't look at that right now . I have too much work to do " or " Hayden , you can not read that book now . You have n't finished cleaning the bathroom . " On and on she went . There was a right time and a wrong time for everything . But as far as I could tell the right time for exuberance never came . Did n't people ever want to do something that was n't on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world who actually wanted to eat as much chocolate as I could hold and damn the consequences ? Looking back , I think that some people are afraid to break out of the rules . Maybe they 're afraid that if they break the rules , they 'll lose all self-control and become something horrible  --  in my mother 's case that would be a woman with a dirty bathroom floor . Whatever was behind it all , again the result was the same : I was put in a bubble of isolation and left there alone . I had to try to remember to sit up straight , walk sedately , and never , never be rambunctious . I tried , but it 's difficult to control yourself when you 're a child . I guess an awful lot of me slipped out because I heard the phrase " You know how you are " a few million times . Sometimes I got the feeling that my parents thought that if they did n't keep me under rigid control every minute of every day that I 'd lose it altogether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just plain never stop . Maybe they feared not being able to reel me back in if they just let me go ahead and be myself . Now that I 'm an adult and know all about adult things ( uh-huh , sure ) I know that my parents were not creative and I was . If they bought something that needed assembly , they read the box and put it together in the way the manufacturer wanted them to . If I bought something , I felt that reading the instructions was cheating . And if I could n't put it together easily , it was quite ordinary for me to jump up and down on the box and say all the dirty words I knew  --  which , thankfully , were n't many . My punishment for box jumping or any infraction of the peace rules was to be talked to " for my own good . " Never in my life have I understood that phrase . When someone says this is " for your own good " it always , always , always means that someone is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . So , anyway , how did I survive these spirit killers ? How did I survive being dragged to the preacher so he could talk to me because I was " different " ? How did I survive hearing my mother ask my relatives if they had any idea what she could " do " with me ? I did the best I could by escaping into a land of stories . I read incessantly . When my mother made me vacuum the bedroom I shared with my sister , she was more concerned with the length of time I spent vacuuming than with how clean the floor was after I was finished . All she ever checked was to see that the light bulbs were spotless , so I learned to clean the bulbs , then I 'd get in the closet with a book , a flashlight , and the vacuum and sit down for a forty-five-minute read . Since my mother had the ears of a bat , I had to make sure the suction was going on and off , so I sat there putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reading , sucking and reading . I did learn that one must make sure the hose end is clean or one 's face gets awfully dirty , then one 's mother makes one actually clean the room . Gag ! So , anyway , I learned to get round the work , work , work , clean , clean , clean ethic of my mother 's house and make time for the books I loved so much . I read nonfiction even then . I read about heroes , about men and women who had done things and accomplished things in their lives . There was Daniel Boone and Jackie Cochran and , oh sigh , Captain Sir Richard Francis Burton . There was the most magnificent queen who ever lived , Elizabeth I , and there were girls who dressed as boys and became spies . Oh , but the list was endless . I did n't realize it then but what I was doing was researching . Yes , that 's right , researching . Now I receive reader letters saying in awe , How do you ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Okay , let 's have a reality check here . This woman has written me that she has a full-time job and three children under the age of five and she wants to know how I research a romantic novel . I want to ask her how she survives each day . I guess I 'm explaining so much about my life to make you , my readers , think I 'm a normal , sane person because something happened to me that is n't normal and maybe not even sane . You see , I fell in love with one of my fictional characters . Up until I started writing a book titled Forever , I liked to think I was a perfectly well-adjusted person . Maybe I did have a lot of stories running through my head , but to me , the people who do n't have these stories are missing something . Anyway , I like to think I was happy and relatively well adjusted . I was thirty-seven years old , had a great career , had friends , and best of all , I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream come true : smart , funny , talented , caring . If I 'd made him up he could n't have been better . And he adored me . He laughed at all my jokes , thought I was beautiful , smart . You name it , everything was perfect between us . There was no question that finally , at last , I wanted to get married . When he asked me to marry him , while riding in a hansom cab through Central Park , I threw my arms around his neck and said , " Yes , yes , yes ! " with such enthusiasm that I embarrassed Steve . But that night , actually , early Sunday morning , I awoke at 3 A.M. with an IDEA . That 's unusual for me . When I first started to write I was plagued with Ideas , and I was so afraid that I 'd forget them when I awoke that I got out of bed and wrote all night . But after I 'd written about ten books , I 'd wake up with an Idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my marriage proposal , with my left hand weighted down by Steven 's ring , I had an IDEA . It was so big that I could n't relax against Steve 's warm body and go back to sleep . So , tiptoeing , I got out of bed and went to my computer to write down my thoughts . What I was really thinking about was n't so much a story but a character . Well , okay , a man . A wonderful man , a man unlike any I 'd ever written about before . A man who was more real to me than any other man I 'd created . In my books , I write about one family , the Tavistocks . When I first started writing , every time I finished a book I 'd get depressed because I knew that I 'd never again see the characters in my book . So one day I had the brilliant idea of writing four books about four brothers in one family . However , I had not taken into consideration that when I finished the series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , the only way I could figure how to recover was to write more books about the same family . At the time I did n't realize what I was getting into . As the number of books about this family increased , the mail brought me thousands of requests for family trees . And people kept pointing out that I 'd have a man and woman with a little boy in one book and in the next book their child would be a girl . I had to buy professional genealogy software to keep up with all of my people , since within a few years I had over four hundred characters , all related to one another . Over the years I had come to love my Tavistocks and their cousins , and they had become very real to me . So on the night of my engagement it was n't unusual for me to start writing about a man named Tavistock . I named him James Tavistock , to be called Jamie , and he was a great big gorgeous sixteenth-century Scotsman running around in the Tavistock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today who travels back in time to meet him . When Steve awoke the next morning I was still at my computer , trying to get down dialogue and notes for the book . He 'd never seen me like this because over the years I had learned to treat writing like a nine-to-five job . I took off weekends and holidays just like everyone else . I found that this worked better for me than the lunacy of " waiting for inspiration . " The rent I pay each month for my apartment is all the inspiration I need . Steve was very understanding . He 's an investment banker ( no , I do not allow him to handle my money ; I said I was in love , not insane ) and was a bit fascinated by the creative process . So he ordered his own breakfast from the delicatessen ( in the real world the woman fries eggs for her man ; in New York we dial the telephone for our men ) , and I kept typing . After a while he got bored with hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get me to go out with him to see a movie or walk in the park . But I would n't go . I could n't seem to stop writing about Jamie . Steve said he understood , then decided to leave me to my work ; he 'd see me the next day . But I did n't see him the next day , or the next . In fact I did n't see him for nearly two weeks . I did n't want to see anyone ; I just wanted to write about Jamie . I read books on Scotland until the wee hours of the morning and everything gave me an idea about Jamie . I thought about him , dreamed about him . I could see his dark eyes , his dark hair . I could hear his laugh . I knew what was good about him and what was bad . He was brave and honest ; his honor was such that it was a life force . He was proud to the point that it hindered him . But for all his many virtues he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cat . All he wanted was me  --  I mean , the heroine to wait on him . After two weeks I went out with Steve ; I do n't know what it was , but it was as though I could n't really see him . It was as though I was seeing all the world through a Vaseline-coated lens . Nothing seemed real to me . All I could seem to hear and see was Jamie . Over the next months my obsession with this man only deepened . Steve did everything he could think of to get my attention . He talked to me , pleaded with me to stop working and start paying attention to him . " Where is the woman I fell in love with ? " he asked with a smile , trying to make light of what was hurting him so much . I could n't really answer him . I just wanted to get back to my computer and my research books . I do n't know what I was looking for in the books ; maybe I hoped to " find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through all of this Steve was wonderful . He really did love me . After about four months of complete inattention from me , he begged me to go with him to a counselor . By this time I was feeling guilty . No , correction , I was feeling that I should feel guilty ; what I was actually feeling was that I wanted everyone on the earth to go away and leave me alone with Jamie . For three months , Steve and I had weekly visits with a therapist , talking about my childhood . I was completely uninterested in any of it . I sat there and told them what they wanted to hear , that my mama did n't love me and my daddy did n't love me , et cetera . The truth was , in the back of my mind , I was thinking only of what I wanted to write about Jamie . Had I fully explored the way the sunlight played on his hair ? Had I described the sound of his laughter ? Steve knew very well that I was paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after eight months of receiving nothing from me , he told me he wanted to break our engagement . In a scene that I felt as though I were looking at from a distance , I gave him back his ring . The only thought that was in my head was , Now I can spend all my time with Jamie . When I first told my friend and editor , Daria , about my obsession with this hero , she was thrilled . Obsessed authors write great books . The authors who fail are ones who call their editors and say , " What do you want me to write next ? " Daria was the only person on earth who wanted to hear about this man as much as I wanted to talk about him . Of course , to be honest , Daria had learned to listen to authors while line editing other people 's manuscripts , eating a bagel , and directing her assistant about covers and cover copy . Daria has one humdinger of a brain . But then something odd happened . After about three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I want to see what you 've done . " " No ! " I snapped at her request . Now this is very odd . Writers act as though they have lots of self-confidence , but we all have clay feet . We are in awe of the power of our editors , those first people who see our work . Daria always raves about the first section of a book I turn in to her . Later she may tell me it all needs to go into the trash , but not at first . It 's like , you ca n't tell your best girlfriend that the guy she 's madly in love with is a creep . After she breaks up with him , you can tell her . Anyway , I usually sent Daria my book in fifty-page clumps and started pestering her for her opinion ( i.e. , lavish praise ) before the express service had even picked it up from my door . One book , I sent her the whole five hundred pages in ten-page segments . Wisely , Daria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else all her insecure , praise hungry authors would be faxing her their books page by page then demanding an hour 's praise for every paragraph that they hope is wittily written . By all of this you can see how unusual it was when I did n't want Daria to see what I had written . I told her I wanted to finish the section I was writing before I sent it to her . The truth was , I did n't want her  --  or any other woman to set eyes on my Jamie . Even after months , I still refused to allow Daria to see any of the book , and she began to be concerned . Some writers lie about how much they 're writing , but I knew Daria did n't think this of me , since I write because I love it  --  correction , I write because I must , because I am driven to it . Daria grew more concerned when , a month after it happened , I told her that I had broken my engagement to Steve . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aghast , for we were truly friends , not just business friends . She seemed a little worried when I said that the broken engagement did n't matter , that I had n't been very upset by the breakup . Months went by and I kept writing . When I write , I keep a file named Scenes , and whenever I have an idea about possible bits of dialogue that I might be able to use in the book , I stick it in this file . Being very frugal , I almost always use every word I put into this file . But I had written so much about Jamie that the Scenes file was over six hundred thousand bytes , over four hundred pages , and I had n't yet really started the book . I kept telling myself that I needed to do a bit more research or needed to know just a tiny bit more about Jamie before I could actually start writing the book itself . I had Jamie and my heroine , who was named Caitlin , in every possible situation . I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Twenty-five books I had written , and I 'd never before felt this need , but then I 'd never before felt this way about a character I 'd made up . Oh , I often felt as though I were " in love " with a hero , but it was nothing compared to what I felt about Jamie . Months went by and still I kept writing notes for my book . Jamie was no longer a Scotsman but an Englishman in the time of Queen Elizabeth I. Daria was more than annoyed with me as I still would n't allow her to see anything I 'd written . She reminded me that I was past my due date ; it had no effect on me . She sent me a copy of the cover and talked to me about all the people at my publishing house who were depending on me , something that I usually cared a great deal about . But I did n't care about anyone or anything , just Jamie . I think it was the wedding invitation I received from Steve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I know it was probably a bitter , hurtful thing he did , sending me that pretty , engraved invitation , letting me know that I had truly lost him , but actually it was the best thing that could have happened to me . I realized that I had discarded a real , live , utterly wonderful man for a character I had created on paper . I realized that I had not talked to any of my friends in months and that the romance trade papers were running little gossip bits about , What ever happened to Hayden Lane ? But realization can not stop something that 's bad . All smokers know they should quit , but that does n't make them able to stop the habit . But when I was able to admit to myself that I did indeed have a problem , I decided to get help . I spent three months going to a therapist every day . That was useless . No one had even conceived of a case like mine . At first I tried to keep it from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my imagination , but I have a big mouth and I 'm not good at intrigue , so she soon found out . Her advice was to get out more , see people . I tried , but that did n't work because I bored everyone to death with " Jamie says " and " Jamie likes " and " Jamie does . " When therapy did n't seem to be working , I started trying other methods of figuring out what was wrong with me . In New York , there 's a palm reader , a psychic , a tarot card reader , some esoteric something on every corner . I went to several of them . I guess I hoped that someone would tell me that within a week or two I 'd be back to my old self . But not one of them told me anything helpful . They told me I was rich and famous and had a star in my palm that meant I was " special . " They told me the people at my work were beginning to think I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were nitroglycerine about to go off . In other words , they did n't tell me anything I did n't already know . At home , I cried a lot and yearned for Jamie all the time . I did n't just want to write about him , I wanted to feel him , touch him , talk to him . I wanted to follow his long legs down country paths ; I wanted to bear his children . I do n't know what would have happened , or how long all of this would have gone on , if I had n't met Nora . Like a spider sitting in the midst of her web , she had an office across from my hairdresser 's with a huge red neon sign that said ASTROLOGY . As I sat there with foil in my hair ( my hair is white blonde and I get downlights to make it look more " natural " weird , huh ? ) I thought , I think I 'll go have my chart done . I say that Nora is like a spider because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do . She put the sign up to attract people . Nora really is a clairvoyant , and as soon as I sat down and asked for my chart to be done , she said , " How about a psychic reading , instead ? " I said , " Sure , " and that one word was the beginning of everything .
