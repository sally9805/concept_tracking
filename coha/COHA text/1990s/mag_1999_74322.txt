Before the championship was even decided , some observers at Charlotte 's Ericsson Stadium were calling it the most transcendent play in the 41 years of the NCAA men 's soccer tournament . As Indiana protected a 1-0 lead with 20 minutes left in last Sunday 's final , Santa Clara 's Anthony Chimienti lashed a shot that had already beaten goalkeeper T.J. Hannig when Hoosiers sweeper Nick Garcia suddenly transformed himself into a pair of ER lifesaving shock paddles . Throwing his body headlong toward the back of his own goal ( Garcia would end up stuck in the net like a tuna caught at sea ) , he somehow nodded the ball upward in the opposite direction , off the crossbar , and it caromed harmlessly out of danger . Shock paddles attached ... CLEAR ! // " I thought it had skimmed off my head and gone in , " Garcia said , admitting that he did n't know what had transpired in the scramble . Duly saved , Indiana held on for the win and its second straight national title , a trophy it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back-line dominance raised an interesting question : Could the best college player in America be a defender who did n't score a goal all season ? // Well , yes . Never mind Garcia 's goal line theatrics . Anyone who thinks soccer players ca n't use their hands has n't watched him direct the Hoosiers with the panache of a latter-day Arthur Fiedler . Garcia 's hands are constantly in motion . He 'll thrust them downward to calm his team before an opposing corner kick . He 'll jerk them upward to plead for the ball in transition . He 'll flap them forward to keep the back line even as it advances upfield . In fact , watching Garcia choreograph Indiana 's offside trap calls to mind the scene from The Full Monty in which Robert Carlyle teaches line-dancing by invoking Arsenal 's offside trap . " Nick is a puppeteer out there , " says Indiana coach Jerry Yeagley , " whether he 's behind the team , in front of the team , anywhere . " // Or everywhere . Free to roam where he pleases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes game-saving stops in front of his own goal . Surely he 's the only athlete in the country whose coach compares him in one breath to Jim Hen-son and in another to a world-famous firefighter  --  " He 's our Red Adair "  --  yet both descriptions fit . In Indiana 's 3-2 four-overtime win over UCLA in the semis , Garcia cleared a sure Bruins goal off the line with a lunging leftfooted jab only five seconds from the end of the second OT . // A junior who has discouraged professional interest from Major League Soccer and Europe since high school , Garcia has been a throwback in today 's college game . In the three years since MLS instituted Project-40 , a program that encourages top young players to skip college and go pro in return for future tuition money , the upper reaches of college soccer have been decimated . Thirty-eight players have taken the Project-40 plunge , or 12.7 a year  --  compared with the 16 college underclassmen and high school seniors drafted by the NBA last year . " Indiana is a unique situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get quality training day in and day out , " Garcia said before Sunday 's game . // Nevertheless , Garcia surprised nobody when he announced after the final that he would give up his last year of eligibility to turn pro  --  in MLS or Europe . " Indiana can only give me so much , " he said , " and it 's in my best interest to go forward and play with better players , at a higher level . " // With that , Garcia took the next step in a soccer journey that began in his hometown of Piano , Texas . Nick was only five when he started practicing with the 17-and 18-year-old boys on a club team coached by his father , Phil . " They 'd knock him down , pick him up and dust him off , and then off he 'd go , " Phil recalls . " He never cried , either . That was when he learned not to have any fear . " // Garcia was a national player of the year at Dallas 's Bishop Lynch High @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in international play , serving as a co-captain at last spring 's Under-20 World Cup in Nigeria and emerging as a top candidate for the U.S. team at the 2000 Olympics and , perhaps , the 2002 World Cup . He is widely considered to be one of the toughest young players in the country , as he showed with his goal line clear on Sunday  --  and , unfortunately , his head-butt of Santa Clara 's Kyle Smith after Smith crashed into Hannig in the box . // Still , Garcia will have to change a few habits when he starts his pro career . On road trips this year he took along a Beanie Baby monkey named Bongo , and one wonders if hard-bitten German or Belgian footballers will find stuffed animals amusing . Then again , it 's a measure of Garcia 's talent that weaning himself from kiddie toys may be his biggest professional challenge .
