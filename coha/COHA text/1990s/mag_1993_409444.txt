Head and neck injuries may be the most serious accidents sportsmen face . Remember that gruesome picture of New York Jets defensive end Dennis Byrd breaking his neck after he ran headfirst into his teammate ? The doctors on the scene quickly immobilized the football player 's neck and brought him off the field . Now picture your hunting partner with a similar injury , after he runs headlong into a tree while chasing grouse . Would you know what to do ? I have doctored sportsmen who have sustained serious head and neck injuries in almost every imaginable way : falling off ledges while fishing in gorges , falling out of tree stands , falling off cliffs while trying to find shortcuts back to camp , and , yes , running into trees , to list just a few . Head and neck injuries are especially dangerous because by their very nature they render you practically helpless and dependent on others for survival . If you break your ankle in the woods , you can always splint the injured limb , fashion a crutch out of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you are knocked senseless , however , you wo n't be able to help yourself . You are totally reliant on your partner , if you are lucky enough to have one , to administer first aid and get you out of the wilderness . Prevention , as always , is the best medicine , but if you hunt and fish in the back country , you 'd better know how to deal with head and neck injuries . HEAD INJURIES What do you do when your buddy is knocked out cold by a recoiling branch ? Drag him back to camp by his feet ? Throw a bucket of cold water in his face ? You 'd better not . If he has a serious head injury , cold water wo n't revive him . And if he has a broken neck , you could cause permanent paralysis by moving him without first splinting his cervical spine ( neck ) . Approach the head injury victim the way you would approach any trauma victim ( see " Fighting Shock , " Sports Medicine Department , Outdoor Life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , check his ABCs ( Airway , Breathing and Circulation ) , then quickly examine him from head to toe . After you have checked him for chest , abdominal , pelvic and extremity injuries , evaluate his head injury by checking the following : * EYE OPENING : Does he open his eyes spontaneously , on command or only in response to pain ? * VERBAL RESPONSE : Ask him a few simple questions , such as what his name is , who the president is , and so on . Is his speech clear ? Does he make sense , or is he confused and disoriented ? If he thinks that he 's in Upper Volta and Harry Truman is president , he 's got a problem . * MOTOR RESPONSE : Does he obey simple commands ? Can he touch his nose , lift his hand ? If not , does he withdraw when you pinch him ? * PUPILLARY RESPONSES : Are his pupils round and symmetrical ? Do they constrict when you shine a light into his eyes ? Based on these responses , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head injuries : * CONCUSSION : If he wakes up after a short period of unconsciousness and can talk and move his limbs normally , he has probably had a simple concussion , which is a transient disruption of brain function . He may not remember the accident , and he may have a headache and difficulty concentrating for a few days , but he probably will be fine . * INTRACRANIAL BLEEDING : If he remains unconscious , or wakes up for a short period and then becomes unresponsive , he may have intracranial bleeding  --  a blood clot between the brain and the skull ( epidural or subdural hematoma ) or bleeding within the substance of the brain ( intracerebral bleeding ) . Intracranial bleeding is a life-threatening emergency . Because the brain is encased in the rigid skull , which ca n't expand , intracranial bleeding causes the pressure within the head to increase . When the pressure exceeds a critical level , blood flow to the brain stops , and the brain cells , deprived of essential oxygen and glucose , die within minutes . * SKULL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , " bleeding from the ear canals and drainage of clear fluid from the nose or ears are all signs of a fracture of the base of the skull . If the victim has a scalp laceration , carefully examine the wound . Can you see a skull fracture , defect or depression ? Is there an obvious open brain injury ? Skull fractures per se are not life-threatening , but about half the time they are complicated by brain injury or intracranial bleeding , and the victim needs to be brought to a hospital . Do n't try to clean an open skull fracture , and never pull an arrow , stone or any other penetrating object out of the skull . By doing that you will only stir up more bleeding and likely compound the brain injury . Simply apply a sterile dressing and a turban bandage and keep the victim as comfortable as possible while awaiting evacuation . NECK AND SPINAL CORD INJURIES Anyone with a head injury has a neck injury until proven otherwise . If the victim does have a broken neck and you attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cord and cause paralysis . Check for neck injury by doing the following : * If he is conscious , ask if his neck or back hurts . If he says no and can move his head comfortably in all directions , he probably does n't have a serious neck injury . * Next , run your fingers down his spinal column from the base of his skull to his tail bone and feel for deformities or tenderness . If this exam is normal , and he can move his neck painlessly , you can safely move him . If head movement is painful or his spine is tender , have an assistant support his head while you wrap a rolled-up shirt or jacket snugly around his neck and secure it with safety pins or adhesive tape . Alternatively , you can immobilize his neck by placing " sandbags " ( sacks stuffed with clothing or filled with dirt ) on either side of his head and neck . Anchor the sandbags with rocks , or stretch a long piece of two-inch adhesive tape across his forehead and tuck the ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a back injury , do n't move him . After you have immobilized the victim 's spine , check for these signs of spinal cord injury : * Neck or back pain radiating down the arms or legs . * Numbness or tingling in the hands or feet . * Loss of feeling in the arms or legs . * Weakness or paralysis of arms or legs . * A sustained penile erection . * Inability to urinate . Any penetrating wound to the neck , especially to the front of the neck , is a potentially life-threatening injury . The trachea ( windpipe ) , esophagus ( food tube ) , carotid arteries , jugular veins and the nerve that supplies the diaphragm all lie just an inch or two under the skin . When confronted with such an injury , no matter how trivial it looks , immobilize the victim and tend to his ABCs . If there is a penetrating object , do not attempt to remove it . Rather , secure it in place as best you can so that it does no further harm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how deep it is . The most innocent-appearing wounds can be surprisingly deep . Control bleeding with gentle pressure and get your buddy out of there , under his own power if he is up to it , or by litter or helicopter if he is in distress . IN THE DEEP WOODS Anyone with a serious head or neck injury needs to be evacuated to a hospital as quickly as possible . But if you are in the back country , that may require a helicopter and trained wilderness emergency medical technicians . If there are three or more in your party , send the fittest person on the run for help and make sure that he can find his way back to you with rescue personnel . Build a fire to raise smoke or contrive some other highly visible signal to guide rescuers to your location . If you must leave your injured buddy alone while you go for help , stabilize his other injuries as well as you can , give him his fill of water if he is alert , make sure that he is bundled up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him from the elements . Offer him aspirin or acetaminophen , and put some padding under his elbows , buttocks and heels so that he does n't develop pressure sores . <p>
