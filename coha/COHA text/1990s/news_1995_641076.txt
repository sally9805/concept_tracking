<p> ' Blind babies ' column adds to public fear of disabilities <p> Would you hire someone because you felt sorry for them ? Would you have an intimate relationship based solely on pity ? Do you feel that the lives of the people you value most are tragic ? Do you have high expectations of those you consider unfortunate ? <p> Most people will answer " no " to the above questions . If you answered yes to any of them , you may need to examine your motives . <p> In this climate of self-sufficiency and dislike of those " poor people " who receive government benefits , disabled Americans want more than ever to be afforded the opportunity of working and participating fully in their communities . The image projected upon us by the media often works against this goal . When the image is one of pity , readers and viewers in the community do not see people with disabilities as able to contribute or worthy of a valued role in society such as a job . <p> In the Dec. 18 Post , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His dramatic detailing of " a dark scary world " and " having to learn how to grasp without ever having seen a hand " adds to the general public 's fear and pity of people with disabilities . <p> The point of the column seemed to be related to monetary donations , both received and needed for a preschool for children who are blind . Often liberals and organizations claiming to represent people with disabilities pull on America 's heartstrings to fatten their own pocketbooks . Green mentions in his piece that nothing he had seen as a seasoned reporter could have prepared him for this horrific scene . Regardless of the motive for such inaccurate portrayal , it serves only to perpetuate myths . <p> These tactics used to obtain funds do severe damage to people with disabilities . The harm far outweighs the benefit that any of these charities may provide to the disabled population . They influence employers , leading to more than 75 percent unemployment among disabled people . They influence judges and custody evaluators , leading to the destruction of families which have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deny regular education to disabled youth , keeping them locked away in segregated classrooms . <p> Writing articles or opinions on disabled people or disability organizations is valid . Persons with disabilities represent 10 percent of the general population . Learning about diverse groups of people is important . Yet , using pity and scare tactics is both inaccurate and damaging . Pathos belongs in a tabloid , but not in a respected major newspaper . If there is a desire to educate the public about children ( or adults ) who are blind or visually impaired , there are many other more professional options available . <p> Write a piece about the use of guide dogs . Do an investigative piece about the effectiveness of local mobility-training programs - anything that is not wild sensationalism . The public wants and expects accuracy from its news sources . <p> I have many friends and colleagues who are blind or visually impaired . None of them would describe their lives as dark or dismal . They all have full and active lives , and their blindness is not the focus of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , friends , partners , parents and teachers had all read and believed an article such as the one written by Green , would their lives indeed have been dark and dismal ? <p> JULIE REISKIN <p> Colorado Cross Disability Coalition <p> Denver <p> Editorial on Robert Friedland contained errors and innuendos <p> The Jan. 1 Denver Post editorial about Robert Friedland contained a number of errors and innuendos . <p> First Dynasty Mines Ltd. was not associated with the Summitville mine . Nor , to my knowledge , was Friedland involved in the operation of Summitville . The Post continues to mislead the public into believing Friedland was solely responsible for environmental problems ; in reality the mine was operated by some of the top managers and legal and technical consultants in the international mining industry . As problems began , state and federal regulators issued conflicting and sometimes unattainable directives . Many people were involved in Summitville . <p> First Dynasty Mines acquired properties from another company in which Friedland owned shares , in exchange for shares in our company . We carefully assessed the quality of the assets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly in identifying attractive natural resources ventures . <p> Friedland does not manage or operate mining companies ; he is a venture capitalist . He has no say in the management of First Dynasty Mines , no control over our operations and is not a director of the company . In fact , he has ceded some usual shareholder rights . We may work with him in the future because of his ability to find , evaluate and acquire new assets . <p> We are a high-quality company intent upon building ourselves into a true global natural resource operating company . Our recently announced agreement to acquire assets in Indonesia ( which gave rise to The Post 's editorial , but which was basically ignored ) will result in Robert Friedland 's percentage ownership in the company being significantly reduced . <p> The managers of First Dynasty Mines have impeccable environmental track records . As the former CEO of Amax Gold , I headed an organization which won the prestigious Dupont Award for Environmental Excellence , along with other state and federal environmental awards . We intend to run First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> All of our managers were attracted bythe philosophy of being involved in a start-up company with excellent capital-raising abilities and a good , honest and ethical management team . <p> What disturbs me most about your editorial is a demand that First Dynasty be linked with Summitville . According to your philosophy , the cost of an environmental mistake should be borne by companies who were not even in existence at the time of the event . Using this same logic , no newspaper should be allowed to operate because another newspaper , perhaps financed by the same investors , went bankrupt . <p> It is nice that The Denver Post concedes First Dynasty Mines " had nothing to do with Summitville , " but the juxtaposition of headlines and photos in a recently published article in your newspaperconveyed the opposite impression . Should all present and future Post staff members and journalists everywhere be held accountable for that mistake ? <p> Over the years I have enjoyed an excellent working relationship with The Denver Post . I have come to expect a rational , reasonable and fair examination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team and impugns the credibility of a company which will make every effort to demonstrate corporate and environmental stewardship in its operations . Who holds your Editorial Page staff responsible and liable for the mess you leave in your wake ? <p> TIMOTHY J. HADDON <p> Chairman , President and CEO <p> First Dynasty Mines <p> Denver <p> Wyoming penitentiary is in Rawlins <p> Newspapers are supposed to be a source of reliable information . Yet The Denver Post apparently can not bother to check a map of our neighbor to the north to learn the correct spelling of the city in which the Wyoming State Penitentiary is located . <p> In the Dec. 29 Post , near the top of page 1 of the Denver &; the West section is a story in which , not once , but three times , that city is called " Rollins . " <p> I think it is shameful that the reporter and probably at least one of your editors do not know even that much about our next-door neighbor . But if they do n't know , could n't they look it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as a correction . I 'll save you the trouble of looking it up - the Wyoming State Penitentiary is in RAWLINS . Not " Rawlings , " not " Rahlens " and certainly not " Rollins . " <p> LOU LAYMAN <p> Denver <p> Schoolmates remember the person they knewUpon seeing the published article that appeared in your newspaper on Dec. 20 , regarding the drug investigation at Highlands Ranch High School and the suicide of Kristopher Bolte , we , as Highlands Ranch High School students , readers of your newspaper and human beings , were outraged . <p> We are unable to understand why a supposedly intelligent newspaper would choose to be so hypocritical in its judgment as to publicize a negative and painful subject while ignoring the other things that set Highlands Ranch above and beyond many other schools . <p> We were also very upset at the total omission of the other qualities Kris possessed . <p> We are n't claiming Highlands Ranch High School is perfect , but what we are asking is that people be given a chance to see Highlands Ranch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living , breathing , car- ing individual he was . <p> All of us have made mistakes in our lives . That 's only human . <p> But as long as these mistakes are seen as " news " to startle and shock our community , as long as they are brought up again and again to haunt all of us , the students , staff and families of Highlands Ranch are not going to be able to get past them to heal . <p> We ask you to consider how you would like to remember someone who was a part of your life - as a scandalous article on the front page of the daily newspaper , or as the person who really existed - to remember the negative or to see the whole . Many of us at Highlands Ranch have chosen to remember Kris as the person he was . We ask the newspapers and the rest of the community to respect our decision . <p> MELINA COATES <p> CHRISTINA VON STROH <p> Highlands Ranch <p> It was Congress that exploded the deficitEd Quillen , in his Dec. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficit in the ongoing revision of history by liberals . He blames Republicans for tripling the deficit during the 12 years they held the White House . This is the " big lie " that Democrats use against Reagan and Bush . <p> I was here in this country all during the ' 80s and can attest to the fact that there was no revolution by an Imperial Presidency that overthrew Congress and usurped from them the exclusive control of the budget . <p> Only the Congress of this nation can spend or not spend and tax or not tax - borrowing or not borrowing to cover the difference . <p> LEE SELLERS <p> Northglenn <p> Did shooting exhibit <p> a double standard ? <p> The recent incident of an off-duty police officer allegedly shooting a citizen in the back certainly appears to be just another example of professional courtesy , or a double standard if you please , as the police officer is released at the scene and later put on inside duty by the Denver Police Department .

COFFEY <p> Littleton <p> Person who abused dog <p> should be named to public <p> Regarding the abused pup who lost a leg because of being in the hands of a wrongful owner : Should n't the person 's name be publicized who committed an unforgiveable act of violence toward a defenseless animal ? <p> And one does not have to strike a dog for doing wrong - if this dog indeed did wrong . Looks and tone of voice are quite enough . <p> PATRICIA L. SHAY <p> Estes Park <p> Post should be ashamed <p> for childish name-calling <p> I have never read a column so vitriolic and filled with hate as the one written by Linda Bowles Jan. 1 . But the thing that bothers me the most is that I read it in The Denver Post , which I have read all my life and always respected . Childish name-calling in The Post ? It saddens me . <p> FLORENCE SMITH <p> Castle Rock
