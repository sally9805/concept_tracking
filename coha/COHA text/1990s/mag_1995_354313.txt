DIED . DARREN ROBINSON , 28 , one of the Fat Boys , three rotund rappers of the 1980s who praised hip-hop , hedonism and high cholesterol in a series of gold albums and boisterous B films ; of cardiac arrest during a bout of the flu ; in New York City . <P> DIED . VIVIAN BLAINE , 74 , actress ; of congestive heart failure ; in New York City . In the first years of the ' 50s , audiences were drawn to Broadway by the singing , dancing swirl of gamblers , cops and missionaries in Frank Loesser 's Guys and Dolls . But it was a lone blond in an empty nightclub who stopped the show , poignantly , comically complaining in song of her unmarried state . The five minutes of adenoidal lyricism known as Adelaide 's Lament made Vivian Blaine a White Way legend , so linked to the character of the warmhearted show girl who spoke Runyonese that she was the only lead from the original run to appear in the 1955 movie ( opposite Frank Sinatra as the altar-averse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 77 , writer , philanthropist and influential grand master of the dinner-party politics of being wife of a diplomat ( Foreign Service fixture David Bruce ) at home and abroad ; in Washington . <P> DIED . DOUGLAS ( " Wrong Way " ) CORRIGAN , 88 , aviator ; in Orange , California . The high-flying Corrigan broke no records for air speed or distance but set a new standard for sheer gall . In July 1938 federal officials in New York examined Corrigan 's aircraft and , deciding it owed more to Rube Goldberg than Orville Wright , refused to approve his planned transatlantic flight . Corrigan agreed to return to California  --  but once in the air , headed east . Touching down in Ireland 28 hours later , Corrigan , straight-faced but twinkle-eyed , attributed his detour to a faulty compass . This combination of chutzpah and heroism propelled him to international celebrity , leading to a Hollywood biopic ( he played himself ) and a lifetime of personal appearances .                 @ @ @ @
