A Romanesque mansion in Chicago was built to forbid outsiders while providing a warm welcome to guests within <p> May 15 , 1885 . The architect Henry Hobson Richardson peered out of a carriage window at the corner lot on Chicago 's Prairie Avenue and then turned to his client and asked , " Have you the courage to build the house without windows on the street front ? " <p> The young John Jacob Glessner promptly responded , " Yes . " In this way the design for one of Richardson 's most criticized and most influential buildings was commissioned for one of the newest of Chicago 's new rich . Glessner 's courage , however , was not unalloyed ; he realized he could still reject the final plans . Ultimately , the industrialist 's new house was the result of many compromises , some courageous , some less so . <p> For one thing , the house would have windows on the street front . But the long east facade fronting Eighteenth Street was exceedingly austere , its few narrow windows contributing to a severe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the structure lacked the kind of excessive ornamentation that was typical of the houses of the day . Few concessions were made to curious onlookers . <p> Richardson died before construction was actually begun on the house , but there is no doubt that the final result accurately reflected his concept . At Richardson 's last meeting with the Glessners , three weeks before his death , the architect marked on the plans the locations of lighting fixtures , then turned to his client and said , " There , Mr. Glessner , if I were to live five years longer , that is the last thing I would do on your house ; my part is finished . " It was now up to the contractors and the full-time superintendent overseeing construction , old associates of Richardson , to carry out the plan . Glessner was very likely correct when years later he wrote to his children , " I am convinced that this house of ours is the one of all that he built that he would have liked most to live in himself . " <p> Glessner 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; rarely has it been described as pretty . One contemporary called it a " gargantuan freak . " Many of Glessner 's neighbors on fashionable Prairie Avenue would have agreed . The leaders of Chicago 's new industrial age , the Otises , Armours , Fields , and Pullmans , were disconcerted by Richardson 's creation . George Pullman , the railway-car manufacturer , spoke for all when he complained , " I do n't know what I have done to have that thing staring me in the face every time I go out of my door . " <p> The house that Richardson and Glessner built was a caterpillar , a tadpole , a life-form still incomplete . Somewhere inside there was , possibly , a beautiful building struggling to get out . This embryonic form did n't just reflect a struggle of architectural design and style . It was the manifestation of a generation trying to shake off the trappings of the dying century before it assumed those of the new . <p> The " battle of styles , " which had been the hallmark of early-nineteenth-century architectural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nineteenth century . Antebellum architectural styles were frequently imagined as carrying political and moral implications . The neoclassical styles celebrated the rationalism of the Renaissance and stood in fundamental opposition to the Gothic Revival styles that revered the spiritualism of the Middle Ages . The classical formula emphasized the orderly and harmonious placement of the elements of the facade and was essentially interested in the building 's outward form . The Gothic approach , on the other hand , emphasized the complexity of interior space . It looked inward and upward . Gothic vaults supported towering spires that reached , as many people thought , toward God . <p> The idealism that energized the battle of styles , however , was one of the many casualties of the Civil War . Postwar architecture commonly emphasized the picturesque and eclectic rearrangement of architectural elements , without reference to any unifying philosophy . The main concern now was to create an interesting silhouette on the horizon , a pleasing shadow against the sky . <p> Richardson , by contrast , looked back in time and infused his architecture with a renewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms and Gothic space to create a powerful architecture of mass . Two of his most famous commissions , Trinity Church in Boston and the Marshall Field Wholesale Store in Chicago , were carried out with huge stone blocks bearing rough , chiseled surfaces . Interiors , too , emphasized natural materials that powerfully shaped the union of space and form . <p> For Richardson this may have been a personal as well as an intellectual choice . His own tremendous bulk ( he weighed well over three hundred pounds ) was reflected in the buildings he designed . Even the wide , round arches surrounding windows and entrances-the hallmark of the Richardsonian Romanesque style , which represented a compromise between Gothic pointed arches and classical lintels-seemed designed to welcome personages whose figures were as imposing as that of the architect . <p> In creating his own architectural style , Richardson was of the absolute avant-garde of his day-which meant that he was deeply immersed in the past . Richardson 's time , and thus his architecture , were located at a point where medievalism and modernism met . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cotton and sugar-cane fields of his parents ' Mississippi River plantation , been educated at Harvard with Henry Adams and other sons of Boston 's first families , and spent the war years studying at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris . In a sense he was the work of three civilizations . As a firsthand witness to the destruction of one of them , he perhaps believed he was observing , too , the death throes of the comfortable social compact he enjoyed in Boston and in France , as the modern world had its uneasy birth in the final tumultuous decades of the nineteenth century . <p> What Mark Twain called the Gilded Age was a period of comparative peace for many who were weary of the divisions that had come to a head with the war , which was still so vivid in memory . It was also a period criticized for its complacency , greed , and political corruption . The nation was on its way to becoming the world 's foremost industrial power , but before that could occur , one of the greatest mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into America 's cities , bringing new nationalities , new cultures , and new philosophies . In these decades the country passed through a physical transformation that rivaled the philosophical adjustments of the war years . Labor strikes , major urban riots , and economic dislocations were the outward signs of a social polarization that threatened to turn America into a nation of haves and have-nots . The turn of the century would see the emergence of a large and powerful middle class that would embrace a political and social ideology of progressive reforms , but to many social critics the late 1800s were an uneasy time . It is perhaps not remarkable that Richardson , like many of his contemporaries , was consumed by nostalgia for a golden age . His admiration for the long-lost past led him upon occasion to wear the habit of a medieval monk , and the houses he designed for America 's new aristocracy would have been recognizable in twelfth-century Europe . <p> John J. Glessner , his client , was generally more optimistic than Richardson . Glessner would die many years later , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richardson died in 1886 , at forty-seven , virtually penniless despite his great success as an architect . Still , Glessner , like many of his neighbors on Prairie Avenue , could n't entirely escape the eruptions of modern time . The fire that had swept the growing city of Chicago in 1871 was a precursor to social conflagrations that swept the city in the following years . Glessner 's previous house on Washington Street in downtown Chicago had already been subject to numerous thefts and robberies ; on one occasion he had drawn a revolver on a surprised intruder . From their former house the Glessners could hear the explosion and gunshots of the Haymarket Square Riot of May 4 , 1886 , in which several people died during the clash between police and a crowd agitating for an eight-hour day at International Harvester 's Chicago plant . Glessner 's cranky neighbor George Pullman would soon see his model town of Pullman , Illinois , the production center of luxury railroad cars , under siege in one of America 's first modern labor strikes . The strike was not resolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Even Glessner 's decision to locate his new house on the edge of the city represented a short-lived solution to the problems of urban living . For the well-off the benefits of the city-various services such as gas and water and a round of social and cultural events-still outweighed the advantages of a more rural life . The creation of modern suburbs and the resulting hemorrhage of wealthy and middle-class families from the cities were barely under way . Glessner 's house stood as a medieval fortress . Its austere exterior was designed as much for defense as for show . Yet within it one could find all the trappings of medieval hospitality . <p> A carriage entrance , which compromised the severe geometry of the south facade , allowed visitors to drive directly into the courtyard . Seen from within the courtyard , the house presented a warm contrast with its streetside appearance . Here the exterior was characterized by complex and playful surfaces . Circular bays and towers , a conservatory , a winding staircase , and a profusion of chimneys crowning the roof delighted the eye . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an easy flow of traffic through a variety of spaces defined by natural materials and exposed woodwork . Artisan-crafted furniture , some designed by William Morris and Isaac Scott , filled the welcoming spaces in which the domestic needs of the household and the requirements of expansive hospitality were equally met . The Glessners often entertained some of Chicago 's most prominent businessmen and their families . On more than one occasion the house comfortably hosted the entire Chicago Symphony Orchestra , and regularly on Monday mornings Mrs. Glessner 's reading group met for refreshments , intellectual stimulation , and an opportunity to catch up on their sewing . <p> Yet the Glessner house also had distinctly modern features that came to influence both the major schools of architecture that battled for dominance in the early twentieth century . Two of Richardson 's assistants , Charles McKim and Stanford White , later joined with William Mead to form the most prestigious and influential architectural firm in turn-of-the-century America . Their Beaux-Arts classicism , seen at its best in New York 's now-defunct Pennsylvania Station and the Boston Public Library , dominated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just as important was Richardson 's influence upon a younger generation of architects who were critical of what they saw as the frivolous , prettified , wedding-cake architecture of the BeauxArts school . Most notable among this new school was Chicago 's own Louis Sullivan , an ardent admirer of Richardson , who frequently incorporated Richardson 's low-sprung arches into his own work . Sullivan 's student Frank Lloyd Wright , the prophet of modernism , was also deeply influenced by the master of medievalism . At first glance no two architects could be more dissimilar than Wright and Richardson . Yet in Richardson 's work , especially at the Glessner house , we can see the origins of an approach to new architectural problems that we associate almost entirely with Wright . The minimalist exterior , the disdain for ornamentation , the emphasis on natural materials , exposed structural elements , and the emphasis on traffic flow were common to both Richardson and Wright . At bottom , Wright 's " architecture of democracy " ( as Wright called it ) had its roots in Richardson 's architecture of aristocracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , partly perhaps because his early death prevented him from fulfilling the promise of his mature work . Some of his buildings did not survive long after his death ; the solutions he devised were uniquely suited to situations that he confronted in his own time-solutions made obsolete by the new technologies and social realities of the twentieth century . It is perhaps fitting that Richardson 's most lasting monuments should be the many rural libraries and train stations that he designed , with those easily identifiable wide arches and efficient traffic flows . In these buildings we see the harbingers of the eventual triumph of the American suburb . <p> Like many historic houses , the Glessner house has passed through some sorry times in the years since it was built . By 1900 the Prairie Avenue address had already lost its panache as it was swallowed up by the downtown area 's commercial expansion . In the 1920s Al Capone 's favorite hotel , the Lexington , stood just a few blocks away . Fortunately in 1967 the house came into the hands of the Chicago Architecture Foundation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way it must have looked just after the Glessners moved in , in 1887 . <p> The Glessner House is open to the public on Wednesdays and Fridays from 1:00 to 3:00 and Saturdays and Sundays from 1:00 to 4:00. 1-ours of the house cost five dollars per person . For more information , call 312-922-3432 . INTERIOR LIFE <p> Both Mr. and Mrs. Glessner made themselves familiar with the theory and literature of contemporary interior design . They called on the skills of the best artists of their day , especially from the Arts and Crafts movement , to create interiors as inviting and expressive of warm family life as the exterior was intentionally forbidding . <p> PHOTO : Above , an earthenware vase from about 1890 , made by William DeMorgan who also designed decorative tiles for the house .

( ALEXANDER BOULTON ) <p> THE PUBLIC DOMAIN <p> Although Richardson achieved international fame and enjoyed the patronage of America 's newly rich industrialists during his shortened career , his domestic architecture was not widely copied . Perhaps this is because , as one critic noted , in his " desire to be daringly new he achieves a sort of gay heaviness . " But with his public buildings , in all their rugged dignity , he perfected a style perfectly suited to the new , rough industrial age , one that continued to be imitated for decades . Even now , a walk through the downtown of any American city will reveal , as an architect said in 1921 , " large monumental square buildings which appear like meteors from other planets .
