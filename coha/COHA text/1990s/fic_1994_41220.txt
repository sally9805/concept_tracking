The waiter called me over from my table with a wave . It was a wave first with his hand , but then with his eyebrow and his smile , and with a nod of his head to be sure . He called me over more with these than with his hand , and so I got up . In an unfamiliar place , one pays attention . One uses for ears the eyes as well . <p> But this attentiveness was not for much . The waiter , who turned out to be the owner , was simply occupied with washing glasses and did n't want to be bothered with coming over to my table . He thought I was the good sort , and that I would n't mind , he said . So he had taken the chance , that I would not be offended . And anyway , a person always took a chance one way or another with strangers , did n't I think so ? <p> He looked at me up and down with his bigger eye . He did it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his question . That eye also said it had not seen me around here before . But if he indeed said anything aloud , his words were muffled behind the plate he was drying by blowing on it . He had done the same with each of the glasses , a shake , a little drying , and then blowing . <p> The rhythm of it all should have been comforting , but it was not . It said instead that the waiter , the owner , knew what to do , and I did not . I had the menu , but he knew what to do with the glasses . <p> The place was open-air after entering , a restaurant and a bar and a coffeehouse all in one . Just behind and to the side of him was an opening to a garden , a whole wall missing , but leading to tables surrounded by bougainvillea and ivy . <p> Without turning to see where I was glancing , he said to me , " It 's very beautiful , do n't you think ? Everyone goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bees , and sometimes the wasps , it 's perfect . I put up some nets for shade . Do you like them ? " <p> I nodded my head , even though I could n't see them . I could only see the shade . " It looks very nice , " I said . I was a little embarrassed as the words stayed a little too long in my mouth . I had come here to this town in Sonora from Arizona , and my Spanish was good , but certainly not perfect . It 's just what had happened through the years and between generations . But we came from the small towns here , in the middle and in the north of Sonora , Rayon and Cucurpe , San Ignacio , towns like this one . <p> was in the right place . <p> " Then that is where you should sit . Come on . " He wiped his hands on his apron , got what seemed to be a menu different from what I was holding , and began to lead me out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hoped not . <p> I had not seen the garden area on first entering , and yet now it seemed to hold the entire place . I had looked only straight ahead in this place , and not to the right or to the left . <p> He stopped when I did n't quite follow , looking at my first table and the notebook I had left lying there . <p> " Oh , do n't worry , I ' 11 bring it , " he said , but it was n't enough . He could tell . " Oh , and do n't worry , there are no bees right now . No bees and no wasps . It 's not the season . " <p> I started to follow him . I had n't meant to be stubborn , and my standing motionless had been only a small moment , but it 's true that I had just stood there . <p> " You 'd know that if you were from here , " he said , " no bees right now , " and he walked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notebook myself and followed him to the garden tables , which were quiet and cool in the netted mid-morning light . The sun was on the other side of the building 's roof , and the birds were happy . He stood by a table and nodded to it . <p> I sat , but in pulling out my chair made the noise of a chair being pulled out . It 's not much , but unmistakable as a noise . Some birds flew , and the nets moved a little . He had gotten the netting strung up high , over the tops of the umbrella trees , but with some netting under them as well to catch the yellow seed balls . One fell through , and bounced simply off the brick floor into the garden . <p> " It 's too early for lunch , " he said to me . " Maybe you want some coffee ? Some pan dulce ? It 's fresh ? " <p> Everything he said had a question mark , but nothing was a question . He was already starting to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was right . <p> Strangers had passed through town before , of course , he said . Most were confused or nervous , but some took control . Some strangers were stronger than others . <p> " They 're the ones . " He looked at me again , with that up-and-down glance , and again with his larger eye . But this time his look was a joke , and we laughed . <p> " I understand , " I said , and I meant it . They 're the ones to look out for , I supposed he was saying . I was a stranger here , after all , but I had n't thought much of it , not in those terms . I was a stranger to this town , it was true , but I understood what he said . Be careful . <p> That connected us a little in the moment , enough so that when he came back with the coffee and sweet bread he sat down and joined me . <p> He did n't ask if I minded , and I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " You can recognize a stranger in this town , and not because he is a stranger , " said the man , and took a drink of his coffee even though it looked very hot , with enough steam to look like the hands of a ghost reaching up for him . " It wo n't be the person at all . Not at all . It will be how others in town treat him . " With that he nodded his head , and it seemed to be him though it might as easily been the hands of the ghost making him nod like a puppet . <p> I thought about him sitting down with me so readily . It was , after all , friendly , but a little odd , too . This did n't seem to be what one would do with a stranger , here or anywhere else . He was acting like a friend , and I did n't know why . <p> But why should there be a why , I thought to myself . I should feel good . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " A stranger here , well , this is someone accorded the utmost in civility . Civility and suspicion , with nothing in between , " he laughed . " I think we treat our strangers better than ourselves . " <p> I supposed it was funny , too , and I smiled a little with him . But I was sitting in an awkward chair , and could not decide what to make of him , or of myself . Was I the stranger , or not ? He gave me no time to think . This was perhaps a friendly act , not allowing me the moment it takes for cynicism to build a crust around a conversation , and then between two people . <p> Either he was indeed being friendly , or else in fact I was the stranger , and he was keeping me off-balance . I shrugged my shoulders , finally , to which he nodded his head . It was as if our bodies were themselves talking . <p> " Well , you know , " he said to me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meal , eat it , and be gone . The owner , well  --  you know , the other owners in the other places  --  they instead will offer this person , this stranger , the entire menu , no charge today , and a free tequila to boot . Just like that , no joke . " <p> I looked at him . " A free choice ? On the house ? " Mine were real question marks . <p> " Not just a free choice , my friend . The whole meal . Anything on the menu . " He nodded his head yes . <p> " I do n't understand . " Perhaps , I thought , it was the ghost talking , the ghost of the coffee , all steam . Maybe more than hands had entered and moved him . <p> " The whole menu . How will the owner know what the stranger wants if he does n't offer him everything ? " He looked at me for some sign of common sense , but threw up his hands . Just a little . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up of his hands said what he felt . <p> " Listen , " he continued . " I might offer the stranger simply a pork chop , and offer to cook it any way he pleased , and he would say thank you and eat it with a smile . But in his heart he would still be thinking about the tacos , and he would leave unhappy , even though he is made to smile , because what he really wanted was the tacos . But a free pork chop , how could he pass it up ? And then what will he say to others ? " With that he threw up his hands again , but not in frustration . It was more of a ta-da , there you are , it 's as plain as the nose on your face . <p> I lifted my own eyebrows . <p> " No , my friend , " he said , clearly understanding this conversation enough for the both of us . " No . Strangers can not be trusted . That is why I offer them anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want them to say bad things about me . Who knows what that would mean ? " He nodded his head , not one way or the other , but it moved . <p> " I see , " I said , but I was just being polite . I did n't really see at all . <p> " Well , it is a good thing , then . Take us , for instance . I have n't seen you around here before , but since you understand , now I know I can trust you . So then , will you want some lunch ? It 's not too expensive . I 'll make some tacos . After the sweet breads you do n't want anything too heavy . I ' 11 go make some ? " <p> With that he was gone , and I was left with my cooler coffee . I had n't planned to stay for lunch , but now I was obligated . I was n't sure how I was obligated , exactly , but I was sure that I was . <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew I would like them . <p> " But who does n't , " he said , and went off to serve the others who were now gathering in the restaurant . <p> That seemed to be that . <p> I had come to town to look for family , for ancestors , really , and this man , Don Francisco , as it turns out , would have been a perfect starting point . But what I was doing here never came up . He never quite asked me , and I never quite said . <p> I had thought to tell him in the beginning , when he gave me a chance in the conversation , but then I thought the better of it . He was too good a starting point . I knew he would know . <p> That was the problem . He seemed to know everything , and I was n't sure I liked that . He made it all easy , and it was easy , and should have been easy , but still , when something actually works that way , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain myself in that moment , but that other language was at work between us . It was my body talking . And it never asked Don Francisco about my family . I would ask somebody else . That 's all there was to it , whether I agreed with my body or not . The words just never came out . <p> I should stop for a moment and say that I liked the man , a great deal , and I liked this place . It was all , in its way , perfect . And what went into my mouth in this late morning was more arresting than anything I could bring out . <p> The tacos were fine , crisp with good meat . The salsa , I could taste , was something made today , and fit the taste of the tacos like a meeting of primary colors , a perfect blue and a perfect yellow making a fine green . It was elemental and sure , this taste and this meal , a small alchemy with each bite . <p> Maybe I was just hungry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treble notes of the birds affected me more than I could know , but this food simply tasted sound . Complete . There was nothing else to say . This couch needed no doily . I was tired and I sat down and I felt good . That 's the kind of tacos they were . <p> I had work to do , however , and could not stay here all day . Nothing was making me leave , and I had no real desire to leave , and I suspected I would just be coming back , but I have work to do is just the kind of thing one says , anyway . Who knows why . It was just time to go . <p> Don Francisco had by this time already brought me two Tecates with lime and another coffee . I was enjoying myself too much . That was the thing . <p> " How much do I owe you ? " I asked him as he passed by . He stopped and added something on his fingers . <p> " Eleven dollars , American <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hand to my wallet . Eleven , said my brain , was not too cheap , but neither was it the most I had ever paid . <p> My body echoed , Eleven , but did n't understand one way or the other . It would have paid any amount of money for those two hours of life . But it was my body as well telling me to leave . <p> I pushed my chair out , making that sound of chairs again , but this time it felt right . It was a rhyme sound , so that if the first moment had begun my visit here , then this sound ended it . I paid Don Francisco the eleven dollars , and left another dollar and a half on the table . <p> He said thank you with a nod of his head and I walked out of the restaurant . I thought I was a stranger walking into the place , but it looked like I had to pay for my meal , anyway . On the one hand , that should have made me feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , there was no other hand . Don Francisco was sitting on it . <p> Still , the time had come for doing what I had come to do . I walked into the street to cross it , but I turned and looked back at the restaurant . It was called El Primo . I stood there looking at the sign until a car honked at me and made me jump back onto the sidewalk in front of the restaurant . <p> El Primo . It can mean the first , or the foremost , or anything like that . But it also means the cousin . And in that moment my whole lunch shouted up to me from my stomach . It was not a bad shout , but it was a noise . <p> It was some chemistry , some magnetism . My body knew . If opposites attract , similars repel . This is what my body felt , even if my brain thought otherwise . This is why I felt I had to leave . My body felt the greater thing . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Oh no , I thought , before anything else , but I did n't know why <p> thought that . I just knew it was the right thing to think . The two words rhymed like the pulling out and pushing in of the chair . Oh no and Don Francisco . They were the fitting words all right . Not reasonable , but absolute . Something indeed from magnetism . I should have been happy , of course . Everything in the bar had been wonderful . Don Francisco was a charming host , and , perhaps , along his lines of reasoning , a friend of sorts , already . This was a good day . A good morning turning into a good day . I pulled myself up , took a breath to quiet my lunch , and walked straight back into the place . <p> But my body said Oh no louder . It said the words , and somehow they got stuck in its mouth , like a strand of food in the teeth . <p> There was no reason for the words . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said as I entered , just as easy and as straight as words can be . " Don Francisco . " <p> " My friend , " he said , in just the same manner . We both meant them , but our bodies were shaking their heads . It was n't a shaking side to side in a no , not exactly , but neither was it precisely a yes . It was just a shaking . Maybe it was the ghosts . Our ghosts . <p> " I hope I can indeed count you as my friend , Don Francisco I cleared my throat . " I need your help . " <p> " Whatever I can do , of course : ' he said , very quickly . <p> It was hard for me to believe his answer . It seemed as if he had not had time to digest what he had heard . That he had given his answer just as a reflex , a sus ordenes . At your service . Just like that . The way he would say to anybody . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I asked him just in this way because I did n't know how else to begin . <p> " Well , no , we 're old friends now , are n't we ? And you did pay your bill , after all . We do n't let strangers do that , do we ? " <p> " Don Francisco , please listen . I have something serious to ask . " <p> " Of course you might be that kind of stranger who pays his bill just to throw me off the track . That might be . " He cocked his head . <p> " Don Francisco , I 'm looking for my family . " <p> He raised his arms as if to hug me . " Son ! " <p> He said this , and then started laughing . It made me take a small step backward . <p> But he waved me back toward him . " It 's just that you look so serious , " he said , and stopped the joke . " All right , tell me , then , your family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this I let out my breath , not able to get him to understand because I wanted to say everything at once , but all the words together did not fit through the mouth . I made a small sound instead . But he understood , and he walked me to a near table , pulling out a chair . There was the sound again , but this time almost clean , almost exactly what had come out of me . <p> " I 've come to look for family . Ancestors . Cousins . Anybody . Like that . Do you know what I mean ? " The real words in order sounded anticlimactic . Why was that so difficult to say ? I wondered . And to a stranger , after all . That was the truth of it . <p> " Oh sure , I understand perfectly , " said Don Francisco . " Ancestors . " He pointed to some pictures hung in a corner of the room , toward the end of the counter , along with a picture of the Virgin and John Kennedy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " I have plenty . Do you want some ? " <p> " Don Francisco , listen . I do want some . It 's not a joke . I 've come all the way to find out . My Spanish is maybe not so good , <p> know , but I come from the Calderon family  --  do you know them ? " I looked at him with my eyes , but I could tell that my eyes were already doing their own work . They told him I was serious . Eyes can be used , but they have a mind of their own . <p> " Okay . I understand . I myself am Francisco Rios de Calderon . I know the family as well as I know my mother , God bless her . " <p> " Stop it , Don Francisco , please . " I did n't want him to tease me , not anymore . <p> " It 's true , though . That 's who I am . " <p> " Well , " I said , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family has a Francisco . " <p> " Does n't every family ? " He laughed again in spite of everything . Don Francisco had a helper who must have come to work just in the few minutes I had gone out of the restaurant , and Don Francisco signaled him to bring us some beers . <p> " But I do n't think it 's me you 're looking for . I 'm Rios de Calderon . You 're talking about Francisco Calderon , just like that , on his father 's side , not his mother 's side like me . " <p> " Oh , " I said . It was all I could think of . When the beer came , <p> took a good drink . I noticed , when the helper opened them , a kind of steam came out of the beer , too , like the coffee . A spray , and then a steam , something out of the cold . What is with this place ? I thought . <p> " I was named after him , though . Don Pancho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was so long ago , uncle or cousin , it was something like that . Do you know what I mean ? " Don Francisco took a drink of his own beer . <p> " Would that make us cousins , then ? Or something ? " I had come to the right place , after all . <p> " Well , I count as cousins those who are n't about to ask me for something . " <p> " I just want to know more . That 's all . " <p> " They all say that , my friend . I would have thought the less of you if you did not lie to me a little , like that . I think you have just been promoted . But all right . I ' 11 tell you something . <p> " The chairs and tables outside . They 're from my house when I was growing up . Your grandmother and grandfather sat in them . Your nana and tata . In fact , it was your nana 's hairnet , the one she always wore after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to do in the garden outside . " <p> With that he began to talk a little faster . It was the beer , the good coldness of the beer , or me , or the remembering of the detail  --  whatever it was , it made him talk faster . I could n't follow everything , but when I was stuck he put his hand on my arm and got a big smile on his face . It was okay . <p> " And the salsa , did you like it ? That was hers . I learned it from her . She used to make it many years ago when I first opened this place . " <p> " Yes , wonderful , Don Francisco , it 's wonderful . What else can you tell me ? " I really was smiling . Something was letting go , something I could feel . <p> Don Francisco said a few more things , pointing to an old hatrack and some curtains . Then we got up to look at the pictures . <p> " She was beautiful , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't have any pictures of the senor here , " he said . " But maybe tonight we 'll find one . " <p> I looked at the picture . She was beautiful , despite the wan curtain used as background . I had seen enough of these pictures by now to recognize how the photographers would use anything as backdrop , regardless of its condition . What mattered was the subject , of course . And there she was , in a jet-satin hat and some lipstick , which had been colored in . <p> " That 's not her , " I said . <p> Don Francisco looked at me . " What do you mean ? Look again . Maybe you 've seen some other pictures of her and she just looks different here . That 's it . Look in this light over here , " he said , and took the picture off its hanger to hold it up to the window . <p> " No , it 's not I looked at it for a long time . There was no question . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don Francisco . He looked at me hard , with edges . He did n't want to look at me that way , I could tell , but his eyes were doing what they wanted and his bones at the joints of his elbows flexed to a point . <p> " No , no , Don Francisco . I did n't trick you . This just is n't her . " And it was n't . Maybe I had explained myself badly , awkwardly , with the wrong words . But it was n't her . We both could see that now . <p> ... <p> " But you made me remember her . You made me tell you . What is this all about ? Who are you ? " He sat back in his chair and tried to fold his arms , but they fell out of their own knot , and fell a little into his lap . They , too , were doing their own work . They were telling the truth . <p> As was Don Francisco . But so was I. I told him everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it was n't right . It was close for a long time , but it was n't right . <p> We talked a little more , and I shrugged my shoulders . I had n't meant to upset this man who had been only kind to me . Who could have suspected he would feel this way ? Don Francisco kept shaking his head a little in a no . He did n't say the word , but it 's what he meant . He had given something away , or had let me see , something that was not mine . <p> He pointed me to the church . " That 's where the records are , " he said . " And over there is the cemetery . Good luck . " He wished me good luck , and he meant the words , but it was with a tempered spirit . <p> I should have been the one to feel that way , and I did . But he felt it so much that it crowded into me , until I was feeling him feeling this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was something much bigger , and spelled much smaller . It was a real feeling more than a word . <p> We parted at the door to the restaurant . Afternoon had come and was honking to take me away like a taxi . The bright afternoon light is sometimes like that , especially when you want to be back inside taking a nap in the home of a friend . In the home of a cousin , just for the afternoon . <p> " Strangers , " said Don Francisco as one of his last words , but he said the word more with his larger eye , which sometimes not only has a mind but a voice . He said it and then he gave a laugh . But it was only half a laugh . I wanted to make up the difference , but <p> could n't . <p> " Well , you 've been the best stranger , anyway , " he said . " I played a joke on you , and you played a joke on me . Even ? " It was not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of the day . With that he shook my hand . <p> " I 'll see you , " I said , but realized that these words might not be true . Maybe he was right , I thought , about believing strangers . He was right about everything else . What had I done to him ? <p> I did n't know why he got so upset . I thought it was a small thing , the asking of a question and the giving of an answer , but I was wrong . I was wrong this time . <p> Maybe it was something in my Spanish , in the way I said or understood words . Some things do n't travel well between languages . But perhaps it was simpler . Maybe it was just a gauge of meaning , so much about how he had loved this woman , and how he missed her , and tried to keep her in all of her ways . <p> Maybe it was as simple as that . The feeling belonged to him . And for a moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of things . <p> I did n't know if I was a stranger or a friend , finally . Or what he was to me . Even though all the names were true for both of us , he was n't finally my cousin , if you believed the church . <p> I did n't say anything else as we parted , of course . Just a small wave goodbye . I do n't know if it was enough . <p>
