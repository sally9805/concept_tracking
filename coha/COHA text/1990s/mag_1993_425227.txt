<p> You do n't have taxpayer-subsidized workers to help you keep your job . So your congressman ? <p> When Texas Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison was indicted last month for using state employees to make campaign fund-raising calls and using a state computer to keep track of contributions , there had to be a few quickened pulses on Capitol Hill . After all , Washington incumbents are accustomed to using their offices for partisan work . <p> Consider : Two weeks before last fall 's election , retiring Rep. Glenn Anderson dispatched five congressional aides to California where they campaigned for Anderson 's chosen successor , Evan Braude , his stepson , at taxpayers ' expense . Rep. Les AuCoin , running hard for Oregon 's Senate seat , flew eight Hill aides out last fall for a total of 189 days . Taxpayers paid their salaries and airfares because they frequently worked days in AuCoin 's district office , says former aide Bob Crane . Nights , weekends , vacations , and comp time they spent campaigning for AuCoin . Rep. John Conyers , chairman of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them both , enlisting 14 members of his staff in one way or another in his Detroit reelection campaign . Among the aides ' taxpayer-paid " official representational duties " was handing out thousands of Conyers ' press releases at shopping centers and churches shortly before election day . <p> Overall , at least 70 incumbents summoned two or more federally-paid Washington aides to their districts late in their campaigns , House expense records indicate . Typically , lawmakers claimed , " official business " required their aides ' presence . Just as typically , that business ended on election day . Aides who are skilled political fighters and whose futures are riding on their bosses ' reelection are one big reason that incumbents won 93 percent of the races they entered last fall , down just slightly from their 95 percent rate in the eighties . " They 're part of the permanent campaign , right along with franking . It 's a terrible , terrible abuse , " says Sara Fritz , a Los Angeles Times political finance analyst and co-author of The Handbook of Campaign Spending . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep their jobs , and it 's unclear why congressmen should be an exception . But pending campaign reforms do not address campaigning by aides or a second widespread abuse among incumbents seeking reelection : the use of franked mail as a campaign tool . Fund raising aside , those are the two key advantages most frequently exploited by incumbents in their campaigns . The only restraints on incumbent House campaigners  --  who are generally considered more audacious than their Senate counterparts  --  is the tough-sounding but toothless House Ethics Manual . <p> The 493-page guide bars incumbents from using government funds to campaign . But there 's a catch : Almost anything is admissable when it 's billed as " constituent service . " The manual also permits aides to campaign only on their own time . But there 's a catch here , too : Lawmakers decide when the workday is done , when aides have earned comp time , and when they can take vacations . <p> " After Congress lets out in mid-October , it 's amazing how many staffers show up in the district hammering in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former press aide to Rep. Bob McEwen of Ohio , a member who lost last fall . " It 's wrong , but incumbents have an incredible , unfair advantage . " Among Broughton 's most important assignments last summer , he recalls , was creating a newsletter lauding the boss , who faced a tough primary battle . " It was nothing but glorifying the incumbent , but we disguised it as informing constituents and sent out hundreds of thousands of copies as franked mail , " says Broughton . <p> The ethics manual notes that incumbents can not use their frank for mass mailings within 60 days of a primary or general election . But that does n't curb campaigners ' use of the frank so much as channel it . In the final week before the deadline last year , pallets of " official communications " awaiting pick-up by postal workers made the corridors outside the House printer virtually impassable . Elections just after redistricting , like the last one , also lay bare the , timeless ruse that franked mass mailings are non-political communications with constituents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected the member , but to those in the new district whom lawmakers sought to impress . That 's fine by the obliging House Ethics committee , so long as some portion of the old district is included in the new district . Frank Incensed <p> Most aides are mum or vague about campaign work , but when McEwen 's troops vacated their House office , they left some tell-tale clues behind on the office computer . The documents disclosed by his successor , Ted Strickland , began to show how aides helped McEwen without ever leaving the federal payroll . <p> A press release , for example , begins : " ' Ted Strickland 's got a lot of nerve , ' campaign manager Barbara Briggs said after more bogus charges from the perennial candidate . " Briggs title and her tirade may have made her sound like a campaign staffer , but House financial records indicate that she was on McEwen 's congressional payroll at the time , earning $43,000 . <p> The ethics manual requires that campaign work " Be kept out of the congressional office . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the campaign and official duties is okay , if the boss approves and clear distinctions are maintained on timesheets . Federal Election Commission ( FEC ) records indicate Briggs earned an additional $11,937 salary from McEwen 's campaign while serving on his staff . She says she has " no idea " how much time she actually spent on official versus campaign work . <p> Another aide , William Pascoe III , earned $40,000 as McEwen 's chief of staff while soliciting contributions for McEwen in his spare time . Some of the memos on the office computer were his , Pascoe acknowledges . " But I did them at home , on my computer . " Fund raising for the boss is okay too , as the ethics manual says , as long as aides do it on their own time , outside federal facilities . McEwen declined comment on his campaigning aides , unless he could speak off the record . <p> A half dozen such talented volunteers can easily be worth $100,000 to an incumbent , based on the cost of political consultants of comparable talent . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on average , $197,000 last year , according to the FEC . <p> For challengers , an incumbent 's campaigning aides are likely to be stealthy , as well as potent , forces . " Clearly , a good number of his staff were working on his reelection , " recalls Republican Dennis Shea , who lost to incumbent Rep. Thomas Manton of New York last fall . " But only Inspector Clouseau could tell whether they were working on official time or their own time . " ( Steven Vest , an aide to Manton , says staffers did not campaign while receiving federal pay . ) <p> Though some aides are skittish on the subject , it 's clear that pounding the pavement for the boss during election time is now part of Capitol Hill culture . To David Coggin , top aide to California 's Rep. Ron Packard , getting his boss reelected is simply part of the job . " I 'm the third chief of staff here , and with all of us it 's been the same  --  you take your vacation and run the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consultant on top of his $94,000 congressional salary . <p> Other aides volunteered and were rewarded with promotions , raises , or bonuses once their bosses were reelected . Two top Republicans , for example , House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia and Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska , repaid campaigning staffers with year-end cash gifts in 1990 . Stevens used campaign funds ; Gingrich , government funds . <p> Because publication of House office expense records lags three months or longer behind outlays , it 's impossible for challengers  --  or reporters  --  to learn during a campaign 's heat whether aides remain on the federal payroll . The ethics manual states that they " should keep careful records documenting that campaign work was not done on official time . " But many do n't , and some lawmakers , like Conyers , refuse to disclose what leave or vacation time aides took for campaign work . <p> For instance , two aides to the delegate from American Samoa even flew to Pago Pago at government expense for the 1992 campaign 's last 20 days . Did they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really . We took annual leave and we campaigned , " one of the aides , Aliimau H. Scanlan , Jr . initially replied . But , Scanlan was reminded , their $2,300 in air fares was justified as " official business . " " Oh , I forgot , " Scanlan said after a pause . " I made an earlier trip out in August and we campaigned . " He declined to produce those travel records , however . <p> Seem outrageous ? Fact is , the rules are so lax that aides have to fudge them much more blatantly than Scanlan to make any trouble for themselves . The only lawmaker who may have run afoul of campaigning rules is retired Rep. Anderson , whose staff helped his stepson , Evan Braude , in a close loss . According to Braude , the FBI is investigating whether his stepfather  --  but not Braude  --  misused government resources . Although the Justice Department rarely and reluctantly intervenes in legislative matters , lawmakers can be charged with fraud if they " compensate individuals from public monies for campaign services . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a campaign adviser to her son ; she insists aides campaigned on their own time . <p> The House Ethics committee does n't care . Only seated members fall within its jurisdiction , meaning that its rules apply only to winners . When exploiting free campaign help , it seems , incumbents just ca n't lose . <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> BY FRANK GREVE <p> <p> Frank Greve is a national correspondent for Knight-Ridder . <p>
