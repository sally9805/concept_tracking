Promising cancer drug may hide a troubling dark side <p> In January , an international team of researchers published a huge analysis of the success of various postsurgical , or adjuvant , therapies for breast cancer . Drawing on 133 randomized trials from around the world , their data identified tamoxifen  --  a synthetic hormone  --  as the ascendant star . <p> Unlike standard chemotherapeutic agents  --  which kill dividing cells throughout the body , not just in the cancer  --  tamoxifen kills nothing . It routs cancers by starving them of the estrogen that can promote their growth . <p> Hailed as nothing less than a wonder drug , tamoxifen has proved so successful in stalling or preventing breast cancer recurrence that researchers in the United States stand poised to begin large-scale trials of the drug this week in healthy women at high risk of the disease . A related trial could begin any day in the United Kingdom , with others slated in Europe and Australia . Their goal : prevention of breast cancer  --  the most common malignancy in women . <p> New toxicological studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These findings are seeding doubts about the wisdom of administering the potent anti-estrogenic drug for years  --  perhaps for life  --  to healthy women . <p> The new data have already held up the U.K. cancer-prevention trial involving tamoxifen . On March 12 , as the study 's leaders planned to begin recruiting an estimated 13,000 additional volunteers for a scaled-up five-year program , Britain 's Medical Research Council ( MRC ) withdrew its support for the study as currently designed , pending further toxicological studies . The two remaining sponsors  --  the Imperial Cancer Research Fund and the Cancer Research Campaign  --  decided to continue the trial on their own , provided the U.K. 's Department of Health approves . At press time , that agency was taking a second look at the study design . <p> A U.S. tamoxifen trial for breast cancer prevention , funded by the National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) , remains on track . NCI has scheduled a press conference for April 29 to announce details of this study , slated to eventually involve 16,000 healthy , high-risk women age 35 and over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRC Secretary Dai A. Rees explained his agency 's decision to withdraw from the U.K. study in the March 28 BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL . Unpublished data by tamoxifen 's manufacturer indicate that the drug induces liver tumors in rats , he notes . Because of the way it accumulates in the human body , doses of the drug responsible for producing cancers in rats appear " similar to those to be used in the trial , " Rees says . As a result , " there is no dose or safety margin . " <p> Rees also cites a study reported in the March I CANCER RESEARCH showing that tamoxifen produces potentially carcinogenic DNA alterations  --  known as adducts  --  in the livers of at least two types of rodents . Finally , though researchers have studied tamoxifen 's effects in thousands of women , few of those patients have received the drug for more than five to seven years ; that 's less time than it usually takes for carcinogens to induce liver tumors in humans , Rees notes . <p> Worldwide , breast cancer rates are increasing ( SN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will strike one in nine U.S. and Canadian women sometime during their lives , kills almost 45,000 each year in the United States alone . <p> MRC " has no wish to spread alarm among women taking tamoxifen for proved breast cancer , " Rees says ; for them , tamoxifen " is a well-tried and effective treatment " ( see sidebar ) . However , until potentially life-threatening side effects can be ruled out , he says , MRC can not justify administering this drug , as planned , to healthy women under age 40 . <p> But not all researchers regard the new animal data as particularly revealing about tamoxifen 's threat to humans . " Rat experiments seem to be the first stage , used to try to decide whether to use a drug or not , " says Richard Peto , director of the cancer studies unit at Oxford University in England . " But once you 've tried it for several years in tens of thousands of women , why not just look at what you see there ? And with tamoxifen , what you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Oncologists and surgeons designed the tamoxifen cancer-prevention trials , points out Adriane Fugh-Berman , a physician in Washington , D.C. " And to them , " she says , " tamoxifen is like a vitamin  --  it 's the least toxic oncology drug they deal with . <p> " But those of us in preventive health and medicine have different standards about what kinds of things you should unleash onto a healthy population , " she maintains . Ideally , she says , programs targeted at healthy , at-risk people " should be extremely safe  --  preferably health promoting . And if not health promoting , at least nontoxic . " <p> Several researchers , including Peto , argue that tamoxifen is just that  --  relatively nontoxic and health promoting . In older women diagnosed with breast cancer , tamoxifen reduces cholesterol levels in the blood by about 20 percent , increases bone density and appears to prevent new primary cancers in the other breast . On the positive side of the risk-benefit equation , he concludes , the drug not only prevents breast cancers , but also reduces the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few studies have indicated an increased risk of endometrial cancer among women on tamoxifen . There is also " compelling evidence " that the drug 's active metabolite in the body  --  4-hydroxytamoxifen  --  stimulates the growth of human endometrial cancer cells grown in culture , notes Liam J. Murphy of the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg . <p> In the April 1 CANCER RESEARCH , he and his co-workers report finding that " this growth-stimulatory effect was observed at very low concentrations . . . and was specific to tamoxifen , since the other anti-estrogens tested did not stimulate cancer-cell proliferation . " These data certainly suggest that tamoxifen might pose a cancer risk to women in the upcoming prophylactic trials , Murphy told SCIENCE NEWS . <p> However , Peto notes , caught early , endometrial cancer seldom kills . As such , he asserts , " it 's no big deal . " <p> Fugh-Berman reaches a different conclusion . " It really freezes my blood when people say endometrial cancer is not a bad cancer , " she says . " The treatment for it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big deal to lose your uterus . " Moreover , she says , " the way you detect it is by endometrial biopsy , which not everybody will be willing to undergo annually ; they 're quite painful . " She also cites evidence that tamoxifen can increase a woman 's risk of thrombophlebitis , which can lead to life-threatening pulmonary embolisms . " We 're afraid these tamoxifen intervention trials are really going to set a precedent for experiments in disease substitution  --  a concept we do n't like , " she told SCIENCE NEWS . Until the drug 's long-term safety has been established , she says , the National Women 's Health Network , of which she is a board member , will object to tamoxifen 's use in healthy populations . At a minimum , she 'd like to see the drug 's ambiguous liver cancer status resolved . <p> So would Lars E. Rutqvist , an oncologist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm , Sweden . To date , his team remains the only one to report evidence of a possible increased risk of liver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21,1989 LANCET , Rutqvist and his co-workers reported finding two primary liver cancers among women taking tamoxifen in a randomized Swedish trial  --  an incidence four times the expected rate . <p> Why have no other researchers turned up similar cancers ? " This is really puzzling , " Rutqvist says , because other studies have n't even observed what has been the normal incidence of this relatively rare malignancy . <p> Fugh-Berman has one idea : Clinicians ca n't find what they do n't look for . " There are a lot of women who take tamoxifen for breast cancer , but they 're not routinely autopsied . " And even if doctors detect a mass on the liver , she says , " some clinicians may call it a metastasis spawned by the original breast cancer . They should be biopsying it to determine whether it 's really a second and unrelated primary cancer caused by the tamoxifen . " <p> Gary M. Williams , medical director of the American Health Foundation in Valhalla , N.Y. , shares her view . " I 've specifically asked clinicians if a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work her up to see if it is a liver cancer versus a metastasis from the breast , " he says . " And the answer has always been , No . We assume it 's a metastasis . ' " With that attitude , he says , " no one knows what the incidence is of liver cancers in tamoxifen users . " <p> But there is growing reason to worry , many scientists believe . For instance , a paper in the Nov. 15 , 1991 CANCER RESEARCH showed that in the livers of rodents , tamoxifen produces metabolites that react very strongly with proteins . " We do n't yet know what this reactive metabolite of tamoxifen is , but we know it binds irreversibly , " says study coauthor David Kupfer of the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology in Shrewsbury , Mass . These data , adds Williams , suggest that " tamoxifen is being handled in the liver like a chemical carcinogen , not like a hormone . " <p> A growing body of toxicological research suggests that most chemical carcinogens cause their damage by binding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 CANCER RESEARCH , chemists at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston report finding novel DNA adducts in the livers of rats and hamsters fed tamoxifen . <p> Ordinarily , the body can repair much , if not all , of this type of damage . What proved startling , recalls Joachim G. Liehr , who led the study , " was not that the tamoxifen causes DNA damage  --  many drugs do  --  but that with repeated administrations of the drug we seem to get fairly little repair . " After all , he notes , " tamoxifen is being touted as a safe ' drug that can be taken for many years with few side effects . Because of this reputation , I expected to see little DNA damage . In fact , we found a lot . " <p> Liehr was also surprised to find that he could not prevent the formation of DNA adducts in the liver by administering either vitamin C or another chemical to the animals . In previous trials with a related anti-estrogenic drug  --  diethylstilbestrol ( DES )  --  both treatments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " may make this drug a poor choice for the chronic preventive treatment of breast cancer , " Liehr and his coauthor , Xueliang Han , conclude . <p> But Leslie G. Ford , chief of community oncology and rehabilitation for NCI , argues that " it 's misleading to say adducts mean DNA damage because there 's no evidence that they have been incorporated into the genome . " <p> While Williams agrees that there is no direct evidence , he says a pair of unpublished , just-completed studies appear to offer indirect evidence of the adducts ' carcinogenicity . <p> Having himself demonstrated DES ' ability to induce liver tumors in animals , Williams decided to investigate a structural analog  --  tamoxifen  --  and toremifene , another anti-estrogenic breast cancer drug . <p> Unlike toremifene , which produced no tumors , tamoxifen proved to be " a rip-roaring liver carcinogen , " Williams says . At the higher doses studied , within one year it produced cancers in 100 percent of the treated animals , something he describes as " an astonishing effect . " <p> " These are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is the strongest liver cancer effect that I have seen with a chemical carcinogen . " <p> The natural expectation , he recalls , was that any carcinogenic effect from tamoxifen would trace to the drug 's binding to estrogen receptors . But when toremifene , which binds to those same receptors , produced no cancers , " we became perplexed . " Then along came Liehr 's paper . " I now think it provides a very convincing explanation for the induction of our tumors , " Williams says . <p> He also conducted a lower-dose experiment in which animals received just 10 times the tamoxifen dose typically administered to women . " And in one year , we got precancerous lesions , " Williams says . Rutqvist reports that representatives of a Finnish pharmaceutical firm told him they also have produced precancerous liver changes  --  called hyperplasic nodules  --  in nearly 100 percent of their tamoxifen-treated animals . Rutqvist is now considering looking for evidence of similar precancerous changes in autopsy tissues obtained from Swedish women who had taken tamoxifen . <p> Nor are endometrial and liver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Some small percentage of breast cancers do not appear dependent upon hormones for their growth . In the Jan. 1 CANCER RESEARCH , Karin C. Fendl and Stephen J. Zimniski of the University of Miami School of Medicine report finding that tamoxifen-treated animals , compared with animals given no treatment , had an excess of these hormone-independent malignancies  --  aggressive cancers that are very resistant to treatment . <p> The Miami team used the classic animal model for human breast cancer : Rats fed the carcinogen dimethylbenzanthracene ( DMBA ) once a week for four weeks develop palpable mammary tumors just under the skin . <p> Nine weeks into one experiment , the researchers began administering I milligram of tamoxifen per kilogram of body weight to half of their animals . After three weeks , 70 to 90 percent of the DMBA-induced tumors had shrunk in size . In a second trial , where DMBA and tamoxifen were administered together for four weeks , animals receiving the combo treatment developed far fewer breast cancers than rats receiving DMBA alone . <p> That 's the good news . The bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumor that appeared in a tamoxifen-treated animal was subsequently found to be hormone-independent , " the Miami researchers report . A small percentage of the breast tumors in rats administered DMBA alone also proved hormone-independent . However , hormone-independent tumors grew three times faster in the tamoxifen-treated animals  --  " doubling in size daily , " notes Zimniski , now at the University of Kansas ' Women 's Research Institute in Wichita . " We 've never seen tumors grow that fast . " <p> How does that translate to women ? <p> A few weeks ago , Rutqvist says , " the first data came out of our computer suggesting that women with hormone-independent tumors do worse when they receive tamoxifen than when they do n't . " The findings come from a very small subgroup  --  about 350 of the roughly 1,800 postmenopausal women he 's studying . <p> " We do n't know whether the finding is due to chance , " he says . " But clearly , we 'll be observing this group closely to see whether the trend continues with increasing follow-up . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gastrointestinal cancer among tamoxifen users . Ordinarily , he says , he probably would not pay much attention to such a trend  --  except that another Swedish study and a Danish trial have identified signs of a similar small increase in gastrointestinal cancer among women receiving tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy for breast cancer . <p> Overall , Rutqvist finds a small increased risk of cancer in women receiving tamoxifen : Roughly 8 percent develop new , primary cancers of all kinds , compared with about 5 percent among the controls ( postsurgical patients receiving no hormonal therapy ) . He plans to report these findings in May at a meeting of the American Society for Clinical Oncology . <p> Rutqvist 's group has conducted one of the longest tamoxifen trials . Women in this ongoing program , which began in 1976 , receive 40 mg of the drug daily . <p> Seven years ago , researchers at the Royal Marsden Hospital ( in London and Sutton ) began quite a different long-term tamoxifen trial  --  this one directed at assessing whether researchers could learn anything from giving 20-mg prophylactic doses daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall risk of breast cancer  --  have entered their study so far . Another 10 to 15 recruits join the program each week . <p> Among the women receiving tamoxifen in this trial , " we 've not seen any evidence of an increased risk of second cancers , " says Trevor J. Powles , one of the study 's leaders . However , he acknowledges , " it 's arguable that it 's still too early " to see such an effect . <p> Powles is not particularly worried about the new animal data . " I find it remarkable that people are still looking at rat data , which are generally irrelevant anyway , " he says . " I think the human data now are the critical factor . " <p> Adds NCI 's Ford : " We 've known about liver cancer in rats for many , many years . The new toxicological studies really do n't add anything new to that . " <p> Moreover , she says , the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project  --  the network of more than 200 research centers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer-prevention trial involving tamoxifen  --  " went to the world 's experts on determining breast cancer risk . " <p> The resulting risk-benefit analysis indicated that the U.S. trial might carry some low risk of fostering endometrial cancers  --  and even liver cancers , acknowledges Ford , who will oversee the new trial for NCI . But after weighing these risks , the Food and Drug Administration determined that on balance the U.S. trial " still looks like it 's worth doing "  --  and indeed is something it " felt comfortable with , " she says . <p> What 's more , prospective recruits will be informed of the potential risks associated with entering the study . Indeed , Ford says , " I want to go on record saying this is probably one of the most comprehensive informed-consents we 've ever seen . Every comment that FDA made was taken into account . " <p> Drug therapy to head off breast cancer in high-risk but healthy women " is a different type of clinical trial than anything that 's been done before  --  certainly in cancer , " Powles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets underway , another 13,000 women will join those being studied at Royal Marsden . Powles ' hope : to cut the risk of breast cancer in these women by half , maybe more . <p> " We have an opportunity to prevent breast cancer , certainly by a substantial amount . No one can tell me we can do that without taking a few chances , " Powles concedes . " But I do n't think we could have gone into this more cautiously than we have . . . and I do n't think we 'll ever get anything better . " <p> By Janet Raloff <p>
