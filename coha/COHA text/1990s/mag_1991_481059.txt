Anthony Vincent , " a Nevada casino operator seeking the legalization of gambling in Arizona . From January 1 , 1990 , to January 31 , 1991 , Stedino played the central role in an undercover sting operation by the Phoenix police and the Maricopa County Attorney 's Office to investigate corruption among Arizona state legislators ; he was paid $42,000 a year far his undercover work . As " Vincent , " Stedino established a network of lobbyists and legislators to oversee the passage of the pro-gambling legislation . In February sixteen people involved in the scheme , including seven state legislators , were indicted ; Meredith , charged with accepting bribes , money laundering , and violating campaign-finance laws , was among them . The transcript of this meeting , which took place in Vincent 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government 's indictment . Although his lawyers asserted in February that Meredith 's actions during the October 4 meeting were " part of the traditional job of a majority leader . . land ) the way government works , " Meredith resigned his seat and pleaded guilty to a reduced charge in March . J. ANTHONY VINCENT " : Jim , Fin not going to kid you . Of the people that I 've sat with ' cause I told you the other day , I 've been very selective and discreet about who I sit with ? you 're probably the most important person , based on your leadership seat . And I would hate to see you lose that . REPRESENTATIVE JIM MEREDITH : Yeah . VINCENT : I mean , if I am fortunate enough to have a majority leader in the House that 's saying , Hey , I can vote yes on this issue with no problem , then I know that my bill is not going to get shelved . REP . MEREDITH : Mmm-hmm . VINCENT : That 's an important guy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , let 's just tell it like it is . Having a friend in that position ? if 1 may be , you know , liberal enough to call you a friend at this point ? that is paramount to me . REP . MEREDITH : Mmm-hmm . VINCENT : The green lights yes votes are important , but to think that the majority leader has the power to shelve my bill for ten years ? REP . MEREDITH : That 's true . VINCENT : It 's frightening . REP . MEREDITH : Yeah . VINCENT : And , see , I come from a state where things are done ( snaps fingers ) quickly . Don Kenney , the Arizona representative who introduced Meredith and Vincent knows some of the people that I 'm affiliated with over there . I think he mentioned Harry Reid to you , who 's a United States senator now . I mean , Christ , I can call Harry and talk to him the way I would talk to a Dutch uncle . REP . MEREDITH : Sure . VINCENT : But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it started off the way our friendship started off . REP . MEREDITH : Mmm-hmm . VINCENT : He was with the Gaming Commission , and we had lunch one day , and I needed some things , he needed some things , and everything came together and you have a friendship . REP MEREDITH : Yeah . VINCENT : That nurtures and grows . REP . MEREDITH : Mmm-hmm . VINCENT : And , uh , what do you see as a possible threat to you that could cause you to lose that leadership position ? REP . MEREDITH : Well , the worst-case scenario is that as many as eighteen Republican representatives that I call ultraconservative would go against my leadership only because I 'm not conservative enough . The House majority leader is elected by the members of his party 's caucus . VINCENT : But , Jim , as far as you and I ? REP . MEREDITH : I 'm not worried about that . VINCENT : All I would ask is that I have your promise that you 'll vote yes on my issue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Yeah , I wo n't shelve it . It 'll go . As long as you 've got the votes it 'll go . VINCENT : But you got ta vote also . REP . MEREDITH : Oh yeah , I got ta vote . VINCENT : Um , all right , Jim , if you 're going to help me , then I want to help you , It 's important to me . I want to help you any way I can , and I want you to keep your leadership position . That 's the bottom line . REP . MEREDITH : Mmm-hmm . VINCENT : You know , that 's the way it is . I wish I could tell you that my heart and soul belong to Arizona , but this is a billion-dollar industry . REP . MEREDITH : Mmm-hmm . VINCENT : I 'm not saying I 'm the messiah and I have all the answers for this state , but I sure as hell can tell you that within a five-year period of the legislation being passed , you 're looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MEREDITH : Mmm-hmm . Mmm-hmm . VINCENT : So tell me how I can help you and what I can do for Jim Meredith that 's going to make Jim happy and maintain his seat , because that 's what I want to do . REP . MEREDITH : Mmm-hmm . Well , we need to support some Republicans candidates who , if elected , would vote for Meredith for majority leader . VINCENT : Okay . I have your list here , by the way . Reading Mike Gilbert . REP . MEREDITH : Yeah , he needs money . VINCENT : Okay . REP . MEREDITI I : That 's where I just came from , meeting with Mike , and I told him that I 'd get some outside money . He 's one of my supporters , and he 's one that I need in there . VINCENT : All right ? John Greene . REP . MEREDITH : Just put him down as a supporter ; he does n't need any money . VINCENT : Okay . They discuss other candidates on Meredith 's VINCENT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your leadership position , correct ? REP . MEREDITH : That 's why I 'm helping them . We need to get them elected . VINCENT : Okay , what else ? Or who else ? REP . MEREDITH : Fife Symington the Republican candidate for governor . Why could n't you go to this thing a fund-raising dinner for Symington ' ? VINCENT : Oh , I want to go , yeah . I told you I wanted to go . REP . MEREDITH : Sit at my table , and that 'll give you a chance to get to know Fife . VINCENT : How many of these tickets do you need me to buy ? REP . MEREDITH : It 's your call . VINCENT : Would it help you if I took four ? REP . MEREDITH : Absolutely . Absolutely . VINCENT : You want the name of the person that 's going to he with me ? REP . MEREDITH : Yes , that 's what I need . VINCENT : It 's going to be me and Shiree Foster a staff assistant at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shiree ? That 's a different name . VINCENT : So that comes to what , uh , $2,200 . He hands Meredith $2,200 in cash . REP . MEREDITH : Do n't you have a checkbook ? It 's always money ? VINCENT : See if there 's twenty-two there . REP . MEREDITH : Do n't you have a checkbook ? Jesus Christ . I 'm running around with $2,200 . VINCENT : Jim , please , try to understand the way I live . I live in a different world . I carry $20,000 or $30,000 at all times . I 'm sorry . I ca n't help that . That 's just the way I live . ( Meredith laughs . ) VINCENT : It 's just my style . REP . MEREDITH : Mmm-hmm . VINCENT : Where 's my tickets ?

At least Fife will know that I cared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MEREDITH : Mmm-hmm . ( Laughs ) That 's right . VINCENT : So now back to Jim Meredith and what we can do to help Jim Meredith maintain his leadership seat and get these people on your side . What do we need to do ? REP . MEREDITH : Well , as far as myself , I 'm fine Meredith was running unopposed in his district . I just need to get money to help my Republicans . VINCENT : Now , I do n't have any problem with that at all . I mean , it 's ? it 's ? I have a slight problem . The money is n't the problem . REP . MEREDITH : All right . VINCENT : Uh ? ( laughs ) . This is embarrassing , but it 's true . This is where you and I have to come to what we call in Italian a " little marriage . " ( Meredith laughs . ) VINCENT : Urn ? I 'm maxed out .

The oilers in the show are from the collection of Robert and Louise Coates of Deerfield , Wisconsin . VINCENT : I 'm maxed out . REP . MEREDITH : What about using , uh , Shiree 's name ? VINCENT : Fine . REP . MEREDITH : Why do n't we do that ? VINCENT : Okay . REP . MEREDITH : Yeah , this is what everybody is having to do .

MEREDITH : He should be able to get through on that . VINCENT : Four forty , Gary Richardson . Phone rings . Vincent answers . Hi , Shiree . How you doing ? Listen , you have n't given any money to any political candidates , have you ? Okay . So you do n't have a problem with giving $880 to a polititian ? All right . Good .
