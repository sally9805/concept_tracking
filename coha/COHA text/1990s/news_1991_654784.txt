<p> AMERICA 'S appetite for fresh fruits and vegetables keeps right on growing - as does the availability of new varieties of fresh produce . <p> Americans ate 102 pounds of fresh vegetables per capita in 1989 , up from 72 pounds in 1970 , says Bill O'Neil , spokesman for The Packer , a trade publication . In 1970 , Americans ate 79.5 lbs . of fresh fruit apiece , compared with 96.5 lbs . in 1989 , a figure growers expect will double by the year 2000 . <p> On display at last week 's United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association convention and exposition here was some more encouragement : a dozen or more new kinds of lettuces ( including mache , frissee , baby red mustard , baby red oak , baby green oak , and baby romaine ) , a handful of new mushrooms , and more than a dozen new squashes , along with fresh herbs , more Asian foods , and even what one company calls Slim Line vegetables ( from mini-carrots and onions to leeks and cactus leaves ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce to packaging materials and harvesting equipment . There were gorgeous fresh fruits and vegetables in abundance . <p> Forecasters at various workshops spoke about trends in convenience , consumption , and marketing : Miniature produce shows promise , say observers . " Baby " vegetables are gaining familiarity with consumers , who are buying more of them . Watch for smaller heads of lettuce , and smaller melons . Pitless cherries , oranges sold pre-peeled , seedless watermelons , and fast-cooking potatoes are also on the horizon . <p> Asian appetite is biggest <p> Experts also see room to expand in terms of consumption . Americans may be eating more fresh produce , but they have barely sat down at the table compared to other parts of the world . Canadians eat 500 lbs . of fresh produce per capita per year . The figure for Western Europe is 600 lbs. , and Asians eat some 700 lbs . of fresh produce annually , according to Mr. O'Neil . <p> Convenience is still a top priority , with 48 percent of households favoring quick foods , in a survey reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there will be greater availability of pre-cut , pre-trimmed , pre-diced fruits and vegetables such as sticks of carrots and celery , sliced mushrooms , flowerets of broccoli and cauliflower , slices of melon , chunks of fruit , and sliced pineapple in a bag . A salad mix and a chop suey mix are already on the market . The latter contains celery , napa cabbage , bok choy , and carrots ready to stir fry . <p> Exotic produce was popular during the booming 1980s , but how will it fare in a recession ? Karen Caplan , president of Frieda 's Inc. , America 's premier marketer and distributor of specialty produce , says there is still a prominent place for such foods . <p> " In a recession , when consumers are hesitant to buy new homes and expensive cars and are eating out less , we 'll be looking for ways to pamper ourselves at home , " she says . " People want a continuing variety in fruits and vegetables for cooking at home . <p> " Americans are very savvy today , " Ms. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasted new foods . They 're willing to try them at home but they want them in the supermarkets so they wo n't need to go to ethnic neighborhoods to find them . " <p> Frieda 's , begun in 1962 by Caplan 's mother , was a pioneer in the specialty produce business . <p> " Although my mother has introduced many new products , her first and greatest discovery was with kiwi fruit which she introduced single handedly to the world " in the early ' 60s , says Caplan : <p> " It was not easy trying to sell the strange , brown , fuzzy fruit with the name ' Chinese gooseberry . ' But my mother had 240 flats of the fruit to sell . She learned that cutting the fruit in half , showing the bright green center , made it appealing . Then she sent her profits back to New Zealand and asked them to provide material with recipes and uses of the product for the shoppers .

Leaflets tell how to prepare vegetables for Oriental cooking , how to choose mushrooms such as dried cepes , fresh enoki , honey mushrooms , and others . " We give ideas for ways to incorporate exotic fruits into daily menus and we even have a guide to microwaving new and unusual produce , " Caplan says . <p> Caplan also sees an increasing demand for different kinds of produce as the ethnic population of the United States grows : Chinese , Japanese , Chileans , French , Indians , Koreans , and Mexicans will want the special foods of their homelands . " Seaweed , jicama , lemon grass , cactus leaves , kim chee , cherimoyas , shallots , are some of the new specialties that will become available , " she says . <p> Labels persuade shoppers <p> Labeling new foods is important , she says . " If you 're shopping and you see a shriveled , dark purple , egg-shaped thing among the bananas and oranges , of course you wo n't buy it . But if it 's labeled : ' Passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) give it a chance , " she says . <p> What shoppers look for when shopping for fresh produce is indicated in the 2,000-household survey reported by Ms. Riggs of Vance Publishing . " Shoppers consider six major topics when choosing fresh items , " she explains : taste , flavor , freshness , ripeness , appearance , and condition . " Price is important , but not at the loss of quality , " she added . <p> Why do people say they 're eating more fruit and vegetables ? <p> " Diet and nutrition head the list of reasons people give for eating more fresh vegetables , " according to the survey , says Riggs . Other reasons are snacking , concern about calories ( more than half those surveyed ) , and dollar value . Just under half the survey 's respondents said they were eating more produce because there are more kinds available . <p> Kiwi fruit was most often named as the newest food tried last year .

But there 's a countertrend : <p> " A few years ago we saw exotic produce being imported , but today many of those foods are grown here in the United States , " says Sidney Feinstein of RLB Foods in West Caldwell , N.J. " Today we do n't need to import radicchio from Italy or kiwi from New Zealand or yellow and purple peppers from Holland since they 're being grown here ... "
