Dealing with disabilities means first understanding them . // " I ca n't see ! I ca n't see ! " Life Scout Steve Schefe , 14 , staggered in a circle and threw up his hands in frustration . Standing nearby , Star Scout Landon Gilliam , also 14 , tried to keep things calm as they finished pitching a two-man tent on this sunny Colorado afternoon . " It 's O.K , " Landon said . " Just put that thing there . " " What thing where ? " Steve replied dryly . Another sightless Scout fumbled around the ground , grabbing a tent peg . " Not that , " Landon snapped , " the other-no , no , no , no . It 's by your foot , the pole is . " Landon tried pointing but quickly realized how useless that unseen gesture was . Meantime , Steve found the tent pole with his foot , tripped , fell-and took down two other Scouts . Steve sat up and yanked off the neckerchief covering his eyes . " Man , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Disability Trail Denver , Colo. , Troop 199 spent the day in Washington Park discovering what it is like to live with a disability . It was part of the Cultural Awareness theme , next month 's suggested troop program activity designed to show how to better understand all people , from folks with a heritage different from your own to individuals dealing with disabilities . The Scouts trekked a Disability Trail the troop set up . They pitched the tent , then ran an obstacle course , played basketball , interpreted sign language and more-all with eyes blindfolded , ears muffled , or a hand or foot bound . No one was hurt , but they learned about boys and girls who have been . Every day , about 140 kids in the United States suffer a permanent disability , according to National Safe Kids Campaign figures . Injury is the top health hazard for American children ( see " Safeguard Against Injuries " sidebar ) . But kids can be born with a disability . For example , about 3,000 babies a year are born with a brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in their early years . Disabilities can be mild or major , and include deafness , blindness , multiple sclerosis , muscular dystrophy , spina bifida and more . Some living with such conditions call themselves " handicapped . " Others opt for " disabled " or " special need . " Whatever the description , all seek the support and understanding that everyone expects as a human being . And the disabled do live full lives ; they scuba dive , fly airplanes , ride horseback , water-ski , even take African safaris by wheelchair , and more . Overcoming Obstacles The Denver Scouts got a taste of wheelchair sports by playing one-on-one basketball-with limited success . As First Class Scout Trevor Payne , 12 , rolled toward the basket , readying his shot , he shouted , " Hey , I ca n't get my chair to- " Crash . He ran into the pole supporting the backboard . Star Scout Ben Koller , 13 , got the ball and made a basket . But afterward he said what was on everyone 's mind : " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the guys talked about how they now were more aware of obstacles facing disabled people . They listed things that most people never think about needing . " There 's closed-captioned TV , " said Star Scout Trey Seaholm , 12 . " You read instead of hear shows . " " And text telephones at places like airports , " added Tenderfoot Scout Matthew Hock , 11 . " And those special parking spaces in parking lots . " " And Braille , " said Star Scout Cory Weis , 12 , mentioning the bump-like writing and printing that is read by fingertip touches .

Books and magazines are published in Braille . ( You could be reading this in the Braille edition of Boys ' Life ! ) Against All Odds Braille helped a young girl become famous .

Devoting her life to helping the blind and deaf around the world , she once wrote : They took away what should have been my eyes ( But I remembered Milton 's Paradise ) . They took away what should have been my ears ( Beethoven came and wiped away my tears ) . They took away what should have been my tongue ( But I had talked with God when I was young ) . He would not let them take away my soul . Possessing that , I still possess the whole . Denver Troop 199 seemed to fully understand the famous woman 's words . " Until you have a disability , you do n't think about not being able to do something , " Steve Schefe said , noting how lucky he was to discard his disability by simply pulling off the blindfold . " But everyone should know that it can happen to anyone . " // <p>        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
