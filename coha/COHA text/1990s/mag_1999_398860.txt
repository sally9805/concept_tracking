Section : THE Watercolor PAGE <p> Donna Barnes-Roberts earned a B.S. degree in botany from California State University in Los Angeles and worked as a computer scientist before becoming a full-time artist . Her paintings have been included in a number of important exhibitions and have received awards in shows organized by the California Art Club , the Torrance Artists Guild , the San Gabriel Fine Arts Association , and the Glendale Art Association . She is represented by Tirage Gallery in Pasadena , California . For her essays Oh art , a complete biography , and digital reproductions of her paintings , visit the artist 's Web site at : www.barnesroberts.com . <p> Armed with a B.S. degree in botany and a M.S. degree in computer science , Californian Donna Barnes-Roberts has the technical skills to paint plant life with scientific and photographic precision . But her motivation is not to paint specimens , rather it is to present subjects that stimulate a strong emotional response . " The point is to paint something that grabs me , " she explains . " It has to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power to set it apart from ordinary events and thereby reveal something about me and something about the person who views my painting . My knowledge of botany , photography , and computer science is simply a tool with which to accurately understand and communicate that emotional content . " <p> The knowledge Barnes-Roberts brings to her creative process is considerable , and it helps her understand the complex problems and considerable potential in using photographs and computer digital images in developing the subject matter of her watercolors . " I 've dabbled in photography for 30 years , so I understand how the camera and film record images , " she comments . " Values are pushed to extremes , particularly in the highlights and shadows , and certain colors shift and become flatter . I have to compensate for these distortions when I 'm developing a watercolor . " <p> Knowing when to photograph a subject is as important as knowing how to photograph it . " Because light is so important to our perception of things , the conditions during one hour of the day will be very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I sometimes discover flowers that would be best photographed in the morning or afternoon , so I return later in the day or early the next morning to see if my calculations are accurate . I may have to do that over several days to get just the right conditions . <p> " Film is a lot less valuable than my rime , " Barnes-Roberts continues , " so I shoot several rolls of film when I find a subject that might work as a painting . Sometimes I 'm shooting close-up shots of individual flowers and other times I 'm trying to compose the entire view into an arrangement that might work for a painting . I take a lot of photographs on the chance they might be useful . " <p> After reviewing the developed photographs , Barnes-Roberts scans the best shots into her computer and manipulates them with Adobe Photoshop software . " I can add or subtract elements , recompose the picture , change the colors , and separate the image into layers , " the artist explains . " The computer allows me to consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translating it into watercolor . " <p> Once satisfied with the computerized picture , Barnes-Roberts generates a color printout that becomes one of the resources to guide her through the painting process . " Sometimes I project a photograph or scale it up to the size of the watercolor paper , but more often I make a freehand drawing of the key elements of the picture , ' she says . " I use the photograph and computer printout as guides to the painting process . " <p> After making a graphite pencil drawing on a sheet of 140-lb cold-pressed paper ( either Lanaquarelle or Winsor &; Newton ) , Barnes-Roberts coats the entire surface with a solution of oxgall ( 16 drops in 8 oz of water ) . " The application of oxgall does two important things for the paper , " she explains . " The first is that the coated surface accepts brushstrokes of watercolor much more readily . Soaking and stretching the paper accomplishes the same thing , but the paper loses much of its sizing in the process . An application of oxgall does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second reason to cover the paper with a solution of oxgall is that it gets rid of those tiny white dots that sometimes appear in the middle of a dark wash of color , " Barnes-Roberts goes on to say . " Those dandruff-like spots can ruin a solid dark background or a uniform wash of color . " <p> The palette of colors Barnes-Roberts uses includes indigo , Winsor yellow deep , Winsor yellow light , permanent rose , permanent alizarin crimson , cadmium red , ultramarine blue , Antwerp blue , permanent sap green , Winsor green ( blue hue ) , and burnt sienna . She finds indigo to be one of the most useful colors for establishing a cool dark tone , as well as certain green colors . <p> Barnes-Roberts usually begins by painting the local color of the flowers and leaves and then glazing over them with shadow tones to model the three-dimensional form . Some blossoms call for the use of a backwash , where one brushstroke of paint blends into another . " A watercolorist becomes sensitive to the way wet-in-wet colors will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of color will coalesce , " she comments . " Those are understandings that come from years of painting . " <p> While the darkest tones are usually reserved for the final stages of the painting process , Barnes-Roberts will occasionally paint them earlier . " Sometimes I paint the darks earlier to establish the larger three-dimensional forms of the subject , " she explains . " Dark backgrounds are always reserved for later stages , even though painting them earlier might be helpful in visualizing the correct values in the finished painting . Many of these dark backgrounds contain so much pigment that I can not risk touching them with a wet brush while painting a pale flower and having that pigment bleed into the flower . This is where photographs and computer studies are so valuable . I need to have faith that if I paint the values true to my source material it will look good when the background goes in , even though it may go through intermediate stages where the painting looks disjointed and strange . " <p> Barnes-Roberts has strong feelings about painting subjects that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Many people consider flowers to be the very essence of beauty , " she says . " Paintings about flowers reveal who you are , where you came from , what 's important in your life , and how you differ from other people . To me , they are one of the places where the heart can be found . " <p> Opposite page , above : Two Sides of Darkness , 1997 , watercolor , 22 x 30 .
