GOING POSTAL THE NEW PONY EXPRESS PICKS THIS YEAR 'S TOUR DE FRANCE CONTENDERS Photograph Tyler Hamilton shaves some speed in the Redlands Classic last March . He finished fifth in the stage race . // So what are you guys doing today ? " I asked Frankie Andreu of the U.S. Postal Service team . The 15-man pro squad was rolling out on a training ride last winter in the mountains above San Diego . Andreu , a grizzled veteran of six Tours de France , had drifted to the back of the double paceline , where I sat sucking wheels during the warm-up . " Well , " Andreu replied , " some guys want to do three hours and some of us want ot do five hours . " The day before , the Postmen did a hard four-hour workout with two hours-two hours ! - of intervals . Today some of the guys seemed ready for an easier session at this , the mid-way point of their two-week pre-season traning camp . In a few weeks they 'd be in Europe for the first races @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months but whose exclamation point is the Tour de France from July 11 to August 2 . The group warms up for an hour , easy , then stops at an intersection . The three-hour gang wants to turn left and head home , especially one young American rider who happily reminds his teammates he has a date with a stewardess who 's driving up from San Diego . But wait . Several riders cluster around the team car . There 's much talking and pointing . Suddenly it 's decided : Everyone will do the five-hour ride . " Ohhh , man , " says the young Don Juan . " She better wait for me . " His teammates show their sympathy by laughing . Things have gotten a bit more serious these days for the USPS team , which , with eight U.S. pros , has taken over the unofficial status of " America 's team " from the now-defunct Motorola squad . Last year the Postmen wrangled a late invitation to the big dance known as Le Tour and performed above the experts ' expectations , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All nine USPS riders finished the race and team leader JeanCyril Robin of France placed 15th overall . This year USPS is one of 16 elite squads earning early entry into the Tour . In some ways , that takes the pressure off , because the Postmen can focus on Tour preparation rather than getting early-season results that would convince Tour poobahs to include them . What 's more , even though the teams Lance Armstrong says he wo n't ride this year 's Tour , his presence on the team has generated more prestige and exposure as the media chronicle his compelling comeback from cancer . But pressure on the team to perform only increases . To get right to the point : No , the team does n't have a real contender for the crown , won last year by German phenom Jan Ullrich . ( Though we did ask all the Americans on USPS for their ' 98 picks , some of which may surprise you . ) Still , this time the Postmen wo n't be content simply to be in The Show . " We want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top 10 GC ( General Classification ) , " says Mark Gorski , the former Olympic gold medalist who 's now USPS 's directeur sportif Gorski sees Robin-a.k.aJ.C. - as a possible top-10 finisher . Another rider with GC potential is Dariusz Baranowski of Poland . For stage wins , watch for the cagey Russian veteran Viatcheslav Ekimov , who favors late solo breakaways ; American George Hincapie , who could win from a small group ; and German sprinter Sven Teutenberg , who came to camp much fitter than he did last year . Another key is new recruit Andreu , whose contributions ca n't be measured in podium appearances . " Frankie makes a big difference-he 's a very savvy , vocal leader , " says Gorski . " I 'm excited . This year we 're much stronger , top to bottom . " This time the Postmen and their opponents will encounter a Tour that 's markedly different from last year 's race . For starters , it begins a week later than normal , to avoid a conflict with the World Cup soccer finals being held this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2,300-mile race will begin in Ireland , with the prologue time trial in Dublin , followed by one stage around the city and another to Cork . From there , planes and ferries will transport the race caravan to France for the remaining 19 stages . Other changes have been made to cut the huge number of crashes that plagued last year 's Tour . Organizers have reduced the field from 22 to 21 or 20 teams of nine riders , which means the peloton will shrink from 198 to as low as 180 . Also , more stages will finish in bigger cities with wider roads . And for safety reasons the UCI has banned the popular Spinaci-type mini aerobars . But the change most likely to influence the race 's outcome is the route : substantially flatter than last year 's mountain-fest . This year 's Tour features just two mountain-top finishes ( stage 11 to Plateau de Beille in the Pyrenees and stage 15 to Les DeuxAlpes in the Alps ) , compared to four in ' 97 . Riders will spend a total of five days in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet of climbing . The course profile drew criticism from last year 's runner-up ( and King of the Mountains winner ) Richard Virenque . The Frenchman wanted more ascending in order to threaten Ullrich , who gained most of his nineminute winning margin in the time trials and looked vulnerable in some of the final week 's mountains . Another contender who would have benefited from a hillier route is Italian superclimber Marco Pantani . The bald dynamo finished third overall after impressive wins on two mountain stages , including the legendary Alpe d'Huez ( which is absent from this year 's route ) . The other crucial stages , a 36-mile time trial on stage 7 and a 33-miler on stage 20 , also seem to favor Ullrich . The young German carved three minutes out of his nearest rival in last year 's first long race against the clock . Still , both of this year 's TTs are hilly , giving some hope to the climbers . Other pretenders to Ullrich 's throne include his Telekom teammate Bjarne Riis of Denmark , who slipped to seventh last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who came in second ) . Riis could contend if Ullrich falters , but it 's hard to imagine Telekom letting him challenge if the German is riding well . Complicating matters , Ullrich began the season noticeably overweight , and Riis suffered a wrist injury that forced him to miss several big spring races . Team loyalty could also be tested on the dangerous Festina squad , which signed the talented Alex Zulle of Switzerland to join Virenque . As a Frenchman on a French team , an on-form Virenque would probably start as team leader , but Zulle may be a more complete riderexcept for his trouble keeping the rubber-side down in bad weather ( see Armstrong 's predictions ) .
