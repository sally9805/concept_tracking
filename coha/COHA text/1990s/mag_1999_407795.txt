How the networks covered the sudden , shocking death of John F. Kennedy . Again . by Benjamin Svetkey // WHERE WERE YOU WHEN you heard that John F. Kennedy was dead ? It used to be a much simpler question . Thirty-six years ago , America learned about the stunning tragedy from a shaken Walter Cronkite on a fuzzy , black-and-white cathode-ray contraption with only a halfdozen channels on its dial . Today-last week-the news of JFK Jr . ' s death was delivered by a very different device , a distant descendant of that boxy Philco that 's evolved in ways those watching back in November 1963 would never have imagined . Or believed . Or maybe desired . The assassination of President Kennedy was television 's first great test as a nationuniting medium . In urgent weinterrupt-this-program bulletins-they must have seemed so breathtakingly modern then ; they look so heartbreakingly old-fashioned now-TV made its maiden attempt at covering an unfolding disaster as it happened . Decades later , with the rise of round-the-clock cablecasting , almost all news is presented in what 's come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the interruptions are the programming . And yet , poignantly , there are some eerie similaritiessome ghosts on the screen-in the way TV told us about these two inextricably connected calamities . For instance : Despite all that 's changed about television over the years-and all that 's changed about America-the death of the son turned out to be every bit as sad and shocking as the death of the father . THE FIRST RUMORS BEgan creeping into newsrooms very early Saturday morning , in those predawn hours when TV stations used to sign off with " The Star-Spangled Banner " ( back when TV stations actually did sign off ) . The details were sketchy : A single-engine Piper Saratoga airplane , owned and piloted by John F. Kennedy Jr. , carrying his wife , Carolyn Bessette Kennedy , and her sister Lauren Bessette , had disappeared over the ocean somewhere between New Jersey and Martha 's Vineyard . NBC 's Robert Hager was the first to break the news on the air-at 8:05 a.m. - but within minutes , every cable news channel and most of the broadcast networks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CBS was on the job early , with Dan Rather beating both Tom Brokaw and Peter Jennings to the anchor chair . There was n't much news to report-we learned that Kennedy had purchased the plane two months ago ; that they were flying to Cape Cod to attend cousin Rory Kennedy 's wedding-but it did n't matter . On every channel you could find the same aerial shots , videotaped by news choppers hovering over Coast Guard helicopters hovering over searchand-rescue boats . On most channels , not even commercials were permitted to intrude on the vigil . Photograph // MSNBC-the network that forged its identity with 24-hour coverage of Princess Di 's fatal car crash two years ago-kept the aerial footage rolling pretty much all day , with Brian Williams filling the airwaves with whatever came into his head ( a discourse on the relative dangers of singleversus twin-engine airplanes , for example ) . On ABC , Jennings broke away from the chopper shots for a chat with his colleague Barbara Walters , who recalled her visit to the Kennedy compound years ago ( the same compound where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of camera crews were peering with telescopic lenses ) . CNN 's Bernard Shaw interviewed CNN 's Christiane Amanpour , who had known Kennedy when they were both in college ( he went to Brown in Providence , she went to the University of Rhode Island in nearby Kingston ) . And on CBS , Rather choked up while reading the lyrics to " Camelot . " Hard to imagine Cronkite making that choice , but at least Rather did n't sing . Newsroom decor has changed dramatically since the days of wood-paneled walls with lots of clocks , but confusion and misinformation in the midst of crisis apparently never go out of style . With so little fact to report , all sorts of rumors and speculation were flung at the screenthen carefully scraped off when proved erroneous . There was , for instance , the Second Pilot Theory , with early ( false ) reports that Kennedy 's flight instructor was also on board the plane . Later in the day there was much debate about weather conditions and how a summer haze hanging over the island might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stone-type conspiracies , but some chilling coincidences were noted : Kennedy 's plane went down three years to the day after TWA Flight 800 exploded off the coast of Long Island , and exactly 30 years since Ted Kennedy 's car crash at Chappaquiddick killed Mary Jo Kopechne . There was also plenty of discussion about JFK Jr . ' s capabilities as a pilot , a lot of it unfavorable . For most of the day , commentators struggled to refer to the presumed victims in the present tense . But by late Saturday afternoon , when the Coast Guard started picking debris out of the water , Kennedy and his passengers began to slip into the past . Among the items fished from the sea : an airplane headrest , some carpeting , and a suitcase with a luggage tag still attached . At first , officials would n't say whose name was on that luggage-they wanted to notify family members before the press , they explained-but it did n't take long to find out . Within hours , CNN aired a photograph of the bag , flecked with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tag holder . It was a tough picture to take in , a little like that famous LIFE photo of President Kennedy 's bloody shirt . The difference was that LIFE ran its shot a full year after JFK 's death . TV did n't wait a day . Photograph AN EXAMINED LIFE Kennedy was never far from the spotlight , whether he was ( 1 ) peddling magazines to Candice Bergen on Murphy Brown or to ( 2 ) Jay Leno on The Tonight Show ; ( 3 ) unveiling his glam-wonk journal George ; ( 4 ) dashing with Hannah on Martha 's Vineyard ; or ( 5 ) exploring his thespian tendencies in the indie flick Winners // Many of the proceedings were strangely , surprisingly familiar . The interviews with neighbors , the innumerable talking heads , the impromptu shrines of flowers and candies-it was as if the day were following a groove carved by so many televised tragedies before it . The press conferences in particular seemed like hollow rituals , revealing little that had n't already been leaked on the air . But there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NBC correspondent asked whether the Coast Guard allocated the same extensive resources to private-plane crashes that do n't involve 38-year-old sons of slain Presidents . It may have been a tactless question . Or it may have been entirely appropriate . Either way , the answer was obvious . OF COURSE THIS PARTICULAR crash received special attention , no matter how much the Coast Guard denied it , for precisely the same reason it was getting special attention from all those reporters frantically covering the story . Because John F. Kennedy Jr . was n't merely a celebrity , was n't merely the son of a President , was n't merely the " Sexiest Man Alive " ( according to PEOPLE magazine and pretty much every American citizen with two X chromosomes ) . He was also television 's First Child , a vacuum-tube baby whose custody was shared by an entire nation . Like the star of his own real-life Thu.man Show , JFK Jr . was trailed by cameras and microphones from the day he was born ( just weeks after his dad won the 1960 presidential election ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one of the most famous images of this century ) , failing his bar exams as a law student ( " The Hunk Flunks , " announced the New York Post ) , dating movie stars ( Sarah Jessica Parker , Daryl Hannah ) , and marrying Carolyn ( he did manage to elude the cameras that time , but there were videos of the couple fighting in Central ParkS his entire life was lived in front of the entire world . He was , in short , the purest form of celebrity ever distilled : enormously famous for being enormously famous . And nobody knew that better than he did . No doubt it was his inspiration for George , the glossy Cosmo-meets-Commentary political journal he started publishing four years ago ( its first cover featured Cindy Crawford as a bosomy George Washington ) . " Politics is not distinct from popular culture , " he explained on Meet the Press in 1997 , promising his magazine would " deal with politics the way many people deal with music , art , and sports . " That nexus between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he once did a cameo on Murphy Brown , had a brief role in the 1985 indie flick Winners , and was said to have loved the JFK Jr . character on Seinfeld ) . And it was a clever premise for a magazine . Although George has n't earned any money so far-and now may not long survive its founder-it did give Kennedy an aura of gravity and independence he 'd never achieved before . Many of the commentators covering his plane crash last weekend prophesied that had he lived , he might have ridden that aura all the way to the White House . Now , of course , we will never know . Instead , television is burying its firstborn the only way it knows how . By the time the sun finally set on that sad Saturday in Martha 's Vineyard , Kennedy 's life in front of the camerathat is to say , his whole lifehad been spliced into a funeral dirge of video clips that played hauntingly on the airwaves all night long . Watching it flicker on the screen , you could almost see-in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being hammered into legend . Like father , like son .
