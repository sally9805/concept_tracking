For 50 years America marshaled the forces of freedom with the hope that someday the Russian people could gain a chance to determine their future by choosing their leaders . Now they are about to vote in the first presidential election in Russia 's history as an independent country . Far from fearing the result , we should have confidence that in the long run democracy in Russia can only benefit America and the world . <P> Whichever candidate wins in June , our task will be the same : to keep America safe , and to consolidate the gains for peace and freedom made possible by the cold war 's end . That is what President Clinton has sought to do with bipartisan support since 1993 . As a result , every American is more secure . Consider the facts : <P> Thousands of nuclear warheads , built to destroy America , have themselves been destroyed . Those that remain in Russia no longer target our homes . Three of the four nuclear states that succeeded the Soviet Union have abandoned nuclear weapons . We are working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclear materials from terrorists and rogue states , and to realize President Kennedy 's dream of a total ban on nuclear testing . The space race has been eclipsed by our joint construction of an international space station . <P> Twelve new states have replaced the Soviet empire , including an independent Ukraine that is building a strong partnership with the U.S. and Europe . Russian troops no longer occupy either Central Europe or , thanks to President Clinton 's personal diplomacy , the Baltic states . Instead , they are serving alongside us to bring peace to Bosnia . While we do not always agree with Russian policies , today not every difference is a crisis . We can manage the issues between us constructively without the threat of nuclear confrontation . <P> After three years of intensive involvement with the Russians , I am convinced that the safer world we are building is more likely to endure if market democracy sinks deeper roots in Russian soil . We should not lose sight of the progress already made : Russians are now empowered by the ballot and by free enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off from the world by minefields and barbed wire . Over half their economy is in private hands , guided increasingly by the laws of the market and the will of the consumer . The longer this process continues , the harder it will be for any Russian leader to restore totalitarian rule . <P> Of course , these changes have not come easily , and reform is under great strain . Most Russians have felt the pain of economic dislocation , rampant crime and corruption . Many have been disillusioned by a lack of accountability in government and by the brutal war in Chechnya . <P> Whatever government emerges from the coming elections , it will face the same circumstances : an economy that can prosper only if market reforms continue , if business is free to compete and if borders are open to trade ; a war in Chechnya that can only be resolved politically ; and an international community that wants Russia to be fully integrated  --  as long as it respects international norms . The proposals of Russia 's Communists , among others , are a serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be how Russia 's next government actually responds to these challenges .
