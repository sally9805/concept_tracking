THE SUN IS ON THE WAY UP TO the maximum of its 11-year activity cycle , and the signs have been getting more frequent in the past several months . The Sun 's disk has sported sunspots that can be seen to the ( properly filtered ) naked eye , and observers at midnorthern latitudes have witnessed auroral displays triggered by solar storms . This has rekindled interest in auroras and led people to wonder when we 'll get the next display of northern lights . Unfortunately , auroras are largely unpredictable . Although the Sun and Earth 's geomagnetic environment are well monitored by satellites and government agencies issue warnings with a day or two 's notice , there 's still no guarantee that the sky will be set aglow during any given disturbance . Astronomers will know that a surge of charged particles is heading toward Earth , but they wo n't know if it will actually affect the upper atmosphere nor what the visible result will be . Auroras tend to be witnessed when people just happen to be watching the sky by chance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , you could conceivably see a posting on a message board or newsgroup that cries , " Aurora happening right now ! " and go out in time to see it . Viewers in Europe could serve as sentries for observers in the United States , where darkness comes several hours later . If you want to boost your chances of seeing an aurora during the coming solar maximum and are n't willing to relocate under the aurora-rich skies of Alaska or northern Canada , the best way is to keep yourself informed by checking the geomagnetic forecast . The Space Weather Bureau ( http : //www.spaceweather.com/ ) at NASA 's Marshall Space Flight Center offers an inviting layout of geomagnetic news and links . Here is a central site to find out what the Sun is spewing our way . You 'll find daily reports of solar and geomagnetic activity , including the probability of solar flares . Photograph // For a graphical representation of the chances of an aurora , visit the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's Space Environment Center ( http : // www.sel.noaa.gov/ ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " auroral oval " - the region of the upper atmosphere that is currently being excited by charged particles . The farther south the oval is , the more intense the display with it is likely to be . The University of Alaska 's Geophysical Institute 's site ( http : //dac3.pfrr.alaska.edu/ aurora/ ) has weekly aurora forecasts as well as pictures and animations of recent activity . If you 're lucky to be on the site when a camera is taking data , you may see an aurora as it happens . A sibling Web site to NASA 's Space Weather page will help you catch up on another aspect of solar activity : sunspots . According to the plot of estimated sunspot numbers at Sunspots and the Solar Cycle ( http : //www.sunspotcycle.com/ ) , the peak will come during 2001 , and recent counts have been right on track . The site also provides historical sunspot numbers . If you 're searching for current views of the Sun , many solar observatories provide daily images . Among them are the National Solar Observatory at Kitt Peak ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Sacramento Peak ( http : //vtt. **30;1430;TOOLONG ) , and Big Bear Solar Observatory ( http : //www. bbso.njit.edu/ ) . The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory spacecraft ( http : // sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/ ) stopped providing daily ultraviolet images when it fell silent in June . But now that it is on the rebound ( see page 20 ) , its space-based views should continue for the rest of the solar cycle . In any case , you can also look back at SOHO 's past observations , including fascinating movies of comets making kamikaze dives into the Sun . * <p>
