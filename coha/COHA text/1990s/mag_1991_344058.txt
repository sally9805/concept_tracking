REGARDING HENRY Directed by Mike Nichols ; Screenplay by Jeffrey Abrams <P> Nobody has a life anymore , Hollywood tells us , only an afterlife . By now you are familiar with all those transcendental rehab movies  --  Ghost and its spectrally sentimental cousins  --  in which people return from the void to get a chance to say ( What else ? ) " I love you . " Audiences lose themselves in a teary mixture of awe and awww at these wistful fantasies , which now constitute an entire genre : sigh-fi . <P> Regarding Henry , Mike Nichols ' effective , infuriating new weepie , works a cunning variation on the born-again theme . It eliminates the middleman , Death , by subjecting Henry Turner ( Harrison Ford ) to a gunshot wound that erases his memory . Bang ! , you 're a new man . The old one needed some revision . That Henry was a slick Manhattan lawyer who misused his gifts to ruin innocent men and save venal corporations . Instructed by his chic wife ( Annette Bening ) to apologize to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scolds the dear girl in Latin . The guy barely deserves to live , until he gets a chance to do it right , from scratch . <P> After his injury , Henry must be taught everything over again , from how to walk to who he is . Ford , whose face assumes the agreeable befuddlement of Mortimer Snerd , plays Henry as an eager but slightly backward child . He returns to his posh Fifth Avenue apartment as if he had been consigned to a foster home . But because his teachers are kind and patient , he becomes a new man and determines to right the wrongs he committed in his earlier life . He is like a reformed Scrooge on a very long Christmas Day . He will buy his daughter a puppy and even become that most improbable creature , an honest lawyer . <P> This is , recall , a fantasy , set in the old-fashioned movie Manhattan that is a beautiful place to be lost in . Nichols , as always , is terrific at suggesting worlds without words . The camera catches a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we know in that instant that she has had an affair with the old , nasty Henry . But then the script insists that these epiphanies be spelled out in illuminated capital letters ; and Nichols , a jaunty yachtsman of a director , must trawl through treacle . Strings swell at the merest emotion . And  --  lordy !  --  dog-reaction shots ! By the end , when the pooch trots into a school chapel , you may want the animal to pee on a pew . <P> $ We bet that the picture will be a hit  --  not because it is so smart about many small things but because it is so shameless in promoting its one big thing . Like the other sigh-fi movies , Regarding Henry says any mortal catastrophe offers an opportunity to erase the chalkboard mess we have made of our lives . We can make amends and have great sex too . By serving up comfy antidotes to illness and death , these movies provide a seductively meretricious form of release : New Age religion on the cheap . How like Hollywood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives is mere fodder for a better , more glamorous sequel .
