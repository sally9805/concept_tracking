I AM AFRAID we have programmed surprise out of Christmas . Reaping the rewards of being well fed , well clothed and well housed , we give and receive gifts based not on needs but on wants . We submit our want-lists or at least drop hints . And if we do n't want what we get or it does n't fit , we exchange it for something better . But what if Christmas is about a real surprise ? Something we do not expect at all or even want , a gift we ca n't take back ? What if Christmas is about God 's surprising work which is a total reversal of our want-lists ? The lessons for the Fourth Sunday of Advent are like packages waiting under the Christmas tree . Each contains gifts that are real surprises , whether it 's the psalmist giving voice to a people 's plaintive cry for restoration , or Micah speaking of the Coming One who will bring about that restoration , or the author of the Letter to the Hebrews celebrating a completed act of restoration given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When the curtain goes up in chapter one of Luke 's Gospel strange things are happening . It seems God is not in heaven but is busy as the restless , innovative Creator , working in a hidden corner of earth . As an " emeritus " minister , I find it reassuring that God begins by talking to older folk . In the biblical narrative , people of age are not written off nor are they beyond being surprised . I also find it reassuring that surprises can take place during the liturgical services of the old temple , and not necessarily in " contemporary " services . In fact , a surprise occurs as the old priest Zechariah is simply doing his duty . Amid the rising smoke of incense an angelic messenger appears to tell him that his prayer has been answered but not necessarily as he had asked . Zechariah hears shocking news : like Abraham and Sarah , he and Elizabeth will have joy and gladness in their old age . Although barren and advanced in years , Elizabeth will bear a son who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make people ready for the coming of the Lord . That 's the first surprise . Nothing is too hard for the Lord , which is what leads old Sarah to break out in toothless laughter , and Zechariah to become speechless . There are more surprises . The angel Gabriel pays a visit to a little hick town called Nazareth  --  so unlikely a place for anything angelic to happen that it earned the saying : " Can anything good come out of Nazareth ? " Gabriel greets a poor country girl who must have been surprised out of her wits . " Hail , O favored one , the Lord is with you . " Then she is told that she is to become pregnant by the overshadowing power of the Holy Spirit . The surprise and shock are almost unbearable . " You 've got to be kidding . How can this be since I have no husband ? How will Mom and Dad take the news , much less my boyfriend ? Holy Spirit ? Who is the joke on anyway ? " To ease the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another secret . Despite her age and barrenness , Mary 's relative Elizabeth is also pregnant . The mystery of Advent grows in ever widening circles , revealing that God 's surprising work can take place in age or youth , in temple or in odd places like Nazareth ( Micah says in the smallest clans of Judah ) , in barrenness or in virginity . God 's surprise not only shatters human expectations but opens up the future to a world where everything is possible , including the final setting of things right . Now we see the acorn , which is oakness in a nutshell . Once that shell is broken open , all the oakness will break loose . In the meeting of two pregnant women , the parallels are worth noting . Just as Jesus came to John the Baptist in the wilderness , so Mary comes " with haste " to Elizabeth , whose child John is leaping for joy in her womb . Just as John recognized in Jesus the more powerful One who is coming , so Elizabeth greets Mary as one highly favored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The surprise is in seeing God in small beginnings ! Two women , blessing and praising , mark the beginning of God 's greatest surprise of all  --  the great reversal where God will cut down arrogant people of power and offer to the powerless a future and a hope . Mary 's Magnificat still comes a bit too close to home as it tells us that Christmas is not about getting what we want but about God both getting and giving what God wants . Good news of great joy and great discomfort . Beware , you powerful ! Hope and rejoice , you powerless ! This is the real surprise of Christmas : the lifting up of the lowly and the filling of the hungry with good things while overthrowing the powerful and sending the rich away empty . As we move like Mary " with great haste " toward the birthing , I hope we can linger a bit longer in that little hut in the Judean hill country with Elizabeth and Mary , if only to learn how to be better receivers of God 's surprising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come about , it will be when we give up control , somewhat as these two women did before the greater things stirring in them . Of God 's surprising work Mary says , " Be it done to me according to thy word . " Are we ever ready for God 's surprises ? No amount of advance preparation seems to do the trick . Yet I also know that the Coming One is already on his way , that he is already here whether we are ready or not . And the surprise in his coming is always greater than we know or sometimes want .
