URANUS AT OPPOSITION None of the usual reasons for enjoying a planet without optical aid apply to the planet Uranus . Although four planet Earths could be placed side by side in front of Uranus , this planet is extremely remote from us at a billion-and-a-half miles away . It does n't appear bright in our sky , change significantly in brightness , or move rapidly in front of the stars . Some planets appear striking when near Earth 's Moon , but bright moonlight only drowns Uranus from view . The greatest thrill to be had from Uranus is merely seeing it ! And yet even a glimpse of this remote outer world can be memorable . If you 've not yet seen the planet , this is the best month all year to do so . Uranus comes to opposition on July 7 . That is the evening when Earth flies between it and the Sun . At opposition , Uranus rises at sunset and casts its dim light in the heavens all night long . The planet lies in the star-rich constellation Sagittarius . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a greenish color . Stars rarely ( some say never ) appear green . Uranus shines at magnitude 5.6 . Look for it in a dark sky , far from city lights , on a night when the Moan is down . Search with binoculars first , but once you have found the planet , lay the binoculars aside for a glimpse of Uranus with the naked eye . Then try the binoculars again . Do they intensify the greenish color of this world ? Notice that even with binoculars you can not see Uranus as anything more than a point of light . An amazing fact about Uranus is that its axis of rotation is tipped almost parallel to the plane of the solar system . In 1985 , we viewed this planet 's south pole almost directly pole-on , and things have not changed much since then . Uranus has at least fifteen moons , all smaller than Earth 's Moon , orbiting in the plane of the planet 's equator . Large telescopes are needed to see these moons , but imaginations can be employed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Earth , the Uranian system can be imagined as being rather like a target , with Uranus itself at the bull 's eye . By the way , another outer planet lies just a few degrees from Uranus on the sky 's dome now , but you ca n't glimpse Neptune with the unaided eye . Neptune and Uranus are about the same size , but Neptune is nearly a billion miles farther away when it 's at opposition on July 9 . MERCURY AT GREATEST ELONGATION When July opens , the innermost planet Mercury is in the middle of a long evening apparition . Look far the planet low in the west-northwest no later than about 45 minutes after sunset . The planet shines at magnitude 0.3 when the month begins . The waxing crescent Moon sweeps left of Mercury on July 2 . Greatest elongation  --  Mercury 's greatest apparent distance from the Sun on the dome of our sky  --  comes on July 5 . Then the planet is 26deg east of the Sun . A much brighter planet can be seen above and left of Mercury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - 1.8 . The bright star between Mercury and Jupiter is Regulus , in the constellation Leo . After greatest elongation , Mercury begins sinking rapidly toward the western horizon after sunset . It fades rapidly in brightness and thus becomes increasingly difficult to see in the twilight glare . Meanwhile , Jupiter and Regulus are drawing closer to Mercury as they also plunge toward the western horizon . Jupiter begins the month about 30deg from Mercury , but it is closer to the planet when Mercury disappears around mid-month . SUMMER METEORS Late July and early August generally are wonderful times of year for watching meteors . The nights are warm , and two major showers  --  the Delta Aquarids and the Perseids  --  join forces to produce some fabulous displays . This year the Full Moon on August 13 will interfere with the peak of the Perseids . But since the parent comet of the Perseids is predicted by some to return this year and since great meteor storms can often accompany the return of such a comet , this is an excellent year to watch for meteors more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July , around the time of New Moon on July 29 . The Delta Aquarid shower has its ill-defined peak around then . This shower may actually produce a greater total number of meteors than the Perseids , but the shower is less widely known because it lacks a sharp peak . Do n't forget : you will see more meteors in a dark country sky , in the hours after midnight . It 's no problem telling a Perseid meteor from a Delta Aquarid. lust remember that meteor names are derived from the point in our sky from which they appear to radiate . You 'll see meteors in all parts of the sky , but take note of the direction from which they come . If you are watching before dawn , and the meteors fly from the southwest , they are Delta Aquarids . If they come from the northeast , they are Perseids . JULY 'S PLANETS Mercury is low in the west after sunset when the month begins . Look for it about 30 minutes after the Sun goes down . It 'll be shining at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to see Mercury is around July 2 , when the Moon sweeps nearby . A few days later , on July 5 , Mercury comes to greatest elongation . Then it is farthest from the Sun on the starry dome for this evening apparition . Jupiter is still very bright , but it 's clearly sinking lower in the west each evening . Soon it will sink out of sight . This is happening because Earth has now moved far ahead of Jupiter in the race of the planets around the Sun . Our motion will bring the Sun between us and Jupiter in September . Jupiter now shines at magnitude - 1.8 . It is still in front of Leo , not far from Regulus , Leo 's brightest star . Look for the waxing crescent Moon near Regulus and Jupiter around July 3 and 4 . An even younger Moon appears 8deg below Jupiter on the evening of July 31 . Saturn , in Capricornus , rises near the end of evening twilight on July 1 and earlier as the month progresses . Saturn will reach opposition in August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon us . This month Saturn shines at about magnitude 0.3 . Look for the Moon near Saturn on July 16 . By the way , Saturn is famous for being the planet with the widest and brightest system of rings . But in the last couple of decades , studies made of Saturn by spacecraft have revealed that the rings probably did n't form with the planet . Now it 's estimated that Saturn 's rings have a history of only about 100 million years . That means that if the dinosaurs had had telescopes when they ruled the Earth , they would have seen a ringless Saturn ! Mars is still coming up in the wee hours , but it has now climbed a respectable distance from the light of dawn and brightened to magnitude 0.8 . Mars passes from the constellation Aries to Taurus in mid-month . It is creeping toward Aldebaran , the bright reddish star at the heart of the Bull . On the morning of July 25 , Mars appears in a striking arrangement with the Moon and the Pleiades star cluster . Before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all  --  comes into view low in the evening twilight sky . Venus shines at magnitude - 3.9 . It can be seen very near the western horizon , shining brilliantly , about 30deg to the lower right of Jupiter . THE STARRY SKY As you gaze toward Uranus this month , you 're looking toward a region of the heavens not only beautiful to see , but also wonderful to contemplate . Uranus is located in front of the constellation Sagittarius , whose stars represent a mythological archer . This part of the sky marks the direction to the star-rich center of our own Milky Way Galaxy . In Greek mythology , Sagittarius was associated with Chiron , one of the legendary centaurs . Most centaurs were said to be wild , quarrelsome , and destructive , but Chiron was friendly and wise , and skilled in hunting , music , and medicine . He is said to have been tutor and foster father of Aesculapius , the physician whose story we told last month . Chiron was also a friend to Hercules . It 's said that Chiron met his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was accidently struck by one of Hercules ' poisoned arrows . Chiron was immortal and thus , to the gentle centaur , the wound would mean never-ending pain . When he asked Zeus to allow him to die , the king of the gods placed him among the stars .
