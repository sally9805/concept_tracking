AN HOUR LATER AND HE MIGHT NOT have noticed the rock , much less stooped to pick it up . But the early morning sunlight slanting across the Namibian desert in southwestern Africa happened to illuminate momentarily some strange squiggles on a chunk of sandstone . At first Douglas Erwin , a paleobiologist at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington , wondered if the meandering markings might be dried-up curls of prehistoric sea mud . But no , he decided after studying the patterns for a while , these were burrows carved by a small , wormlike creature that arose in long-vanished subtropical seas  --  an archaic organism that , as Erwin later confirmed , lived about 550 million years ago , just before the geological period known as the Cambrian . <P> As such , the innocuous-seeming creature and its curvy spoor mark the threshold of a critical interlude in the history of life . For the Cambrian is a period distinguished by the abrupt appearance of an astonishing array of multicelled animals  --  animals that are the ancestors of virtually all the creatures that now swim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while most people cling to the notion that evolution works its magic over millions of years , scientists are realizing that biological change often occurs in sudden fits and starts . And none of those fitful starts was more dramatic , more productive or more mysterious than the one that occurred shortly after Erwin 's wormlike creature slithered through the primordial seas . All around the world , in layers of rock just slightly younger than that Erwin discovered , scientists have found the mineralized remains of organisms that represent the emergence of nearly every major branch in the zoological tree . Among them : bristle worms and roundworms , lamp shells and mollusks , sea cucumbers and jellyfish , not to mention an endless parade of arthropods , those spindly legged , hard-shelled ancient cousins of crabs and lobsters , spiders and flies . There are even occasional glimpses  --  in rock laid down not long after Erwin 's Namibian sandstone  --  of small , ribbony swimmers with a rodlike spine that are unprepossessing progenitors of the chordate line , which leads to fish , to amphibians and eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from , and why did it emerge so quickly ? In recent years , no question has stirred the imagination of more evolutionary experts , spawned more novel theories or spurred more far-flung expeditions . Life has occupied the planet for nearly 4 billion of its 4.5 billion years . But until about 600 million years ago , there were no organisms more complex than bacteria , multicelled algae and single-celled plankton . The first hint of biological ferment was a plethora of mysterious palm-shape , frondlike creatures that vanished as inexplicably as they appeared . Then , 543 million years ago , in the early Cambrian , within the span of no more than 10 million years , creatures with teeth and tentacles and claws and jaws materialized with the suddenness of apparitions . In a burst of creativity like nothing before or since , nature appears to have sketched out the blueprints for virtually the whole of the animal kingdom . This explosion of biological diversity is described by scientists as biology 's Big Bang .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
