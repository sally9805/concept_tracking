Swimming , swimming In the swimming pool When days are hot , when days are cold In the swimming pool Oh , do n't you wish you never had anything else to do ? That action rhyme could be my children 's theme song . Although none of them ever had formal lessons until swimming was taught in grade three , all of them learned to swim by age three or four and have been enthusiastic about it ever since . If you are confident about the water yourself and would like to teach your preschooler to swim , you probably can . Many communities also offer classes geared to this age group . This is a transitional stage , " says Shirley Reed , who teaches swimming in Athabasca , Alberta . " For younger children , I have the parents in the water with them , but for this age group the parents stay on the pool deck . And the children learn new skills that they simply could n't do as babies  --  it 's a very exciting stage . " Reed says there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to be the first priority . We start off by teaching them the rules about always walking on the pool deck , how to get into the pool and out again safely , about making sure an adult is always watching them before they go into the water , things like that . " She also uses life jackets for all her young swimmers whenever they are taken into water that is over their heads . ( It 's often a good idea to keep a life jacket on any small child who is playing near the water even if he has no intention of going in for a swim . ) Reed 's second concern is that preschoolers who are nervous about the water be helped to get over that in a gradual way . " Parents have to realize that kids are all different . One child at age three or four may be quite confident in the water and ready to swim independently or begin diving off the board . Another will be afraid to even put his face in the water . Those who are nervous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , to feel comfortable in the pool , before you can ask them to learn any new things . " Finally , she believes that swim classes should be fun . " We play a lot of games and sing - songs that help the children relax and enjoy themselves . They 're learning , and they 're getting comfortable in the water , but they just think they 're having fun and playing a game . Some parents find that even lessons designed to involve a lot of play are too structured for their children . Jill Hicksof Milton , Ontario , was able to set up an informal weekly swim program that met the needs of the families in her homeschooling community . We arranged to rent the pool at the school rate and purchase the service of the instructors - - the ratio was one instructor for every six children . The older children do a more traditional type of class , but we have a very unstructured class for the younger ones . Right now that group includes children from 14 months to seven years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents swim with their child in the group . The instructors do n't plan a lesson or any particular activities , but are there to help when asked . Says Jill , " The staff have been very flexible and supportive . " One instructor in the program comments that while she finds this approach a bit more challenging ( because she 's working with children of various ages and abilities ) she sees that the children are learning quickly and making real progress . But can classes for preschoolers really turn your four - year - old into an accomplished swimmer ? Reed expects an average four - year - old to be able to float on her stomach , turn over to a back float , swim independently for a short distance , and get in and out of the pool easily by the end of her swimming course . Some will be able to swim a length or more and dive off a low board , but those are the exceptions . Figure not transcribed She emphasizes that these accomplishments do n't mean that parents can relax their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , these skills might help children in an emergency . But they still need to be watched all the time . Even good adult swimmers can drown . " If you want to teach your preschooler to swim yourself , be prepared to spend lots of time just playing in the water . Do n't plan to give instructions . Children seem to learn to swim the same way they learn to walk or talk : by observing others and by trying things out . Your job is to provide the model they can copy , to express confidence in their ability to learn , and to make the whole experience as much fun as possible . Children this age are really eager to learn new things , " says Reed . " They feel a tremendous sense of accomplishment when they can swim a few strokes alone or even just float without anyone helping . " Personally , I ca n't think of too many better ways to spend a hot summer afternoon than splashing around in a pool with my kids . Being able to swim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one that will be a lifetime source of pleasure . <p>
