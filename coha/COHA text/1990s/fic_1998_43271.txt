Sister Rachel 's illness began the day Mrs. Levo , a parishioner , had beaten her . Mrs. Levo ' s son , Tony , had been one of the children killed in the school fire . Rachel 's upper lip had been cut , her left eye blackened , and the skin broken on her right cheek . There were bruises on her back and upper arms . Her chin , nose , and forehead were skinned from hitting the carpet , and her right wrist was sprained by the fall . It was on that night , the night after the beating , that Rachel had been found wandering through the gutted school , her garb torn away , her bodyher face , her arms , her hands-smeared with soot from the charred ruins . Although Rachel herself-because of her cure-could remember very little of the beating and nothing of the night wanderings , she had some other memory , dim , remote , glimpsed more than experienced , and it was this particular moment that she had chosen to mark the beginning of her affliction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rectory , waiting for the pastor , Father Costello . As Sister Superior of the school , she had come with a proposal that Anna Ballestrero , a graduating eighth grader , give the graduation speech instead of Father Boyd . Anna was highest in the class and Rachel thought Father Boyd , the catechist for the sixth , seventh , and eighth grades , had already said as much as he might have to say . It would be a break with tradition , but Rachel felt rather strongly that her students should be made aware that the time had come for them to begin articulating their own thoughts and feelings . And if the received education was to be praised , it would be more seemly if the praise came from one of the educated rather than from one of the educators . <p> Father Costello would oppose the suggestion ; Rachel would calmly expand upon her reasoning ; Father Costello would dismiss the suggestion ; Rachel would make a case for experiment ; Father Costello would become thoughtful in a disgruntled way ; Rachel would praise his flexibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Father Costello would continue being thoughtful , but would become less disgruntled ; Rachel would then show herself near-awed by his courage , by his singular belief in the children of his school ; Father Costello would become befuddled ; Rachel would be moved and grateful that she was allowed to serve under a man of his wisdom and daring-and would quickly leave the room before the priest could reflect on his presumed acquiescence . Waiting for Father Costello that afternoon in the rectory parlor , Rachel was looking at the picture on the far wall , above the couch . It was the Last Supper , but not by Leonardo . The general grouping was pretty much the same , everyone conveniently huddled on one side of the table , with Jesus in the middle , blessing the bread , a dark brown loaf that looked like pumpernickel . Everyone in the painting was looking at the bread except Judas and a cat . Judas was shielding his face , his cloak drawn up to his right ear , possibly to fend off the sacred words of consecration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haunches , was looking straight ahead , out of the painting , directly at Rachel . Often on other visits to the rectory Rachel had wondered what the cat was doing there , looking at her like that . Was it a joke ? Was it a homage to a wealthy patron 's prized cat ? A theological assertion that cats and all their kind were not active participants in the redemptive Eucharist taking place behind it ? A humanizing domestic inclusion ? <p> On this particular day , the cat seemed even more present than usual and Rachel felt obliged to understand at last why it was there and what it was doing . Was the cat scornful ? No . Was it impertinent ? No . Was it interested in Rachel ? Definitely not . Then why was it looking at her ? Rachel stared back , trying to seem equally indifferent , equally uninterested . Meeting on this common ground , perhaps she and the cat might come to an understanding of what was going on between the two of them . Rachel looked at the cat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinked , neither twitched . Until , of course , Rachel herself blinked , twitched , and moved her hand from her lap and stretched it out toward the painting . But she had not lost the contest ; she had won . She had understood at last . <p> The cat , sitting there , staring , was trying to prevent Rachel from looking beyond it , suggesting that she see only itself , the cat , and be distracted , even satisfied , and feel no need to see the surrender of body and of blood taking place beyond it , in the painting . The cat was there to take to itself all surmise and speculation , allowing Rachel to concentrate on its presence and its pose rather than be aghast at the abject corporeal love being offered a few feet away . <p> The cat was there to spare Rachel the sight of the young man 's invitation to make his body , his blood , a part of her own body , her own blood . The cat was there to come between Rachel and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flesh , that God at this moment was making known his wish , his command , that he participate in nature 's given course as an eaten chunk of common bread . <p> Surely this was sacrilege ; this was blasphemy . But it was true . God , creator , redeemer , had agreed , for His love 's sake , to mingle , ultimately through bread and through wine , with human waste . He was willing to become-the words from Gedney Street where she 'd grown up came rushing back before she had time to stop them : willing to become shit and piss . This man here , in the painting , blessing the bread , was the first blasphemer , and the last . He was the first to commit sacrilege , and after Him sacrilege was impossible . Nothing could be done to His flesh and His blood that could equal or surpass His own willing degradation . He had come to participate in the piss and shit of the world , and who , after Him , after this , could humiliate or defile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing could be done to Him that He himself had not already agreed to , and willingly . <p> Do not look at this blasphemer , do not witness this sacrilege : that was what the cat was saying . The cat was there as her protector . She must look at the cat and not at the young man and the pumpernickel bread . The cat would rescue her from her own disgust , from her own appalling thoughts . And from the thrill of returned love she felt at the sight of this complete submission . In mercy , the cat would come between her and this man 's act of absolute love . She would not see it . She would not know it . She would be spared . <p> Rachel had gotten up from her chair and was moving toward the painting , her hand reaching out . But what the hand was intending to touch , she did not know . Her veil brushed against a statue on the table next to the couch and knocked it down . It was the thunk of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , in stopping , she was able to hear the siren and the blared honking of a fire engine going past outside . A fire engine was a cause for curiosity , but not much more . But when the siren stopped within her hearing , she felt the first nudge of terror , slight , a quick ripple along the surface of her skin . She looked toward the window . The back end of a fire truck was visible . Two firemen were jumping down , still buckling their rubber coats . <p> She lurched toward the parlor door and caught her skirt on the arm of a chair . She ripped it free . Her elbow knocked against a lamp , then against the door jamb as she went through . Father Costello was coming down the hall toward the parlor . " Fire , " Rachel whispered . " Fire . " <p> What happened after that , the fire itself , the sixth graders trapped with young Sister Louise in the basement lunch room , Rachel 's later visits to the parents of the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember , but because of her cure , it was like something that had been written about her , that she 'd read , but had n't experienced . It might bring horror , but in a protected way . Her sympathies were real , but they were general . There would be smoke , but not the smell of smoke , fire , but no heat . The cries could be heard but they failed to stab her eardrum and pierce through into her brain . <p> Her cure , effected by electro-convulsive shock therapy , had managed to round up all these memories as if they were a marauding rabble , then consign them to an enclosed territory where they could no longer endanger her memory or overthrow her mind . They existed , and Rachel could make herself aware of them when she wanted to , but-also because of her cure-she seldom wanted to . They were a part of her history , but no longer a part of her life . <p> What had been obliterated completely , however , was Rachel 's memory of the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after she 'd been beaten by Mrs. Levo . She had been made to forget as well the afternoon three days later when , in the hospital , her brother Phillip had come to see her . The whole idea of the visit had , at the time , distressed her . She was n't sick ; she needed some rest and now that she 'd had it-for three days-she was ready to leave . She 'd also objected when told that , instead of going back to St. Michael 's , to her school and her convent , she would spend some time at the Mother House . In that instance , she had been bound by her vow of obedience , but for her brother 's visit she felt she should be free to make her own decision . Still , Dr. Zaug-precise , thoughtful Dr. Zaug-had encouraged her to see him . And Rachel had finally agreed , but only after Dr. Zaug , sitting here in her room , carefully pushing back the cuticles of his fingernails , biting off a bit of skin from around his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to be consulted about her treatment , and his permission given for the therapy they 'd prescribed . He , after all , would be paying for it . And since he 'd be there consulting with Dr. Zaug , some time with his sister should certainly be allowed . <p> After Dr. Zaug had left , taking with him the permission he 'd come to get , Rachel did nothing for a moment , she simply sat there . Then she drew her hand up and touched the bruise below her eye . She looked at the hospital gown she was wearing , then at her arms , bare from the elbow down . She saw the dark hairs hooped and curled on the skin . She looked at her unshaven legs , the hair darker than the hair on her arms , longer , making larger hoops , thickly covering her calves and shins . Rachel drew her feet back under her chair , then crossed her arms , trying with her hands to cover as much as she could of the hair . <p> After another moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come forward a little , out from under the chair . She must not be vain . She must not be too proud to let her brother see her as she was . Quiet tears came to her eyes . She let them run down her cheeks until they began dripping onto the front of her hospital gown , dampening her chest . <p> It hurt when she blotted the dresser scarf onto her cheeks and her chin . She rubbed the scarf against the gown , then held it on her lap , letting the tears come again . Again she blotted her face and scrubbed against the front of her gown . After she had let herself cry three times , she smoothed the scarf back across the top of the dresser , pushing down hard with the palm of her hand where the cloth was bunched and crinkled . She sat down again to see if the tears would come again . When they did n't , she touched the bone beneath her eye . It still hurt . <p> She looked into the mirror and stared carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Buchannan who had come to the convent one night to escape from her husband who had beaten her because , at supper , the potato he 'd put in his mouth-whole-was too hot . The eyes , receding back into the skull , were circled with black , the black leaking into purple , yellow , and green farther down the cheek . There was a lump on the upper lip where she 'd been cut by Mrs. Levo 's wedding ring and a scab was forming on her jaw . Across her forehead was a deep scratch , and some of the flesh on her left cheek was still shredded where Mrs. Levo had clawed at her with her fingernails . <p> On top of her head was a burst of cropped black hair , sticking almost straight up , except at the sides , where it sprang out over her ears . She combed her fingers through the hair , but it did no good . She tried to tuck a few strands behind the ears , but they sprang forward again as soon as she took her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see her this way . <p> When , stammering , whispering , she asked Stella , the hospital attendant , if she had something that might cover the bruises and cuts , the woman misunderstood and thought she was asking for bandages . To explain , Rachel cleared her throat and said the word make-up as clearly as she could . Stella promptly brought some " pancake , " which Rachel thought smelled like roses mixed with lard . Gently Stella did her best , spreading on a fairly thick layer that made Rachel 's face feel greasy and flushed as if she 'd been cooking something in a steaming pot . <p> When Rachel whispered " lipstick , " Stella fetched her own and again applied enough to cover the cut . She told Rachel she looked beautiful now . Rachel smiled a quick smile , opening the cut in the lip again . She touched it with her wrist to stop the blood . When she stared at the imprint the lipstick had made , she saw , wet within it , a small dot of blood , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued to stare until Stella raised her face to touch up her lips and again cover the opened wound . <p> Stella , her fingers lightly holding up Rachel 's chin , examined her handiwork . She pursed her lips , relaxed them outward , then drew them together even tighter . She tilted her head , then straightened it . She pulled back , wiped her thumb along the lower part of the right eye socket , pursed her lips again , then said , " Fine , Sister . Just fine . Ca n't see hardly a thing . " <p> " Thank you , " Rachel whispered . <p> After Stella had closed the door behind her , Rachel turned and looked at herself in the mirror . There in the glass was her likeness . Of that there could be no doubt . Except that this was not so much herself as a picture of her that might have been drawn and colored with crayons by a fourth-grader . The outline of her head had been nicely sketched , but the same crayon-orange-had been used to color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some shading where the bruises leaked through , but even they were made to seem no more than a deeper orange . And onto this surface her eyes , nose , and mouth had been drawn , forgetting her eyebrows and eyelashes altogether . The eyes were small and dark , peering out from inside the skull , as if through the openings in a Halloween mask . The nose was reduced mostly to the nostrils and even they seemed little more than round brown dots put there to show where the nose would be . Her mouth was huge . Stella had thoughtfully accommodated the cut on the upper lip , then enlarged the entire mouth to make it proportionate and perfect . <p> Rachel looked at herself for more than a few minutes . The fourthgrader , she judged , was of medium talent , with an obvious interest in lips and a fondness for the color orange . But what she saw also was a passable likeness and she must not complain . And besides , perhaps the artist , as so often happens , had seen a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the more actual Rachel whether she approved or not . Still , she allowed herself to lower the blind and turn on only the lamp on the bedstand . <p> She put on the unstarched pale green dress the hospital had provided ; the alternative would have been to wear the blue flowered gown she 'd been wearing , the one that tied in back and kept the patient prepared for bedpans , back rubs , and hypodermic needles . The green dress 's only concession to style was a pocket on the left side . It had no collar and no belt . Rachel 's neck felt bare , her waist undisciplined . She wondered what she might put into the pocket other than her hand . <p> To make herself feel less exposed , Rachel put her rosary around her neck , the crucifix resting just below her throat . She had nothing with which to cincture her waist , but into the pocket she decided to put her toothbrush , her toothpaste , and an oatmeal cookie left from lunch . This , perhaps , might prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To give some indication that she was still a nun-and to tame her obstreperous hair-she slipped the pillowcase from her pillow , placed it in a band across her forehead , drew the edges behind her , and pinned them together at the nape of her neck . Not a true veil , but it would do . <p> She had been given leather-soled brown sandals and white ankle socks , leaving her legs still bare . She considered getting into bed so she could cover herself with the blanket , but she did n't want to seem sick . She ' d just pull her feet back under the chair again . That way , her legsand the dark curling hair-might not be noticed after all . About her arms she could do nothing . She 'd already decided against a bathrobe . The arms would have to stay bare . It occurred to her that what had been teen-age vanities-her fine neck , her well-formed legs , her smooth unblemished skin , the delicate ears-were now mortifications , an embarrassment she must accept . <p> Waiting for Phillip , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , high and narrow , with a white spread designed and sewn into the crinkled and scalloped pattern of a Venetian curtain so that it could never be smoothed , nor would it appear wrinkled . There was the bedstand with the lamp . The lampshade , made of what looked like oiled parchment , had a picture of a man on a horse jumping over a high green hedge . The man was wearing a red coat and white pants , the pants stuffed into high black boots . There was a small dog , brown , longhaired , half-crouched , its bushy tail rising behind it as if the dog wanted to be a squirrel . The sky was tan . Perhaps blue would not have been masculine enough . Rachel made sure the picture side of the lampshade was facing the chair where Phillip would sit . He 'd have something to look at other than herself . To complete the decoration , Rachel stood her missal , prayer book , and a small black book of meditations in a row on the dresser . Books always made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her chair and folded her hands dutifully on her lap . She was staring at the knuckle of her right thumb , at the curved wrinkles in the skin , when she heard a light but rapid tapping on the door , as if a meeting of chipmunks was being called to order . This would be her brother Phillip . Peppy . She tried to say " come in " but her throat had dried . She swallowed three times and then the door opened , inward , a little more than half-way . <p> There , standing behind Stella , was Rachel 's father . He was even more handsome than she 'd remembered , his unruly blond hair-corncolored , really-tumbling in plumed folds down onto his ears , with one lock curling toward his left eye as if he were a movie star . His hair was longer , his nose had become leaner , his mouth more full and he had grown a mustache . He was looking at her and she could tell he was trying to smile by the way the ends of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mustache with them . <p> He had obviously come to take her home , back to the house on Gedney Street where they 'd all lived together-he and her mother and George and the baby-before he 'd drowned , and her mother , too , in the river when her mother got a cramp and her father had tried to rescue her . And now he had come to her from the land of the drowned and all their lives would begin again . <p> Her father was staring at her with wide , unblinking eyes . Maybe he could n't even see her . He was just standing there , staring . But when he finally spoke , his voice was a dry whisper , rasping along his throat . " Aggie ? " he said . <p> " No , not any more , " Rachel said . " I 'm Sister Rachel now . Ca n't you tell ? " <p> " It 's Peppy . " <p> " You 're Peppy ? " <p> " Phillip . Your brother . " <p> Rachel stared long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves , but only slightly . Yes , this would be Peppy . He was taller than their father , more perfectly formed . It was as if the infusion of their mother 's genes had effected some final refinement , the last evolutionary step from the strong and stocky peasant to the lean and muscular athlete . His eyes were dark , like his father 's , but less troubled . They seemed , as she remembered , just a little out of alignment with each other , giving them a slightly disordered look as if he was trying to avoid capture , one eye always on the look-out for an ambush that might overtake him at any moment . She must reassure him . She must comfort him . She must convince him that no harm would ever come to him , that she , Aggie , his sister , would never permit it . <p> " Peppy , yes , come in . Please . And you must sit down , in here , with me . See ? There 's the chair , just for you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sit down here , with me . " <p> Phillip moved slowly past her , careful not to touch her chair or her skirt . He sat down , put his hands on his lap , then shifted them onto his thighs , then lifted his right arm and placed it on the bed , his hand open on the spread . " I brought you some lilacs , " he said . " They 'll bring them to you . When they find a vase . So they can put them in water . " <p> Rachel nodded . When neither said anything for what seemed at least a full minute , Rachel asked , " Do I smell ? " <p> Her brother scrunched up his face . " No . Of course not . That 's not why I brought them . The lilacs You do n't smell at all . You like lilacs . They 're your favorite . " <p> " Oh . I thought maybe I smelled . I have this-on my face , on my mouth-I have this salve . " For whatever reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's salve . There was a fire . " <p> " Yes . I came when they had the funerals . Remember ? " <p> " You did ? Did I see you there ? " <p> " It is n't important . " <p> Rachel turned away . She should have remembered . She looked first at the floor near her foot , then at the light switch on the wall , then at the cord of the drawn blinds on the window . " I remember there was a fire . In the school , " she said . " That " , why I worry I might smell . That 's why I 'm here , in the hospital . No , not because I might smell , but because there was a fire . That 's why I had to come here . " She stared briefly at her brother 's hand on the bedspread , then at the floor again , then at the caster on the leg of the bed . " I 'm not burned . Not anything like that . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced at the molding along the baseboard , then at the metal brackets holding the window blind , then at her ankle , at the white sock , the sandal , the toe of her sock poking through . " Not even the smoke hurt me . I tried-I wanted-I mean , no , I 'm all right . I 'm fine . I do n't know why they sent me here . Look . My arms . Nothing . My legs even . That 's why I wear these clothes . So everyone can see . Do you see anything burned ? " <p> " No . But you face , near your eye- " <p> " It 's the salve . That 's all it is . Salve . " <p> One inch at a time , Rachel leaned back in the chair until her shoulder blades touched the wood . Her upper torso sprang forward , but she caught herself , then slowly leaned back again , this time allowing the wood to touch her . " See ? I 'm fine . " <p> " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He lowered his head , then turned and looked toward the window . " I wonder when they 'll bring the lilacs . " <p> " They have to find a vase . " <p> " Yes . " <p> They were both looking at the drawn blind , Rachel at the lower slats , Phillip at the cord . Then Phillip looked down at his hand on the bedspread . He rubbed the hand back and forth , like a blind man trying to erase a message he 'd just read in braille . <p> " It 's wonderful here though , " Rachel said . " They 're so good , the way they care for you . I mean , me . " <p> " Good . I 'm glad . " <p> " They let you sleep as long as you want . It does n't even bother them . You can sleep half the morning , they do n't care . And the food , you can eat it or not eat it . They do n't care about that either . Maybe a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't really care . You can stand or sit , kneel or lie down . They let you . No difference at all . You can keep quiet or , if you want to , you can scream . Yes . Scream . Here . I 'll show you . " <p> Twice she screamed , her mouth distorted and pulled taut , her eyes slitted and terrified . Her whole body rose and fell ; it expanded and contracted with each sound as if she were trying to empty herself completely of all breath , of all strength . <p> " Do n't . Please , do n't . You 'll hurt yourself . " Phillip reached over and touched the tips of his fingers lightly on the back of her hand . <p> " See ? They let you if you want to . Would you like me to do it again ? " <p> " No . No , it 's all right . " <p> " I scared you did n't I ? I did n't mean to . Why would I do that ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . Even if I scream . " She began to open her mouth , readying herself to do it again . Phillip held out his hand toward her . Slowly she closed her mouth and slowly Phillip lowered his hand and let it rest just above his knee . He had straight , thin creases in his pants legs ; they were so neatly pressed . It was a suit he was wearing , and a tie too . His hand was big and strong . <p> " They-Dr . Zaug actually- " Phillip said , " Dr. Zaug says they have a-a procedure-a procedure is what they call it-a procedure here that can make you better . A treatment . You 're going to have it , a whole series , beginning tomorrow , if I give permission . It wo n't hurt . You wo n't feel it at all . And it 'll help you get better . Is that all right with you ? " <p> " I am better . I 'm always better after I scream . " " But after they give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes I will . I 'll always have to scream . Nothing can change that . " <p> " It 'll make it so you wo n't even want to scream . " <p> " Oh no . Please . Please , do n't let them take away my screams . I need them . I ca n't be without them . I do n't know what I 'd do if I thought they would n't be there when I need them . Please , do n't let them . Believe me , I have to have them . Please- ! " <p> " But you scream because you 're in pain . They 'll take away the pain . " <p> " I 'm not in pain . Really I 'm not . It 's just-just that I 'm so-lost . " <p> " Lost ? " <p> " No , not me lost . The children lost . I could n't find them . I knew they 'd been there . I heard them , yelling , calling me . That 's why I scream . To answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , even if I ca n't find them . " <p> " This will all be over-soon . Very soon . I 'll tell Dr. Zaug it 's all right to-I 'll give him my permission to- " <p> " No , do n't tell the doctor anything . Do n't tell him to do anything . I know what to do . I 'll go there again and again . To the school . And you must n't worry about me . I 'm all right there . All the fires are out . Dead . Even the fires . Dead . " <p> " Yes , I know , but- " <p> " No , you do n't know ! Because you 've never been there . And neither have I. They 're the only ones who 've been there . " She looked up quickly , frightened , staring at him . " You have n't been there , have you ? Tell me . You haven't- " She put her arm across her eyes as if to protect them , to keep them from seeing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stones . " Her voice was toneless as if she were too emptied to give her words inflection . " Everything black . Everything cold . And no one there . I put my hands , my face , against the stones , against the burned wood . I broke off chunks of smoke , to eat it . I ate as much as I could , pushing it , shoving it into my mouth , but I could n't swallow any more . It spilled out , all over me . It got my clothes dirty , the smoke I could n't eat . My clothes , they were all dirty . " <p> Phillip lowered his head . His hair fell forward , over his eyes . He did n't move . " Do n't , Aggie . Please . " <p> Rachel took her arm from in front of her eyes and looked at her brother . " Do you want to leave ? " she asked . Phillip shook his head no without looking up . " I can be alone , " Rachel said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have to get used to it . " <p> Phillip lifted his head , but did n't brush the hair from his forehead , from his eyes . His mouth began to open , but he closed it , shook his head , lowered it , then shook it again . " You 're not alone , Aggie . I 'm here . " <p> Rachel seemed not to have heard . " So I took off my clothes , " she continued . " They were all dirty with smoke . I loved my clothes . They were precious to me . They were my life . But I must n't wear them , not any more . I did n't deserve them . So I took them off . I tried not to cry , but my tears made my hands all wet and the black soot , the smoke was smeared all over me . I took them-my clothes-all off . They were so beautiful . I laid them on a stone , near a black window that was broken . Gently , gently , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears on the hem of my veil , but I knew I must n't touch it , any of it , my good , good , my dear , dear-My veil . My lovely , lovely veil- " <p> Rachel stopped and smoothed her hospital dress down over her knees . " I left them there . It was so cold . I used the dried smoke to cover me . That would be my clothes . Smoke . Only smoke . " She pressed her spread fingers across her forehead , forming a cage for her eyes . It was then that she heard the gagging sound . Her brother had thrown back his head , his eyes staring at the ceiling . His jaw was moving up and down , caught in a spasm . Then the scream came , but he stopped it before it could finish , before it could escape completely . Still gagging , he swallowed the scream , forcing it , gulp by gulp , back down , as if he wanted to swallow his throat . <p> Rachel took the spread fingers away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " We can both scream . Shall we ? The two of us , together ? " <p> " No . Please . " His voice was firm but low . He started to say something more and to reach out : his hand , but stopped himself when the hand was no more than a few inches from his knee . He raised his head and drew the skin of his face taut , back toward his ears . His mouth was rigid , his eyes slightly hooded as if he were looking down at her from a great height . He stood up , smoothed the arms of his suit , then hunched his shoulders and let them drop , just to make sure his clothes were in place . " The treatment will help , " he said . " The doctor promised . " <p> Rachel , too , had stood up . " You 're going ? So soon ? " <p> " I told Dr. Zaug I 'd come to his office in half an hour . It 's close to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to tell you . " <p> " What things ? " <p> " I do n't know . But there must be something . " <p> " Next time . " <p> Rachel waited a moment , then nodded her head . " Next time . " After the second nod , she did n't raise her head . Phillip had opened the door and was standing there . She leaned her head toward him and looked desperately at his necktie , just below the knot , as if it were a microphone into which she must speak if she hoped to be heard . " When you pray , " she said , " pray that there will be no fire . Please . Ask God that the fire must n't happen , that the-the children , that they 'll be safe . That no harm will come to them , that they must n't be frightened and they must n't choke , they must n't die . Please . Pray . Never the fire . Can you do that ? " <p> " Aggie , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fire is over . It happened and nothing can change that . Not even God . You ca n't pray that it wo n't happen when it 's happened already . So stop it . Just stop it . " <p> " No ! I wo n't stop it . We must n't say only those prayers that can be answered . We must say those that ca n't . Those that are impossible . Always . And we must pray them more fervently because they are impossible . Do it , Peppy . Do it . Forget that it can never be answered . Just do it . Promise me . Please promise me !
