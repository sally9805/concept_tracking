Did you ever hear of a house that pretended it was a cuckoo clock ? Probably not , for this story happened a long , long time ago , during the Revolutionary War . It was a very dignified house that played this trick and one that you would never suspect of such nonsense-the village inn-but of course , the house might never have done anything at all if it had not been for two young patriots , Ruth and Dan Brownley , the children of the innkeeper . The Brownley Inn was a delightful place for anyone to live . Down by the road hung the great sign which gave the inn its name , the Colonial Arms . An artist had come from New York just to paint that sign and had worked many days upon it . On one side was a beautiful picture of the Goddess of Liberty for whom the colonies were fighting . On the other side was a great chain , made of thirteen links , and in each link , a pine tree , a spreading maple , or graceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colonies . Dan and Ruth thought that it was the most beautiful picture they had ever seen and they loved it dearly . It represented the dear country which they were so eager to serve . The house itself was built of small brown bricks which had been brought from England more than a century before and which looked as though they could tell dozens of interesting stories if one could only understand brick language . And the tiny square panes of glass in the windows had been washed by so many rains and snows that they had caught all the colors of the rainbow and shone like mother-of-pearl in the sunlight . Up in the gable , above the front door , was a window of colored glass , shaped like a fan , and below it were two shutters . The shutters looked so much like the doors of the cuckoo clock down in the hall that Ruth and Dan often wondered why they never opened and let out a jolly little bird to call the hours . That is where this story really begins , for when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it often does , you know . As I told you before , this all happened during the Revolutionary War . The inn was not far from the camps of both the British and American troops and sometimes , when there was a battle , the children could hear the Boom ! Boom ! of the great guns and even the Rat-tat-tat ! of the muskets . And , of course , the soldiers from both camps often stopped at the inn . One day there was a great deal of company in the house-great , tired-looking men they were , with muddy boots and heavy pistols , who came through the orchard at the back of the house . The children knew they were officers in the American army by the way they were hurried into a secret room and served with the best meal Mrs. Brownley could supply . Ruth and Dan were all eyes and ears and got in everyone 's way without meaning to . They loved these men dearly who were fighting for their country , and they wanted to ask dozens and dozens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men had no time for young people just then , and so to their disappointment , she soon sent them to the attic to play . " Let 's have a game of hopscotch , " suggested Dan to fill the time . " I have the squares all marked out with red and blue and white . We can name them Trenton and Princeton and Morristown and other battle towns and surprise the enemy just the way Washington does . " " That would be fun , " answered Ruth , " but I 'm afraid that our poor soldiers are hungry . I think I 'd better bake some pies and cakes and things for them . " She had brought some brown and white sand from the seashore the summer before , which made delicious-looking food , and her father had made her a set of pewter pans almost like her mother 's , so Ruth was very proud of her sand cooking . Before long , Dan became very hot while playing soldier and decided to open the shutters of the cuckoo window . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his surprise he saw a group of soldiers riding along the road to the inn . He knew they were British officers by their red coats and gold decorations . They stopped when they saw the bright new sign and began to discuss its meaning . Then , to Dan 's horror , they lifted their muskets and aimed at it and he heard one cry , " It 's a traitorous sign and should be shot down ! I 'll wager you a shining sovereign , Sir Captain , that you 'll miss the tip of yonder pine tree at a hundred paces . " " Do n't scatter your gold abroad so recklessly , friend Hal , " answered his companion . " I 'll double your wager and win your pocket piece . " Bang ! Bang ! went the first musket . Bang ! answered the second . " Hit the bull 's eye that time , " commented the captain , " but " t was only chance . I 'll match you again . Since we have missed those Yankee plotters , we have bullets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , but this time Dan had no ears for the shots . All of a sudden , he realized that these men were hunting for the weary , mud-spattered patriots downstairs and in a minute would be in the inn ! " Ruthie , Ruthie , " he called to his sister , " run downstairs and tell Father some British soldiers are out in the road in front of the inn . They are looking for the Americans who are meeting here . Run , Ruthie ! Run as fast as you can , while I stay here and try to keep them out of the house . " Ruthie was not a very big girl , but she understood that she might save the lives of the brave soldiers downstairs if she ran fast enough . Before Dan had finished , she was halfway to the stairs . A minute later , she was knocking at the door of the secret room . Photograph <p> Dan sighed with relief as he heard the door open , and turned back to the little window . There he saw that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defacing his beautiful sign , had dismounted and were idly making their way up the walk to the inn . Something must be done at once to give the Americans more time to get away , and Dan knew that he was the only person who could do it . Suddenly a plan popped into his head . He and Ruth had often played tricks on their friends by calling to them when they saw them passing along the road . Perhaps if he pretended he was a cuckoo bird , the men would stop at least for a minute to laugh at him . That would give the colonial soldiers time to escape through the orchard , to the road half a mile away which led to headquarters and safety . Dan longed to look out of the window at the back of the attic to watch them riding away , but he was a soldier on picket duty and he knew that he must stick to his post . While he had been doing all this thinking , he had also been acting . He ran to the corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped there , and stuck it on his head . Then , when he thought the soldiers would see him , he flung open the little doors and called loudly , " Cuckoo , cuckoo , cuckoo ! " and bobbed up and down like the wooden cuckoo bird in the clock . He was a comical enough figure for anyone to laugh at and the fun-loving young Englishmen were more than glad to be amused . " A strange bird , but a merry one ! " cried one . " He wears King George 's colors on his head . Perhaps he 'll sing again . Come , Cuckoo ! " And they laughed again . Dan would gladly have snatched off the red cap when he heard that remark , but he knew that this was no time to be particular . Again he swung open the little doors , and cried out , " Cuckoo ! Cuckoo ! " " By King George , the hour grows earlier instead of later , according to this bird . Come now , Cuckoo , sing again and let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called out another soldier . This was a funny game after all , decided Dan , and flung open the shutters . He tried to call twelve times but choked on his laughter and had to stop at six . While Dan went for a drink , Ruth , who had returned from her errand , took his place at the window . Photograph <p> " Oh , Dan , " she cried a minute later . " I believe the redcoats are going around to the back of the house . Maybe they will see the horses " tracks in the orchard and follow our American friends ! " Dan forgot his cough at this new danger . Something must be done at once to keep the British at the front of the inn . He looked around at the pleasant attic with its rafters festooned with strings of fragrant apples , onions , and red peppers ; at the leathercovered trunks , and piles of furniture waiting to be mended . Then he caught sight of his grandfather 's fife and a homemade drum with which he and Ruth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Ruth , " This cuckoo clock plays tunes as well as calls the hour . You keep time on the old drum the way Drummer Thompson does when he marches at the head of the soldiers and I 'll play Yankee Doodle . " " " Hooray ! " answered Ruth , and ran for the drum . And then , because they could keep time better when they were walking , they began to march " round and round the big attic to the jolly old tune . Now if there was any tune which the British did not like , it was " Yankee Doodle . " It was such a brave little tune which seemed to snap its fingers in their very faces . Then , too , they had heard it many times before hard-fought battles which they did n't like to think about . So , as soon as they caught the first notes , they stopped short and ran back to the road , ready to mount their horses and ride away . But , to their surprise , there were no Yankees to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the road . Still no signs of the enemy , although the tune marched on and on . The captain returned to the inn to peer in the windows . Finally , he called out , " The Yankees are in the house ! I can hear them drilling in the attic . After me ! " He flung open the front door and led the way up the stairs three steps at a bound . But , when he at last reached the big , empty attic , he stopped , bewildered . The tune had stopped at last and the " enemy " stood white and frightened in the middle of the floor . " Where 's the rest ? " he asked Dan . " Please , sir , there are n't any more , " answered Dan , shaking a little because he did n't know what soldiers did to boys who played tricks on them . " Nobody but Ruthie and me . " Photograph <p> But the big Englishman did n't do anything . He called to his men with a big laugh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cuckoo bird-two of themhaving a little dress parade all alone . " Mr. Brownley came up just in time to join in the festive time which followed and soon they all went down to enjoy the feast which Mrs. Brownley and old Nancy had prepared . When at last the British left the hospitable table , they asked whether anyone had seen a score or more of Yankees who were said to be holding a conference some place near . Strange to say , no one in that house had any information to give them . The British never knew that they had been tricked out of their prey when it was almost within their grasp by the quick wit of a boy scarcely nine years old . But Washington and his generals heard the whole story , and not long after , Dan and Ruth were invited to camp to be thanked by the great general himself . Of course , Ruthie had a new red cap for the occasion , and the soldiers begged so hard to hear the story that Dan borrowed the cap and bobbed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " until the men roared with laughter . But , when at last the children said goodbye and rode through the camp on their way home , every soldier saluted them with real respect . It was as though they were saying , " You , too , are soldiers , working for the freedom of America . "
