For Helene Wilson , the decision to participate in a clinical trial of tamoxifen took no thought at all . Scientists at the National Cancer Institute and the National Institutes of Health wanted to know if the drug , used for 25 years to treat breast cancer , could prevent the disease . The question was of more than academic interest to Wilson , 48 , a North Wales , Pa. , nurse and mother of two . Four close relatives , including her mother and grandmother , had died of breast cancer at an early age . Wilson herself had a history of benign lumps in her breast . She was , her doctor once bluntly told her , " a walking time bomb . " <P> Perhaps now she has been defused . Last week researchers announced that they were halting the study 13 months early . Reason : tamoxifen , they 've learned , does indeed prevent breast cancer . It 's the first drug ever shown to do so . Said Dr. Harold Varmus , director of the NIH , in announcing the results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More of a big deal than he 'd expected , perhaps . Although Varmus and other officials were careful to stress that tamoxifen is a potentially deadly drug with serious risks and unpleasant side effects , that message was all but lost in the initial euphoria . Breast cancer justifiably terrifies American women  --  so badly that many latched on to the discovery and ignored the downside . <P> It did n't take long for the backlash to begin . Breast-cancer support groups weighed in almost at once . Why , they asked , would an otherwise healthy woman want to take a drug that can cause birth defects , trigger blood clots and double her chance of getting cancer of the uterus ? Some questioned the drug 's value even for the 29 million American women whose chances of getting breast cancer are , like Helene Wilson 's , significantly higher than the 1-in-9 national average . Tamoxifen is already approved as a breast-cancer treatment , so physicians can prescribe it for prevention as well . But , says Fran Visco , president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's not the prevention that we 've all been demanding . " <P> It was those demands in the late 1980s that made University of Pittsburgh surgeon Dr. Bernard Fisher and others take a second look at tamoxifen , which had been in use for a decade as a milder alternative to chemotherapy for treating breast cancer . They noticed that it not only helped keep cancer from returning in the affected breast but also cut in half the number of new cancers in the other breast . Animal studies suggested that tamoxifen latches on to receptors in breast-cancer cells that would ordinarily take up the hormone estrogen  --  a substance known to fuel the growth of cancer . By keeping the estrogen out , tamoxifen essentially cuts off the cancer cells ' fuel supply . <P> That being the case , Fisher and other researchers wondered whether this cell-starvation process could prevent breast cancer from taking hold in the first place . Thus in 1992 they began the federally funded , 13,388-participant , $50 million study of women at especially high risk ; being over 60 was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had a combination of two or more close relatives who had had the disease , a first child late in life , and several previous biopsies of suspicious lumps .
