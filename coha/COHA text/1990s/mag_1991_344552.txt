Combat . If one noun sums up Tom Harkin 's political program and persona , it is combat . The Iowa Democrat proudly describes the strategy that won him five terms in the House and two in the Senate : " Always attack , never defend . " He believes that a pugnacity gap kept Democrats out of the White House through the ' 80s . Now , as he runs for President , he proposes to fill that gap by waging class warfare against George Bush and guerrilla operations against Democrats he considers timid . " The only thing Americans like less than a dirty fighter , " he says , " is someone who wo n't fight back . " <P> He is hardly waiting for an excuse to counterpunch . For months Harkin , 51 , prepared for his formal announcement of candidacy last weekend by conducting the kind of aggressive populist campaign at which he excels . When he castigates the Reagan and Bush administrations for favoring the rich and harming the less affluent , he sings from the standard party hymnal . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of roots and resentment . He is the son of a Slovene immigrant mother who died young and an Iowan coal miner who never got to high school . In attacking the patrician President he keenly dislikes , Harkin can make the incumbent 's very name sound odious . <P> " I 've got news for you , George . . . Herbert . . . Walker . . . Bush , " he says , jabbing his forefinger in the air . " Next year the American working people are going to veto you ! " Lines like that evoke applause from blue- collar workers , farmers and party activists . So does Harkin 's hectoring of new-wave Democrats who would move the party toward the center . Virginia Governor Douglas Wilder , who became a candidate on Friday , glories in his record of fiscal austerity . Paul Tsongas , the earliest aspirant , styles himself a pro-business Democrat . Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton , still mulling a run , comes across as a middle-roader . Of Harkin 's rivals , actual or potential , only Nebraska Senator Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> For now , Harkin is the preacher of traditional liberal psalms : a massive public-works scheme , increased spending for education and health , lower taxes for the working class and higher levies on the affluent . He promises " a bold plan for a new economic structure . " But many Americans long ago lost faith in such primordial liberalism . Nathan Landow , Maryland party chairman and a major campaign fund raiser , concedes that Harkin 's record could turn off wealthy contributors , not to mention moderate voters . " But Tom has a fiery way about him that will catch on , " Landow says . " Maybe this time we need the messenger and can relax a little about the message . " <P> Harkin 's Senate colleagues last week were anything but relaxed as he irked them with one of his guerrilla maneuvers . As chairman of an appropriations subcommittee , he proposed moving $3 billion from the Defense Department to popular education and health programs . That would violate the constraints in the 1990 deficit-reduction compromise reached after much anguish , but Harkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After an afternoon of contentious debate , Harkin lost by a vote of 69 to 28 , as he knew he would . But among liberal political junkies who vote in primaries , he scored points .
