Nearly eight months after the body of JonBenet Ramsey was found by her father in the basement of the family 's home in Boulder , Colo. , local authorities , under a district court order , last week released the full autopsy report on the murdered little girl . Anyone who had predicted last Dec. 26 , when a ransom note found by JonBenet 's mother turned later in the day into a homicide investigation , that the big news about the case in August would be the grudging release of the autopsy would have been called crazy . What , no arrests , charges , indictments , trial ? But , as last week 's development underscored , the snail 's pace of the JonBenet Ramsey murder case continues to defy reasonable expectations . <P> Boulder authorities , in trying to keep the complete autopsy report under wraps , argued in successive courts that releasing it would publicize details known only to the killer or killers of JonBenet , thereby compromising the ongoing criminal investigation . ( Some states ban the preliminary release of autopsy reports for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) But the findings made public last week seemed more heartbreaking than harmful . <P> A number of grisly details were familiar from earlier , partial autopsy reports . The child had been garroted  --  a noose twisted tightly about her neck with a stick  --  and her skull had been fractured . Other findings were new . When she died , JonBenet had a red-ink drawing of a heart in the palm of her left hand . Her blond hair was done up in two ponytails , leading some observers to speculate that she had never gone to bed that Christmas night . She had a yellow metal bracelet on her right wrist with the inscription " JonBenet " and the date " 12/25/96 , " presumably a Christmas gift that also marked the last day she was seen alive . She wore long underwear over her white panties . Both of these garments revealed traces of urine  --  a common physiological response to strangulation  --  and the panties bore what the autopsy called " several red areas of staining , " presumed to be blood and perhaps indicative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier impressions that the killer was familiar with the Ramsey house and had plenty of time to commit the murder , it offered no fresh insight into who might have killed the prepubescent beauty queen . Boulder County coroner John Meyer did not even estimate the time of death . But that did not stop the Ramseys ' attorney , Hal Haddon , from weighing in with one of the first opinions on the report . " The autopsy details released today confirm what we have known for some time , " he said in a statement , " that this vicious murder was well planned . " <P> John and Patsy Ramsey are still a main focus of the investigation , but they are also becoming its highly publicized investigators . According to Haddon , the Ramseys ' privately financed team involves upwards of 20 people , with four full-time private investigators and 10 forensics experts , including several handwriting analysts and a linguist . On Sunday , moreover , the Ramseys ran their fourth local newspaper ad appealing for help from the public . The ad noted that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrases from them " and included quotes from Ransom , Dirty Harry and Speed that the family says are similar to ones in the bogus ransom note .
