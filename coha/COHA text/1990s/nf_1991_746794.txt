Section : SCIENCE LITE I told you I needed black socks <p> I knew that I had been accepted into the Omaha Indian community the evening I was with some Omaha friends and the topic of conversation was why white people smell funny . ( The conclusion was that stinky stuff gets stuck in all those body hairs . ) On such occasions I learn a lot about Omaha culture , but more importantly , I learn about my own white , mainstream , lower-middle-class culture . The Omahas never ask me for explanations of why my people do the things they do , and I 'm glad they do n't , because I do n't have many answers . <p> The Omahas talk about white people 's preoccupation with time and money , inability to sense even the most obvious workings of the gods , difficulty in conducting meaningful conversations ( even within their own families ) , and lack of understanding about ... well , about almost everything . They are n't angry or bitter or cynical or mocking ; they just ca n't figure white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Omahas talk a lot about the mainstream 's system of giving , especially the custom of " exchanging " gifts . Actually , they do n't so much talk about it as shake their heads in incomprehension over the calculated reciprocity involved . The Omahas give gifts and conduct trade , but they never confuse the two . If an Omaha gives a gift worth thirty dollars or so ( a blanket , for example ) , the recipient has to be careful not to give that person something worth thirty dollars anytime soon . Otherwise he risks giving the impression of turning the gift into a purchase . <p> The amount of time that must be allowed to pass is a subjective determination but depends roughly on the value of the gift  --  maybe three or four months for a blanket . A fifty-dollar saddle requires longer to fade from community memory , perhaps a half year . A cow takes forever . Since gift giving is an important part of Omaha culture  --  the means by which one acquires prestige and status within the community  --  mental computing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The mainstream 's concentration is the opposite : " Last year was the third year in a row your cheapskate cousin in Des Moines did n't send us a card , and this year she is off the list ! " Imagine being a part of a society in which you avoid equity while living in the midst of a culture that insists on it ! <p> Or consider the common mainstream family practice of " deciding what we 'll spend this year " : " Okay , this Christmas we 'll give Mom and Dad gifts worth no more than $25 , brothers and sisters items worth no more than $15 , nieces and nephews $5.50 , aunts and uncles $17.76 , pets $3.36 , except goldfish , for which gifts will not exceed $2 , not including sales tax . " ( In a pre-Christmas family briefing  --  fresh , I suspect , from an Indian gathering  --  I once rashly suggested that we give whatever gifts we considered appropriate . I 'm no longer a part of that family . ) <p> As if that were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than receive . ( Lord only knows where they got that idea . ) And that includes giving what has already been given , perhaps the source of the idiom " Indian giver . " Among the Omahas , food is a particularly respectful gift , so once , when I wanted to do something nice for an Omaha friend , I put together a big basket of fresh fruit , sausages , cheese , lots of yummies . I gave the basket to my friend at a public gathering of the Omaha Indian community . <p> We mainstreamers consider wealth and acquisition to be important , so we make wealth and acquisition public  --  big cars , swimming pools , silk suits , nose bobs , right out there where everyone can see them . Because the Omahas consider giving to be important , they make it public . Gifts are given at powwows , prayer meetings , hand games , gourd dances , wherever there 's a crowd . And they are announced by a crier , who loudly proclaims and compliments their value and importance . <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crier , who announced the gift amid a hubbub of approval . My friend came forward with tears in his eyes and accepted my gift . He embraced me and called me " cousin . " But before I even had time to turn from the crier and return to my seat , my friend stepped to someone else in the room  --  someone I scarcely knew  --  and gave her the basket I had put such effort into . Well , great . My gift apparently meant no more to my friend than an extra set of shoelaces . <p> Later I found out that the standard monologue in our society  --  " Oh , my goodness , what a wonderful rhinestone aspirin locket ! I 've been wanting one for so long ! I 'm going to wear this to church tomorrow ... no , I wo n't ! I 'm going to save this for special occasions like meeting the queen ; and I 'll call my lawyer next week to be sure that when I die it goes to my oldest granddaughter for her dowry "  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having , is important . The Omaha formula in the same situation would be , " This is such a wonderful gift , I would be proud to give it away myself . In fact , I think I will . Here and now . " I have seen gifts so important that they were given away three times on the same occasion . <p> It gets worse  --  or better , depending on how willing you are to pursue Omaha logic . When I was given my Omaha name in 1967 , I knew it was proper for me to put together a feast and give gifts , so I asked an old friend , " How much food should I prepare ? How many gifts should I bring ? " I knew there would be four or five hundred people at the gathering , so I was prepared for a jolt , but not quite for the one I got . <p> My friend said , " This is an important occasion for you . " <p> " About the most important thing that has ever happened to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have . " <p> " Uh , everything I have ? " <p> " Everything . " <p> I spent quite a bit , but Indian name or not , I did n't spend everything I had . There 's still a lot of German blood in these veins . <p> Even before the Omaha Tribe wrenched my understanding of gift-giving protocol , my mother gave me reason to wonder . Every year in mid-September she asks for a list of what my wife , daughter , and I want for Christmas . We give her the list and then she gets us something else . <p> " Mom , " I say annually , staring with bewilderment at a package of a dozen of those undershirts with little , thin straps that go over your shoulders and which I never wear , " I told you I needed black socks . " <p> " I wo n't buy you any more black socks . " <p> " But I need black socks . " <p> " Christmas is n't a time for giving things we need . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thin shoulder straps ? I do n't wear undershirts with little , thin shoulder straps . " <p> " See ? It 's not something you need , and at Christmas you 're not supposed to give things people need . " <p> Part of the problem with the American system of gift giving may lie within the nature of our gifts . My son gives me presents he thinks will improve my mind , which is nice , but I ca n't help wondering why he thinks my mind needs improvement . I do n't know where my wife gets her ideas for gifts . It 's as if she 's never met me . Last year she gave me a pair of boxing gloves . In all fairness , she maintains she is equally mystified by the fruit-drying oven I gave her . <p> I blamed the fruit-drying oven error on a high-pressure salesman . Charles Kuralt , as usual , says it best : " We call gift shops gift shops because they sell things we 'd never buy for ourselves . " <p> No one can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a good arrangement for Christmas gifts : we exchange screwdrivers . Family legend has it that the screwdriver tradition started when I was a little boy and about all I could think of by way of a Christmas gift for Dad , and all I could afford , was a screwdriver . Every year a screwdriver . When I became an adult , Dad returned the favor , and that 's what we do every year now . <p> Dad 's gift is my favorite . I know it 's a screwdriver but I never know what kind , and there are lots of kinds of screwdrivers . Besides , not a year passes during which I do n't lose my Christmas screwdriver from Dad , so I am always in need of another , no matter what kind it is . ( On the other hand , Dad never loses anything  --  so his basement is full of screwdrivers . ) <p> The situation gets even more confusing if we turn our analysis of gift giving to children . The reality is that in the case of children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operates within another logic . Everyone sees the truth annually and comments on it : the boxes the gifts come in seem to be more fun for the children than the gifts . Why ? Because the boxes are more fun than the gifts that come in them . <p> Even more fun than the gifts that come in the boxes or the boxes they come in are the gifts the other kid gets and the boxes they come in . ( This insight has a much broader application than Christmas gifts and will eventually make someone rich . Market toys as " The Other Kid 's Toys " and the money will roll in , trust me . ) <p> Far be it from me , however , to point out the faults of the world without offering a clear plan for fixing them . All we have to do is mix everything together  --  Indian ideas , kid stuff , mothers ' problems with buying socks , screwdrivers  --  and everything will work out fine . <p> Here 's what I propose : This year give your friends and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things they already have and like or that you already have and like . Ignore your family 's agreement about spending limits . Give presents to the wrong people and invite them to make exchanges on the spot , which means everyone will get two presents instead of one and will wind up with something they like . ( I do n't know how Linda feels about boxing gloves , but I sure could use the fruit-drying oven . ) Tell each recipient of a gift out loud , and publicly , how you arrived at your decision . If you ca n't imagine why you are giving what you 're giving , it 's a bad idea anyway . Maybe once your friends and family hear your explanation , they 'll like your gifts . Above all , put presents in interesting boxes . That 'll make everyone happy . <p> Me , I 'm giving everyone indoor mushroom gardens this year . Do n't ask me why . <p> By Roger L.
