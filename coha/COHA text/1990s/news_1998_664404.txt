Only fair numbers of bulls should be available in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bear populations appear to be healthy judging by incidental sightings and damage complaints . Look for bears in abandoned orchards or other food sources in the early mornings or late evenings . <p> Cougar : Predator calls are about the most effective way to hunt these secretive animals . Look for rocky outcroppings in heavily forested areas . <p> Waterfowl : More migrants are moving into north coast estuaries . Estuary hunts are largely tide-dependant ; check the tide tables for your area as you plan your hunt . <p> Upland Birds : Mountain quail , ruffed and blue grouse should provide a fair hunting opportunity this Fall . Mountain quail are often seen in brushy clear cuts , especially on south facing slopes . Ruffed grouse are usually associated with riparian areas or blocked logging roads with good food crops . Blue grouse tend to be found in higher areas like ridges near timber/opening edges . Brush rabbits can be seen along grassy edges of logging roads . <p> Mid-Coast District <p> Upland Birds : Grouse and mountain quail are widely scattered in forest habitat and hunting is only fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are expected to have a very good season . Early migrants have already been observed on coastal bays and in the Willamette Valley . <p> Big Game : Coastal range deer hunting conditions have been very good , and success is expected to increase in the latter half of the season . The normal pattern of leaf fall , fall storms and deer rutting behavior makes the last half of the black-tailed season the best opportunity for hunters . <p> Salem District <p> Deer : The season remains open through Nov. 11 . Hunting conditions are good , with hunter success expected to improve through the end of the season . <p> Goose identification testing sessions for the Northwest Oregon Goose Zone will be held this month . Refer to page 30 on the Game Bird Regulations for dates and times . <p> Duck and goose general seasons are open . There are good numbers of birds in the flyway this year .

There was good production this year , with many young birds being seen . <p> Lane District <p> Bear : Hunting success continues steady . With cooler weather conditions , bear should become more active and hunter success should increase . Hunters are reminded they need to turn in a tooth for aging upon taking a bear . <p> Cougar : General cougar season is open . <p> Deer : Deer harvest is expected to increase as leaves drop and weather conditions improve . Good production and a mild winter last year should give hunters good prospects for deer harvest .

Consult your regulations for times , dates and places . <p> ( More ) <p> Douglas District <p> Upland birds : For mountain quail , good nesting success this spring has provided excellent hunting opportunities this fall . However , hunting pressure so far this season has made birds wary and hunting is becoming more difficult . Best opportunities are at mid level elevations near brushy areas close to good timber stands .

Much of the hunting is on private property where permission must be obtained before hunting . <p> Elk : Good bull carry over last year should make this year 's bull elk season a little better than average . Elk are widely dispersed and hunters who have taken the time to scout out their hunting area should have the best chance at success . Hunters are reminded that the Tioga and Powers units are limited entry and only those with tags for these areas can hunt there . Also , the Department has initiated a tooth collection effort to document the age of the harvested bulls in all of western Oregon . Successful hunters are asked to contact one of the local ODFW offices to obtain a tooth envelope . <p> Bear : Numbers are very good .

Many are being reported at lower elevations feeding on acorns and fallen fruit . <p> Upland birds : Grouse and Mt . Quail populations are excellent this year , but birds are beginning to disperse away from creeks with the arrival of fall rains . <p> Denman Wildlife Area : Pheasant hunting has been slow , but some roosters remain on the area . Flooding of the fields has begun and waterfowl hunting should improve as birds move into the valley . <p> South Coast District <p> Bear : The bear population on the south coast continues to increase . Hunters can have good success if they can find an area where bears have been feeding . <p> Upland Birds : Quail and grouse numbers remain at higher than average levels with some very late broods this year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waterfowl : Ducks have been slow to migrate into the south coast so far this season .

Hunting conditions are excellent . <p> Coyotes : Good numbers continue to be available throughout the district . <p> Waterfowl : Duck and goose populations are good with scattered distributions . Opportunity will decline as open water freezes . <p> Jackrabbits : Numbers are low throughout the district . Best success will be adjacent to agricultural lands .

Possibilities include BLM and Crooked River National Grassland lands along the Deschutes and Crooked Rivers . <p> Valley Quail : Production was fair to excellent , with a strong late hatch . The birds are widely distributed and usually present near wet areas which have good cover conditions . This includes BLM , Crooked River National Grasslands , and private agricultural lands .

Valley quail numbers have been high throughout lower elevation agricultural lands . Hunters should remember to ask for permission prior to hunting on private land . <p> Waterfowl : Small ponds are starting to freeze over . Unless temperatures moderate , this will have a big impact on waterfowl and may force them to either head for larger bodies of water or migrate south into California . If weather conditions continue to be very cold , look for goose hunting to start improving on fields surrounding agricultural lands . <p> EASTERN OREGON <p> Grant District <p> Elk : Opening weekend success for second season hunters was fair .

The majority of quail populations occur on agricultural lands which are privately owned .

Elk were concentrated in the more secluded areas and heavy cover areas . <p> Pheasant : Production in the Heppner District was generally poor this year and hunting has been relatively slow .

Some birds are being harvested by big game hunters . <p> Quail : Production this year was average and hunting success is reflecting relatively good production in the better habitat areas . This is especially true in the low elevation areas with good cover . Foothill populations are sparse and tend to be located around farm houses where hunting is not allowed . Hunters are reminded to have permission before hunting private lands . <p> Ducks : Early season success in the Boardman/Umatilla areas of the Columbia River has remained relatively steady and duck concentrations are beginning to increase . Hunting should improve as the weather turns colder . <p> Geese : Hunting has been slow as few geese have arrived in the Boardman/Umatilla area .

Good numbers of spikes should be available in the Sumpter Unit for Second Bull Season . <p> Bear and Cougar : Numbers are increasing . <p> Chukar and Hungarian Partridge : The seasons continue through Jan. in Baker County .

It is not legal for bear hunters to use a centerfire or muzzleloader rifle to hunt bear during the controlled bull elk rifle season or general elk season unless an unused elk tag for that unit is in their possession while in the field . <p> Cougar : Hunter success should be the best in the Walla Walla and Mt . Emily units . Hunters will probably find best success using predator calls to attract animals . Cougar hunters are also reminded not to hunt with a centerfire or muzzleloader rifle unless a valid unused rifle elk tag is on their person during the controlled bull elk rifle season or general elk season . <p> Elk : The second elk rifle season began on Nov. 7 .

Hunters will have best success along creeks or in brushy areas next to grain fields . <p> Chukar and Hungarian Partridge : Spring production was average and hunters should find local concentrations appropriate habitats .

First season hunters in Starkey had about 6-10% success for spikes and about 20% for either sex . Catherine Creek hunters had about 3-6% success for bulls . Heavy snowfall during the first couple of days of the second season has contributed to low success rates and limited hunter movement .
