<p> " Me , me , the cheapest of God 's sinners , saved , " he 'd orate from the pulpit . In the story of his fall and redemption , they 'd found a parable for their own far homelier lives . The point was : If God could reach down and rescue a sinner the likes of this sinner ... <p> Sometimes , recounting , he 'd begin to weep . <p> Over and over he had professed to them an almost unimaginably sinful and dangerous past : a mob killer for hire , snuffing lives . But Christ had chosen to save him and so Pastor Ed in turn was seeking to help save them . God writes straight with crooked lines . <p> And then , about two months ago , the real truth of a pastor 's past fell out . <p> Know what the charismatic shepherd of the First Baptist Church of tiny West Richland ( pop . 3,900 ) really was in his earlier life ? <p> A tawdry little wife-murderer and girlfriend-stabber who 'd jumped his parole practically the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Turns out that not only was Brother Ed Lopes  --  it rhymes with ropes  --  prevaricating through his pearlies about his career as a two-decade contract murderer for the Mafia . But the reverend , who 's 5 feet 3 and walks with a peppy little bounce , was also cock-and-bulling the flock about Billy Graham and Chuck Colson coming to pray with him in prison . And that story about 350 employees of the Pontiac Correctional Center in Illinois  --  " every last man from the warden on down "  --  who signed a petition so he might get sprung ? <p> Bilge water . <p> They trusted him ; he deceived them . It 's that simple . Except it is n't . <p> Because for one thing , that would n't take into account the force for genuine good Pastor Ed seems to have been the entire time he was in their midst . It 's part of the mystery : the liar who effects good works , who can infiltrate a community of too-willing believers and get them on the path to righteousness . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it conducts its worship services out of a 100-seat cement-block subbasement in a building that never quite got finished as a house .

The green corrugated mobile home next door is Pastor Ed 's office  --  or was , in that the exposed preacher is now in custody , has given up his pastorship , has been taken by federal marshals back to the Midwest , his fate to be determined by the Illinois Prisoner Review Board . <p> In the evangelical tradition there is a strong reliance on the personal conversion story . The wickeder you once were , the better . Pastor Ed 's tale was and still is the wonder of a Gospel-changed life . <p> Listen . These are close friends and church members speaking , and also one wife  --  a third . They love this man . They 've forgiven this man . It 's true they may no longer desire him as their spiritual leader . But that fact is to be distinguished from any kind of rejection . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who 've cast their ballots to remove Pastor Ed 's preaching license , refuse to reject him . Rejection is n't a Christian value . <p> Some , in fact , would say nothing 's changed . <p> " None of it changes my mind , none of it . I do n't care what comes out . You see , you do n't know the man . That 's the difference . Those things happened before the man was changed . You notice I said ' was changed . ' Not ' changed . ' " <p> That 's Joe Guilford . He 's sitting in his socks in a swivel easy chair . He 's a big friendly guy in medical supply . He played a key role in getting Pastor Ed to come to the state of Washington in the first place . <p> " Now we know there 's a man in the Bible who had a bad past . Paul . He was Saul of Tarsus . I 'm telling you I would trust that man with my granddaughter , my money , my house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guilford . When she mentioned her granddaughter she pointed at baby Kendall , playing with a doll across the room . <p> " I ca n't condemn him , no . I had a lot of respect for the man . He was kind , he was helpful . He 'd come and visit at the time my husband was in his last illness . He 'd help me with my coat . ... I pray for him daily now . I ask Him if it 's His will he should go back to prison , he 'll continue to witness to those in the prison . Because if God forgives him , and I think He has , then we have to forgive him .

I would rather go through this than him . Did n't you ever stretch the truth in your life ? The man you 're talking about is not the man I know . This is the most deeply loving man I 've ever known . He 's just the most precious little thing there is . " <p> That 's Joan Lopes . She 's Pastor Ed 's wife . The two met through the U.S. mails 14 years ago when he was still a convict . It was out of the misdirected need to impress a pen pal that a born-again man behind the walls apparently first began spinning the fictions of a mobland past . Joan and Ed made their marriage vows over the interstate phone wires on New Year 's Eve 1979 . " Do you believe Jesus Christ is our High Priest ? " he 'd said . He 'd called collect . " Then why do n't we declare our marriage vows right here and now ? " <p> Joan Lopes is sitting this moment on the Guilfords ' sofa , running her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems very tranquil , in the lap of her Lord . Except her left leg is trembling . <p> " I want it in this story that this man made me what I am , " she says flatly . <p> In a sense , maybe this is n't about Pastor Ed at all but about an unearthly thing called religious belief . <p> The Trail to Prison Facts , as opposed to the fictions , of a baroque life : <p> He 's 56 , of Portuguese-Catholic parentage in Plymouth , Mass . In his high school yearbook his motto was , " Speed is our safety over thin ice . " He abandoned his first wife and four daughters . It was a long time ago . <p> His second wife 's name was Phyllis Brown . But he was n't Pastor Ed then , he was " Jasper Brown " and he was living in Illinois . On a June Sunday in 1970 , Phyllis Brown 's husband of nine months strangled her and then spaded her body into an 18-inch grave in a desolate corner of DuPage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his new-found lover  --  whom he 'd met a month before on the golf links . Her name was Shirley Johnston . <p> But things soured here too  --  she told him she wanted to break it off  --  and so 33 days after the murder of Brown , Ed Lopes stabbed and strangled and tried to suffocate his lover , leaving her for dead before lighting out for Florida under yet another alias . In December 1970 the badly decomposed body of Lopes 's wife was discovered by excavators installing a septic tank . The police could make an identification because of the plaster of Paris : Her right arm was in a cast when she was murdered . <p> In the Sunshine State several months later , Ed Lopes was nabbed on a forgery . They returned him to Illinois , where eventually he was convicted of both murder and attempted murder , receiving a 50-to-99-year sentence . He served 11 1/2 years and then was released in February 1983 after several parole hearings on the condition he not leave the state . Which he did . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit " put out paper " on Lopes . But apparently no one in Illinois ever chased him terribly hard . <p> Two years later , in 1985 , after an interim stay in Grand Island , Neb. , where he 'd worked at several jobs and impressed many Christians with his kindness and gentle ways and commitment to his Savior , Lopes and his third wife ( they 'd wed in a civil ceremony in addition to the impromptu phone-wires marriage ) came into the high-desert , river-basin valleys of southeastern Washington . By then the ex-con who 'd found God and Gideon in his cell was preaching the word , though not formally or full time . <p> One other fact : Back in Illinois , after Lopes had been put in prison for the murder of a wife and attempted murder of a cohabitant , homicide detectives from Brockton , Mass. , sought to question him . They wanted to ask him about the death , in a previous decade , of a 34-year-old Massachusetts woman named Helen Hanson . At the time , July 1966 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Massachusetts authorities have since said there was some indication to believe foul play had occurred . <p> There was a certain ambiguity . <p> What is not ambiguous is that immediately after her death , one Edmund Henry Lopes  --  who 'd been her lover  --  dropped from sight . <p> Dozing unattended in a crib next to the body of Helen Hanson on the stifling summer day she was found at 900 Crescent St. in Brockton was a 6-month-old baby girl . This child had been lying next to her dead mother for about four days , police estimated . <p> Helen Hanson and Ed Lopes had lived together for approximately a year prior to her death . <p> When Massachusetts detectives did locate Lopes , it was half a dozen years later and he was in a maximum security institution in Illinois with a 50-to-99 sentence on his back . He refused then , refuses still , to talk to the investigators about Helen Hanson . <p> It is unclear at the moment what Massachusetts is going to do , if anything . <p> The Truth Uncovered Wanda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tri-City Herald who uncorked this tale . She 's 53 and has worked in newspapering for 23 years and has found herself these past few weeks the object of considerable limelight . <p> " Basically , I started out to write a feature in December about a bad guy gone good , " she says . " A local minister here who 's a friend of mine told me there was this charismatic pastor over in West Richland I might want to do a piece on , because he had this really interesting background . Everybody called him Pastor Ed . He 'd worked for the Mafia , executing people . That sounded pretty dramatic . " <p> She called him and he was all for it . They talked for five hours on Dec. 5 in the green trailer next to the church . He was nothing if not vivid : the disillusionment he 'd felt as a soldier in Korea ( never was in Korea ) , the stilettos he used to strap to the inside of his wrists , the cars , the women , the casinos , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the 9mm Luger named " Betsy , " the fabulous riches he 'd earned for those " 27 or 28 " hits from the coldblooded folks at Murder Inc . <p> On and on . <p> In and amid all the Mafia tales , he told Briggs he 'd once killed a girlfriend with a kitchen knife , did n't specify it other than that , but told her that this crime , not the mob hits , was what the FBI finally caught him on . <p> Which was a lie that curved near the truth . <p> " I 'll have to call Illinois and verify some of this , " she told him . He did n't blink an eye . <p> " He wept . He was so believable . And what 's so weird , he did seem like a nice guy , he did seem like a good man , " she says . <p> She started checking out the story , and soon it was collapsing like a cardboard house . Illinois fugitive units contacted Benton County authorities and within a week Pastor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in custody before friends and church members posted a $ 50,000 bond . The next day Pastor Ed drove to an Assembly of God church across the Columbia River in Oregon and said it was all lies , lies , what they 'd read about him in the paper . The parole thing was a paperwork mistake , he said . <p> The next day , Sunday , at the First Baptist Church of West Richland , Pastor Ed took the pulpit , though first he went down into the aisles and stood among them . Three times he said , " People , do you love me ? If so , do you forgive me ? " <p> He was pacing , demanding , imploring . <p> For nine days more he sought to make it all go away . But the tide he was swimming against was now too great . On Christmas Eve , six pastors from the Columbia Basin Baptist Association forced a meeting in the nearby town of Pasco . They urged him to come clean . They said they 'd love him , forgive him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 29 , Lopes faced his flock and told them the truth  --  mostly the truth . <p> " I have lived a lie , " he said . He had sent out a letter , asking all of them to come . " You 've come to hear a confession , and you will , " he said . Not even infants stirred in the pews in the church that morning . <p> He said he had killed two women and tried to kill another . He said the gangster stuff was all invented . He told them he was ashamed . He said he 'd lied out of a fear of rejection . <p> The next day Lopes met with Wanda Briggs and two local Baptist pastors at the offices of the Tri-City Herald . Briggs kept probing about the " second murder . " When was it , where was it ? He remained vague . Finally he said he 'd committed this murder in Brockton , Mass. , sometime in the ' 60s . He could n't remember the woman 's name . <p> Several times that day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the math was n't adding up . Bill Phillips , one of the two pastors present , said point-blank , " Listen , Ed , how old are you ? " Finally he mumbled , " Brother , I 'm 56 . " Phillips nearly exploded up from the table . He said : " You mean , after all this , you ca n't even tell me the truth about something as simple as your age ? You 've been lying and lying about that too ? Enough is enough . " <p> Several weeks later , the congregation at First Baptist voted him out . Pastor Ed was back in the county jail for a second time by then , his bail revoked , awaiting a court hearing regarding transfer to Illinois . Not everyone voted against him , and that is important to note . No , there was terrible emotion at the church that evening of the vote , according to several of those present . A garment seemed to be renting itself . A half dozen at First Baptist ended up resigning their memberships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the return of Pastor Ed from exile . <p> And they have . <p> Mixing Fact and Fiction Not everything he ever told them was a bald-faced lie , and perhaps this is one reason it lasted as long as it did : There was always the selected actual fact , true fact , onto which the tissues of his untruth had been wound . For instance , no one in West Richland seems to doubt that Pastor Ed really did find God in prison , pretty much as he described it , that he did have the kind of conversion experience that nonbelievers have difficulty fathoming . <p> This nothwithstanding , the conversion did n't come on death row . There was n't any death row in Illinois then . <p> More facts of a byzantine life : <p> He 's mad for Louis L'Amour novels and Charles Bronson movies and domino games and also C &W; tunes . He calls his wife " Angel . " She calls him " Lover Boy . " <p> He has never been in a seminary , did n't need a theological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at West Richland can " call " anyone they choose to lead them . All you need is a license to preach . <p> Years ago , back in Massachusetts , he used to tell people he was Trini Lopez 's cousin . <p> In his congregation at First Baptist were two local law enforcement officers . They bought the lies . <p> Eleven and a half years for murder and attempted murder might seem like a pretty small price , but actually it 's right on average : In 1983 , the year Ed Lopes was sprung , 234 murderers were released from the Illinois prison system . The average time served by these 234 was 10.2 years . <p> He 's a great ump of ballgames . " He was not a good basketball referee , but everybody wanted him behind the plate for baseball , " says Dale Baird . " He had a good strike zone . " Baird lives several blocks from the church . He drives an 18-wheeler . His wife , Lois , plays aching piano at the Sunday services . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's something that 's happened . It 's made all of us grow as Christians . " <p> Does n't it hurt that the others have now split off ? <p> " Yes , it does , it does . But in the Bible , there 's many mentions of a ' sifting ' process . " <p> One other fact : Pastor Ed declined to be interviewed for this story . Initially he said yes , but then on legal advice turned the request down . ' Crooked as a Snake ' A choir of testimony . <p> Andy Miller , prosecutor of Benton County : <p> " I think there was a feeling in the beginning he was being unfairly prosecuted . One of his parishioners called up a local TV station and said that I admitted it was a paperwork mistake  --  which of course was n't true . His attorney , for instance , will say he has n't broken the law since he got out of prison except for jumping the parole . Has n't changed his name here in Washington . Has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been a model citizen . Et cetera . But what gets lost here in situations like this , I think , is the families of the victims . There 's a sense of the feeling of justice . If you do n't punish people for parole violations , why have the parole system at all ? " <p> Diehl Rettig , civil attorney and born-again Christian who did initial defense work for Lopes , then handed the case to Larry Stephenson , a criminal lawyer : <p> " We had a psychologist do a profile . He came out well . He was not a deceiver on this test . Then we had a polygraph . ' Have you committed crimes since your release ? '  --  that was one of the crucial questions . Again , he came out well . ... I think people who commit horrible crimes and realize what they 've done later in their life want to make amends for it somehow . I think some of the things he 'd told his congregation  --  well , a lie , as you say  --  was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He just could n't tell it the real way . " <p> Is it possible he talked to the Tri-City Herald because he wished to get caught ? <p> " That 's part of it , " says Rettig . " That 's certainly part of it . Not on a conscious level ; it would have to be subconscious . " <p> Bill Phillips , pastor of the First Baptist Church in nearby Kennewick , Wash. : <p> " I tell you , emotions have just gone top to bottom , left to right , on this . The braggadocio quality of his Mafia fictions always bothered me . There was something in me that did n't want to believe it . But you see he was such a believable person . Look , I want it understood that Brother Ed Lopes did no doubt have a personal experience in prison with a Gideon Bible . I believe he 's a born-again man . But born-again people can be crooked as a snake . " <p> After the Fall Sunday worship services . The way you get to West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curling Yakima River . The sign at the bridge says , " Dismount and lead horses . " West Richland is about the smallest and scruffiest of the handful of towns in this sagebrush-scented valley . <p> The church , in a neighborhood of double-wide trailers , is so small : 10 pews in a white , low-ceilinged room . On a plywood board in the sanctuary : " Enrollment  --  60 . Offering Last Sunday  --  $ 822 . Offering Today  --  $ 675 . Building Fund  --  $ 4,600 . " <p> A pastor from a neighboring church is filling in today . He never mentions Ed Lopes by name . " You 're actually blessed , " he tells them . " You ca n't see it right now , but you are . And I 've got a feeling everything 's going to be all right . " The offertory hymn is " The Old Rugged Cross . " <p> Four hours later , Joan Lopes is sitting on a sofa at her friends the Guilfords ' . Her grown daughter is here too . Her name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she was a little girl and he was in for life . In fact , it was through letters to the daughter that the mother met him . <p> Joan Lopes is 58 , attractive , wire-haired , fidgety in her calm . She says that before Ed , she 'd known a long brutalizing marriage . After she fell in love with the tiny convict , having experienced him only by photograph and his letters and his oddly compelling long-distance voice , she wrote him every day . Every day until he got released and fled to her in Nebraska . <p> " The fifth letter I got , he told me what his crimes were , he never shucked and jived , " she says . <p> What did he tell you , exactly ? <p> " He said murder and attempted murder . " <p> He did n't specify ? <p> " No . " <p> Did n't the fact of murder bother you ? <p> " It was not the man I was writing to . " <p> Then , " One morning here a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ball and chain to my right leg , it was shaking so . I want you to know I have never for one minute doubted that little man . " <p> And then , " What 's long ? Is a year long ? Is two years long ? He 's going to get out of this mess . He 's still going to be my little lover . " <p> The Result <p> Two days ago Ed Lopes went before a three-person board at the Joliet Correctional Center in Illinois . His wife was with him . The panel found him to be in violation of the terms of his 1983 parole . He is to remain in custody until May 18 , and then , if there has been no misbehavior , he 'll be released under a parole supervision program , at which time there 's a very good chance he 'll be given an okay to go back to southeastern Washington and rejoin his splintered flock . <p> Yesterday the chairman of the prisoner review board said Pastor Ed had made an excellent presentation .
