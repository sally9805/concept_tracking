The former president of the American Physical Society reflects on the challenges facing both the society and physics at large in the light of falling budgets , a revamped rationale for supporting science and the advance of the information age . <p> I want to present a very personal perspective on physics and its current circumstances . I 'd like to emphasize the word " personal . " I do not assume my perspective has general validity or global significance . I do hope it will be of some interest to some of you and that it will perhaps provoke some useful thoughts about the compelling calling we share . <p> It has been my privilege and pleasure to serve as president of the American Physical Society . I thought I would begin by telling you how that came to be . I am of course a physicist by training . Some recent reflection led to the realization that beginning with my graduate student days , I have spent about a quarter-century doing , or trying to do , serious physics . I like to think I actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have spent almost as much time doing things that can variously be described as administration , management or maybe , on good days , providing leadership for three universities and for that Federal agency that we all know and love , the National Science Foundation . <p> I joined the APS and became part of it  --  and it became part of me  --  as a graduate student . I used to own  --  because I came to the painful conclusion that I was unlikely ever to use it again  --  a complete set of Physical Review Letters , beginning with volume 1 , number 1 . Over the years the APS served me well . I attended its meetings and voted in its elections . I served as chairman of the division of condensed matter physics when most of us still thought of it as solid-state physics . But then , as the focus of my life shifted from physics to other things , I drifted away from the APS and its affairs . <p> In 1990 a voice from my past suggested that I become a candidate for vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decade since I had done any serious physics . The obvious correct response to the . invitation was : " Certainly not ! That would be silly . I 've been out of the field too long . " But then I remembered that when strangers ask me what I am , I rarely say " professor " or " administrator " or " chancellor . " I usually say , " I 'm a physicist . " I remembered that that identity means much more to me than a professional label . It says something that 's important to me about how I view myself and the world . It explains the thrill I still feel when , in the flood of information that washes over me daily , I encounter news that one of my fellow physicists has discovered something interesting . It is a point of pride and a badge of honor . It is , in short , one of the most treasured elements of my own self-image , my identity . <p> So , I agreed to run for office . It seemed to me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wonderful way to get back among physicists . Having spent the last couple of decades " wandering in the wilderness " and dealing with all manner of folks , I thought it would be nice to interact again with real physicists . So I ran and , much to my surprise , I won . I thus returned to a corner of the world of physics . And more than most newly elected officers , I returned with something of an outsider 's perspective . Whether that makes my observations here more objective or perceptive , I can not say . But there may nonetheless be some value in sharing them with you . <p> What did I find ? Well , I found a society that was burgeoning in every respect . The publications program of the APS has been enormously successful by any measure . APS journals have become the world standard for publication in physics . Increasingly those authors lucky enough to publish in them come not just from the US , not just from the membership of the APS , but from all over the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good management of our editors , led by Ben Bederson , and of Harry Lustig , APS 's financial guru , the society is financially healthy because our journals are financially healthy . <p> The nonpublication activities of the APS are legion . Frankly I was surprised by how many things the APS does besides publishing journals and sponsoring conferences . Here are a few The panel on public affairs and the physics planning committee work on the interactions between the physics community and the world of politics and policy . There are committees devoted to physics education and to enhancing participation of women and minorities in physics . Increasing efforts are devoted to getting the word out about physics . What 's New , that famous ( or , in some circles , infamous ) weekly opinion piece , is probably the most widely read scientific society communication in Washington and across the country , maybe the world . A widespread unease <p> In short , we have good reason to be pleased and proud that our society is booming and prospering . And yet . . . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unease about physics and its future . Increasingly questions are being asked about who we are , what we are , what we do , how we support what we do and where we are going . <p> The symptoms are many . No one reading this article needs to be told that we have all been suffering from tight budgets . Budgets are tight just about everywhere , both at the Federal level , in those agencies that support our research , and at our home institutions , be they universities , national laboratories or industrial laboratories . We 've seen tight budgets before , of course , so our present circumstances would be regrettable but unremarkable if not for the fact that there are real indication ' that we are not simply passing through a minimum in some normal budget cycle . There are major structural changes under way in our national economy and in the relationships between the physics community and the institutions that have supported it since World War II . In my opinion that means that our financial base can be expected to be uncertain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of anything particular that physicists have or have n't done but because the circumstances of our nation and all its institutions are changing and because priorities are consequently being reexamined and reordered almost everywhere . <p> I 'm sure you 're all aware that the so-called discretionary part of the Federal budget has been shrinking steadily as a result of various pressures , including the inexorable growth of entitlements and increasing debt service on the national debt . Unfortunately we in physics and all of the agencies that support us are " discretionary . " That 's also true for our public universities at the state level . I have seen projections that suggest that if one simply extrapolates present rates of change in the major elements of Federal and state budgets , their discretionary parts will go to zero sometime early in the next century . For physics , then , the default state is annihilation ! <p> That means that support for physics and physicists depends critically on the attitudes and understanding of our political leaders about the contributions we make to society . It also means that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debates about major national and local issues that might seem to have little to do with physics . I believe it 's quite literally true , for example , that the outcome of the debate about health care reform is enormously important for physics , because if that debate does not lead ultimately to effective containment of the growth in health care costs , physics will feel the effects strongly and fairly quickly . <p> More than a few public universities in this country , including those in my own University of Maryland system , have recently experienced absolute decreases in their state funding on the order of 20-25% . We used to worry when the second derivative of budgets changed sign from positive to negative . Now we 're seeing sign changes in the first derivative . The long-term consequences of this shift , and the fact that current budget trends are not likely to change dramatically anytime soon , are only slowly becoming apparent in our universities and their physics departments . Physics supply and demand <p> There 's increasing concern about what 's happening to our young physicists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are too few jobs for them . Whichever it is ( and there are differing views about that question ) , there 's clearly a mismatch between supply and demand . The employer mix has changed and continues to change . The traditional homes for physicists  --  universities and Federal and industrial laboratories  --  are all undergoing rapid and sometimes nearly discontinuous change . <p> We all know what 's been happening to those industrial laboratories that once employed a substantial part of our society 's membership . Some have simply vanished . Others have been transformed into enterprises that engage less in the kinds of fundamental research that physicists like to do and more in the kinds of research and development that appear to promise near-term economic gain for the industries that support them . Once upon a time physicists also did that sort of thing and did it well . Unfortunately physicists today are often seen as too narrowly specialized to be effective in situations requiring quick solutions of complex multidisciplinary problems . <p> Questions continue to be asked about our national laboratories . Many of them are creations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create new weapons and to improve old ones was seldom questioned . Now , as these laboratories scramble to define new missions compatible with the circumstances of the post-cold-war era , it is no longer obvious to many that physics and physicists must necessarily remain at the core of the laboratories ' programs . <p> The end of the cold war presents a challenge that transcends the national weapons laboratories . For the first time in almost half a century the political leaders of our nation are seeking a new rationale for supporting science . For most of that half-century the rationale for supporting physics of all kinds was clear and simple : It was national security  --  military security . Physicists could help save us from the Communists . The disintegration of the Soviet Union has undermined that rationale and set off a search for a new one . Today it 's almost certain that the new rationale for supporting science will have less to do with military security and more to do with economic security and global competitiveness . The role of physics in our national pursuit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in our quest for military security . The notion of " strategic " research is much discussed both inside and outside the Washington Beltway . Senator Barbara Mikulski , Representative George E. Brown Jr and others , including some of you , are trying to arrive at a common understanding of just what that term might mean and how one might continue to justify research in the most fundamental fields of science based on their strategic importance to the nation . <p> Public perceptions about physicists and their institutions seem to be changing , and not necessarily for the better . The demise of the Superconducting Super Collider is fairly commonly seen as a defeat not just for high-energy physicists but for physicists in general . There are not a few of our scientist colleagues who take a certain pleasure in this , who take the view that " those high-riding physicists have finally had their comeuppance . " The Germans have a word for it : Schaclenfreude . To some the fate of the SSC symbolizes the end of an era in which for most laymen physics was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Others argue that if the 20th century belongs to physics , the 21st will belong to biology . Personally I think there may be something to that argument . Just as the astonishing scientific and technological achievements of this century have stemmed largely from a few fundamental discoveries in physics ( quantum mechanics , especially ) , it seems likely that the next century will bring comparable wonders rooted in an expanding understanding of DNA . It is worth recalling , however , that several of the founders of molecular biology were physicists . It is perhaps not too chauvinistic to suggest that if there still survives among us the intellectual strength , flexibility and boldness for which we were once renowned , when the molecular biologists reach their goal of completely understanding the genetic universe , they may find physicists there waiting for them . <p> Many physicists are professors , of course , and professors are n't getting the unquestioned respect they used to get . There is a fairly widespread belief that professors spend most of their time doing useless research on arcane subjects and consequently neglect their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Professors are thought to be underworked and overpaid . In the Maryland legislative session that ended this past spring our General Assembly mandated the development by our public universities of policies establishing explicit expectations for faculty workload and responsibilities , accompanied by detailed reporting of what our faculty actually do . We have n't been directly told there must be more teaching and less research , but that message is there , not far from the surface . Just to make sure they have our attention , our legislators are holding up $20 million of our appropriation pending completion of the required policies and reports . This sort of thing is not unique to Maryland . Legislatures in almost half our states have taken some action related to faculty productivity . <p> Let me hasten to say that I do not consider this development an unalloyed evil . We all know there 's just enough truth in our critics ' claims about what professors do , do n't do and should be doing to warrant our close attention and corrective action . I think our Maryland legislators have done us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer evade our responsibility for taking such action . I also think this development contains some special challenges for academic physicists . Most of the students they teach are not on the road to becoming physicists . I 've frequently asserted that the canonical annual number of physics majors is of order 10 , independent of department size . It 's not majors but students in " service courses " who fill our lecture halls and laboratories . As the public focuses ever more sharply on faculty productivity , most often defined in the context of undergraduate education , physics departments are more vulnerable than most . It 's very hard to justify to a state legislator ( or a university administrator ) a physics department with 60 or 60 faculty whose only apparent direct product is 10 physics majors a year . Information revolution <p> Then there 's something else going on that is of critical importance to every institution where physicists work . That is the inexorable and rapid evolution of information technology . The APS is engaged in an intensive effort to understand how to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awry , financially or otherwise . As one of my university colleagues put it , the trick is to figure out how to be at the leading edge without finding yourself at the bleeding edge . <p> This is a formidable challenge . The APS publishes the most important physics journals in the world . Most of the society 's budget is associated with its publishing business , and that business contributes significantly to the support of all APS programs . In charting our course toward the new information age , it would not be difficult to make a mistake that would bollix up our journals or even bankrupt the APS . I know of no way to guarantee that that wo n't happen , but I am confident that some of our society 's best minds are fully engaged with the problem . As they wrestle with it , I hope they will keep in clear focus that the principal function of the APS is not to publish physics journals . It is to promote , enhance and provide for communication among physicists . If for almost a century publishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) activity , that is simply because books and journals have for half a millennium been the principal means of scholarly communication . That is now changing , and the APS must change with it . <p> The information revolution is also beginning to have profound effects on our universities and other research institutions . A university has been aptly defined as a community of scholars gathered around a great library . Traditionally that great library has been an enormous collection of printed artifacts stored in a very large building and acquired , managed and disseminated by information professionals called librarians . This too is changing , and rather quickly . Our research-information infrastructure is delocalizing and moving into cyberspace . Librarians are becoming managers of information , not publications . The time may come when the quality of a university library will be measured not by how many books and journals it possesses but by how few . What a library owns is becoming less important than what it can provide access to . <p> If that picture resembles the actual future of libraries , then what are the implications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expand on that question . Suffice it to say that I believe that over the next several decades we can expect to see important parts of our higher-education system also delocalizing and moving into cyberspace . There already exist institutions where that is beginning to happen . If I 'm right , then what kinds of academic institutions will nurture physics and its practitioners ? To change or not to change <p> Some of you may be getting a little anxious by now . If so , then perhaps I am achieving my objective , which is to persuade you that there are many things going on that have the potential to change our lives in major ways , things that we should try to understand and respond to for the good of physics and physicists . There 's change afoot , profound change , and we must recognize it and deal with it . That wo n't be easy . In some ways I think our society and our science have become a little too institutionalized , perhaps even a little ossified . We have become large : Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our budgets are large . With size and success have come inflexibility and resistance to change . Several years ago a longtime friend and colleague observed of a certain university , " The institution is in crisis , faculty morale is at an all-time low , and the only thing that could possibly be worse is any change . " I imagine that many of you are chuckling ruefully in recognition of the syndrome . I do n't think it 's confined to universities . I think our field may exhibit some of its symptoms . Rabi once said , " Physicists are the Peter Pans of the human race . " Might we have lost that wonderful characteristic ? Are we perhaps acting more like assistant vice presidents of the human race ? Are we still light enough on our intellectual feet to adapt to new realities quickly ? <p> I 'm delighted to say that I 'm confident we can . One of the things I discovered during my several years in the APS presidential line is that physicists are for the most part still the same good old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life . They care deeply about ideas ; a good idea is still treasured , regardless of the age or institution of origin of its creator ( if somebody can demonstrate that it really is good , of course ) . They are bright , competitive , argumentative and intensely collegial in the best sense of that word . They are immensely interested in mechanisms and in details . And they are self-confident , sometimes in the extreme . At that extreme , they fully merit the descriptive word that I hear rather often hereabouts : " arrogant . " I am wont to remark to a friendly audience that physicists have good reason to be arrogant , thereby , I suppose , exhibiting myself that salient characteristic of our kind . In short , I think physicists can deal with almost any challenge once they focus on it . <p> Once we get focused , what must we do ? I certainly do n't have a clear and complete agenda for that , but I can suggest some things that I think ought to be on the agenda . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we communicate the beauty and purposes of physics to those who are not members of our club . That includes those to whom we teach physics , both those few who are on the road to membership in our club and the many who are not . There are some splendid efforts under way around the country that can help show the way . There is a major and , I 'm pleased to say , close collaboration between the American Association of Physics Teachers and the APS that is directed at just this problem . <p> But we have a long way to go . We still have among us too many adherents to what I call the Parris Island school of pedagogy . You know the kind . You wonder how long they served as drill instructors in the Marine Corps . They 're the ones who make it abundantly clear that they 're looking for " a few good physicists , " that the only students worth serious attention are those few exceptional souls who are being groomed to join the next generation of physicists . How many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't teach students , I teach physics . " That must change . It must change because if we expect to continue playing any role in the education of anybody , whether it be the average student or the occasional candidate for membership in our club , our contribution must be made in the context of caring about students . And I mean all students , including women , minorities and those who are not the next Richard Feynman . Society expects no less , and our universities increasingly understand that they must expect no less . What about the public ? <p> Equally important are our communications with the public , the public that supports the institutions that support us . Here I think there are valuable lessons to be learned from public opinion surveys . I have n't looked carefully at any opinion surveys about physics recently , so let me give you an example from higher education . A year or so ago I read an interview with the pollster Daniel Yankelovich in which he reported that if one asks a representative sample of American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The average citizen thinks higher education is a necessity , something of great importance to his or her wet/-being and that of his or her children . The average citizen is also frightened that higher education is becoming too expensive and is moving out of his or her reach . Yankelovich then noted that similar surveys on the subject of health care began to yield the same two themes a decade or so earlier . The average citizen believes that high-quality health care is absolutely essential but also fears that it is becoming increasingly unaffordable . <p> Yankelovich then observed that the intensive debate in Washington about health care reform is being conducted by lawyers , economists , politicians and bureaucrats , with little visible participation by health care professionals . I have seen an occasional message on the subject from the American Medical Association , for example , but not on the front page of my newspaper . It 's buried back in the middle . Yankelovich believes that the physicians effectively ceded control of the health care issue to the politicians a decade ago , when they failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressed by them . The obvious lesson to be learned from this , if we only will , is that if university faculty expect to play a significant role in the ongoing reformation of higher education , they had better recognize that it 's occurring , that it is a challenge to them and that they had better step up to it and begin dealing with it . Higher education seems to be running a decade or so behind health care in the public view , so we have a little time . But faculty need to understand that they can ignore this challenge only at their own peril . <p> How does this translate into communication between physicists and the public ? I 'm not entirely sure , but I am convinced that we must stop focusing on what we 'd like the public to know about physics and start focusing on finding out what the public thinks and feels about physics and then devising strategies to respond effectively to what we discover . <p> I began by noting that this article is really a set of personal observations about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all the challenges physicists face just now , I can not avoid thinking of them as personal challenges . I hope you will too . For me , and I suspect for all of you , physics is a very personal thing . I did physics mostly for the pleasure of it , for that infrequent but , when it happened , extraordinary joy that came with discovering and understanding something never observed or understood by anyone ever before . I 'd like to think that most of you were attracted to physics for the same reason . It has been a particular pleasure for me to be associated with some of the best minds of my generation in an endeavor we all thought both important and fun . Physics has shaped my life in ways both superficial and profound . It has provided the very frame of reference in which I have thought and acted throughout my career , whether I was doing physics or trying to figure out how to solve a problem at a university or a Federal agency . <p> Physics is really one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek nothing less than a complete and fundamental understanding of the universe . Whatever our circumstances or difficulties may be at the moment , I think we all have an obligation  --  I 'm tempted to say a sacred duty  --  to push that endeavor forward . We must seek effective ways to do that both individually and through all our institutions , most particularly the American Physical Society . <p> By Donald N. Langenberg <p> <p> Donald Langenberg is chancellor of the University of Maryland system .
