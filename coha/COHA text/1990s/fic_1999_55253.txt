A Hwarhath Historical Romance <p> THERE WERE TWO WOMEN who fell in love . At first this was no problem . Their families were allies and trading partners whose ships plied the narrow ocean between the coast of Sorg and the Great Southern Continent . <p> The northern family was Sorg itself . Numerous , prosperous , clever and arrogant , these folk gave their name to an entire region . <p> In recent centuries the coast of Sorg has been improved in many ways : land drained and turned to agriculture , canals dug to carry away excess water and for transportation . The coastal people still prefer boats to the railroad , which they claim is noisy , dirty and unnatural . " If the Goddess had meant us to ride on iron rails , she would not have given us so much water . " <p> Most of the year a steady wind blows off the ocean . Modem silent windmills stand everywhere , their metal blades flashing " like a flock of little suns " in the words of a famous poem . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more numerous air cooling machines , which make the climate of Sorg tolerable to foreigners as long as they remain indoors . <p> In ancient times the coast was a place of brackish marshes , slow rivers , shallow bays and heat . The inhabitants would have been gray if they 'd kept all their fur , as they do now , being influenced by air conditioning and the opinions of other cultures . In those days , however , both men and woman cropped their outer layers of hair , leaving only the soft white undercoat ; and many decorated themselves by shaving certain areas down to the bare dark skin . <p> Imagine a folk with snowy fur so short that it hides no detail of the bodies underneath . Dark lines zigzag or coil over their angular shoulders and long narrow backs . ( The Sorg have always been a tall and bony people . ) Often their faces are partially shaved as well , becoming patterned masks from which stare eyes as blue as the ocean . Savages , we 'd call them now . In their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Their country was rich , providing them with fish , shellfish , birds of many kinds and luatin , which came into the coastal bays to breed . Though it is never easy to kill these massive animals , lust makes them less wary than usual ; and many of the bays could be turned into traps . In the coastal marshes the wis plant bloomed , red as blood or fire . Its sap made ( and makes ) a famous scarlet dye . <p> The southern family was Helwar . Their home was an island which lies off the northeast corner of the Great Southern Continent . A polar current runs up the continent 's eastern coast and coils around the island , bringing cold water , cool air , rain , and fog . The rain nourished the Helwar forests ; the icy current gave them fish ; the cool air made their flocks grow long thick wool . The family wealth , such as it was , came from these four sources : fish , wool , lumber , and ships . At the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . <p> It was the Helwar ships , seen in their own harbors and other places , which drew the Sorg south , traveling in wide wallowing barges better fit for rivers than the ocean . As rich as they were , they lacked the Helwar skill . To gain it , or at least the use of it , they offered an alliance . <p> How could the Helwar refuse these towering white and black people ? An agreement was made and confirmed with gifts , though the Sorg did not offer the one gift that makes an alliance unbreakable : their men as fathers for Helwar children . No bond is stronger than kinship . The offspring of such a mating would connect the two families as long as they and their descendants lived . <p> The Helwar made hints , which the Sorg pretended not to understand . Growing desperate , for they really wanted this alliance , the Helwar matriarchs made an offer of their own . They would send the five best and most promising young men in their lineage north to father children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and consulted among each other , while the Helwar waited anxiously ; and some of the islanders began to mutter that this might not be such a good deal . Maybe they ought to find more willing trading partners . Finally the Sorg agreed , though in a way that seemed grudging and reluctant . <p> " This is a beginning , " said the Helwar matriarchs to each other . " Once they have our ships , they will understand the appeal of a stronger alliance . " <p> When the Sorg left , five Helwar men  --  sturdy warriors  --  traveled with them . The motion of the Sorg barges was terrible , they reported later . " No wonder these folk want our ships . And the heat of their homeland ! We 're surprised that we did n't shrivel up like fish in a smoke house . But the job is done . All five women are pregnant . " <p> Reassured , the Helwar built ships for their new allies : deep-hulled ocean flyers . When the ships were finished , sailors had to be trained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Helwar . She arrived in the southern autumn , along with other young folk , female and male . All had short hair . Many shaved . What a sight they must have been among the furry , fog-gray southerners ! <p> The Helwar divided them , assigning each gender to the proper kind of ship . Like most of the peoples of the narrow ocean , they had both male and female vessels . The former explored new regions and traded in areas known to be dangerous . The latter kept to established routes , doing business with allies . <p> Sorg Ahl ended on the Foam Bird . The captain  --  Helwar Ki  --  was short , sturdy , and as gray as the winter ocean or the cloud-wrapped peaks of her island home . <p> Now we have brought together the story 's first pair of lovers , as gangling Ahl walks up the gangway of the Bird , carrying her journey bag over one shoulder . Ki looks down at her , admiring the foreign woman 's grace and evident confidence , but despising the unfamiliar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , both pointing down . A third triangle , this one pointing up , occupies most of her forehead . Rows of dark squares go down her arms . A final downward-pointing triangle rests between her upper pair of breasts , in no way concealed by her vest , which seems scanty to Ki . <p> The ship had two private cabins . One was for the captain . Ki put the foreigner in the other one , safely away from the test of the crew . She was the only daughter of Sorg on board . <p> At first , as might be expected , Ahl kept herself aloof , though she was a hard worker and eager to learn . Then one day Ki noticed Ahl had stopped shaving . She asked about this , <p> " It 's not easy to shave on board a ship , " the northerner answered . " Especially in the weather we 've been having ; and I do n't enjoy the feeling that ice-cold rain and spray produce when they beat against my bare skin . Finally  --  " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of looking like a foreigner . " <p> After that Ahl became more friendly . By midwinter she 'd stopped cutting her fur . " You people look so comfortable , " she told Ki and ran a hand along the other woman 's arm , ruffling , then smoothing the winter-thick hair . Ki noticed she was falling in love , but kept quiet , having no idea how to court a person who came from so far away . <p> In early spring they carried a cargo of pickled fish to a harbor on the eastern coast of the Great Southern Continent . The trip was stormy . By the time they reached land and tied up in protected water , all of them were exhausted . Nonetheless most of the crew went on shore . The lineage that held this part of the coast was connected to the Helwar by generations of interbreeding . They all had relatives in the houses that lined the harbor town 's narrow , winding streets . <p> Ki and Ahl stayed on board , Ahl because she was not kin to anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The storm had blown out to sea , and the sky in the east was black ; but where their ship rested , the sun shone , and the clouds were mostly white . Farther west , above low hills covered by a semitropical forest , the sky was clear . Hah ! It was pleasant tolie on the Foam Bird 's deck , sharing sunlight and a jug of halin . Ahl had unfastened her vest . Her four breasts were visible : rather flat , especially the lower pair , but with prominent nipples and large oval areolae so dark that they seemed black . Ki felt desire , stronger than before . Something about the day  --  the stillness , the brightness , their fatigue , the jug of halin  --  made it possible for her to speak . Voice halting , she confessed her love . <p> Ahl listened courteously , head tilted , blue eyes half closed . When Ki finished , she said , " If that 's so , why do n't we have sex ? " <p> Ki could think of no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of the ship and thick rugs laid under it , so crew members could sleep in open air . They went there and , in the dim light coming through the canvas , gave each other pleasure and release . When they were done , Ahl rolled onto her back and sighed . " It 's been a long time . " <p> " Do you have a lover at home ? " asked Ki . <p> " I did , a woman whose family is closely tied to mine . Most likely , she has found someone else by now . " <p> Ki repeated that she was in love . <p> Ahl raised herself on one elbow and looked at the little southerner . " More likely you find me interesting because I 'm foreign . " <p> No , said Ki . It was the true emotion . To prove this she listed the qualities she loved : Ahl 's hardworkingness , her courage , her even temper , her sense of justice . " There ought to be a fifth quality , but it does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like respect to me , " said Ahl . <p> " Well , then , I love your thin body , your small breasts , your silver fur , your laugh and the place between your legs , which bas a taste faintly reminiscent of fish . " <p> Ki loved fish , especially when just pulled from the ocean and lightly cooked in the grill on deck , so this was not an insult . <p> Ahl laughed . " Maybe you 're in love . Let 's continue and see what happens next . " <p> At first they tried to be secret . But it 's difficult to keep anything hidden on a ship full of women . Soon Ki 's cousins took her aside . " Stop this acting and sneaking back and forth between cabins . Everyone knows what 's going on . Be open and honest ! " <p> The two women became acknowledged lovers , holding hands in public , kissing and using the personal form of " you " and " she . " This continued until Ahl 's training ended , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to ask my mother to send me back here as soon as possible , " she told Ki . " I do n't know if I 'm in love ; it 's not a word that comes easily to me ; but I know I 'll miss you and the Foam Bird . " <p> Ki could say nothing . All her words had become stuck together in a lump at the back of her mouth . Sorrow lay in her mind like a heavy stone . <p> They parted , Ahl going up a gangway onto one of the ocean-flyers that Helwar had built for Sorg . The flyer spread its sails like great white wings and carried her away across the ocean . Little Ki went back to her own ship to grieve . <p> THE TRIP NORTH was easy , except for the jokes that everyone made about Ahl 's long fur . She ignored her relatives , remaining quiet and aloof . <p> " Is anything wrong ? " they asked finally . <p> " I 'm thinking . " <p> " Do n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the dry season . The marshes of Sorg baked under a cloudless sky , their vegetation turning yellow . The great house where Ahl 's mother lived was surrounded by gardens , kept watered except in times of severe drought . Ahl carried her journey bag past brightly colored ornamental plants . She dropped the bag in the entrance room and went looking for her mother . <p> The matron 's favorite place was a porch at one end of the house . The walls were carved wood screens , pierced by many holes . White gauze curtains hung inside the screens , keeping out most bugs , but admitting whatever light and air came though the holes . <p> This is how you should imagine the room : mostly shadow , but flecked with sunlight which has been slightly dimmed by its passage through gauze . In the middle is a large square table , where Ahl 's mother does her accounts , arranging colored stones in rows . Now and then a gust of wind stirs the curtains . When this happens , the room 's pattern of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the matron said , looking at her daughter . " You need a haircut . " <p> " It 's cold in Helwar ; I 'm planning to return there . " <p> Her mother frowned , then moved a stone from one row to another . <p> " I 'm not certain the alliance will hold . " <p> " Why not ? " <p> " They are a small lineage and far away . Aside from their ships , they are n't important . Allies should be neighbors or lineages so powerful they ca n't be avoided . That 's the rule . Everyone knows it . " Ahl 's mother lifted her head , giving her daughter another look . " None of the children fathered by Helwar is alive . " <p> " What happened ? " Ahl asked sharply . <p> " One woman was not pregnant , though she seemed to be ; or possibly she miscarried almost at once . Another woman miscarried at midterm . Two women remained pregnant , but their children died at birth . " Her mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deformed or too weak to survive . If so , the midwives would have killed them , rather than let them die slowly or live in pain . <p> " There 's one you have n't accounted for , " Ahl said . <p> " Your cousin Leweli . " Her mother looked down again , pondering an arrangement of red and reddish-purple stones . " She went hunting in the marshes . Her boat was found later , floating upside-down . She was not found . She and the child she carried have gone to the same place . " <p> The land of death , Ahl thought . Leweli was dead . " You think this is a sign . The agreement with Helwar is unlucky . " <p> " Maybe . They are a long way off . " Her mother paused , white-furred hand hovering over a red stone . " And not important . " <p> Ahl went to her room and unpacked , feeling grief for Leweli , who had been a distant cousin but a close friend , also for the other women who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself and Ki . <p> In time  --  not her first day at home , nor the second  --  it occurred to Ahl that Leweli 's death was strange . Her cousin had been a fine hunter , not in the least bit careless . Yet she had gone into the marshes alone while pregnant and done something so stupid that it killed her and her child . <p> Was this likely ? <p> No . <p> She would go into the marshes and speak with a cousin who lived there . This woman , closer to Leweli than anyone , might know what had happened . <p> The next morning Ahl saddled a tsin , riding past fields and orchards . The sky , as usual , was cloudless and brilliant . The road was dusty , even when it reached the marshes and wound among waterspears . The plants were in blossom , their tall stalks topped with bladelike/lowers as blue as the sky . <p> The woman Ahl went to visit was named Merhit . A witch , she lived by herself in a thatched hut by one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of behavior would not have been tolerated in any other kind of woman . But holy people make their own rules . If they want to live alone , they can . <p> Ahl reached the hut at noon , dismounted and tied her animal in the shadow of a tree . The witch was sitting in an arbor made of driftwood branches overgrown with vines . For the most part the wood was hidden , but here and there a small piece showed , white as a bone among glossy leaves . <p> " Well , " said Merhit . " You are back . " <p> Ahl squatted , pushing her wide-brimmed hat off her head . <p> " And you need a haircut , " said the witch . <p> " It was easier to get along with the Helwar if I looked like them . I 've fallen in love with one of their daughters , though I do n't imagine we have much of a future , if the alliance turns out badly . " <p> " It has turned out as planned , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no permanent entanglement in the south . " <p> Ahl considered this remark while looking at the channel 's dark water dotted with red-orange flowers . These were not wis , as you might think , but a closely related plant , which had no commercial value , though it was lovely . " What happened to Leweli ? " <p> " You know that five women mated with the men of Helwar . One had a mother who might be called weak . She did n't want her daughter to carry a child for most of a year , then lose it . " <p> " What do you mean ? " asked Ahl . <p> " It had been decided that none of the children would live beyond birth . " <p> " Why ? " <p> " The matriarchs of Sorg do not want this alliance . We are a proud family , also careful . The Helwar live far off and have nothing to recommend them except their skill in building ships . We have the ships now . " <p> " They wo n't last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That problem will be dealt with when it comes forward and can be seen . Our family is proud and careful , but does not always look into the distance . " <p> Ahl considered this information , squatting in dust and heat . No question about what the witch was saying : their relatives had decided to kill whatever children came from the Helwar interbreeding . A contemporary woman would be sick with horror or at least uncomfortable . What did Ahl , a woman of the middle distance in time , feel ? <p> Remember how many children died in the days before modem medicine . Those who were deformed or sickly died at once , of course , as they still do . It is a kindness we owe our kin . But many strong and healthy children died as well , due to illnesses which can now be prevented or cured . As a result , in many cultures , babies were called " guests " or " visitors " until they reached the end of their first or second year . Often they were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain ; and women tried to keep from loving these nameless children too much . If they had thought all the little ones they buried were true people , instead of beings who would turn into people in time and with luck , the women might have died of sorrow . <p> Because of this , Ahl saw the situation differently than we do . The two children who were killed at birth might have died later . How did she know for certain they 'd been healthy ? The idea was disturbing , but it did not make her sick . <p> " What happened to Leweli ? " Ahl asked again . <p> " The mother I mentioned told her daughter to pretend pregnancy . The daughter told Leweli what was going on . By this time Leweli was pregnant ; and it turns out she is one of those women who ca n't bear to lose a child . She knew if she stayed in her mother 's house and had the child delivered by midwives , it would die . She came to me . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As is her daughter , " said the witch . " A fine healthy child , though she has a definite southern look , which I do n't find attractive . " <p> " Where ? " asked Ahl . <p> " In the marshes , " said the witch after a pause . " I 'm not happy about this . The air here breeds too many diseases . As you know , I can foretell the future . The child is important . I knew it the moment I saw Leweli 's distended belly . I want the two of them in a place that 's safe . " <p> " What can I do ? " asked Ahl after a moment . <p> " Take them to Helwar . " <p> " How ? " <p> " My vision does not see . " <p> AHL LEFT , taking a different route , since she wanted time to think . The day grew hotter . She started panting and remembered an inn at the marsh 's edge . With luck it was still in business . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shade of a good-sized atchul tree . <p> Secondary roots hung from the tree 's branches , forming a greenish-white curtain . A few had reached the ground and burrowed down , becoming runners that would in time , at a safe distance from the parent tree , send up shoots . This is the atchul 's preferred way to grow , though it also flowers and can produce seeds . In youth  --  and this atchul was comparatively young , though larger than usual  --  it is surrounded by a veil of roots , none thick , most ending in midair . <p> In middle age the roots increase in size ; many dig into the earth ; instead of a veil of white filaments , they become a sturdy net . Outside the net , beyond the shadow of their mother , daughter trees rise , stretching out their branches , producing their own curtains or veils . <p> As the tree reaches old age the roots thicken even further , weighing the branches , pulling them toward the ground . Now the tree stands within a cage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it dies . <p> The tree is fairly common in the southern marshes , though rare elsewhere . Because of its behavior it has several nicknames : the Veil Tree , for obvious reasons , and the Sewing Tree , because of the way it grows , roots descending , then rising as another tree , then re-descending , as if it were stitching its family into the soil , generation after generation . <p> Finally it is called the Mother Tree , because it reminds people of their mothers : large formidable women who sew or figure their accounts in rooms where gauzy curtains hang and billow . <p> Ahl pushed through the veil of roots and saw the inn clearly . It was more run-down than she remembered , but a cart stood at the entrance . Brightly painted in a foreign style , it must belong to travelers . Ahl dismounted and led her animal into the courtyard . <p> Two tsina stood there , old and bony . One was apparently lame as well . A man stood next to it , examining a forefoot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the three broad toes , disturbed him . He groaned softly , released the foot  --  the tsin put it down gingerly  --  looked up and greeted Ahl in a courteous , despondent tone . <p> Not her concern . She returned the greeting , tied her animal and went inside . <p> A man sat there . Like the man outside , he was a foreigner with uncut fur . But the man in the courtyard had been middle-aged , while this fellow was barely more than an boy , slender and graceful , though not  --  it was obvious to Ahl  --  entirely sober at the moment . He lounged on a bench , his back against the rough trunk of the atchul , which formed one wall of the room . The other walls were plastered and white rather than gray , though almost as rough as the atchul . <p> The innkeeper was female and a true daughter of Sorg : tall , thin , white and black . Ahl got beer from her . " Is there another place to be ? " " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her tone apologetic . Anything would be better than sharing a room with an unrelated man . Ahl went out , finding an area paved with stone , shaded by the atchul 's leaves and curtained by its roots . <p> Hah ! Better ! There was even a breeze that stirred the hot air , bringing the aroma of summer vegetation to her nostrils . <p> She sat down , tasted the beer  --  it was cool in her mouth and pleasant on her tongue  --  then thought about her current situation . <p> Merhit was asking her to oppose her own mother , as well as all the other senior women of her lineage . No woman did this lightly . Many women  --  most women  --  would never do it . <p> But it was wrong to make a contract with the intention of breaking it , and even more wrong to break a contract made solid by children ; and to break the contract in such a way ! <p> No one would question the right of senior women to examine newborn children and decide , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> The job had to be done . A decent self-respecting family , one such as Sorg had always been , could not allow any of its members to die slowly . Nor could a decent family let children who had come out badly continue to live . What future did they have ? How could they be happy or useful ? The children who were killed held no grudge , as was known by the behavior of their ghosts . <p> The ghosts of adults are almost always resentful and dangerous . Hungry and angry , they haunt the living , looking for revenge or restitution . But the ghosts of newborn children cause no trouble . They appear in the houses where they were born and died , as if they do n't know where else to go , causing no trouble , merely lingering . In time they grow dim and transparent . Finally they vanish . No one is the worse for them . This proves no wrong has been done . The children have lingered out of ignorance and confusion , not because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The job of judging fitness to live was necessary . But it was the kind of decision that could not be left to the mothers who had borne the children ; young women as a group were unsuited to this kind of work ; and men were obviously utterly unfit . Beyond question the job was best done by matriarchs full of experience . They judged , then made sure the children  --  the ones not kept  --  died without pain . <p> The children were not always sickly . In times of famine Sorg women had killed healthy children . A great loss , but unavoidable . In addition , Ahl had heard of families who used infanticide to control the number of males and females in each generation . If times were difficult and violent , it made sense to have sons . In good times , one wanted daughters . As far as Ahl knew , the Sorg had never done this . Always confident and proud , they trusted in the Goddess and their own ability to turn any healthy child to a good use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil . <p> Maybe she would be justified in opposing the matriarchs of Sorg in this case , though the idea made her queasy . But how could she get Leweli and the child away ? By ship , of course . But a ship that belonged to Sorg would not take them ; and what story could she tell to foreign sailors ? Two women alone were certain to look odd . Why were n't they traveling with kin ? <p> The innkeeper came out . " Those men are quarreling . " <p> " Hah ? " <p> " Quietly , and in a language I do n't understand . Nonetheless , it 's a quarrel . I did n't want to stay . " <p> Ahl tilted her head in agreement . It was the worst kind of discourtesy for men to argue in front of unrelated women . <p> " They 're actors . Something happened to split their company . These two are all that 's left . For some reason they do n't want to go home , though it 's difficult to see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often men of irregular behavior . " Ahl said . This was a way of saying the men might be in trouble with their families . A terrible idea , but such things happen , and happened more often in the period of this story . It was the age called the Unraveling . An apparently endless war raged to the north of Sorg , on the continent 's Great Central Plain . For a while it had seemed that the great warleader Eh Manhata would bring peace by defeating all rival armies . But Manhata had died a year before ; and the war continued with increased savagery . <p> The innkeeper sat down and drank from the cup she carried . " I 've thought they might be criminals or outcasts , though they 're both very civil , and the older man has been through here before , causing no trouble . <p> " I saw him act the last time . He had a company of five , and they did the death of some hero . I forget which one , but he had a red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  about honor , mostly , as I remember . When the talk stopped , he gave a yell , and crash ! Down he went ! The men of Sorg are usually quieter when they die . What is there to talk about , anyway , in these situations ? " <p> Ahl could think of no comment , though she 'd enjoyed the few plays she had seen . She finished her beer and went to get her tsin , going around the outside of the inn , so as to avoid the quarreling men . When she looked closely , she saw the cart was shabby , its carving worn , its paint chipped and faded . <p> She got home at dusk . Great tall clouds were blowing in from the southwest , lightning flickered around their tops . <p> The storm broke after dark . Thunder woke Ahl . She lay in bed , listening to wind and rain . This was the way summer ended in her country . The season for safe ocean travel was almost gone . The task she had been given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> SHE WENT to Sorg Harbor the next morning . This was not a harbor town like the ones she had visited in the south : rows of houses climbing over hills ; steep streets paved with stone ; marketplaces , also paved ; and gar dens , mostly private ; but the people of the far south were not clutching , nor did they live in fear of thieves . It was a habit for them to share their gardens with passersby . Not everything , but something . Vines grew on the tops of walls . Pots of flowers stood by doors . Trees were left untrimmed , so their branches stretched over the street , dropping seeds in spring and leaves in autumn . In one town Ahl had walked through clouds of floating gauze . In another the streets had been carpeted with leaves as orange as fire . In a third there had been flowers , tiny and purple , dotting pale gray paving stones . Looking up , she had seen a flowering tree . <p> The Sorg preferred living on the farms established by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stays of foreign visitors comfortable . Their harbor town consisted of storage barns . Here and there it was possible to find an inn , though most foreign sailors and merchants stayed on their ships , which were more pleasant and less expensive . The streets were unpaved and badly rutted . Unused ground was either bare or full of weeds . <p> The harbor itself was a wide bay . Five docks extended into it . Two were for local fishing boats , empty at present : the boats were at work far out on the ocean . <p> It was the other docks that interested Ahl . Five deep-bellied freighters were tied along them . Shading her eyes , she surveyed each deck . All the sailors were black and white : members of her lineage or of closely allied families . <p> This was bad news , but it might not be the only news . Ahl reined her tsin at one of the taverns along the waterfront . These were the only structures in town that looked welcoming and pleasant . They were a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A wooden framework is anchored in large ceramic pots . Vines grow out of the pots and over the frame , creating an arbor open on one side . The taverns all looked toward the harbor . What else would interest sailors ? <p> Inside were benches and more pots , these with narrow mouths . Beerflies whirred around them or crawled on their lips . Ahl dipped beer into a cup , paid for it and sat down . <p> " Where are you from ? " asked a black and white sailor . <p> " Sorg . " <p> " You need a haircut , then . " <p> " I 've been traveling . I 'll find a barber now that I 'm home . " <p> The sailors went back to their conversation , which was about ships , as are all conversations in a harbor town . A Batanin women 's ship had left the day before , early enough so the storm would n't have caught it close to shore ; and there was a Taig ship outside the harbor , waiting for high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a male sailor added . Obviously he was Sorg or he would n't have been sitting with Sorg women , even in an arbor with an open front . " The Taig women do n't travel . The ocean is dangerous , they say , and uncomfortable . " <p> The other sailors  --  all women  --  grinned , tilting their heads in mocking agreement . The Taig women were right , of course , but there was more to the ocean than danger and discomfort . Let the Taig be timid , if they wished . The women of Sorg would sail , having confidence in their new ships and their family 's traditional courage and strength . <p> No other foreign ships were expected . <p> Ahl drank her beer and left , riding home thoughtfully . <p> " Where have you been ? " her mother asked . <p> " At Sorg Harbor . " <p> " You are turning into a restless woman , and you still need to get a haircut . " <p> " You 're right that I 've become restless , " Ahl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the marshes . " <p> " Better that than the ocean , " her mother said . " But I expect you to settle down soon . " <p> The next day Ahl took her questions to the marsh witch and found Leweli visiting . Her cousin 's fur  --  like her own  --  had not been cut recently , though for a different reason . The marsh was full of bugs , Leweli said . She wanted as much protection as she could get . " And Merhit , in spite of all her skills , is not a barber . " <p> The fur had grown to its full length and was as gray as fog . The baby nursing at Leweli 's upper left breast was the same color , though dappled . <p> " I 've never seen anything like this before , " Leweli said , sounding worried . <p> " It 's common among the island folk , " said Ahl . " Baby spots they call the condition . The spots usually fade , though now and then a person remains dappled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . " <p> Her cousin frowned , looking at the child , who had finished eating and gone to sleep . " I hope they fade . Though I do n't suppose it will matter , if she spends her life in a marsh . " <p> " She wo n't , " Merhit said firmly . <p> At this point Ahl explained her problem . How could she take Leweli and the baby south , if there were no ships in port except those belonging to relatives ? " I could make up a story , explaining why we need to go south . But I have never been a good liar . " <p> " This is true , " said Leweli . <p> " And you know that any Sorg captain would check the story with my mother . " <p> " You will have to go in disguise , " said the witch . " How fortunate that both of you have uncut fur . You can pass as foreigners . " <p> " Until we open our mouths and Sorg voices come out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's too late in the season . I do n't think any of our family 's ships will be going out again . " <p> The witch frowned and was silent for a while . Finally she said , " The Taig ship will be leaving . Go with them . " <p> " Two women and a child , traveling alone ? How likely are they to take us ? " <p> " This plan is doomed , " said Leweli . " I 'll have to stay here with you , Merhit . " <p> " First of all , the marsh is unhealthy , " the witch replied . " Secondly , I have visitors . Sooner or later you will be discovered . Imagine the trouble we 'll be in then . Finally , I know the child belongs with her father 's kin . I have seen that . " <p> No way to argue with a witch who 's had a vision . Ahl was silent . Leweli placed the baby in a basket lined with vegetation . The tiny hands were closed . Ahl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the soles of the feet were visible and dark gray . So were the four nipples , emerging from the fog-gray fur like buds . Even the dappling seemed lovely to Ahl , since it reminded her of the Helwar and Ki . <p> " Tell me everything that has happened to you since you left my house two days ago , " Merhit said finally . " Maybe there 's something that will help me find a path out . " <p> Ahl complied . After she finished Leweli said , " Would the actors take us north with them ? It sounds as if they 're in trouble already ; they might not mind a bit more trouble , especially if we paid them . " <p> Ahl realized she had n't thought about money . " Do we have any ? " <p> " I do , " Merhit said . " So does your mother . " <p> " Are you suggesting that I rob my mother ? " Ahl asked , horrified . <p> " One thing at a time , " said Merhit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go north . There 's a war on , as you ought to remember , and it has gotten so bad that even women are n't entirely safe . I 've heard stories of bandits  --  " She paused , apparently unwilling to continue . " The child belongs in the south . " <p> The child opened her eyes , revealing sea-gray irises . It was a southern color . Leweli had blue eyes , as did Ahl and Merhit and almost all the Sorg . <p> " Have you named her ? " Ahl asked , remembering Ki 's gray eyes . <p> " Not yet . When I need to call her something , it 's Darling or Dapple . A real name will come later , if she lives . " <p> " I 'm going to meet with the actors , " Merhit said . Moving quickly , as witches do when they have made up their minds , she saddled her tsin and rode off . This was not the animal we know in modern times , descended from chargers used by warriors on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tsin : short , stocky , thick-legged and broad-footed . Its coat was greenish-tan with pale , thin , vertical stripes which enabled it to blend with the marsh reeds . No breed of tsina is better over dubious ground . No breed is harder to find if it does n't want finding . <p> Ahl knew all of this , of course , and paid no attention to the tsin . Instead she settled down to admire the baby and talk with her cousin . <p> Admiring a baby takes time , if it 's done properly ; and talking about one 's family takes even longer . The afternoon passed without notice . All at once the light was slanting , and the witch rode back in view . <p> " Well ? " asked Ahl . <p> Merhit dismounted , groaned and robbed her behind . " It 's just as I thought . I know the actor . He 's been here often , though his former tours were luckier . What the innkeeper told you is true . His company has split apart , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go back north . ' War is bad for every kind of art , " Perig said to me , ' except the art of war . ' There may be other reasons , unpaid bills or the kinds of trouble actors get into . <p> " I offered him money to go south across the ocean and take the two of you , disguised as actors . Obviously it 's a dubious enterprise , but he 's desperate ; and he knows I 'm a good and reliable witch . I cured him of a throat inflammation that would n't go away . That was several years ago , but an actor remembers ! <p> " He 'll meet the two of you tomorrow at sunrise on the marsh road . Keep going till you meet him . " <p> " Are we leaving already ? " Leweli asked in a worried tone . <p> " Of course not . He has to train you . I 'll mind the baby . " <p> That was that . Ahl rode home on her animal , which was a crossbreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less careful about where it put its feet : a good animal for ordinary use and warfare on solid ground . <p> That evening she sat with her mother and two aunts in a porch with gauze curtains . Hanging lanterns filled the room with light . Ahl 's senior relatives sewed , while Ahl sharpened a favorite knife . Long and narrow , it was the best tool she had for cleaning fish . <p> " We 're getting tired of waiting for you to settle down , " an aunt said . <p> " We do n't usually produce flighty women in this house , " the second aunt added . <p> Ahl 's mother kept at her cross-stitch , saying nothing , though she glanced at her daughter . <p> " Give me a few more days , " Ahl said . " It 's disturbing to live in a foreign place . " <p> " We 'll remember this in the future , " her mother said . <p> The aunts tilted their heads in agreement . <p> " If we send any of our family off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Or women who are not promising . " <p> " Though your kin have n't come back restless , as you have , " Ahl 's mother added . <p> Ahl ran her whetstone along the knife 's blade . " What can I say ? " <p> " There is nothing to say , " her mother replied . " Remember who you are . And do ! " <p> Ahl excused herself soon after that and went to her bed , not through the house 's winding corridors , but outside though the garden . The air was cool and full of the scent of herbs . The sky was clear and starry . A meteor blazed in the north . Watching it , she swore two things . By the Goddess , she would find her way back to the Helwar and Ki . By the Goddess , she would not turn out like her mother ! <p> She made the morning rendezvous on time . The men stood on the road , sun rising behind them . They 'd brought their one healthy tsin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the witch 's tsin . <p> " We went to the harbor yesterday , " the older man said . " The Taig ship was planning to leave tomorrow , but will wait one extra day . Everything must be ready by tomorrow night . A challenge , let me tell you ! But actors are used to rapid changes of plan and fortune . " <p> " This is true , " said the younger man with a glinting smile . <p> The men pulled clothing out of their animal 's bags : male tunics , belts , swords and strips of fabric . " Put these on , " the older man said . " Use the strips of fabric to bind your breasts till they 're as flat as you can make them . We 'll take a walk down the road while you dress . Be rapid ! We have one day to teach you how to behave like men . " <p> They worked till noon , the women walking and turning , bending , hefting tools and weapons , speaking . The men watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pull a sword . At midday they rested in the shade of an atchul , a sapling with no secondary roots , . which had apparently popped up out of nowhere . The mother tree was nowhere in view . <p> The older man , whose name was Perig , said , " I think you 'd best pretend to be actors who specialize in female parts . They are usually tall ; and they often have feminine mannerisms . " He paused and gave the women a quick sideways glance . " I really ca n't imagine you as the kind of actors who play warriors or romantic leads . " <p> " Well enough , " said Ahl . " I 've never wanted to be a soldier , even in pretense . " <p> " They have the best roles , " said the older man in a comfortable tone . <p> " I prefer lovers , " said the younger man , whose name was Cholkwa . <p> " Well that you should , " said Perig . " You have the beauty and grace required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion and darkness required of heroes , " added the younger man . This sounded like an old argument , possibly a teasing one , though Ahl could n't tell for sure . <p> " That will come . Youth is not a time for passion . " <p> " It is n't ? " asked Ahl , surprised . <p> " The young experience lust , which is a fine and useful feeling . How else can a young man move away from his mother ? How else can he form friendships ? And the best friendships are those formed when young . But real passion , the kind that can be acted , comes later . You 'll see this , when you see me act . " <p> When noon was past they got up and practiced more . At last , when the sun was low in the west , the actors called a halt . <p> " I 've done what I can , " Perig said . " Meet us here tomorrow at midafternoon , and bring the money for our passage . The Taig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board . " <p> Leweli tilted her head . The two kinswomen rode off together . When they were safely away from the men , Leweli said , " Merhit has a message for you . Bring what money you can find . " <p> " She wants me to rob my mother , " Ahl said . <p> " Yes . " Leweli reined the witch 's tsin , though it was n't easy , since the animal knew it was going home . At last it came to a halt . Ahl stopped her more-obliging animal . <p> " We both know your mother has a cache under the floor in her counting porch . Most likely you know the exact stone and how to raise it . " <p> " This is horrible , " Ahl said . <p> " It was horrible for me when I realized they were going to kill my child , not because it was sick or deformed , but to escape an agreement they never intended to keep . Obviously it is shameful to rob one 's mother . But have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us in the way of honesty and honor ? " <p> Ahl groaned and tilted her head in agreement . <p> That night she went to her mother 's counting porch and pried up the right stone . Gold shone in the light of the tiny lamp she carried : coins , bracelets , chains , ingots and works of art that were too badly damaged to be shown : a mounted warrior with a missing head , a luat with two missing flippers , a statue of the Goddess in her guise of creator . The statue was hollow and had gotten crushed . Ahl could still recognize the Great One , her tools in her hands , the hammer that beat out the heavens , the axe that chopped out the earth ; but it was n't easy . <p> Coins would be the safest . They were least likely to be missed . She gathered two handfuls , then replaced the stone and hurried away , feeling self-disgust . <p> It was impossible to sleep now . Instead she went to the stable and saddled her animal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marsh . The day was hot already ; Ahl felt queasy ; it was n't a real sickness , she decided , but rather fear and shame . When she reached the witch 's cabin , she found Merhit outside , crouched next to a fire , brewing a potion . " It will keep the child sleepy and quiet . I have a wicker chest to put her in . She 'll be able to breathe . Did you bring the money ? " <p> Ahl pulled it out . Merhit examined the coins , putting several off to the side . " These are distinctive . Better to take only coins in common use . The ship will be in harbor tonight . Board after dark . By sunrise you 'll be on the open ocean . I 'll hide your animal . When you are missed , your relatives will think you 've run away or died in the marsh like Leweli . No one will connect you with a band of actors going south by sea . " <p> " The innkeeper knows there are only two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of their companions came back . Maybe they found new companions . " The witch stirred her potion , looking thoughtful . " Maybe I should talk to the innkeeper . She knows I met with the actors ; and your mother knows that you have been visiting me . I 'm a closer neighbor than your mother or any of the matriarchs . She wo n't talk , if I tell her not to . But I have to say this business of weaving plots is n't easy . I 'm going back to ordinary magic as soon as you and Leweli are gone . " <p> When the potion was cooked through and cooled , she fed a spoonful to the baby . <p> " Why are you doing this now ? " asked Leweli . <p> " To make sure the dose is fight . People vary in how they respond to magic , and it 's always hard to judge how much to give a baby . " <p> Soon Dapple was asleep , lying in the green shade of the witch 's arbor . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newborn , soft and round , still covered with down . All too soon the down is lost , giving way to rough fur and scales . But for a while such cubs have an unequaled charm . <p> Merhit poured the rest of the potion into jars and sealed them , pausing now and then to examine the baby . " The dose is right , " she said at last . " This is a healthy sleep , neither light nor heavy . She held out a spoon made of horn , yellow and translucent . " Take this . Always use it . Give the child a spoonful when you want her to be quiet , but never more than five times a day . " <p> " Is the potion dangerous ? " Leweli asked . <p> " All magic is dangerous , " Merhit said . <p> A little after noon the women set of . Leweli and Ahl rode double . Merhit , on her marsh tsin , carried Dapple in the wicker chest . <p> When they reached the rendezvous , the men were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . " Take your costumes and go down the road , " Perig said . " We 'll load your bags while you change . " <p> " Not the baby , " Leweli said . " It 's hot already and will get hotter , l do n't want her in that box . " <p> " What are you going to do with herr " Cholkwa asked . <p> " Carry her till the sun goes down . " <p> The two men looked at each other . " Very well , " said Perig . " But if anyone comes , you 'll have to hide in the marsh . " <p> Leweli agreed . The two women changed clothing , Ahl binding all four of her breasts . Leweli , however , left her upper pair free and used the binding strip to make a sling for Dapple . " If she wakes , I can feed her . " <p> They rejoined the men , and Perig said , " Another thing has occurred to me . By the time we reach Sorg Harbor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " This is true , " said Merhit , who was still on her tsin , watching everything . <p> " I also have a solution to this problem , " Perig said . " Or rather , Cholkwa does . " <p> The young man looked puzzled . <p> The older man smiled . " He likes perfume and always has a jar . We 'll pour it over Leweli  --  " <p> " What ? " cried Cholkwa . <p> " When we reach the south , dear one , I 'll buy you more . " <p> Cholkwa opened his mouth . <p> " You can argue on the way , " said Merhit . " Be careful ! And be lucky ! " She turned her tsin and rode off , leading Ahl 's animal . <p> The journey to Sorg Harbor was uneventful . They met no one . Only a fool would travel through weather like this , Perig remarked . Late in the afternoon they took shelter against the heat , resting in the shadow of a half-grown atchul tree . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't find the mother . Had it fallen ? Was this an omen ? Would she ever see her mother again ? Imagining the matriarch 's fury , Ahl decided she might not want to . <p> At sunset the four continued on their way , trudging through the long summer dusk into a starry night . By the time they reached Sorg Harbor the buildings were dark . <p> They stopped . Leweli put her baby in the wicker chest and , with Ahl 's help , strapped her upper breasts . The two men went off to relieve themselves . When they returned , Perig got out the perfume and dowsed Leweli . <p> " Too much , " said Cholkwa . " You know what she smells like now . " <p> " Like a man who sells the use of his body to other men , " said Perig cheerfully . " Better that than a mother . In the future , please remember to use the male pronoun when speaking of Leweli or Ahl . They are men now . " <p> " With a baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As you say , " Perig agreed in the same cheerful tone . He looked toward the women . Ahl could see starlight shining on his eyes . " You need new names . How does Lewekh sound ? And Ahlin ? " <p> " Good enough , " said Ahl . <p> Perig led them through dark streets . A few dim lanterns shone in the harbor , aboard docked ships . One was the Taig Far Traveler . A sleepy male voice asked , " Who ? " <p> " The actors , " said Perig . <p> " Come on board . " <p> Tired and half-asleep , Ahl helped unfasten the chest . She and Leweli carried it into a cabin . A lamp hung from the ceiling ; the still air stank of burning fish oil . Ahl forced open the cabin window . " It 'll be better once we 're under way . " <p> " Good , " said Leweli . <p> The men followed with bags , then left again . The tsin had to be delivered to its new owner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along one wall . Inside were five hammocks , neatly rolled , and five pots of fired clay , good-sized and glazed inside . The lids fit tightly . One was clearly for urination . She could tell by the shape and the emblem drawn on the outside . She did n't know the purpose of the others . <p> Leweli spread her bedroll on the floor , but Ahl  --  a sailor  --  hung up one of the hammocks , fastening it to iron hooks in the cabin walls . Along with the lamp and the cabinets , these were the cabin 's only furniture . A spare folk , the Taig . <p> Lying in her hammock , she regarded the lamp , which was iron and shaped like a fish with bulbous glass eyes . Light shone out the eyes and through a hole in the fish 's back . Taig art . The Sorg would never make anything so grotesque . Thinking this , Ahl went to sleep . <p> Waking , she felt the ship in motion . The fish was dark . Daylight came through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to the wicker chest , one hand on it . The men were not present . Had they slipped off in the night ? Were she and Leweli alone among male strangers ? A disturbing idea ! She rose and used the pot-for-urination , then went on deck . Perig and Cholkwa were there , leaning on the ship 's aide , watching blue waves go past . <p> " Good morning , Ahlin , " Perig said . " Cholkwa is a little queasy . I thought he 'd be better up here . " <p> " And you ? " asked Ahl . <p> " No kind of travel bothers me . " <p> She stayed a while with the men . For better or worse the journey had begun . There was a kind of relief in simply beginning . As to the end , who could say ? With luck , she 'd find Ki . <p> The first two days of the voyage were bright , with a strong wind blowing out of the north . Nothing could be better ! They sped toward Helwar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid that the Taig sailors would see through her disguise , afraid as well to leave the baby alone . <p> " A good actor and a bad traveler , " Perig said in explanation . " Poor Lewekh is often queasy , but if you could see him play a matron mourning the death of her male relations ! A stone would groan and grieve ! " <p> " I would like to see this , " said the Taig captain politely . <p> Ahl preferred to be on deck , listening to Perig tell stories about his acting career , though he never mentioned the trouble that had left him with one companion . <p> At night they had to share the same cabin . The two men slept on the floor , keeping as far from the women as was possible . They were not perverts , Perig said in a reassuring tone . " Neither one of us has ever touched a woman , except for close relatives when we were children . Nor will we . Men like us are never used to fulfill breeding contracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ? " <p> This was true , as Ahl realized . The most important male virtue is directness . How could an actor have this quality ? Surely  --  to do his work  --  he had to be devious . Nor did it seem likely that an actor 's life would encourage loyalty , the second male virtue . Always traveling , living a series of lies , how could men like Perig and Cholkwa be loyal , except possibly to one another ? <p> In thinking this , Ahl showed the prejudice of her time . Now we understand that honesty can manifest itself in more than one way , and that people can travel long distances from home without becoming disloyal . <p> But it was n't simply prejudice that made her think of actors as men of doubtful virtue . In those days acting was a trade halfway in shadow . Many actors were runaways ; and not a few were criminals : thieves and prostitutes , usually , though there had been one famous acting troop which supplemented its income with banditry . <p> " Understandable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said when he told Ahl about this group . " Eh Manhata caught them finally and told them to put on a play . Maybe they thought he 'd leave them alive , if they could please him . They did their best , and he had them all beheaded . It was n't a judgment on their acting , but it could have been . " <p> Were her two companions thieves ? Ahl wondered uneasily , then remembered that she was a thief and beyond question disloyal to her family . In addition she was pretending to be a man . Hah ! She was most of the way into darkness ! Maybe she ought to finish the job and become an actor , though women never did . <p> On the third day the wind shifted , blowing out of the west . Black clouds loomed there , lightning flashing around them : the first autumn storm . The Taig men reefed their sails . In spite of this the ship 's speed increased . The waves grew taller and changed color , becoming dark green with thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spray . " Get below , " the Taig captain said to them . <p> They obeyed . Leweli was in the cabin already , throwing up in a pot which had not been used till now . <p> " This is turning into a difficult situation , " Perig said . <p> " Yes , " said Cholkwa in a strange voice and found a pot of his own . <p> The cabin window was already shut . Ahl checked to make sure it was secure , then sat down . The ship was well-made , though not of Helwar quality ; and the crew were good sailors , the captain especially . Nonetheless they might go down . Such things happened . It was terrible to sit here quietly ! She mentioned to Perig that she was trained as a sailor . <p> " The captain sent us below for a reason , " he replied . " Respect his knowledge ; and remember how wet it is on deck . If you go up , your clothing will be soaked at once . It will cling to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman . " <p> This was true . Ahl tilted her head in agreement . Above her the fish lamp swung back and forth , casting shadows that danced over the walls . Leweli and Cholkwa were still throwing up . Perig sat on the floor , arms clasped around his knees , in a pose of patient endurance . Seeking distraction , Ahl opened the wicker chest . The child Dapple slept quietly , as if in the witch 's arbor . She laid a thick cloth over her legs for protection , then lifted the child out . How delicate the body between her hands ! How soft the fur ! How light the weight when she laid Dapple in her lap ! Ahl watched the baby sleep , the tiny chest rising and falling gently . The eyes were not perfectly shut . Now and then , when the lantern 's light shifted , a gleam shone between the gray lids . Hah ! It made Ahl feel tender ! As did the loosely curled hands , their nails uncut and curving over the fingertips like claws . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might work on full-grown people . At the moment Leweli and Cholkwa were both lying down . If they were making any noise , Ahl was not able to hear it over the sound of water rushing , the creak and groan of wood . But neither looked comfortable . <p> So . <p> Ahl laid Dapple in the chest , then filled the horn spoon with potion , bringing it to her cousin . Leweli glanced up , her expression despairing . <p> " Try this , " said Ahl , kneeling . <p> Leweli hesitated . The ship made a sudden loud noise and shuddered around them . That was enough . Leweli took the potion . <p> If that was the right dose for a child , then the mother needed more . Ahl went back to the jar . <p> When she finished with Leweli , she took the jar to Perig and explained her idea , speaking loudly through the ship 's noise . The actor smiled and carried the jar to his companion . <p> Leweli and Cholkwa dozed , looking more comfortable than before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to feel queasy . The jar of potion was still mostly full . She ate a spoonful . The flavor was medicinal , sharp and herby . Soon she noticed her body was relaxing . Instead of fear and nausea , she felt a pleasant drowsiness . She lay down , one hand on the chest where Dapple slept , dreamt of Ki and woke to a banging noise . <p> Was the ship breaking apart ? No , it was the Taig captain , beating on their door . The storm was as bad as ever , he told them . All the sails were gone , pulled down or blown away . Still the ship drove east , far off course already . " Pray for us , if you think the Goddess will listen ; and if you have charms or know any spells , use them now ! " <p> Then he was gone . The fish lamp swung back and forth . Looking across the cabin , Ahl saw Perig 's mouth moving . " Are you reciting magic spells ? " <p> " Speeches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praise of the Goddess , courage and luck . " <p> This did n't seem useful , but could hardly do harm . Ahl gave more potion to the invalids , the child and herself . Time passed . Now and then , among her dreams , she thought she heard Perig 's voice , speaking of honor and fate . <p> Finally  --  was it on the third day or the fourth ?  --  the motion and noise decreased . Perig left the cabin , coming back to say , " The captain thinks we 'll survive , though we 're far east of the route he planned for us ; and I have never seen an ocean like this one . ' <p> Ahl could n't stay put . Pulling a vest over her tunic , she went on deck . The smooth planks shone with water . The air tasted of moisture and salt . Looking up , she saw the main mast still intact , though loose ropes flapped around it , holding pieces of broken spar like fish in a net . <p> On every side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight it was ! But the ship was moving like a ship , climbing the dark blue slopes , sliding down into deep blue valleys . Before this , when the storm was at its worst , the ship 's motion had reminded her of an animal fighting as the butcher 's helpers dragged it into the butcher 's killing yard . <p> They were going to live . <p> The next day was cloudless . Ahl and Perig opened the cabin window and emptied the various pots . Nonetheless the cabin 's air remained less than pleasant . The two of them spent most of the day on deck . The waves had decreased in size ; and the Taig sailors put up a sail . <p> " We can steer now , " the Taig captain said . " Though not well . We have to put in for repairs . I 'm at the eastern edge of my knowledge , beyond all certain ports ; and we ca n't turn back and sail across this wind until the repairs are made . " <p> " Is that so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest . <p> " What then ? " asked Ahl . <p> " There are islands out here , " the captain answered . " I 've heard other captains describe them , and they 're marked on my maps , though this far out the maps are unreliable . Some are uninhabited , which would be fine . Others are inhabited by honest fishing people , which would be even better . What I 'm worried about is pirates . Also monsters , though I 'm not sure the monsters are real . There 's no question about the pirates . " <p> The day after , they spotted land . A sailor climbed the main mast . Coming down , he reported no signs of habitation . But there were plenty of trees and a broken coastline that might provide a harbor . <p> " We 'll try it , " said the captain . <p> At sunset they anchored in a little bay edged by sand . Beyond the sand were ledges of rough-looking , dark-brown rock . Trees grew atop the ledges , their foliage the color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though the harbor water was still and clear , the sky bright and almost cloudless . <p> They would spend the night on board , the Taig captain said . Was he simply being cautious , or did he feel  --  as Ahl did  --  that the island brooded and held secrets ? Being the captain , he did not have to explain himself . <p> In the morning men went ashore . They returned midway through the afternoon , having gone around the island . It was empty of people , though there were plenty of birds . The sailors brought back firewood and fresh water from a spring . Hah ! It was sweet to drink ! <p> " I do n't imagine you 'll be any help in repairing the ship , " the Taig captain said to Perig and Ahl . " But you can work on shore . We 'll need more wood , more water , and if any of you know how to hunt or fish  --  " <p> " Lew  --  " Ahl said and paused , then continued . " Lewekh is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marshes . " <p> " Cholkwa and I have lived off the land , " said Perig . <p> " Do what you can , " said the captain . <p> Cholkwa had no problem with this idea . But Leweli refused . " I ca n't leave the child alone . What if she wakes and begins to cry ? What if she becomes ill ? Men ca n't take care of children . " <p> " The child is healthy as a tsin and sleeps like a rock , " said Ahl . <p> " Usually , " said Leweli . " But I will not leave her . " <p> In the morning the three of them set off . It was another bright day . Small clouds dotted the sky . A mild wind blew , stirring the bronze-brown forest , making spots of sunlight dance over the ground . There were no trails . Obviously , no large animals lived on the island , though  --  as the sailors had said  --  birds were plentiful . So were edible plants , and Perig turned out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basketful . Ahl knew most , though he was especially happy with something she had n't seen before . " Tsin ears , " he called the plant . It was fleshy and looked like its name , except for its color , which was a reddish-purple . The plant grew on tree trunks , so it looked as if the trees had ears and were listening : an eerie sight . Perig cut them off , using a knife . The cut ends did not bleed , a relief to Ahl . <p> On the far side of the island was a moor , covered with low vegetation . The birds there were large and heavy , like the halpa which people raise on many parts of our home planet . Like halpa , they flew when startled , but only for a short distance . Then they dropped down and tried to run . <p> " This ca n't be called a sport , " said Cholkwa and shot one . <p> Seen close , it was covered with glossy brown feathers , except for its legs and feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas of bare skin on the head , circling the animal 's round yellow eyes , so it seemed to wear spectacles , though this image would not have occurred to Ahl . In her age spectacles were rare , and it 's likely that she never saw a pair . <p> " What do you think ? " asked Cholkwa . <p> " It looks like a halpa , " said Perig . " Except for the blue skin . Maybe it 's a relative . If so , it ought to be tasty , especially in a stew with my ears . " <p> They spent the midday killing birds . All had the same areas of blue skin . So it was n't a disease , a thought which had occurred to Ahl . When they had enough , Perig found a long straight branch . They fastened the birds to it by their bright blue feet and carried them back this way , Cholkwa at one end of the stick , Ahl at the other . The wind had died . Ahead of them a trail of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be heating pitch , " said Perig . " The ship was taking on water , the captain said . " <p> " How could it not ? " asked Cholkwa . " If I had known what kind of trip this was going to be  --  " <p> " We could n't stay in Sorg , " said Perig . " Nor return to the north ; and we have survived the journey . " <p> " Wait till we 've reached our destination before you say that , " replied Cholkwa . <p> They reached the inlet in late afternoon . The ship 's cook , a burly man with gray-brown fur , descended on them and seized their birds . Perig followed with his , sin ears . <p> Dinner was roast bird . The cook would use the ears tomorrow , Perig said . " The men are hungry . A stew takes time ; and tsin ears require special preparation . I have to say the birds taste fine roasted . I 'm almost certain they 're related to halpa . " <p> " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They could hardly fly . " <p> " Maybe they 've been here all along , " Perig said . " Placed by the Goddess when she made the world . " <p> " Or maybe people left them , " said Ahl , licking her fingers . <p> " That 's possible , " Perig admitted . <p> Most of the sailors stayed on shore that night , as did Perig and Cholkwa . Ahl suspected the two men were interested in sex , now that they were safe and could get away from their female companions . Nothing could be done in the cabin . No self-respecting male would do anything so intimate in a room containing women . But on a dark beach , surrounded by other men  --  She envied them and went back to the ship . <p> The next day the Taig captain said , " I 'm tired of your comrade 's laziness . What is his excuse today ? Sickness ? An unlucky omen ? " <p> " He still has n't recovered from the storm , " said Ahl . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on shore . You said he 's a good hunter . We need food , and he clearly needs exercise and fresh air . " <p> Argument was impossible . Leweli went with Ahl and the actors , though she looked unhappy and began complaining as soon as they were in the forest . <p> " Merhit is a good witch , " said Ahl . " I 'm confident her magic will keep the child safe . We have no choice , cousin . A captain must be obeyed . " <p> THIS TIME the birds were harder to find , but at noon they came on a flock , all grouped together in an open space on the moor , scratching with large blue feet and pecking . It was easy to kill as many as they were able to carry . Laden with their prey , they returned to the beach . <p> The pitch pot was turned over , and a black pool of pitch lay next to it . Bodies , the Taig sailors almost certainly , lay scattered on the sand . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flee ? Ahl glanced around . The forest was close , but not close enough . Ragged strangers moved toward them , holding bloody swords . <p> Perig stretched his arms out to the side . His hands were open and empty . " Obviously we ca n't fight you . But I ought to mention if you kill us , you will be killing a pair of women . " <p> " What do you mean ? " asked one of the men . His accent was thick , but Ahl could understand him . <p> Perig gestured . " Those two are women . " <p> The man frowned . " They do n't look it . " <p> " Ahl , pull off your tunic , " Perig said . <p> She did as he asked , dropping the tunic and unfastening the band that held her upper breasts . The moment she was bare , the men looked down . This was encouraging . In spite of being pirates , they had not lost all sense of right behavior . <p> " Put on your tunic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> She picked up the tunic and pulled it on . <p> " There is a baby on the ship , " Perig continued in his usual pleasant voice . " The other woman , the one holding the stick with birds , is the mother . I assume you 're planning to kill us or maroon us . But you can hardly kill women or maroon them with unrelated men . " <p> " How do you know what we can do ? " asked the man who had spoken previously . Most likely he was the leader . <p> The men around him looked uneasy . One said , " Jehan , " in a nervous tone . <p> " And why are these women traveling in disguise with men who are n't relatives ? " added the man named Jehan . " I know foreigners lack self-respect , but this seems worse than usual . " <p> " Why do n't you disarm us , which is the obvious next step , and then we can talk , " said Perig . " If you 've left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . " <p> Jehan swung his sword . Perig fell . <p> " Goddess ! " cried Cholkwa , falling to his knees beside his lover . Ahl was certain now . She heard love in the young man 's anguished voice . <p> Perig sat up , feeling his head . <p> " I used the flat , " said Jehan . " But if he keeps talking , I 'll use the edge . " <p> " He 'll be quiet , " said Cholkwa and stood , helping Perig up . His hands , on the older man , seemed as careful as if he were holding a fragile treasure : something made of glass and gold . <p> " Now , " said Jehan . " Give us your weapons . " <p> They went down the beach , still carrying their birds , surrounded by pirates . Now Ahl could see beyond the Taig ship . There was another ship , somewhat smaller , outside the harbor entrance , blocking escape . Obviously it belonged to the pirates . Squinting against the glare of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't tell if there were pirates on the Taig ship . <p> Clearly they held the beach and the remaining sailors on shore : a group of seven , two injured , one badly . The Taig cook was wrapping an already-bloody bandage around his chest . Guards stood around the prisoners , holding weapons that had belonged  --  Ahl was almost certain  --  to the Taig . <p> " Are the rest dead ? " asked Ahl . <p> " Some , " said the cook in an angry voice . " Most were on the ship , repairing the rigging . They are still there , guarding it against capture . " <p> One of the guards said , " My cousin Jehan thought it would be a good idea to attack from the land . That 's where you seemed to be , if your smoke was any indication . If we came sailing in from the west , you 'd see us and make preparations . Better to circle to the south  --  the island would hide us  --  and land a party in the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you by surprise . " <p> " It worked , " said Jehan stubbornly . <p> " We do n't have their ship , " said the guard . <p> " We 'll get it , " Jehan said . " In the meantime , we have dinner . " <p> " And two women , " said one of the other pirates . <p> " What ? " asked the guard . He was a stocky man with dark fur going silver over his shoulders . In Ahl 's opinion , he looked sensible , not a trait she associated with piracy . <p> " I 'm a woman , " said Ahl . " And so is she . " <p> " This is turning into a perplexing mess , " the guard said . " What are two women doing on a Taig ship , disguised as men ? Taig women do n't travel , and why would any woman disguise herself as a man ? Surely you know how dangerous it is ! We could have killed you by mistake . " <p> " Can I speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , " said the guard . " And have something useful to say . " <p> " He 's one for chattering , " said Jehan in a warning tone . <p> " Let him chatter , " said the guard . " I want information . " <p> " These two women needed to get south in a hurry and went in disguise , because they could n't find a women 's ship . " <p> " Are you related to them ? You do n't look similar . " <p> Perig hesitated briefly , then tilted his head in assent . " The women in our lineage are tall and have an authority we men lack . " <p> " Which lineage ? " the guard asked . <p> " Tesati , " said Perig . <p> " Not one I know . " <p> " It 's to the north , " said Perig . " At the edge of the Great Central Plain . Or rather it was there . The Unraveling has destroyed much . Another family overwhelmed ours . The men are dead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive ? " asked Jehan . <p> " We were n't home when the end came . Cholkwa and I are actors and often travel . " <p> " Actors ! " said the guard , looking interested . <p> " When we did come home , we found  --  " Perig smiled briefly . " No home . Our male kin were dead . The family that killed them , the Chaitin , had gathered in our female relatives and the children . We should have killed ourselves . It would have been the decent thing to do . But we found these two hiding out , along with Leweli 's baby . They did n't want to be Chaitin . There are women who hold this kind of grudge . " <p> Everyone was listening intently , of course . It was a good story , told excellently . But now Ahl saw a look of confusion on the Taig cook 's face , followed by a look of horror . The cook was remembering the night before , she thought . Perig and Cholkwa had made love on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undisturbed . Traveling companions often give each other this kind of comfort , provided they are the same sex and not related . But if the two actors belonged to the same family , the act was incest . The cook opened his mouth , then closed it and glanced down , going back to work on his injured comrade . <p> A near thing ! And not over . The cook might still decide to denounce the actors . <p> " Maybe we should have given our kinswomen to the Chaitin , " Perig said . " They would have been safer ; and there is always something offensive about the idea of women without a family . Such things happen to men . We know it ! But women should live inside a double wall of matriarchs and soldiers . <p> " These ethical problems are never easy to untangle . In the end we decided to rely on the old rule , which says that men should not make decisions for women . That power lies in the hands of their mothers and their female relatives ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since they had become Chaitin , while these two remained Tesati . They asked us to escort them south ; and we agreed out of loyalty , which is not the foremost male virtue . That , of course , is directness or honesty . But loyalty is one of the five . " <p> " I told you he talked a lot , " said Jehan . <p> " Are you really actors ? " asked the guard . <p> " Why would I lie ? " asked Perig . <p> " I 've never seen a play , " the guard said . Ahl heard longing in his voice . <p> " Well , then , " Perig said . " Let the Taig cook fix our birds . You can feast tonight and see The Death of Eh Manhata . " <p> " He 's dead ? " cried the guard . The other pirates made noises indicating surprise . <p> " What happened ? " asked Jehan . <p> " He was betrayed by men he trusted , captured and  --  " Perig stopped . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " It 's all very well for you to talk about waiting , " Leweli said . " But I have a child on board the Taig ship . I need to get back to her . " <p> " We ca n't let you go , " said Jehan . <p> " Why not ? " asked the silver-backed guard . <p> " For one thing , the Taig might be willing to surrender their ship in order to get these two women back , especially if they have a baby on their hands . " <p> " You are willing to hold women hostage ? " asked Perig in a shocked tone . <p> Jehan frowned and raised his sword . <p> " Do n't kill him , " said the guard . " I want to see the play . " <p> " For another , " continued Jehan , " we ca n't let the women tell the Taig whatever they may have found out about us . What if they 've realized how few of us there are ? And how difficult it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look of pain crossed the guard 's face . " Very well , " he said . " Keep the women here . " <p> The pirates untied the cook 's feet , so he could work , helped by pirates . Soon a new fire was burning , and the cook was eviscerating birds . As for Ahl and her comrades , they settled in the sand close to the Taig prisoners . The guard settled with them , obviously anxious to talk . His name was Jehan , he said , the same as his cousin . Though he was Jehan Silverback , and his cousin was Long Jehan . <p> " Long ? " said Perig . " He 's no taller than you are . " <p> " That is n't the way he 's long , " said Jehan Silverback , then looked embarrassed . " It 's hard for me to remember these two are women . " <p> " This is n't a situation where it 's easy to remember anything having to do with manners , " said Perig . " Though I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How did you end in this line of work ? " <p> He came from an island , said Jehan Silverback . " Where exactly I wo n't tell you , in case we decide to let you live . " It was one of two islands that lay remote from all other land . The guard 's family lived on one island . Another lineage  --  " our breeding partners "  --  lived on the other . Both islands were steep and stony , surrounded by rocks and shoals . Not much to look at , according to the guard , though his voice sounded affectionate to Ahl . " But the cliffs are full of nesting birds ; and the waters next to shore are so full of shellfish that they are like stones on a beach ; and there are plenty of fish . " <p> The problem was the islands were treeless . The islanders lived in houses made of stone and sod . Their fuel was driftwood and the oil of marine animals . <p> Lacking timber , they could not build boats . Without boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their neighbors . " We might not starve , since we could still net birds and gather shellfish . But how could we breed without boats to carry men from one family to the other ? We 'd die out , unless we were reduced to inbreeding . " There was horror in the guard 's voice as he said this . " We are pirates because we ca n't buy the ships we need . Nothing we have to sell is of sufficient value . " <p> " Could n't you cut timber on an island like this one ? " asked Ahl . <p> " We gather wood for ordinary uses on this island , " the guard said . " And we could make some kind of wretched little dinghy from the timber here . But a good ship requires large trees , metal tools and fittings , fabric for the sails , rope and w most of all  --  skill . " <p> " You want the Taig ship , " said Perig . <p> " Yes . We thought we were in luck when we saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that meant a ship , most likely one that had put in for water and repairs . The sailors would be tired from fighting the storm which blew them here ; they would be preoccupied by work , and they would not expect any trouble . Why should they , in a place this remote ? Things did n't turn out exactly as we expected . But we have prisoners , eleven of you now . If we ca n't take the ship by force , maybe we can strike a bargain . " <p> " It really does n't seem wrong to you , holding women and a baby hostage ? " asked Perig . <p> Jehan Silverback scratched his forehead . " It 's a difficult situation and not one we expected . No one lives in this part of the ocean except us and our neighbors . When ships come here , it 's usually to fish or hunt . The crews are male . What family would risk its women on work that is hard and dangerous and unpleasant , and which does not require any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a storm or a fish . " <p> There were , of course , many families whose women fished . But Ahl was not going to argue with this pirate , who seemed to have strong opinions about women 's work . Nor did she wish to bring up the worst danger of this region , the one that would almost certainly keep women away : murderous pirates . <p> " You have never encountered a women 's ship ? " asked Perig . <p> " To the west of here we have , " the guard said . " Not often , since we rarely go far into the narrow ocean . When we realize that a ship is crewed by women , we let it go with an exchange of greetings . We are not monsters ! My cousin is right . You talk too much . " <p> Perig said , " Let me go and help the cook . Then you 'll be free of my foolish questions . " <p> Jehan Silverback gave permission . The rest of them stayed where they were . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lamps began to glimmer on the two ships . This was a frightening situation , though not as frightening to Ahl as it would be to a modern woman . Having met the humans , we know that it is possible for a species to flourish in spite of behavior that our ancestors would find unthinkable ; and we wonder if our own behavior is fixed . Could our men turn into monsters like human men ? Could they turn on women and children ? Is it possible that violence has no natural limits ? <p> None of these questions occurred to Ahl , sitting on the darkening beach in another age . Instead she worried about the baby on the Taig ship . Surely it would wake soon , be hungry and cry . She worried about the possibility that her shipmates and the two actors would die , if not tonight , then tomorrow ; and she worried about the rest of this unlucky trip . Would they ever get to Helwar ? Would she ever see Ki again ? But she did not fear harm to herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At this distance in time we can not say . <p> As dark closed around them , the cooking fire burned more brightly . Working in a red glare , the Taig cook roasted birds , while Perig prepared his tsin ears . Dismembered , the birds went into an iron pot with water , the ears and herbs . <p> " This is something " said Jehan Silverback . " A proper feast and then a play . We never have events like this on our island . " <p> Soon there was food , halin , and fresh clean water , drawn from one of the island 's springs . None drank water , except the prisoners . <p> " Eat moderately , " Perig whispered as he settled next to Ahl . <p> " Why ? " she hissed . <p> " The ears have to be prepared in just the right way . If not , they are toxic . Not fatal , but I hope  --  " <p> A pirate glanced at them . Perig stopped talking . <p> He had poisoned the stew . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to be a long night , " her cousin whispered in answer . <p> While the pirates ate , Perig and Cholkwa consulted . Their costumes and props were on the Taig ship , so they borrowed from the pirates and prisoners : a long red ragged cloak , a stained yellow tunic , a staff with impromptu ribbons . They set torches on long poles in the sand and drew lines to mark a stage . <p> Then  --  the pirates full of food , but still drinking  --  they began . <p> This was The Death of Eh Manhata , Cholkwa announced . A true story , acted by men whose native home was on the Great Central Plain . " We have not lied . This story is the way things actually happened . " <p> The first scene was between Perig in the red cape and Cholkwa . Perig was Manhata : arrogant and confident , the greatest man in the world . Cholkwa was a younger relative , worried about his kinsman . He was too trusting , Cholkwa said . The men who sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . <p> Strutting back and forth , the red cape swirling , Perig said , " Nonsense . " <p> It really was remarkable . Perig , who had always been mild and reasonable , in no way formidable , now held everyone 's attention . It seemed to Ahl that he had grown in size . His stride was forceful . His voice commanded . Even the cloak had changed , becoming  --  how could Ahl describe it ?  --  richer and heavier , fit for a great leader , a warrior without equal . <p> In vain Cholkwa argued . Perig would not listen . Off he went to the foredoomed meeting . <p> Cholkwa left the circle of torchlight , returning shortly in the stained yellow tunic . Now he was one of the false allies , a wheedling plausible man , who had been  --  one sensed  --  handsome in his youth and was still in the habit of behaving seductively . <p> How did Cholkwa manage this ? His own good looks were mostly gone , and he seemed older . The stained tunic helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . The way he held himself ? His voice ? He did n't command attention like Perig ; and Ahl could still see him inside the character he played , the way one saw people inside festival dolls , when firelight shone through the stick and cloth bodies . Nonetheless , he impressed her . <p> Ahl leaned forward , intent . Around her the pirates and prisoners were silent . <p> At first Manhata was oblivious . The other man , the ally , praised , made promises , even flirted , though carefully . Manhata ignored the flirtation and accepted the praise , expecting nothing less . Gradually Cholkwa 's manner changed . Sharpness crept in . He began to mock the old warrior at the same time that he became more openly seductive . <p> A disturbing scene . Around her the pirates shifted and muttered . One stood up , stumbled into the bushes and threw up . <p> Understandable , though maybe it was the stew . <p> It took a long time for Manhata to understand what he was hearing . Finally he turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> The ally explained . The trap had closed . Manhata 's men , the guard he 'd brought with him , were dead by now . Manhata would join them soon . " You have lived too long and become a fool , deserving of a shameful death . I promise you , old man , that is the kind of death you 'll get . " <p> What happened next was impossible to understand . Perig barely moved , yet she could see every idea and feeling in his mind . Disbelief came first , then anger  --  a brief hot flash , then fear . How was this possible ? Manhata was fearless . As she watched , Perig grew smaller , collapsing in on himself like a festival doll at festival end , when the sticks that hold it up are folded . Now she saw Manhata 's age . He was more than eighty at the time of his death . His life had been one of constant violence . Who knew how many injuries he had endured ? Surely his body must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sisters , who had guided him through his long career , were dead . What was left for him , except his terrifying reputation ? <p> Courage was left . She could see that now , as the old man straightened , meeting the gaze of his former ally . <p> " Do what you will , " Manhata said . The pirates sighed . As they did , Perig stepped out of the torchlight . Cholkwa joined him . A moment later the young man returned wearing his own tunic . Now he was a messenger , bringing news of Eh Manhata 's death . He stood quietly , looking out at the audience , and described what happened next . It had been a bad death , long and deliberately painful ; and Manhata handled it less than well . The Man Who Broke Lineages was himself finally broken . Ahl had heard most of this before . It was no more pleasant a second time . Of all the brutal things done during the Unraveling , this was the worst . Around her the pirates gasped and groaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " His former allies wanted us to remember him this way , " said Cholkwa . " If he had died in battle or by some ordinary form of execution , his reputation would not have been diminished . But this  --  " <p> " You should have lied , " said Jehan Silverback . " You should have given him the death he had earned . How can you cooperate in something so contemptible ? " <p> Perig stepped back into the torchlight . The red cloak was gone . He was Manhata no longer . " Anyone can be broken , " he said in his ordinary , quiet , even tone , " No one escapes shame except through luck . This is something that Manhata may have forgotten , for a while at least . But he learned it at the end . <p> " That 's one thing to remember . The other is , his enemies are fools . " <p> " Why do you say that ? " asked Jehan Silverback . <p> " In old age , when he no longer had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that must be called foolish . This ca n't be denied . It 's true as well that his courage failed him at the end . <p> " But think of the rest of his life ! I 'm from the plain , as my cousin told you . For more than fifty years , Manhata rose above the rest of us like a thundercloud that would not dissipate . Every time we looked up , there he was  --  his head in sunlight and lightning around his shoulders . Can a year or two of folly , a day or two of pain unmake a life like his ? " <p> " Yes , " said Long Jehan . <p> " No , " said Jehan Silverback . <p> " Time will determine , " Perig said in his usual reasonable tone . <p> That ended the play . The pirates continued drinking . By now they were obviously intoxicated . Several more threw up , lurching past the prisoners into the forest shadows . Long Jehan grabbed Cholkwa 's arm , pulling him down on the sand beside him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't tell if Jehen Silverback had ordered him to do so or asked him . Maybe Perig was acting on his own , trying  --  like Manhata - to beg a better ending . <p> " I think it 's time for us to leave , " said Leweli quietly . <p> " Mother told me men were disgusting after they 'd been drinking for a while , " Ahl said in agreement . <p> Maybe they could say they needed to urinate , Ahl thought . That would get them to the forest . But no ruse was necessary . The pirate closest to them slumped over suddenly , his cup spilling from his hand . The next fellow over had already risen and was stumbling toward the Taig prisoners . Why , Ahl did n't know or want to know . She and Leweli rose together , stepping backward into the black forest shadow . No one called out . <p> Instead of entering the forest , they went along its edge , keeping in the shadow . Hah ! It was dark ! But there were stars above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beach ended , they clambered over rocks , going out on the promontory which formed one side of the harbor . Someone by the pirate 's fire was screaming . Ahl did n't think it was from pain or fear . <p> Finally , when they were a good distance from the beach , Leweli said , " This will do . " <p> The two women dove into the water and swam toward the Taig ship . <p> Remember that Sorg is marsh . No one grows up there without learning to swim . Ahl was excellent and Leweli even better . Side by side , they stroked through the cold still water , making no sound . On shore the pirates were shouting at one another . Had they discovered the missing women ? Or were they quarreling , as drunks will do ? <p> When they reached the ship , Ahl grabbed the anchor chain . It made a noise . A moment later she saw a shape above her , leaning over the ship 's side . Metal gleamed in starlight . <p> " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We escaped . " <p> Ropes came down . They climbed up . <p> " I hope you 'll be able to do something about that baby , " said the Taig captain . <p> " You found it , " said Ahl . <p> " Hard to miss it , once it began to cry . " <p> " I 'll take care of Dapple , " said Leweli and went toward their cabin . <p> Ahl stayed with the captain , telling him about the situation on shore . <p> " The actor tried to poison them , " he said , leaning on the railing and looking at the figures that moved around the pirate 's fire . " They do n't look dead to me . " <p> " He said it was n't fatal . They are certainly intoxicated , though that might be due to halin . " <p> " They do n't seem to be looking for you , which suggests an unusual degree of intoxication . Either they have n't noticed that you 're gone , or they no longer care . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could wait and hope they lose consciousness . But I think it 'd be better to move before the other pirates  --  the ones on board the pirate ship  --  notice something is wrong . Do you want to join the attack , or are you a woman like your friend ? " <p> " I 'm a woman , " said Ahl . <p> " How about the other two ? " <p> " Perig and Cholkwa ? They 're men . When I left , it seemed to me they were trying to seduce the two chief pirates . " <p> " With luck , that will prove distracting . I 'll leave some men here , in case the pirates on the ship decide to move . " The captain made a noise that indicated irritation . " This would be much easier , if I did n't have to worry about enemies on two sides . Not to mention a ship with damaged rigging . As the proverb says , when luck turns bad , it turns bad . " <p> " True enough , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found a knife . Leweli was nursing the baby , who was quiet now . <p> " The Taig men are going to attack , " Ahl said . <p> " In which direction ? " Leweli asked . <p> " Shore . " <p> Leweli tilted her head , regarding the child . " A hard decision . I 'm glad it 's not one I have to make . But the party looked as if it might become ugly . Maybe it should be broken up . " <p> Ahl went back on deck , carrying the knife . The Taig sailors were clustered on the landward side of their ship . After a moment Ahl realized they were lowering a boat . " Quietly , " said the captain to them . " Act with care . " <p> There was a soft splash as the boat hit water . The sailors climbed down and rowed away , their oars making almost no sound . <p> The remaining sailors posted themselves along the rail , some watching the shore , while others kept an eye on the pirate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy to bring the ship in at night with the tide low , but they could send a boat . The captain says you 're a woman . Why are you traveling in disguise ? " <p> Ahl said , " I ca n't tell the story now . Later , if we survive . " <p> After that they waited . The fire on the beach was burning low , and only a few figures remained around it . Most had wandered into darkness , though she could still hear them howling like sulin . <p> Finally , when she began to wonder if the Taig boat had sunk , a shout came over the water : sharp and commanding . Not a drunken howl . A battle call . <p> Men ran into the firelight , carrying weapons . The sailors around Ahl exhaled . " Hah ! Taig ! " <p> Behind her Leweli said , " The baby 's asleep at last . What 's going on ? " <p> " The battle has begun , " said Ahl . <p> They were too far away to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such things existed at this point in history , and she had seen them in the south . But the Taig ship did n't have one . The battle was small dark figures , meeting in dim light . There was more shouting , then a high shrill scream that did not end . <p> One of the Taig sailors said , " Do n't you think you ought to go below deck ? It ca n't be good for a mother to see this kind of violence . Or any woman , for that matter . " <p> " Is that what 's worrying your " asked Ahl . <p> " Of course not , " said another man . " We 're worried about our kinsmen on shore . But there 's nothing we can do about their situation . So my cousin here is taking the only action he is able to take . I have to say he 's right . It 's the reason our women do n't travel . No mother  --  or future mother  --  should watch while men kill each other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " If not to the milk , to the mind , " said a third man . " What kind of mothers are you two going to be after a trip like this one ? <p> Enough , thought Ahl . She and Leweli went down to the cabin . The porthole was open . She found she could see the beach . The fire had been scattered and was mostly out . She thought she could see motion , and there was still noise . Apparently the battle continued . <p> " How could I be a worse mother by traveling than by staying home ? " asked Leweli . " If I had stayed in Sorg , Dapple would have died . " <p> " Nothing men say about child-rearing is worth attention , " Ahl said . " I wish I could see more clearly . " <p> Finally  --  it must have been an ikun later  --  she heard noises on deck . The Taig sailors returning ? Or a pirate boarding party ? Leweli lay asleep . Ahl stood and pulled her knife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surely this meant it was the Taig sailors . Ahl relaxed , then grew tense again as the cabin door opened . She 'd forgotten to bar it . Too late ! <p> The actors entered , both unsteady . Perig 's tunic was tom , and Cholkwa had a bandage wrapped around one arm . <p> " That , " said Perig as he settled on the floor , " was the worst evening of my life . " <p> " You , at least , did n't have Long Jehan in your hands , " said Cholkwa . " Goddess ! ' He leaned against the open doorway . " Do n't get comfortable . We 're sleeping on deck . " <p> " Are you all right ? " Perig asked the women . <p> " Yes , " said Leweli . " It was a fine performance . " <p> " Which part ? " asked Cholkwa . " The lies Perig told about our history or the play itself or the way the two of us behaved with Jehan and Jehan ? " <p> " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Good , " said Perig . <p> " The play , " said Leweli . <p> " Wasted on louts , " said Cholkwa . " Get up , old man . " <p> Perig groaned , stood and searched in his baggage until he found a tunic , faded but clean and untorn . <p> " That will do , " said Cholkwa . " You need n't look pretty . There 's no one left to charm . " <p> " It 's over ? " asked Ahl . <p> " There 's still the pirate ship , " said Cholkwa . " But the pirates on shore are prisoners or dead . Perig needs sleep . So do I. " <p> Then they were gone . She 'd heard about the kind of mania that overcomes some men after battle . That must be what she 'd just seen , unless it was the effect of halin and the tsin ears . Cholkwa , who had always seemed a bit sullen , had shone with happiness , so beautiful  --  in spite of his rumpled fur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perig had seemed tired , nothing more . Maybe it was too soon for him to feel happiness . Maybe he 'd done too much . <p> That night she dozed rather than slept . Often she was awake , or in a strange state between sleep and waking . At dawn she went on deck . The Taig sailors were up , watching the pirate ship . <p> " Leaving , I think , " said the Taig captain . <p> Sails billowed out , filling with wind . The anchor went up , water dripping from it and flashing in the first rays of the rising sun . <p> " They 've decided to abandon their kin , " said one of the Taig sailors . <p> " What do you expect of pirates ? " said another sailor . The ship headed north and west , vanishing at last among the waves . When it was gone , the Taig captain said , " We need to spend another day here . I want the two of you  --  the women  --  to stay on board . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What we have to do on shore is not pleasant . " <p> Cremate their dead , Ahl thought , and kill the remaining pirates . Cremation did not bother her , though it took a primitive form in her era ; but the cremation of Taig men belonged to Taig men . The other activity was male as well . <p> " We 'll stay on board , " said Ahl . <p> Perig and Cholkwa went with the Trig men . Ahl and Leweli went to the cabin . The day had a mild wind , enough to carry the pirate ship away , but not enough to bring fresh air through the porthole . The room seemed stifling to Ahl . The baby fretted . " She misses her potion , " Leweli said . " But I 'm not giving her any more , unless she becomes impossible . " <p> The baby became impossible and got more potion . " Just a little , to make her quiet . " <p> Ahl went through her baggage and repacked everything , made sure her knives were sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred to me , " she said to a sailor . " If you build a fire for cremation , it may attract more pirates . " <p> " We thought of that , " the sailor said . " We wo n't cremate our men until we 're ready to leave . What the captain is doing now is questioning the pirates . When he 's done , they 'll be killed and buried . No reason to burn them . We do n't intend to take their ashes home . " <p> " I have n't heard anything , " Ahl said . <p> " Our men went inland with the pirates . The captain did n't want to bother you . Sound carries well over water , especially on a day like this . " <p> There were dark shapes on the beach , laid in a line . The Taig dead , almost certainly . One man stood by them , leaning on a spear . No one else was visible . A bright hot day . The air barely moved . Bugs would be gathering around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had . <p> Would it be pleasanter to be inland , torturing the captive pirates ? <p> Ahl shook her head , thinking life was full of difficult choices . <p> IN LATE AFTERNOON the sailors came back , Perig and Cholkwa with them . Ahl waited on the deck . Cholkwa looked sullen again , while Perig looked grim . <p> " That 's done , " the older man said . " The Taig know how to reach the pirates ' homes , though the pirates certainly did not want to give out the information . " <p> " Goddess , " said Cholkwa . <p> " They said they were n't going to harm you , " Perig told Ahl . " They let you go , they said , though my impression at the time was they had n't noticed your disappearance . Jehan and Jehan certainly seemed busy with other things . I do n't remember anyone coming to tell them that you were gone , though I was occupied at the time . " <p> " You should n't talk about such things to women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . " <p> " I was drunk . " <p> The sailors set to work on their repairs . Most looked grim , though a few seemed satisfied . The next day the ship was ready to go . They took it out of the harbor , anchoring where the pirate ship had been , then rowed back to burn their kinsmen . <p> This was done at night . Looking through the porthole , Ahl saw the great red glare of the funeral fire . The air smelled of wood smoke and burning flesh . By morning the fire was out . No smoke rose into the cloudless sky . The Taig let out their sails , going west and south over an ocean dotted with foam . <p> Once the island was gone from sight , the Taig captain called them all on deck . " I want to know the truth about you people . I 've heard one story about you which is obviously untrue ; and our cook says there 's another story , which you told the pirates . Is there a third story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced at Ahl . " Tell him what you know , " she said . <p> Perig did , describing how he and Cholkwa and been stranded in the country of the Sorg . " Like a luat trapped in a too-shallow lagoon . " Just when they reached desperation , the witch appeared and made her offer : money to go south , if they would escort two women in disguise . " It was wrong to do it , of course , " Perig said . " But we had no alternative . " <p> The Taig captain glanced at Ahl . " Why did you need to flee your home , escorted by unrelated men ? Surely this is shameful behavior . " <p> Ahl told her story : how the Sorg matrons had decided to kill five children in order to get out of a business contract . One child was left alive , the baby in the cabin . She and Leweli had decided to save it , advised by the witch who hired Perig and Cholkwa . " She said it was the right thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a bad place , " the captain said . " It 's too late in the season to turn back and risk more storms . In addition , if I returned you to Sorg , the Helwar would be angry ; and no one makes better ships than they . But if I take you to Helwar , as I intend to do , I 'll make bad enemies among your kin . Why could n't you let the child die ? The crime  --  if it is a crime  --  would not be yours , but would belong to your mother and the other matriarchs . It 's wrong to take on too much responsibility . " <p> " That may be , " said Ahl . " But it 's done . " <p> The cook , who had been listening said , " It 's my belief that those of us who were taken prisoner would have died , except for the actors ' cleverness . Now that I know they are not perverts and committers of incest , I can be grateful . Granted , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but every man is supposed to help women in need of help ; and healthy babies should not be killed , especially to escape from a business contract . Where will we be , if people do n't keep the agreements they make ? I do n't intend to tie my mind into knots by trying to make sense of this situation . Go with the simple solution , kinsman ! Thank these folk for their help , and deliver them to Helwar . " <p> " A good cook is always worth listening to , " the captain said . " I will take your advice . " <p> The ship continued west and south , carried by a mild and steady wind . Leweli spent most of her time in the cabin , caring for the baby , who was often awake , now that she no longer got the potion . Without the witch 's magic , the child proved as irritable as any ordinary baby . <p> " And maybe more so , " said Ahl to Perig while explaining why she spent most of her time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child from death and maybe ruin my own life by doing so ; but I will not listen to her cry . " <p> Several days later , Ahl asked , " Did the tsin ears work the way you expected ? " <p> " Not entirely , " Perig said . " If you peel them before cooking and cut off the base , they are an ordinary food , except for being unusually tasty . But if this is n't done , they cause visions , followed by stupor . In my home country diviners use them to look into the future . They wear headdresses in the shape of tsin ears . " Perig glanced sideways and smiled . " Foreigners think the headdresses are funny ; and maybe they are ; but the visions are often useful , though only if the person involved has been trained . " <p> " Was n't it dangerous to give something like that to pirates ? " <p> " The situation was dangerous already . The pirates were going to kill all of us , except possibly you and Leweli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the tsin ears , drama , sex  --  if the pirates wanted sex , as they obviously did . Anything to distract them and delay the moment of killing . I thought if they began to see visions or fell into a stupor , maybe we could escape . Or maybe the Taig sailors would attack , or the Goddess reach down her hand and lift us all to safety . Who can say ? " For a moment he was silent , looking out at the ocean . " If rd had the witch 's potion , I would have used it . But it was on the ship . I used what was at hand . " <p> Ten days later a sailor vanished . The ship was searched . He was n't found . <p> Perig told Ahl about it . " They think he went overboard last night . He was one of the men held prisoner by the pirates , a young man , good looking . " <p> Odd , thought Ahl . She did n't remember a good looking man among the prisoners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pirates approached him . He wanted nothing to do with them . It 's not a good idea to say ' no ' to a drunken pirate . For one thing , they wo n't listen . " <p> " He killed himself out of shame , " Ahl said . <p> " The Taig believe so , though it does n't seem to me especially shameful to endure what ca n't be prevented . Maybe he thought he could have behaved in a more disciplined and undemonstrative fashion . Or maybe he wanted the memories of what had happened to stop . He should have waited . Most memories grow less sharp in time . " <p> It seemed wrong for a man to die on his way home , in good weather , after danger was past . Was what he had experienced so terrible ? Had n't the two actors gone through something similar and made jokes about it ? She asked Perig about this , speaking carefully , since most men do n't enjoy discussing sex or violence with women . <p> Obviously Perig was under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she asked her question , it was rude . But he did reply , his tone courteous and more serious than usual . <p> " Remember how Cholkwa and I make our living . Actors spend most of their time traveling . Any business that is carried on away from home is risky . <p> " Remember also that no man can expect help in a foreign country . Especially , no man can expect help given freely . That is done for women and children , but a man is expected to pay in one way or another . Actors learn to do what is necessary ; and we make jokes about these necessary actions . Why not ? " <p> She thought she understood what he was saying , and it fit with everything she 'd heard about traveling players . They lived at the edge of morality . How could they feel shame in the same way as other men ? After all , they sold strangers the right to stare at them and said the most intimate things , which ordinary men would reveal only to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Was the Taig youth right to die ? " she asked . " Is that what a man of ordinary honor would do ? " <p> Perig glanced at her sideways . " One who is n't an actor ? I think not , though it is n't my business to judge any of the Taig . He should have waited and spoken with his relatives . It 's not a good idea to kill yourself without permission . Now his mother has lost a son and the men on this ship have lost a cousin . Did he have the right to deprive them of so much , because the world is not as safe and pleasant as he imagined ? " <p> A troubling conversation . Ahl was no longer sure she could disentangle right from wrong . The threads seemed knotted together . When she pulled on a bright one , she found something dark , while the dark threads often led to something as bright as gold or silver . <p> AHL PONDERED morality while the ship continued south . Looking around , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like towers stood at the horizon ; and there was an increase in the number of birds . Next came an island : a bald rock that rose straight out of the ocean , useless to anyone except the birds . Another island followed , equally bare and sheer . Finally they passed a fishing boat , wallowing home with as many fish as it could carry . The Taig sailors shouted and waved message banners . The fishers replied with their own shouts and flags . <p> " We 'll be in harbor before dark , " the Taig captain said . <p> Soon after that Helwar came into view . Its forested peaks rose into a wreath of clouds ; and mist lay in the upland valleys like handfuls of unspun wool . Off the north coast rain fell like a curtain made of gauze . Ahl 's mind filled with happiness . <p> One troubling idea remained . " I have a final question , " she said to Perig , as they watched Helwar approach . <p> " Surely you can stop asking questions now . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He was silent for a moment . " That 's my business . " <p> " It 's obvious that you and Cholkwa have a secret , " Ahl said . " I think I know what it is . " <p> " Do you ? " he asked . <p> " You have been lovers for a long time ; everything about you suggests as much ; and he 's still young . It would surprise me if he 's twenty-five . " <p> " You think I 'm a child molester , " said Perig . <p> " Well , " said Ahl . " I 've met every other kind of criminal on this journey . " <p> " It has n't been a lucky trip , " Perig admitted . <p> " How old was he when you met ? " <p> Perig turned , leaning his elbows on the rail and looking around to see who might be near . " What are you going to do with this idea ! " <p> " Nothing . You got us out of Sorg and saved us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have killed Leweli and me , or adopted us and taken us home to their miserable island . I will not repay you with harm . " <p> " Hah , " said Perig , the long slow exhalation which can mean anything . For a while he was silent . Ahl waited , her eyes on the cloud-capped island . <p> At last Perig said , " He was fourteen when he left home . His family had been destroyed in the war , and he refused to join the lineage that had killed all his male kin . " <p> " Was that family the Chairing ' asked Ahl . " Is he Tesati ? " <p> " Yes . I did n't know his family name at first , nor did he know mine . Actors use their personal names , so as not to embarrass their families . He was a beggar I found on the road , fed and cleaned and found to be lovely . <p> " I said he could stay with the company if he was old enough , but I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told me he was adult . He was n't lying by much . He 'd been on his own for almost a year by then . <p> " We were lovers before he reached his fifteenth birthday , and before he learned my family name . When he learned it , he tried to kill me , though it was n't a serious effort . I took the knife away from him , and he explained . " <p> " You are Chaitin , " Ahl said , not certain what she felt . Confusion ? Horror ! A need to laugh ? This is the kind of joke the Goddess loves to play : two-sided like a sword , with sharp edges that can cut to the bone . When the joke is especially fine , when the Great One brings it down like a blade on her victim , piety requires that everyone  --  even the victim  --  laugh . But Ahl had never been religious . <p> " Yes , " said Perig . " He 's angry at me for telling his story to the pirates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's always a good idea to stay close to the truth when lying . So I turned one fierce and stubborn boy into a pair of women , and I turned myself into a hero . Art is full of such transformations . " <p> " The cook was right . You are a committer of incest . " <p> " No , " he said firmly . " Cholkwa was never adopted by my family . Therefore what we did was not incest . But it would have been , if I 'd dragged him home and said , ' Here 's a cousin I found at the side of the road . ' The actors in my company knew what we 'd been doing . The story would have come into daylight ; and my hair goes up when I think of how my mother would have responded . <p> " In any case , Cholkwa did n't want to join the Chaitin , and I did n't want to give him up . " <p> " He stayed with you , after finding out who you were ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home , which is n't often . The rest of the time I 'm Perig the actor . The answer to your question is ' no . ' He ran away . I followed and dragged him back , partly because I knew how dangerous the plain was for someone like him  --  alone , without a family . But mostly because love had made me crazy . <p> " The second time he came back on his own . What else could he do ? Starve on the plain ? Live among criminals and learn to be like them ? I offered him safety and the chance to learn a skill more honest than robbing travel ers . " <p> " And this is what broke apart your company ? " <p> " After so many years , " Perig said in admission . " I really thought we could hide the secret forever . But we do n't always get along . We had a quarrel which was overheard . When Cholkwa has been drinking , he drags the past forward . The actor who overheard us is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was incest . In addition , I had robbed our family of a child who had grown up to a perfectly acceptable young man . Even worse , my cousin had been interested in Cholkwa , though nothing had happened . Imagine how he felt ! He had been on the edge of perversion without knowing it ! <p> " Of course he made a lot of noise , and the other men decided the company was unlucky . That was true enough . I ca n't blame them for going . <p> " I do n't think my cousin has a future as an actor . He 's stiff as a plank and far too moral . It was a mistake to take him into the company . But when a relative asks a favor , it 's difficult to refuse . " <p> Ahl looked at her hands , almost seeing the tangle of darkness that filled them . Perig was wrong about his lover . A man could be kinless . So could a woman , though it was n't common . But every child must have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lineage was gone ; and no other lineage had adopted him . Therefore he was Chaitin or had been until his fifteenth birthday . When the two of them first had sex , it was incest and the molesting of a child , but only by a few days , twenty or thirty . How could wrong behavior be a matter of timing ? She asked Perig this question . <p> " Everything is a matter of timing , " Perig said . " When the witch came with her offer , I thought , ' What fine timing ! What excellent luck ! ' " He gave Ahl a sideways glance . " If you keep quiet about our story , this may still be true . Cholkwa and I can still recover . " <p> " I have already promised to cause you no harm , " Ahl said . " I want this journey to end . Too many bad things have happened since I left Helwar . I 've learned too many things I did n't want to know . " <p> " You would ask questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All I want now is Ki and a safe place to stay . " <p> Perig turned , looking at the cloudy island . " You have almost reached safety . With luck Helwar Ki will be waiting . " <p> As the fishers had promised , they were in harbor by sundown . The two women hurried onshore , Dapple in Leweli 's arms . By nightfall they were in a great house , surrounded by matriarchs , telling the story of Sorg 's betrayal . Ki was there , leaning over the back of her mother 's chair , looking both grim and happy . Even in the midst of her dark narration , Ahl felt happy as well . <p> When the story was done , a matriarch spoke . Large and solid , well into middle age , she still had her baby spots . Her son had fathered Dapple , though the women from Sorg did n't know this . " If Sorg wants to escape our alliance so badly , let them go ! It 's no loss , since they have shown themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people enter into a contract , intending to break it ? What kind of people breed children , knowing the children have no future ? <p> " We need to tell everyone in the narrow ocean about this behavior . No one should trust the Sorg , and no one will , once this story has traveled . As for the child , it 's my advice that we adopt her and her mother . " <p> Gray eyes met blue-gray eyes . One by one , the women of Helwar tilted their heads . A quick decision , you may say . Remember how angry the Helwar must have been , and remember that every child must have a family . <p> Leweli was invited to stay in the great house , along with Dapple , but Ahl went back to the Foam Bird with Ki . A fine rain was falling , dimming the lights of Helwar Town . The ships in harbor seemed ghost-like , though the Bird 's deck was solid enough , once they set foot on it . <p> Ki 's cabin was exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's large bed . Made of carved wood , it was fastened to the wall and floor for safety in turbulent weather . The hanging lantern was too fine to change . Five luatin curled around a bronze bowl . Their eyes and teeth were gilded . One held a silver fish in its mouth . Another held a bronze harpoon no longer than Ahl 's smallest finger . The weapon was broken ; a torn rope  --  made of twisted gold wire  --  flew out from it . Who could say what had happened to the luat hunter ? <p> In the lantern 's bowl a seed oil burned , aromatic and bright . <p> " Nothing is missing , except your belongings , " said Ki to Ahl . " You can bring them tomorrow . " <p> They drank halin . Ahl spoke of her journey : the storm , the pirates , the actors ' cleverness . <p> " And courage , I should think , " said Ki . " It must have been frightening to act in front of criminals . As for deliberately seducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morality would push one back . " <p> " Maybe , " said Ahl in a tone that lacked conviction . According to Perig , his motivation had been fear of death , rather than courage ; and she doubted that ideas about morality had much effect on either man . <p> " You owe them a lot , " said Ki firmly . " As do I and all the Helwar . " <p> This was true . Ahl tilted her head in agreement . <p> They moved on to other topics , then into Ki 's large bed . Tangled with her lover , smelling and tasting Ki , Ahl forgot  --  for a while  --  her uncertainty ; though the person she had been , the always confident daughter of Sorg , was gone ; and never , in a long life , did she regain her family 's absolute , unquestioning self-assurance . <p> THE REST OF THE STORY can be told quickly . Ahl refused adoption , since it would end her romance with Ki . Instead she remained Sorg until her kin disowned her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , adopted her as a courtesy . For the rest of her life , she was Hasu Ahl , though she visited her new family only rarely , preferring to stay with her lover and Leweli . <p> Perig and Cholkwa formed a new company and brought northern theater to the Great Southern Continent . Previous to this , the southerners had told stories through a combination of narration and dance . The new style was recognized everywhere as an improvement . To actually see heroes , as they struggled ! To hear their voices ! To have their anguish made so vivid that it could be felt ! This was something ! <p> The two men remained lovers , though their relationship was difficult . At times they quarreled so badly that one or the other left the company . During one such period , Perig came to Helwar . Cholkwa was on the continent , in a far southern area where the people were barely civilized , but great lovers of drama , especially the comedies for which ( it turned out ) Cholkwa had a gift . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ahl . " I never thought Cholkwa would do so well dressed up as an animal with an erect penis . As we age , we learn who we really are . But , " he added , while turning a cup of halin between his hands , " the plays are really clever . Cholkwa can write comedy . Who can say , maybe it 's more difficult than the kind of writing I do . " <p> After he drank some more , he said , " The problem is the secret we share . One should never base love on something which must be hidden . It 's like building a tower in a bog . Nothing is solid . Cracks run everywhere . " <p> " You could live apart , " said Ahl . <p> " And you could leave Helwar Ki . " <p> In the end , the actors formed two companies , but remained acknowledged lovers . They organized their tours so they met often . Towns vied to be their meeting place . Even in later years , when there were many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a tragic hero or Cholkwa for humor . <p> As for Dapple , she was given the name of Helwar Ahl and used it while growing up . But after she was an adult , she became interested in acting and formed the first women 's company anywhere . Even now women in theater , actors and playwrights , call her " mother " or " the originator . " <p> Because acting was a dubious activity in those days , especially for women , she went back to her baby name . In this way , the Helwar were not embarrassed . Nor was her aunt Ki 's lover . <p> Nothing remains of the plays written by Perig and Cholkwa , but we have fragments of Dapple 's work . No one has ever written more beautifully in her native language ; and much of the beauty remains in the various translations . There are many of these . As the witch predicted , Dapple became famous . Even now , after centuries , her words are like diamonds : pure , hard , angular , transparent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eleanor Arnason is the author of such novels as To the Resurrection Station , Daughter of the Bear King , and A Woman of the Iron People , which won both the lames Tiptree , Jr .
