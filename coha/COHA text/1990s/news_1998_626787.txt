<p> Plight of America 's elderly <p> Regarding the July 12 Outlook article by Judy Minshew , " An interesting job , even with a letter too sad to print , " some people are very good at writing painfully sad letters . <p> Probably the letter writer is unhappy because she got old and sick and is poor . Society ca n't do much to turn back the clock . <p> What does the letter writer need now ? She does n't say , but hopefully the Sheltering Arms caseworker will evaluate the couple 's needs and help them access the system . This will take time and patience . <p> The comment that the elderly are " totally stripped of intelligence and dignity " is a gross exaggeration . People who need help first have to be specific as to what they need . <p> They should contact their state representative or state senator 's local office by phone or letter . In most cases , if the need is stated specifically enough , they 'll get some help . <p> The elderly are the luckiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , primary-home care , nursing-home care , etc . Most services have no waiting lists . <p> For children who are ill , there is a lot less available , and usually a long waiting list for most programs . For the middle class there is even less - you are on your own until poor . <p> Every other industrialized country has universal health care . Is the whole world nuts or is something wrong with our thinking ? <p> One of the non-joys of living long enough to get old is that there 's no one left who remembers you when you were young . <p> Sam Perlin , Houston <p> The July 12 Outlook article about the elderly couple touched my heart . I hope it was read by many , for this problem is the rule , not the exception . So many seniors have outlived their support group of family , friends and neighbors . <p> In my opinion , the Sheltering Arms is one of the most caring organizations I 've run across . <p> I am a 78-year-old and I go there one Friday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their era . It is heartwarming to watch them listen , sing along and even dance to the music . <p> I know I ca n't solve their financial or health problems , but for one hour they are young again . <p> Rose Greene , Houston <p> I see only two solutions to elderly suicides . First , hospitals will have to cut their outrageous costs for treating them and , secondly , we will all have to care more about those less fortunate than us . <p> Betty Garrett , Bedias <p> The plight of the elderly in the United States is shameful . I have seen several seniors trying to decide which grocery item they would have to put back in order to afford the few meager items in the bottom of their cart . Seniors in my apartment complex living on fixed incomes agonize over whether they will be able to afford the yearly rental increases . <p> Other countries revere their elderly , while Americans , rich in everything except empathy , hide them away in a corner . <p> Vickie Schmidt , Houston <p> Objectivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " Not all cultures are created equal , " ( Edwin Locke , Outlook , July 5 ) : A blue bird tells you he is the most beautiful bird in all the world because , as he claims , blue is simply the best color to be . Likewise , Locke asserts that Western culture is superior to others because of its focus on reason , individuality and technology . <p> Why is individuality a superior cultural attribute to a focus on communities ? We believe it because we have been taught that . Why is technology superior ? Because we grew up with it . Our life expectancy is longer than in the past , but our quality of life may not be as good . <p> In so-called traditional societies , people have more leisure time and do not worry about things such as taxes , inflation , pollution , spending money , " keeping up with the Jones , " gun control , killer youth , etc . Would these cultures be happier with air-conditioning ? I do n't know . I know I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It 's ludicrous for Locke to claim objectivity when comparing cultures . He is representative of the kind of thinking that led to slavery and concepts like the " white man 's burden " : Western ( white , of course ) culture is better , so we need to spread it and enlighten backward-thinking societies ; if we need to use force , it will be for their own good . <p> The 19th century is gone , let 's move on , please . <p> Wesley Cordova , Houston <p> Thanks to the Chronicle for running Edwin Locke 's July 5 Outlook article , " Not all cultures are created equal . " Finally , someone has the backbone to state the obvious , however politically incorrect it may be . <p> Despite what anthropologists would have us believe , cultures are not merely different from each other . Cultural practices , it is true , do embody a certain value system . It is also true that values are open to debate , but only to a degree . <p> Surely most rational people would agree that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more freedom to do as one pleases is obviously better than less freedom . For this reason , Taiwanese culture is better than the culture of mainland China . Likewise , the culture of modern-day Germany is superior to that of Germany during the late 1930s . For the same reason , cultures that do not practice slavery are better than those that do . <p> To maintain that all cultures are equal is to imply that cultural and , therefore , social change is impossible . <p> Randal Jones , Houston <p> Truckers need restraining <p> How many trailer-truck accidents will be necessary before a law will be enacted to keep all trucks in the right lane while going through the city limits ? Since the truck speed limit is not enforced , at the least we should restrain them to the right lane within high-traffic areas . This would prevent weaving in and out and hopefully help keep them within the speed limit . <p> Karen Plummer , The Woodlands <p> Forfeited their right to live <p> The July 7 Viewpoints letter from Ward Larkin was a profitless exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death penalty is deterrent or incapacitating ? The real purpose of the death penalty is the moral fact that the person convicted has forfeited their right to live . The simple fact that there is no deterrent effect to criminal actions by imprisonment is overlooked by the foes of the death penalty . <p> James S. Melbert , Houston <p> Teen program worth more <p> In response to the June 25 article , " Council nixes youth program , " I commend Mayor Lee Brown for his enthusiasm for his summer youth-enrichment program which demonstrated his interest in our children . But I agree that the program also clearly violated the separation of church and state . Brown said he wanted to keep teens off the street , yet he failed to recognize that the city can not afford to get tangled up with churches . He wanted this " flaw " to be overlooked by the Houston City Council . Yet , how could it ? The program needed much more than three-weeks ' worth of work . <p> Maria Reyes , Houston <p> KODA 's reply to tragedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant about Houston is the extraordinary civic pride and interest in helping those less fortunate . I particularly applaud radio station SUNNY 99.1 ( also known as KODA ) for their fund-raising efforts on behalf of 8-year-old Robert Middleton who was set on fire and is going to require many months and even years of healing . The station brought many Houstonians together to raise money for Middleton 's medical needs . I am also encouraged to put my parenting , musical and other talents to use and to seek an outlet for my interest in helping others . Thanks to KODA for setting this example and helping the community rally in response to this tragedy . <p> Lenni Sanders , The Woodlands
