O Iraqis ! Yes , you triumphed when you stood with all this vigor against the armies of 30 states ! You triumphed while emphasizing your ability to face the showdown and confrontation ! You have recorded for Arabs and Muslims bright pages of glory that will be remembered for generations ! <P>  --  Baghdad Radio , following the Feb. 28 cease-fire <P> That report was a blatant rewriting of history . Across Iraq , the shattered hulks of planes and tanks lie strewn across airfields and battlegrounds . Power stations , telephone and telegraph centers , oil refineries and factories have been reduced to smoldering ruins . Dozens of bombed bridges are slumped into the Tigris and Euphrates rivers . Tens of thousands of Iraqi soldiers , as well as an unknown number of civilians , are dead . Many thousands more are either prisoners of the allied forces or straggling abjectly back to Iraq without their weapons . If this was victory , it is impossible to imagine what would constitute defeat . <P> Sooner or later  --  and probably sooner  --  Iraq 's 19 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miscalculation was . When they do , Saddam could face a fearful reckoning . The U.S. and its allies have made no secret of their desire that Saddam be overthrown by his own people . Most experts in Washington and other capitals say Saddam may be able to hang on , at least for a while , because he has so ruthlessly eliminated his internal rivals . But there was speculation that Saddam might flee . At week 's end there were rumors that he might seek political asylum in Algeria , although officials there denied it . <P> Saddam 's ouster or exile would end a bloody chapter in Iraqi history . But the one that follows could be just as sanguinary . In a country that has experienced five coups since 1958 , Saddam 's 12 years in power are a record . His Baath Party has imposed stability through control of the army and a network of secret police and informers that penetrates every niche of Iraqi society . If that is swept away , simmering tensions between the Shi'ite Muslims ( 55% of the population ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could conceivably erupt into a communal bloodbath , fragmenting the country into another Lebanon . <P> That may be one argument for accepting Saddam 's continuation in power , provided he has been weakened to the point that he can no longer threaten neighboring countries . The gulf states have an interest in maintaining Baghdad 's sovereignty : a fragmented Iraq could give a resurgent Iran the chance to dominate the region . For the allies , the issues of putting Saddam on trial for war crimes and of Iraqi payment of reparations to Kuwait still need to be settled . Although he remains a hero to many of his followers , Saddam has probably ceased playing an effective role in Arab politics . Even such supporters as Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organization are distancing themselves from Saddam in defeat . <P> It is hard to see how such a Saddam could ever be an international threat again . Alive , paradoxically , he is less of a hero than dead . His army is broken , his country is a shambles , and he has virtually no links to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lift the economic sanctions fairly soon , the arms embargo will probably last as long as Saddam is in power .
