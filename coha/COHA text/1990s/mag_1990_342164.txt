MONROVIA  --  The murderous civil war in Liberia has reached so volatile a state that on my first day in Monrovia , the capital , I found myself on both sides of the fighting without ever having changed position ; suddenly the struggle swirled around my companions and me and engulfed us . President Samuel K. Doe , the man whose ouster rebel forces sought when they began fighting 10 months ago , has been dead for six weeks , but violence , hunger and general chaos continue to hold Liberia in a bloody embrace . An estimated 10,000 Liberians , most of them civilians , have been killed since the war began  --  and more are dying every day . <P> I went to Liberia at the invitation of rebel leader Charles Taylor , the man who last December launched the campaign to topple Doe , a former army master sergeant who had seized power a decade earlier . In January part of Taylor 's National Patriotic Front of Liberia ( N.P.F.L. ) broke away and formed a separate faction led by Prince Yeduo Johnson , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captured , tortured and then killed Doe on Sept. 10 , but about 1,000 of the slain President 's followers still hold the executive mansion in Monrovia and are fighting on . A 6,000-man , five-nation West African peacekeeping force , strangely named the Economic Community Monitoring Group ( ECOMOG ) , began to arrive in Liberia in August but has been unable to stop the shooting . In fact , it has become actively involved in the war , mounting , in conjunction with Prince Johnson 's forces , air and ground attacks on Taylor and his rebels . <P> We arrived in Monrovia in the middle of the night aboard a creaky Fokker civilian plane flown by Burkina Faso air force pilots . Also aboard were four military advisers to Taylor 's forces from Burkina Faso and two other journalists . When we touched down at Robertsfield , the national airport , the plane 's window shades were pulled down by the crew , and the airport lights were doused as soon as the aircraft 's engines were switched off . <P> We were taken to see " President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small town in central Liberia , then a four-hour drive from the fighting lines in Monrovia . Inside his headquarters , formerly a Doe country residence that is guarded by female soldiers , Taylor , 42 , appeared wearing an ECOLOGY NOW T shirt , fatigue pants and a pistol in a shoulder holster . Despite setbacks suffered by his 10,000-strong forces in skirmishes with ECOMOG troops , he vowed that he would not give up the fight . " Look here , " he said , pointing to a map of Liberia . " This is all ours  --  except for this little piece called Monrovia , and we are going to keep on fighting as long as one foreign ECOMOG soldier remains on our soil . " The damage inflicted on Liberia by ECOMOG artillery fire and aerial bombing , which is carried out by Nigerian air force planes , he claimed , amounts to $4.5 billion . " The Liberian people are going to be bitter against their neighbors for a long time , " he continued . " They are finding it hard to accept being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
