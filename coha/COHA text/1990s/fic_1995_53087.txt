" His fingers , they noticed , were ever straying As if impatient to be playing . . . " <p>  --  Robert Browning The neighborhood 's north boundary was East 82nd Street . When I was growing up , I 'd watch the black kids play basketball there , on the pavement inside the eight-foot fence around Saint Malachy 's church and Catholic school . The priests left the gate unlocked from sun-up to dinner time . There was never any trouble there , no drugs , no blades or guns , no gang members showing colors . Not on the church grounds . The priests just figured there 'd be no trouble , and there was n't . <p> I saw Saint Malachy 's in the newspaper last week . I think I did . One of those helicopter photos , and not a real high-up picture like the ones the LAPD helicopters take . It was low , a Times shot . The crazy-mother journalists feel it 's their life duty to keep taking those pictures . If you ask me , the cops got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The photo showed seven towers on what used to be the Saint Malachy 's grounds . You could make out the pole for the basketball hoop , still there west of the rectory . Three of the towers looked finished already , sprouting out of the skeleton frame of the church like accidental steeples . They 're like the hundred or so other towers around the old neighborhood : tall , rungy , like concrete spider webs pulled from the middle on up toward the sky , and decorated with dishes , stop signs , soda cans . Other bizarre stuff . <p> Bizarre stuff . . . the stuff you mention last . Like the tower at the comer of 10th and Compton , made up all of skulls . That one 's forty-five feet high . And the one at Imperial and Avalon , the one called Las Munecas . Dolls , hundreds and thousands of them , cemented into the pipe and chicken-wired struts  --  stuffed dolls , rag dolls , china dolls , Cabbage Patch dolls , and every race , shade , color and creed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , but I like to think that Mr. Pietr had my brother Luis help build that one , the tower Las Munecas . That would be fitting . That would have made Mama proud . <p> I still hear him sometimes . Not my brother Luis , but Mr. Pietr . And not just at night , either . <p> " Jose , " he says . " Jose , come build the city . " And there 's the music , the sweet , sweet , goddamn music behind his words . And the only thing holding me back is remembering I do n't call myself Jose . Me Ilamo Joey . Eso es , si que es . <p> The Save-Our-Cities lady started shouting at the man from the LA Mayor 's office . Mama was up there on stage behind them , and I saw her pinch the bridge of her nose . She picked that up from television ; one night she 'd pointed it out to me , how tense people on TV always pinched their noses , and after that she always did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also sitting on stage , noticed her pinching , and two of them mimicked her . I do n't think they realized why they were doing it . <p> Mama had that sort of influence . <p> " Millions of dollars are pumped into areas like Beverly Hills , Park La Brea , and West Hollywood , while this community rots of neglect ! " The Save-Our-Cities lady was a white woman with stringy red hair and a baggy T-shirt . <p> Besides Mr. Pietr , my seventh-grade teacher , she was the only white person in St. Malachy 's community hall . It was hot , and the hall was way too small for the hundred or so of us packed in there . A couple of ceiling fans turned slow enough that I could count the separate blades ; they spun useless and lazy , twisting the heat around for us . <p> " Los Angeles County and the federal government have invested heavily in this area . " The man from the Mayor 's office talked quieter than the lady . " My participation here tonight is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movements like these encourage us to continue our investments . " He was a black man , and even at thirteen I could imagine the conversation downtown . " Fringe of the Watts area , " some white politician would have said . " Better send a Black or a Mexican . We got any free ? " <p> I did n't want to be there that night , but Mr. Pietr told us it might be a good idea . He said we should show our support for the South Central Drug-Free Zone effort . The way Mr. Pietr said it meant he might not play the pipe for the class if we did n't show up . Everybody from my seventh grade class was there . <p> " Invest ! " The Save-Our-Cities lady had a shriek like a bus braking on a wet day . " You call the Watts Shopping Center an investment ? How many people here in this hall do you think can actually afford to shop there ? You have no idea , do you ? " <p> I wondered if she had any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , had brought the woman in as a guest speaker for the meeting . I 'd never seen her before , and she 'd probably never be back . Not to shop , not to live here , not for nothing . <p> People from the crowd started yelling out their own opinions , but the Mayor 's man stayed calm . " Since 1990 , nearly fifty million dollars have been invested in the Fifteenth District and surrounding areas . We 've used HUD allocations to create seven immense housing projects , two additional senior citizen centers for . . . " <p> He hesitated because the audience shut up , all at once . He saw why when he looked to his left , our right : Mama had stood . Father Galloway , with skin like nighttime and a permanent face of worry , stepped in front of the Save-Our-Cities lady to talk through her microphone . " If we could yield the floor for a moment , I believe La Viuda de Hernez has a comment to make . " Most everybody still called Mama that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was five years since my father got killed down on Imperial . Mama liked being called La Viuda . <p> She did n't use the microphone . " Fifty million dollars since 1990 . That would be eight years . Mr. Pietr , how many people would you say live in the Fifteenth District ? " <p> All our heads turned to find Mr. Pietr . He was n't hard to spot , tall , lanky , and paler than any Anglo I 'd ever seen . Mr. Pietr stood to answer , the way he made us do in class . " I would guess around forty thousand , Senora . " He said senora funny , all swallowed and white-like . <p> " That seems to be an arithmetic problem , does n't it ? " Mama said . " I wonder how much that would be just for me , just for one day . " <p> More movement in the audience  --  Zane Gerard , Lucinda Ramirez , Tyque Raymond , everybody else from my class shifting all nervous because they knew what was coming . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had n't disappeared in a slouch . <p> " Jose Hernez , " he said . <p> I hated when people called me Jose . <p> I stood . <p> " Could you solve that problem for us ? " <p> I caught the Mayor 's man rolling his eyes . The Save-Our-Cities lady looked distracted , maybe a little confused that she was no longer the center of attention . Mama had a smile , tight and proper . <p> I closed my eyes and listened for it . I could remember the exact tune , the pipe song for math class . I could see Mr. Pietr playing , I could feel the breeze blowing numbers all around me , and I saw the right numbers lining up and behaving themselves for me when I told them to . Fifty million dollars was divided by eight years , which was split for forty thousand people in the Fifteenth District , and a portion I gave to my mother who I saw bubble apart into three hundred and sixty-five days , all in a rectangle of seventy-three rows by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make them float neatly . I reached out , took one bubble , and read it . <p> I opened my eyes . " Forty-two cents , plus eighty-one one hundredths of a penny if you round up . " I checked over to Zane Gerard . He was nodding at me . I knew that even though it was n't his math problem , he could n't resist working it , too . None of us wanted to resist . Behind Zane Gerard , Tyque Raymond was thumb-upping me . <p> " Course , I did n't count leap years , " I said . The man from the Mayor 's office did n't seem to know what to say to that . I watched Mama digging through her big wicker purse . She pulled out two quarters , walked over to the Mayor 's man , and pressed them into his palm . " You can have today 's investment back . You have n't done anything for me today . " <p> That broke the crowd 's quiet . People hooted , yelled insults , even tossed quarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's feet . The seventh grade class of Saint Malachy 's school sat still , doing nothing shouting nothing , tossing nothing . I glanced at Zane , at Tyque , at Lucinda , Marialuz , Jamal , Manuel , Bobby , Tamara . They were all remembering it , just like me : the pipe song for quiet , for staying calm and not joining in trouble . I looked back toward Mr. Pietr ; the fingers of his right hand tapped restless on his left forearm , like he was anxious , real anxious , to play . <p> The meeting broke up . Mama , the Save-Our-Cities lady , and Mr. Pietr talked together on stage in a tight huddle , while Father Galloway hurried all anxious through the crowd , blessing everybody and wishing them goodnight . Me and Zane and Tyque stood by the hall doors . Zane had his arms crossed and looked mean . Tyque jittered and bounced on his toes . Tyque was always touching things  --  walls , light switches , people 's arms , like if he did n't keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Earth . <p> When most everybody was blessed and leaving , Zane asked , " We going out ? " <p> " Got ta tell La Viuda . " <p> " He 's gon na tell La Viuda first , " Tyque told Zane . Zane smirked . <p> Before I could walk over to the stage , the Mayor 's man stepped in front of us . This close , he was a hell of a lot bigger . I did n't know he 'd stayed around . He was all by himself , no huddles like Mama 's and no blessings from Father Galloway . " Hello , boys , " he said . <p> " Yuh , " said Zane . <p> " I 'm Mr. Curtis . " Tyque jiggled in his direction . " Hi , Mr. Curtis . " <p> " Are the three of you friends ? " <p> Zane scowled , and I thought it was a stupid question , too . " Yuh , " Zane snapped , " cause we sure as hell ai n't blood . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my shoulder four or five times . " We bad , we beat , but we ai n't blood ! We bad , we beat , but we ai n't blood ! " <p> Our motto . <p> Nothing frazzled the Mayor 's man . " Dr. Martin Luther King dreamed of a day when children of different races would play together and live side by side  --  " The man was playing teacher . <p> " ' That one day on the red hills of Georgia , " ' said Zane , and Tyque hummed the pipe tune for history class , " ' they 'll all sit down together at the table of brotherhood . That my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin , but by the content of their character . ' " Zane recited it real good , with lots of emotion , even though most of the emotion was sarcasm . <p> " You think Georgia 's all red ? " Tyque asked , really sounding like he wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Mayor 's man walked away . I got still , because I could feel him leave . A pipe tune played in my head , going after him . I 'd never heard the tune before , but it echoed lonelier than any Mr. Pietr had ever played . I looked at Zane and Tyque , but I do n't think they were paying attention to Mr. Curtis 's tune . <p> " Go talk at La Viuda , " Zane said . <p> More people were in Mama 's huddle now , and she was at the center of it all . She did n't need to say nothing much to be the center . Her every small comment was holy word-of-God . <p> " It 's a war , " the Save-Our-Cities lady explained . " Until we see it 's a war , there 'll be no mobilized effort . There 'll be no victories in our cities . " She was begging Mr. Pietr to believe her . <p> Mr. Pietr 's voice was smooth and soft . " Saving cities is too hard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at the floor when he talked . With old people , he was n't so forceful as when he was in our classroom . " It 's a lot easier to save individuals . " <p> " That 's where it stars ! " the Save-Our-Cities lady said , sounding like she and Mr. Pietr had just agreed on the most important thing ever . <p> Mama saw me standing there . " Ven aca , m'hijo . " <p> I waved her to me instead . They pared for her , and we stepped away . <p> " I 'm going out . " <p> The power of La Viuda faded away all at once . She had her back to the others , but I could see the weak woman under all the respect that they put on her . That they invested in her . My brother Luis was the first one to figure out how to make Mama weak , how to make the face of La Viuda disappear . He was good at it . After he took off from home  --  early last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off and leaving me behind without even telling me he was going to  --  I had to learn for myself how to weaken La Viuda . <p> I did n't know why Luis never told me he was taking off . I still do n't know why . Mama did n't argue . She never did anymore , not with me . " Cuidate , hijo . " <p> " Yuh , " I said . " I 'll be late . " <p> She took a moment to put a proper face back on . Behind me as I left , I heard her speak to the Save-Our-Cities lady . " You 're a very nice girl , " she said , and I knew at that second the lady was transformed into a Very Nice Girl , on La Viuda 's say-so . <p> Mr. Pietr just showed up one day . It was six months earlier , the middle of November . We were getting into the classroom on a Monday morning , waiting for our teacher , Miss Lincoln . In walked Mr. Pietr instead . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He dropped a stack of books on Miss Lincoln 's desk , and he stared at us for the longest time without saying a word . He was smiling . <p> " Miss Lincoln has taken a job with the public school district . I 'm your new teacher , Mr. Pietr . " <p> He started right in taking attendance , which was n't the right order . Prayers and the pledge of allegiance were supposed to come before attendance . Nobody corrected him , though . We 'd never seen any white teachers at Saint Malachy 's , and we 'd never had a man for a teacher . <p> When he called off my name for attendance , he said " Jose Hernez . " I just said , " Here , " and nothing else . <p> After attendance , he had us take out our Number Seven Readers for silent storytime . That was it  --  no rules for the classroom , no long talks on behavior , not even directions on what page we should turn to in the readers . I opened mine to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I started sounding out words . I never read as fast as everybody else in the class . Zane and Tyque could get through a whole story faster than I could read two pages . <p> That was the first time we heard one of his pipe tunes . While we read , he pulled out a long silver pipe and started playing on it . A few of us laughed  --  stupid white guy with a stupid pipe thing making a damn fool of himself . <p> But then the music started doing something in my head . Mr. Pietr stopped long enough to tell us , " Keep reading " and when I did , the words on the page looked different . Bigger . I could see them in whole chunks , and I did n't have to sound them out letter by letter . I read smooth and fast , past words like " Ferris wheel " and " interesting " and " entertainment , " without having to sound them out . <p> The pipe music did something else , too . It made my stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chocolate taste like a KitKat bar . While I read , I tasted it even more . I wanted to read , faster and faster , and I remembered everything I read . <p> That was the first tune , the Reading Song . We begged him to play songs for other things  --  spelling , math , vocabulary , history , religion . He did . We memorized all the songs . We hummed them to each other even after school was over for the day . <p> And we started getting A 's in all our classes . <p> I loved going out after the sun was down . I do n't think it was the way the streets looked at night ; it was how they smelled and how they felt and how they sounded  --  car horns far off , and , somewhere you could n't see , some guy screaming at his girl or a muffled crack that might have been a door breaking , might have been a gun . When night was hot , it sat in your ears and pressed on your brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the noise was always someplace else far off . The quiet gave night its edge . When you could n't see other people anywhere , it was scariest . That 's when it was best . <p> In the year before he left , my brother Luis sometimes let me go around with him and his friends at night . Luis was the first one ever to call me Joey instead of Jose , and I liked it so much that he made everybody else call me Joey , too , starting with his night friends . <p> There were other nights , though , that Luis would n't let me come out with them  --  the nights where they were doing something like drugs or shit , or nights they were gon na cause trouble over by Compton . Luis did n't want me there because he did n't want his little brother to get fucked up in any way . I never told him that his little brother did n't want him getting fucked up , neither . <p> I should have told him that . Now I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in the ghetto , " Tyque said , like nobody knew this . It meant more than that , of course . Tyque and his Mom came from New York , where Tyque said ghettos were built different . " This ghetto got lawns , " he 'd always say . I tried to picture a New York ghetto , imagining pretty much our streets except with yards all flat , hard dirt . It did n't seem much different . Just taller buildings , was all . <p> We walked the side streets , heading south toward the one-hundred numbers just to convince ourselves that we were bad , that we could beat . We talked a lot of shit in whispers , like wondering whether Jamal was really fucking Tashina , and whether Marialuz would ever do it with anybody . We walked the darker side of the streets ( " We bad ! " ) and jumped behind palm trunks or front-yard bushes whenever a car drove by ( " We so bad ! " ) . <p> About midnight , we were as far as 103rd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Boulevard . Tyque pointed down that way and laughed . " Are the three of you friends ? " he asked in a deep voice , and he laughed even more , like it was hilarious or something . Near a place called the Myers Furniture Shop , Zane waved us into an alley . A few feet in , we had to jump a couple rusted shopping carts that blocked the way . It got dark halfway down the alley , but cars passed the Alameda side , their lights reflecting off the barred windows of Myers and letting us see clear every now and then . The far side of the alley opened on a quieter street  --  maybe Tweedy , I did n't know , we 'd never come this far down . <p> " Tyque , " Zane said all quiet and intense . " I need you to hold for me . " <p> " Yeah , Zane , " Tyque said , and then he said , " Huh ? " <p> " To hold for me . Some stuff . " Zane held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as long as your middle finger . My stomach went twisted and I swore out loud . <p> " What that ? " Tyque stopped smiling for the first time that night . " What the hell , Zane , what you got ? Jesus , Zane , Jesus . " <p> " It 's my Dad 's . He 'll be tearing up the house finding it , so you got ta hold for me for a while . " <p> Nobody said nothing . Zane kept holding it out . Tyque jittered and jerked without a sound . Public school kids passed drugs . Saint Malachy 's kids never did , or , if they did , they were n't around Saint Malachy 's for long . Stupid Zane , Zane-Insane . <p> Drugs made people like my brother Luis run away , without ever saying goodbye to me or telling me where he was off to . <p> " Do n't do this shit , Zone . " Tyque stared at the bottle like it was gon na explode . " That 'll kill you dead , man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on TV and at school . " <p> " Shit , just like you , Tyque ! Ai n't it just like you to believe every word you ever hear said ! " Zone looked insulted , but his eyes were wide . " I ai n't gon na touch it , Tyque . Gon na sell it . " <p> " What for , man ? " I said , without letting my voice shake . <p> " For money , what the hell you think ? My Dad will strip me down looking , so Tyque got ta hold . " <p> Tyque looked scared as all shit . He reached forward a little , his hand completely still . <p> " It 's just till my Dad give up looking . " <p> Tyque took it . I did n't say nothing . <p> A bottle broke loud , down the alley toward the street I did n't know . The three of us scampered over the shopping carts and crouched . <p> Four black men ; two were in colors . They were shouting faster than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken bottle in his hand . The two without jackets backed into the alley toward us . We ducked lower . <p> " You ripped us , skin . You ripped us , so you fucking pay . " <p> " No money , blood ! I swear to God we pay tomorrow night ! You know we pay , we always pay ! " <p> " Yeah , you fucking pay whenever we move to cut your wasted asses . Tired of it , blood . " <p> There was the sound of another bottle breaking , and then scuffling , and smothered grunts , and endless swearing too fast to take in . <p> And then music . Pipe melody . The sound was almost like the heat , pressing in on my ears , but not quite forcing its way into my brain . It even smelled , like a burning cigarette with a little cinnamon toast behind it on the morning after . . . after something I could n't recognize . <p> I looked . His outline at the alley 's end was bright without lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were fifteen , sixteen colors wild , red , greens , yellows , blues , more , all glowing , and there was a scarf blowing from his neck without any wind to keep it whipping out that way . I swear to God , his eyes burned . They burned . <p> It was the ugliest music I 'd ever heard in my whole life . The four black men stopped fighting and stared at him . For a second , I thought , We 're gon na have to fight . We got ta save Mr. Pietr 's ass , crazy-mother white guy busting in like this . It was four against four if Mr. Pietr punched , too , but we were small . We were little . <p> All the broken bottles dropped . The four guys ' eyes went empty , staring nowhere . They grinned , all stupid . <p> We bad . <p> They shuffled toward Mr. Pietr ; the awful music was making them walk toward it , even though it was n't doing nothing to me . Funny , because I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I just heard the music ugly . <p> I saw Tyque climbing the shopping carts . Same dumb eyes , same maniac grin . <p> Zane grabbed him . " Mother , stay here ! " But Zane could n't hold on to him . Tyque hears it different , I thought . Jesus , Tyque hears it like they do . I jumped him hard and knocked him down . Zane hugged his waist , I held his shoulders . <p> Tyque stood up . We dangled from him . He walked after Mr. Pietr and the others . <p> " Hum ! " Zane screamed at me . " Hum the one where you do n't join in ! " We hummed , the pipe song for calm . I did n't hum too good , but Zane was better , louder . Tyque slowed and started looking confused . But he did n't stop . Zane was crying , something I 'd never seen , and he held Tyque for anything beating on him to stop him . Then Zane reached down into Tyque 's pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under our weight . <p> Drags , I thought . DrugSong drugs drugdrugdrug . . . We could still hear the pipe music , down the street somewhere . Zane 's face began to twist up screwy . I moved , I did n't even think . I kicked his arm , and the bottle flew out of his hand . It smashed on the brick alley wall of Myers Furniture Shop , left a white powder stain and a quick cloud . <p> Quiet , then , except for our breathing . Tyque smiled again , his real smile , not the crazy face . " Music , " he said . " Think the Vocabulary Song , you guys . " <p> Zane was still crying . " I 'm sorry , Tyque . I 'm so sorry , man . " <p> " Do it ! Think the Vocabulary Song . " Tyque never ordered us for nothing so we tried . We listened for the Vocabulary Song . <p> " Lots and lots of colors . The way Mr. Pietr looked . Colors everywhere . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Zane . <p> " Pied . " <p> Zane and I looked at each other . Pied was the right word . " Jesus , " Tyque said . " I would follow that music anywhere . " Zane scowled , but he nodded , real slow . <p> I am Joey Hernez , the son of the widow Rosario Santon de Hernez and of the dead Joaquin Hernez who got killed on Imperial Avenue in 1993 . My family is very large . We live in Los Angeles . In the house lives my mother and my three older sisters Maria , Carolina , and Rosalinda . My older brother Luis does not live in the house no more . He is gone a year now and he does not call . In the back yard we have three trailers where lives my uncle Jesus and his boy Paquito in one . They are waiting to make money so they can send for my aunt in Mexico and the smaller children . In the second trailer lives the family of my aunts people who are not our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been ten except that three died in crossing the desert to the north river in a van . The last trailer has my grandmother who does not talk English like me . She has the whole trailer herself and she is an ancient . She never talks to no one . She eats lonely . We are all Catholics and I go to Saint Malachys school for seventh grade . I use to go to public school but it is a bad thing there . My brother Luis went there , My sisters two of them go to Verbum Dei on a bus , which is another Catholic school but for high school . My other sister is embarrassed and stays home . I have black hair . Zane Gerard is my best friend and so is Tyque Raymond . I think being from Mexico is stupid . <p> " It 's a little short , " Mr. Pietr told me . " The essay was for three hundred words . " <p> I did n't say nothing . Everybody in the class was working in math groups , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stood up there at Mr. Pietr 's desk getting graded . I did n't look at him . I kept thinking he might turn all pied . <p> " Some other problems . You 've got to learn to paragraph , Jose .

" What 's wrong with this ? " <p> She never talks to no one . ' Nunca habla a nadie . ' ' Nunca habla con nadie ' ? " She never talks with nobody . " <p> He laughed at me . " It 's a double negative , Jose . You ca n't use ' never ' and ' no one ' in the same phrase . Did n't you think the Writing Song while you did this ? " <p> My face prickled up all hot . I had things wrong because I 'd thought the Mexican words when I was writing . And I wrote it without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music , ever since that night with the Drug Song . <p> Still , I was pretty sure Zane would say , " She never talks with no one , " or at least , " She do n't talk to nobody . " <p> " This part is n't clear , " Mr. Pietr said . " Why is your sister too embarrassed to go to school ? " <p> My head felt fuzzy . " You do n't go to school like that . All fat and with people talking . " <p> " Your sister 's fat , so she 's too embarrassed to go to school ? " <p> " No ! I . . . you know , it 's that she got embarrassed , then fat , see ? " <p> Mr. Pietr did n't see . I must have had the words wrong again . I could have thought the Vocabulary Song , but I did n't want to . " She 's embarrassed . Having a baby . " Embarazada . <p> I heard music for laughing . Laughing was n't a pipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could tell it was one of his songs , just the same , coming from him right now . It was playing in the back of my head , even though Mr. Pietr 's face did n't show nothing even like a smile . " Stop it , " I said . <p> He frowned . " Stop what ? " <p> " Laughing at me . Laughing at me because I 'm a stupid Mexican . " <p> His eyebrows scrunched up , and the tune I could hear in my head switched to another melody he 'd never played . It was a song for lining up thoughts when you 're confused . <p> " Why are you so angry , Jose ? " He really did n't know . He did n't understand . <p> " I wan na get the words right . Not just when I make your stupid essays , but when I talk , too . I wan na get them right , but without the fucking music ! " <p> The class got all quiet because of my yelling . Mr. Pietr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Do n't ever use that kind of language with me . " <p> The whisper did n't fool me . I could hear the music he wanted to play . It was very , very sad music , and had some pain , like I 'd just kicked him real hard . <p> Our house was filled with dolls . When Mama was a young woman . . . long before she was La Viuda , even before she was Mama . . . she worked in a factory that made dolls . She said the factory was right down in Watts , although I could n't think what use so many dolls could be in a neighborhood like ours . <p> Mr. Pietr was walking around our living room , studying the dolls while he waited for dinner . In the kitchen , Mama was frying tortillas while Carolina got the beans ready and Maria set the table . Rosalinda was hiding in her room . She did n't want Mr. Pietr , or anybody outside the family , to see that she was pregnant . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I looked it up myself . It was about two weeks since I did n't know it for my essay , which made two weeks since I 'd said a single word in class to Mr. Pietr , and which also made two weeks since I 'd gone out at night with Tyque and Zane . They were always whispering now , and when I walked up they would stop whispering . They would say the normal things to me , like , " Yuh , " and " We bad , but we ai n't blood , " but they were different , and getting a little more different every day . Zane smiled a lot more than he used to . Tyque did n't smile quite so much . <p> Mama took one tortilla out of the oil and put it in the warmer plate . She started patting out another one to cook . She was trying hard to ignore me . <p> " Why , Mama ? Why did you invite him to dinner ? I already got ta see him all day at school ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sizzled when she put in the next tortilla . Some of the oil splattered on my arm , little pinpricks on my skin , but I did n't move or show that I felt it . <p> " Well , why did n't you even tell me ? Why not , Mama ? " <p> She did n't answer . Tortilla after tortilla , she ignored me , and then kept right on ignoring me through cutting up vegetables for the colache and frying the chorizos in vinegar and brandy . She hummed to herself , but the tune she hummed was some mariachi song she liked . It did n't have any meaning or power . It was just an empty tune for shutting me out . <p> In school for the last two weeks , I 'd learned that I could shut out Mr. Pietr 's music . I made up my own tunes ; for Pietr 's math tune , I made up a song I called " No Math For Me . " For the Social Studies pipe melody , I thought up a tune I named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I Ai n't Nothing , So There . " And then I would study on my own . My test grades got a lot lower , but I was n't flunking . And they were my grades , mine . <p> " Why , Mama ? " <p> No answer . <p> " Mama , why ? " <p> She started cooking up more tortillas now , and began to stack them between the ones she 'd cooked twenty minutes ago . It was a trick of hers for big dinners . She 'd cook the first ones early , the first half of them , and then she 'd cook the rest right before serving and place them between the others : a cold , a hot , a cold , a hot , and so on until they were all done , and the hot ones would cool off onto the cold ones , leaving all of them warm for dinner . <p> I could n't figure why she was making so many until the doorbell rang and up showed Father Galloway , the Save-Our-Cities lady , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . La Viuda was throwing a whole damned party . <p> I just ate and did n't say nothing . Did n't say anything . My sisters did n't say anything either , so it was just the adults talking and being overly polite to one another , like there was more to be said than what fund drive the church was having , what social activism groups the Save-Our-Cities lady was involved in , what the next LA County initiatives might be , and what sort of stuff Mr. Pietr was teaching right now in the seventh grade . <p> It got funny , then . Talking about what Mr. Pietr was teaching made them all feel funny . I pretended to be busy pouring myself some more Pepsi , but I started trying to listen to their tunes , the background music that hung behind everybody there . I gave the tunes names as I listened to them . The Mayor 's man had a tune I called , " This Is Crazy , Why Did I Come Here ? " My sister Carolina 's was , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , What Should I Wear ? " Not very interesting music . Mama had a strange tune I could n't follow , but I could feel enough of it to call it " Oh , My Babies , My Poor Dolls . " <p> And Mr. Pietr 's was strongest of all . His tune was " Change The Subject . " <p> Mr. Pietr changed the subject . <p> " Speaking of school I got a very nice essay from Jose two weeks ago . It was all about his family . " <p> The bastard . He would n't let m e stay invisible . " Really , Jose ! " The Save-Our-Cities lady leaned forward at me , acting like she was all interested , but I could hear her tune switch from a song called " Can We Save The World ? " to a lush , perfumy melody I called , " Does Mr. Pietr Notice Me ? " <p> " Yuh , " I said . <p> " And what did you write about your family ? " <p> I could n't concentrate , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ louder in my head . What would Zane say right now ? Probably something like , " That bitch be hot ! " She was . She was hot for Mr. Pietr , and that threw me . I got all nervous and stared down at my plate . If I talked , I would have stuttered . <p> Mr. Pietr saved me from the stutter . " Jose 's essay was very nice . He wrote about La Viuda , and about his father and his grandmother , and a lot of his other relatives . " <p> Thank you , Mr. Pietr . Very much . For saving me . <p> " And what did you write ? " Mama asked . She said it all proper , using the voice of La Viuda . <p> " I wrote . . . " I said . " . . . I wrote that I think it 's stupid being Mexican ! I wrote that I wish I was n't Mexican ! " <p> All their musics quieted at once . Nobody knew what to feel . But then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you should be proud of being Mexican . You should celebrate your heritage , and everything connected with being Mexican . You come from such a rich culture , and let me tell you that there 's nothing special about being white . Most of the white people in this country have forgotten who they are and where they come from . They 're not anywhere n ear as close to who they real I y are as your people are . I do n't know why anyone would want to be white when they have the rich , beautiful culture that you have . " <p> She smiled real nice , every bit of her hoping that she had made an impression on Mr. Pietr . I called the song , " See Me ! See Me ! " <p> " Stupid bitch ! " I yelled . " I do n't want to be white ! I want to be black ! " Like Tyque . Like Zane . Even like Mr. Curtis the Mayor 's man , like everybody who I felt made sense , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady . " I wish I was born black ! " <p> I jumped up from the table . I spilled the Pepsi when I did . I ran away , out of the house , then down toward 80th and 73rd where Zane and Tyque 's houses were . <p> I did n't care what they were really all meeting at the house for . I did n't care . I just wanted to get away . <p> It took me a long time to find them . Zane 's More said that he was over at Tyque 's house , and Tyque 's More said he was over at Zane 's . I started running south  --  it seemed right , it felt right . South and more south , trying to feel the air for tunes that played like Tyque 's or Zane 's . Crazy , I thought . Crazy that I was depending more and more on the tunes and the notes and the melodies and the songs , just like him , just like what I did n't want to be , did n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Down near 101st , I found them running and hiding from tree to tree . I felt the air for songs and could tell that there was nothing scary nearby , but that did n't seem to matter to them . Most of the thrill was in pretending there was something scary everywhere , all the time . <p> " We bad ! " I hollered . " We bad , we beat , but we ai n't blood ! " <p> They turned , and Zane smiled at me , all big and crazy . Tyque smiled , too , and just as big , but , when you consider Tyque , it did n't seem as crazy . <p> " Hey ! " yelled Zane . " How you doing ? Come here , you jerk ! " <p> My heart felt light all at once . Tyque and Zane . I ran to them . <p> " About time you got here , " Zane said , punching my shoulder . " We been wondering where you been . Where you been , Joey ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been around . Why you pushing him ? He 's here now . You 're here now , Joey , ai n't you ? " He laughed , and he punched me , too . <p> Zane Gerard is my best friend and so is Tyque Raymond . I think being from Mexico is stupid . <p> " Well , then , let 's go ! " Zane yelled . " Joey gon na wan na see this ! " <p> " See what ? " I asked . <p> " Yeah ! " Tyque said . " Let 's go ! " <p> So we went . Really , they went and I followed , because they were n't going to tell me anything until we got there . That was how they were , Tyque and Zane . That was how they really were . <p> So we went south . More south than we 'd ever gone before , deep into the Watts area , down into the parts where you were n't supposed to go , where we were always warned not to go . Down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad tracks that had n't been used for years . The tracks sat there like a failed try at doing something worthwhile this far south . <p> " Just look at those , " Tyque said . I looked . They caused me to stop breathing for a second : three towers jutting out from the middle of the dead neighborhood , reaching almost a hundred feet up . We got closer , and I could see the garbage they were built out of : broken pottery decorated the walls and rungs , the bottoms of 7-Up bottles formed the archways that led into the areas around the towers ' bases , with Milk Of Magnesia bottles next to the 7-Up green with their crystal blue , and seashells , corn-cob imprints , tiles of all sons , teapot spouts , toys in the shapes of unicorns , horses , dolls , all of them blending together to form three garbage towers reaching high , high up . <p> " Wow , " I said . " How 'd you find these ? " <p> " We been following Mr. Pietr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is where he always goes ! " <p> " He stands here and plays almost all night , I think . " Zane was rocking on the heels of his sneakers . He twitched a little , smiling big . " It 's crazy . It 's like he 's in love with these towers . " <p> " Are they his ? " I asked . <p> " Nah , they been here for years . Think the History Song , it tells everything about them . " <p> I scowled . " Just tell me . " <p> Zane ran up to the arched gateway in the wall around the towers . Me and Tyque followed . " Look close , " Zane said as we stood there . " You might have to squint to see them . " <p> I did n't need to squint . The towers had their own music ; I just had to think clear about the tune , and then I was able to see them . There were about fifty or so people in there . . . ghost people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if I did n't let myself hear the tower music . <p> " See ' em ? " asked Tyque . <p> " Yeah , " I said . <p> " Yeah , " said Zane . <p> They wandered around in there , inside the gates . A lot of them were poking at the bases of the three towers . It was like they were searching for soft spots , and like they were looking around for anything rocks , stones , old Pepsi bottles , to make the garbage towers even bigger and stronger than they already were . They looked lost , although not afraid . <p> " See how many Grips there be in there ? " Zane asked . It was true . I could see nine members of the Grips Gang , still dressed in colors , wandering around but almost invisible like everyone else . Grips were a scary gang . I felt myself shiver even seeing them here , locked up safe . If I could only count nine , there were probably more Grips in there that I was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , " Tyque whispered . " Long time ago . He just started picking up garbage , cementing it all together , and stacking it up bit by bit . " <p> " And now Mr. Pietr is filling it up with people , " Zane said . He peered through the barred gates . " It 's like they 're in the zoo . " <p> " Yeah , " I said . " And the music holding them there , ai n't it terrible ? It hurts my head . " <p> Zane looked at me funny . " Music ? You hear music , Joey ? " <p> " I do n't hear nothing , " Tyque said . <p> And all at once , I understood what the big dinner at my house was really for . <p> I ran , north , and ran and ran towards home . <p> I ran in through our front door . They were all there : Mr. Curtis the Mayor 's man , sitting on our couch next to Father Galloway , wiping his forehead and looking dazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hand over her mouth ; Mr Pietr , the pipe in his hands . <p> And Mama , who was holding my brother Luis in her arms . Both of them were crying . " I 'm home , Mama , " Luis said between his sobs . " I 'm so sorry . But I 'm home , Mama . " <p> All of Luis 's friends were there , too . They were n't doing anything . They stood in a straight line , shoulder to shoulder , unmoving , eyes empty . Behind them were the walls of shelves holding Mama 's own unmoving , empty-eyed collection of dolls . <p> Mama released Luis and faced the Mayor 's man . " I told you he could . I told you so . " <p> " I never . . . " Mr. Curtis stammered . " I did n't even imagine he could . . . " <p> No one bothered to notice me . <p> " As for the rest of you , " Mr. Pietr said to Luis 's friends , " I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love your families . Be there for them . " <p> He started playing the pipe , and I shut out his tune by humming " I Ai n't Nobody , I Ai n't Nowhere , I Ai n't Nothing So There . " <p> Luis 's friends , one by one , walked past me , out the door . The Save-Our-Cities lady walked to Mr. Pietr and touched his arm . " With this . . . , she said . " With this . . . the wonderful good you can do ! , Her music , the tunes behind her , were a confused jumble of her Save-The-World and I-Want-You-Mister-Pietr songs . <p> The Mayor 's man stood , too . He was still shaking and wiping his head . " What do you want ? In exchange for your help ? " <p> Mr. Pietr shrugged , but he was smiling . " What do you offer ? " <p> Mr. Curtis stared at my brother Luis . " Anything , " he whispered . " We 'll pay anything ! " <p> Mr. Pietr 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms were still around Luis . " Mira  --  " she said , " Look . Your brother is home . " <p> I looked at him . " Luis , " I said . <p> " Hello , Jose , " said Luis . <p> Jose . <p> " No , Mama , " I said . I glanced at Mr. Pietr . " He ai n't home . " <p> The world of our neighborhood started becoming so nice after that . Nobody saw any more Crips in the streets , and other gangs around the Fifteenth District grew smaller and smaller . The exceptions were the gangs that figured Out something funny was happening . They either stayed low , broke up , or started working on community stuff like cleaning up the projects or helping the new youth groups that started appearing at schools and churches . A lot of people just disappeared . I heard the adults call them the " Ones Who Left Town . " <p> Mr. Pietr and his pipe walked the streets every night , and taught our class every day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Luis was a model son . I could n't remember my father too good , but Luis reminded me of my father . He took Mama to Mass every morning , worked a cashier job during the day , and helped around the house at night . Every Monday evening , he and Mama dusted La Viuda 's doll collection . Sometimes , some of Luis 's nighttime friends stopped by to help out with the dusting . <p> School ended , most everybody in my class got A 's or A-minuses . I got mostly C ' s , two D 's . And a B-plus in reading a B-plus . Summer gave Mr. Pietr more time to walk the streets and play his songs . When he was n't out doing that , he spent time with the Save-Our-Cities lady . They were engaged now , planning to get married in August . <p> I walked the streets alter midnight . I think I was the only one left who could , except for Mr. Pietr himself . I avoided him , although sometimes we would see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserted streets . He 'd stop playing and call out , " Jose ! Come here , Jose ! " I would run away . <p> He caught up with me just once . I was at the Watts Towers , staring in at the shadows of the " Ones Who Left Town . " There were hundreds of them now , maybe a thousand piled in there , twisting around on top of each other like they were still trying to move around , to find something to do . <p> " They 're not dead , you know . " <p> I jumped because of the voice . Which was stupid . It could only be one person . <p> " They might as well be , " I said . <p> Mr. Pietr nodded carefully , watching them . He did n't move toward me or even try to look at me , but I kept an eye on his pipe . He held it loosely , but I could n't be sure he would n't try to play something at me when I was n't ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " do you know why they 're so beautiful ? Do you know what they mean , Jose ? " <p> I did n't say anything . <p> " They 're garbage . Beautiful , beautiful garbage . And they mean something . Something about what you can do with people , even the ones you think are garbage . " <p> He stared at them , the Ones Who Left Town , so deeply that I had to look myself . But I could n't see it . I could see how beautiful the towers were , but I could n't see what was so beautiful about a pile of addicts and pushers and hookers and pimps all caught up by music that made them a stack of shadows and prisoners to the piper . I did n't feel sorry for them/I just could n't see what made them beautiful . <p> Luis could have been in there . If things had been different , it could have turned out a lot worse for him , I supposed . He could be buried there , somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other people-shadows that stretched upwards on the insides of the towers . But was it any different now ? He might as well be . He might as well be in there . <p> I tensed when the pipe music started , and I almost ran away . But the first few notes told me that the song was n't aimed at me , and that it could n't hurt me . It was about me , though , a song that had my name in the title . I looked at him , the piper all pied again , eyes burning and colors everywhere , but this time it was less violent , a lot quieter . It was a hard tune , one that I could n't understand all the way , and one I knew I could n't remember for myself after just hearing it once . It was a song that needed a lot of practice . <p> The colors got tighter around Mr. Pietr . They crushed on him and mashed him up , and for a while he was all blurry . The light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , when the music stopped , I was looking at somebody else . It was a small black boy . A boy my size , my height , shaped like me , and very , very definitely with my eyes . It was me I was looking except it was me as a black boy . <p> " You can be anything you want to be , Jose , " the little black me said . " And that 's rare . Not everybody can hope for that . Most people . . . "  --  he gestured toward the towers and the Ones Who Left Town  --  " . . . most people ca n't be what they want . They follow the paths and roads laid out for them from when they were born . From even before they were born . But every once in a while there is one born out of thousands who can become what he wants . And every generation , out of the ones born who can be what they want , there is one who is even more . The one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but understand it . And that 's you , Joey . It was me , too , but now it 's you . " <p> The night was cold . Or maybe I was shivering because I was listening to myself , myself the black boy , telling me about who and what I was . Telling me I could become anything I decided , except that I also had to be him because I could understand the music . <p> " This will be your pipe , soon , " he said . <p> " I do n't want it . " <p> He laughed short , a grunt really . He looked at the towers again . " It does n't matter . You know the power is n't in the pipe . It 's in the music . But you 'll want the pipe , anyway . It 's like a symbol of the office . We 've used it for centuries , every one of us since the maniac of Hamelin used it . It might go back even further . I do n't know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I do n't want the music , either ! Why do n't you take the goddamn thing and keep using it yourself ? Just leave me alone ! " <p> He looked at me then , burning and angry . It was like me , staring at my own dreams of myself , and myself staring back with a hate that I did n't expect . He lifted the pipe and threw it , hurled it away from himself and from me and from the tower . It looped through the air , but turned in a curve and looped right back toward him , landing smack against his chest , where he caught it . " Keep it ? " he screamed . " Keep it ? You think I have any choice but to keep it ? You stand there hating me , Jose Hernez , without even knowing who I am ! Without even knowing what I 've been through ! Do you think it 's easy trying to save the world ? Trying to save the mindless masses from themselves , only to discover that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not my fault you are who you are . Just as it 's not my fault that I 'm who I am ! We are pipers , Jose ! And now it 's your turn to carry the music . Ask me . Just please ask me , and the pipe will be yours . " <p> He held it out toward me . He was crying , fucking crying . " I can do anything with this pipe , Jose . Anything , except force you to take it away from me . " <p> I tried to glare at him . I imagined Zane 's best glare , and I tried to imitate it . He held the pipe closer . " You see , " he said , quieter , " I can stop doing this now , if you help . There are two criteria for handing over the pipe . Do you know what the word ' criteria ' means ? " <p> " It means ' rules , ' " I said , without having to think the Vocabulary Song to find out . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that I be willing to surrender the pipe to another piper who can understand the music . The second is that I stop trying to save everybody and focus on one person . One person that I love . And I 've found that , Jose . I love someone , now , even more than I love loving everyone . " <p> He started switching back now , done with being me and starting to be Mr. Pietr again . The colors swirled around him , and he grew taller , paler . <p> " The Save-Our-Cities lady , you mean ? " <p> He grimaced , looking confused at first , but then he smiled . " Susan . Yes , the Save-Our-Cities lady , Susan . I love her , Jose , and all that remains is for you to let me retire from all this and give you the pipe . " <p> Now I felt haunted . Even seeing him standing there as Mr. Pietr , tall and too thin and too white , I kept thinking of him as short and black and me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was saying . <p> " But the power is n't in the pipe , " I said . " It 's in the music . " <p> " Yes , " he said , sadder than anything I 'd ever heard him say . " Yes . But the office is in the pipe . The responsibility is in the pipe . And there 's more power there , too . More in the pipe than the music alone could ever have . " <p> Me , I thought . He was me , but looking like Tyque and Zane , and looking good that way , looking right . " Anything ? " I asked . " You can do anything with the pipe ? " <p> " Yes , " he said . " Almost anything . " <p> " Then keep it , " I said . And I ran . I ran into the night of Watts , away from him , from his towers , and away from anything and everything . <p> I stole fifty cents from La Viuda 's big wicker purse the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voice of Mr. Curtis the Mayor 's man , and I heard Mama saying he could have back the two quarters that were the government 's investment in her for the day . I 'm not stealing from her , I decided . I 'm borrowing from Mr. Curtis . <p> I went to the little store on the corner of East 83rd Street and Compton and bought a cheap kazoo . There was six cents in change , which I decided I should put back in La Viuda 's purse later . I ran from the store to Martin Luther King Jr . Hospital , nearly four miles . That was where Tyque , Zane , and a whole bunch of other kids from my class were working around the outside fences , clearing out papers and weeds and broken glass as part of the Saint Malachy 's Summer Youth Group 's project-of-the-week . <p> " Hey , Zane ! " I said , " Yuh , Zane ! " He looked up at me and grinned . He 'd been lifting the chain-link part of the fence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tyque was on the other side , picking up broken soda and beer bottles and putting them in a trash bucket . <p> " Yuh , Jose ! " Zane said . " You come to help ? This is a real pain in the butt , and we can use the help ! " <p> " In a minute ! " I said . " But listen to this  --  I just made up a new song of my own . Wan na hear ? " <p> " Sure , " said Zane . " Go ahead , sure ! " Tyque leaned up on the fence to listen , too . <p> I took out the kazoo and hummed through it one of the new songs I 'd been thinking up . It was called , " I Am Me , and Ai n't No Music Make Me Nothing Else . " It was n't a very good song since it was something I 'd made up real fast . Could have been better , I knew . But then any song could be better . <p> When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got real still , and their faces scrunched up like they were trying to decide something inside their heads . <p> I hummed and kazooed my breath out , looking them both in the eyes as much as I could . Zane broke first . <p> " What the luck , man ? " he said . He dropped the part of the chain-link fence he 'd been holding up . " What the fuck ? " <p> Tyque followed soon after that . " Hey , Joey , " he said , " what the hell 's happening to us ? " <p> " Nothing man , " I said . " It just stopped happening . " <p> They looked shook up , and were looking around like they were trying to figure out where they were . <p> " Keep thinking that song , " I said . " Keep humming it to yourselves . " <p> I had two and a half hours to wait until they were together . They 'd all be there again , La Viuda had said : Mr. Pietr , Father Galloway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our house for another meeting . I made Mama tell me by playing " Say Me Everything " on the kazoo , and then I played " Forget I Played Music " to her . <p> I spent the next two hours outside the gates of Saint Malachy 's watching some of the older black guys play basketball . To them , I knew , most music was nothing . I only heard one song behind them : " Got ta Beat , Got ta Beat , We Bad . " There was nothing wrong with that song . It was a good song in fact , one that they 'd picked for themselves , and although it was clouded with other minor harmonies  --  " Gon na Be Michael Jordan " or " Got ta Find Some Money " or " Should Be With the Woman "  --  they were real tunes , tunes they 'd picked for themselves and that were n't forced on them . I spent the whole two hours listening to the real songs that came from out of them , songs that did n't come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went home , with half an hour until the meeting . It was Monday night , and Luis was sitting in the front room , carefully dusting the dozens of dolls . <p> " Yuh Luis , " I said . <p> " Hey , Jose " He was working on one of Mama 's porcelain girl dolls in the fluffy white dress with lace all around the bottom edges . Even when he looked right at me talking Luis 's dust rag traced slow circles around the doll 's eyes . <p> " Luis , do you like me ? " <p> " Of course I like you , Jose . I love my family . " <p> He kept dusting . <p> " I like you , too . I really do . " I took out the kazoo . <p> Luis smiled . " What 's that ? Where 'd you get that , Jose ? " <p> But before I could play , the doorbell rang . Mama brought them into the living room , and Mr. Curtis was already yammering all excited . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angeles had been averaging four murders a day , a lot of them from this area  --  " <p> " I read the news article this morning . " Father Galloway looked relaxed . I think it was the first time I 'd ever seen him when he was n't nervous . " Perhaps it 's time to make some sort of statement . If the local press is starting to notice the drop in crime , it wo n't be long before the national media  --  " <p> " Who would believe us ? Do we even believe it ? " <p> Then in walked Mr. Pietr . Save-Our-Cities-Susan was with him , holding his arm and pressed up all close to his side . " No press , " Mr. Pietr said . " That was n't part of the bargain . " Then he looked at me . " Hello , Jose . " <p> It was funny how he was the only one who even noticed me anymore . Even Mama had n't said hello to me . <p> " Yuh , " I said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr. Pietr 's other arm , the one Susan was n't hanging on . " Imagine , though ! If we got national coverage , and we could broadcast your music coast to coast ! " <p> Mr. Pietr frowned deep . I could feel my own face doing the same thing the exact same expression . <p> All these people now , crowded in our front room . Mama started going around with coffee , and they were all trying to talk at once . The noise started hurting my head , and all their music playing behind them grew louder and louder . I got angry . Who did they think they were ? What gave them the right to take away other people 's lives ? Other people 's minds and hearts ? <p> Hidden in my palm , the kazoo was getting sweaty . I squeezed it hard . <p> " There 's an issue , " Mr. Pietr said . " Before you make any other plans , there 's an issue that needs to be resolved . Payment . " <p> Everybody got quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before you receive any more services . " <p> " Well , of course , " Mr. Curtis said . " I 'll have to talk to the council . In fact , if you could demonstrate for them the way you did for us , I know we can convince them to cut a check the same day . " He shuffled a bit , staring at the floor . " Of course , we did n't discuss amounts . . . " <p> " I do n't want money . I want property . " <p> Mr. Curtis eased a bit . " Property ? That would be fine , too  --  " <p> " The Watts Towers . I want them legally transferred to my name and Susan 's . " <p> Even Susan looked thrown by that one . She loosened up her arm-clenching a bit . " Honey , I do n't think  --  " <p> " We made a deal . An agreement , Mr. Curtis . As I recall , you offered me anything . Not a very responsible offer , I 'll admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've received . " <p> Mr. Curtis was shaking his head . " But they 're a national monument . National . They 're not ours to give ! Look , we can give you money and land , we can be extremely generous to you , but we ca n't give you what 's not ours . " <p> " Honey , " Susan said , " what do we want with  --  " <p> Mr. Pietr pulled his arm from hers , real gentle . " It 's what I 've chosen . They 're what I want , and you 'll give them to me . It was agreed . " <p> Mr. Curtis crossed his arms , but I knew he was seared . " Please . Please do n't push this way . We have no written contract that says you 'd be given the Watts Towers . " <p> " Contract ? " Mr. Pietr reached under his coat and pulled out the pipe . " We did n't seem to need a contract when we started all this . " <p> Beside me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s eyes ; he was looking at the pipe . Barely , just real , real quiet , I could hear a song coming from him . It was a struggling song . It was the real Luis , trying to find his way up again . Buried far , far under . But the longer he stared at the pipe , the weaker it got , until I could n't hear it any longer . <p> " I do n't care about a lot of things , " I whispered to Luis . " I guess I do n't care about anybody too much . But I care about you , Luis . It 's like that I love you , you know ? " <p> Luis looked at me funny . " I know that . I know that , Jose . " <p> " I really do . Please call me Joey . Just one time , call me Joey . " <p> " Sure . Why ? " <p> " Just do it . " <p> " Okay . Okay , Joey . " <p> I smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips . The song I played was " Come Home , Luis . " As I played , his face got confused and he stopped making the dusty circles on the porcelain doll 's face . " Joey ? " he said . <p> Everybody stared at us . Then Mama shouted , " No , hijo , no ! " <p> Mr. Pietr started playing the song he 'd first used on Luis , called " Be A Good Boy . " <p> I switched my tune to " Pietr Ca n't Breathe . " The pipe tune stopped , and Mr. Pietr 's eyes popped wide . When he finally managed a breath , he gasped , " Very good , Jose . " <p> " My name is Joey , mother fucker ! " I hit him with " Pietr Ca n't Stand . " He fell to the floor , but kept the pipe to his lips . He played , " Burn , Joey , Burn , " and I felt like I was frying from the insides out . I screamed . <p> And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his eyes all on fire , and a blowing scarf appearing out of nowhere , his hair being whipped by a wind I could n't feel . I tried to stop him , but the pain , the burning , I could hardly move . I could n't even hum . <p> Mr. Pietr began playing the first few notes of " Luis Hernez Is Mine Forever . " <p> " You 're hurting him ! " Luis yelled . And that quick , he was almost flying across the room , jumping right into Mr. Pietr and knocking him back against the wall . No one else moved ; Luis still held the china doll and pounded and pounded it against Mr. Pietr 's head until Pietr lost his colors and burning and glowing . <p> My burning stopped , too . <p> Mr. Pietr was almost unconscious , but it did n't look like Luis was gon na stop pounding . The Save-Our-Cities lady jumped on Luis 's back , not saying anything or screaming the way I had  --  just clawing at Luis 's face , trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was so fast that I did n't have time to stop him . He swung the china doll around and smashed it into the side of her head . The doll 's face shattered , but he kept swinging , cutting her up , cutting her bad , jamming the jagged edges into her face and neck . She still did n't scream . She just fell back onto the floor looking surprised , bloody and surprised . Her neck was bad , blood coming really fast . Her eyes stayed open . I listened for it , but her music was gone . <p> Mr. Curtis , Father Galloway , and Mama finally moved . I realized they 'd been frozen . That 's why they did n't do anything ; Mr. Pietr had froze them up solid so that he could fight my music . But now they could move , and Luis bolted up toward the front door . He stopped for just a second , just to look back at me . I think he wanted me to come . He wanted me to run with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere , blood all over him , all over the floor , all over the shattered china doll lying next to the Save-Our-Cities lady . " Run , Luis , " I said , but too quiet for anybody but me to hear . <p> Mr. Curtis tended to Mr. Pietr , who was starting to move again . Father Galloway leaned over the Save-Our-Cities lady 's body , whispering what I figured were prayers for the sacrament . And Mama sat quietly on the sofa , hands folded , head down . All the La Viuda mask was gone . She was just an old , beaten woman now . <p> I stepped past them , all of them . I stepped into the doorway and watched Luis running down East 83rd , west toward Florence . He got farther and farther away . <p> Inside , Mr. Pietr was crouching over Susan , holding her in his arms . " I loved her , " he said . I realized he was looking right at me . His voice sounded like an echo , far away . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . You took her away from me . You took away the only thing I loved . " <p> Down the road , Luis sprinted around a comer , down a side street , out of sight . <p> Father Galloway sat beside Mama and took her hand . " Viuda , we need to call the police . " Mama said nothing . She did n't even look at him . <p> Then I heard a tune growing , playing in the background behind Mr. Pietr . It was scratchy , strange , a deranged bunch of notes . " My towers , " he said . " I 'll bury her at my towers . You 'll take care of the paperwork , right ? I have to bury her at my towers . " <p> He lifted his pipe and started playing ; I raised the kazoo , but waited . As his tune started , the air around him and Susan 's body turned smoky . It was like a hole or something opened up right behind them , and I could see the base of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And at the base I saw some of the shadow people , the Ones Who Left Town , starting to grow more solid , so that I could n't see through them any longer . A couple of them had shovels and big steel picks , and were already breaking at the pavement to dig a grave . <p> Mr. Pietr picked up Susan . " You can send the deed to my new address , " he said , and then he , Susan , the hole , and the smoke were gone . <p> " Sweet Jesus , " said Father Galloway . " My sweet Jesus . " <p> Fifteen minutes later , it hit . Mr. Curtis and Father Galloway were still arguing about what to tell the police when they called , and Mama still had n't moved one bit . I stood over by the wall of dolls , actually thinking that I should maybe dust the ones that Luis had n't gotten to . That was all I was thinking . I could have been thinking a lot of things , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all knocked down . It was like a solid wall of sound tore right through the house , coming up from the south and keeping on going . South , where the Watts Towers were . <p> I stood up , but it was like standing in hot , muddy water . Nothing had fallen down except the people ; Mama was lying on her side , still on the sofa . <p> And then the yank . I felt the music , stronger than any music ever , pulling me toward the south . My feet started moving , but I grabbed one of the doll shelves . Everybody else started walking toward the door , even Mama . I tried to yell to them , but I could n't even hear my own voice . As they filed out , my sisters came from their rooms in the back . They left , too . <p> I made myself hum a wall of silence around me , but it was weak and I still could hardly move . I let myself walk to the door and threw up my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the street . . . everybody . Doors were open up and down East 83rd , and the whole neighborhood , old , young , babies in their mother 's arms , were walking across the street , through yards , all facing the direction of the Watts Towers . My Uncle Jesus and his boy Paquito were even carrying my grandmother between them . <p> I could n't make music for them to hear . I could n't stop them . I could n't do anything . <p> So I went north . Each step was like dragging myself through a hurricane that tried to pull me back toward the towers . Sometimes I even had to push my way through crowds of people walking against me . I crossed Florence , forced myself to Gage , rested for a bit at Sleuson , and then finally , when I reached the north side of Vernon , fell to the ground . I was out of it . <p> A Korean man stepped out of the small grocery store I 'd fallen down in front of . " Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boy , are you hurt ? " <p> I was breathing so hard that all I could say was , " Do n't ! " When he stepped over the curb I 'd fallen on , his eyes went all empty . He stopped looking at me and started walking south . <p> I felt a nudging on my foot . The edge of the wall was moving forward . It was slow , just a creeping up that you could hardly notice , but it was growing . <p> I crawled a little farther away from it , and when I 'd gotten my strength back , went three miles farther north . <p> The first tower went up a week later . It was Las Munecas , the one made out of dolls . <p> It took the National Guard about three units to figure out that anybody who went in was n't going to come out . <p> The Army did n't quite believe that . I think it took them about five units . <p> And six helicopters that flew too low . <p> And for seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , backing up a few feet every day as it continues to grow . They argue about estimates for how long it will take to reach downtown Los Angeles , and they argue about how many people are actually in there building those crazy towers . Other weird things happen , too . Every once in a while , whole busloads of people drive into town from Chicago , or Houston , even one from New York . And they smash through the barricades and drive right into the area . Some of the buses get stopped by the police or the Army , but the people in there ca n't be stopped unless they 're actually pinned to the ground by six or seven cops . Some of them stand up and keep walking anyway , dragging a few cops right inside . I read an article in the paper last week that said the police union was going to refuse to stop anybody else . <p> Me , I live in Highland Park now , way northeast of LA . I work in the library there , helping re-stack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day because I like to read . It used to be that I could n't read very well . Now I can . I taught myself . I did n't use any music to help . <p> I still hear him sometimes . And not just at night , either . He keeps calling , " Jose , come build our city . Come save our city , Jose . " Or sometimes he has a different message , like two years ago when his voice said , " Your Mama passed away this evening , Jose . Come to her funeral . We 're burying her beside Susan . " Or last year when he taunted , " Luis says he wants your help , Jose . He says , ' Tell Joey to come here . ' " <p> And one day I just might . But not to build their city of towers . Instead , to go back and get Luis out of there . And then to find Tyque . Then Zane , then my sisters , all one at a time . I have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong enough . There 's no way I could beat through the wall and save anyone but myself . But when my music is strong enough , I will . I 'll get them out , one by one . I 'll save individuals . <p> Because that 's how it needs to be done . Eso es .
