Not Melissa Hines . The UCLA behavioral scientist is hoping to solve one of life 's oldest riddles with a toybox full of police cars , Lincoln Logs and Barbie dolls . For the past two years , Hines and her colleagues have tried to determine the origins of gender differences by capturing on videotape the squeals of delight , furrows of concentration and myriad decisions that children from 2 1/2 to 8 make while playing . Although both sexes play with all the toys available in Hines ' laboratory , her work confirms what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncles and nursery- school teachers ) already know . As a group , the boys favor sports cars , fire trucks and Lincoln Logs , while the girls are drawn more often to dolls and kitchen toys . <P> But one batch of girls defies expectations and consistently prefers the boy toys . These youngsters have a rare genetic abnormality that caused them to produce elevated levels of testosterone , among other hormones , during their embryonic development . On average , they play with the same toys as the boys in the same ways and just as often . Could it be that the high levels of testosterone present in their bodies before birth have left a permanent imprint on their brains , affecting their later behavior ? Or did their parents , knowing of their disorder , somehow subtly influence their choices ? If the first explanation is true and biology determines the choice , Hines wonders , " Why would you evolve to want to play with a truck ? " <P> Not so long ago , any career-minded researcher would have hesitated to ask such questions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inborn differences in the behavior of men and women was distinctly unfashionable , even taboo . Men dominated fields like architecture and engineering , it was argued , because of social , not hormonal , pressures . Women did the vast majority of society 's child rearing because few other options were available to them . Once sexism was abolished , so the argument ran , the world would become a perfectly equitable , androgynous place , aside from a few anatomical details . <P> But biology has a funny way of confounding expectations . Rather than disappear , the evidence for innate sexual differences only began to mount . In medicine , researchers documented that heart disease strikes men at a younger age than it does women and that women have a more moderate physiological response to stress . Researchers found subtle neurological differences between the sexes both in the brain 's structure and in its functioning . In addition , another generation of parents discovered that , despite their best efforts to give baseballs to their daughters and sewing kits to their sons , girls still flocked to dollhouses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more important than nurture after all .
