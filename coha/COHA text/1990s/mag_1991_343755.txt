Power companies get to play the heavy in more than their share of environmental dramas . If they 're not damming scenic rivers or generating nuclear waste , they 're burning fossil fuels , contributing to acid rain , urban smog and the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere . In that regard , American utilities have a lot to answer for . The U.S. , with 5% of the world 's population , produces a quarter of the global output of carbon dioxide , the major greenhouse gas , of which fully one-third comes directly from the smokestacks of the companies that supply Americans with their heat and electric power . <P> Lately , however , a handful of utilities has begun to try a new role : as protectors , not despoilers , of the earth 's resources . Last week the environmental spotlight was on California , where two big Los Angeles power companies  --  Southern California Edison and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power  --  unveiled plans to cut their emissions of CO2 20% during the next 20 years , largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technologies . It was the first time any U.S. utility had promised to reduce its output of CO2 to help curb global warming . Southern California Edison chairman John Bryson says the policy " makes good scientific , environmental and business sense . " <P> But these were hardly the first power companies to go green . In January the largest U.S. utility , San Francisco-based Pacific Gas and Electric , announced a $2 billion plan by which it hopes to save 2,500 MW of electricity during the next decade  --  equivalent to the output of several new power plants  --  by encouraging customers to use energy more efficiently . New England Electric , which has one of the nation 's most ambitious conservation programs , sends bright yellow vans into neighborhoods in Massachusetts and Rhode Island , giving away efficient fluorescent lights and wrapping water heaters with heat- retaining blankets . Similar programs have been launched by Central Maine Power , Wisconsin Power &; Light and Puget Sound Power &; Light . <P> How can firms stay in business if they encourage customers to buy less ? The answer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Traditionally , the only way a power company increased profits was by selling more power . Under the new rules , utilities can make as much money from promoting conservation as they can from building new plants . In California , for example , utilities that cut costs by not having to generate as much electricity can pass 85% of the savings to their customers and keep 15% for their shareholders . Everyone wins . <P> Environmentalists applaud these new programs but complain that they are not broad enough . Most U.S. utilities have not yet seen the light , and manufacturers and motorists still do not have enough incentives to conserve fuel . What is needed , says Gus Speth , president of the World Resources Institute , is an initiative like the one adopted by the European Community , which calls for member countries to stabilize their CO2 emissions at 1990 levels . So far , the Bush Administration has refused to commit itself to any such goal . In fact , in the energy plan put forward by the White House in February , conservation was overshadowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
