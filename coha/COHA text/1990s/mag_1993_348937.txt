During the recent conservative era in America , circa 1980-1992 , liberals were often accused of hoping for things to go badly . There was some justice in this accusation . As conservatives are now discovering , the psychology of political opposition is complicated . Of course , for reasons both patriotic and selfish , you do n't want calamity to befall the United States of America . On the other hand , it is hard not to relish a certain gloomy anticipation of seeing your predictions of doom come true . And as a practical matter , bad times are the + usual way the out-of-power side gets back in . <P> But the psychology of political ascendance turns out to be complicated as well . Liberals these days are called upon to perform the novel , and surprisingly arduous , exercise of hoping for a President to succeed . Some are n't up to it . American liberals have basically been in opposition mode since around 1966 , halfway through L.B.J. 's second term ( except perhaps for a week or two in 1977 at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that period covers their entire politically aware lives . Many are too young to have experienced firsthand the euphoria of J.F.K. 's Camelot , but are now too old and world-weary to join the twentysomethings who swoon unselfconsciously without shame for Bill Clinton . <P> These pathetic souls have wandered for years in the political desert . Now they stand outside the promised land  --  a Place Called Hope  --  yet they can not enter . What blocks their way ? Four things . <P> First , knee-jerk iconoclasm . The habit of a lifetime is hard to break . The very phrase " the President 's economic plan " starts the facial nerves twitching into the formation of a cynical sneer . As proposals for reform of everything under the sun come cascading out of the Administration , the first instinct is to assume there is something wrong with each of them . <P> Second , there is the phenomenon known as " the narcissism of small differences . " Liberals and left-wingers are enthusiastic sectarians . Some are ready to denounce Clinton for not being a " real Democrat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Others are equally quick to denounce him for not being a " new Democrat " whenever he holds firm to some traditional liberal principle they would rather see abandoned . <P> We all have our political hobbyhorses . One of mine , for example , has been tax reform : eliminate loopholes and lower the rates . Clinton 's tax plan undoes much of tax reform . It not only raises rates but also reintroduces a variety of ( in my view ) stupid tax breaks for this or that business activity . But I ask myself , Is tax reform more important than curbing the deficit and reinvigorating the government ? I swallow hard and say no . <P> A third guardian at the gates of hope is a fear of seeming boosterish . Naked sincerity and enthusiasm can be embarrassing . One must protect one 's reputation for skepticism . One does n't want to be thought of as a cadre or a Moonie , like those absurd Reaganites of the early- to mid-1980s . Nor does one want to be associated with the real Clintonite swooners , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
