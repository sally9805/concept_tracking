<p> THEN the shouting and voting was over in Serbia 's parliament last week , few could claim credit for defusing Yugoslavia 's worst constitutional crisis since World War II . <p> The Balkan federation was plunged into political chaos by Serbia 's leadership after five days of student-led anticommunist street demonstrations in Belgrade , the federal and Serbian capital . <p> It was the latest round of unrest , which began last year after the once all-powerful federal communist party fell apart . <p> Furious over the street protests , which began March 9 , and over relentless bickering with the independence-minded noncommunist republics of Slovenia and Croatia , Serbian Communist leader Slobodan Milosevic appealed to Yugoslavia 's collective federal presidency to authorize the Army to impose a state of emergency . <p> When the eight-member body refused , he countered by declaring that Serbia no longer recognized the authority of the federal presidency . Milosevic claims that an " anti-Serb coalition is trying to destroy Yugoslavia . " <p> What followed was a campaign to impair the presidency 's ability to govern and to compel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to declare a state of emergency , Borisav Jovic , Serbia 's representative on the panel , resigned . Resignations by other Milosevic allies from communist-ruled Montenegro and Serbia 's Vojvodina province quickly followed . <p> The presidency is made up of representatives from Yugoslavia 's six republics and two provinces and is technically commander-in-chief of the armed forces . <p> In a move designed to end the power of the presidency , the Serbian parliament voted to recall the representative from Kosovo province , which Serbia controls , for alleged " anti-Serbian activities . " That left the presidency without a quorum . <p> Militias and police reserves were mobilized . Ethnic Serbs in Croatia declared independence from Zagreb . Milosevic vowed to arm ethnic Serbs in Croatia if they were attacked by Croats . Road blocks went up . Troop movements around the country sparked rumors of an imminent Army takeover . Milosevic criticized Critics charge that the autocratic Milosevic engineered the political crisis to protect his influence in Yugoslavia and to keep power in Serbia , the nation 's largest republic . <p> Says Vesna Pesic , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to provoke Croatian authorities at all costs to trigger war or emergency measures . " <p> Milosevic , the only communist in Eastern Europe to be elected in multiparty elections last year , wants to retain strong centralized rule in Yugoslavia . Slovenia and Croatia , the nation 's most prosperous republics , favor a loose confederation of autonomous states . They have vowed to secede if no agreement is reached . <p> The national Army , led by Serbian and communist officers , has generally supported Milosevic . <p> But Milosevic 's apparent assumption that the Army would intervene once the presidency was hobbled backfired . Tanks and military units , which were deployed in Belgrade for one day to quell the student protests , remained in their barracks . <p> A nationwide Army crackdown and martial law would have certainly provoked armed resistance , especially in Croatia , which has a large ethnic Serb minority . Fighting there would have quickly triggered an anti-Croat backlash in Serbia . Critics say Milosevic hoped such a scenario would boost his flagging populist appeal , much like his tough Serb nationalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Milosevic 's alliance with the Army proved weaker than he thought , " says a Belgrade-based Western diplomat . " The Army was supposed to intervene , but the plan failed . Something obviously went wrong . " <p> Military seen split Political observers believe the military command is deeply split over whether to intervene . In a rare statement , the military last week said it would not interfere with political talks aimed at resolving the nation 's future , but added it would " under no circumstances allow armed inter-ethnic conflicts or civil war . " <p> The military statement also said it would tolerate no border changes without prior agreements . Although it did not rule out force under certain circumstances , the Army made it clear it would not move now , despite pressuring by Milosevic and other hard-liners . <p> Forces oppose martial law Opposition leaders say Air Force and Navy leaders oppose martial law and that the Army command is also split . In addition , there are fears that the Army , whose conscripts come from all over the country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long-term state of emergency . <p> Western diplomatic sources in Belgrade and opposition leaders say that when Milosevic realized that he had miscalculated the military response , he was forced to quickly repair some of the political damage he had ordered done to the presidency just days before . <p> Serbia 's parliament took charge . With 194 of the 250 seats held by Milosevic 's renamed Socialist Party , the outcome was predictable . The chamber , in a dizzying about-face , voted to refuse Jovic 's resignation , thus unfettering the presidency . <p> The next day , at a meeting of the presidency attended by republic and provincial leaders , enough common ground was found to agree to a series of crisis summits . First-round talks are scheduled to begin Thursday . <p> Although smoldering hatreds , brinkmanship , and violence have often marred inter-republic relations in the past , many now believe there is a new urgency to the the talks ; that the country 's narrow brush with disaster last week has changed the stakes . <p> " Yugoslavia as we knew her is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the collective presidency . <p> " This country certainly can not be held together by a mutual love between its various republics , " he says . " The only unifying factors left are purely economic and matters of self-interest . " <p> Still , many opposition leaders say real progress probably wo n't come until Milosevic is forced to back down or resigns . <p> Many Serbs also say the economy could collapse if prosperous Slovenia and Croatia are allowed to secede . <p> His opponents are not confident of a quick downfall . <p> " Milosevic thrives on chaos and conflict , " says Serbia 's nationalist opposition leader Vuk Draskovic . " And he has a lot to lose . "
