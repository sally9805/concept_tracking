In the aftermath of sexual assault . one woman finds the world an unsafe place and peace of mind just beyond reach // Rape divided my life into before and after . Little more than two years ago , I felt perfectly safe coming home to a dark , empty house , bounding up the stairs and stretching out on my bed . My home was my sanctuary . Then , on March 9,1994 , an intruder burst into my bedroom and violated my body and my mind . So on a recent evening when I arrived home alone , I warily took the stairs one at a time pausing after each to look over my shoulder . I wanted to take a shower , but ruled it out because with the water running I would n't be able to hear the burglar alarm . To pass the time , I flipped through a magazine absentmindedly , dreading the coming darkness and listening for every rattle , car engine and footstep until my sister came home . That was a good day . It is frustrating to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier than the one before , I know I 'll always be afraid . It strikes when I least expect it , making it hard to do normal things like return a video , stop to get gas at night or park in a garage . And yet I 'm realistic . I know it can happen to you or even to me again . There are nearly 1,900 rapes every day , according to the National Victim Center in Arlington , Virginia . I 'm not the first and I wo n't be the last . I tell people about this fact-often through the Sexual Assault Response and Awareness Program ( SARA ) , where I 'm a volunteer in northern Virginiabecause it helps in my recovery . That 's why I want to share my story here . The day leading up to the rape was unremarkable . I came home from work around seven in the evening and plopped down on the couch . I spent the evening talking on the telephone and watching TV . When my cousin , who was then my sole roommate , arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour or so and then both decided to call it a night . There was nothing unusual about that , either , but I did notice my mood shift , and I sighed heavily . " What 's wrong " my cousin asked . " I do n't know , " I told him . " I guess I 'm just going to be depressed tonight . " I did n't drift off to sleep until after midnight , expecting to awaken when my alarm went off at 6:30 in the morning . But it did n't happen that way . Around 2:30 I heard my bedroom door fly open . Groggy with sleep , I thought I was dreaming as I looked over my shoulder and saw a black , faceless shadow leap onto my bed . In a split second this creature was on my back . I tried to yell " No ! " but before I could utter a word or even focus , he shoved a rag into my mouth and wrapped tape around my eyes and my wrists , binding them . I felt completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And because I could n't move my arms , I could n't fight for my life . I tried to murmur that someone else was in the house , but that only angered him . At various points , he threatened me by pressing a knife to my throat or rubbing a baseball bat against my temples . It was my worst nightmare come true . The floorboards creaked beneath his feet as he rummaged through my chest of drawers . Then I heard sounds of him stepping into the bathroom , followed by the distinctive pop of a Vaseline jar opening . That 's when I knew what was about to happen . Coming back , the intruder worked silently , taping over the rag that was already in my mouth . I remember biting down so I would n't swallow it . Then he pulled off my pajama bottoms , flipped me onto my stomach and began to rub the Vaseline all over my buttocks . His zipper made a gritty , grinding sound that seemed to be amplified a thousand times . He sodomized me for what seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horror , I found the strength to somehow detach myself from what was happening . I knew he was thrusting only because I felt the bed moving . Throughout the attack , I asked God one question over and over again : " Is it my time to go ? " Finally I sensed that the answer was no , this was not my time to go . And that made me able to take what the rapist dished out . At one point he even tried to push the bat into me . After he finished , he went back into the bathroom . When he returned he tied my feet together and put me back under the covers as if he did n't want to hurt me . ( It was then that he probably put his knife down , which the police found and later used to help identify him . ) Placing my head on the pillow , he reached down and pulled the covers up to my neck . Then , as if he had changed his mind , he circled back in a rage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw me into the bathroom . My head hit the toilet , and I acted as if I were out cold . He locked the door and was gone . I managed to peel the tape off , running in my pajama top down the fire escape just off from my room to a nearby convenience store . ( I did n't run to my cousin 's room because it 's across the hall from mine , and I worried that the attacker might still be in the house . ) At the store I called the police , and they came and took me to the hospital for the routine Police Evidence Recovery Kit ( PERK ) exam , which is ten times worse than any gynecological test . It involves combing pubic hairs as well as examining your entire body for evidence . Being poked and prodded is highly uncomfortable , especially after such an ordeal , but critical for the police investigation . After only a couple of weeks the investigator linked my rape to one of a similar nature in a nearby town . I was aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my best friend 's boyfriend . The boyfriend was the common denominator . He was the one . At first I thought he was incapable of such a crime . However , the evidence alone convinced me : He had also attempted to break in next door , and his fingerprints appeared on the neighbor 's balcony . Police also positively identified his army knife ( he was in the reserves ) and a host of other elements too coincidental to be a fluke . Coming to grips with the fact that someone I knew had done this to me while subsequently losing my best friend-she tried to remain neutral , which I could n't handle-has been harder to deal with than the actual crime . And the fallout continued : I cried every morning . I suffered from rape-trauma syndrome and had to take time off from work . I began losing my hair from the stress . My boyfriend and I quarreled because I made unreasonable demands for him to be there , even though he lived in another state . We broke up for a while , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sense of loss . I faced the prospect of losing my life as well , as I took the first in a series of HIV tests . I felt tremendous relief when the first one came back negative . Then I took another in four months and another two months later . All were negative , which was a gift from God . But even now I feel I should get another test , and I still live in terror that it will turn out positive . The most comforting outcome of this whole ordeal is that now , two years later , the man who raped me is in prison . After many continuances in court , I was spared the trauma of a trial because he pled guilty to both rapes . He was sentenced to 30 years for my case plus 36 years for the first one , and is eligible for parole in 2005-only nine years from now . Today I 'm carving out a fragile sense of freedom and finding my niche as a 28-year-old African-American woman in the postcollege world . I am also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me as being Black or female or a New Jersey native . Knowing that I made it through a life-or-death situation relying solely on my survival instincts has increased my sense of inner power . I do n't give myself all the credit for my recovery , however . Support from family , friends and coworkers pushed me back to strength , as did the SARA program . One of its volunteers met me at the hospital and quickly became my best friend during those frightening first hours and later at the police station . The program guided me as I navigated the maze that is the court system , keeping me informed and actively involved throughout the process . Volunteers also provided me with free weekly counseling , which helped me to sort out what I was feeling and to make my own decisions on how to move forward . They helped me see that I could take control of my life . Going through the training to become a SARA volunteer also helped . People were astonished when I introduced myself at a meeting only seven months after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means I can handle adversity . It also means being pragmatic ; now I know violence can strike at any time . I compare it to walking on a floor you 've walked on a thousand times . Then one day you 're walking across and it caves in and you fall through . You do n't stop walking , but now you walk a little more cautiously , knowing you could fall through again . Recently I summoned the courage to spend an entire night alone in a different house , the one my cousin , sister and I moved to . Just the idea of being home overnight by myself had frightened me for the longest time . But that night it was only me . The next morning I awoke with a great sense of accomplishment . Another small hurdle . Another good day . Author Affiliation Marcia Caster is a freelance writer and co-owner of an image-consulting company in northern Virginia . // <p>
