<p> If there 's a living soul who embodies the city of Jerusalem , it 's Teddy Kollek . This is a lament for the city , and for him , because he has made his life 's work trying to revive it , beautify it and bring it harmony . <p> But it has wrenched itself apart in fear , hatred and violence . Not that Teddy weeps ; it is n't his way . He still storms around , tongue-lashing the arrogant and the fanatic , crowing delight at the greenery , the great art and music brought to give warmth to the old stones and the hopes they symbolize . <p> Teddy  --  everyone calls him that  --  has been Mayor since 1965 . When he was first elected , there was a high tin wall next to his office in the Municipal Building , a shield to protect people in the streets from snipers on the Old City walls nearby . <p> After the 1967 war , all the physical barriers were torn down . Teddy plunged into ceaseless activity to unite the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask  --  at least in mutual acceptance and neighborliness . <p> For a long time , Jerusalem was a virtual island of calm as waves of bloody anger rose around it . That was not by happenstance . Teddy , who is known for falling asleep on public occasions , habitually spent only three or four hours a night in bed so he could look after the hospitals and schools and parks he was building , visit all kinds of people , deliver his message of good will and try to make amends for provocation . <p> It was n't surprising that when the Government of Israel refused to receive a United Nations delegation after the recent killings on the Temple Mount , Teddy 's was the one voice saying he would be glad to see anyone who wanted to talk to him . His is a voice of reason . " The world is a better place when moderates run it , " he has said . <p> He was born in Vienna in 1911 and joined a Zionist youth group as a teen-ager . He undertook clandestine missions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Palestine in 1935 as a pioneer . As an aide to David Ben-Gurion , who became Israel 's first Prime Minister when the state was founded in 1948 , he was closely involved in the dreams and pains of its creation . <p> He never did well in national politics . He is too blunt , too demanding and straightforward , too attentive to the details of everyday human troubles to get on with the party apparatus , as Israel 's unwieldy system requires for advancement . But the same qualities brought him such personal admiration and affection that he has always been re-elected Mayor . <p> It was not without constant quarrels . Nationalists say he does too much for Arabs . He bemoans constraints on attending to their needs as fellow citizens . Worried about youth gangs , he multiplied diversions  --  festivals , sports to keep young people busy . But when he wanted to build a municipal swimming pool , he was called " too Hellenistic . " <p> Still , it worked for a time . As late as last year , only one Palestinian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied territories , and the police had never fired live ammunition at rioters . Now the toll is mounting . <p> The ranks of die-hard fundamentalists are growing on both sides . Meron Benvenisti , his former Deputy Mayor who parted ways with his boss years ago over Teddy 's insistence on looking at the bright side , has called him " a hero in a tragedy . " <p> But he also pointed out , " Jerusalem is n't a piece of real estate , it 's a symbol for both sides , and symbols are indivisible and exclusive . The Palestinians are n't looking for good government , they 're after a political identity , self-esteem , their own flag . If you think they 'll settle for better sewers and roads , you 're mad . " <p> Teddy refuses to despair . Undermined , saddened , he seeks reason for consolation . From the telephone in his car as he raced about , he told me : " It 's been a bad few weeks . But fewer people have been killed in Jerusalem than in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dinkins is talking about a curfew to control crime . Of course it 's different ; here it 's nationalism and there it 's crime . " <p> He 's still finding practical ways to improve the city 's life on both sides of the emotional divide . There 's no question , he said , of a big new settlement for Soviet immigrants in East Jerusalem , as the Israeli Government suggested . He 's planning 7,000 new apartments for Arab housing . <p> " We 're all in a bad mood now . But we all know there 's no choice , we 'll be together forever . Wait a few weeks until it simmers down , before we can talk and make sense . " <p> But it is n't going that way . Teddy will be 80 in May . " It 's a different generation , they are n't heard , " another Israeli commented . Not only the story of Teddy 's life will seem vain if another generation fails to join his endless work for a Jerusalem at peace .
