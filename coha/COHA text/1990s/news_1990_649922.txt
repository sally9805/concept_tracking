<p> Last month the Japanese Justice Minister , Seiroku Kajiyama , said that prostitutes in a neighborhood " ruin the atmosphere , " just as , in his view , blacks ruin white neighborhoods in the United States . American officials reacted with predictable , but largely misplaced , rebukes . <p> In denouncing Japanese " racism , " Americans assume that Japan 's mental map of the races must resemble ours , with the great divide running between blacks and whites . In fact , Japan has a map of its own , on which the distance from white to black is smaller than in America - and the distance from either of them to the Japanese is immense . <p> Meanwhile , a more significant racial drama is under way in Japan , one that reveals much more about the Japanese concept of racial difference and of blunt speech . Its unlikely protagonists are the " Burakumin Liberation League " and a Dutch resident of Japan . <p> The burakumin constitute Japan 's major " racial " problem , even though they are racially identical to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century they were legally inferior to other citizens , like slaves in the American South . They lived in ghettos , whose location was deliberately omitted from maps ; they wore distinctive clothing to show their lowly rank ; they were allowed to marry only among themselves . Their untouchable status apparently originated , centuries earlier , in " unclean " jobs , from handling leather to burying the dead . <p> At about the time American slaves were emancipated , so were the burakumin . Legal distinctions between them and other Japanese came to an end ; contemptuous terms like " eta , " or " much filth , " were succeeded by " hamlet people , " the current burakumin . But in practice the burakumin have remained a " race " apart , separated from other Japanese more thoroughly ( if invisibly ) than American blacks from whites . <p> Japan 's elaborate system of " family registers " - a permanent , official record of each person 's ancestry - makes it almost impossible for a burakumin to conceal his origins , and therefore to work for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many of Japan 's three million or so burakumin have ended up as day laborers ; some have joined the criminal " yakuza " gangs that , unlike big companies , offer them equal opportunity . Hiromasu Ezoe , a scandal-ridden tycoon comparable to Michael Milken , is rumored to be a burakumin . And a small , committed minority has formed the " Burakumin Liberation League . " <p> In the fashion of the Black Panthers of the 1960 's , the league combines a leftist ideology of repression with tough operating techniques . One of the league 's main grievances concerns " incorrect " descriptions of the burakumin plight that do n't fit its recondite political view . To enforce its complaints it turns not to the courts but to " direct action " campaigns of thoroughgoing harassment . <p> The result has been a bizarre but extremely powerful taboo observed by Japanese book , magazine and newspaper publishers . Because they do n't want activists with loudspeakers milling in their offices or standing outside their homes all night or yelling at them in Red Guard-like " denunciation sessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Japanese press . <p> Foreign writers have seen paragraphs and pages on the subject simply disappear from their works when they are translated into Japanese . In Western terms , it is as if the Black Panthers had persuaded publishers never to mention American blacks . <p> Into this muffled climate stormed Karel van Wolferen , a Dutch writer who has lived in Japan for two decades . He touched on burakumin and the league in less than 10 pages of his book , " The Enigma of Japanese Power . " The other 500-odd pages analyzed Japanese politics in a way that angered many Japanese but weirdly fascinated the nation . <p> The book , which was written in English , has been discussed in the newspapers almost daily for the past year , but not until last month was a translation available in Japanese . <p> It was not available for long . Four days after publication , the league representatives told Hayakawa Publishing that the book was insulting , and demanded that the 50,000 copies be removed from sale . <p> The publisher , seeing visions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initially complied . ( Much of the Japanese bureaucracy , which Mr. van Wolferen fiercely criticizes , undoubtedly rejoiced at this result , but there is no evidence that officialdom was behind the league 's protest . ) But then the publisher had a change of heart . <p> The central subject of Mr. van Wolferen 's book was the impossibility of real political debate in Japan . Someone at Hayakawa apparently realized that Mr. van Wolferen 's predicament vividly illustrated his controversial point . The publishers have begun sending books back to major stores . . . watching for international support in case the " direct action " squads show up on their steps . <p> Foreigners might as well forget about the gaffes of politicians like Minister Kijiyama ; Japanese officials will soon learn to bite their tongues . It 's more exciting , and constructive , to watch Japanese who dare break their own taboos .
