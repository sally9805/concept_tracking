Here 's our critics ' wish list BOOKS <p> For the past two years a learned ophthalmologist has argued with a writer : can angels speak ? He , the man of science , explains that in no picture of an angel can we see a larynx . The writer , a man of faith , argues that at this time of year angels sang one of Handel 's greatest choruses to shepherds in a field by night . Malcolm Godwin 's Angels : An Endangered Species ( Simon &; Schuster. $19.95 ) is an exceptionally attractive volume that shows angels in all their hierarchies and manifestations : guardian angels , fallen angels , angels in the guise of flying saucers  --  even angels with larynxes . A poll taken 12 years ago showed that more than half of Americans believe in angels ; for the rest , the metaphor is irresistible . <p> O , wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wondeful O ( Fine. $10.95 ) and The 13 Clocks ( $13.95 ) , long out of print , are back  --  rich with ogres and oligarchs , riddles and wit . What distinguishes them is not just quixotic imagination but Thurber 's inimitable delight in language . The stories beg to be read aloud : " The brambles and the thorns grew thick and thicker in a ticking thicket of bickering crickets . Farther along and stronger , bonged the gongs of a throng of frogs , green and vivid on their lily pads . " Thurber captivates the ear and captures the heart . <p> Back in the ' 30s the artist Joseph Solman discovered Mozart  --  first a piano concerto , later the operas . For years he listened toMozart as he painted , and finally he began to sketch portaits of the composer he calls " my idol . " Mozartiana ( Vintage . $16.95 ) is the little album he has assembled in praise of Mozart . Quotes from dozens of people including Kierkegaard , Bill Bradley and Beverly Sills are combined with Solman 's own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures that sing . <p> Rolling it up to cram it in a stocking wo n't hurt Yearbook ( Doubleday . $9.95 ) . This collection of more than 400 high-school graduation photos of various celebs is the best of its kind , with a nicely tawdry look . Intriguing info : J. D. Salinger was literary ' editor of " Crossed Sabres " at military school ; " God 's Little Graduate " Jim Bakker looked sleazy even in 1959 . Spilled secrets : Ted Koppel 's nickname ( " Dumbo " ) and Pat Sajak 's favorite subject ( geometry ) . Most on-target quote : Ollie North 's . " I am not only witty in myself but the cause that wit is in other men . " <p> Have yourself a gory little Christmas with Hollywood Gothic ( Norton . $39.95 ) , the ultimate book on Dracula . Vampire maven David Skal shakes clouds of bats out of the belfry . Pivotal is Bram Stoker , the Victorian hack writer , who tapped into the primal fears and fantasies of millions with his 1897 novel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play and film , but many connected with it came to grief . Stoker was syphilitic , the film 's director , Tod Browning , was an alcoholic , as was the leading lady , Helen Chandler . F. W. Murnau , director of " Nos-feratu , " the German " Dracula , " died in a car crash . Saddest of all was Bela Lugosi , who slurped his way to stardom in the stage and screen versions and was forever mired in the undead count 's shadow . Lugosi wound up as a self-committed drug addict and when he died was buried in full Dracula regalia . Sic Transylvania gloria . <p> Alas , the day is probably past for an Omelette a la Royale  --  cockscombs , kidneys , truffles and cream . But it 's never too late to read Narcissa Chamberlain 's The Omelette Book ( Godine. $1195 ) , first published in 1955 and now reissued , with the original drawings by Hilary Knight . There are sea-food , vegetable , even dessert omelettes in this smart little book , and good advice too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually sufficient to blend four to six eggs , " writes Chamberlain . " More than this tends to take all the joy out of them . " <p> You ca n't afford a Juilliard education and Leonard old TV programs are n't available on video . So cough up $14.95 for Leetlesery of Music ( Anchor paperback ) , a hilarious , opinionated and indispensable A-to-Z reference book by 96-year-old Nicolas Slonimsky . The offbeat discourse on B-flat major reveals it as the key in which " most machines of modern industry  --  such as electric motors , fans , and washing machines  --  buzz , whir , and hum . " You 'll pick up a lot on coincidence and platiarism long before you get to the " Yes , We Have No Bananas " entry : " Humorless musicologists point out that the first four notes are identical with the opening of the Hallelujah Chorus from Handel 's Messiah . So what else is new ? " FUN &; GAMES <p> When all the presents are opened and you 're stuffed with plum pudding , settle down with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $14.95 ) , a book of 20 mind-bending puzzles . Do n't let the corny pictures and titles ( " Jumping Jim , " " Itsy Bitsy Spider " ) fool you : this is hot kids ' stuff . The mazes , arranged in order of difficulty , each have a complex set of rules that makes ' it incredibly tough to find the right way out . Maddening mazes is more like it . <p> Loose Balls : The Short , Wild Life of the American Basketball Association , 1967-76 by Terry Pluto ( Simon &; Schuster. $22.95 ) is either the great American novel in oral-history sound bites or the definitive book on the 1970s , or both : sex , drugs , platform shoes , sideburns , slam dunks , midnight franchise shifts , million-dollar deferred-payment player contracts , the three-point shot , Dr. J. , Marvin ( Bad News ) Barnes , LaVerne ( Jelly ) Tart and Pat Boone ( yes , Pat Boone ) . Pro sports , the way they ought a be . <p> For anyone who grew up watching Looney Tunes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without thinking of Bugs Bunny on tiptoe behind Elmer Fudd . For this thank that Wile E. composer Carl Stalling , who scored Warner Brothers ' cartoon shorts from 1936 to 1958 . No one ever made a symphony orchestra sound so nutty or so peculiarly wonderful . The Carl Stalling Project ( Warner . $15.95 ) is a wascally anthology of his work at Warners compiled by Greg Ford and Hal Willner . Merrie Melodies indeed . <p> The world today might be a far more perilous place for children than it was in 1937 , when Tin Pan Alley 's Gerald Marks and Irving Caesar published their Sing a song of Safety ! songbook . But since Marks and Caesar 's fundamental safety rules , like " Let the ball roll , no matter where it may go , " still apply , it 's good to know that the songbook , with its simple , catchy music and lyrics , is available once again ( Hardcover : Abrams. $19.95 . Paperback : Music Sales . $12.95 ) . <p> Fun with Hieroglyphs ( $19.95 ) sounds like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kit  --  with rubber stamps and ink pad  --  shows how to have it . The booklet ( by a Met Egypt maven ) decodes those mystic pictures and helps you write secret messages to friends . ( Judy , say , whose name would be cobra , quail chick , hand , two reed leaves . ) Final challenge : a crossword puzzle . More horned viper , quail chick , water than a barrel of monkeys . The dollar is shaky and recession is brewing , so you ca n't take the family to see the great monuments of Europe this year . But why not have the Duomo ' of Florence , Berlin 's Brandenburg . Gate and the Arch of Constantine in Rome come to you ? Get hold of an exquisite paper model of one of your favorite landmarks . They 're about one foot high and range from $19.95 to $55.95 . Part of the fun is putting them together  --  and some could take the 12 days of Christmas to do ( St. Basil 's Cathedral in Moscow , with its panoply of domes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specialty shops and Silver Visions Publishing Co. in Newton , Mass. 617-244-9504 . ) <p> For exercising brain cells in the evening , try what a friend of ours has done : give up reading and play computer games . Think-Lug Persons will be seduced by Leisure Suit Larry III : Passionate Patti in Pursuit of the Pulsating Pectorals ( Sierra . $59.95 ) . A balding nerd arrives at a Pacific island turned tourist trap . The player must guide him in his search for  --  what ? That 's part of the fun  --  trying to figure out what Larry must do as he moves from one place , and one bimbo , to the next . The astonishing color graphics include some harmless pixelated sex and the plot can be frustrating : steer Passionate Patti as she rides a log down a wild river while gremlins try to grab her . Witty and knowingly vulgar , the game takes about 40 hours to complete . ART <p> In Fanny Brennan 's tiny surrealistic paintings , a chair is dwarfed by a book , big airborne scissors cut a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in place by a giant needle and thread . The enchanting pictures  --  some only an inch or two square  --  cost $1,200 to $2,500 from the Coe Kerr Gallery in New York . If that 's too dear , buy Skyshades , a new little book that shows 60 of them actual size ( Clarkson Potter . $17.95 ) . <p> Two tickets to paradise : " Titles : Prince of Pitere " and " Anthony Van Dyck " ( National Gallery of Art , Washington , D.C. , through Jan. 27 and Feb. 24 , respectively ) . They 're both free ( gratis admission to federal museums is one of the things the government still does right ) . You probably wo n't see agathering of such masterful pictures again in your lifetime . Van Dyck is one of art history 's runner-ups ( along with Tintoretto and Braque ) , but the guy had a great ' wrist . Spend the whole day , then go home and burn your paint-by-numbers kit . <p> You 'll need a forklift to get the most magnificent art book of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Two Centuries of Regional Painting , by William H. Gerdts , in three volumes ( Abbeville. $425 ) is a winding trip across the country , away from the main urban art centers , in search of the most vital  --  but mostly unsung  --  painters Who captured American life on canvas from the early 18th century until the birth of modernism . <p> For those who find Ansel Adams and Edward Weston a little sweet , and Robert Frank and William Klein a little sour , Paul Strand is practically photographic perfection : abstractly precise but humbly confessional . This large-format book by Sarah Greenough ( Aperture . $100 ) will be hell to shelve , but the beauty of its superb reproductions is worth the inconvenience . So maybe you 've seen " Ranches de Taos Church " ( 1931 ) too often , but what 's Christmas without a chestnut ? DESIGN <p> This holiday season is rife with books for armchair travelers who also happen to be design fans . For these stay-at-homes , the chair is probably more important than the trip . A cushy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $5,000 , would be a dreamy gift . As for recommended destinations , start with Los Angeles and the hefty catalog to the American Arts &; Crafts show now at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art ( Bulfinch $55 , paper $29.95 ) . Sumptuous photos highlight the elegant proportions of furniture by Gustave Stickley and Frank Lloyd Wright ; a parade of intricate glazes makes the pottery section in the book pure pleasure . <p> Next stop : Manhattan Style by John Eaten with Rose Bennett Gilbert ( Little , Brown . $45 ) , a delicious historic romp through nearly 40 top New York City interiors . The book teems with decorator lore . Elsie de Wolfe , who shocked late Victorian sensibilities by promoting simplicity and neutral hues , is said to have exclaimed upon first seeing the Parthenon , " It 's beige ! Just my color ! " And across the sea , Celtic : and Style in Homes of Scotland , Ireland and Wales by Deborah Krasner ( Viking . $35 ) opens 30 houses to the reader , ranging from a rough-hewn cottage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County Limerick . <p> I. M. Pei : A Profile in American Architecture , by Carter Wiseman ( Abrams. $49.50 ) , is a behind-the-scenes look at how architecture reply works : the politics and pitfalls that bedevil a project from concept to finished building . Pei has pulled off such great successes as the Louvre pyramid because his charisma patience and determination are inextricably meshed with his design gifts . MUSIC <p> Acoustic Christmas ( Columbia . CD : $13.98 ) is n't for all time , maybe not even through Boxing Day . But it 'll stop Henry Mancini little-drummer-beyin ' his way through your holidays . Harry Connick Jr . ' s instrumental " Winter Wonderland " and Shawn Colvin 's breathy " Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas " are re-dos worth the doing . We 'd pass on Willie Nile 's angry " We Wish You a Merry Christmas , " but it 's a small lump o ' coal in a stylish stocking . <p> The only problem with the two brand-new Frank Sinatra CD collections is which to covet . The Capitol Years ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1962 , is the one for purists : lots of Nelson Riddle arrangements , songs like " Night and Day , " " Witchcraft , " " In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning " and the world 's best popular singer at the top of his form . So why even consider The Reprise Collection ( Four CDs : $69.98 ) , from 1960 to 19847 Well , not just for " Strangers in the Night , " " My Way " and " Theme from ' New York , New York ' "  --  yawn  --  but because it has his most adventurous work . George Harrison 's " Something " and the Jule Styne-Susan Burkenhead " It 's Sunday " ( recorded with just a guitar when Sin-atra was 67 ) were risky  --  and smart  --  choices . So , tough call . The Leonard Bernstein Edition ( Deutsche Grammophon. 12 CDs ) , a handsome boxed set , offers a good sampling of what made Lenny great . Most of the recordings are live , powerful and passionate . Eight feature the Vienna Philharmonic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are reissues , they 're affordable  --  about $100 for the set . <p> Restoring and recording American musicals of the ' 20s and ' 30s has become as fashionable as rehabbing old American houses . Two more shows have just been lovingly revivified : Jerome Kern 's little-known 1924 Sitting Pretty ( New World . Two CDs : $31.98 ) and George Gershwin 's 1930 dude-ranch epic , Girl Crazy ( Elektra Nonesuch . CD : $16.98 ) . Conductor John McGlinn , who brilliantly refloated " Show Boat " in 1988 , does the same for the sweet and delectably tuneful " Sitting Pretty , " a show that hints at the greatness that was just around a river bend . For the first time , " Girl Crazy " has been recorded complete . It would be impossible to replicate the original cast  --  Ethel Merman , Ginger Rogers and a pit band that included Benny Goodman , Glenn Miller and Gene Krupa . But with such songs as " I Got Rhythm " and " Embraceable You " and a highly charged bunch of singers , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Girl Crazy "  --  are invaluable . Do n't skip a word . <p> " God is in the house , " musicians would say when Art Tatum sat down at the piano . Now he can deify your house for the secular sum of $90 . Art Tatum : The Complete Pablo Group Masterpieces is a boxed set of six CDs of Tatum 's last sessions between 1954 and 1956 . He plays with men like trumpeters Roy Eldridge and Harry " Sweets " Edison , clarinetist Buddy DeFranco , tenor saxophonist Ben Webster , and drummers Buddy Rich and Jo Jones . Playing standards like " Lover Man " and " Night and Day , " DeFranco and Webster sound like wise men demonstrating the beauty of the laws of the universe ; Tatum sounds like a genius kid who 's discovered a new set of laws . He was . <p> From 1949 to 1963 television 's classy " Voice of Firestone " presented many of the leading names in opera on its weekly show . Footage from those programs is being released now for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost two dozen videos devoted to individual artists are already available ( VAI , , $19.95 and $29.25 ) . The videos offer a marvelous sampling of the magnetism of yesteryear 's stars . On " Eleanor $teber in Opera and Song " ( 1949-1952 ) the soprano 's radiant smile , luminous sound and dramatic credibility are unforgettable ; on " Leonard Warren in Opera and Song " ( 1949-53 ) the great baritone is as riveting rollicking through sea chanteys as he is singing  --  exquisitely  --  " Avant de quitter ces lieux " from Gounod 's " Faust . " <p> For an ear-opening bit of exotica , try a new CD called Kecak From Ball ( Bridge . $15.98 ) . Kecak is a theater spectacle that has its origins in trance rituals and tourist shows ; listening to the disc , you can sense a highly evolved art , like Kabuki , in there somewhere . But non-ethnographers need do no more than sit back and enjoy the extravaganzas of bizarrely patterned frenzy . There are moments when you could swear that dialogue from a samurai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band scrambling into a new formation ; The performers , a group called Kecak Ganda Sari , make a glorious racket . <p> The Byrds ( CBS . Four CDs : about $50 ) may not be the perfect retrospective ( guess why some of this stuff was " previously unreleased " ? ) but this was the most influential American band of the ' 60s . The Byrds virtually invented both folk-rock and country-rock : they knew steel guitars were hip long before Nashville did ; without them , there 'd be no Tom Petty or R.E.M . Indyspensyble . FILM <p> This was the year of Preston Sturges . Thirty-one years after the death of the great comic writer/director , his reputation reached its zenith with the release of his memoirs , a major biography and most of his work on video . Sturges believed in the healing power of laughter , and what makes a better gift than passing on the mirth ? First read about his improbable riches-to-rags life in Preston Sturges by Prestun Sturges ( Simon &; Schuster. $22.95 ) , compiled by his widow from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mercurial life story with the same exuberant wit that graced his peerlessly manic ' 40s comedies . Two of the most hilarious are Tbo Ludy Eve ( MCA . $29.95 ) , with Henry Fonda as a naive millionaire ensnared by the good/ bad gold digger Barbara Stanwyck , and the wild and woolly screwball comedy The Palm Beat# Story ( MCA . $29.95 ) , with Joel McCrae and Claudette Colbert . If your friends do n't laugh at these , make a New Year 's resolution to get new friends . <p> Everyone 's all too familiar with the flip side to holiday cheer : end-of-the-year blues . This year , why not indulge those downbeat feelings with a neo-Beat double feature of two movies fresh to video ? Bruce Weber 's Let 's Get Lost ( BMG. $89.98 ) is a black-and-white documentary about the jazz trumpeter and singer Chet Baker , but what it 's really about is the director 's infatuation with his glamorous , decaying subject . Weber makes a style out of lovelorn idolatry . Drugstore Cowboy ( IVE. $89.95 ) is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Northwest . Director Gus Van Sant has an erapathetic , delicate touch  --  he finds and charm in the lonely and the bleak . Matt Dilloh 's at his best as the ringleader . Whether you 're dipping deep into self-pity or nursing a case of melancholia , these videos could be just what Santa ordered . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : The godlike Tatum <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : the mercurial Sturges ( shown directing Fonda and Stanwyck in ' The Lady Eve ' ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : the folk-rocking Byrds are American classics well worth rediscovering  --  and hinting around for <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : Have yourself an arty little " Christmas with Fanny Brennan 's ' Tagged Tree , " a mother and child from ' Art across America , " I.M.
