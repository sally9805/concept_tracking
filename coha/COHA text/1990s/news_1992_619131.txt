<p> After having been a model for expansion teams , the Dallas Mavericks currently find themselves back at square one . <p> " Basically , we decided we 're not a playoff team , " said Norm Sonju , Dallas ' general manager and chief operating officer . <p> " We know we ca n't become the team we want to be with the cast we have now . The consensus among us all is that we need to concentrate on the people who will help down the road . That means more minutes for the younger guys and maybe making some trades . <p> " This is going to take time . This will not be a short-term process . " <p> Pardon the Mavs fans if they 're a little jaded , however . Since making the Western Conference finals in 1988 , the Mavs have gone downhill fast , primarily because of bad drafts and bad decisions , such as trying to build a team around center Roy Tarpley , currently banned from the NBA for repeated drug offenses . <p> Rick Sund , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold their breath . <p> " I think it 's going to take several years . I do n't want to give a number , but it 's down the line . Rebuilding is not an easy process . " <p> BIRD 'S OWN AGENDA <p> Boston 's Larry Bird , out indefinitely with a bad back , has always had his own agenda when it came to bouncing back from injuries , but that 's about to change . <p> " The thing Larry has to do is he ca n't mask or minimize his symptoms , " said Dave Gavitt , the Celtics ' executive vice-president . <p> Gavitt referred specifically to a back injury Bird suffered in a Celtics practice in early December . He told no one that it might be serious , and three weeks later , the problem developed into one that forced him onto the injured list for an unspecified period of time . <p> " If he had dealt with the discomfort when this first happened , " Gavitt said last week , " maybe we would have gotten rid of this problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I think what we should do is take the schedule away from Larry . " <p> VOTE-GETTING TECHNIQUES <p> At last look , Philadelphia 's Charles Barkley was the leading vote-getter in the East for the upcoming All-Star Game , which puzzled Chicago 's Michael Jordan . <p> " I need to write a book and then say I was misquoted , " Jordan said , " Or maybe I need to take a punch at somebody in Milwaukee . " <p> IT 'S NOW THE BIG FOUR <p> Is Cleveland 's Brad Daugherty among the " elite " centers in the NBA , along with Houston 's Hakeem Olajuwon , New York 's Patrick Ewing and the Spurs ' David Robinson ? Statistics so far this season say yes . <p> The Cavs , winners of 11 in a row through last weekend , had consecutive games against those teams recently and Daugherty outplayed each of his opponents in leading Cleveland to three straight victories . <p> The composite individual stats show Daugherty averaged 24 points a game on 21-for-33 shooting ( 63.6 percent ) against the troika @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " averaged just 16 points on 43.6 percent shooting against Daugherty . <p> " Brad has been terrific , " said Cavs coach Lenny Wilkens . " He 's been doing it night in and night out . When you talk about the league 's top centers , there 's no way to exclude him . They ( the Big Three ) are not doing anything that he is n't doing . He 's certainly a big key for us winning . " <p> EXPLAINING HIS 2 FOR 19 <p> When former Warriors guard Mitch Richmond missed his first 14 shots against Detroit last week , it looked as if he might challenge Tim Hardaway 's NBA record of 0 for 17 against Minnesota in December . <p> However , Richmond rebounded his own miss and put it back , ending his oh-fer at 14 and finishing the game 2 for 19 . <p> Unlike Hardaway , who offered no excuses after his 0-for-17 game , Richmond said there might have been a factor for his miserable shooting . <p> " I usually do n't like to complain , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of air in the ball . " <p> Uh , well , yeah , Mitch . Sure . <p> ISIAH AND POPULARITY <p> And you wonder why Detroit 's Isiah Thomas is n't exactly popular ? <p> Detroit 's Joe Dumars , red-hot in a game with San Antonio and coming off four straight jump shots , went the next six minutes without touching the ball . <p> " I do n't know why I did n't get the ball then , " said Dumars . " Maybe they just were n't calling my play . " <p> The " they " in this case refers to the point guard , who at the time was . . . <p> Well , you get the idea . <p> WORTH THE TROUBLE <p> With the kind of antics that you have to put up with to have Charles Barkley on your team , you 'd think most teams would shy away from making good on Philly owner Harold Katz 's wish to trade him . <p> But then . . . <p> " Charles is trouble , you know that going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But with a player like that , something inside me says you still take a shot because he 's a player who can make a difference . I do n't think you stay vanilla forever . From time to time , you roll the dice . You take a risk occasionally , and that 's healthy if you can add a tough , mean , SOB . " <p> THE BOSTON GARDEN HEX <p> There 's no hex like a Boston Garden hex , and the New York Knicks are here to testify . <p> Last week , when the Knicks played in Boston , the Celtics were without injured Larry Bird and Kevin McHale . Moreover , the Knicks took a 15-point lead . And yet , at the buzzer , it was the Celtics on top . <p> " No Bird , no McHale , a 15- point lead and we still ca n't get a win , " moaned Knicks guard Gerald Wilkins . " That 's pretty tough to take . " <p> New York has now lost 22 straight regular-season games at Boston Garden . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says center David Robinson is not being given the same treatment as other superstars in the league , and he 's wondering why . <p> " I think David should earn respect that other stars get , " Brown said yesterday . " I do n't think he gets that . " <p> Robinson says he does n't worry about that , however . <p> " If I do n't get that kind of respect , I 've just got to keep on working , " he said . " I 'm not worried about it , to be honest . If they choose not to respect me , or like me , or whatever , there 's not a whole lot I can do . " <p> As for his team , Robinson said the Spurs have a long way to go to earn the kind of respect that championship contenders should be given . <p> " When a team comes into your place and feels like it can beat you , that 's not a lot of respect . The Washington Bullets beat us twice , you know ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with the team getting respect . That has to do with coming out every night and being tough mentally and physically . That does n't necessarily mean beating people up or taking cheap shots at people , like some other teams , but it means coming out and being solid , not complaining , playing your game night in and night out . We have n't been consistent enough to earn that kind of respect . We 're getting to that point now with these last five or six games , though . " <p> CONFIDENCE IN UTAH <p> The Utah Jazz think they have something big happening in Salt Lake City this year . <p> " We used to go into a season , win 50 and squeeze all the potential we could out of those 50 wins , " Karl Malone said last week . " If you watched us , you knew our potential . All of a sudden , you do n't know our potential . We do n't know . <p> " . . . I 've never felt comfortable saying we were as good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . If you 're better than us , you 're going to have to go out and prove it . " <p> LEAVING THE SICK BED <p> Minnesota center Felton Spencer , down with the flu in Boston last week , dragged himself out of bed and scored 18 points to go with 11 rebounds to help Minnesota win a game at Boston Garden . <p> " If that 's what it takes , " said Wolves head coach and former Celtics coach Jimmy Rodgers , " then we have to find a way to get him the flu bug every time he steps on the floor . " <p> ROCKETS WO N'T PANIC <p> Despite losing 13 of 22 games , the Houston Rockets say they 'll stand pat on the trade front . <p> " This is not a point in time where you start panicking and distributing your roster to the rest of the NBA , " said Rockets general manager Steve Patterson . " Right now , some people in the organization just need to take stock of themselves and make more of a commitment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happened to Lakers forward James Worthy 's effectiveness , you 're not alone . <p> Coach Mike Dunleavy has watched Worthy 's career 54.6 percent shooting clip take a dive to 41 percent this season , and Worthy 's 20.5 points a game average is the lowest it 's been in four years . <p> " I do n't know that you can say teams are playing him differently now that Magic is gone , " Dunleavy said , " but there is a difference . The eye contact and the little things he and Magic had are n't there . It 's not just James . Everybody got more easy shots with Magic because he would draw some double-teams . James is probably seeing more of those now . " <p> WEST WO N'T TAKE IT <p> Lakers general manager Jerry West is irate over his team 's play this year , and after the Lakers dropped a home game to the road-awful Indiana Pacers , West let his players know that he 's not going to just sit and take it . <p> " Maybe some people have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team .
