To say that Pablo Picasso dominated Western art in the 20th century is , by now , the merest commonplace . Before his 50th birthday , the little Spaniard from Malaga had become the very prototype of the modern artist as public figure . No painter before him had had a mass audience in his own lifetime . The total public for Titian in the 16th century or Velazquez in the 17th was probably no more than a few thousand people  --  though that included most of the crowned heads , nobility and intelligentsia of Europe . Picasso 's audience  --  meaning people who had heard of him and seen his work , at least in reproduction  --  was in the tens , possibly hundreds , of millions . He and his work were the subjects of unending analysis , gossip , dislike , adoration and rumor . <P> He was a superstitious , sarcastic man , sometimes rotten to his children , often beastly to his women . He had contempt for women artists . His famous remark about women being " goddesses or doormats " has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk into both roles open-eyed and eagerly , for his charm was legendary . Whole cultural industries derived from his much mythologized virility . He was the Minotaur in a canvas-and-paper labyrinth of his own construction . <P> He was also politically lucky . Though to Nazis his work was the epitome of " degenerate art , " his fame protected him during the German occupation of Paris , where he lived ; and after the war , when artists and writers were thought disgraced by the slightest affiliation with Nazism or fascism , Picasso gave enthusiastic endorsement to Joseph Stalin , a mass murderer on a scale far beyond Hitler 's , and scarcely received a word of criticism for it , even in cold war America . <P> No painter or sculptor , not even Michelangelo , had been as famous as this in his own lifetime . And it is quite possible that none ever will be again , now that the mandate to set forth social meaning , to articulate myth and generate widely memorable images has been so largely transferred from painting and sculpture to other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duchamp , that cunning old fox of conceptual irony , has certainly had more influence on nominally vanguard art over the past 30 years than Picasso , the Spaniard was the last great beneficiary of the belief that the language of painting and sculpture really mattered to people other than their devotees . And he was the first artist to enjoy the obsessive attention of mass media . He stood at the intersection of these two worlds . If that had not been so , his restless changes of style , his constant pushing of the envelope , would not have created such controversy  --  and thus such celebrity . <P> In today 's art world , a place without living culture heroes , you ca n't even imagine such a protean monster arising . His output was vast . This is not a virtue in itself  --  only a few paintings by Vermeer survive , and fewer still by the brothers Van Eyck , but they are as firmly lodged in history as Picasso ever was or will be . Still , Picasso 's oeuvre filled the world , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His work expanded fractally , one image breeding new clusters of others , right up to his death .
