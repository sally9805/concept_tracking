<p> At the beginning of this decade , the residents of the Southwyck subdivision faced a grim outlook . <p> Southwyck 's developer was in bankruptcy and home sales were dead . <p> Southwyck also was fighting a deeply ingrained perception in the minds of many - that the south side of the Houston area was not a desirable place to live . <p> Then , in 1994 , three white knights appeared : veteran developer Larry Johnson ; a home-building investment arm of Prudential Insurance ; and Jefferson Development . <p> The realty triumvirate paid $ 6 million for the undeveloped acreage in the project . Southwyck was renamed . Millions were spent for marketing , more landscaping and improvements to bridges and sidewalks . <p> The result was Silverlake . Once an also-ran barely noticed in the sales rankings of major communities , Silverlake reached the No. 2 spot in Houston-area home starts by midyear 1997 , second behind only The Woodlands . <p> Silverlake is now selling homes at a pace comparable with Kingwood , First Colony and Cinco Ranch - some of the Houston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real estate projects make that kind of a comeback . <p> " It 's a hell of a restart . Most of the time it 's harder to bring one back , rather than start from scratch , " said housing analyst Mike Inselmann of American Metro/Study . " It 's a magic act . " <p> Inselmann believes the turnaround story of Silverlake is unmatched in the local housing business . <p> The community had 17 new-home starts in 1994 while it was still Southwyck , according to American Metro/Study . Last year , it had 560 construction starts , a huge increase over where it was three years before . <p> The key to the turnaround has been the consumer 's realization of what had been there all along : Silverlake , located off Texas 288 in the Pearland area , represents a 15-minute commute from Texas Medical Center and a quick drive from downtown . Among the area 's large-scale master-planned communities , 1,700-acre Silverlake is the closest to downtown . <p> The possibility of quick commuting is what prompted Randy Degner , a commodities trader who works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When his home is completed later this year , he will vacate his home in Lakewood Forest in northwest Harris County . His drive to work each day will be reduced from one hour ( or more when traffic is bad ) to just 20 minutes . <p> " I 'm kind of a family man and I did n't like the idea of getting home about 30 minutes before my kids go to bed every night , " Degner said . <p> Degner is not alone . Silverlake has drawn hundreds of home buyers who have been exploiting the easy commute via Texas 288 . The drive is not scenic - the land is flat and the trees are scrawny - but it is a quick drive in comparison to the lengthy torture time on most Houston freeways . <p> " All the freeways are congested everywhere else and 288 is n't , so they are migrating this way , " said Staci Hartfiel , Silverlake marketing director . <p> It is n't just Silverlake that is having great home sales . Southdown , West Oaks and other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers during the construction boom that has been surging in the area the last few years . <p> Other developers have noticed and they are quietly looking for other large tracts along Texas 288 for sites for new master-planned communities , said land broker John Santasiero of Riverway Properties . <p> It seems like the area has come full circle to where it was almost 20 years ago , when Houston developer Jeff Payson was scouting around the same territory looking for a new master-planned community site . <p> Payson was then chief executive of General Homes , which was building thousands of homes annually and developing dozens of subdivisions all over the Houston area . General 's appetite for land was ravenous . <p> After searching for sites in the far reaches of Harris and surrounding counties , the obvious finally became clear to Payson one day . " Maybe we ought to try 10 minutes south of the Medical Center , " said Payson , recalling the revelation with a wry twist of humor . <p> Payson knew the Texas 288 would be completed in the mid-1980s and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew it too , but it was definitely risky . <p> The key hurdle was that Payson would be developing in a developer 's no man 's land . <p> The South Side had no glamour . <p> " Whatever reputation it had , was bad , " Payson says . <p> Payson located what he thought was an ideal tract on the east side of Texas 288 at McHard Road . But while negotiations were under way , a major competitor , U.S. Home Corp. , swooped in and bought the site with a better offer . <p> So General 's site search moved farther south to FM 518 in Brazoria County . General purchased more than two dozen tracts of land from farmers and other landholders to assemble 1,700 acres that would be developed as Southwyck , Payson said . <p> The beginnings were not bad . Southwyck had a huge sales center with more than a dozen model homes at the intersection of FM 518 and Texas 288 . <p> More than 600 homes , mostly priced at less than $ 80,000 , were sold in Southwyck before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose dive , losing thousands of jobs in a contraction of the energy business . Foreclosures were widespread . Property values fell . <p> Home builders across the area had a tough haul . It was nearly impossible for a builder 's new homes to compete against the cheap inventory of used , foreclosed homes , which could be obtained for $ 50,000 or less . <p> Like other communities , Southwyck was in a real bind . <p> Payson decided to take a stab at the upper end of the housing market . Southwyck , after all , was close to the Medical Center and it was hoped that rich doctors would buy mansions around Southwyck 's 29-acre lake . General Homes built four mansions on a speculative basis . <p> " I do n't know what they were thinking . They had $ 700,000 in each of those homes , " said Michael Baldwin , who was a General salesman in the project at the time . <p> Baldwin tried for months to sell the mansions . But there were no takers . Upscale buyers turned up their noses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The General name had no snob appeal . The company was known for value-priced homes for the middle class . <p> " Who wants to buy a $ 400,000 General home ? " Baldwin said . <p> But going upscale was not General Homes ' biggest mistake in Southwyck . Trying to go solo on the project was the fatal flaw . <p> General Homes was the only builder in the whole project . That tactic works on smaller projects . But for a large master-planned community , most experts agree that having a variety of home builders works best . Each builder draws customers with its own marketing programs and its own loyal customer following . Consumers have a wider choice of builders and a wider selection of homes . <p> As the 1980s came to an end , General devised a plan to fix what was wrong with Southwyck . A tall clock tower was planned to create more of a " sense of arrival " and give the entry more character . Plain , stubby concrete markers would be replaced with new signs . <p> The Southwyck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with lots of small berms and water hazards , but few trees . But Southwyck 's homes were not located near the course and the course was not a prominent and visible part of the community . General 's second-chance plan would change that . <p> Also , General Homes anticipated allowing six or eight other home builders into Southwyck , giving up General 's monopoly on building , said Alan Bauer , director of corporate construction for General Homes . <p> " Our whole plan was to rectify our mistakes , " Bauer said . <p> But outside of Southwyck , General was having another set of problems . <p> General Homes , one of the biggest builders in the nation at the time , was caught in the trap that ensnared a number of other Texas builders . The company 's huge land holdings - an asset when a high-paced production builder needed a big supply of lots - became financial poison . General was forced into Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in July 1990 after creditors filed an involuntary bankruptcy petition . <p> The bankruptcy meant the detailed plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Homes emerged from bankruptcy in 1991 and it still constructs houses today . But as part of the bankruptcy workout , the builder 's real estate holdings were sold off by bankruptcy trustee Charles Lusk . <p> Lusk is a Houston real estate broker who heads a company named Realty Advisory Group . Lusk 's task was huge . His job was to sell the 4,800 acres of land , 1,200 lots , 50 completed houses and other assets in the General Homes liquidating trust to pay off creditors . The portfolio stretched from Phoenix to Florida . <p> Lusk said there were a lot of naysayers who thought the Texas 288 corridor was a loser , but he tried to sell the potential of south suburban Houston anyway . Southwyck consisted of 1,308 acres of land and the 201-acre golf course . <p> By midyear 1993 , after some heavy marketing efforts , Lusk had Southwyck under contract to be sold to a group led by Dallasite Ricky Strauss , son of Robert Strauss , the former national Democratic Party chairman . Strauss ' group was offering to pay the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several months , Strauss tried to lower his offer before the closing , Lusk said , so other buyers were lined up . <p> Around the end of 1993 , the trust sold the Southwyck golf course to National Golf Operating Partners for $ 4.2 million ; 188 acres to developer Clinton Wong for $ 2.3 million ; and the remainder of the land , about 1,100 acres , to the group led by Houston developer Larry Johnson for $ 6 million . <p> Johnson is a highly experienced land developer who has participated in developing Atascocita and Sienna Plantation locally , as well as large-scale projects in Arizona , Dallas , Atlanta and southern California . <p> Southwyck had a " dormant image , " Johnson said . But in Pearland Independent School District it had a good school system and a convenient location - the basics for success . <p> Johnson changed the project 's image , renaming it " Silverlake . " Money was poured into landscaping , sidewalks and fencing . And the new owners overcame what he perceived as the project 's biggest problem - having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of builders . <p> Today , the roster of builders in Silverlake includes Perry Homes , Plantation Homes , David Weekley Homes , Emerald Homes and Newmark Homes , in addition to several custom home builders . Prices range from more than $ 90,000 to $ 750,000 . <p> Silverlake 's sales are extremely brisk in 1998 , as the community enjoys the surge in sales that has swept over the Houston area in the last couple of years . The four mansions that were so difficult to sell eventually were sold . And more than 200 homes have been sold in Silverlake so far this year . <p> " I ca n't put lots on the ground fast enough , " said Tom Wilcox , who manages the project . <p> Although General Homes may have flubbed some of its execution of the project and it was undermined by the regional economic crash , the project basically was on the right track , Johnson said . <p> " They had the right idea , they just ran out of time , " Johnson said . <p> Johnson and his partner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had some significant financial backing . Prudential Home Building Investors , an arm of the Prudential Insurance Company of America , spent $ 5 million to buy into the development partnership . Prudential also provided a $ 12 million loan , said Robert Kilroy , managing director of Prudential Home Building Investors . <p> Kilroy said he is very pleased with the investment . " It was a very solid buy , " Kilroy said . " It was somewhat of a risk . There were uncharted waters down there in that northern part of Brazoria County . " <p> Kilroy said the growth of the area should encourage more retail construction . A service station and grocery store recently opened nearby . But as far as shopping is concerned , living in Silverlake is nothing like living near the Galleria . <p> Silverlake will begin to have more of an urban feel as it gets its first apartment project this year . <p> Martin Fein Interests recently purchased 10 acres in Silverlake , where it will develop a 236-unit project worth about $ 13 million . Construction will begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Homes , should be complete in 1999 . <p> But the amount of money earned by the developers of Silverlake will not be its most important and lasting impact on the Houston area . Its success means the south side of the Houston area will grow with more development . <p> And Silverlake 's success proves Payson 's vision to develop the community for General Homes was brilliant , even if his timing was horrible . <p> " General Homes was a real good home builder , " Lusk said . " They knew that was a good opportunity and a good corridor . "
