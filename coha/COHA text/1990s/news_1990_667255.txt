<p> Frederic Medway , 43 , a psychology professor at the University of South Carolina in Columbia , studies how military and other separations affect families . He was interviewed by USA TODAY 's Jenny Weil about the adjustments children of Desert Shield troops face , especially during this season of the year . Q : This holiday season , there are 270,000 U.S. troops in the gulf . How will their families cope emotionally with the separation ? <p> A : For many of these families , it will create significant stress . One thing the stay-at-home spouse often reports is a high degree of loneliness and feeling socially isolated . That person needs people to just talk to in everyday conversation . Q : Are there things to avoid mentioning in letters to loved ones in the gulf ? <p> A : What I recommend is that in letters or in tapes that are sent overseas , you just do n't mention significant events . You do n't mention that the son got bad grades on the report card , or you do n't mention that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you write about ? <p> A : You describe routine things , like a television show you happened to watch , a play you saw . The stay-at-home spouse needs to be able to share those things with somebody he or she loves , and I believe the soldiers need to hear that to help their integration back into the family . Q : Many of the troops are mothers and fathers of young children . How will the separation affect the children ? <p> A : There is not a lot of research on the military family over the last 20 years , and what has been done focuses primarily on the spouse who stays at home rather than dealing with the kids . I 'm trying to be very generic and non- sexist , but the research is really based on females who stay at home . There do n't seem to be any long-term problems associated with military separation for the children . The problems seem to exist during the separation itself and maybe for two , three or four months after the soldier comes back . Q @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a parent is going away ? <p> A : They 're worried that their father 's not coming back , that something may happen to the him . The younger kids , anywhere from 4 1/2 to about 9 , are certainly going to have more difficulty with this situation , especially with Operation Desert Shield because they do n't understand what 's happening . It 's a little easier for the older ones to deal with . Q : Do the worries or anxieties translate into behavioral problems ? <p> A : Sometimes we see behavioral problems . There may be declining school performance , or increases in disciplinary problems around the home . What seems to determine a lot of that is really the mother 's own response to the absence . Q : After the initial reactions , do the children generally settle into a routine ? <p> A : We may see some of these problems develop , and then after about three months , the kids seem to be able to cope with the situation relatively well . They go back to living within their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Do boys and girls handle the separation the same way ? <p> A : The separation impacts upon males more so than females . Fathers being absent from the home seem to result in less modeling of the boy on the father 's behavior . Another aspect of this seems to be that when the fathers leave , the mothers may change their parenting style . Q : In what ways ? <p> A : They may become more protective , more structured , more punitive , and generally , they 're more likely to act that way with their sons than with their daughters . Another factor seems to be that , occasionally , when you have families with an older male and a younger male , there seems to be an increase in aggression in some of these acting-out behaviors in the older male that the younger male may pick up . Q : When there are behavioral problems , do the studies measure exactly what the child may be reacting to ? <p> A : Very few of the studies suggest there 's a direct effect on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the studies more often say is that when the soldier goes off , it creates certain tension in the home , which then affects the child . Q : Such as ? <p> A : Many of these families have increased financial problems . With more tension in the home , we often see a breakdown in how the stay-at-home parent is dealing with the children . The issue is how a stay-at-home spouse responds to the separation . Q : What does the research show ? <p> A : The initial response seems to be one of denial . In other words , denying that this is really happening , denying that the spouse is being sent overseas . This involves a lot of unhappiness at this time . Then after that , and I ca n't give you an exact timeline , there seems to be anger and , occasionally , depression . Q : How is that anger expressed ? <p> A : This anger can be expressed toward the military system and toward commanding officers . Occasionally , the anger is expressed toward the military person by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind that what 's going to happen is that person who stays at home is going to be faced with increasing responsibilities . In addition to the financial problems , there 's going to be a lot of stress , especially if that stay-at-home spouse is a full- time worker and also has to be a full-time parent and a full-time house manager . Q : When the soldier comes home , how do families handle the reunion ? <p> A : Some families do very poorly during reunion because when the soldier comes back , he reports a lot of difficulty fitting back into the family and re-establishing the normal family roles that , you can imagine , in military families tend to be relatively traditional . For example , the man still earns the most money and still has a very important position as a disciplinarian and authority figure in the family . He may have difficulty re-establishing himself when he gets back . Q : During reunion , what stages or cycles do the children go through ? <p> A : I would say , certainly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband and wife , then the child , given all that family dysfunction , is liable to have even more problems . Q : Is there anything positive that could come out of this for the children ? <p> A : They may become more adaptable and learn how to share love and possibly learn how to deal with life 's stresses . Children get some practice in dealing with and understanding some difficult situations that are beyond their control . This can maybe help them deal with a different crisis that they may have to face at another time in life . CUTLINE : Frederic Medway
