<p> CHARLES HARRIS is in Mexico posting his version of Old West " Wanted " posters . <p> WANTED : A clean Mexican judge . <p> REWARD : $ 300,000 for anybody who can collect an unpaid loan in a Mexican court without paying a bribe or illegally influencing the judge . <p> Since 1982 , Mr. Harris has been trying to recoup a $ 110,000 loan made to the director of a Spanish language school in Michoacan . Although the loan was made here in front of Mexican witnesses , Mexican courts have ruled they have no jurisdiction because Harris and the school director are United States citizens . The US courts say they have no jurisdiction over a Mexican business contract . <p> Now on his fourth lawyer , Harris says : " All my lawyers tell me that I 'm not winning because I 'm not paying the judge . " <p> The Harris challenge - and other recent cases of alleged corruption - touch on a familiar complaint by foreigners doing business in Mexico : Even under reform-minded President Carlos Salinas de Gortari , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal recourse for those who buck the system . <p> Many acknowledge that President Salinas has reduced red tape and made it easier for foreign businesses to operate without resorting to illegal payoffs . But the problem remains well-entrenched , they say . And the issue of corruption is now starting to catch the attention of those opposing the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) . <p> " High-level government complicity in corruption is a powerful argument against free trade . It will be one of the most important issues in next year 's elections and it would be extremely naive not to be concerned about it , " says Ricardo Pascoe , a close adviser to Cuauhtemoc Cardenas , presidential candidate for the left-leaning Party of the Democratic Revolution . NAFTA considerations <p> In the US , Sen. Ernest Fritz Hollings ( D ) of South Carolina has questioned whether NAFTA would open the door to more " free trade or fee trade . " <p> Politicians and organizations questioning the wisdom of uniting widely disparate business cultures and legal systems under NAFTA are likely to focus not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more explosive International Business Machines Corporation ( IBM ) scandal . <p> The story broke Feb. 3 in The Financial Times , where British businessman Kaveh Moussavi alleged that IBM 's division in Bethesda , Md. , lost a $ 21 million bid to update Mexico 's air traffic control system because it failed to pay a $ 1 million bribe . <p> Mr. Moussavi was approached on Nov. 9 , he says , by three men in the lobby of the Hotel Nikko in Mexico City . They refused to give their names , but as " credentials " they showed Moussavi government confidential documents and discussed how IBM could " win " the bid . <p> " I was IBM 's agent . I was eating , sleeping , and dreaming this tender . But these guys knew it better than I did , " says Moussavi in a telephone interview . <p> Moussavi returned to his room and called his boss in the US . They agreed US law forbids such payments . But the payment could be legal if the three men could prove they were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials , he recounts in a detailed account published in Proceso , a Mexican news magazine . <p> Moussavi went back to the lobby , but the men refused to reveal their identities . Ten days later , the bidding was canceled . In December , a new round of bidding was held under new specifications and French and Italian firms won the contract . IBM officials back article <p> IBM officials in the US backed the idea to go to The Financial Times , Moussavi says . " IBM was outraged when they lost . They were outraged not only because they lost , but they lost for the wrong reasons . They were absolutely determined to expose the corruption , " he says . <p> Moussavi cites a Dec. 16 letter from Roger Boyd of IBM which states : " I am now relatively certain that the cancelation of the previous bid was engineered by someone with influence who needed some way to lower their price . " <p> But when the story broke on Feb. 3 , IBM and its Mexican subsidiary , which was not involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's claims . IBM denied a bribe had occurred . A brief investigation ensued . On Feb. 19 , the Mexican government ended the investigation , saying neither Moussavi nor IBM had been able to provide any evidence of a bribe . <p> Moussavi is furious . He calls it a " complete and cowardly " coverup to protect corrupt Mexican officials and IBM de Mexico 's interests . In the coming weeks , Moussavi will file a defamation and breach of contract suit against IBM in the US and will seek punative damages amounting to " millions , " according to his attorney Robert Perry , a partner at Wilkes , Artis , Hedrick , &; Lane , a Washington law firm . <p> Moussavi says IBM abandoned him and taped conversations will prove his story . He also scorns the Mexican government 's investigation . <p> " The sum total of the investigation is a half-page fax to my lawyer with two questions . They never asked if I could describe the men , what they were wearing , did they speak English , any distinctive features , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relates . <p> " Imagine you 're walking down the street and witness a bank robbery and report it . The police then ask only two names and did they work at the bank ? If you answer no , would it be fair to end the investigation and conclude the bank was never robbed ? " <p> Moussavi says he also intends a defamation suit against IBM of Mexico and Andres Caso Lombardo , who was , until last week , the secretary of communication and transportation . <p> How far is such legal action in Mexico likely to get ? Moussavi asked a well-known Mexican lawyer to take his case . The lawyer wrote back on March 24 , before Mr. Caso stepped down , stating : " A penal accusation against a current minister has n't a chance to prosper , and I do n't advise you bring it if in your perspectives are business in Mexico . " <p> Moussavi says he 's done business in Mexico for years . " This was n't the first time I 'd been approached for a bribe . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought the atmosphere had changed ... I was naive . " <p> A Mexican government spokesman rebuts Moussavi 's sweeping conclusions . " There are many foreign companies in Mexico who have been here for years without any trouble or complications . Look at the figures for foriegn investment : in excess of $ 25 billion over the last four years . That 's a very good sign of how investors feel about coming to Mexico . " <p> Nonetheless , US congressional sources say they will dig into the issue . On April 29 , the Senate Commerce Committee will be holding hearings on NAFTA . Moussavi has n't yet been invited to testify . But a senior congressional staffer says , " The Moussavi case will be making the rounds on Capitol Hill as a prime example of the risks you take when doing business in Mexico . "
