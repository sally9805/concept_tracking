Of all the Tarheels of North Carolina , nobody has more tar on his heels than Republican Jesse Helms . At 74 , Helms has served in the Senate for 23 years , and has got himself so happily stuck there as a leading proponent of archconservative values that he appears virtually inextricable . <P> It would seem the height of cockeyed optimism for anyone to try to unshoe him ; yet not one , but two cockeyed optimists are contending in North Carolina 's Democratic primary next week for the sporting honor of challenging the Senator when he runs for a fifth term in November . One is Harvey Gantt , an architect and former two-term mayor of Charlotte who pulled off a respectable 47% to Helms ' 53% of the vote when he tried to dislodge Helms in 1990 . The other is Charlie Sanders , a millionaire physician , educator , onetime pharmaceuticals executive and a newcomer to politics . <P> Apart from the fact that Gantt is an African American , there is little to distinguish one candidate from the other . Gantt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader ; Sanders , 64 , is a heart specialist , an eminently confident sort of suture-self surgeon . <P> Sanders is an example of several neophytes who have been drawn into politics by Nebraska Senator Bob Kerrey , chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee . Kerrey is convinced that there is not enough new blood among his fellow Senate Democrats and so has persuaded successful , energetic businessmen like Sanders  --  among them Oregon 's Tom Bruggere , South Carolina 's Elliott Close and Idaho 's Walter Minnick  --  to challenge Republican candidates . <P> That explains why Sanders is in contention , although ( as Sanders admits ) voters who try to discern sharp ideological distinctions between him and Gantt will be disappointed . As a result , the primary race is mainly a battle of images . Gantt , who grew up poor , lards his campaign speeches with inspirational stories about his ill-educated , hardworking father ( a mechanic ) and his " Mama who fed us values . " Sanders , who taught medicine at Harvard , ran Massachusetts General Hospital , became vice chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the giant pharmaceutical company Glaxo , presents himself as a serious , concerned authority figure . <P> Gantt 's people argue that Sanders , who until recently was a registered independent , is nothing more than a faux Democrat . " He seems to have found his issues based on some kind of sophisticated campaign model , " says Gantt campaign manager Jim Andrews . " I 'm not sure he believes any of it . " Nevertheless , Sanders ' advertising campaign has been effective , quickly driving up his name recognition from 20% to 60% . " I 'm someone who knows health care , education and business creation , " he says . " Been there , done that . " Says Ted Arrington , professor of political science at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte : " Sanders ' ads hit all the right chords . People see that he 's a CEO and an M.D.  --  that he has the stature to beat Helms. "
