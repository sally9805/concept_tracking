<p> A psychotherapeutic cult led by an ex-disciple of Lyndon LaRouche is becoming the most powerful voice on Africa policy in Congress . <p> Last April , one of the most bizarre lobbies ever invited to give congressional testimony appeared before Wisconsin Democrat David Obey 's House Subcommittee on Foreign Operations . Under consideration was the Bush Administration 's annual foreign aid request for Zaire . A man who identified himself as " Abukari , director of the Africa desk " for the Rainbow Lobby , urged the subcommittee to halt government-to-government economic aid and all military aid to Mobutu Sese Seko 's regime . He then ran down the familiar litany of charges against the dictator , most prominently endemic corruption and human rights abuses . In the main , these complaints are true . The administration , however , points to Zaire 's strategic position , and to Mobutu 's helpful regional diplomacy and halting steps toward political liberalization as reasons to keep the US. aid spigot open . <p> Putting aside the merits of the aid question , a look at the Rainbow Lobby 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an integral link in a bigger , insidious psycho-political web . In an age when the level of tolerance for serious scandal is at an all-time high , in a political culture devoid of moral probity or discrimination , the ease with which a group like the Rainbow Lobby has emerged as a credible , and indeed influential , voice on important questions of public policy in Congress and in the media , still has the capacity to shock . It is a small window on the cynical and debased manner in which the nation 's business is conducted in the capital these days . <p> A report issued last January by the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith identified the Rainbow Lobby  --  not to be confused with Jesse Jackson 's Rainbow Coalition  --  as one of several " front groups " of the New Alliance party , founded eleven years ago by Fred Newman , whose theories on integrating psychology and politics the party and its affiliates follow . The ADL report characterizes the party as " part Marxist sect , part therapy cult , " whose politics are an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ references . . . anti-Semitism and an intense anti-Israel bias . " <p> Fred Newman , who earned a Ph.D . in the philosophy of science from Stanford University in the early 1970s , has a long association with fringe groups . He joined Lyndon LaRouche 's National Caucus of Labor Committees in 1974 , and later helped form the International Workers party , dedicated to " international socialist revolution . " Newman and his followers broke off to form the New Alliance party in 1979 . In addition to his role on the NAP 's executive board , Newman operates a dozen " medical and therapeutic " centers in major cities in the US . <p> A 1989 report by Chip Berlet of Political Research Associates , an independent institute in Massachusetts that keeps tabs on cults , began : " The New Alliance Party describes itself as a black-led , women-led , multi-racial , pro-gay independent political organization . Its most outspoken critics call it an opportunistic political movement controlled by an unethical therapy cult whose white male guru once led his followers into an affiliation with neo-fascist cult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1987 deposition , Dennis Serrette , the NAP 's presidential candidate in 1984 who later left the party , called Newman 's group therapy " a way of controlling every aspect of members ' lives . " Serrette , who was testifying for the defense in a lawsuit the party brought against a black-owned newspaper in Mississippi that had been critical of the NAP , continued : " Newman teaches that morality is bourgeois , and places himself in the position of determining right and wrong for organization members . So , for example , monogamous relationships are deemed bourgeois . Members often sleep with the lovers of their best friends so that no personal relationships or loyalties surpass one 's loyalty to Newman .... A poignant example of Newman shaping the organization 's morality was demonstrated in the last organization-wide meeting I attended .... The theme of this meeting was ' to kill . ' It was not enough to give your life for the cause , you had to be ready to kill for it . " <p> The ADL described the therapy 's approach similarly : " Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . The role of the radical therapist is to lead the individual to overthrow the dictatorship of the ' bourgeois ego ' and to liberate the proletarian ego ' by means of personal revolutions , " including demonstrations of " overt sexuality . " Newman was quoted in the winter 1990 issue of Practice , an NAP journal , as saying : " I do n't like the institution of the family in any of its forms . " <p> Serrette testified that the therapy centers are the primary funding source for the party ; Newman , in a telephone interview , would acknowledge only that the centers " may make contributions " to the party . Party members are made to undergo  --  and in some cases are recruited from  --  the group therapy sessions , for which they pay an hourly fee on a sliding income-based scale . One such Newman operation in New York , the Center for Short Term Psychotherapy , treats " several hundred " patients a month and grossed about $45,000 a month last year , Newman says . <p> There are fewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but its reach extends further . In 1988 , the NAP presidential ticket , headed by Dr. Lenora Fulani . " director of social therapy " for the Newman centers , was on the ballot in all fifty states , qualified for federal matching funds , and received 201,430 votes , about one-quarter of one percent of the total . In New York City , the party has made more significant inroads ; its candidate for City Council president , Rafael Mendez , received 193,842 votes , or 25 percent of the total , in the September 1989 primary . <p> In New York and Chicago the party has sought to exploit the cleavages between segments of the black and Jewish communities by embracing black Muslim leader Louis Farrakhan as " the most progressive religious leader on the American political landscape , " and a " leading target of Zionist terror . " Attempting to forge an alliance with New York 's noted charlatan , the Rev. Al Sharpton , Fulani and other party members marched in support of Tawana Brawley , whose 1988 claims of rape were later discredited . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named after a party member , where about a hundred students study a curriculum " based on the theories of Soviet psychologist Lev Vygotsky , " according to the American Psychological Association 's newspaper , the APA Monitor . The introduction to the curriculum begins : " The basic foundation of the curriculum is the perspective of historical materialism . It is not the history of great men ; it is the history of the organization of production . " <p> The party 's foreign-policy positions include support for Qaddafi 's Libya and the Palestine Liberation Organization . In April 1987 , Fulani and Rainbow Lobby Director Nancy Ross headed an NAP delegation to Tripoli to " commemorate ... the genocidal U.S. bombing of the Gulf of Sidra and the Libyan Coast , " according to the National Alliance , the NAP 's newspaper . The Hon. Qaddafi received the NAP group . At a 1989 reception in New York , again marking the anniversary of the Libya bombing , Fulani , Newman , and a Qaddafi emissary calling himself Dr. El Moakkif shared a dais . Newman told the assembled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Libyans , the Congolese people , the Palestinians , and others . " In April 1988 , the National Alliance published an article headlined " In Memoriam " on the death of Palestinian terrorist Abu Jihad , which it attributed to a " Zionist murder squad . " <p> The NAP 's sympathy for the radical Arab cause is only part of the story . Statements by NAP founder Fred Newman are characterized by the ADL as " tainted with anti-Semitism . " In the National Alliance of October 25 , 1985 , Newman referred to Jews as " the storm troopers of decadent capitalism , " who had " sold their souls to the devil  --  international capitalism . " He also spoke of the " dirty Jew . . . a self-righteous dehumanizer and murderer of people of color . . . a racist bigot . " ( Newman , who is himself Jewish , confirms making the statements but says they were " not anti-Semitic . " ) <p> The ADL identified eighteen front groups used by the party to generate political and financial backing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Progressive Helping Professionals . By far the most successful of these appears to be the Washington , D.C.-based Rainbow Lobby , which began operations in 1985 and has since enmeshed several members of Congress and their aides in a dangerous totalitarian political cult . " It 's just like the traditional Communist party front groups . The Rainbow Lobby ostensibly operates on its own , but it serves the ends of the New Alliance party , " says David Evanier , the author of the ADL report . <p> Lobby Director Nancy Ross , a Newman-trained therapist , founding member of the NAP , and the party 's vice presidential candidate in 1984 , characterizes the Rainbow Lobby as " the eleventh largest grass-roots lobby in the country , with about 160,000 members nationwide . " It has seven regional offices and about sixty employees . I recently dropped by the L Street office in downtown Washington to have a look . The waiting area is filled with National Alliance party propaganda , amid the requisite generic photos of starving African children . Around the corner , about a dozen staffers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the like . Ross , pressed on how many of the lobby workers are members of the New Alliance party , will say only that membership is " not required . " Based on the number of dazed expressions in the office , my guess is that most are Newmanites . <p> Ross says the lobby works " extremely closely " with the party but is " an independent organization , " a fiction used to deceive many of those who contribute to or work with the lobby . In 1989 , the National Alliance was more candid in linking the party 's " outreach efforts " to the formation of the Rainbow Lobby in 1985 . The results " were startling .... Within weeks canvassers were raising between $50 and $100 in one evening shift .... By 1988 , the lobby had dozens of canvassers in the field , was running a telemarketing operation to reach contributors for follow-up donations , and grossed $548,000 . In 1989 , the lobby has put sixty canvassers in the field and projects that it will gross $1.2 million . " Ross confirms that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise $1.5 million this year , making it one of the fastest growing properties on the left today . The group 's tax records for 1989 show that it spent more than $850,000 on lobbying activities last year , putting it in a league with the National Rifle Association and the AFL-CIO . <p> In addition to tax records , lobby reports filed with the clerk of the U.S. House point to a curious money circle encompassing the National Alliance party and its front groups . The strongest flow appears to be from the therapy centers to the lobby to the party . Virtually the same group of contributors are listed in each reporting period . One benefactor , for instance , Dr. Susan Massad , gave $5,000 to the lobby in 1988 ; according to advertisements placed in the National Alliance newspaper , Massad is the " medical director " of two Newman centers in New York , the Harlem and Bronx Institutes for Social Therapy and Research . In turn the lobby 's expenditures go largely to NAP I fronts , including the U.S.-Congo Friendship Committee , Alliance Press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Castillo Center . Rainbow Lobby employees are listed as hefty donors to the NAP in its Federal Election Commission filings . <p> Ross contends that the lobby is financed solely through its door-to-door canvassing for two bills the lobby has gotten introduced in Congress . Rep. John Conyers 's ( D-Mich . ) Fair Elections Bill-co-sponsored by Reps . Donald Payne ( D-N.J . ) , Bruce Morrison ( D-Conn. , and a candidate for governor in that state this fall ) , Joseph Kennedy II ( D-Mass. ) and Sidney Yates ( D-Ill. ) , among others  --  would make it easier for third-party candidates to get on federal ballots . The Democracy in Presidential Debates Act , sponsored by Reps . Jim Bates ( D-Cal . ) , Kweisi Mfume ( D-Md. ) , and Timothy Penny ( D-Minn. ) , would require candidates who qualify for federal matching funds to be included in presidential debates . Both bills , of course , would directly benefit the New Alliance party , though the canvassers do n't mention the connection . The congressmen , however , ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earlier this year , Ross brought Lenora Fulani to the Hill and hosted a coffee hour for interested legislators to generate support for the debates bill . In addition to Bates , Mfume , and Penny , Reps . Ed Markey ( D-Mass . ) , Gerry Studds ( D-Mass. ) , and Rep. James Oberstar ( D-Mich. ) showed up . <p> In its original incarnation as the Rainbow Alliance Lobby in 1984 , the group lobbied on " electoral reform " issues for the NAP , the Peace and Freedom party , and other small leftist parties . Only in 1985 did the renamed Rainbow Lobby turn its attention to Zaire , though the National Alliance party had long been following developments there . This was the result of NAP 's " fraternal ties with the Congolese National Liberation Front , " a Marxist guerrilla group that led an unsuccessful military uprising in Zaire in the mid-1970s , according to the September/October 1989 issue of Probe , an NAP periodical . Evincing the sectarianism that has made the party anathema even to many on the extreme left , Probe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " establishment Communist-Party left " was putting its resources behind the regime in Angola and the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa . " The Rainbow Lobby , guided by the tendency which refused to let it take the centrist route , now blossoms while the rest of the African liberation movement withers . " <p> In carving out a niche like Zaire policy , the Rainbow Lobby has blossomed by default , demonstrating how simple it is for just about any crackpot to traverse the Beltway and become a seemingly legitimate part of the policy establishment . The rapidity with which the lobby found an eager audience for its political poison in Congress is a sign of just how terribly sick the institution is today . The advance of the lobby puts in question whether there are any limits whatever on the power wielded over Congress by lobbies , no matter what they stand for , or who is behind them . " The Lobby 's role ... attracted new respect on the Hill , " the Probe article recounted . " Journalists began to identify the lobby as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington with a direct line into what was happening in Zaire . " None of the lobby 's officials has ever even been to Zaire , but they have been quoted in the Boston Globe , the Washington Post , and the Wall Street Journal as experts or advocates on Zaire , without a mention of the lobby 's wider political connections . In another sign of the lobby 's growing acceptance , on November 16 it will hold a conference on U.S. policy toward Zaire at Washington 's venerable Brookings Institution . <p> The lobby 's first big foreign-policy success came in 1987 , when Rep. Ronald V. Dellums ( D-Cal. ) agreed to introduce a bill co-authored by the Rainbow Lobby ( and reintroduced last year by Dellums ) , that called for an end to military aid to Zaire . At a meeting with Dellums aide Bob Brauer , Probe reported , " Ross asked if Dellums would take on Zaire . Brauer was responsive ... " In December 1987 , the Rainbow Lobby escorted to Capitol Hill Etienne Tshisekedi wa Mulumba , of the Zairean dissident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with several congressmen , including Dellums , who at the lobby 's behest hosted a reception for Tshisekedi at the Congressional Black Caucus , and Rep. Howard Wolpe ( D-Mich. ) , who did the same at his House Africa subcommittee . In 1988 , following Tshisekedi 's arrest in Zaire , the lobby convinced Rep. Robert Mrazek ( D-N.Y. ) to circulate a letter to House colleagues requesting signatures on a protest to Mobutu threatening a cut in U.S. aid . The letter was signed by Dellums , Wolpe , and twenty other members . <p> At an April 27 press conference this year , Ross made her baldest statements to date about the lobby 's impact in the Capitol . She said that in response to " pressure " from her group , " significant members of Congress have unequivocally condemned Mobutu 's regime , and called for an end to all U.S. military aid . " She specifically claimed credit for " very strong anti-Mobutu statements " issued by Rep. Stephen Solarz ( D-N.Y. ) , a ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee , Rep. Wolpe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an end to U.S. aid to Zaire in statements made just prior to the Rainbow Lobby 's April 4 testimony . <p> This was a precursor to the main event , the June 13 Obey subcommittee mark-up of the foreign aid appropriations bill for 1991 . After the way in which Obey drooled over the lobby 's testimony in April , the subcommittee surprised no one by reporting out a bill that would ban all military and direct economic aid to the Mobutu regime . It would allow about $50 million in development assistance and food aid to be channelled through private voluntary organizations in Zaire . The full House approved the bill June 28 and the Senate is taking up the issue now . The bills will then go to a House Senate conference . Last year , the Rainbow Lobby pushed the conference committee to zero out all military aid , and ended up securing a $3 million spending cap . This year even the Bush Administration seems to be going with the flow . It requested $9 million in military support last year , but cut it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , serves the purposes of the Marxist Angolan regime , as Mobutu has allowed funds and weapons for the anti-Communist rebel forces led by Jonas Savimbi to be funneled through Zaire . A March 1990 " Democracy Action Alert " from the lobby was more direct , calling for a cutoff of U.S. aid to Savimbi and " diplomatic recognition to the government of Angola . " One staff member of the House intelligence committee , which voted narrowly in September to approve the Bush Administration 's request of about $50 million in military aid to Savimbi 's forces for next year , says the committee has been inundated with materials from the lobby , as well as requests for meetings on the issue . To his knowledge , no such meetings were scheduled . <p> Another lobby favorite in Africa is the Polisario Front of the Western Sahara . The Polisario guerrillas , backed by Soviet client Algeria , have been fighting a war of " liberation " against Morocco for control of the territory since 1975 , when Spain handed over its former colony to Morocco . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in April 1989 , Ross implored Congress to cut Morocco 's U.S. aid , which last year topped $120 million . ( The U.S. receives crucial access for its rapid deployment forces on military bases in Morocco . ) " We would like to meet with you to discuss formulating an appropriate legislative response to the Western Sahara situation , " Ross wrote . Within a few weeks , the Rainbow Lobby received an invitation to a private early morning meeting of Rep. Wolpe 's House Africa subcommittee to consider U.S. policy in the area . Last fall , Ross accompanied two Polisario executive committee members to meetings she arranged with several congressmen , including Wolpe , Solarz , Payne , and Reps . Robert Torricelli ( DN.J. ) and Chet Atkins ( D-Mass. ) , and Sen. Chuck Robb ( D-Va . ) . <p> The Justice Department is investigating whether the lobby 's activities on behalf of the Polisario Front are in violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act . The lobby is not registered with the department to represent foreign governments or parties . In a June 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joseph E. Clarkson , the chief of the department 's Registration Unit , Deborah Green , the lobby 's political director , stated that the lobby did not have to be so registered because " none of our efforts are in support of any American or foreign party , government or individual per se . " This statement is contradicted by an article in the May 17 , 1990 issue of the National Alliance , which contained this false claim : " The Rainbow Lobby is the registered representative of the Polisario Front . " ( The foreign agents act is a criminal statute , with violations bringing heavy fines and jail sentences . ) <p> The final area of Rainbow Lobby interest these days is Haiti , where it opposes the dictatorship of Gen. Prosper Avril ( the group tends to pick issues of particular interest to black Americans , apparently as part of the National Alliance party 's outreach effort ) . In June , the lobby planned to hold a briefing on U.S. policy in Haiti on Capitol Hill . But when Ross called Francine Marshall , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to request the use of a room in the Capitol building , Ross says she was told : " We know who you are , what your connections are , and you 're not going to get the room . And I 'm going to see to it that nobody up here attends your briefing . " Ross then turned to Mike Frazier , an aide to Sen. Edward Kennedy ( D-Mass. ) for help . Frazier  --  after being warned by a House aide ( other than Marshall ) that Kennedy ought not lend his name to the group  --  called the Senate Rules Committee and secured a room for the lobby in Kennedy 's name . The briefing turned out to be a big draw , attracting aides to Sens . Frank Lautenberg ( D-N.J. ) and Barbara Mikulski ( D-Md. ) , and Reps . Sam Gejdenson ( D-Conn . ) , Clifford Stearns ( R-Fla. ) and John Porter ( R-Ill. ) , among others . ( A good number of the aides , of course , may have been doing nothing more than collecting information on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the source , however , before they act on such " facts . " ) <p> Certainly it is in the nature of lobbies to exaggerate their actual influence . On Zaire , for example , Mobutu had foes on Capitol Hill long before the Rainbow Lobby was founded , perhaps deservedly so . Yet the lobby 's work undoubtedly has raised the profile of the issue and thus made a substantial difference . Greg Simpkins , an analyst at the pro-Savimbi Angola Peace Fund in Washington , says : " They 've gotten lots of members to speak out against aid to Zaire who ordinarily probably would n't get involved in the issue . Partly , they work through intimidation  --  no liberal wants to be called a Mobutu apologist . Their impact is more with aides than members , who in effect act as their political commissars . " The question remaining is whether congressional aides like Kennedy 's Frazier , who give legitimacy and respectability not only to the Rainbow Lobby but to the politics of the National Alliance party , know who their friends really are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instance , Rep. Mervyn Dymally ( D-Cal. ) , recounted this experience with the lobby : " Mr. Speaker , on a more personal note , some time ago this group came to me , and believing they were part of Jesse Jackson 's operation the Rainbow Coalition , I , of course , greeted them very warmly and began working with them . I worked with them on some matters on Haiti , and I worked with them on matters on Zaire , and on one occasion they brought the opposition leaders from Zaire to meet with me . " It was only later , says Dymally , who is a cosponsor of Conyers 's Rainbow Lobby bill on free elections , when he came under attack in articles in the National Alliance newspaper for his position on Zaire aid , that he became aware of the lobby 's true identity . <p> Dymally contends that the lobby uses misidentification with Jackson 's Rainbow Coalition to gain access to Capitol Hill , as well as to recruit and raise money in black enclaves . In a letter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Rainbow Lobby has embarked on a campaign of viciously attacking CBC members who are not co-authors of the Dellums bill .... Many Members of Congress confuse the Rainbow Lobby with the Rainbow Coalition , and usually respond to their requests for meetings . This group seemingly plays on this ambiguity and has become a very divisive force by its impact on the Congress . They should , in my judgement , be declared persona non grata. " ( n1 ) <p> Many Hill aides admit that they do n't know who they are doing business with . Frazier tells me that he has had a longstanding relationship with the lobby , but did n't know about the New Alliance party connection until I told him . " I 've worked with them on Zaire and Haiti . That 's all I know . Maybe I should find out more about that party , " he says . Eric Schwartz , the aide who advises Solarz on Zaire , acknowledges having had contacts with the lobby , but hastens to point out that Solarz was a Mobutu opponent long before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says he was not aware of the New Alliance connection , and adds that he " can not check the bona fides of every group " with which he deals . Asked about the coincidence of Solarz 's April testimony before the Obey subcommittee and the appearance that day of the Rainbow Lobby , which did much to enhance the lobby 's credibility , Schwartz referred inquiries to the Obey subcommittee . There , Obey aide Mark Murray did not return telephone calls . For her part , the lobby 's Ross recounted : " Obey 's staff called us up , said they were doing this , and of course we were thrilled to be asked to participate . After all , we 've been trying to get them to come out publicly against Mobutu like this for three years . " Ross went on to say that the timing of a critical letter sent to <p> Mobutu from the co-chairmen of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus , Reps . Porter and Tom Lantos ( D-Cal. ) , the day before the Obey hearing , also was the lobby 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after first acknowledging having heard " vague rumors " about the lobby while working with them . <p> A second group in Congress seems to know all about the Rainbow Lobby , and proceeds to deal with them despite  --  or perhaps because of  --  their extremist politics and warped social theories . Both Dellums 's aide Bob Brauer and Steve Weissman , the staff director of Wolpe 's House Africa subcommittee , say they are aware of the lobby 's links to the New Alliance party and that this does not affect their working relationship . Weissman called the lobby a " significant and welcome counterweight " to the Zairean government 's lavishly funded lobbying campaign . This is not exactly a revelation , given their simpatico ideological agendas : Dellums is certainly no friend of democracy or Israel , and Weissman is described as " more Stalinist than any member of the Soviet Politburo " by a ranking striped-pants Africanist at the State Department. ( n2 ) According to a House Foreign Affairs Committee aide , Weissman has also used the research arm of Congress , the Congressional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positions on Zaire and has passed that information on to National Alliance newspaper reporter Richard Sokolow , who has been spotted photo-copying such documents in the Foreign Affairs committee office . The Solarz link is harder to figure . A photograph of Ross with a grinning Solarz prominently adorns her Washington office . <p> Ross herself professes to be amazed that most of her contacts on the Hill claim not to know much about her group . About Dymally 's demurral , Ross issued this written statement : " From the beginning of our work on Capitol Hill , our staff has personally delivered , to Mr. Dymally and to each member of the Congressional Black Caucus and other members of Congress with whom we have worked , the weekly edition of the National Alliance newspaper , which could leave no doubt about the nature of our political alliances , and our explicit political differences with the Rev. Jesse Jackson and the Rainbow Coalition . In light of this actual history , known to everyone , Dymally 's July 24 declaration of his ' confusion ' is either an insult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete mental disarray . " <p> But that is precisely the point : it is no longer possible to insult the intelligence of Congress . The level of dense ignorance and calculated indifference on which the Rainbow Lobby 's ( i.e. , the New Alliance party 's ) infiltration campaign counts is quite high in Congress 's corridors . Thus , the efforts of the party 's therapy cultists not only to advance their bizarre  --  demented , really  --  sociopolitical agenda at home , but to influence critical issues of U.S. foreign policy , continue to succeed . <p> The political damage the Rainbow Lobby is inflicting is not the most telling part of the story . No one can reasonably dispute that the New Alliance party and its various fronts are on their face evil institutions . It is almost as if Lyndon LaRouche or the Ku Klux Klan were having coffee klatsches and photo sessions with U.S. Iawmakers . Almost , but not quite . For the Rainbow Lobby 's singular success is not just a matter of a schizophrenic and decentralized Congress falling into the grip of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It stems in large part from such groups being given carte blanche to appropriate the slogans " openness , " " fairness , " " democracy " that now pass for " liberalism . " That so glaringly illiberal a group could be so casually accepted into the fold by ( mostly ) Democratic representatives and their aides is a measure of the confusion and decay that beset that ideology . <p> ( n1 ) For more information on the Lobby 's war of words with Dymally and its attacks on other members of the Congressional Black caucus who do n't toe the line , see the August 17 , 1990 , issue of Washington 's City Paper .
