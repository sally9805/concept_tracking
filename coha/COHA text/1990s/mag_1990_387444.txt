Section : The Gulf case , teleprompter-ready . The following is the text of an address not delivered on national television by President Bush : <p> Fellow citizens , you know that I have ordered nearly 400,000 men and women of the armed forces to duty in Saudi Arabia . They are your sons and daughters , husbands and wives , brothers and sisters . They are enduring heat and hardship . They miss their homes and families . They are uncertain about how long they will be away and about whether they may have to go into combat . <p> Here at home , many are uncertain about whether this entire undertaking is worthwhile . Their concerns deserve a thoughtful , serious answer from me . <p> I have no hesitation in assuring you that the United States , along with its allies and the United Nations , is embarked on a vital mission . That mission is not simply to keep Iraq 's dictator from dominating the Middle East and its oil supplies , or to protect the world from the barbarism he represents , important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extraordinary opportunity that the waning of the cold war has created  --  the opportunity to bring into being a decent , lawful , and peaceful new world order . <p> On August 2 , without provocation and after denying he would do so , Saddam Hussein ordered Iraqi forces to seize his small neighbor , Kuwait . To prevent further aggression , and in cooperation with the government of Saudi Arabia , I ordered deployment of a defensive ground , air , and naval force of 230,000 Americans . As a result , Iraqi military forces have been stopped at the Saudi border . But during the past four months , the Iraqis have committed every form of barbarity inside Kuwait , including rape , murder , the taking of hostages , and looting on an unprecedented scale . Saddam Hussein 's army has carted virtually everything of value from Kuwait back to Iraq . A father and mother begged an Iraqi soldier to let them take their two sick children into a hospital he was guarding . Instead , he shot the children , telling the parents he had cured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the country and is repopulating it with Iraqis . This is not simply an invasion or an occupation . It is the annihilation of a whole country . <p> Saddam Hussein 's acts violate every principle of international law and threaten every hope of building a stable , secure world order . Bolstering our military response with a diplomatic one , my administration and I personally have consulted with governments around the world . The United Nations Security Council has voted eleven times to condemn Iraq and to impose economic and military embargoes against it . Regardless of past differences and differing interests , the world community has spoken unanimously and forcefully that Saddam Hussein 's act of aggression can not stand  --  that he must get out of Kuwait , unconditionally and now . Almost without exception , the nations of the world have shut off their commerce with Iraq . Few products are getting in , and no Iraqi exports are leaving . Fifty-four nations have agreed to contribute economically or militarily to the joint action against Iraq . Twenty-six nations have sent troops or military matriel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ground , but we are joined by 38,000 troops from Saudi Arabia , 20,000 from Egypt , 9,500 from Britain , 5,000 from Syria , and 28,500 from other countries as far distant as Argentina and Australia . The United States is not acting as the world 's policeman . We are , if you will , like a sheriff organizing a posse in the name of law and order . We are acting , as we often have before , as the leader of the civilized world . <p> Why should so many nations stand as one , and risk the lives of their young men and women ? For oil ? ' it is sometimes asked . Well , yes , partly for oil  --  but not for the difference between gasoline at $1 a gallon or at $1.50 a gallon . No responsible leader would risk war for that  --  nor did any , when gas prices quadrupled in the 1970s . However , until adequate alternate sources of energy are developed , oil is the lifeblood of our economy and the world economy . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our power plants . Our jobs , our prosperity , the very heat in our homes , depend upon it . If allowed to keep Kuwait , Saddam Hussein will control a third of the world 's oil reserves . Think about it . Had he not been deterred from going into Saudi Arabia and the smaller Gulf states , he might have controlled fully half the world 's oil reserves . He could still do so , were our resolve to fail , were the United States to abandon the effort to resist him . He would then set the price for oil , perhaps doubling it or tripling it , forcing every country to pay him tribute and destroying the capacity of poor nations to grow , to educate their children , and to feed their populations . This would be the greatest act of theft the world had ever known . <p> Would he do such a thing ? I confess that I underestimated Saddam Hussein and the threat he posed . I thought that it was possible to develop cooperative relations with him . I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his methods and intentions . Now I know better . Saddam Hussein launched an eight-year war against his neighbor , Iran , over control of a waterway , causing a million deaths on both sides . He is the only ruler since World War I to have used poison gas on a large scale , and he has used it against his own citizens as well as enemy soldiers , killing thousands . He has used Iraq 's substantial oil wealth to build up a million-man army , to develop nuclear bombs , chemical and biological weapons , and missile delivery systems , and to finance terrorist groups . We believe he will possess a deliverable nuclear warhead within five years . If allowed to prevail in the current confrontation , Saddam Hussein would use his new oil income to become a malevolent new superpower  --  just when the world is thirsting for a chance , after a century of war and cold war , to enter a century of peace . <p> Millions upon millions of people have been killed in wars in this century  --  wars over territory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every human conflict anytime soon , but the end of the cold war brings us the opportunity to build a new world order based on law , democratic values , and international cooperation . It is unfortunate that the first test of this new world order should be a military confrontation . I pledge that the United States will undertake to broaden the areas of international cooperation . During the coming two years we will propose new international agreements , with inspection and enforcement mechanisms , to limit trade in conventional arms , prevent the spread of missile technology , and tighten existing controls on nuclear proliferation and chemical and biological weapons development . We will redouble our efforts to promote democratic development around the world , including among our Arab allies . We will seek to establish a new international election-monitoring organization available to nations desiring to demonstrate that they are in the process of building democracy . We seek a world order in which all nations can fulfill the potential of their citizens , and in which all nations bear their fair share of responsibility . <p> But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to retain the fruits of his aggression . Saddam Hussein 's aim is to dominate the Persian Gulf and the Middle East , to terrorize its people with weapons of mass destruction , and to topple governments that stand in his way , especially those friendly with the United States . If this dictator , this invader , this mass murderer is permitted to defeat the unanimous resolve of the civilized world , how will the world summon its resolve against any other aggressor ? Will any Middle Eastern country even consider democracy as a model if this brutal dictatorship is the most powerful regime in the region ? If the world can not cooperate to thwart a recognized evil , what endeavor can it cooperate upon ? <p> In the Gulf the world faces a crucial test of its destiny . Will it be one of solidarity , in which the peoples of the world join together to resist evil and promote our common good ? Or will it be one of barbarism and aggression , in which every ruthless dictator feels unconstrained from fulfilling his ambitions , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people either become cynical or watch in helpless despair ? <p> Ifervently hope that the building of a new world does not have to begin with war . I call upon Saddam Hussein tonight to withdraw unconditionally from Kuwait , to restore its previous government and to pledge adequate funds to rebuild Kuwait , even though he can not repair all of the damage he has done . I call upon him to agree to reduce his military arsenal to a level consistent with defense of his territory , and to submit his nuclear , chemical , and missile installations to international inspection . If he refuses  --  and he has refused every appeal up to now  --  then the world will have no honorable choice but to intensify pressure against him , including military pressure . It was for this purpose that I ordered an additional force of 150,000 Americans to the region on November 8 . The United States and its allies shortly will have in place sufficient air , ground , and naval forces to drive Iraq out of Kuwait and to destroy Iraq 's power to wage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the U.N . Security Council tomorrow an authorization for the use of such force as may be necessary to accomplish these ends . Once the U.N . has acted , I will call Congress into special session to enact an authorization to use American military forces , if necessary , to carry out the policy of the United Nations . If the disparate world community can stand united against ruthless aggression , I am confident that the United States government can as well . <p> I can not predict whether war will be necessary . I pledge that it will not be undertaken casually , that Americans will not fight alone , and that every effort will be made to limit allied casualties . But I can not rule out any military option ; if Saddam Hussein uses unconventional weapons , we will respond in kind . I can not guarantee that young American men and women will not die , along with British soldiers , Saudis , Egyptians , Kuwaitis , and Syrians . We pray that war will not become necessary . But as past generations of Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totalitarianism , so we will fight , if we must , for a world of order under law . God bless you and our forces in the field , and good night . <p> By Morton Kondracke <p>
