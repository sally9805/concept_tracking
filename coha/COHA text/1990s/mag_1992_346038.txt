NETWORK TV IS A NOTORIOUSLY TROUBLED business , with cable , VCRs and other rivals steadily wooing away viewers . But that does n't mean one of the Big Three ca n't still pop a champagne cork every spring . This year 's celebrator : CBS , first in prime-time ratings for the 1991-92 season . The network drew an average 13.8 rating for the 30-week period , comfortably ahead of NBC , at 12.3 , and ABC , at 12.2 . It was an especially satisfying victory for CBS , which has been in third place for the past four seasons ; no other network has jumped from worst to first in one year . <P> CBS was lifted by such hits as 60 Minutes ( TV 's No. 1-rated show ) , Murphy Brown and Designing Women and also got a big boost from blockbuster sports events like the Super Bowl , World Series and Winter Olympics . But the huge cost of acquiring TV rights to those events means that CBS , despite its victory , will lose money for the season . <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25% over last year . The Big Three had some unaccustomed good news as well : their combined share of the TV audience rose for the first time since 1976-77 , from 62% to 63% . Has the long-term erosion of network viewership finally bottomed out ? <P> CHART : NOT AVAILABLE <P> CREDIT : TIME Graphic by Steve Hart <P> TMFONT 1 d #666666 d Source : Nielsen Media ServicesCAPTION : Ratings Race
