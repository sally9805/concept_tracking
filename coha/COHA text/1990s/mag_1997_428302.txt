Section : couples As if you needed an excuse to have more sex , here are 10 reasons getting physical will improve your health , lower your stress and help you pay for the kids ' college educations <p> THE FOLLOWING SCENE happens millions of times a day , in homes from Moosehead Lake to San Mateo : <p> A man is about to bite into a beauty of a salami and cheese sandwich , when the woman in his life walks in and gives him a disapproving **32;573;TOOLONG glance . Sometimes , the fish-eye comes with a little cluck , as though she did n't really mean to make a sound , but her alarm at seeing her guy about to eat something so bad for him triggered an involuntary hiccup in her larynx . <p> Now , cynics might claim that a woman 's watchfulness stems from some perverse need to act like his mother when he already has a mother . We at Men 's Health deplore such skepticism . Rather , on behalf of the men of America , we file a request for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The plan we 're suggesting offers dozens of health benefits , from cholesterol control to prostate protection , from pain relief to stress reduction . <p> What is this unknown road to wellness ? <p> Sex . And lots of it . <p> Turns out that psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich was n't that far off back in the ' 40s when he recommended an orgasm a day for optimum health . Here are just a few of the reasons the truly devoted spouse does n't just snatch the hoagie from her husband 's hands , but offers him a medicinal kitchen quickie to boot . Burn Fat in Bed <p> " Sexual activity is a form of physical exercise , " says Michael Cirigliano , M.D. , an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine . True , each individual sex act is n't much exercise . But remember the lesson of the pyramids . Each brick is insignificant ; together they amount to a wonder of the world . <p> If you 're lucky enough to have sex three times a week  --  nothing fancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7,500 calories every year . That 's the equivalent of jogging 75 miles . And the calorie-burn count ascends with the amorous effort . If once a week you are a little more athletic , and once a month reenact The Tropic of Cancer , your sex life will burn close to 10,000 calories annually . That 's roughly the energy you 'd use 10-minute-miring it from the Empire State Building to Independence Hall . And remember , these are calories spent before you get anywhere near a rowing machine . <p> On top of its aerobic benefits , sex offers some  --  yes , a small amount , but some  --  of the benefits of resistance training " During arousal and orgasm there is myotonia , or contraction , of the muscles , " says Dr. Cirigliano . The more lifting , spinning and thrusting , the better , from a muscle-building point of view . No doubt , sex that involves bench-pressing your partner is a greater boon than a snuggle where nobody is cleaned and jerked . <p> But do n't go crazy . " As with any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injury where you want it least . " Live Lustier , live Longer <p> The French call the orgasm la petite mort : the little death . But researchers say a little death now and again can help postpone the big death that 's looming later on . <p> Love hates cholesterol . Sex , a form of exercise , helps lower your total cholesterol and tin the all-important good cholesterol/bad cholesterol ratio in the healthier HDL direction . Okay , not much . But maximum wellness is about little advantages , doing all you can . <p> Love is like oxygen . Sex kicks the respiratory system into overdrive . When you breathe fast and deep , your blood is enriched with oxygen , which nourishes all your organs and tissues . <p> It rallies your testosterone levels . " Any kind of physical exercise is going to increase testosterone , " says clinical psychologist Karen Donahey , Ph.D. , director of the Sex and Marital Therapy Program at Northwestern University Medical Center . Sex is no exception . The magic male nectar has many happy effects . It makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscles . Some physicians even believe that testosterone may keep our hearts healthy and our good cholesterol high . <p> Amour is the ultimate analgesic . There is lots of evidence that the endorphins released during sex are effective painkillers . " Arousal and orgasm can elevate pain threshold , " says Beverly Whipple , Ph.D. , an associate professor at the College of Nursing at Rutgers University and president-elect of the American Association of Sex Educators , Counselors and Therapists . " Sex can help relieve arthritic pain , whiplash pain and headache pain . " <p> Testosterone is a corticosteroid , and its elevation during sex often reduces the joint inflammation of arthritis . Research suggests that some arthritis sufferers have less pain for up to 6 hours after sex . Headaches can also be better managed with sex : The endorphins released during arousal have an analgesic effect . The accelerated blood flow throughout the body , specifically to the genital area , takes pressure off the brain . The relaxation that comes with orgasm reduces tension in the neck muscles . <p> Sex delivers DHEA . DHEA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . The snake-oil salesmen of wellness are pitching it as a miracle elixir , antidote to everything from impotence to bad taste in leisurewear . Though the early hype is premature , there is persuasive evidence that higher levels of DHEA are good for us . <p> " Just before orgasm and ejaculation , DHEA spikes to levels three to five times higher than usual , " says Theresa Crenshaw , M.D. , the author of The Alchemy of Love and Lust . According to Dr. Crenshaw , DHEA can improve cognition , ratchet up the immune system , inhibit tumor growth , promote bone growth and sometimes even function as an antidepressant . Pamper Your Prostate <p> Some prostate problems that become common once we reach our late 40s are caused and/or aggravated when the fluids in the prostate gland are n't emptied out efficiently . And what hoses out the prostate gland ? You got it . S-e-x . <p> During orgasm , the muscles around the prostate contract over and over , squeezing out the fluids . Though experts differ on exactly how frequent sex should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , others say several times  --  it 's clear that regular sex is a prostate plus . Further , if you currently have an active sex life , it 's important to keep up the good work . <p> " If a man is ejaculating on a fairly regular basis of one , two , three or more times weekly , " says Stephen N. Rous , M.D. , a professor of surgery at Dartmouth Medical School and author of The Prostate Book , " and then , for whatever reason , his frequency of orgasm and ejaculation decreases sharply , it is likely that the prostate gland will become overly full of fluid . " Which is a fancy way of saying that spouses should n't let silly arguments interfere with nooky . <p> One unfortunate note of caution : There seems to be some evidence that any sudden change in the frequency of sexual activity , including a shift from dry spell to orgy mode , may be bad for the prostate , too . So , if for some happy reason , things are picking up , resist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast as possible . Get Excited , then Calm Down <p> Question : What 's the single greatest cause of stress for men ? Financial trouble ? Fascist boss ? The recurring thought that David Hasselhoff could buy your house with the money in his couch cushions ? No , no and no . Answer : Not enough sex . There 's no formal research to back up this statement only because no self-respecting scientist wants to waste the grant money proving something every idiot already knows . <p> " Sex can be a very effective way of reducing stress levels , " says Donahey . <p> Having sex chills a guy out , suffuses him with a profound feeling of well-being and relaxation . A nooner does wonders for a man 's mood . There 's plenty of research to indicate that mood matters medically , that optimism is good for your health . And it 's much easier to be optimistic if there 's a good chance that at any moment your wife might pull you into the hall closet and give you a good going-over . Avoid Divorce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there 's science to support the idea that sex makes relationships more durable . Which means that you 're better able to weather the moguls that make even a great marriage bumpy from time to time . <p> The antidivorce drug may be a hormone called oxytocin , which is secreted by the pituitary gland . In one of nature 's feedback loops , it both generates our desire to be touched and is boosted by touch . Whenever anybody ( even a golfing buddy ) touches you affectionately , there 's a little extra zatz of oxytocin . When somebody touches you so affectionately that you have an orgasm ( probably not your golfing buddy ) , the level of oxytocin spikes dramatically . <p> According to Dr. Crenshaw , oxytocin is the " bonding hormone . " It makes us inclined to hug and cuddle , and may make us better lovers , parents or friends . Though oxytocin 's effect is more dramatic in women than in men ( probably because oxytocin works in conjunction with estrogen , which is much higher in women ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex life is more likely to be a loving husband and sweet Dad than a man who has to beg for carnal crumbs . Keep Your Wife in Working Order <p> The women of America should know that the health benefits of sex apply to them as well . Indeed , sex may be even more important for them than for us . " Regular lovemaking can increase a woman 's estrogen level , protect her heart and keep vaginal tissues more supple , " says Donahey . A steady sex life can also help regulate irregular menstrual periods and ameliorate premenstrual syndrome . <p> " There is increasing evidence , " says Dr. Crenshaw , " suggesting that sex may help you live longer . " Touch exerts its power throughout your system by raising the substances that lengthen your life span  --  DHEA , oxytocin , endorphins , growth hormone  --  and lowering those that can shorten it , like cortisol and adrenaline . <p> Consider this cascade of consequences : You have a terrific sex life . So you 're healthy and stress-free . So your performance at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thereby making more money , eventually living in a great house , driving great cars , taking swanky vacations and having the jack to send your son to Duke and your daughter to Yale . All because two people cared enough about each other and the kids to do it whenever they possibly could . <p> Now , if you can just figure out how to get your HMO to pay for it ... Learn to Speak Her Romance Language <p> If you 're tired of driving solo down life 's highway , start scouring the horizon for these sexual signposts <p> Okay , so you 've decided that sex is the best medicine . Now you just need someone to fill your prescription . <p> Fear not . All it takes to succeed in the art of seduction is a rudimentary understanding of the form . " Courtship is a process , not an event , " says Monica Moore , Ph . D. , an associate professor of psychology at St. Louis 's Webster University . Moore has been researching flirting and courtship since 1978 , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies in recognizing the subtle signals women send out when they 're attracted to you . Act on them and you 'll be the healthiest , happiest guy in town . Stage 1 : First contact <p> " Most people think it 's men who initiate flirting , " says Moore , " but two-thirds of the time women give off a signal of interest first . " <p> Through research , Moore has identified more than 50 " courtship signals " that women send out when they 're interested in a guy . Some are conscious signs , others are subtle indicators that even she does n't know she 's giving out . <p> Flashing her eyebrows . She raises her eyebrows for a second or two , then quickly lowers them . Often combined with a smile and eye contact . <p> Running her fingers through her hair . Some make only one hand movement , others stroke their hair . <p> Smiling coyly . A half-smile , often combined with a downward glance or brief eye contact . <p> Licking her lips . Could be a simple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Giving you short , darting glances . Usually occurs in bouts , with an average of three glances per bout . <p> Primping . She smoothes out her clothes , even though they 're already perfectly fine . <p> Swaying to the music . While seated , she moves her body to the beat . Get over there and ask her to dance , now . <p> Caressing an object . She runs her fingers over a glass , an ashtray , a set of keys or anything else that 's handy . <p> Hiking her skirt to expose her leg . Like , we have to explain this ? <p> If you 've made eye contact and have n't spotted one or more of these actions , it might be better to look elsewhere . " The biggest mistake guys make is setting their sights on a woman who has no interest in them , " says Moore . Stage 2 : Your move <p> If someone is sending you signals , approach her , but tread carefully . One flirtatious sign does not necessarily translate into a night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once she learns more information about you , " says Moore . To increase your chances , remember the following : <p> Do n't be a wiseass . " It 's not a good idea to use sarcasm or be mean-spirited , even in joking , " advises Moore . A woman 's sense of humor is different from a man 's . You may think you 're the next Howard Stern ; she 'll probably think you 're a creep . <p> Do n't say anything about her appearance . We know , you thought complimenting a woman on her eyes , hair or outfit was like money in the bank . Sorry , Moore says , it 's a little greasy . " That 's rushing things , and it can sound too much like a line . " <p> Instead , Moore suggests you simply introduce yourself and start talking about where the two of you are and what 's brought you there . " If you 're in an art museum , say something about a painting . If you 're at a party , talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal . " Stage 3 : Is she still interested ? <p> After you 've initiated conversation , a woman will usually send out a signal on how you 're doing . If you 're coming on too strong , or she just plain thinks you 're a doofus , it might be one of these : <p> Avoiding eye contact with you <p> Orienting her body away from you <p> Crossing her arms over her chest <p> Engaging in " private " grooming habits like picking her fingernails and looking at the ends of her hair . <p> If that happens , do n't panic-yet . Hang around long enough to see if you receive the bad vibes consistently . " Sometimes you 'll see a woman mixing rejection signals with courtship signals , " says Moore . " She 's not necessarily doing it to confuse the guy , she may be doing it to slow him down . The woman generally controls the pacing in a courtship . " <p> Then again , if you 're eliciting only rejection signals , take a hint and work your magic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> More positive signs to look for as the night goes on : <p> Her body posture is open <p> She exposes the palms of her hands as she talks to you <p> She illustrates her speech with hand and arm movements <p> She whispers <p> She gazes into your eyes <p> She brushes your forearm . " It may seem like an accident , but a lot of times it 's the woman 's way of letting you know physical contact is okay , " observes Moore . <p> Finally , if she 's interested , she might subject you to a couple of tests . <p> The teasing test . " This could be her way of measuring a guy 's sense of humor , " says Moore . She ribs you , you laugh it off . Got that ? <p> The damsel in distress test . " A woman might want to see how sensitive a guy is , " Moore theorizes , " so she might linger by a chair to see if he pulls it out , or pick up her sweater to see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to know if you can sense and respond to her needs . <p> What to do ? Pull out that chair and help her on with that sweater . And if you do all that and still strike out ? <p> That , friends , is why they call romance a " game .
