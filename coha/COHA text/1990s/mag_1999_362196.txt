In the parking lot of a usually staid Portuguese meeting hall in San Diego , Calif. , the Violent Femmes blare from a corner amp as the putt-putting of engines competes with the squealing of high-pitched horns . Many dozens of motor scooters in burgundies , grays and greens line the parking lot , displaying favored ornaments  --  a Tinky Winky doll hanging from one , a picture of Rocky and Bullwinkle 's Natasha from another .
