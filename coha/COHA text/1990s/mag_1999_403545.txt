// Inside a house built by the Mormon pioneers who settled the town of Tropic , Utah , I get my first good look at the newest national monument , ( Grand Staircase-Escalante . I am standing in a closet-sized room that could qualify Jeffrey Eaton 's house as at research station . On the wall is a remarkably clear satellite image of the monument 's 1.7 million acres on the northern edge of the Colorado Plateau . The terrain appears in various hues-mostly dull grays , olive drabs , and tans , I can see innumerable canyons , gulches , and washes cut into the rising rock by rivers and ephemeral streams . DEaton , a geologist at Weber state University in Ogden , Utah , points out the Grand Staircase , which , like the monument , is best seen from space . It is a series of geological steps formed by the region 's more resistant rock layers . Beginning at the northern rim of the Grand Canyon , they rise as a giant progression of cliffs across the monument and into Bryce Canyon National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are popularly called the Chocolate , Vermilion , White , Gray , and Pink Cliffs . In the image on Eaton 's wall , they are easier to discern in the western third of the monument . Because Eaton has a passion for unraveling the evolution of mammals during the millions of years before the dinosaurs disappeared , he is most interested in the middle third of the monument lands : the Kaiparowits Plateau , a section of strata more than a mile thick that represents 22 million years of earth 's history . These rocks , he says , hold the most complete record in our hemisphere ( and probably in the world ) of terrestrial vertebrate evolution during the Late Cretaceous-that is , toward the end of the dinosaurs ' reign . Almost nothing was known of the region 's ancient mammal life until Eaton , along with Richard Cifelli , a paleontologist at the University of Oklahoma , began collecting and studying the fossils there in 1983 . Eaton shows me the fossils he typically collects . Mostly teeth and fragments of bone , they are tiny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third of a small plastic vial . Dumped into a small tray , the remains of these microvertebrates , as the organisms are called , resemble irregular grains of dark brown sand . Even under the lens of a microscope , they are a confusing jumble of odd shapes , at least to the uninitiated . But Eaton assures me that it is not so difficult to identify vertebrate species if one compares their teeth with those of their living counterparts . For example , Mesozoic marsupial teeth , he says , are not much different from those one might see in a fresh opossum roadkill . What to me look like minute rhinoceros horns are , in fact , crocodile teeth ; a serrated triangular tooth belongs to a small dinosaur . Other objects with ridges and cusps are teeth representing three broad groups of mammals : multituberculates ( an early primitive group that became extinct about thirty million years after the dinosaurs ) , pouched marsupials , and placentals . Because the mammal species that Eaton studies were often shrew-sized and never larger than a house cat , fossils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely rare . Many are known only from their teeth , which are well preserved , thanks to their incredibly durable enamel . Eaton has seen dental deformities but never any decay . That , he adds , came with refined sugar . Photograph Weathered like the rocks rising above them , abandoned buildings , above , stand near the Paria River .

Each one was painstakingly separated from a large sediment sample that had been washed and sieved from an even larger bag of rocks . After identifying a promising site in a remote canyon , Eaton trucks out or , when access is limited , even backpacks out heavy loads of the scientific pay dirt . He also admits he once employed a local helicopter pilot to retrieve a sample from atop an isolated plateau . Clearly he enjoys the entire process . I ask Eaton about the regional geology , and he begins the lesson in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of old but still productive fruit trees planted by the Mormon pioneers . There on Highway 12 , about halfway between Bryce Canyon National Park and Tropic , a major regional fault-the Paunsaugunt-cuts the earth where the drab Cretaceous rocks have been pushed upward past the younger , vibrant red and pink Tertiary rocks . The latter date from geologically more recent times , when mammals dominated . Eaton then points in several directions to outcrops of the Dakota formation , the oldest Late Cretaceous formation he works with . Some 93 million years old , its sediments contain the first diverse marsupial fauna in the world . Although they now thrive only in Australia , marsupials originated in North America . The Dakota rocks also record the diversification of vertebrates following the appearance and rapid radiation of flowering plants . Eaton 's house sits on the next layer , the Tropic Shale , which harbors ammonoids , sharks , rays , and other marine fossils . It was once the bottom of the shallow , midcontinental Greenhorn Sea , which at its maximum expansion reached from Kansas westward almost to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polar ice caps to trap water . Consequently , global sea levels were some six hundred feet higher than they are today . The retreating shoreline of the inland sea lingered for millions of years in the vicinity of Tropic . The entire region was a vast basin that continued to fill with sediments from eroding mountains to the west . // We get into Eaton 's car and , skirting the monument lands , head northeast on Highway 12 toward the town of Escalante . As we pass through Cannonville and Henrieville , we dip down briefly into older , grayish Jurassic badlands distinguished by a few thin bands of red rock . Nearby are the brilliant-colored Jurassic rocks of Kodachrome Basin State Park . Eaton points out what is known in geology as an " unconformity " - in this case , more than a hundred million years of the Cretaceous record are missing , having been lost to erosion or perhaps never deposited here in the first place . Above the Jurassic strata , the record resumes abruptly with the darker , brownish rocks of the Late Cretaceous Dakota @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eaton describes the environments that each layer represents , ranging from shallow marine habitats to river deltas and coal-forming swamps . He rattles off a list of the vertebrates whose fossils he has found in each layer : a constantly changing mix of fishes , amphibians , reptiles , dinosaurs , and mammals . The Straight Cliffs formation is next . With thick accumulations of buff-colored , erosion-resistant sandstone , it buttresses the Kaiparowits Plateau and forms a precipice that extends fifty miles on its eastern border . The cliffs contain a unique record of vertebrates that once lived in near-shore and brackish-water habitats . Here also , Eaton investigates the changes in the vertebrate populations wrought by a global extinction preceding the more sweeping one at the end of the Cretaceous . Farther along the road , the Wahweap formation comes into view . From these sediments , Eaton has sifted fossils of early placental mammals . Then , at a spot called The Blues , he stops to show me the badlands carved into the Kaiparowits formation ( distinct from the plateau of the same name ) . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft , bluish gray earth . It is also Eaton 's richest source of microvertebrates and has produced dozens of previously unknown vertebrate species , particularly mammals . More specifically , it has yielded evidence of the diversification of placental mammals in North America . Above the Kaiparowits formation is another large gap in the geological record ; the rocks younger than 71 million years , representing the tail end of the Cretaceous , are missing-which is fine with Eaton . He is happy not to be drawn into the often contentious debate about what killed the dinosaurs . Our trip has taken us across only a very small corner of the monument . Farther to the northeast , Highway 12 descends into progressively older Jurassic and Triassic rocks , into which the upper drainage of the Escalante River is carved . This river , the last major waterway to be mapped in the West , dominates the eastern third of the monument . During the past sixteen years , Eaton has gotten to know well the lands encompassed by the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument . Geologists and paleontologists have long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in archaeological sites . Two Native American cultures , the Anasazi and the Fremont , came into contact on these lands . Here , too , biologists can study relatively pristine populations of the plants and animals of the Colorado Plateau ; the isolation of the region has , for the most part , guaranteed the integrity of its original flora and fauna . Designated a national monument in September 1996 , the public lands will continue to be administered by the Bureau of Land Management . Eaton hopes that little will change and that scientists will still get the access they need to conduct their research . He also hopes that the dirt roads within the monument remain as they are-often impassable in winter and after heavy rains-so that the region remains unspoiled . He is happy that the lack of spectacular red-rock canyons has kept interest in the area low and jokes that the drabness of the gray and tan rocks of the Kaiparowits Plateau even seems to repel some visitors . But for others-those who are inclined to venture out into the monument 's vast solitude-the beauty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cactus share a crevice .
