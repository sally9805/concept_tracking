Every minute spent in the wilds of caribou country is worth it // I watched in amazement as Gregg Severinson opened the tent flap a bit more for a better look at the hundreds of caribou that were streaming past . Big bulls trotted by just 50 yards from camp , and I knew sleep would n't come easy . Because Alaska law does n't allow you to hunt the same day you fly , we had to wait until morning . I was n't worried , though , because our trip in had revealed an incredible sight . Our pilots flew along a huge herd of 30,000 caribou . They were traveling in a long line , just a few miles from the Alaskan coast . The pilots put the planes down in a small , dry lake bed . We 'd camp near the head of the herd . It would take days for the animals to file past , and unless something unexpected happened , this was as close to a guaranteed hunt as any I 'd ever been on . Gregg is manager of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retail and catalog store that arranges hunts around the world ( 800-346-8747 ) . The two of us had hunted together many times in the past . Gregg is a skilled outdoorsman and one of the best hunters I know-the kind of guy I like to make a drop-camp with . A Perfect Hunt Our Alaska camp had just the bare essentials , and when the pilots left us in their small Super Cubs , we were on our own . It would be a test of survival if the weather turned bad . I 'd been in this area in the past and knew how quickly a storm could brew . As it turned out , my worries were unfounded because the sun shone brightly and it was calm the next morning . Gregg and I had our caribou down before noon , but not until we saw hundreds of bulls . Mine was a dandy , with long , massive beams and plenty of tines , but Gregg 's was a really good bull . So good , in fact , that he flew the antlers out whole so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book . ( We later learned that Gregg 's bull just missed the book . ) I cut mine in half so they 'd stow more easily in the bush plane , a common practice in the North Country . ( Splitting the antlers disqualifies them for entry in B &C.); That hunt had been perfect : The weather cooperated , and we were camped near a massive migration . It was a storybook hunt , and other than packing meat to camp on backpacks , it was n't much of a physical effort . My bull fell about 400 yards away ; Gregg 's was about twice that distance . Caribou Quirks Caribou are unique animals , unlike anything else I 've ever hunted in North America . They typically gather in big herds , migrate long distances and live in the most remote country on the continent . Of all the caribou I 've hunted , which includes four of the North American subspecies , all required an airplane flight into the backcountry . In addition , I 've used horses , boats and canoes to reach herds once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique aspect of caribou is their wariness , or lack thereof . Any time someone tells me a caribou displayed a sense of intelligence toward humans , I have to wonder . Jack O'Connor , OUTDOOR LIFE 's late Shooting Editor , referred to caribou as being somewhat stupid . " If they run away , " O'Connor liked to say , " they usually forget what spooked them and run back for a closer look . " I 've seen them behave the same way on several of my hunts . A few years ago , while I was hunting Dall sheep in Alaska , a bull caribou approached our horses as we rode up a riverbed . Photograph When field-judging trophy caribou , look for big tops first , with lots of points and heavy palmation . If a bull is big on top , chances are he 'll score well elsewhere . // The animal took one look at us , bolted and ran off smartly . Less than a minute later , the bull returned , ran up within 50 yards and stared at us as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at ease with our presence . Unfortunately , none of us had a caribou tag or it would have been a nobrainer hunt . When hunting mountain caribou in British Columbia , our party rode horseback onto a snowy plateau . We spotted two herds of caribou , and I flipped a coin with another hunter in our group to decide which herd we 'd pursue . One had a huge bull , and , as luck would have it , the other hunter won the coin toss . Reggie Collingwood , my outfitter , and I rode close to the other herd . When we were 400 yards away they seemed to be getting nervous . Following Reggie 's suggestion , we dismounted and walked toward the animals , leading our horses by their halters so we were just barely in front of the horses . The caribou calmed down and watched placidly as we came to within 150 yards , whereupon I lay prone in the snow , drew a bead on the bull and dropped him where he stood . Evidently the caribou were not at all concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our animals we represented no danger . The other hunter , by the way , shot his bull easily and it scored high in the record book . A believable theory has it that caribou are trusting because their remote habitat isolates them from humans . A person standing upright has no resemblance to the wolf , their primary predator , and most caribou never see a human during their entire lives . The Real Challenge In my estimation , the biggest challenge in caribou hunting is simply getting to hunting camp . I recall one trip where we had to take canoes 80 miles along the Arctic Ocean to reach caribou herds . Former OUTDOOR LIFE editor Vin Sparano and I made that trip , and once or twice I had doubts that we 'd get out of there unscathed . We were guided by an Inuit who spoke broken English , and somehow we managed to get to the hunting area , though stormy seas forced us to take refuge on small rocky atolls . When we reached camp , half of the 18 hunters in our party quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their bulls within 200 yards of the beach . The rest of us waited , and within three days all of us had our bulls . None of those animals showed alarm at our presence . Playing the Odds Though there are plenty of " easy " hunt stories , there are nightmare hunts as well , and I 'm not referring to weatherrelated problems only . Many caribou hunts are geared to migrations , and those are the ones most hunters complain about , if they indeed have complaints . Sometimes the migrations are n't timed with the hunters ' presence , which means the hunt will be a bust , pure and simple . It does n't matter , how good a hunter you are , or how physically tough you are-if there is n't a living caribou within 50 miles of camp , you might as well fish or pop a ptarmigan or two . It happens every year , in dozens of camps in the North Country , even to reputable outfitters who have great track records . Drop-camp hunts like the one Gregg and I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are and will set you down close by . In other parts of Alaska and across Canada , there are resident herds that provide hunting all fall in the same general areas . Hunting migrating animals can be a big gamble , as many disappointed hunters can attest to . When you plan your caribou hunt , think adventure . The Far North has a special mystique , and you 'll feel woefully inadequate when you enter this enormous , desolate landscape . Even though caribou might seem a bit lacking in the brain department , I 'm betting you 'll love every minute in their fascinating world . <p>
