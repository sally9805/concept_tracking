There 's a predator stalking the plains <P> Who removes any reasonable doubt <P> That the government is bound and determined <P> To drive every cattleman out . <P>  --  Baxter Black , cowboy poet <P> Western ranchers came streaming into Washington last week , string ties hoisted , hats as wide as the plains , boots gleaming . But they were jumpy and angry . And in the shadowy halls of the Capitol and the Interior and Agriculture Departments , they listened and argued about Bill Clinton 's proposal to raise prices on government land and resources . <P> Wright Dickinson , 32 , fourth-generation cattleman , lean as a post , had one troubled eye on the weather reports of storms tumbling over his family 's land along the Green River in Wyoming and Colorado , the other on news accounts of plans to raise the $1.86 grazing fee ( a cow and her calf for a month ) to $3 or maybe $5 or even $10 . Away from the floodlit Capitol dome , he said quietly , " We are standing on the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can find some basis for a rational discussion , we could lose it all . " He held out hope that Clinton could adopt a discount rate for the smaller ranchers . <P> Sheep rancher Nick Theos , all of his 72 years in the rugged rangeland of Colorado and Utah written on his face , was not as restrained . " If that fee goes up to $2 or $3 we are broke , out of business , " he said with the sweep of a giant , scarred hand . By the weekend , Theos was back out in his sheep camps and Dickinson was in a wind chill near zero with his two sisters , brother and parents , all getting ready for the new calves that will begin arriving in a couple of weeks . " That 's one of the problems , " he said . " We 've got to be here , and our future is being debated there .

It is particularly poignant with the family ranchers , not the King Ranch of almost 1 million oil- rich Texas acres or the Mormon church 's Deseret Ranch in Florida , which runs 34,000 head of cattle . The big combines will survive . But the little guys are in jeopardy , a thin denim line of about 250,000 from the Canadian border to the Gulf of Mexico , leasing in varying amounts about 280 million acres of mountain and high desert range from the U.S. government . <P> Like the family farms before them , and small towns and their merchants , this group is caught in political and economic and social upheaval and threatened with extinction . " They are under siege , " claims Kathleen Jo Ryan , photographer and producer of the book Ranching Traditions , a spectacular look at the haunting beauty and challenges of range life . " They are an endangered species , " she says . These ranchers , she insists , not only supply a vital link of the food chain but also carry with them the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history . They are the fragile fabric of Western society that occupies the vast spaces and holds them together . " Reluctant heroes , " Ryan calls them , a breed that stayed and endured rather than running off to the promises of suburbia.
