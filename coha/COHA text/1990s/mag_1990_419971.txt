GLOBAL WARMING Are they big enough ? Fast enough ? The fight over fuel-efficient cars is being driven to new heights . <p> The time is past when horsepower was status , and only wimps and four-cylinder snits worried about gas mileage and other irrelevancies , " maintains Brock Yates , automobile critic for the Washington Post Magazine . An unreconstructed car-lover , Yates is by no means an apologist for people who consider cars to be rolling environmental disasters , but to him the trend is clear : " Efficiency is the byword of the future . " <p> Still , many car owners refuse to consider driving anything but overpowered , overweight machines . And that stubbornness , environmentalists say , poses a threat beyond oil shortages and smoggy cities . As climatologist Stephen H. Schneider points out , virtually all scientists in his field agree that carbon dioxide , principally from fossil fuel combustion , is gathering in the atmosphere , trapping more and more of the sun 's heat . The likely result of this accumulation is a gradual warming that could lead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schneider that more fuel-efficient cars would help slow the rate of global warming and minimize its effects . And according to Dan Becker , director of the Sierra Club Global Warming and Energy Program , the United States should be the first nation to enforce fuel efficiency , since it ranks as the world 's largest producer of carbon dioxide . Every gallon of gas burned spews about 19 pounds of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere , Becker says . For that reason , he and the Sierra Club believe that the most effective single action Congress could take right now to curb global warming would be to enact a 45-mile-per-gallon standard for new car fleets . <p> According to Becker , Detroit can meet a 45-mpg standard by using mostly " off-the-shelf " technology . He notes that aerodynamic designs , front-wheel drive , and engine and transmission changes are among the options available for producing fuel-efficient vehicles . <p> In a major step toward fuel savings and carbon-dioxide-emission reductions , Senator Richard Bryan ( DNev. ) , chair of the Consumer Subcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee , last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel efficiency for all new cars made in the United States during the next decade . The bill ( S. 1224 ) is expected to come to a vote later this year . If it passes , new cars would have to average 40 mpg by the year 2000 . <p> But in January , the Big Three automakers  --  Ford , Chrysler , and General Motors  --  began a campaign against Bryan 's proposal . The three hired FMR Group Inc. , a consulting firm in Washington , D.C. , to organize grassroots opposition to Bryan 's bill . <p> In early February , citizens in Bryan 's home state began receiving letters from a group calling itself Nevadans for Fair Fuel Economy Standards ( NFFES ) . Proposed efficiency increases , said the letter , " will have the direct effect of limiting automobile and truck choices , and may have a negative impact on safety . " Recipients of the letter , which bore the names of several Nevadans , had no way of knowing that the apparently homegrown association had been conceived , organized , and funded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew it , either . When contacted by the Detroit Free Press , some said they were unaware that the automakers had set up the organization . <p> Outraged by what he considered an attempt to distort the issues , Bryan fired off letters of his own to the automakers . " Your firm came into my community under a false flag , " he informed Chrysler president Robert A. Lutz . Not only was the NFFES letter " highly biased " in its assessment of the costs of new fuel-efficiency controls , Bryan told Lutz , it " did not explore the greater costs to the public " of the alternative : " deteriorating environmental quality and our increasing dependence on foreign oil . " <p> The technologies for producing fuel-efficient cars and small trucks without sacrificing safety , performance , comfort , low emissions levels , or affordability already exist , according to Deborah L. Bleviss , executive director of the International Institute for Energy Conservation . In an article published in the November/December 1988 Technology Review Bleviss noted that Volvo has produced a prototype that gets 81 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seats four people , and withstands crashes better than U. S. law requires . <p> Nonetheless , the automakers persist in arguing that mandating fuel efficiency means making smaller cars . " The only way to reduce a car 's fuel consumption is to reduce its weight , " says Bill Noak , a spokesman for General Motors . " Customers point to fuel economy relatively far down on their list as a motive for buying . Their priorities are comfort , luggage room , and space . " That would lead drivers to keep their older , larger cars or switch to small trucks , he maintains . The Sierra Club 's Becker counters that Detroit 's own advertising campaigns , which seldom emphasize fuel efficiency , are driving the market toward gas guzzlers . <p> Becker also believes that the Motor City is hiding behind a smokescreen . Automakers , he says , are conveniently ignoring or discounting a recent Energy Department report , which concluded that the industry could meet a 40-mile-per-gallon standard while producing cars of the same size and class mix as existed in 1987 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong in part because oil is plentiful and cheap . " Currently OPEC is pumping more than 24 million barrels a day , " The Economist reported in April , " 2 million more than a world glutted with stored oil can absorb . " By mid-April the price of a barrel had tumbled to $16 from January 's $22 peak . Last year , the magazine noted , the world discovered five and a half times as much oil as it consumed . <p> Low oil prices also encourage U.S. dependence on foreign oil and discourage energy conservation . But as Becker points out , " Getting more miles out of a gallon of gas means lessening our reliance on oil imports , lowering levels of urban pollution , reducing pressure to drill in sensitive environments , and lowering costs to consumers . Increasing fuel efficiency is like finding a new source of oil under Detroit .
