It 's final ! " Bernadine yelled through the phone to Savannah . <p> " What ? " <p> " My divorce . " <p> " Wait a minute . I thought you said you had to go to court again about the settlement . " <p> " I still do , but John 's lawyer asked for this bifurcation hearing , which meant we could get the divorce before we reached a settlement . I 'm so happy I could shit . " <p> " I 've never heard of this before . " <p> " Me neither , but I 'm glad this part 's over . Anyway , can you meet me for a drink , dinner , something ? I need to celebrate . I 'm a free woman , girl ! " <p> " I wish I could , Bernie , but my friend Kenneth just flew into town . " <p> " He 's back again ? " <p> " Yeah . He surprised me . He claims he 's out here looking at new optometry equipment . " <p> " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Why ? " <p> " Because Kenneth 's married , that 's why . " <p> " So what ? " <p> " So , I ca n't afford to get involved with somebody who 's married . " <p> " Did n't he say he wanted to get a divorce ? " <p> " Yeah , but he 's not divorced . If anything I 'll do the same thing you did with Herbert . Sleep with him and send him back home to his wife . " <p> " Well , I still have to celebrate . I want to start spending my settlement money . I ca n't sit in this house , that 's for damn sure . " <p> " I 'm sorry I ca n't hang out with you . But I 'll take your behind out for a real celebration after Kenneth leaves . " <p> " Bye , girl . I 'm gone . " <p> After she hung up , Bernadine called Robin , who was n't home . Bernadine was glad . She called Gloria for the hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a Black Women on the Move board meeting and would n't be back until after nine . It was six forty-five . Bernadine had to go . Now . But where should I go ? she wondered . Most of the nice places she and John used to go to were out of business , which was typical in Phoenix . As soon as a nice place opened where Black folks could go to socialize , it lasted a few months , then something happened , and it 'd close . Another establishment would pop up in its place , and before long the same thing would happen . But Bernadine did n't care if she saw a Black face tonight or not . She was going somewhere . <p> She took a shower , put on some makeup , and threw on a pink blouse with a blue silk slack suit . But when she looked at herself in the mirror , she thought she looked boring , so she took it off and went through her closet like a maniac looking for something a little more lively . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neckline . This was perfect . <p> But she still did n't know where to go . She drove down Camelback until she came to Twenty-fourth Street . When she saw the Ritz Carlton , a European-style hotel that looked pink because of the lights shining on it , she pulled in . <p> " Are you a guest ? " the parking attendant asked her . <p> " I 'll know in a minute , " she said , getting out of the car . <p> " I 'm sure we have rooms available , " he said . " This is our slowest season . " <p> The next thing Bernadine knew , she was standing in a Superior Suite on the seventh floor overlooking the whole city . The room was full of antiques . The drapes , bedspread and sheets were all different shades of blue , and each a different kind of print . It was beautiful . This is more like it , she thought . Bernadine took the little key and opened the honor bar . It was full of goodies , including little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go downstairs to the bar and have a drink instead . It was still early , and now that she was here , she did n't want to sit in this hotel room by herself . <p> She found an empty seat at the bar , a very dark , ornate room , where a pianist was playing some kind of classical music , which Bernadine really was n't in the mood for . But she was here , so she listened to it . She ordered a strawberry daiquiri and looked around the room . Nothing but white folks . " Is anybody sitting here ? " When she turned around , Bernadine was surprised to see a tall , good-looking Black man about her age , in a black suit , standing behind her . <p> " No , nobody 's sitting there , " she said . She was embarrassed because she was sitting by herself at a bar . Bernadine did n't want him or anybody else to think this was what she usually did . She also hoped he would n't start talking to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a line or having a phony conversation with a stranger  --  she did n't care how good he looked . She was trying to get used to the idea that she was n't married anymore . Which would take much longer than tonight . <p> " My name 's James Wheeler . How 're you doing tonight ? ' <p> " Fine . Just fine , thank you . " <p> " Do you have a name ? " <p> " Bernadine Harris , " she said and tried not to take her eyes off her drink . He held his hand out to shake hers , so she held hers out , too . When he squeezed hers and shook , his hand was not only strong , but hot . The heat from his hand passed directly into hers . Bernadine was positive she felt some kind of current run from her palm to her arm , straight to her head , and then it permeated her whole body . What 's going on here ? she wondered . This had never happened to her before . She let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soothing . It was he . <p> " So where you from ? " he asked . <p> " Who , me ? " <p> He smiled at her . Bernadine noticed he was wearing a wedding band on his left hand , which made her relax . He was so well-groomed , she figured he had to be a lawyer , or maybe even a model or something . <p> " I live in Scottsdale , " she said . <p> " And you 're staying here at this hotel ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " So it 's like that , " he said and took his right hand and ran it over his hair . <p> " Like what ? " <p> " If I 'm being fresh , I apologize , " he said . <p> " It 's okay , " she said and took another sip from her drink . Bernadine did n't know what to do or say next . It was obvious that he was going to keep talking and since her drink was half-full , she could n't very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foolish . And for some stupid reason , now she felt like talking . " I just went through a divorce , and today it 's final and I 'm celebrating , " she blurted out . <p> " Well , congratulations , " he said . " If congratulations are in order . " <p> " They 're definitely in order . " <p> " How long were you married ? " <p> " Eleven years . " <p> " Whew , " he said and took a sip of his beer . <p> " What about you ? " she said . <p> " Five . " <p> " Happily ? " <p> " At one time , " he said . <p> " Where do you live ? " she asked . <p> " In Virginia , right outside D.C. " <p> " What brings you to Phoenix ? " <p> " Well , I had to come out here to get some background on a case I 'm working on . I 'm a civil-rights attorney . " <p> " So how long have you been here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe how nosy she was being . She blamed it on the daiquiri . <p> " For four days now . I leave tomorrow . " <p> " Have you had a chance to see the city ? " <p> " You mean town , do n't you ? " he said , grinning . <p> He had the most incredible smile . Sexy , when she got right down to it . And that moustache  --  boy was it shiny , even in this dim light . And those bushy eyebrows , and those luscious lips , and the way he moved , like his bones were lubricated or something . Bernadine was positive the booze was responsible for these impressions , these sensations she was having . She 'd never felt so aroused by a complete stranger before , and now that she was aware of it , she was starting to feel a little uncomfortable . She could n't remember feeling these kinds of sparks when she met John . Or any man . " You 're right , " she said , trying to keep her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on him . " Even though there 're more than a million people here , it really is just a big town . " <p> " I 've seen enough to know that I would n't want to live here . It 's too hot , for one thing , and what 's there to do in Phoenix , Arizona ? " <p> " Nothing . " <p> " I have to admit , " he said , " you 're the most stunning thing I 've seen in the four days I 've been here . " <p> " Thank you , " she said . Bernadine 's face felt flushed , and she knew if she were white , she 'd be red . <p> " So , is this the extent of your celebration ? " he asked her . <p> " It looks like it . " <p> " You 're not celebrating alone , are you ? " <p> " Well , you 're sitting next to me now , " she said and wanted to bite her tongue for saying it . Was this flirting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of herself ? <p> " You 're right , " he said . " I hope you do n't mind . " <p> " So far I do n't . " <p> He started laughing and asked if she 'd like to sit at a table , where he could see her face when they talked . Bernadine got up and left her drink at the bar . <p> " Would you like another one ? " he asked . <p> " I think I 've had enough . Maybe a club soda , " she said , " with a twist . " <p> James ordered one for himself and brought them back to the table . Over the next three hours , they learned more about each other than some people who 've known each other for years . Bernadine did n't know what to do with this information  --  how to process it  --  now that she had it . It turned out that James was 37 years old , and his wife , who was white ( which did n't even bother her tonight , for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare form of breast cancer . She 'd been hospitalized at least six times this past year . As Bernadine listened to him , she could tell he was n't making this up . This was n't the kind of story you made up . He did n't have any kids , but said he 'd always wanted some . His wife did n't , which was a major cause of their problems . Three years ago she noticed a big bruise on her left breast . James said she told him she had n't bumped into anything that she knew of . When they had it checked out , they discovered it was the kind of breast cancer that even a mastectomy would n't help . <p> Bernadine was scared to light her cigarette . James told her that he and his wife had been planning to divorce before they found this out , but he could n't leave her like this . They had a respirator at home , and for the last year she 'd literally been living on morphine . Now they were just waiting for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her suffer like this was the worst thing he 'd ever been through in his life . <p> Bernadine told him her whole history with John , his leaving her for his young white assistant , their messy divorce . James said she was brave . The way she was going forward with her life , raising two kids by herself and working full-time . Even the way she came into this bar alone tonight to celebrate . He said he saw her when she checked in and confessed that he hoped she was n't meeting here . He said he had his fingers crossed that she would come back down to the bar for a drink . And here she was . <p> He also said John was a damn fool , like so many men are . " We take entirely too much for granted , " he said , " when we should n't . We abuse what we should be doing our damnedest to protect . We hurt the people who love us and then wonder why our lives are so screwed up . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bernadine agreed with just about everything he 'd said during these three hours . As they talked , James had become even more enchanting Bernadine wondered how men did that . How they could say the right things at the right time and just look better , become so much more alluring . How they could move a certain way , look at you a certain way , and make you yearn for them . James had done that and more . She could n't remember the last time she actually sat down and talked to a man who had an opinion about so many things . She could 've sat there and listened to him all night . <p> " May I help you celebrate your new freedom ? " he was saying . He was holding Bernadine 's hands , which by now she felt perfectly comfortable with . <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> " Let me ask you this first . Have n't you ever wanted to do something like this ? " <p> " Something like what ? " <p> " Meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't waste time pretending because you just want to be with that person , you want to feel that person so bad that it 's more like a need , so you go for it and do n't worry about what 'll happen afterward ? " <p> Damn , Bernadine thought . It sure sounded good . " Well , " she said , " I 've been married for so long I never thought about it . " <p> " Let me be your comfort zone tonight , " he said and looked her in the eye . This man was serious . <p> " Well , it 's been comforting just talking to you , " she said . " But to tell the truth , I 'm game . " She got jittery right after she said it . <p> James got up from the table and helped Bernadine out of her chair . He went over to sign for the drinks , turned around and looked her in the eye again . Lord have mercy , Bernadine thought , while she watched every move he made . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She could n't wait to get inside them . When James put his arm over her shoulders , she felt that same current pass through her body all over again . <p> They caught the elevator to her floor . Bernadine could hardly get the key in the door . James could tell she was nervous , so he reached over her head and took the key from her . " It 's okay , " he said . " Relax . Let me do this . " She could feel his chest against her back . She wanted to fall just so he could catch her . Instead , Bernadine stood stock-still . When the door opened , the cool air flooded the room and hit them in the face . She set her purse on the bed and walked over to the picture window . Now that he was here she did n't know what to do . She was scared to get too close to him too soon . But James followed her . They both looked out at the view of the city , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good dreams before , but nothing came close to this . <p> " You feeling okay ? " he asked . <p> " Nervous . " <p> " I know , " he said . " It 's pretty obvious you 've never done anything like this before . " <p> " You 're right , " she said . <p> " I like that , " he said . " Having second thoughts ? " <p> " I 'm having all kinds of thoughts , " Bernadine said . <p> " Well , if it 's any consolation , I 've never done this before either . " <p> " I bet , " she said . <p> " I do n't lie , " he said . " Lies are just a temporary solution to a permanent problem , and they always come back to haunt you . " He bent down and kissed Bernadine on her head , her cheeks and then her bare shoulders . She felt them drop . " I know it sounds corny , but I feel like I 've known you all my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips . " You want to know something else ? " <p> " What ? " Bernadine said , but she could barely hear him . He tasted so good . <p> " I have n't slept with a woman in six months . " <p> Bernadine heard that . " Now this I do n't believe , " she said . <p> " It 's true , " he said . <p> " Why have n't you ? " <p> He just looked at her . " Tonight I want to make you feel like the most beautiful woman in the world , " he said and kissed her again . <p> Bernadine looked into his eyes and smiled . It sounded good , so good , that she took a deep breath , looked at this man standing in front of her and dropped her guard . After all , she was n't married anymore . She had protection in her purse . And she was a grown woman . Free to do whatever she wanted to do . Was n't she ? Had n't her heart given her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it changing its mind in mid-stream ? Because now it was telling her that she should n't be here . That what she was doing was low and sleazy and the kind of thing she should 've gotten out of her system in her twenties , not her thirties . And even though she 'd had that fling with Herbert , that was superficial compared with this . She and Herbert never talked , they just had sex . Bernadine was starving for real affection , for real tenderness , and needed a real man to give it to her . She wanted James to hold her . She wanted him to tell her over and over again that she was beautiful . Until she believed it . She wanted him to tell her that everything would work out , that her life would be okay . But she wanted it to be the truth . <p> James said it 'd been ten years since he 'd held and kissed a Black woman . It 'd been ten years since he 'd been able to talk to a woman without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . He put his arms around Bernadine and held her so close for so long that Bernadine started crying . James told her to go ahead and cry . And she did . And it felt good . <p> They stood there , in front of that big window like that until they felt strong enough to give each other another kind of comfort . And by six o'clock the next morning , James Wheeler and Bernadine Harris were in love . They both knew , they said , that this kind of comfort was a temporary thing . James thanked Bernadine for easing his pain . Thanked her for trusting him . And thanked her for her honesty . He thanked her for everything but especially , he said as he got in the taxi , for restoring his faith in Black women . <p> Bernadine checked out of the hotel , got in her Cherokee and drove home . When she got inside the house , she sat down on the couch and out of habit reached for a cigarette . But she did n't have the desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She sat there smiling , replaying last night in her head for hours . It did n't matter if she never saw him again . It did n't matter at all . She was alive again . <p> Terry McMillan is the author of the bestselling novel Disappearing Acts and the editor of the anthology Breaking Ice . <p>
