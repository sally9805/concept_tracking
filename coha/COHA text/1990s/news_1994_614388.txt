<p> Dominique Dawes is just 5-feet tall and weighs 96 pounds , but she 's a big talent who 's proving there 's more to America 's Olympic medal chances wo n't all be on Miller time . <p> The bed-trampolining and the stair-vaulting had grown flamboyant enough that the Dawes household was relieved to discover a YMCA nearby offered tumbling classes . Young Dominique Dawes , then 6 and the acrobatic middle child of three , was summarily enrolled , which is where this story might have ended had not the YMCA called back to say no one else was interested in tumbling so the class was canceled . <p> Grasping for alternatives , someone brought up the new little gymnastics school that had opened one town over in the Maryland suburbs of Washington , D.C. <p> " I think it was just because it was next to the shopping mall that we used to go to , " Dawes said . <p> Whatever , so it was that one day she walked into Kelli Hill 's gymnastics parlor in Wheaton , Md. , setting into motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transformed Dawes into the hottest gymnastics commodity in America , if not the world . Within the first two months , Hill had designated Dawes for advanced training . By age 12 , she had progressed to top-flight national competition . By 14 , she had made the U.S. Senior Women 's team . By 15 , she was an Olympian . And two months ago in Nashville came the critical step : a clean sweep of five events at the U.S. National Championships . <p> " Well , when I got back home , there was a lot more media , " she said . " But there 's usually media after a big competition like that . Other than that , my life has been the same . " <p> Yet not completely the same . At the World Team Championships in Dortmund , Germany , Nov. 15-20 , the U.S. squad will no longer seem an extension of Shannon Miller , the most decorated American gymnast in history . " I guess it makes it a little harder , for everyone is looking at me , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on myself . " <p> The perfect gymnast 's figure <p> Four months graduated from Gaithersburg ( Md . ) High School , Dawes could not represent the American athletic ideal any better if the U.S. Olympic Committee sketched her itself . An honor-roll student who has agreed to accept a scholarship from Stanford , Dawes has overcome a broken home ( parents Loretta and Don Dawes are divorced ) and a 40-hours-a-week practice schedule , once moving in with Hill when the commuting time to the gym caused too big a hardship on her mother . <p> " Was my childhood normal ? " she asked . " I do n't know . The only childhood I can remember was spent in a gym , so I guess I 'm not really in a position to know what normal is . <p> " Has it hurt me ? I do n't think so . That 's the thing you 've got to understand . This is what I like . This is what I enjoy . So , no , it never bothered me that I was spending all my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> On the floor , she cuts the perfect gymnast 's figure , 5 feet and 96 pounds , sleek but powerful . She walks rigidly from one apparatus to the next , her shoulders motionless until it is time to perform , when her ability to levitate brings the crowd alive . <p> Her customized " up-and-back pass " which opens her floor exercise , is a seamless composite of flips , hand springs , double somersaults and round- offs that taking her to the far corner of the mat and back again . No one on earth can duplicate it . <p> Dawes ' development , teamed with Miller 's consistency , has made the U.S. team , which took third in the 1992 Barcelona Games , seem destined for higher things in Atlanta . <p> Yet Dawes has remained coy about her future . She commits only to one year at a time , a device that she says makes her endless practice regimen endurable . Upon committing to Stanford , she left open the question whether she would enroll next year or defer to train for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . <p> " The whole goal was always just to make Barcelona and then college and then we 'd decide from there , " said Hill , who has seen her business blossom to include two gyms and 1,500 students . " We 've had a little change in focus since the nationals but she 's still progressing and her body has stayed young and she is very strong . And she 's still enjoying herself . " <p> She deserves to , for Dawes has arrived at a propitious time . Ever since they were 13 , Dawes and Miller ( who is three months younger ) were regarded as the future of the country 's Olympic hopes , and only now has Dawes found the spotlight . In Barcelona , Dawes , suffering from tendinitis in her ankles , was an auxiliary player while Miller overtook Kim Zmeskal as the nation 's foremost performer . <p> Last year at the World Championships in England , Dawes won silver medals in the bars and beam and just missed a third medal in the all- around . But Miller upstaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. championships with three golds and a silver . <p> When Miller followed up with all-around and beam gold medals in this spring 's World Championships in Australia , it could be assumed Dawes ( and everyone else ) would ever remain a handmaiden during Miller 's unprecedented reign . <p> The order was toppled in Nashville , where Dawes became the first performer since Joyce Tanac Schroeder in the 1969 AAU championships to win all five national titles . It should be noted Miller had already completed a rigorous spring and summer schedule , having returned from the Goodwill Games in Russia only three weeks before . She led during the compulsory round , but on a dismount from the beam in her optional routine , Miller mis-stepped , putting her hand to the mat to steady herself . It was all the room Dawes needed . <p> Even as she was saying afterwards that " I do n't feel like I 've broken any barrier at all , " the results surely rattled the windows at gymnastics federations throughout eastern Europe . Given a month to reflect , Dawes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swept before in lesser competitions but I never expected it at nationals . " <p> Wanted : More black gymnasts <p> That Dawes , as an African-American , has made this run in a white- dominated sport is a detail almost lost . Not until Ron Galimore in 1980 did an African-American make a U.S. Olympic gymnastics team . None until Dawes and Barcelona teammate Betty Okino had won a medal , a fact that gnaws at federation officials . <p> " It 's a segment of the marketplace that we have not been very successful in tapping , " said Sandy Knapp , chairman of the board of USA Gymnastics . " There is probably no more an effective way to reach out , to extend an invitation to show the potential that gymnastics offers . There have got to be scores of young black kids today thinking about gymnastics who may have never thought about it without Dominique and the success she 's had . " <p> And if a racial obligation is lobbed atop the load on Dawes ' back , it shares space with scholastics and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best hope . Gymnasts exist only through the ability to focus on the next routine , the next event . Perhaps that is how , when asked if gymnastics remains fun , Dominique Dawes still grins and says , " Can be .
