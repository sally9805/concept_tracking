" I wish I could learn to read , " sighed Stella , chewing a mouthful of mud . " It is so ladylike to be educated . " Stella was a steam shovel and made her living eating dirt . She had several bad habits , such as smoking and using wrong grammar , and her manners certainly were very rough . But she had always wanted to be a lady , and she thought all she needed was to learn to read and then she would begin to rise in the world . So when an order came to dig the cellar for a new addition to the schoolhouse , she was delighted . She felt sure that while working under the very windows of the halls of learning , she could hardly help taking in a certain amount of culture . It was a lovely spring morning when Stella set out for the scene of her new labors . Her fireman helped her get up steam , and her engineer steered the huge , clanking , puffing creature up the main street of the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their teachers gathered to watch her before they went into school . The engineer and fireman laid down a rough platform of loose planks for Stella to stand on . She was very heavy , in spite of all the exercises she took , and they did n't want her to sink down into the mud . When the planks were laid to suit her , Stella took up her position on them , and swung her long neck around into a digging position . " All right , let her go ! " yelled the engineer , and with a clank and a rattle , she bit into the sod . The work had begun . The teachers and children trooped into the school . As they went , Stella heard one teacher saying to another , " I tell them , the only way to get an education is just to dig into it . " Dig into it ! I knew it ! thought Stella . You bet , I 'll soon be a lad , , believe me ! And she went to work with a will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a classroom . There was a teacher behind a desk , on a platform , a blackboard with writing on it , and a number of boys and girls sitting in rows . But Stella was making so much noise herself , she could not hear what the teacher said , and the writing on the blackboard might have been Chinese for all it meant to her . From time to time , the men moved the planks , and Stella lumbered a few feet farther on . Each time brought her in front of a new window , and so she saw into several rooms . In one room , the teacher was pouring some bright yellow liquid from one jar into another with something pink in it , and when the two came together they made a fearful smell . Stella did not know.that this was a scientific experiment , for she was just an ignorant old working shovel ; but she was greatly interested , and nearly fell into her own hole , trying to peep through the window . Stella did not believe in wasting time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand , gravel , rocks-anything that came along-without looking . She was so busy watching the science class that she paid no attention to where she should take the next bite . Snort , toot , hiss ! she cried out suddenly . " Whatever have I gone and done ? I do believe I 've busted a tooth ! " And she stopped digging , and let the sand and gravel run out of her mouth . The engineer jumped down from his high seat and rushed around in front to see what was the matter . He pulled Stella 's jaws apart and looked inside her mouth . Sure enough , she had broken one of her big iron teeth , and she was making a terrible noise about it . The engineer took the broken piece out and then examined the remains of the tooth . " Sure , I do n't know what to do ! " he said to the fireman . The fireman did n't know either , but he thought he ought to say something , so he suggested , " Why not get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the engineer . " Go and find one . " So the fireman trotted off , and soon came back with a dentist . Stella was still snorting and hissing . The dentist had brought his files and his forceps and his fillings , but when he looked at the tooth , he said very crossly , " What do you take me for ? I am a dentist , not a blacksmith ! " " Of course ! " said the engineer , looking scornfully at the fireman . " A blacksmith is what we need ! " But there was no blacksmith in that village , for the automobiles had driven the horses away , and all the blacksmith had ever known how to do was shoe horses . So he had moved out into the country , where there were still horses to shoe , and it was several days before they could find him . // I AM NOT A BLACKSMITH ! // The engineer covered up Stella with a big piece of canvas , just as he always did at night ( for she usually slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let her fire go out , and there she stayed , with no more work to do . It was just like camping out . She was able to look out from under her canvas and watch all that went on in the school . Now that she herself was quiet , the teacher 's voice came out to her quite clearly through the open window . But no matter how attentively she listened , she never managed to learn anything , and every day she felt a little more discouraged . Sometimes the boys and girls did not pay attention , and then they did not learn any more than Stella . On those days , the pretty young teacher looked very much discouraged , too . Then one day Stella saw the boys and girls come running out of the schoolhouse , laughing and shouting . " Vacation 's here ! School 's over ! " they cried , tossing their caps up in the air as they hurried through the gate . Then Stella noticed one boy , who was playing tag with some of his friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right under Stella 's long nose . It was a grammar book ! " Now ai n't it a shame ? " said Stella to herself . " All that education wasted ! " She could not understand how anyone could be glad that school was over . If only she had had the chance those foolish young people were throwing away ! Suddenly she had a great idea , and thrusting out her long nose , she quickly picked up the grammar book . You see , she had heard of people " devouring " books , so she devoured the grammar book , because , she thought , that was the way it was done . " Now I have really got some learning inside me , " she told herself , " and if I can digest it , I ought to become quite a highbrow . " She did n't feel any pains inside , so she thought the book must be digesting nicely , and went back to sleep in great contentment . In the morning , her two attendants , the engineer and fireman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The things that blacksmith did to poor Stella ! But she bore the worst of it like a soldier , because she knew if she held still , it would be over sooner . // SHE NEVER LEARNED ANYTHING // Meanwhile , the engineer sat down nearby to read the morning paper . Stella looked over his shoulder , sure that she could read it , too , now that she was so full of learning . Although the blacksmith had both hands in her mouth , she could see over his head . The headlines of the paper were printed in nice large letters that anyone in the first grade could have read , but poor Stella could make nothing out of them . That perfectly good grammar book that she had swallowed had done her no good at all ! She was so disappointed that she gave a great sigh and nearly blew the blacksmith over backward . " I thought you said the fire was out ! " he said to the engineer . " It is , " said he , and went on reading . CAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complained the blacksmith . " Nonsense ! " said the engineer . " Fire 's been out for a week . Get busy and finish that tooth , will you ? We 're behind time on this job , now . " So the blacksmith went back to his work , and soon the tooth was as good as new . The fireman began shoveling in coal to get Stella 's fire going again . As she stood there waiting , feeling very melancholy , she saw the young teacher , whom she had been watching for so long , enter the school room . First she gathered the books and papers she had left in her desk ; then she sat down in her chair on the platform , put her head on the desk , and began to cry . Stella wondered if she had a toothache , too . A scrub woman , who was cleaning the room , went up to the platform with her bucket and mop , and said , " What 's the matter , dearie ? " // " Oh , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of the children do n't seem to like school , and they do n't learn a thing . I am afraid I am not a good teacher . I wish I could be something else , but it 's all I know how to do . " " Well , well , " said the scrub woman , " that 's queer , now ! I get that way sometimes myself , but I always thought that if I could be a teacher , I 'd be perfectly happy . I 'm not an educated woman and can only scrub floors . So I just try to keep the schoolhouse nice and clean , for that 's my job . " Then the teacher dried her eyes and said , " Maggie , you make me feel ashamed . I believe you are right . It 's not so important what our job is as the way we do it . " When Stella heard that , she began to feel better , and when the engineer gave the signal to begin work , she went at it like three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the engineer to the fireman that noon as they were eating their lunch , " I never saw anything like the way the old girl bit into it this morning . She must have had something the matter with that tooth for a long time . " Stella said nothing , but she knew the trouble had n't been in her tooth . <p>
