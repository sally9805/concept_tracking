 | pulled us to her bed . By the time the sun came up I was half out of my mind . I had crossed the line from exhaustion to being so completely awake I was aware of every time I blinked my eyes . I was suddenly afraid of everything . I did n't know how we could get through breakfast , I did n't know how we would ever get back any peace in our lives . It was as if everything was ruined now . It could not be reversed . The night we lost would never be regained . At five-thirty that morning Beatrice started to move in her bed , pulling up her legs and twisting her head from side to side . " This is it , " she said . But we were wrecked . Angie started to cry , her hands were shaking . I got up quickly , quicker than I had in two months , and went down the dark stairs and through the dark corridor past the kitchen . I knocked on the door at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " help me . " A voice asleep but not tired like my own called me inside . There was a small old woman in the bed , short and round beneath her blanket . She sat up and started looking for her glasses . Her hair was completely white and it fell halfway down her back . She had on a flannel nightgown with a row of forget-me-nots around the collar . " Rose ? " she said . I could not get over the sight of Sister Evangeline , who was not a nun but any woman in her bed . " I need help , " I said . She clicked on the little lamp beside her bed and we stared at each other in disbelief . " Oh , Lord , " she said , " look at you . " I looked down and saw my hands were shaking like Angie 's . I felt like I could n't stand up . " Help me , " I said . She got up and covered her head and immediately looked like herself again . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coife . It made sense to me now . She pulled on her bathrobe and went into the bathroom and got a bottle of rubbing alcohol . Then she went through the kitchen , picking up a stack of clean dishtowels , a ball of string , and her favorite knife , the one with the black handle she used for cutting tomatoes . " I wish you girls had n't done this , " she said , not with anger , but as a matter of fact . " It 's been a long time . I do n't imagine it 's something you forget , but I 'd rather , well , that does n't matter now . This is what we have to do and we 'll do it . " We climbed back up the stairs and went into the room . In the few minutes I was gone everything had changed . Beatrice had crossed the line . The contractions counted for something now . Regina had taken on a new clarity . She seemed alert and calm ,  | ing off Beatrice 's forehead with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said sweetly . " Everything is fine . " " I 've never done two , " Sister Evangeline said . " I do n't even ink my mother did two . " She washed her hands in the sink in and again until I thought her skin would bleed . " I do n't think I 'm going to be able to keep quiet about this uch longer , " Beatrice said . " It does n't matter , sweetheart , " Sister Evangeline said . " You ng out if it makes you feel better . You 're too far along to move 1w . You 're going to have your way . " She peered down between trice 's legs and slipped two fingers inside her . " Right there , " said , " all ready to go . Two fine boys . The next time you sh . Next time you 're ready , you get one out . " " I do n't want to do this , " Beatrice said , and took short ths . Angie came and stood beside me , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Regina seemed completely calm , whispering and sponging , staying right on the bed beside her . What can I say about this ? I had never seen a birth . I 'm not sure I had ever really imagined it . It was like a movie that made you close your eyes and then open them again , until you were unable to either watch or look away . I remember that birth had a smell as heavy and salted as blood itself , and I remember that Beatrice never cried out , even after Sister said she could . It was a point of honor . She said she would be quiet start to finish and she was . " There 's so little to do , " Sister Evangeline said , easing out the first shoulders . " They do it all themselves . " When I saw that first wet fish , its slickness , its blue cord , I pressed my hands against my stomach . The gates were open now to every longing Angie talked about late at night . This baby . My baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when I woke up she would be gone . Never gone . I thought , never , never . Sister Evangeline tied string in two places on the cord and drew her knife through what connected Beatrice to her son . Her hands were fast and sure the way they 'd never been in the kitchen . She turned him over and loosened the fluids from his throat and he cried as his mother had not . Regina took him from Sister 's hands and carried him to the sink with complete certainty and Beatrice laughed , as loud and coarse as she ever had in her life . The second one was not free , as Beatrice 's grandmother had told her , but it came more easily . Beatrice turned her head to the side . The light sounds she made seemed almost like desire , as if things had come full circle , and her face again contorted  | the way it had that night nine months ago . Regina gave me the first baby so she could take the second . She had wrapped him tightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old . A face more exhausted than my own . Mother Corinne came in just as the second cord was being cut . She looked at the knife and the blood across Sister Evange-line 's blue terry cloth robe . You could tell by her face that at first she simply did n't understand , thought that what had happened revolved somehow around that knife . " Evangeline , " she said . " It came on her so fast , " Regina said . " She just had them . She was fine and then she just had them . I woke up Angie and Rose and they got Sister Evangeline . There was no time at all . " " Why did n't you come to me ? " Mother Corinne said to me . She was furious . The blood had soaked through the mattress , onto the carpet . " I was asleep , " I said . " I just went to Sister Evangeline . I could n't think . By the time she got up here to see what was wrong it was all happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rinsing the blood from his open mouth . Girls started coming down the hall . Suddenly the world was up and pressing into the room . Every pregnant girl come to see her fate , and Beatrice laughing , laughing , a son in each arm . Sister Bernadette came and Mother Corinne told her to call for an ambulance . It would take an hour to arrive at least . Sister Evangeline pressed down into Beatrice and kneaded her abdomen until the afterbirth pushed out , and then she scooped it up in her hands and carried it to the wastepaper basket to throw it away . I followed Beatrice to the door of the ambulance and then followed the ambulance down the road . It was snowing hard and the tires slipped a little as they turned . Maybe someone called to me and I did n't hear them or maybe they did n't call . It was as if everyone was wandering blind and I happened to be the one who went outside . Or maybe other girls were outside . If they were , well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my capacity for worry , had used up every ounce of worry I had in me over the last twenty-four hours . Beatrice , Angie , Sister Evangeline , poor Regina . I should have been worried for them , but instead I watched the ambulance fade into whiteness , until all I could see were the red lights , spinning , and after a while , not even them . I pulled my bathrobe closer to my throat . I had put on my  | shoes at some point , because I saw them there . I knew it must he cold , but all I felt was wet . Without worry to protect me , every thought that came into my mind received real attention . For the first time I saw myself clearly , waking up in the hospital the next morning alone . I would not be brave like Beatrice . I would not win those few hours . Even if I could , they would not dent my need . I could go hack to Thomas . He would take me still , I was sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off my car . How amazed he would be to see me like this , how he would fall to his knees to have me back , both of us back . Or I could go to my mother 's , who would hide me from Thomas , or back to Billy 's in Arkansas . I could go someplace where I could keep this baby . I saw those good parents crying . " Our girl , " they 'd say . But there were other girls for them . Saint Elizabeth 's raised them , rich , fertile fields of babies . I was through with giving things up . I wanted something of my own . I kept going through the snow , as if the place I was going was someplace I had to walk to . My feet got heavier as the snow started caking to my shoes . But I could n't see where I was going . It was white in every direction and the dark lines around the edges could have been trees or hotels or towns . I should have been worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just could n't . I was thinking about the candles , about all the years I waited for my sign from God . I thought about it long and hard , and then I made a decision . " I 'm not counting that one , " I said . " I took it the wrong way . There has n't been a sign . I was really good , You know . For a long time . You should n't forget that . " I shoved my hands in my pockets and started walking in small circles . " Im saying that I 'll do what You want me to do if You just give me some kind of hint about what that is . Do You hear me ? " I was shouting , the snow was filling up my mouth . " Your will be done . Okay ? Tell me what in the hell that 's supposed to be . " " Rose ! " a voice called . I looked up but did n't see anything at first . I was hoping for a quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for you everywhere . " The figure that came toward me in the whiteness was huge , big enough to be the Son of Man . He who so loved man He sent His only Son . Son took off his coat and wrapped it around me , bundled me  | like newspapers , firewood , and lifted me up . " Who were you talking to ? What were you saying ? " But I did n't answer him . I was watching the snow go past me , the dark bank getting closer . I was riding . Being carried . I am five feet ten inches tall . I had not been carried since the night my appendix burst , when the superintendent struggled under my weight to take me down the stairs to his car . It was summer and hot and I was burning up with fever and I felt him try to shift my weight in his arms , but now the snow beat down on us so hard it stung my face , and I was huge , two people in one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never faltered . They were bigger even than us . He took such giant steps . I looked down and saw the footprints rushing behind us , filling up with snow as they receded , being swallowed back into the smooth white landscape like we had never walked in this pasture at all . We went to Son 's house because it was closer than the hotel . Son laid me down on his bed and took off my shoes . He rubbed my feet in his hands , my hands in his hands . He pulled off his sweater and unbuttoned his shirt and put my feet against his warm chest . He rubbed my legs and covered me in blankets . He was full of motion , never stopped moving . " Do n't freeze up on me , " he said to my calf . His voice was shaking . And at that moment a little bit of me came back because I was worried about him . " I 'll be all right , " I said . He looked up , embarrassed at being overheard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those wet things , " he said . " Can you do that ? " I nodded . He brought me a shirt and a sweater and some long underwear and socks . Even in my present condition they would be too big . " Put these on , " he said . " I 'll get you in front of the fire . " I peeled off my wet clothes and tried to dress , but everything about me was slow . I could n't think enough to make my hands work , to see the difference between shirt and socks . I worked my way slowly into the fabric , wrapping myself again and again in blankets . I had started to shiver . I could finally feel the cold and it was brutal . Son came back in and carried me to the sofa , which he 'd moved right in front of the fire . " You do n't have any frostbite that I can see , " he said , going back to work on my hands . " What could have possessed you to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beatrice , " I said , but I did n't say anything else . I did n't feel like talking . I just sat and watched the fire for a long time and then went to sleep . When I woke up , it was dark and the snow had stopped . Son was sitting in my chair , watching . He had stayed awake and kept the fire going . " Angie 's going to think I 'm dead , " I said . " I went over there and told them . They said to just let you sleep for a while . They wanted to take you into the hospital , but I said you were fine . I do n't think you were out there very long . " " Is it late ? " " No , no . Not even suppertime . But you 've been asleep all day , since eight o'clock this morning . " My sense of time had been destroyed in the snow . This was still the same day . This morning was still connected to today . I sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seen so many blankets in your life . " I do n't know what I 'm going to do , " I said . " About what ? " " The baby . " I yawned and shook my head , trying to force the sleep out of me . " What do you want to do about it ? " " Keep it , " I said , out loud and clear for the first time in my life . " I 'm going to keep it and I do n't know how . " " Stay here . " " I ca n't stay here , they would n't let me . " " Stay here , " he said . " Marry me and they 'll let you stay . " I turned around and looked at him . He looked at the fire for a minute and then turned to me . " Many me , Rose , " he said . " I 'm not going to try and talk you into something you do n't want to do , but it makes good sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby up together . " I thought about it for a minute . Maybe this was the way it was supposed to be for me . God was telling me He was right after all . I was supposed to be married , live a small life with a man I did n't love . My old life seemed so far away at that moment that I figured the last marriage had been erased somehow , that I had come far enough to negate it . " All right , " I said . Son looked at me , puzzled , then smiled . " Really ? " " Really . " He stood up , his head nearly touching the ceiling . The look on his face was so completely happy that I realized for the first  | time that he was in love with me . The dinners in the kitchen , the chair , that he was the one who went to find me in the snow . He loved me , and I was sorry about that . It would only make things harder between us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " We 'll work out the details of all of this later . " " No , " I said . " I want to do this now . Tonight . If you want to marry me , then marry me tonight . " " But there 's no time to plan anything . You 'll want to call someone , your family . You 'll want to get a dress to wear . " " I do n't need a wedding , " I said . " I need to get married . I do n't care about anything else . " Son sat down beside me . He thought it over . " I know there 's a justice in Owensboro . If we called him now he might stay open for us . " " Then call , " I said . Son spent a couple of minutes on the phone and then came back . " He said he 'd wait for us . " " Good . " I got up and Son brought me his coat . " Do you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " I 've got something in the back . " We walked out to his truck and climbed inside . My shoes were soaking wet and cold . " I 'll drive you over to the hotel so you can change , " he said . " I do n't want to change . " I did n't want the time to stop or think . I just wanted to go . " You 're going to get married in my clothes ? " " It looks that way . " So we headed toward Owensboro . The road was covered with snow , but it did n't seem to bother Son . He was a little worried , happy about the way things were turning out , but took my clothes and lack of desire to plan as troubling signs . " We can get a bigger place in town , " he said . " Later , maybe . Your place is fine with me for now . The baby wo n't need her own room for a while . " " Her ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl . " Son smiled . " A girl , " he said . " That 's something , all right . " He looked at me for a second , me or my stomach , it was hard to tell . " I 'd like to give her my last name , if that suits you . " " That would be nice , " I said , and then thought about it for a minute . " What is your name , Son ? " " Abbott , " he said . " Wilson Abbott . " p " Wilson , " I said , and nodded . " You do n't have to tell me about the father . That 's your own business . As far as I 'm concerned , we start from right now , right this minute . Whatever 's in the past belongs to you . Private . " " I 'd like that . " " So if you want , this baby can be yours and mine , you know , as far as she 's concerned . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth . " " I think so . " " I 've always wanted a baby , Rose . I 'll be a good father . " " I know , " I said . " That 's why we 're doing this . " I should have been kinder to him . He was changing his life for me , some woman he really did n't know at all , but I could n't seem to bring a kind word out of my mouth . I wanted him to know what this was all about for me , so that if he wanted to change his mind he could . I did n't want to think I was tricking him in any way . The driving was slow because the roads were still bad , even where the plows had come through . I hardly ever got out at night . I thought about going to the movies as a teenager , out to dinner . I was getting married . I tried to remember something about my first wedding , but I could n't , not even the dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The judge told us he was just about to give up . " I 've got a family , " he said . " I ca n't be waiting around on folks all night . " When I took off Son 's coat he stared at my stomach and then at Son . " So that 's all the rush , " he said . " Looks like you coulda got here a mite quicker . " " We just want to get married , " Son said . " Have to is more like it from where I 'm standing . " He was a man in his fifties who wore a dark suit and red tie . He was so happy to see scandal , so pleased for a little diversion . " Most times we see a girl like that she 's got her papa holding a shotgun on some poor boy . But you 're no boy , mister . You could be this girl 's daddy yourself . " Son put his hand on the man 's shoulder . The hand said , Remember how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get about your business . " I 'll have to call my wife and my son over to witness , " he said , dialing the phone . " They just live around the block . I told them you 'd be coming . They 're waiting on you , too . " The man rang up his wife and by the time we were comfortable in our chairs they had arrived , a short , round woman with tight curls and a boy who was tall and thin and not bad looking . I wondered  | if they had picked him up at Saint Elizabeth 's eighteen years before , as he bore no resemblance to his parents . " Take your places here , " the man said , and arranged us in front of his desk , Son and I standing together , his wife beside me , his son beside Son . They looked bored . They were tired of marriage , had seen it all before . The woman pulled at a thread on her dress which came out and out without end . She snapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was trying hard not to look at my clothes , Son 's clothes . I had a hand up underneath my sweater , holding up his long underwear , which was dingy from too much washing and a little frayed around the seams . The man opened his book and started reading quickly . I remembered those words . Dearly beloved . Honor and obey . Sickness and in health . Until death do us part . I had said them before and for that second I wondered if Son had as well . When the man asked me my name so that he could say , do you , Wilson Abbott , take , I said , Martha Rose Clinton , and Son looked at me surprised . He did n't know my name either and had been too polite to ask . I thought about giving my maiden name , Sloan , but I was used to Clinton . There were people who knew me by that name , and consistency is the most important part of a lie . When the service was over the man started in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good night and shook our hands and wished us luck . " It was a real nice wedding , " the woman said to me . " Prettiest I 've seen in a while . " Her voice sounded like a record . Her kind words were part of what you bought . They were meant to leave a good taste in your mouth , so that for the next marriage you would remember to come back and try them again . The boy smiled politely but was quiet . Then they were gone . " I 'll need to see birth certificates , " he said . Son took his out of his wallet and unfolded it . I said I did n't have mine . " Do n't have it ? " the man said . " Then what did we just go through all of this for ? No birth certificate , no marriage . It 's as simple as that . " " She 's from California , " Son said , by way of explanation . " I do n't care if she 's from France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this state . " Son sighed and reached into his wallet . He laid five ten-dollar bills on the desk . The man touched them with his finger . " Plus the cost of the service . That 's twelve dollars . " Son counted out twelve dollars . A five and seven ones , and  | put his wallet back into his pocket . The justice showed us where to put our names and then signed the paper with a flourish . " Done , " he said . " Married . " Son and I stood out in the snow and looked at each other for a minute . " So , " he said . " Well , " I said . There was n't much to say in the car going back . " Martha is a pretty name , " Son told me . " I never use it , " I said . " That was my sister 's name , Martha . " I thought about asking him about his brothers and sisters , his family , where he was from , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . I rested my head against the glass and watched the dark white world . " Well , " he said when we pulled up in front of Saint Eliz-abeth 's , " I guess I 'll see you tomorrow , dinner for sure . " " What do you mean ? " I asked him . " Well , you 're going to go to bed , right ? It 's getting late . " " I 'm coming home with you . " " Tonight ? " " You married me , Son . I guess that 's the way it should be , unless you 'd rather I did n't . " He rubbed his neck uneasily . " No , no . You should do whatever you want . I mean , of course you 're welcome with me . It 's your house , too . I just thought you might not want people to know . " " We have n't done anything wrong . They 'll all know sooner or later . " " Sure , " he said . " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . " " I 'll wait for you . " " Go home , " I said . " I may be awhile . I 'll walk over later . " " I 'll wait for you in the kitchen , " he said , and we went into the Hotel Louisa through separate doors . Angie was asleep when I came in , and I wondered if she had gone to bed early or if she had been asleep all day . I sat down on the edge of her bed and looked at her pretty face . Asleep she was a child . You could almost read her dreams across her forehead . I touched her hair . " Hey , " I said . She opened her eyes , blinked , and smiled . " I was so worried when you left , " she said .  | " Im okay . " " Son told us he found you out in the snow . You must have gone a little crazy , huh ? " " A little . " " Me too , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door and I could n't stop crying , you know . Just could n't stop . I thought I was going to jump out the window there for a second . " " Angie . " " What ? " " I 'm married now . I got married tonight . " She raised up on her elbow . " Go on , " she said . " No , I did . " I touched her face . I wished I had a sister . I wished there was blood between us . " I married Son . " " You 're not joking , are you ? " " No . " " Why , Rose ? " she whispered . " I 'm going to keep the baby and I just did n't see how I could do it alone . If I married Son then I can stay here . This would n't be such a bad place to raise a baby . " She stared at me , her eyes open wide . She was completely awake . " I 'm jealous , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish it was me . " She looked down at her stomach , pushed at it with one finger . " You 're doing the wrong thing . Nobody gets married like that , it 's crazy . You did it because of Beatrice , not because you love him , but I would have done it , too . " She looked at me . She wanted me to tell her how it could all be the same again . " If I had been the one to walk outside . If I was the one he found . I would have married him , too . " " I know . " I was quiet for a second , waiting to tell her the rest . " Im going over there tonight , " I said finally . " I have to get things started now before I think about it too much . " " You married him , " she said . " I figured you 'd go over there . " We looked at each other for a long time . I was moving to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I would still be at Saint Elizabeth 's every day . We would have been split apart soon anyway , when the babies were born , and knowing all of that I still could not stand to leave her . She scooted over in her bed and lay down flat on her back . " Come here , " she said . I lay down beside her . We were too big to face each other , but we lay there together and looked up at the dark ceiling and held hands . " It 's going to be fine , " she said . " It 's going to be good , even . "  | 1 1 " You too , " I said . " But I wish you were n't leaving . I wish we were going to be together . " After a while she pretended to be asleep , but I could tell she was n't . I got up and took a few things , a clean dress , my toothbrush , some underwear . I would get the rest later . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything about it . Son was in the kitchen with Sister Evangeline , having something to eat . When I came through the door she nearly threw herself at me . " This is just the way it should be , " she said . " I was going to tell you , a million times , but I did n't . " She clapped her hands . " I kept it all a secret all this time . I am so happy , Rosie . I 've never been so happy . What a big day . I deliver two babies in the morning and my best girl gets married at night . There 's never been a day like this in all the world . " " You knew ? " " Sure I knew . " She waved her hand , dismissing me . " Of course I knew . I know all sorts of things . " " More than just the babies ? " " It 's in my diary . The week you started working in the kitchen , I said , Rose will marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know that you two had even properly met then . I had to drop my rosary down next to the stove . My rosary ! That 's how sure I was . " " I do n't want to hear this . " " That 's your problem , Rosie , you never want to know . All sorts of things going on out there and you do n't want to know about them until they land on your plate . " Son sat at the table , smiling . He did n't care how it happened , only that it had . I was tired . " Well , you two get going , " she said , and gave me a little push toward Son . " I 'll see you in the morning , if you 're feeling up to work . You 've had a big day today . You might want to take tomorrow off . " " I might , " I said . I kissed her good night , even though I felt strangely angry at her for knowing my business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked different than it had five hours before . It was my house now , at least to a small part . I looked around the living room . " Are you Catholic ? " I asked him .  | " No , " he said . " I 'm not much of anything . Does that mat-ter ? " " No , " I said . " I was just wondering . " We took off our coats and stood in front of the fireplace , which was cold . " I could start a fire , " he said . " I think we ought to go to bed , probably . " " Sure , " he said . " You must be tired . You can have the bedroom , I 'll sleep in here . I fall asleep in here half the time , anyway . " " I know I 'm no great find , " I said . " But you might as well get used to sleeping with me . We 're married . We 've only got one bedroom . " Son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . " You , Rose ? Dear God , there was never such a find . " He came to me and put his hand on my face . With the base of his palm against my jaw , his fingers curved all the way up the side of my head . And then he kissed me , very lightly on the side of my nose and then my lips , then on my lips again . We went into the bedroom and I took off my clothes . I would not be embarrassed , I told myself . This was the body he had married , this is the one he would have to see . We kept the lights off , but the moon against the snow made the room seem nearly bright . " Look at you , " he said . " Look how pretty you are . " " I 'm not pretty , " I said . " You have no idea . " I slid in between the covers , not lightly , not sexy , and pushed my back against the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took off his overalls and sat down beside me in his shirt and underwear . " You might as well get used to it , " I said . " It 's been a long time . " " Well , nothing 's going to happen , at least not for a while . Just sleep with me . " I touched his back . A tree , a wall , a city . He took off the rest of his clothes and lay down beside me . I saw something on his arm , a birthmark or a scar , and leaned over to look at it . It was a tattoo . It said Cecilia in green letters near his shoulder , a cluster of leaves beneath the name . " Who 's Cecilia ? " I said . " Someone I knew a long time ago . " " You must have loved her , to put her name on your arm . " " I thought I did . " " Do n't say that , " I said quietly . " Do n't change your past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm . " I ran my fingers across the letters , up the C , over the e and the 1 , down to the a.  | I could feel his skin tense beneath my hand . " That means you loved her . " " Okay , " he said . We did n't say anything for a while but did n't sleep either . " It 's going to be all right , " he said to me finally . " We 've done the right thing . " " Yes , " I said . " And it will be good for the baby . " " Yes . " " What are you going to name her ? If you know it 's going to be a girl , you must have picked out a name . " " No . I never did . I was always so sure I was going to give her up . I thought it would be better to not give her a name . I thought that would only make things worse . " " But you must have thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , I did n't . " " So now you should think about it . " And I did . I thought about it for a long while . " Cecilia , " I said finally . " I 'm going to name her Cecilia . " " No , " he said . " It would be perfect . We 'll tell her you had her name put on your arm the day she was born , that you loved her so much you went out and had her name written right here . " I touched the tattoo again and he flinched . " Do n't do that , Rose . I 'm asking you . " " Cecilia , " I said . " That 's her name . "  | THERE ARE SO MANY pretty names for girls , Caroline and Emily and Bess . Those are the three I thought of right off . Then there are all the names you could choose ' cause you wanted to make somebody else feel good . Angie , Evangeline , June . Or Beatrice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way . She could call her Elizabeth for the saint or Louisa for the hotel . In the hospital gift shop , I bought a book called Naming Your Baby . You would n't believe all the pretty names in there , ones you 'd never think of , like Madeline and Isabel . In the end , there was only one name that would n't be right , which is the name Rose had settled on . Cecilia . In the weeks before the baby was born , I begged Rose a hundred different ways to change her mind . Once I even tried putting my foot down . " You will not , " I said over breakfast , and looked at her straight enough to scare her , but I must have forgot who I was dealing with . Rose do n't scare . She do n't even ruffle . She just whisked my plate up off the table , her belly so big in front of her you hardly know how she could move about at all , and she looks at me as if to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name my baby ? " Rose , " I said , " listen . " " Come on now , " she said . " I 've got to get to work . " Before I know it she 's got the dishes clean and her coat on and she 's out the door to make breakfast for twenty-five other girls , none of them as far along as her . She did n't stop working in the kitchen . She stayed there till the last possible minute , was stirring up a birthday cake for someone when her own water broke out on the tile floor . Rose was a strong girl . She 's the only woman I ever knew 117  | who felt as big as me . Not that she 's anywhere as tall as me , but her hands and feet are big and the bones across her shoulders are sturdy . When you find a beautiful woman who 's small , small like Cecilia , there 's something about her that makes you want to cradle her in your hands . You want to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a little secret that you own . But Rose 's beauty was something that no one person could keep . It filled up every room she went into . I remember the first time I saw her , standing up on the porch with Angie . She put a shadow over every girl there . Her white neck , the length of her thighs against the worn blue cotton of her dress , the line of her jaw under her dark hair . I thought , what 's she doing here ? What kind of man would let her get away ? But I never asked her about that man and she never asked me anything about Cecilia , except whether or not I 'd loved her . She was always staring at her name across my shoulder when we were in bed at night . She made like it was the tattoo she was really interested in . " Did it hurt ? " she asked . " I do n't remember . It was a long time ago . " " But it must have hurt . Needles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , " I said . Pain is one of those things where the big ones just wipe the small ones away , so I really could n't imagine a needle working in and out of my arm when I was seventeen could have hurt so much . I loved lying in bed with Rose , smelling her warm skin , running my hand down against her sides once she fell asleep . Ev erything about her was big ; her belly was a mountain , her breas and legs were smooth and swollen and round . In bed with her did n't feel lonely the way I did with other women who had fall asleep beside me . Not that I 'm saying there 'd been so many , b there were enough to know . Sleep brings out the smallness in woman , their little hands holding the edge of the pillow w they dream . I felt so huge beside them . I was afraid they wo wake up and be scared to see me there . I never touched th while they slept . But Rose could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born , when her body whittled do into its old self , she was still a match for me . There was som thing about Rose , not just her size but who she was . I could she 'd seen some things . When we were married she was n't twenty-four and I was forty-five . I 'd seen plenty , more than G will forgive me for , but not more than Rose . Even knowing as little as I did , I knew that much . That first month was the only time in our marriage we w  | ever alone , if you can call living so close to Saint Elizabeth 's being alone . Me and Rose both stayed over there pretty much all the time , same as always . We were used to it that way . Some days it seemed like nothing had changed . I was still eating dinner in the big kitchen while she cleaned up , and as she washed dishes I would find myself looking at her breasts under her wet apron and then looking away so she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wife , and hell , I 've seen her coming out of the bathtub in the morning , big as life . So I tried to tell myself it was okay if I looked , that I do n't have nothing to be ashamed of , but it 's hard for me to believe . When a man gets to be my age , he do n't much expect things will change . Winter and you press caulk into the windows , summer and you 're putting up the screens . The pipes give way one by one . By the time you 've repainted the whole place inside and out it 's time to start over again . You 're alone and you 'll always he alone . It 's so true it does n't bear mention . You just stop thinking about it , the way you stopped thinking about everything after a while . But then here comes Rose , after eighteen years of pregnant girls come and gone . After the first day I saw her I found myself looking for her . I hoped she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I went to the kitchen at night to find her . It had been so long since I 'd done anything like that that for a while I did n't even know I was doing it . Then all of the sudden I 'm lonely at night . I could n't remember the last time I was lonely . I would think of her , the way she pushed her hair behind her ear with one wet hand , the way she blew on a spoon of soup she was tasting for salt . I longed for her . Not like I longed for a woman at seventeen , not like I longed for Cecilia , where I wanted to feel her hands on my back and press my face against her neck . I only wanted to be near to Rose . I guess maybe I wanted the rest of it too , but that kind of longing had pretty much been worn out of me . I 'd come to believe that part of my life was over . So when I found her that morning in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woke up and said yes , she would marry me , everything changed . It was like the sun had set in the east , and suddenly nothing was like it was , even though everything was like it was . I ca n't explain it . It felt like I should be ming home to another house , living in a different state , that thing of my old life should have stayed the same because I as suddenly a married man . But instead we went on just like  | before , except now the longing was n't there . Rose was there , beside me in my bed . We stayed pretty formal for a long time , always being polite to each other . You many a person you do n't really know and you 're afraid of saying something that might run them off . But we got along fine . The only sore point between us was over the naming of the baby , which was n't even a sore point with Rose ' cause she simply refused to see it as a problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't want her to go through with it . Five days before our baby came , Angie went into the hospital . She went right away , the very first pain that she felt , which I think is as it should be . I had taken a real liking to Angie , she was always one to stop and tell you a joke or throw out a big wave when she saw you coming across the field . Rose was a wreck right from the minute Angie told her it was time , rubbing her hands the way she does when she gets nervous . She insisted on taking her to the hospital . We put Angie 's suitcase in the back , but the box she had with her she wanted to hold up front . " I ca n't believe the way they listen to you now , " Angie said , pressed between us in the front of the truck , the three of us all as big as houses . " It 's like you 're one of the sisters . " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , no , I mean , you 've got that kind of power . The way you stared them down and said , No , Son and I will take her to the hospital . ' " Angie laughed . " Like , la-di-da , I 'm running this show now . Well , I think it 's something , is all . You stay on , they 're gon na be calling that place Saint Rose the Divine . " " I like the sound of that , " I said . Then Angie bunched up her face and grabbed on to my arm so hard I liked to drive right off the road . " God ! What ? " I said . Rose reached over and smoothed back her hair , and Angie took a few short , quick breaths . " She was n't lying , " Angie said . " This is gon na hurt . " " Are you okay to make the drive ? " I asked . Angie laughed . " What if I 'm not ? " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two of them came into the emergency room the nurses like to took a fit , two girls so pregnant coming in together . Angie gave the nurse her box and said something to her about the letter  | that 's taped on top of it . The nurse said that nothing could be left at the front desk , but Angie held her ground . Tired as she was she would n't get in the wheelchair until they promised to do exactly what she told them . The nurse took the box , and they started to wheel Angie through the doors , when all of a sudden she raised both arms over her head and called out for Rose . " What is it ? " Rose said , going to her . Angie just smiled and shook her head . " Never mind , " she said . " What ? " " I was gon na say I changed my mind . " Rose was squatted down on the floor beside her chair and the two of them just stared at each other , their noses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she meant , changed her mind about having it or changed her mind about giving it up . Then my wife leaned over and kissed her friend on the forehead , so sweetly and right that it made me look away . Once Angie was gone the doctor tried to talk Rose into staying on , said her time was so close it was hardly worth the trip home . I did n't think it would be a bad idea . I wanted to see her have some rest . But she would n't hear of it . All she wanted to talk about was Angie . Every five minutes she was out of her chair , going to ask about Angie and the baby . They kept saying fine , fine , everything looks great , but Rose would n't settle . " Come on and sit , " I said to her . " You 're going to wear out the floor . " " I hate this . " " Well , she 's fine . You heard the doctor . " " She 's too thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but when I reached for her she moved away just slightly so that my hand fell down across her back and barely touched it . We waited there all night and Rose never fell asleep , even though I 'm sure I did . When the doctor came out , all solemn , you could see in Rose 's face that she had already resigned herself to what he was about to say and was ready to take it . The cord had worked its way around the neck and by the time they knew , it was all too late . Rose looked up at him . " You mean it could have been pre-vented ? " " No , " the doctor said . " There was no way to tell . " " But if you 'd known something was going to go wrong ? " Her  | voice was high , almost like she was about to start shouting at him . The doctor looked puzzled . " If we 'd known , " he said slowly , " then yes , I guess we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about things like that . " Rose sat still for the first time , her hands folded between her knees , her head down . Finally she nodded . " All right , " she said . " You can see her for a minute if you 'd like , " the doctor told her . Rose got up and started to follow him down the hall . She 'd forgotten I was there , and so I just went along behind them . " Maybe she does n't know , " I said . " She knows , " Rose said , not turning around . I almost went inside the room with her , but when I saw An-gie 's face , looking so small and pale against the starched white pillow slip , I stepped back . The doctor went on , reading a chart as he walked away from us . I sat down on a chair in the hallway , not wanting to listen but hearing it just the same . " Hey , " Rose said . " It did n't go so good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more tired than sad . They would have given her something . They would give her one good long sleep before she had to wake up and remember everything for the rest of her life . " You 're fine , " Rose said . " That 's what matters . You 're just perfect . " " I do n't feel it . " There was a long silence and I felt for Rose , wondering what it was she was supposed to say to her friend . I looked up and down the hallway . No one was there but one lone nurse , and she turned into a room before I could get a good look at her . I could hear her shoes squeak away from me and the door click shut behind her . It was late , but the fluorescent lights made it seem like high noon . I thought about how everything in that hall would always be just so . The brown and black tiles on the floor would always be scrubbed clean , the walls would always be the same dull green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soap , which was trying to cover something up , sickness and worse . " Rose ? " Angie 's voice was sleepy , fading , a million miles away . " What ? "  | " You knew , did n't you ? " " Knew what ? " " About my baby . Sister Evangeline would have known , she would have told you . " She stopped for a while , and I held my breath . " It makes sense now , the way she was that day . I never saw her get upset with other girls the way she did with me . " " Of course I did n't know . " " I 'm so stupid , why I never thought about it before . Never thought about it before because I 'm so stupid , right ? " " Go to sleep , Angie . " " And there you were , watching me make all those stupid things and you said it was stupid , did n't you ? " " Angie . " " I 'm not saying I blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You could n't have told me . You would n't want to hurt me . But you could have told me . Maybe if I 'd known I might have been able to do something about it , tell the doctors to watch out . Did you think about that , all that time you were watching me ? " I was on my feet , standing by the door . Rose 's voice came quiet and steady , everything about it said , trust me , believe me . " I never knew this would happen . Nobody knows life and death , not even Sister . It 's just a bad thing , an awful thing . There is n't any reason for it . " And then Angie started to cry and she said something I could n't understand . I looked down at my shoes and felt something like a cold wind go through me because I knew Rose was lying . I did n't know from the way she said it , that 's what worried me . The way she said it I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evangeline , and she would know whether or not a baby was going to live , I was sure of it . Rose would be sure of it , too . " That 's right , " Rose said . " You just cry . " I wanted to look around the corner , see them there . I wondered how her face would look when she lied . But I was intruding just being in the hallway , in the hospital . I should have been in Habit . " I want to go home , " Angie said . " You will soon enough . " " I want to go home with you . " " You 're going home to your mother . " " No . " " Go to sleep . "  | " Rose ? " " What ? " " Take the box of baby clothes . From the front desk , do n't forget it . It was a lucky thing we both had girls , huh ? " " Go to sleep , now . " " Do n't forget it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rose stayed in a while longer , I imagine until Angie fell asleep . When she finally came out of the room she looked worn down . She took hold of my arm , not out of love but because she was afraid she would n't be able to stand up a whole lot longer . Driving back from the hospital I could n't help but think about our wedding , since that was the last time we were in Owensboro , but I did n't think it would be such a good idea to bring it up . It probably would have been best not to bring up anything at all , but Rose looked so tired and sad , staring down at her hands and not saying anything . " It was best , your not telling her , " I said . " Not telling her what ? " she said . Her voice was flat , like she was responding to some worn-out joke that everyone already knew . " Not telling her what Sister Evangeline told you , about her baby dying . If Sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was n't a single thing that could have been done . That 's fate . Divine fate . That 's God 's business . " " I did n't know , " she said . " That 's what I told Angie . " I looked right at her . I did n't care about the road . " I did n't know anything , " she said , and then she closed her eyes , which was her way of saying the conversation was over , even if she was n't going to sleep . When we went back to the hospital a week later Angie had already checked out and gone home to her people , but she was n't the reason we were going up anyway . It was Rose 's time , the two trips so close that in my memory they blur together . It 's hard for me to sort out who had her baby before who sometimes . There was a day , when first I was at Saint Elizabeth 's , I could tell you the delivery time of every baby to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight and whether it was a boy or a girl . I would make a point to remember the weather on that day and the color of the moth-er 's hair and what town she was from . That was when I felt  | a certain responsibility to all those babies , thought that they might come back looking for their true selves some day and appreciate a gardener who had a mind for facts . But it got to be too much is all , and it seemed cruel to remember one and not the other , so I just stopped trying . This girl was to be one of them , this daughter of mine . The one her cousins would whisper about , the one who finds out years later , just by accident , that she is not herself at all . Was it not for so many bits of fate fallen into our laps , my daughter would have been someone else 's daughter . I was like Rose had been in the waiting room the week before , pestering every person in a white coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wife , " I said , the words so right in my mouth . My wife . My family . " She 's doing fine , " they all said , and it bothered me , because it was the same way they told us Angie was fine . The night my daughter was born I thought about her father , just that one time and not later . I thought about him because he did n't know . With just about every girl to come through Saint Elizabeth 's , you can be sure the fellow knew , that she cried and he turned on his heel and left her there . For a long time I wanted to think that was true of Rose , but anyone who knew her at all could see she was a leaver , that she would n't know a thing about what it 's like to be left . Somewhere out in California was a man thinking that right about now his baby was being born , but he did n't know where to start looking , so for just one minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . A child needs one mother , one father . Even if the job was n't meant to be mine , it was now . I would be the only father she would have . I went to the gift shop and bought myself a pack of Luckys . I did n't smoke much , but I figured with the baby around I 'd need to quit altogether , so I was just going to sit in the waiting room and smoke a couple . No sooner did I get one lit than a nurse came out and said , " Congratulations , Mr. Ab-bott . " I stubbed out the cigarette and tossed the pack down on the table for the next poor guy who 'd come to wait . " Everything okay ? " " Better than that , " she said , real chipper , and I thought this must be a pretty sweet job , getting to come out and tell people their babies are born . If anything bad happens they always send out the doctor . " You have a beautiful girl , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She did n't even cry out , Mr. Abbott ,  | not one time . I ca n't remember that happening as long as I 've been here . " I followed her down a long corridor and through a set of double doors that said , NO ADMITTANCE . " You can see her for a second , " she said quietly , " but then you 'll have to go . She needs her rest . " She pointed over to a gurney where Rose was lying . I looked down on Rose for a minute before her eyes half opened and she saw me there . She looked like she 'd been to war . " Hiya , " she said . " Tough time ? " She moved her head around , but I could n't tell if she was nodding or shaking her head no . She reached out for my hand and I gave it to her . " Know what I did ? " she whispered . " No , what ? " " I told them I wanted to fill out the birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bend down to hear her , until my ear was only a few inches from her lips . " The nurse says to me , she says , the father always does that , but I tell her , no , no , not this time . " She smiled . She looked so proud of herself . " I saw her , " she said . " Saw who ? " " Cecilia . " " Please , Rose . " I ran my fingers along the side of her face and down onto her neck . Her skin was still damp with sweat . " I 'm telling you , there 's no reason to do that . " " It 's done , " she said . " In ink . Do n't worry about it , Son . It 's a good idea . It 's a pretty name . " I straightened up , and Rose closed her eyes and let her hand fall away from mine . I walked down the corridor , following the pictures of storks painted on the wall . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the large glass window . So many babies born on the same day in Kentucky . I tried not to look at the names right off . I tried to find the baby that looked like Rose all on my own , but every time I thought I had it right , it turned out I was wrong . " Who are you looking for ? " a nurse asked me . " Abbott . " " Boy or girl ? " " Girl . " " And you 're the father ? "  | I nodded and she smiled at me . That 's what having a baby gets you , smiles from pretty women . She said I should follow her around the back and she tried to find a smock for me , but none came close to fitting . Finally , she decided just to drape a couple of them over my shoulders and she went away and came back with a baby wrapped up in a blanket . " Cecilia Abbott , " she said , and put the baby in my arms . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cecilia Abbott did n't look like her mother at all . She was pale in every way , with hair fair enough to be called white . It was impossible to believe she had been inside of Rose not an hour before , and now lived in the world without her . " Take her , " I said to the nurse , my voice shaking so that I surprised myself . " No sir , " the nurse said , and she laughed at me . " That 's your girl now , you best get used to holding her . " She led me over to a chair and sat us down . " Not so often we get a baby named quick as that , " she said . " Why , we got ones stay here for days , their tags just reading , Baby Girl Smith or Baby Boy Jones . That always makes me sad for some reason . Seems like a body should get named right off . " " Seems so , " I said , looking at my daughter . " Cecilia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like that . Looks like she 's pretty enough to be a Cecilia . " I looked up at her . " You think ? " The nurse ran one careful finger over the soft spot in the top of her head . " You bet , " she said . The nursery closed sharp at four o'clock , and all the babies were removed from the fathers . As soon as she was gone I missed her small weight , her tired face . I went to look in on Rose , but she was sleeping . Everyone was whipped , too big a day . So I went back to the window to say good-bye to my girl . I stood there with the grandparents , most of them younger than me , and waved because her eyes were open . She looked right at me , just for a second , but I swear to God she saw me there , and I loved her . It happened just that fast . It was so complete , so much love , that I realized that before that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my breath and felt myself getting taller . For the first time in my life I was glad to be so tall , because it gave me a better chance of protecting her . Something that small would need protection . I knew I could do that . All around me young women in pink terry cloth robes held  | the arms of young men , one of them wearing an army uniform , another a marine . They made faces through the glass and mouthed the words Mama and Daddy while they pointed to their chests . I saw myself in them . They were in love , too . All of us in love . " Which one 's yours ? " a boy said to me . He was probably nineteen or twenty , but looked younger on account of his being so thin . His skin was broken out all along his hairline . " That one , " I said , and pointed to the plastic box where she lay as still as a chicken egg . " Cecilia Abbott , " the boy read from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letters were big . " Well , she 's a cutey , all right , and she keeps good company , too . That 's my boy , right there in the crib next to her . " " Baby Boy Seidel , " I said . " I 'm thinking of calling him Elvis , " the boy said , and tapped at the glass lightly with his finger , until a nurse made a face at him from the other side and he stopped . I figured it up in the car on the way over . It had been twentyeight years since I last set foot in a tattoo parlor . And it was love that was making me go again this time , even though this time I was n't drunk and was n't seventeen and I was alone . But it was still Cecilia making me go , I am not a superstitious man . I did not believe Cecilia had come back to me in any way . This was for my daughter , a new girl , who happened to have her name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I sure was n't going to drive all the way to Fort Campbell for a small job like this . There was a place in Owensboro , a colored woman who did them in her house . It had been years since I had heard about her ; some guy drunk in a bar pulled up his pants leg to show me where he 'd had the skyline of Memphis tattooed above a scar he 'd picked up in World War II . I remember the buildings looked neat and orderly and that she 'd left the ragged red trail of the bullet to be the Mississippi . " Got a sign in her front yard , " the man said to me , running his finger over the rooftops like it was the first time he 'd noticed them there . Says TATTOO . Just like a NO HUNTING Ora FOR SALE , ' cept it says TATTOO . I always wondered where she found that damn sign . " There was nothing to say that she would still be there . I had met the man years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had Memphis with him , but people around these parts do n't tend  | to change much , unless of course they die . Sure enough , after driving around the other side of town for a while , I asked a colored boy out on his bicycle did he know about a woman did tattoos ? " Ma Mamie , " he said , and motioned for me to follow . It 's not easy , driving a truck slow enough to tail a boy on a bike . This boy , especially , as he did n't seem to be in any hurry to take me anywhere . We went up and down a few streets and then into an alley , where I saw the sign just as the man in the bar had described it . The boy was good to bring me to the door because it was getting dark and the place would have been hard to find otherwise . " Kid , " I called out my window . I wanted to give him a quarter , but he was sailing off over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . I parked the truck and got out . The way it was in Kentucky , in the South back then , was that going into a colored neighborhood was more or less like going into a whole other country . Your neighborhood could be on the edge , you could live three blocks or not even that , maybe just the distance of a field , be as close as from here to there , but the chances of you ever getting there , assuming your business was good , were about as much as you getting to California . Folks did n't mix , plain as that . There was no town meeting , no drawn-out line that said this is where you do n't cross , but there was an understanding , and all good folks , colored and white , abided by that . So when I had the opportunity to find myself on the other side , I looked around . That particular road was dirt and dark , but the snow on the ground spread around whatever light was left . I looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of chairs , a stack of empty bushel baskets , some firewood , maybe a flat of empty Coca-Cola bottles . I watched the curtains draw back , a face peer out and disappear . They wanted to know what a white man big as me was doing out in their road come nighttime , though it was clear enough whose house I was standing in front of . They wanted to let me know they 'd seen me , that if anything was to happen , they would have seen my face . It gets late so early in February , and I wanted to make it back to the hospital before visiting hours were over . I knocked on the door , and a girl , maybe fourteen , answered . She had to tilt her head back to see my face . " Yeah ? "  | " I 've come to see Ma Mamie , " I said . " You want a tattoo ? " I nodded my head . " You got money ? " I told her I did . With that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way for me to come inside . She was wearing jeans and a thin yellow shirt with the sleeves cut off . There were twisted yellow threads hanging down on her shoulders . Her hair was brushed back hard into a high ponytail that was braided tight . " What 're you gon na want ? " she said , and pointed to where I should sit down at the kitchen table . " The date , " I said . " Just today 's date . " " That 's four numbers and two dashes . That 's six bucks . You 're gon na have to put the cash on the table where I can see it . Lots of folks seem real interested in paying for what they want until they 've got it , if you know what I mean . " I nodded and put the money out on the table . I looked into the living room . There was a big console TV , a crucifix , an old divan . " I hope you do n't make a lot of noise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the back . He 's a security guard , works the night shift . " She went to wash her hands in the kitchen sink . " On thing he do n't like is being woken up before his time . Whera you gon na have this tattoo ? " " On my shoulder . " " Then take your shirt off , " she said . I started to unbutton my shirt and then thought better of it . did n't like the idea of taking off my clothes , any of my clothes in front of a child . " Where 's Ma Mamie ? " I asked . " I 'm Ma Mamie , " the girl said , not looking around . I covered up the six dollars on the table with my hand . " could n't be true , unless you were making tattoos when you we four . " She dried off her hands and brought out a big fishing tackle box from the pantry . " You may have been to my mother befo me . She was Ma Mamie , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her for her mama and on back like that . All of Mamies . When my mama died , I got the needles . That m me Ma Mamie . Take your shirt off . " I thought about it for a while . It just did n't seem right . " No , " I said . " I 'm good , " she said , screwing in the needle on the little electric drill . " All the Mamies are good . That 's because we  | learn from the time we 're born , right away . I did my first tattoo when I was eight years old , on my brother . I had to kneel on his chest to give it to him , but it 's there today , a little blue star , right there . " She tapped the space between her breasts . " It 's not half bad , either . If he was here I 'd have him show you . " " How old are you ? " " Twenty-one , " she said , and started to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like hell . " " Do n't you talk ugly to me , mister . " She did n't look up , but her voice was steady and low . " My pop is sleeping in the other room . I think you best bear that in mind . " Then all of the sudden she jerked her head up , like it 's all forgotten . " Time is money , " she said . " Yes or no ? " It was good and dark outside now , and I needed to get going . If there was another place that did tattoos in Owensboro , Id never find it before the end of visiting hours . I wanted today 's date put on today , not tomorrow . That seemed like cheating somehow . This was the day my daughter was born . I unbuttoned my shirt . " Okay , " I said . I pulled down the top of my overalls and took off my shirt and sat at the kitchen table of a fourteen-year-old colored girl whose father may or may not have been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Not very good work , if you do n't mind me saying . " " It was a long time ago . " " So where you want the date ? " I pointed just beneath her name . " Right there , " I said , and tapped the skin . " I can touch this one up , " she said , touching the name the way Rose did . " I can make it darker , prettier . It 'll look like new , only better . " " No , " I said . " Just leave that one alone . " " I can still do this good , " she said , her voice gone all dreamy . She started to wash my arm . " I 'll just make it look like it happened all on the same day , both tattoos . I 'll mix up a special ink so the new one 'll look faded to begin with . You wo n't be able to tell , not till all the scabs come off , but then you 'll see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time since I 'd come in the door I felt like this would be okay . " That would be nice , " I said . " Really nice . " " All us Mamies are pros , " she said . " Genetic . "  | I heard the hum of the needle and looked away . I do n't mind what happens , long as I do n't have to watch . It only took her a few minutes and she switched the needle off . " That looks good , " she said . She blotted up the extra ink with a little towel and let me see . Cecilia , 2-6-69 . It was good . " You want something else ? " " No , " I said . " You were right . You do a fine job . " " Come on and let me do something else . " She sounded girlish all of the sudden . She stood on one foot and twisted from side to side . " I would , but I 've got to get going . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a baby . " " How about just a little flower . I 'm real good at flowers . " " Roses ? Can you do a rose ? " " Like nobody , " Mamie said . " Then put a little rose there , under the date . That 'll be for my wife . " She changed her needles and flicked the switch on again . " You wo n't be sorry about this , " she said . " This is so pretty . " I felt the needle cut into my arm and thought about Rose and Cecilia , everyone there on my arm now , everyone included . " Almost done , " she said . " You 're being good , just keep holding still . " But just then a woman walked in the front door and let out such a yell that the needle bit deep into my arm and then fell to the floor . Mamie screamed and the woman screamed again and it was all I could do to keep quiet myself . " Goddamn you , girl , giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big woman , and her big wool coat and tall black fur hat and the two sacks of groceries in her arms made her seem all the bigger . Mamie stood behind me . " He was in a hurry , " Mamie said straight into my back . " He needed to get going . He could n't wait . " " What kind of a fool are you ? " she said , turning on me all of the sudden . " Letting a child give you tattoos ? Get out of my house ! Get out of my house ! " I pulled on my shirt and felt the blood on my arm soak through right away . " Do n't you want to see it at least ? " Mamie said to her mother . " I do n't want to see nothing . " " Im good , " she said . " Good as you . Good as you ev were . " I rushed past the Mamie at the door and wondered for a  | second if she had been the one who drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story was from a long time ago , and it had been her mother . But I did n't ask . I hurried outside and into my truck and turned on the heater because it always made such a racket and I did n't want to hear what they were saying anymore .  | BEFORE RosE there was Cecilia . She came before Saint Eliza-beth 's and Habit and my daughter . I was not a young man when I married for the first time : forty-five is better than half your life and the folks who know me would say I seemed older than that . But the first time I was in love I was young , young like I ca n't believe now , seventeen . Truth is , I was in love with Cecilia a long time before that . I used to say I was born loving her , on account of the fact I could n't ever remember meeting her . She is in the very first days of my memory . I can see her sitting beside me in Sunday school at the Lighthouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in the store with her mother , Mrs. Stewart , touching all the bolts of fabric she walks by . I see her at the Fourth of July picnic , not more than four years old , wearing a yellow dress that tied behind her neck and saying the Pledge of Allegiance . Not that I always remember her being a child . Lots of times I think about her when she was seventeen . I do n't think of her hardly at all anymore . It just got less and less over the years and now it 's been an awfully long time . There was a time if a man 'd told me I would be able to go an hour , much less a day or week , without thinking of her , I would have said he was crazy . But truth is , months go by and she wo n't even cross my mind . Even in the shower , or while I 'm getting dressed , and I know I must still see her name on my arm , I do n't see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It does n't tell me anything anymore . That 's one reason , although , God , there are so many I could barely list them , why I did n't want Rose to name our daughter Cecilia . I thought it would stir things up , that every day for the rest of my life I would hear that name , I would speak it myself whenever I called her in to dinner or sent her off to school , and  | it would remind me of what I had worked so hard to forget . But it did n't , really . It became my daughter 's name . When she was old enough to talk we would sit on the living room floor to try to get her to say Cecilia . " Ce-ci-li-a , " Rose would say , putting her face up near the baby 's and pointing at her . " Sissy , " Cecilia said , and tapped her chest . " Sissy come to Daddy , " I said , and opened my arms . She ran right into them , climbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my neck . " Do n't call her that , " Rose said , standing up . " It is n't her name . " " Well , it 's the one she likes , and I 'm siding with her . " I rolled onto my back and put Sissy up in the air . " Airplane , " I said . " Airplane , " she said . " Oh great , that one she gets . " Rose walked out of the room and left us there , making engine noises . Rose was a good mother . She fed the baby just the way the Spock book said she ought to . She never complained when she had to get up in the night . She dressed her warm . But there was something that nobody talked about that I think ate away at her . Sissy looked as adopted as any child to come out of Saint Eliz-abeth 's . She was blond curls and blue eyes and the doctor said she was in the lower range for size for her age . Her giant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little examining room . It did n't much bother me . For Sissy to be mine I had to make her mine , and I 'd done that . But for Rose it was all supposed to come natural . Sissy looked too much like whoever it was Rose 'd left behind , so in a funny way , it was more her that got reminded of the past than me . There was no one thing that made me think of Cecilia . I just did from time to time , for no reason in the world . She would come to me in a dream , sit beside me on the bed and hold my hand and talk to me . She was still seventeen and I would always feel ashamed to have gotten so old . Other times I 'd think I 'd seen her , just a flash of some woman turning the corner or driving a car that was so much her it made my heart stop . Then just as quick the woman would look up and I would see her with light on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things did n't happen much at all , but when they did , they shook me deep , and for a couple of days I 'd be nervous and want to  | keep to myself . I 'd remember the whole thing , beginning to end . It was like watching a movie you ca n't get out of . When we were seventeen , Cecilia loved me . At eight she loved me , ten she did n't , thirteen loved me , fourteen did n't . But when we were seventeen she said she 'd settled down . She was my girl , that 's the way we used to say it . I was only grateful . In the years Cecilia did n't love me , I felt paralyzed . It was like she 'd taken part of me , most of me , with her when she left . There was nothing for me to do but wait . " It 's over , " she 'd say , pulling her hair from the collar of her coat with one hand . All I could think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her hair . " Do n't , " she 'd say . Cecilia would tell people she was five three , but really she was n't a hair over five feet tall . She had a way of seeming bigger than she was , the way she walked with her head up and her shoulders back . Folks thought it was funny , me being so much taller than her . Course , then I was n't nearly as tall as I turned out to be . I was only six two . I had another growth spurt later , not too long after I left Ashland City , Tennessee , when I was eighteen . Cecilia did n't mind about me being so tall , though . If anything , it was what kept bringing her back to me . She loved to be carried . Once , when we were fifteen , we were watching a fireworks show down by the river and she could n't see , so I knelt down and she sat on my shoulder , just balanced there like a little bird . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other world , being up so far . If she could have had her way I know she would have had me carry her everywhere , but she was worried about how it was going to look , so we saved it for special times , like when it was raining and she did n't want to get her shoes wet or when we were coming home late from a dance and she was wearing high heels and her feet got tired . And always when we were alone , always when we kissed . She liked me to hold her up in my arms like a baby . She liked for me to reach down and pick her up and carry her someplace else , anyplace , so that when she opened her eyes everything was different . Cecilia said it made her feel like she was important , special . She said it was the reason she always came back to me . And I liked all of this just fine . Except that when I picked her up , when I held her , I could always feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was easy to forget . Cecilia was such a powerhouse , and do n't kid yourself about who was calling the shots on things . I was always half afraid of her ' cause in a funny way she was just so big , but when I picked her up she was of the  | earth , if you know what I mean . She was n't anything more than ninety pounds and I was the one who made every choice . It scared me , maybe because I could feel her as just a living thing , which meant it would be possible to lose her for good , or maybe I was afraid of hurting her somehow , like if I was to pick her up wrong I could break her accidentally . It 's the same way I felt with Sissy when she first came home from the hospital . I would just barely touch my palm to her chest and I could feel her little heart beating inside her and it felt so small it would make me want to put her down and run away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't , not with Sissy or Cecilia either . Folks that did n't know Cecilia very well all liked her , and the folks that did know her , like me and my family , liked her in spite of ourselves . She was sort of a silly girl , I guess . I can say that , looking back on things now . She 'd change her mind a million times and always say she was right , and she was way too proud , considering we were all more or less from the same stock . But somehow you just could n't hold it against her , like we all knew if we were her we 'd be feeling pretty good about it , too . My folks tried their best to hate her . Truth is , they got pretty tired of the whole thing , me being happy or sad depending on whether or not Cecilia was coming around . They wanted her to make up her mind . They wanted me to have a little peace . Every time she broke things off , my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potatoes . She 'd call it comfort food . " You 're better off rid of her , Son , " she said . " That girl 's never going to settle . She wants to keep you hanging on , that 's what she wants . You just ca n't give her the satisfaction . " I would just shake my head , trying to do what was supposed to come naturally : sit up , cut your food . I am forty-five . I have made it twenty-eight years in the world without Cecilia . But at seventeen it was impossible to think of a day without her . Whenever she came back , smiling and forgetful , my family loved her with me . They tried not to , but Cecilia held them almost the way she held me . They all fussed over her smallness , her bright hair , her pretty hands . She was friends with my sisters . She drank iced tea with my mother after school and looked through pattern books . We all felt Cecilia gave something to us , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our last year of high school , I was made fullback of the football team . It 's funny to think how much that mattered then , to me and Cecilia both . You never think about getting old when  | you 're seventeen . You never think about how it 's all going to turn out , that you 'll have a wife and a daughter and a job that takes up every waking hour . When you 're seventeen , there is n't anything past a good spot on the football team . In a small town , it was as close as you were going to get to being God . I was just so much bigger than any of the other kids . I doubled up and played basketball , too , but it was the football that everybody cared about . Folks said straight out I was the reason we won . Not just big , but fast too . Cecilia would say some days it felt like there was n't a place in town she could go where somebody was n't talking about me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about you , " she said . That was the kind of thing that made her happy , made her hold to my arm in a crowd , which made me happy . She would sit on my lap in the front seat of my father 's car late at night and let me kiss her , and I felt like nothing else ever needed to happen in the world . It would have been fine to stop everything right then . There was no other girl like Cecilia . There were girls who were prettier or less pretty , girls who were funny or bright , but at the heart of it , they were all the same , just like I was the same . In any crowd of people , Cecilia 's face would always be the first one you 'd see . It 's almost like everyone else was there to be around her , arranged in such a way to set off her eyes , her mouth . I 'm not even sure now that she was so beautiful , although then I thought she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big . She 'd built a momentum from being wanted by so many people , and the attention had made her kinder and meaner both . For a long time folks talked about the war in Europe , and what Ashland City said was that we should just tend to our own . There would be no point in Roosevelt going into that , though Lord knows we would have done whatever he told us to . But in December of 1941 , just as the football season was winding down , the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor and we all changed our minds . I left the house that Sunday without my coat , even though it was past freezing outside , and ran all the way to Cecilia 's . Her family was sitting around the radio . Her mother was crying . When Cecilia saw my face she jumped up and came over to me . Everything about her looked wound up , not so much scared , but like she wanted to go and fight herself . We went out into the kitchen and held hands and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me . I never will forget the look on her face at  | that moment . I remember everything , the dim light in the room , the long table , the yellow wallpaper with the green vines on it and the set of brass canisters along the counter and Cecilia wearing a pleated skirt and a pale pink sweater with a stitching of flowers around her neck and her hair was pulled back in a ponytail and her face was pure light . It 's just like a movie , a movie that does n't leave out one single thing . It was as if the Japanese had bombed downtown , and I told her I was going off to get them , right then , before they got to her street . " Then I 'll marry you , " Cecilia said . " As soon as you get back from training . We 'll get married and that way you 'll know I 'm waiting here . " It was settled just like that , without my asking . I did n't need to ask Cecilia to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her . Everything I did was by way of asking her to stay with me . " Then marry me tonight , " I said . " Or marry me first thing in the morning . " She smiled and touched the soft hairs on the back of her neck . " I ca n't get married tomorrow , silly , " she said . " I 've got to get bridesmaids . I 've got to get a wedding dress . I 'm not going to get married every day of my life , you know . " I leaned down and picked her up and she wrapped her arms around my neck and I put my arms around her back and I held her there , breathed in her smell and the smell of that pink sweater . Rose asked me if I loved the girl whose name is on my arm . She said I must have , that the name itself was proof , so yes , I loved her . At that minute , at night in her kitchen , holding her up off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything again in my life . I did n't want to wait for Christmas . I did n't want to finish out the end of the football season . The thought of graduating from high school seemed almost embarrassing , the sign of a man who did not love his country , or did not love Cecilia and want to finish basic training fast enough to get back and marry her . I enlisted the next morning , Monday , December 8 , in the United States Marine Corps . " You the boy 's parents ? " the sergeant said to my mother and father , who stood with me in the small office , which was crowded with boys I knew and their mothers and fathers . We had been in line for nearly an hour . My father said they were .  | " You 'll have to sign him over , then . Seventeen we need con-sent . " The sergeant handed my father a form , and my mother looked at me . " You 're sure about this , " she said , just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning in the car driving over . Her voice was n't nervous . It was n't that she thought my signing up was a bad thing , she just did n't want me to do it if I did n't want to . " Sure , " I said . I felt everyone waiting for us to get on with it . " Boy 's doing right , " my father said , and handed the form to my mother . " If I was a younger man . Hell , bombing Pearl Harbor . " " You 'll have to wait till the first of the year , " the sergeant said , pushing some papers toward us across his desk . " We 've got a crowd . " The three of us went out of the office , saying excuse me a dozen times just to get to the door . Outside in the bright December light we saw a line of boys snaking up the street and around the corner of the block . It looked like every boy in Tennessee was there . It made me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but then three days later they called and said there was room in Parris Island and that I should report in less than a week . I took the money I had saved and borrowed a little extra from my folks to buy Cecilia an engagement ring for Christmas . It was a nice diamond with a small blue stone set on either side , and when she opened the box , two weeks early , she jumped to her feet and kissed me . Everything was a promise that had yet to be made good on : I would go to war and we would win the war and Cecilia would marry me and we would be happy . I never separated them , either . One thing was the other , they ran together in my mind . But those few days between the attack on Pearl Harbor and the morning my father drove me to Nashville to catch the bus to Parris Island were the happiest I ever had . The news of the war filled every free second , and at seventeen it all seemed like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The war did something to Cecilia . She loved the whole idea of it , the soldiers and the broadcasts and the articles in the newspapers . I believe that during those few days Cecilia loved me in a way she had n't all the time we had been together before . I was going away and leaving her a war bride . It was the best thing she could have hoped for .  | Every time she showed her ring the girls would fall around her in a circle , ask her how she would be able to manage once I was gone . But even when I loved her the most , I always knew Cecilia would manage fine . " While you 're gone you 'll write me every day , " Cecilia said . " Every day . " " And you 'll think about me . You 'll miss me . " Cecilia pressed against me and shivered . It was nearly midnight and we were standing by the edge of the Cumberland River and it was snowing . It was my last night home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everything had changed since I enlisted . Our parents never asked us what time we 'd be home or where we were going . Everything we did was given a quiet blessing . " Pick me up , " she said . I picked Cecilia up in my arms and she put her head on my chest . Her hair looked so pretty , spread out against my dark coat . Her hair looked so pretty in the snow . " You know what my resolution is ? " she said . " What ? " I was only half listening . I was so full of looking at her , of feeling her chest go in and out against my chest while she breathed . " In 1942 I 'm going to be the best wife Son Abbott ever wanted , " she said , and then she looked up and smiled at me . I was trying to remember if I resolved to do anything , if there was anything I wanted , or wanted to be different . I could n't think of a thing . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front steps of my house , holding my mother 's hand . She had kissed me good-bye before , but when my father started to pull away , she came toward the car and he stopped . I rolled down the window and she leaned inside and kissed me again . " You 're not going to go off and forget me , are you ? " she said . But the question was so crazy that I did n't even answer her , I just ran two finger down along the side of her face . She was practicing for when I would go away to war . She was trying to get her good-bye just right . " You know your mother and I have always liked Cecilia , " my father said when we were a few miles from the house . " Not that we 've always wanted to . That girl 's given you a bad time over the years . But now that it 's all settled , I 'm glad about it . It 's clear enough how you feel about her . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If this is any sign of what kind of a wife she 'll be , you 're going to do just fine for yourself . " " Do n't I know it , " I said . I leaned my face against my hand , hoping there would be a little of her perfume left on my glove . All the way up I thought about her , not about the war , just that I had left her and now could set about coming back . There is n't much I remember about the first three weeks of boot camp , other than how much we were all the same . They shaved our heads first thing , stripped us down and gave us clothes . They looked in our ears and down our throats , weighed us in and measured us up against a wall . When they gave us our shots it was like they were making us even on the inside too , making sure we would all be sick at the same time , well together . I was good at doing what I was told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the left , I did it , never once went right just to see what it would be like . My folks told me what to do and always said I was a good son , did my chores without being reminded . After school I had a job at the seed feed store , loading bags into the backs of trucks . One hundred pounds of sweet feed for horses , one hundred pounds of corn , twenty-five pounds of rabbit chow for the Henleys , whose daughters kept rabbits as pets . They told me where to go and that bag was over my shoulder . I did my job . No one told me what to do more than Cecilia , to wait for her by the lockers after school , to drive her cross town to see Jeannie Allbrittan , to wave to her from the basketball court . To leave her alone . To come back to her . The marines had nothing on Cecilia . So I got up at four-thirty in the morning and showered and dressed like I was told . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an hour before breakfast . I memorized my rifle , knew it in the dark , took it apart and put it together again and loved it the way they told me to . It was a Springfield 0.3. , not what we 'd have later on , when the battles came , but what we had for now . I knew about guns from my father . I 'd shot deer with his Winchester since I was twelve . I was hoping for a beautiful gun , a good-looking pistol to wear on my hip . Where I came from , everybody had a rifle or a shotgun of some kind or another , but handguns , automatics or even old six-shooters , were pretty much just for the movies . I would say I was a good shot , but I had nothing on the boys in Parris Island . We were Southerners mostly , and lots of those boys had been hunting since they were seven or eight . They may have had a hard time making their beds just right , but they could  | shoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a .22 . In Parris Island , the way I shot was nothing special . All the guys in our company thought we would know each other forever , but the truth is I do n't know what became of a single one of them , and none of them would know that I became the groundskeeper at a Catholic home and married a pregnant girl and said her baby was my own . In quarantine we only had each other . We thought we would go to war together , fight together , come home together . We thought we would build our houses in the same towns and talk at night the way we talked now . Maybe it was because we looked so much alike , and everywhere I turned , there I was , sometimes fairer or heavier and always shorter , but it was me . Maybe it was because we had never been away before and we did n't know that you could live with someone and not treat them as family . I wondered sometimes if it was that we were scared , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I ca n't remember anybody who was smart enough to be scared . Now I 'm older , and I know enough to be scared of all sorts of things , things that are n't even there , things that could never happen . But back then it was all Hirohito and Hitler , like their armies were nothing more than football teams from other towns , and you do n't get scared of football teams , you just wait for your chance to go out there and lay them out in front of everybody . In the bunk under me was a guy from Chapel Hill named Dee . He had two older brothers in the navy who 'd already been shipped over to the Pacific . It was a big deal , Dee going with the marines . " Nobody expected me to , " Dee said , putting black polish on his boots and then brushing it off and then doing it over again . " But I just figured it was better , you know , spreading out a little . " I told him I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure likes you . " He winked at me and stuck his hand deep inside his boot . " You get more good-looking envelopes than anybody here . " " That 's my fiancee . " I tried the word out . " Cecilia . " " You getting married ? No kidding ? " " Before I get shipped out , one way or another . " " Sweet deal , " Dee said . " Guy ought to have a wife waiting for him when he 's off at war . I 'll tell you if there was anybody I liked , even a little , I 'd marry her in a minute . " " I like her just fine , " I said . It was a wonderful thing , to talk  | about Cecilia to someone who did n't know her , someone who had n't watched us grow up and seen her leave and come back like a seasonal bird . Dee thought I was doing her some kind of favor by marrying her . He did n't know how it was at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Blond or brunette ? Or God , she 's not a redhead is she ? " " Blond . " " Good thing she 's not a redhead . I have this thing for redheads . I might have to get on a bus to go and meet her myself if she was a redhead . " " Then she 's safe , " I said . " You got a picture ? " I put down my boot brush and wiped my hands carefully on the edge of a towel . I had a picture of Cecilia in my footlocker , in the little space for personal things we could keep . It was the same picture I 'd had of her for years , the one of her in her blue sundress . I looked at that picture so much I thought I 'd pull her off the paper . But then I just lost it somewhere . I never knew what became of that picture . " Here , " I said , and handed it to Dee . He took it by the corner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a little thing . God , what a doll . Hey , Jim , " he said , calling over to the guy in the next bunk . " Get a load of this . " Jim came over and took the picture . " Yours ? " he said to Dee . " Son 's . What do you make of that ? " Jim took the picture and showed it to his bunkmate , a guy from someplace in the Midwest , Illinois maybe , and from there it started to go around , up one row of bunks and down the other . Even when I could n't see it anymore , I could hear them saying our names , Son , Cecilia , whistling . Every guy wanting to be me , wanting to have Cecilia wait for him . Dear Cecilia , You do n't know it , but you are very popular in Parris Island . I 'm not the only one who dreams about you now . Your picture has been making the rounds and everyone agrees you are the prettiest girl we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is from Alabama came over to my bunk early this morning before inspection and asked could n't he please see your picture again . I guess I 'll have to be very careful now , so many guys who want to know where you are .  | have a girl to send a present to , any girl . I picked out a scarf with red flowers around the edge . " If you want to write a note for that and give me the address I could just mail it for you , " the salesgirl said . " If you want , that is . " " That would be good , " I said . I thought about it for a minute and then wrote something down and handed it to her . She was a pretty girl , slim and dark-haired . I thought if she was all fixed up she would have looked a little like Ava Gardner . " Would you like to go for dinner tonight ? " she said , keeping her eyes down on the counter as she wrote out the receipt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of the guys had heard her . " I ca n't , " I said quietly , " I 've got a girl . " I tapped the scarf on the counter . She looked up at me . Her eyes were brown . " Here ? " she asked . " No , Tennessee . " " So do you want to have dinner with me tonight ? " She started to smile , but then looked away , like all of the sudden she 'd lost her nerve about the whole thing . I felt bad for her . She was a pretty girl . I wondered then if that 's what it meant to be in loye , turning down invitations from pretty girls when you were away from home . I thanked her for everything and we left . It was cold and snowing a little bit and we pushed our hands into our pockets and headed down the street toward no place in particular . " I say we have dinner , " Jim said . Dee looked at his watch . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too early to start drinking now . If we wait and have dinner later , it 'll just cut into our drinking time . " Jim was a sensible guy . He could always figure out how to do something , fix an engine or tighten his blankets to make a quarter bounce . If he said dinner was a good idea , then chances are it was . We were seventeen . We were always hungry . By the time we 'd eaten it was getting dark , and we figured we could raise any sort of hell we wanted . The first bar we went into a couple of guys bought us a round of beers and we took this as good luck . Sam and Perry shot pool while Dee and Jim and I split a pack of cigarettes . It 's not that I 'd never had a drink . I 'd done some drinking in my day , but that was the first time it did n't matter . I was n't breaking any rules , there was no worry in the back of my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting up for me in the living room . Now 1  | was a marine out with my marine friends and I could drink what I wanted . " You should see this guy 's girlfriend , " Sam said to the bartender , and put his arm around my shoulder . " Great big guy like this and he has this little bitty girlfriend . " He held up his thumb and forefinger about an inch apart . " This big . And pretty . " He shook his head . " Who ? " Jim said . " Cecilia . Son 's Cecilia . " , " To Cecilia , then , " Jim said , and raised his glass , and the whole bar raised their glasses and looked up and said , " To Ce-cilia , " and we all whooped and hollered . The bartender filled us up again and we started talking about getting over to the Pacific to show those guys what for . Then just when we were all starting to feel a little lonely , the salesgirl who liked Dee came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our table and sat right down next to Dee and kissed him on the cheek . Suddenly I missed my salesgirl and remembered her as looking more and more like Ava Gardner . " Betty , " she said to Perry and shook his hand . She shook hands with all of us and asked us where we were from . Then someone put a song on the jukebox and she got up to dance with Dee , even though there was n't really a dance floor . Jim and Sam and Perry and I watched them like they were a movie . We were all drunk , but Dee was drunk and dancing . Then a guy around sixty came over and sat down with us and bought everyone a round of drinks . " I was a marine myself , " he said when we raised our glasses to him . " The Great War . Hell of a war . " We nodded . " What 's that on your hand ? " Perry said . He probably would n't have asked that way , except that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of our mouths . The man , who said his name was Louder , rolled up his shirt sleeve and showed us a snake that went all the way around his forearm . I could tell by the yellow and brown on its back and the diamond shape of its head that it was supposed to be a cottonmouth . Its red tongue was out , lying on the top of his hand . I wondered why anyone would want a cottonmouth on his arm . " This one 's basic training , " he said , tapping the snake on the head . " I got plenty others , but I 'm not going to take my shirt off . It 's too damn cold in here . You know what they say , ca n't be a marine without a tattoo . " And that was all we needed to hear , because nobody was  | going to tell us we were n't marines . We were all out of our chairs and on our feet . I went to get Dee . " We 're going for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But Dee only pulled Betty closer and pushed his face into her hair . " You crazy ? " " Marines have tattoos , " I said . " Are you a marine or what ? " " I 'm a dancing marine . " They did a sloppy half turn so that all of the sudden I was facing Betty . She gave me a wink . I was n't sure what it was supposed to mean . " We 'll go without him , " I said to the others . " Without Dee ? " Sam said . " It 's either that or no tattoos . " I downed the last of my drink and then the last of Dee 's drink , which he had left sitting on the table . It served him right . " You boys know where to go ? " Louder said to us when we were almost to the door . We stopped , looked back , shook our heads . He pulled himself into his coat and got to the front of the line . " Come on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to stay and watch . I never watch a tattoo . Not even my own . " It was nearly midnight , but Louder said the place stayed'open late . " I ought a get a commission , " he said . It was n't too far from the bar , and I was glad since the cold was starting to creep up under my coat . There was a sign in the window that said , TATTOOS WHILE YOU WAIT . It was lit up like a soda shop , fall of guys I knew and guys from other companies , all as drunk as me . They all said hello and tried to make room for us on the edges of chairs . The place smelled like rubbing alcohol , like gin . " None of you planning on throwing up , are you ? " a small , burly man said to us when we came in . We shook our heads . " Well if you are , go outside . " He took a silent count of heads . " It 's gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Jim said . The man handed us books so we could pick out what we wanted . When his sleeves rode up above his wrist we caught sight of the edge of a world , the tails of things hanging down beneath his cuffs . He called for the next fellow in line to come behind the curtain . Louder looked around . " Just like the old days , " he said . I was more sure than ever that this was the thing to do , what with so many of the guys there doing it . A fellow named Pinsky whose bunk was near the front of the Quonset hut stepped out  | from the back , buttoning his shirt . " They 've got three guys working back there , " he said . " You wo n't have to wait too long . " " Hurt much ? " I asked him , and then was sorry because the question did n't sound very marine . He looked at me , his eyes glazed over from bourbon or something else . " You bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a coat . Jim and Perry went back first , Jim for an eagle with a flag twisted in his talons and Perry for a snake like Louder 's , which seemed to make Louder happy . He stayed with us after all and talked about something that I could n't quite hear . I was thinking about my tattoo , which would say Cecilia . I picked out the kind of letters I wanted . I thought of how happy she would be to see her name there , on my arm like it was on most every tree and park bench in Ashland City . I had carved it in so many places that it was almost a joke in town , every tree named Cecilia . When a very short man with smooth black hair and a careful little mustache called me back I told him what I wanted . " Big or small ? " he said . There was no interest in his voice . There was talk that they 'd done more than a hundred and fifty tattoos since liberty began that afternoon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . " Pretty big , " I said , " from about there to there . " I marked out the place on my arm and he started to wash it off . " Write it down , " he said , and gave me a pencil and paper . " I do n't want to make a mistake . My spelling 's not so good . " So I wrote down her name on a piece of paper and held it up with my other hand while he worked . After every letter he finished , he checked it again . His hand shook a little while he worked the electric needle , probably just from being so tired . When it was done I looked at it and for the first time I felt married , like the whole ceremony was done and Cecilia was mine . " That 's good , " I said to the tattoo man . My voice seemed to startle him , almost like I woke him up . " Yeah ? " he said . " You think ? " He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's not bad , really . " I tipped him a dollar over the price and went back out into the waiting room . Jim and Perry were finished , but Sam was still getting worked on , so I sat down and waited with the rest of them . I was starting 4  | to sober up a little and was sorry for it . I could feel a sting in my arm that I had n't before . Then Sam came into the waiting room with his shirt off . He was still as drunk as he 'd been in the bar . He was smaller than the rest of us , but he 'd kept up . It must have hit him harder . " Look at this , " he said , and turned his shoulder toward us . That tattoo was a little red , but it was clear enough from where we sat . Jim and Perry started to howl. - It said Cecilia . " You son of a bitch , " I said , and I went for him across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and white tile floor , the pictures of tattoos taped to the wall , turned into a blur . There was just no stopping me , though I guess a few people tried . I was a fullback and I moved through the room of would-be marines like water and got to Sam . It was like somebody just handed him to me , and I had him by the shoulders and up in the air . I can still see his face above my face . It was pale and red and a little broken out . His blue eyes were rimmed with water and there was a pain and fear I had n't seen before . " My arm , " he said , crying . " My arm . Put me down . " But I did n't put him down as much as throw him down , through the curtain and onto the table where someone I did n't know was having the word America carved into his chest . The tattoo man I 'd tipped five minutes before looked at me like someone he 'd never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Shore Patrol , " the burly man said . " Stupid , drunk bastards . " So then I went for him , hating him exactly the way I had hated Sam a minute before . All I wanted to do was fight , that quick I 'd gone crazy , seeing her name like she was the one who put it there . Jim took hold of my arm and so I turned to go for him , but when I saw his face he said , " Son , hey . Son , " and I heard him . " We need to get out of here now , " Jim said . Perry went and picked up Sam and helped him into his shirt . We were all so good at getting dressed quick in those days , and the four of us were out the door , and it was all forgotten . We were running together , stumbling half blind and laughing at what , I ca n't imagine . I never saw Sam 's tattoo again . The next morning was a hell that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same as ever , four-thirty wake-up , four-fortyfive run . Each beer and whiskey was with us as we went through our course . And nobody 's arm felt like lifting a field pack either .  | ber . I told him I 'd walk my post in a military manner . I told him the whole thing . " At ease , " he said . These were the sweetest words in the language back then . It meant that things were going to be all right . I took a step to the side and looked at him . " Corporal of the guard come to smoke , " he said , and tapped a Camel out of his pack and lit it . " Not too bad out here to-night . " " Sir , no , sir . " " Anything to report ? " " Sir , no , sir . " He probably was n't more than nineteen or twenty , but on that night he was so far my superior that I could n't imagine we could have gone to high school together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and blew the smoke straight up . Bill Lovell was his name , I remember that . I waited and tried not to watch him , thinking he would finish his cigarette and go on , but he seemed to make it last and when he was finished , he lit another one off its end . He took the one that was done and fieldstripped it , flicking off the burning end , scattering the tobacco , and rolling what paper was left into the smallest ball you could imagine . " You smoke , Abbott ? " " Sir , yes , sir . " " Well then , have a smoke with me . " He took a cigarette from his pack , lit it , and handed it to me . I ca n't describe this so that it would make any sense to someone who had n't been there , but this was just short of a miracle ; the corporal of the guard giving me a cigarette at my post . I took it and thanked him . " Where you from , Abbott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir . " " Never heard of it . " " Sir , no , sir , " I said . I wanted to ask him where he was from , how long he 'd been there , but I did n't want him to think that if he gave me a cigarette I 'd take it as a sign that I could do anything I wanted , so I just kept quiet and enjoyed the smoke . He looked around the camp . It must have been three in the morning . Nothing was moving , nothing awake . Then he looked at me . " It sure would be a shame if you had to shoot anybody with that weapon , " he said . " Springfield was fine in the Great  | the gun out and it discharged . He had hit the grip safety and the trigger at the same time . I heard the loud crack and smelled the sharpness of the gunpowder before I felt it . The round went into my left knee with such force it knocked my leg clean out from under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there was a sound of all my breath coming out of my lungs and Billy Lovell looked at me for that second and I looked at him and we knew , that in different ways , it was all over for both of us.  | MOTHER CORINNE never liked it , Rose staying on and working in the kitchen the way she did , but Rose just would n't go . It was n't three days after Sissy was born that she just bundled her up and took her into breakfast . I went over with her . " You do n't need to do this , " I said . " You should have some rest , stay home with the baby . You do n't need to be working . " But she did n't even look up at me . She was putting diapers in her overnight bag and trying to find her scarf . We went in together through the back door . Once we got there I knew why she was doing it . Sister Evangeline lit up like a Christmas tree . The second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her hands pulling at her rosary . " Lookee , " she said . " Oh , Mother Mary , lookee at this one here . " She wrapped her arms around Rose and put her head down next to the baby , kissing her . " I never get the babies , " she said , not stopping to wipe her face . " All the girls come here and I can see so much promise , but then everybody goes away . I 've tried not to mind , but now I can tell you , I do . Every one of them I miss . " " Im here , " Rose said . " I was n't sure . I mean , I was sure , everything in me said this baby was going to stay , but then I thought maybe I just wanted it so bad , maybe I was trying to will it so . I got confused . " She smiled at me , standing over near the door . " Old women . You know me , Son . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because then I knew it was the truth . " I tried to get her to stay at home , but she would n't have it . " " Well , you should stay at home . " She reached up and slapped Rose a couple of times on the cheek , too hard , I thought . " You should be in bed . " But the joy in her voice said very clearly ,  | You 're fine , you should be right here . " They sent me a new girl when you left . Penny . Sweet girl , but she 's no Rose . I 'd forgotten how to cook with you around . All those years of doing everything and now I ca n't boil an egg . And Penny , sweet girl , she ca n't do a thing , either . I was starting to think I 'd be out on the streets , an old nun looking for work . But you 're hungry , all of you . You , " she said , and touched Sissy 's nose . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You sit down , " Rose said , and dropped the baby in her arms like she was tossing a handbag on the sofa . Sister Evangeline and I both took on the same panicked look . " I 'm going to make breakfast . " " Well , what am I going to do ? " Sister Evangeline said . " Take care of Cecilia , I guess , " Rose said , and went to tie an apron on . " I do n't know about babies anymore . " " You know more about them than I do , " Rose said . Then she set about her job , just like nothing had happened . She took out the bowls and the eggs and the flour , the cups and spoons . She forgot about us , or at least tried very hard to look like she had . I ate the plate of pancakes she set before me . " I need you to take the baby over to June , " Rose said to me . " June ? " " She 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the day . " " I thought you 'd keep her here . " Rose shook her head . She kept on cooking . With Rose it was always a meal for twenty-five . " I do n't want her around here . In fact , I want her out before the girls start waking up . It 's too hard for them to see a baby . Believe me , I know what I 'm talking about . " " But how 's June gon na feel about this ? " I said . Sister Evangeline had the baby and was bouncing her up and down . " I called her and worked it all out . She 's thrilled . You know June . She 'd love to have the baby around . " " I talked to her , too , " Sister Evangeline said . " She can hardly wait . " I stewed for a minute . I did n't like it , the baby not being with Rose . I did n't like not knowing either . I was the father . That ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going , " Rose said to me . " Girls will be up any minute . " I leaned over and took my daughter out of Sister Evangeline 's arm . Such a tiny bundle . Such a little round weight . I wanted  | You 're fine , you should be right here . " They sent me a new girl when you left . Penny . Sweet girl , but she 's no Rose . I 'd forgotten how to cook with you around . All those years of doing everything and now I ca n't boil an egg .

" I leaned over and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tiny bundle . Such a little round weight . I wanted  | to keep her with me but there were so many things to do . I was the one with the paying job in the family . " All right , " I said . " But we 'll talk about this later . " When I got to the door Rose stopped me . I thought that maybe she could n't stand it now that she was watching her go . " Son , " she said . I turned to her . Sissy was asleep like an angel . " Take the diaper bag . " I carried the baby over the pasture to June 's house . It was cold and I kept trying to keep her head covered up without smothering her . Who would have thought I 'd be walking across this pasture with a baby ? My baby . The bag of bottles and soft clothes swung from my shoulder . My daughter slept and woke , twisting up her mouth as she watched the sky pass over her head . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steps June threw open the door , fully dressed . " Well , let me see this , " she said , and stretched out her arms . I gave Sissy over to her and she just could n't get enough of it . I thought she 'd push the baby clean into her chest . " Son Ab-bott , " she said . " If I had known the day I met you what good things you 'd bring to my life , I would have taken a mind to marry you myself . " " You 're smarter than that , " I said . " Not smarter , " she said . " Just too old . God , will you look at this one ? All my life I thought a baby would come to me . Just did n't count on it taking so long . " She stepped inside the house , and I saw a bassinet set up in the living room , right in the center of things where June could keep an eye on her all day . She did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems like an awful lot of bother for you , " I said . " Do n't be a fool . " I sat down on her sofa , made myself to home for a minute . " If you ask me , it 's Rose who should be doing this . There 's no point in her going back to work . " " The point is that she wants to . If she was n't meant to stay at home it would only wind up worse in the long run . She told me on the phone , it 's only while this one 's real little . It 's hard for those girls , seeing new babies when they 're so close to having one of their own . It 's confusing . Once some time goes by and things settle down , she can stay over with Rose during the day . " " I do n't like it , " I said . " Well , " June said , running her finger along my daughter 's cheek . " I do . " I stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on  | things , but everybody seemed happy as larks . Once I went by and found Sister Evangeline there , changing Sissy 's diapers on the kitchen table . " Everything else in the world gets modern , " she said to me . " Babies stay just the same . " I thought a lot about the two of them , both past sixty and finally getting to have a baby of their own . I was glad for them . I could see it was no burden . But still , I wished it was n't my baby they had . At the end of the day Rose and I went over to June 's and took Sissy back . June acted like we were tearing her heart out of her chest . " She 'll be back in the morning , " June said . " First thing , " Rose said . June watched us walk back toward our house beside the hotel . " This is n't right , " I said to Rose , Sissy fussing a little in my arms . " Leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I feel sure Cecilia got more attention today than most children get in a lifetime . " " I just do n't like it , " I said . She stopped in the snow , halfway between Saint Elizabeth 's and our house . We looked at each other in the darkness . The stars behind her head looked like a decoration for Rose . " I 'm tired , " she said quietly . And I did n't say , see there , I told you ; and I did n't say , that 's what you get ; I said , come on then , let 's get you home . The next morning when I was on the second floor finishing up work on a sink , flat on my back and staring up at the curved underside of a washbowl , Mother Corinne came in . " Son , " she said . " I wo n't have this . " I sighed , sat up , and wiped my hands . I 'd gotten good at being careful not to hit my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She 's not a resident anymore . She should n't be here . " " She 's my wife now , Mother . " " Then she should stay at home as your wife . Im none too pleased about the way all of this went . It was n't the time to talk to you before , but I 'll have you know this is a great disappointment to me . I trusted you , Son . If I 'd known you were going to be picking out girls for yourself I would have dismissed you years ago . " I stood up , because Mother Corinne used her size to bully  | people . " Since we both know that 's not so , I think it best we just do n't get into it . " She flushed a little bit . " The point of this conversation is your wife 's continuing to work in our kitchen , which is unsatisfac-tory . The thing you had to do if you were going to deal with Mother Corinne was forget about her being a nun . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff , took all her guff for years because she was supposed to be a woman of God . You had to deal with her as straight as she dealt with you , or you were dead in the water . " The way I hear it told , the food went downhill fast with Rose gone . Sister Evangeline ca n't do it anymore . She has n't been able to for years , and she ca n't have a different girl coming and going for each meal . She needs someone to look after her , and she wants that someone to be Rose . As for my feelings , I 'd tend to agree with you . She 's not getting paid and she 's working like a horse , which do n't make much sense to me . I 'd say we should all be thankful for what 's set before us . " Mother Corinne mulled on this for a minute . She was not one to set her teeth so far into something that she could n't let go when presented with the truth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she 's not asked to be here , but if she wants to help , for a while , " she said , " then I suppose that could be arranged , but her daughter will have to stay at home . This is no place for children . Surely even you would be able to understand that . " " I understand that fine , " I said . " Sissy is staying with June Clatterbuck . " " Then this conversation is concluded , " she said . " Except for this : when you want to get rid of Rose , you go tell Rose . Not me . " I turned the cold water faucet . Water came out . " Fixed it , " I said . Mother Corinne nodded toward the sink and left me there . I did n't scare her and I did n't try to . We 'd been around each other for so long and we both admitted , at least to ourselves , that we were dependent , me on the work and her on the worker . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from anybody , and if you tried to tell her what to do , chances were she was going to tell you to go to hell . Sissy was pure joy , as smart and loving a child as God 's made . Being around so many people while she was growing up made her friendly . " Children are like pups , " Sister Evangeline told me . " The  | more people picking them up and playing with them , the more people they 'll grow up liking in their life . " By the time she was three she 'd started coming over to Saint Elizabeth 's for lunch , and when she was four she was pretty much around all the time . It happened gradually , so that even Mother Corinne was used to her . She still went over to June 's every day , but it was almost like she was too busy to spend the whole day with one person . All the girls wanted their time with her . They wanted to brush her hair and read her stories . They wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get to be mothers in their own right . At the hotel she was the center of the world , and it made her sweet , where another child might have turned spoiled . With all the excitement that came from spending her days at Saint Elizabeth 's , Sissy must have found the evenings dull , two quiet parents and a little house . Her mother read cookbooks at the kitchen table , or did a little straightening up . I used to wonder if Sissy would forget who her mother was , with so many mothers . Once or twice I caught the girls trying to get her to say Mama to them . But Sissy knew . If she fell and scraped her knee , it was Rose she ran to crying , and if she painted a picture she was proud of , it was Rose she wanted to see it first . And Rose would always turn down the flame under the pot she was working on and listen to her for a minute or pick her up under one arm to wash out her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be running in the halls , " she would say matter-of factly , not scolding , but just passing something along . " That 's how these things happen . " Sissy would sniff a little and touch her cut lightly . " Do n't touch it , " Rose said . " That 's why I washed it in the first place . " She got out the small first-aid box she kept near the stove and put a Band-Aid on . " Repaired , " she said and lifted her off the counter and put her down on the floor , but Sissy held on to her neck like clinging ivy . " Come on now , your mother has to work . " " Kiss . " " Okay , kiss . " Rose kissed her . " Now scoot , go scare the nuns . " " Kiss . " " Kisses do n't grow on trees , you know . I 've got to get to work . " She kissed her again , quickly this time . " Out of here . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole stream of girls who waited to see her Band-Aid and kiss her for it . 1 THE PATRON SAINT OF LIARS 161  | Rose just never seemed to have much time for Sissy . Every last thing , from a chicken in the oven to the sad story of one of the girls , came first . One night we were lying in bed , not sleeping , and since it was what I was thinking about , I finally asked her . " Why did you keep Sissy ? " " What do you mean ? " she said , tired , her thoughts someplace a long way from that bed and that night . " Why did you go through everything to keep her ? Why did n't you just let her go like all the other girls do ? " She sat up on one elbow and stared at me . " What an awful thing to say . Cecilia 's my daughter . I kept her because she was mine . " " But you were n't going to keep her . I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wanted to give her up and then you did n't , you married me , you stayed here , and now it all does n't seem to matter very much , and sometimes I wonder why you did it , is all . I just keep thinking , it could n't be because you wanted to spend the rest of your life cooking at Saint Eliz-abeth 's , or even because you wanted to take care of Sister Evangeline . Those are good things , but they just are n't enough , not to change so many lives around . Do n't look at me like that , Rose . All I 'm saying is , I wonder , that 's all . " Rose got out of . the bed . " I ca n't believe you , " she said . She pushed her hands through her hair . She 'd gotten thin in the last couple of years and it made her face sharper and so beautiful I could hardly believe it sometimes . " Are you not happy ? " " No , I never said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A tightness came up in my throat . " Oh , Rose , Jesus , you know I love you . And Sissy . Dear God . That 's not what I meant . " " This is what I 'm supposed to do : be married , raise my daughter , do my job . This is my life . " She was slapping her hand against the bedpost , punctuating every word with a slap . " I do n't know how to do this another way . " " I 'm sorry , " I said . " I 'm sorry . Come back to bed . " " No , " she said . She stood in her nightgown by the window , shivering . " Please . I was wrong to say it . I never should have brought it up . " " You think I do n't love her . Well , to hell with you . " She took her pillow off the bed . " I 'm going to sleep with Cecilia . " She  | went into the living room and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in half my life . I could still feel her warmth in the blankets . The next morning Sissy was in heaven . All the way to Saint Elizabeth 's she held Rose 's hand . " Mommie slept with me last night , " she told me for the fifth time . Rose had braided her hair . She almost always waited and let Sister Evangeline braid her hair . " And Mommie 's going to sleep with me tonight , " she said . " We 'll see , " Rose said . I did love Rose . I loved her strength and her pride . I loved the way she just got things done and never cared what anybody else might think about it . I loved the look that came over her face when she helped Sister Evangeline up from her chair or when she talked to one of the girls or when she closed her eyes and prayed . I loved the feel of her body beside me in bed at night and the way she brushed her hair without looking in the mirror and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hoped that she would stay with me in Habit for the rest of our lives , but I could do without her . What I mean is , I could conceive of that loss , life with no Rose . It would be a terrible thing , but I had lived through losing a woman before and if it happened I could live through it again . It was Sissy I flatly could not do without . The love for a woman and the love for a child are not the same thing . With a woman , there 's always the sense that they 're loaning themselves to you . You have to remember that they could go at any time , and if a man 's smart he never forgets that . He 's just grateful for every minute she 's there . But a child you come to expect . Their love is so much like breathing that it 's a part of you , a leg , a lung . The look on Sissy 's face whenever I came into the room was something I now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my neck , the way she called for me when she was scared in the night . After she was born I never thought about her father again because in the center of my bones I was her father and no one will ever tell me that me being the one to make love to Rose nine months before Sissy 's birth would make me any more so . When new girls came to Saint Elizabeth 's and said , Who are you ? What is your name ? she always said , Cecilia Abbott . That 's who she was . Abbott . Mine . I could n't see how Rose could be more of a parent than me . Did n't I rock her to sleep ? Did n't I tell her stories and show her the woods and buy her penny candy in town ? Did n't I love her with my whole life ? That one night Rose slept with Sissy was the only time she  | threatened to take her away from me . As mad as she was , I think she saw it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even if Rose did n't love me , she did n't hate me either . There were always so many girls coming and going , I never knew how they kept a balance . Every time a girl went off to Owensboro , a new one appeared at the door , flat-stomached , suitcase in hand . When one would disappear , sometimes Sissy would think to look for her . " Where 's Stella ? " she would ask her mother . " She 's gone off to have her baby . " I do n't know . I 'm old-fashioned . I did n't like a four-year-old having to spend every day thinking about who was having babies and where they came from . I 'd get flustered when Sissy would ask me why everybody had a baby but us . Rose , on the other hand , was n't bothered by anything . " Why do they have to go away when they have the baby ? Where 's the baby then ? " " In the hospital , " Rose said , pinching in the edges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tart . Nothing was a plain old pie with her anymore . " The baby lives in the hospital ? " " No , " Rose said , " the baby goes home to its parents . " " Then why do n't they come back ? " " This is n't their home . This is just a place girls go to get ready to have a baby . Like a chicken sits in a nest . This is the big nest for pregnant girls . " Sissy thought about it for a while . " But we live here all the time . " " That 's because I 'm the keeper of the nest , " Rose said . " If I went away , nobody would get dinner . " Sometimes , if it was somebody Sissy especially liked , she would sulk for an hour or two once she realized that girl was gone , but she always got over it . There were so many girls in the world . Just before Sissy 's fifth birthday , a girl named Alice came to Saint Elizabeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , the very first day Alice arrived . There were many girls over the years that Sissy fixed herself to , and because Alice was the first , we used the name to mean anyone Sissy loved . " I think this one 's an Alice , " we would always say when Sissy came in , talking a mile a minute about some girl who had just arrived . It would be hard to say exactly why Sissy settled on Alice , the first Alice . Maybe it was because she was getting older and she did n't want  | to spend her days with so many different people anymore . Sissy was at a point that she needed one mother , and since her own mother was n't available , and she was getting too big for Sister Evangeline and June to pick up anymore , Sissy chose Alice . There was nothing so out of the ordinary about Alice . She was more of what they called a hippie girl than most that came through . She wore her blond hair long and straight with bangs that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beads around her neck which Mother Corinne was quick to talk her out of . But it was 1973 by then , and we were used to seeing all kinds , not like the old days when the girls were all nervous and well mannered . Once the sisters had given her some clothes and talked her into combing back her hair , she looked a lot younger than you would have thought at first . Whenever I saw her , I would think to myself that she was somebody 's daughter . That was the kind of look she had . It was Sissy who introduced us to her . I was in the kitchen , having lunch with Rose and Sister Evangeline after everybody else had eaten . Sissy came in holding Alice 's hand . " There 's my big girl , " Sister Evangeline said . " Where 's my kiss ? " Sissy came over and kissed her . " This is my friend Alice , " she said , grabbing hold of Alice 's hand again . " Nice to meet you , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair that was over next to the walk-in . I noticed that she had on the same old blue cotton dress Rose was wearing the first day I saw her standing on the porch drinking tea . It was big on Alice , and she had an old cardigan sweater wrapped around herself . Seeing that dress again made me feel so in love with Rose that my face turned red . I wondered if she would remember it , but it was n't like Rose to remember something like a dress . Sister Evangeline said hello , and Rose got up to get Alice a cup of coffee from the stove . " Alice is my best friend , " Sissy said . " Right ? " she asked . " You bet , " Alice said . Sissy got out of her chair and sat in Alice 's lap . " Cecilia , " her mother said . " Do n't climb all over people like they were furniture . " " She 's all right , " Alice said , and looped an arm around her waist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I look just like Alice . "  | We all looked at the two of them , sitting there together . " You do , " Sister Evangeline said . " Now that you mention it , you do . " Alice is from Katie 's , " Sissy said . " Cadiz , " Alice said . " But she lives here now , " Sissy said . Alice bounced her knees up and down a couple of times . " You bet . " " When did you get in ? " Rose said . " Just last night . It took me longer to get here than I thought it would . I should n't have come so late . " She smiled at Sissy and tickled her side a little to make her squirm . I liked Alice . She seemed more like she 'd just come into the Hotel Louisa than Saint Elizabeth 's . It was almost like nobody had told her that this was a home for unwed mothers and she was there because she was one of them . If she felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . " I 'm going to show you the lookout now , " Sissy said , and jumped onto the floor . The lookout was a balcony off one of the third-floor suites . It gave you the best view of Habit for your money . " Maybe Alice is n't finished having coffee , " Rose said . Alice took another sip and put down her cup . " Now Im finished , " she said to Sissy . " It was nice meeting everyone . I 'm sure we 'll see plenty of each other . " " The kitchen is the place to be . If you ever need anything , " Sister Evangeline said , " why , you just come to the kitchen . " She leaned out and patted Alice on the hip . " I will , " Alice said , and got up to leave . " Did you have your interview with Mother Corinne yet ? " Rose said . Alice smiled . " That 's why I 'm dressed like this . " " I never get to girls in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sister Bernadette to bring everyone in here first . Did she give you a hard time ? " " Nothing much . " " I hope you did n't tell her your husband died . " " What ? " " When she asks what happened to the father , everybody says they were married but their husband died in a car crash . " " Really ? " Alice said . She tilted her head to one side and gave a small shrug . " I just told her it was none of her business . "  | Alice was good for Sissy , she settled her down . Other girls passed her around , mothered her for a spell and then let somebody else have a chance , but when Sissy spent time with another girl now , it was clear that she was just on loan from Alice and should come back as soon as possible . " Alice and me are going to Egypt , " Sissy said one night when I was tucking her into bed . " Egypt , " I said . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sissy said . " That 's how we like it . " " Wo n't you miss your old dad ? " She thought about it for a minute . Sleep was dragging down her eyes . " Yep , " she said dreamily . It was Alice who started teaching Sissy how to read , even though she already knew the alphabet . She taught her how to tell time and cut snowflakes out of sheets of paper . I wondered at what point it would all start to bother Rose , since all Sissy had to say anymore was Alice this or Alice that , but she did n't seem to notice . It was all the same to her , one girl or two dozen girls paying attention to her daughter . But it worried me . Rose would say , everything worries you . " Is it dead ? " Alice asked me . She was standing down under a sycamore tree I was sawing on . " Naw , just a little bit . Lightning hit it , here . See ? Mother Corinne 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree 'll fall on their head or something , so I just go ahead and saw the branches off right away . Do n't really need to , though , nobody comes all the way out here . " " I do , " Alice said . " I guess you do . " It was a nice day , too nice for March . Spring had come on early and strong and stirred everything up . It was n't even the end of the month and there were daffodils . You could count on it , sometime in April it would snow and kill everything off . That 's the way it worked in Kentucky . " Where 's your shadow ? " I asked her . " Cecilia 's asleep . Out like a light . I 've never seen a kid who sleeps that hard . " " She sure is crazy about you , " I said , reaching over for a smaller branch . It 's not often I have to use a ladder , but these were pretty far up . " She 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , we appreciate it , me and Rose , all the stuff you 've done for her . " " It 's good for me , " she said . Alice pulled on her braid for a while and then twisted it around her fingers . " There 's something that 's on my mind , Son , " she said . I looked down at her , but she was staring off toward the back pasture . Alice had gotten big overnight , the way girls around here will do . One day they just look like they 've got a little belly and the next morning they 're full-blown pregnant . I came down off the ladder . " What 's that ? " " Cecilia 's been asking me to teach her to swim this summer . I 'd told her awhile ago about the lakes down where I 'm from in Cadiz . You know Cadiz ? Lake Barkley and Kentucky Lake right there together . I told her about how everybody there knows how to swim as soon as they know how to walk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would I promise to teach her . " She stopped for a minute and pulled on her hair again . " The thing is , I wo n't be around this summer , and I 'm not sure she understands that . It makes me think that maybe I 've done her a disservice , getting so close to her and all . " Alice looked so young standing in that field where everything else was growing alongside of her . I felt like she was just a baby , closer to Sissy in age than a few years younger than Rose . She was a good girl . " What about you ? " I said . " Maybe there 's been a disservice done to you , too . It wo n't be so easy giving her up . " Alice smiled . " But that 's what we do here , " she said . " We give things up . For me it 's just a matter of fact , but I 'm twenty , Cecilia 's five . " I wanted to ask her how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was clear enough that she 'd had a tough go of things . " It 'll be hard for her , no doubt about that , but I think she 's better off knowing you than not . I think it would be worse if you pulled away from her now than waiting a couple of months until you had to . " She nodded her head and dug her hands into the small of her back . " Good , " she said . " That 's what I wanted you to say . " " It 'll walk you back , " I said . " Stay with your work . That 's all I needed to talk about . " " This tree would be happier if I left it alone . " She nodded her head and we walked back to Saint Elizabeth 's without talking . Alice seemed to be concentrating on everything very hard , the field and the sky and the edge of the woods that  | led to my house . It was almost like she was trying to memorize it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was gone she 'd have something to remember all this by . I just stayed quiet and left her alone . " I 'm going to see if Cecilia is up from her nap , " Alice said once we got inside . " Sure , " I said . We went our own ways , and I was feeling better for having talked to her , not that I thought things were going to be any easier now , but it seemed better , having them out in the open . I went into the kitchen to get myself a glass of water and found Rose sitting at the kitchen table talking to some woman holding a baby in her arms . " Son ! " Rose said . " Look at this . Angie 's here . " I had never heard Rose sound so happy about anything . " Hey , Son , " Angie said , and got up and kissed me . Her hair was shorter and combed neatly and she did n't have on any dangling jewelry , but it was Angie all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How have you been ? " I said . I was so happy to see her . Rose and me both had done so much worrying about Angie over the years that we just gave up talking about it . " Bad for a while , then real good , " she said . " It was like I was telling Rose . I was down for so long after I went home . I kept wanting to call but my mother said that I should put the whole thing behind me , you know , past in the past and all of that . Then once I cheered up and I realized that my mother was , as usual , full of shit , I felt embarrassed that so much time had gone by without me calling , so I did n't call because of that . But this is Duane , this is my son . " She held the baby up and jiggled him around a little until he looked at me . " I figure a baby is a new start , clean slate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Rose said . " Who 's Duane ? " " This guy I used to go with a long time ago , before I was here . Everything was such a long time ago . " She laughed . " God , it 's weird being back . You still in the kitchen , Mother Corinne still in her office , pregnant girls still running up and down the halls . Girls are always going to get knocked up , " Angie said . " That 's just a fact . " " Did Duane ever know " Rose tilted her head to one side " about all this ? " " Nope , " Angie said . " And he never will . That 's why it was hard for me to come and visit . I told him I was visiting a cousin  | in Lexington . It would be pretty hard to explain that my best friend is someone I met in Saint Elizabeth 's if I say I 've never been here . I should have called , but I wanted to surprise you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well make a big deal out of coming back . " That was when Alice and Sissy came in . " Mommie , Alice and me are going to have tea on the porch . " " Alice and I , " Alice said . " Not just yet . Come here and say hello to my friend Angie , Mrs. . . . What is your name now ? " " Tyler , " Angie said absently . " Mrs. Tyler . Mrs. Tyler and I were friends before you were born . " Sissy came up and looked at the baby carefully . He was a good baby , quiet and settled like she had been . " She 's so big , " Angie whispered . " I never thought she 'd be so big already . " " You 'll see , " Rose said . " That 's the way it goes . " " Maybe we should go on outside , " Alice said . " What do you say , give the grown-ups some time to talk . " " Wait a minute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got down on the kitchen floor on her knees . She took the barrette out of Sissy 's hair and smoothed it down with her fingers , then clipped the barrette back into place . " There , " she said . Her voice was shaking a little . " Now you look better . " Sissy touched her hair . " What do you say ? " Rose said . " Thank you , " Sissy said . She looked at Duane again . " Bye , baby . " She started to go and then stopped , suddenly remembering why she had come in in the first place . " Can I sleep with Alice tonight ? " " Here ? " I said . " All night ? " " It 's okay , " Alice said . " No , " I said . " I do n't want you over here all night . " " Sister Bernadette said yes . She said yes if it was just once , " Sissy said . " Fine , " Rose said . " As long as Alice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the back door and Angie stayed on the floor for a few more minutes . I turned to say something to Rose , but Angie beat me to it . " I never thought about her getting big like that , " she said , but not really to anyone . Then she shook her head and smiled at Rose . " She must  | look just like Thomas , ' cause she sure does n't look a thing like you. , , The words hung in the air for a minute , and none of us knew for sure what to say . Rose turned her face toward the baby , but I do n't think she saw him . Then finally Duane started to fuss a little and Angie took him back and everything went back to the way it was before . " I 'll let you two alone , " I said . " I know you have a lot of catching up to do . " " It was good to see you , " Angie said . " I think about you , Son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you drove me to the hospital . I never thanked you for that . " " Do n't think about that , " I said , but I did n't just mean that . I meant everything . Do n't think about any of it . I kissed her again and touched the baby 's cheek and headed outside , back out to the field to pick up the branches of the sycamore tree . All the way there I heard his name . It was better before , when I did n't know his name . Angie and Rose stayed late in the kitchen that night and Sissy was with Alice and I went home and felt sorry for myself . Being alone is something you have to be good at to enjoy and over the last five years I had forgotten how . I started to pull out the couch to make up Cecilia 's bed , and then saw what I was doing and felt foolish . I decided I would build her a bedroom as soon as I was sure the spring rains were over . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was getting too big for sleeping on the couch and as little as any of us were home we never saw the sense in moving . I did n't like being home without her , and I was mad at Rose for letting her go so easy . I heated up some soup for dinner and ate it standing up next to the sink . Then I washed my bowl and went on to bed . When Rose came in I woke up , even though she was trying to be quiet . " Is it late ? " I asked her . I was glad I was up , I wanted to tell her about Sissy , that she should care a little bit about where she was spending the night . " Not too bad , " she said . " Midnight . " " Angie 's driving back this late ? " " She called Duane , she told him she was having fun so he told her to stay awhile . " Rose 's voice sounded light and girlish . I watched her take her dress off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of the bed , wearing her panties and a bra . " We had such a good time , " she said , and put her hand over my  | hand . " I had forgotten how nice it was to have " but she did n't finish her sentence . She ran her hand absently up and down my arm . " Did you miss me ? " she said . " I did . " " That 's good to know . " She looked at me lying in the bed . She ran her finger up my arm and down the center of my chest . " I said good night to Cecilia . I tucked her in . Alice 's roommate had her baby , so Cecilia had her own bed . She said , tell Daddy good night . " She put both hands flat out on my chest and leaned toward me . I watched her breasts curve down into her bra . I watched the way they moved with her breath . I thought of how I had been alone a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair falling forward on her face , close enough that I could smell the warmth of her . I put my hand back behind her neck and brought her face to mine . So many girls came and went over the years , after a while it seemed like everybody only stayed for a few days . You get one of their names , and the next time you think to ask someone says she 's been gone two weeks already . I wished I was better at this . I used to be . Alice managed to slow time down . We all got used to her , came to like having her around . But by June it was clear she was n't going to be there much longer . I tried to tell Sissy , Alice tried . We explained to her about the baby and that when it came Alice would have to go just like everybody else , but Sissy would n't hear it . It was summer and she was running all over the place . It was hot that first week in June and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather made her sick , her ankles were swollen . She was sad in her last weeks , as if she suddenly understood after all that time what she was there for . Sometimes when she watched Sissy from the window she looked like she was going to cry , even though Alice was n't the kind of girl you 'd think of as crying . " I want you to have my parents ' address , " she said to me one afternoon . " Write me a letter every once in a while and let me know how she 's doing . This place is hell , " she said , printing out the street name on the back of an envelope . " Who would of thought I 'd want to stay on ? " Alice left in the middle of that same night with Sister Bernadette and Sister Serena . Rose and I talked it over at breakfast . " We have to tell her now , " Rose said , " before she starts asking where she is. "  | I twisted a napkin up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt . " " It 's not you hurting her . It 's not anybody hurting her . This is the way things go around here . " Sissy came in and looked around . " I ca n't find Alice , " she said . " Come here , " Rose said . Sissy came over to the table , and Rose pulled her up into her lap . " Alice had her baby last night . " Sissy 's face lit up . " When are we going to see it ? " " We ca n't , " Rose said . " Alice is gone . You knew that she would have to leave once the baby was born . " " She 's coming back , " Sissy said . " She ca n't , sweetie . That 's the way the nest works . You knew that . " Sissy looked horrified , like you do the first time you lose something in your life , the first time you understand that things can be lost . " She 's upstairs , " Sissy said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her with one wide sweep of my arm . She buried her face in my chest and cried , worse than she had as a baby , worse than she ever did with a fever . Her back heaved up again and again against my shirt and I rocked her and made clucking sounds . " Alice is n't gone , " she sobbed . " Alice is fine , " I said . " She 's A-number-one-okay . She just had to go with the baby . " I wanted to eat her pain , take it into me and make it my own . " I want her to come back , " she cried . " I 'm sorry , " I said . " I want my mother , " she cried . " Here I am , baby , " Rose said . " I 'm right here . " But when Sissy looked at her she turned her face away . " No , " she said , crying like it was the end of all the earth . " I want my mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was shot . It was almost his somewhere in the back of my mind I knew that things would be worse , even worse than the hospital and doctors , once I got home . The bullet and the knee were nothing compared to what was coming . Remember , this was 1942 , when everyone was going off to war , and the ones who came back to their hometowns wounded or crippled came back that way because they 'd been fighting , not because they were screwing around on a marine base in the middle of the night . So the first thing I said when I woke up in the hospital was , bow long before I 'm healed up and you can ship me over ? It was stupid , because I knew the second that gun went off there was n't going to be any war as far as I was concerned . The military takes their time in these sorts of things . Even when they knew how it was all going to go as clear as I did , they waited a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgot for a while and then remembered . But finally I got the word and it was medical discharge . The hospital was pretty much empty . I had a whole ward to myself . It was so early in the war , guys had n't been shipped back yet . I lied . I told them I had a feeling that when this thing healed up I was going to be good as new , so why did n't they just keep me around awhile and let me do what I could . The marines may be slow to make up their minds , but once they do they never changed them . Even if I healed up all the way , they said , the chance of reinjury was too great . The hole in my knee was something that I 'd have with me , to one degree or another , for the rest of my life . And that was true , ' cause my foot turned in some and gave me a limp , but it does n't bother me now unless the cold turns 173 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it . I know there 's some pain in my knee , but I never stop and think about where it came from . I was entitled to a disability check . Seventeen dollars a month . My parents drove all the way to South Carolina to pick me up . It took four marines to get me into the back of the station wagon , my leg stuck out straight . One of them was Perry , from the bunk next to mine . All the guys had been real good about coming to see me in the hospital . " I know it does n't seem like it now , " Perry said , " but it 'll turn out that you 're the one that 's lucky . You wait and see , the rest of us will go over there and get shot in places a whole lot worse than the knee . " " Do n't say that , " I told him . " This is good luck for all of you . Now one of us has been shot , the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Id write to him every now and then . He did n't say it , but I knew it was because he did n't get a lot of mail , and I did write to him , pretty regular , until he was killed in forty-five . He survived several landings in the Pacific , but his luck ran out on Okinawa . He stood at the gates of the base and waved good-bye as I drove away with my parents . " Everybody at home 's been worried sick about you , " my mother said . " It was in all the papers , even in Nashville . That boy , Bill Lovell " " Do n't , " I said . " That 's the last person he wants to talk about , " my father said . " It is n't that , " I said . " It 's just it was an accident , is all . " I looked out the window and remembered everything we passed from the bus ride coming up . I had n't even been gone long enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to place blame . " " Cecilia 'll be awful glad to see you , " my mother said . " I got her letters . " " She said she was going to wait at our house until you got home , that she 'd stay there all night if she had to . " I wanted to see Cecilia . I wanted to press my face into her hair and close my eyes . That was the part that made it all so crazy . Here I 'd been waiting all this time to go away so I could get back and marry her and now I was coming back and I did n't want to be . It was n't that I did n't want to marry her , I did more than ever . But I felt like I 'd let her down , her personally , by  | g shot in Parris Island instead of some island in the Pacific . was never such a fool that I did n't know it was my enlisting t made her want me . We had a deal in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it . You make me proud and I 'll be yours . w that I would n't be living up to my half , I wondered if she was planning on living up to hers . " You suppose she 'll still want to go through with the whole thing ? " I said . The wedding ? " my father said . The wedding , sure , what with all of this . " My mother craned around in her seat so she could see me . " Oh , Son , you do n't know what she 's been through . You do n't know how she 's cried . We 've all had our doubts about Cecilia , but I can tell you , things are different now . " " It 's all made her grow up a lot , " my father said . " You wait and see , " my mother said . " That 's one thing you wo n't have to worry about . " I leaned my head against the backseat window and closed my eyes . Me and Cecilia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I really did . When we got home it was nearly three in the morning . It was a little harder getting out of the car than it was getting into it , on account of the fact there were no marines around to give us a hand , but we did it and I was up on my crutches and standing in front of my house . That 's what I remember , trying to get up those steps the first time . I came into the living room and Cecilia was asleep on the sofa and I felt like it had been years since I 'd seen her and for a minute I was glad about the way everything had gone because it meant I was getting to look at her.asleep . My mother went over and shook her shoulder gently and said , look who 's here . Cecilia sat up and smiled faintly and looked around like she did n't know what she was supposed to be looking for . " Son , " she said , almost surprised . " You 're home . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . She got up and put her arms around my waist and held me , and my parents stood and smiled . She felt warm , like a blanket wrapped around you in one place . Then my mother drove her home to her own house , her own bed , and my father helped me up the stairs to mine . I had n't been gone ten weeks , but when I woke up the next morning from a dream of Billy Lovell crying over me in the dirt , I felt too old to be in that room again . Nothing had changed ,  | my high school pennant and one from Vanderbilt , the maple bed , the red bedspread , the rug and the curtains and Cecilia 's junior class picture framed on the nightstand . I 'm not saying I 'd grown up so much since I 'd been gone , though I had some to be sure . It was more that I did n't think I 'd be back this way . I was going off to war and now the room was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would come home from the war and marry Cecilia and we would live in a house of our own , a double bed , pots and pans , a radio . It was past ten o'clock , I had slept so late . I thought of all the guys , having run already , through with breakfast , and drilling on the grinder by now . My mother knocked once on the door and then came in and sat on the edge of my bed . " You sleep all right ? " she said . I nodded . " Yourself ? " " Fine , having you back . " She patted my hand . " I have some good news . I called Mr. Franklin , the principal , last week , once we knew for sure when you were coming back , and he said you can come back to school . The teachers will help you make up the work you 've missed so that you can graduate on time . Truth is , they probably wo n't make you do all of it . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the feeling I got . " " I ca n't go back to school , " I said , not even thinking about it . " Why not ? You 're home now . " " I 'm too old to go back to high school . " " That 's ridiculous , " my mother said , standing up . " You are n't any older than you were when you left . You wo n't be any older than any of your friends . You 'll graduate with your class , Son , right on time . You 're going to have to make the best of what 's happened . " But my friends , Joe Logan and Gary Allbrittan and Randy Todd , would all be gone . They left when I did , or a few days after . By the end of the year pretty much everyone had signed up . " I 'll think about it , " I said . " There is n't anything to think about , " she said . " Now come on and get up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before too long . Do you need help ? " " No . Why is n't she in school ? " " It 's Saturday , " she said , and shut the door . I struggled around with my clothes for a while , but it was all a little harder than I thought it would be . I was used to the nurses being there . Once you get over feeling embarrassed all the time you can see they 're a whole lot of help . My leg liked being left  | alone , me on my back , it up on pillows , and no more movement than whatever breezes came through the room . The business of getting up and getting my clothes and twisting myself around trying to get into them set off a pain I had n't felt in weeks . I sat back down on the bed and lifted the heavy cast up with both hands . I looked at it , lying there on the unmade bed . It was n't my leg at all . Then my father came in and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , and he looped one of my arms over his neck and pulled me up slow . " Girlfriend 's coming over , " he said . " We might ought to get you in a tub first . " My father was a big man , though not as big as I turned out to be . That year he would have been thirty-nine , since he was only twenty-two when I was born . It 's something , to remember my father young like that , knowing I 'm so much older now than he was on that day . We crowded into the bathroom , him and me and my cast , and he shut the door . " Do n't think I do n't have any idea what Im doing , " he said , pulling my pajama top over my head . " I gave you plenty of baths in your day . Course , that was all a long time ago . " He leaned over and turned on the water , slipping the little rubber stopper into place . He kept checking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , and eased me down onto the edge of the tub . " We do n't want a lot of water . " The room must have felt good , it must have been warm , with the heat on and the steam from the bath and two grown men , but the only thing I remember feeling was ashamed . I do n't know why now , because it was only my father , but at that moment I had let him down , too . Sitting half naked on the edge of the bathtub I wanted to cover myself . " I think I can take it from here , " I said . My father stepped back to get a good look at the whole picture . He was a contractor , he knew how things worked . " I can see you getting in okay , but I ca n't see you being able to get out . " " I 'll manage . " " Well , chances are you would , but here 's the thing , your mother was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't think it was such a good idea . So if I mess it up , you know who 'll be raising hell . " I nodded my head . He was right . I got good at doing things for myself , once the leg could stand to be jostled around a bit , but in my first week home I was dependent . I needed help . " Get out of these , " my father said .  | I lifted up my hips and he pulled down the bottoms of my pajamas and then carefully took them off my foot and then the cast . Then he put his arms around my chest and helped me to lower myself into the water , being careful not to get the cast wet . It was n't hard , it did n't go much past my knee . " What in the hell is that ? " my father said . I looked over and saw him staring at my shoulder , at Cecilia 's name . All the scabs had come off it while I was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me about it , took real good care to keep it clean . I thought that even as they said they did n't approve , they would n't have minded seeing their names on the arms of fellows they knew . " I got a tattoo , " I said . " I can see that . " " It was first liberty , " I said . " We 'd all been drinking . " My father sat back on his heels . " I thought about getting one of those , long time ago . Never got around to it . " He looked again . " I would n't show your mother anytime soon , least not till she 's through worrying about your knee . " He smiled and shook his head . " You go off to boot camp and get yourself tattooed and get yourself shot . Most people do n't do that much in a whole war . " By the time Cecilia came I was dry and dressed and sifting on the couch downstairs with my leg up . I wanted to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take her places we could be alone , tell her every thought I 'd had those last ten weeks , every time I 'd said her name aloud . But my mother came in with a tray of coffee and my sister Martha ran into the room to say hello . Cecilia was wearing the sweater I had given her for Christmas last year . " I 'm sorry I was so asleep when you came in last night , " she said , sitting down on the edge of the couch , near my waist . " It was late , " I said . " I barely even remember you coming in . I 'd been waiting all that time and then when you finally came home I did n't even wake up all the way . " " I was pretty tired myself . " I wanted to kiss her . She looked at my cast for a minute , tapped the plaster lightly with one fingernail . " Does it hurt much ? " And I knew right then , though do n't ask me how . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think she even knew it yet . My eyes kind of lost their focus , like she was still sitting in front of  | but I could n't quite see her anymore . " No , " I said . " It 's " Everybody at school 's been worried . Your mom says you 're coming back . " " I do n't know yet . The leg 's better off staying still . " ' I could bring you the work , " she said , and then for a second she caught my stare . It was right there . When a person has left you as many times as Cecilia left me , you could see it coming from miles away . The first thought of going makes a sound as dear as somebody saying your name . She laughed and turned " you ' her eyes up to the ceiling . " Stop that , " she said , " you 're embarrassing me . " " You 're still wearing your ring , " I said . She held up her hand so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little white circles around the room . " Why should n't I be ? " " You should be . That means we 're going to get married . I want to get married now , " I said . I wanted to keep saying it , his reminding her would make a difference . Cecilia ran her finger up and down my cast . " We 'll get mar-ried , " she said . " Do n't worry about that . Just worry about getting better . Once this is off we can talk about getting married . " " This is n't going to be off for a while , " I said . Cecilia just smiled . " What difference does it make ? " she said . " We 're not going anywhere . " Sometimes I try to imagine what life would have been like had I married Cecilia . I believe , in my better moments , that there is a plan and things go not the way we want them to but the way they should . If my life had n't gone the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I never would have come to Habit . Then maybe Rose would n't have found someone to marry and maybe she would have given Sissy up and that was the thing that made all the events in my life up to the day she was born make sense . Before that , it had n't come together , I had n't been able to see things as part of something larger , the way my father would have . I could only see my own grief . But Sissy made everything worthwhile , suffering in the past , hard times ahead of us . It all made sense because it meant she stayed with us . Before , the only thing I 'd wanted was a life that God did not intend for me to have . I suffered the loss of things that were never mine , a house with Cecilia , children and neighbors and anniversaries . Until I met Rose , I could never see how the whole thing fit together . 11  | How much trouble my leg gave me exactly is hard to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have come to believe it . Too much to go into town , too much to try and drive , and too much to go to school . We were in the war now , and one by one there were names in the papers that we knew or the name of someone we did n't know but who lived in the next town , or dated your cousin once , or had your same last name . These were the ones who died , whose bodies came back or did n't . Every day I read the paper I would feel ashamed all over again , not so much for being alive , but for not having taken my chances rightfully . No one ever said this to me , even gave me the smallest cause to think it was true , but I was sure that people were thinking by now that I had shot myself as a way of getting out . Some days I half wondered if I had . I kept thinking the knee would take a turn and I would get back in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that now , and I thought there may still be time for me , but the knee would n't go along . Even when I finally got to moving around pretty well on my own , I could tell I was a long way from running off a landing craft onto a beach . Years off . My school agreed to let me work at home , and every day Cecilia would bring me my lessons and the notes she 'd taken in class . In truth , I was glad to have the work to do . It kept me busy . I was really a much better student those last months than I ever had been before . I sat at the kitchen table all day now , my leg stretched over several chairs , and I read books and worked long math problems in a notebook . My mother never bothered me . Until three o'clock every afternoon she treated me like I was in school . Then at three Cecilia came . All day long I would watch the clock and think about where she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , walking over the school lawn , stopping to talk to a friend , winding her way slowly toward my house . At first she would get to the house quickly , half out of breath . She would tell me what everyone had said and done that day , acting out both sides of every conversation . She would hold my hand as she talked and sometimes her engagement ring would slip to one side and bite into my fingers . But there was a war going on , and it did n't take long to see men who had been hurt while fighting . I imagine she met men , too , ones who were just getting ready to go off . Me and my leg , stretched out in my parents ' kitchen , did n't look quite as interTHE PATRON SAINT OF LIARS 181 and Cecilia started to come late . Some days she did n't , but sent somebody else instead . Time went by slowly and winter seemed longer than I had ever remembered it being , but by the spring I was just wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cane . I 'd p for short walks through the neighborhood at night , waiting until it was late enough that I would n't have to stop and explain myself to everyone I passed . Sometimes I would stand stock-1h71 in the driveway and shoot free throws into the hoop my fisher had put up on the garage when I was ten . Every time the Tail went through , one of my sisters would run and catch it and being it back to me . Sometimes I would ask Cecilia about the wedding , but she would always say , when your cast is off or after graduation or sot until you find a good job . We were breaking up , but the thing was , it was n't like all the other times before . We were breaking up but she was n't leaving . Cecilia sat the closest to me when my parents were in the room , and when I went for walks she wanted to come with me . And since I wanted her , needed her more than I ever had before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things would work out after all . But when we were alone she 'd nearly pull her hair out in frustration . By the last month of school it was all she could do to drop my books on the table and go . " I do n't know why you ca n't pick up your things yourself , " she said one day when she was giving me a math assignment . " Everyone knows your leg is fine . " " It is ? " " You 're going to sit right there for the rest of your life , let everybody else take care of you . Well , not me . I 'm not going to do it . " " You think this is all a joke ? You think I should go down and reenlist ? " Cecilia looked so angry . She was hugging her notebook to her chest . I watched the ring on her hand . It was always there . I had n't seen her take it off once , not since I put it on her . " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think . " I tensed the muscles in my leg . Tense , release , tense , release , just like the doctor told me . " I want to , " I said . " There 's nothing in the world I want more . It 's the only thing that could make half a difference to you , so you 've got to know by now that I 'd do it if I could . "  | She would n't say a word . Her face was as cold as anything I 'd ever seen in my life . " What I want to know , " I said quietly , because in truth a big part of me did n't want to know , " is why you keep coming around . If this whole thing is making you so crazy then why do you bother ? " " What am I going to do ? Have everyone in town say I broke off my engagement because you got shot ? " She pulled out a chair and sat down at the table across from me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at school , my parents , they keep saying how they all know this must be so hard for you and how great I am , helping you along . I hate it , you know ? I really hate it . I feel sometimes like I 'm already stuck in a marriage and I 'm not even married yet . " Then all of a sudden she looked up and stopped talking . It was like she realized that she was saying these things to the enemy , the person she was trying to get away from . She picked up her books and left without so much as a good-bye . This is how crazy I was : I thought , if that 's the reason she 's staying , at least she 's staying . The principal of our school , Mr. Franklin , came to the house to give me my exams . He seemed to understand my not wanting to come back , and so he never suggested it , even though by that point everyone knew I could have returned to classes . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , bringing out a file of papers I 'd written . My mother put a cup of coffee down on the table for him and then left the room , even though it was clear she wanted to stay . Mr. Franklin spooned two sugars into his coffee . " I think you should consider college . You 've done very well , now that you 've stopped concentrating on athletics . " It 's nothing but sheer vanity that makes me say this . Rose , I bet , would laugh if I told her that someone once said that I should go to college . But Mr. Franklin did . The weekend before graduation it turned fiercely hot out of nowhere . Late May , nobody could figure it out . My mother was up in the attic getting down the last of the summer clothes , packing the sweaters away in mothballs . My father was working a lot , because that 's the busy time of year for contracting . Cecilia came by when she knew my family was going to be around , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being alone with me was more than she could stand . As much as I tried to figure out what to do about it all , I could n't . The truth is , I had started to hate her a little . I looked forward to her visits less and  | less . I was feeling half as trapped by the whole thing as she was . But it never occurred to me that I could have come not to want her . That was n't the way it worked between us . I wanted her and she decided . That was the way things went . So on that hot Saturday when she showed up at the house and found me on the couch reading , I 'd just as soon she had n't come at all . I wanted to find out what was going to happen in the next chapter , and she was working so hard to make it clear to me that she was sorry she was with me that I was half ready to throw the book at her . Then my father came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you please get this boy out of the house ? Take him down to the quarry , get some sun on him . He looks like the underside of a rock . " " I ca n't swim yet , " I said . " It does n't sound like much fun . " " You do n't have to swim , " my father said . " Just get some air , get out . Take the station wagon . Cecilia can drive you . " Cecilia looked at me , told me in her way , get me out of this . " That sounds like a good idea , " she said . " Cecilia does n't have her suit , " I said . " So she 'll borrow one from Martha . You 're sounding like an old man , Son . You ca n't spend your whole life indoors . " So Cecilia went up to my sister 's mom and put her swimsuit on and then put her clothes back on top . I had to ride in the backseat with my leg up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I waited for her in the car and when she got in she did n't say anything and I did n't say anything , she just drove to the quarry . What I remember best was the heat . It felt good , the way the first few hot days will after a long , wet spring . The sun seemed to go right into your bones and work the winter out of you . I spread a blanket out on the ground and tossed my book down . Everything took me twice as long then , and Cecilia only stood there and watched . " I ca n't believe nobody 's here , " she said . " A day like this . " " It 's early , " I said . I pulled my shirt off over my head and stretched out on the ground . Cecilia took off her dress and stood there for a minute in my sister 's bathing suit , which was too big for her . " What 's that on your arm ? " she said , leaning closer . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tattoo . I figured I would show it to her on our wedding night . " Jesus , " she said , reading it over and over again . " How could you have done that ? " " It was when I was in boot camp . I was drunk . "  | " Jesus . " She walked away , toward the water . " Does anybody know about it ? " " My father 's seen it , the guys in boot camp , a couple of nurses . That 's about it . " " Your father 's seen this ? I ca n't believe you . Who would do a stupid thing like that ? " " It was n't a stupid thing . We were getting married , I was in love . I got a tattoo . " I started to stand up , but I do n't know why . " Stay there , " she said , her voice full of anger . " Do n't talk to me . Do n't look at me . " She walked into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my name , " she said . " You ca n't just go putting it wherever you want . " And then she was gone , underwater , swimming out toward the center of the quarry . I looked at her name for a while , tried to remember what I had been thinking that night . I loved her . I loved her even as she was swimming away from me , even as I was hating her . That 's the way it is , when you 've loved somebody your whole life . It 's like a direction you go in , even when you do n't want to go anymore . I lay back on the blanket and closed my eyes and felt the sun on my face . I listened to the sound of Cecilia 's even strokes through the water and occasionally the sound of her diving from one of the rocks and thought , she 'll stay out there her whole life rather than come onto dry land with me . I read for a while and then lay on my stomach to watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . I do n't know if an hour had passed , or two , but my skin was tight and red and I shaded my eyes with my hand to watch her dive . I thought that she must have gone down deep because she did n't come up . Then she did , came up and flipped her wet yellow hair aside and waved her hand and I started to wave to her . I could n't remember if I was angry at her at that moment or not , and then she was gone again , back under the water . I found my cane and stood up . My leg was stiffer for lying still . Again she came up and her head was thrown back and her neck was long and wet in the midday light and smeared with a bright streak of red coming down from her forehead . Her mouth made one terrible round O. She was pulling air in , as much as she could get before going down again , which she did . The water set itself right almost immediately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like nothing was going on at all . Nothing was wrong . It was like watching something very far away , something that had happened years before , even while it was happening right in front  | me . She broke the surface again . She did n't make a sound , er than the splashing , because she wanted to save her lungs taking air in , not forcing it out . Her wild eyes passed over and suddenly I understood . That was still Cecilia and I was I here . It was n't yet something that had happened , but some-g that was happening , and even as I understood this I stood there . I took a full minute to watch her suffer and watch her want me as I had wanted her all my life . Then I went into the water with my shoes and pants and brace . The leg pulled down , but I was swimming . I did not see Cecilia . She had said as much with her eyes , that that had been her last time up . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , and felt along the bottom in darkness . Huge rocks jutted up and I traced around them with my hands . The water made its own world , and I remember thinking this is where I 'm going to die . I pushed myself up again and breathed like Cecilia . I made sure it was the right spot and then went down to feel the silt and rocks , some branches blown in by storms . I felt the pressure of the water , the way my leg pinned me there to the bottom . I came up again and gulped the air and thought how much bigger I was than Cecilia , how much more these lungs could take in . The third time down her hand brushed my face , not at the bottom but resting on the top of some branches , and I took it and pulled it up with me , forced her head above the water as if it would make a difference and I screamed , " Somebody help me . " I was pulling two weights back , Cecilia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put one arm beneath her arms and pulled myself backward , calling again and again until someone called back . A family I could barely see crested the hill when we were still twenty feet out and by the time the man had made it to the edge of the water , we were pretty much there . He only had to get wet up to his knees pulling us in . I knew those people , they went to church with us . There was a basket of food on the ground that they had dropped and the mother was pressing her two children into her skirt so they could n't see Cecilia 's face , which was cut along her left temple . Her mouth was still in that same O. I lay back on the bank with her on top of me . Martha 's swimsuit was half falling off of her it was so big , as if the water had made Cecilia even smaller . The man , Mr. Thompson , I ca n't remember now what he did for a living , he was trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seem to help him . He was pushing on her chest , pushing her back into my chest , trying to work the water out of her lungs .  | Her hair spread out against my chest , so much longer and darker than it was when it was dry . The wife asked should she go and call for somebody but the husband said no , we should take her in ourselves . " Come on , Son , " he said . " Get up now . " He helped me up and Cecilia just came with me and I knew the day was hot but I could n't feel it anymore . I took her legs in my other arm and we walked back toward their car . The mother stayed behind . She would n't let the children in the car with us and they were crying . My knee was starting to swell and I was ashamed that I even knew how much it hurt . Mr. Thompson opened the door of his car for me . " Come on , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . He was sweating and his hair was slicked down against his head . " Get in the car , " he said . But I could n't . I just stood there . " Son , " he said . " We need to get going . " " I 'm soaking wet , " I said . " I 'll get your car all wet . " It was the first thing I had said and my voice felt strange coming out of my mouth , like it had been months since I 'd tried to speak . " Do n't worry about that . " He helped me inside . He put us in the back , where we 'd have more room . There were a couple of toys on the floor , a yellow dump truck , some other things . When I sat down Cecilia 's head fell back against my shoulder and I remembered one night we were coming home from a football game and she was starting to get a cold and got so tired waiting for me to shower and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I picked her up in my arms she went to sleep right away , like a baby . I carried her home and took her in the house and her mother did n't say a word , but led me upstairs to her room . I laid Cecilia in her bed and watched her mother take off her shoes and cover her up with a blanket and we both backed out of the room together so we would n't wake her up . The cut on her forehead did n't look so bad . It was n't bleeding at all . It looked as clean as a tear made in paper . She was just so white , all her skin was cold and puckered from the water . All her skin was showing with just that bathing suit on , her legs and arms , her neck . I had never seen so much of her before , and it made me look away . I rocked her a little and said " Shhhhh , " but I ca n't imagine why . Mr. Thompson did n't say anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving fast and people were blowing their horns at us . We got to Dr. Smith 's office and there was a lot of commo-  | n once we got inside . People who 'd been waiting to see the for were trying to take her out of my arms but I just could n't let go of her . Mr. Thompson was crying then , I saw him . " She drown , " he said . " Son here tried to save her but she hit her head and drown the quarry . " It was the middle of the day and still so pretty outside . Even inside the light was coming in everywhere . Then finally Dr. Smith came up to me and said , " If we 're going to help her , you 're going to have to let her go . " And I heard help her , and my arm fell away and he took her off so fast . Martha 's swimsuit going through the door . It was pink and nubby and soft and too big for Cecilia . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They put me in , too . They would n't let me go home . Mr. Thompson went back to the quarry for his family . The nurse took me to a little room in the back where I took off my clothes and lay down . She said she was going to have to give me something for my knee . And then she did . For the second time that year I was in the local papers even said , " Marine Risks All in Attempt to Save Wife 's Life . " So many people got it wrong that I started to realize they were doing it on purpose . It sounded better to say we were just married . The people in Ashland City felt real bad for me when I got shot , but as time went on and their sons went to war and I was home in my parents ' house , maybe they thought my deal was n't so tragic after all . At least I was safe . But when Cecilia died , a wave of grief went up from every corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me as it was for her . I had loved her for as long as anyone could remember , for as long as I could remember . And when she had finally agreed to marry me everyone was happy and they said no one had ever waited for a girl the way I had and no one deserved her more . Our wedding would have been so crowded that people would have had to stand on the steps outside the church , they would have spilled out onto the street , all of them waiting to catch sight of us because they felt in some small way like they had a personal stake in the whole thing . Folks made two casseroles , two hams , two pies , one for Ce-cilia 's family and one for mine . They told the story to one another in our living rooms : Son had fallen asleep . His leg had been giving him a lot of pain that day and he could hardly walk . He fell asleep while Cecilia was swimming . It was such a hot l  | day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone outside on such a day would have fallen asleep . But when she called out he woke up and ran right into the water , forgetting about the leg and the brace , forgetting that he could barely walk and could n't swim at all he went right into the water and pulled her out but by the time he got there it was too late . I stood in the kitchen . As much as I tried not to hear them , as softly as they spoke , I must have heard it fifty times . When they came up onto the shore he could n't let go of her , of her body . Yes , that 's what Jim Thompson told me . He just lay there and held her and he kept saying , somebody help me , even after they were on shore and she was dead I know , it breaks my heart , too . The weather stayed nice all week , not as hot , but warm and clear . The day that they buried her was so nice that it just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blooming already to do the whole thing up real pretty . Those are the only two things that I remember about that day at all . The flowers were nice and the weather was nice . People were getting used to the whole idea of funerals in 1942 . My suit was hanging on the back of my closet door all the time , one memorial service or another . But that was soldiers dying , and while I do n't mean to say that is n't as bad , it was something you were ready for in a way . Cecilia drowning caught everybody off guard . It just was n't the time for that kind of loss . No one took it well , my father least of all . He could n't get past the fact that he had sent us out there , talked us into going when clearly neither of us wanted to . He blamed himself so bitterly that I came close to telling him the truth . He was n't the one who killed Cecilia . Over the years I came to live with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a difference between killing someone and watching them die . But at the time it was as good as if I 'd held her under the water myself , took her into the quarry and pinned her there and watched her look up at me with disbelief then fear then not at all . For days after her death I waited for the sheriff to come for me . I would hear him telling my father at the door , I would hear my father say no . When he came for me I never knew what I wanted , if it would be better to go along and have it be over or would there still be time enough for me to run out the back door and get away . Tall and lame both , I could n't have gone too far . I did n't want to go to prison , that was the truth . THE PATRON SAINT OF LIARS 1 89 Even if it meant having some peace from my own nightmares , I was too afraid . The other thing I dreamed about was this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the dream I went into the water and pulled her out , pushed the water from her chest like Mr. Thompson did , but this time her eyes flicked open and she saw me and was thankful . At that moment Cecilia would have loved me the way she had on Pearl Harbor Day , except this time she owed me her life and so the love never changed . For a long time I believed this would have been true , and then I came to realize that , true or not , she was dead and I 'd never have the chance to know for sure . I never did tell either of these things to anyone . I just got quieter . It did n't take long for me to forget I had ever been anything but happy with Cecilia . I could see it on every tree I went by , her name carved in like a reminder of something to do . I could see it on my own shoulder , and I got to where I could n't stand it anymore . By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to get and I told my parents I was leaving . " Leaving for where ? " my mother said . " Does n't matter . " I could n't bring myself to sit down at the table with them . I stood by the stove and pushed my hand through my hair over and over again . I talked to my folks so little back then that I 'd already put off going for a long time because I did n't know how to tell them exactly . " You ca n't just go , " my mother said , sort of half smiling ' cause she was trying to keep it all from getting away from her . " We need to know where you are , how you 're doing . " " I 'd tell you if I knew , " I said , slowly . " I just do n't . " " These are hard times , Son , " my mother said . " Hard times for all of us . There 's been more pain for you than anyone thought possible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're better off here , with people who love you . " My father was looking inside his cup of coffee , moving the handle back and forth as he listened . " You go if you need to go , " he said . My mother looked up at him and lost the end of her smile . I looked up , too . " I want you to stay , " he said . " But she 's everywhere . I know that . " I felt such relief at that moment that I almost changed my mind about going . The fact that someone had seen it too , my father had seen it , gave me the closest thing to joy I 'd had since her death . 1 ,  | If he understood , then maybe he knew this too : when she died they lost me . I would have to go away . A better man would have seen things through , stayed in town and sorted it all out . People die , terrible things happen . I know this now . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too much sadness in the world and not enough places to go . But at seventeen , I did n't understand , and so I left . For a long time I stayed in Tennessee , sometimes dipping down into Alabama or up into Kentucky . Once I got as far as Indiana . I ca n't much remember what I did where , it all pretty much runs together in my mind . Work was easy to find because I said I was a marine and had been shot . I had a limp to prove that . There was a shortage of men my age , so there was always something for me . For this same reason , women were easy to find , too . Some I stayed with for a night , others a week or two . I stayed until they wanted me to leave or , worse even , until they wanted me not to . I know I should have cared for them more than I did , but it just was n't in me . All I wanted was to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live , I thought it was right . I did n't make friends or enemies either in that time . I did my jobs well , and people said so . I was good at carrying out orders . Then one day I was hitching to Owensboro for no reason in particular and the truck I was riding in broke down near Habit . I walked into town and asked around about work and some people said if I had the stomach for it I should go down to Saint Elizabeth 's . The folks in Habit did n't cotton much to Catholics back then , or to pregnant girls without husbands , though in those days they were mostly girls who got in trouble right as their fellow was going off to war and then he did n't come home . I walked a couple of miles in the direction they pointed me and came on a neat little white house off of the road . It was smaller than I thought it would be and in good shape , which meant there would n't be a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her forties who was still good-looking an-swered . " Evening , " I said . " Is this Saint Elizabeth 's ? " She laughed a little . " No , no , " she said . " Over there . " She pointed to a break in the woods . " In the back pasture , that way . You looking for somebody ? " " Just work . " She nodded . " I thought so . You do n't look like the regular customer they get over there . "  | Myface flushed and I turned away from her . You should give them a holler , " she said . " They 're good e . Always looking for somebody to do things . " " Much obliged , " I said , and started to turn off the porch . You from around here ? " she said . " No , ma'am . " She looked at me hard . " I did n't think I recognized you . This a small town . I guess I know about everybody . " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood around here . " I nodded . " I 'll be heading over there , then , " I said , but when I got into her yard she called me back again . I turned around . " What 's your name ? " she said . " Son . " " Well , Son , I 'm June . When you go over there , you tell them Jane Clatterbuck says to give you a job . " " Obliged . " " Then you come back here later and tell me how it went , you bear ' ? " I said I would , and I did . June Clatterbuck was the first friend I made in Habit . I 'll never forget the sight of the place , the very first time I laid eyes on it from the entrance of the drive . I forget how pretty it is . It 's all just work to me now . But that night it was around six o'clock and just getting dark . The light caught in every one of the front windows and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far and away the biggest place I 'd ever seen in my life , and when I walked up toward it I was really hoping there 'd be something for me to do so I 'd have the chance to look around some in the morning . That and the fact it was getting late and I needed a place to sleep . It was a smaller operation then , seven girls and Sister Evangeline and another Sister named Mary Joseph , who has long since passed away . Sister Evangeline was mother superior back then , but since there were just the two of them , she never brought it up to anybody . I rang the bell , and Sister Mary Joseph answered the door . She smiled up at me . She was a real sweet woman , Sister Mary Joseph , and she said , " What can I do to help you ? " That 's just what she said , first thing , and that 's the way she meant it , too . So I told her I was looking for work , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She asked me my name and told me '  | hers . " She 's having supper now , " she said . " We 're all having supper . Have you eaten ? " I told her I had n't , and with that she opened the door wider and let me in . You 've got to remember this was a long time ago , when folks treated each other decently without knowing them . I followed her into the dining room where everyone was sitting together at one table . The seven girls looked down at the napkins in their laps when Sister Mary Joseph introduced me and I remember I felt so awful , like I 'd caught them all half dressed or something . Back then we used to say a girl was in a family way , and the thought of that seemed so sad because here were all these girls with no families to speak of . I wanted to tell them that I should go , or at least wait in the other room until they were finished eating , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when Sister Mary Joseph led me to a chair there was nothing I could do but sit in it and accept my plate . Sister Evangeline must have been around fifty then , but she was still pretty much the same . The little tuft of hair that stuck out from the front of her wimple was brown instead of white and maybe she was n't as heavy , but she chattered a lot and filled up people 's plates with food they were n't hungry for . She tried to ask me some questions over dinner , but it was all I could do to choke out the smallest yes or no . After a while she just gave up . " Maybe Mr. Abbott will help with the dishes tonight and give you girls a rest , " she said after we had eaten our tapioca pudding . Sister Mary Joseph gathered the girls together and led them out into the lobby . Not one of them said a word . I helped Sister Evangeline pick up the plates and took them into the kitchen . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without Rose being in it , but this was 1944 and Rose had n't even been born yet . " You do n't need to do the dishes , " Sister Evangeline said once the door swung shut behind us . " I just thought it might be better for us to talk alone . " " I 'd like to do them , " I said . It always made me feel better , doing something to earn my keep . I turned on the hot water and stacked them in the sink . " What kind of work are you looking for ? " she asked . She was wiping down the counters but not paying a lot of attention to what she was doing and she kept missing spots . 1  | " I 'll do whatever you 've got , wiring , plumbing , painting . My father 's a contractor . He taught me how to do a little bit of everything . " She nodded . " That 's what we need around here , a little bit ef everything . I could pay you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bishop and see if there 's money for bigger jobs . We 've seeded help around here . It 's been hard getting somebody from town . " " I do n't need to stay on , " I said . " I 'm really just passing through . " I ran a couple of plates under the water and stacked them in the dish rack . " Headed where ? " " No place special , " I said , and then I was worried ' cause I did n't want to sound like a vagrant . " I like traveling , is all . " " And you do n't like the war ? " she said , but in a nice way . " I got shot in the knee , " I said . " I 'm not much good to them anymore . " She nodded . " I see , " she said . " But you did n't get shot in the war . " I never said exactly . I always liked to tell it so people would think that 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " I was shot in basic training . It was an accident . " She smiled and patted my hand . " Do n't mind me , " she said . " I 'm just interested . You , for example . You do n't seem like someone who 's been to war , which is why I asked you that . That 's the kind of thing that 's easy to tell about a person . " " You can tell things about everybody ? " " No , no . " She waved me off , trying to pretend for a second like she was shy , but she could n't make it work . " I know a lot about babies , they 're my specialty . But sometimes I can tell things about grown people . There are things anyone can tell , if they pay attention . Like you 're not a traveler . That 's not your nature at all . Everything about you says that you 're the kind of man to stay in one place . Now what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not feeling too comfortable . " I used to be , but people change . " " Exactly , " she said , very happy , like we were playing some sort of game where the point was for her to guess things about me . She picked up a plate and dried it a little and then set it back in the rack like maybe she 'd decided she was n't so interested in drying after all . " So what we know about you is that you used to be a person who stayed in one place , and that place was Tennessee because I can tell from your accent . I 'd even go  | so far as to say middle Tennessee . Then you enlisted for the war because you wanted to defend your country . You seem like a good man , and that 's what a good man would do , but there was an unfortunate accident and you were sent home for your knee to get better . And after that , something happened , that was n't about the war or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveler . The bad thing was something else entirely . " I stared at her . My hands were in the water but they were n't washing dishes , they were just in the water and all of the sudden the feeling was so familiar that I felt those same words come up in my mouth , Help me , somebody , but instead I said yes , it was something else . Sister Evangeline looked at me straight in the eye and said , " And that something was n't your fault . " And then she put her hands down in the water and held my hands .  | EVER SINCE I got married and Sissy was born , I never saw Miss June as much as I would have liked . Work kept me busy , same as ever , but now instead of spending my evenings wandering around , hoping to find somebody who was up and maybe willing to sit and talk for a while , I stayed at home . It was the only time I got to really see Sissy and Rose , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on them and wanting their attention . Course , I was going over there a lot , picking Sissy up or dropping her off . We went to June 's for dinner every once in a while , and Rose got over to see her some . Sissy was ten then , and she and June got along real well , but I hardly got over there just to visit the way I used to and I felt bad about that . I looked after her though . I always cleaned her gutters in the spring and put her storms up for her in the fall . I kept up with her lawn just like the rest of the property . But still , I should have sat with her more . All the time she put in with me when I did n't know anyone in town . Until she died , I 'd forgotten how much I 'd relied on her . It came quick , a stroke . " I do n't mind a stroke , " Miss June told me once , " so long as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one that will leave me crippled up , dependent on some-body . " It came to her over lunch and she died in her kitchen . Sister Evangeline found her at two o'clock when she went over to watch their show together like they did every afternoon . She came into my workroom , not going fast or even out of breath . " June 's dead , " she told me . I looked up . The sun was square behind her and I could n't see a thing . " Dead ? " " In her kitchen . You better come on . " 195  | I put down my screwdriver and balanced myself against the workbench . " You call an ambulance ? " " She 's dead , " Sister Evangeline said , " not sick . " I walked back through the pasture with Sister and she held onto my arm . No one could be sure how old Sister was , though by my calculations she must have been well past eighty by then . She did n't seem more than seventy most days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for too long that I even thought about her age . " Why do n't you wait back up at the hotel ? " I asked Sister . " No sense you going alone , " she said . She puffed a little bit , so I slowed down . She took small , careful steps and what with her being five feet tall and me just at six seven , it was hard for us to get matched up . We went in June 's front door , which was open on account of the weather being so nice . Everything in her house was neat , put right in its place . The sun fell over the living room carpet and showed up how the cabbage roses had faded . " In here , " Sister Evangeline said , and walked into the kitchen . June was lying on the floor and her chair was turned over . The way her mouth was tensed made me think she 'd felt some pain at the last . Sister Evangeline squatted down and closed June 's eyes with two fingers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute . " I wish it was me , " she said kind of matter-of-factly . " Do n't say that . " She stayed down there awhile , just watching her . " Help me up , Son . I never should have gotten down like this . " I leaned over and put my hands under her arms to straighten her up . She was a solid little thing , no doubt about that . " You take her in and put her on the couch so she looks comfortable and I 'll call the funeral home . " She sighed , looked at the table , and then smiled . " She was eating liverwurst , " she said , pointing to the sandwich still sitting on the plate . " That 's good . " I picked June up and carried her into the living room like Sister told me . She did n't weigh any more than Sissy . It was an awful thing to never really have the chance to hold somebody until she was dead . I put her on the couch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , " Sister Evangeline said , hanging up the phone . " He said we should wait here with her . It wo n't take him five minutes . " I helped Sister down into the chair that had been June 's and then sat down myself .  | " This is awful , " I said . " People die , " she said . But I knew it was even harder for her . June was old . Not quite as old as Sister , but old enough for her to talk about the way things had been in these parts when they were growing up . They were friends . Going to June 's every day was what Sister looked forward to , and now that was gone . June was gone . " She wanted to be a Catholic , " Sister Evangeline said to me . I was surprised , I guess , seeing as how much trouble the Catholics had given the Clatterbucks over the years . " A hundred times she said that and I used to always say I 'd give her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around to it . It was almost like she was scared . I should have pressed her , maybe . " " Naw , " I said quietly , " ca n't press a person on something like that . " She nodded . " I guess that 's right . " Then she bent her head down toward her chest and she said , " Eternal rest , grant unto her , 0 Lord , and may perpetual light shine upon her . May her soul and all the souls of the faithfully departed rest in peace . Amen . " She kept on saying it , over and over again , until Hank came up from the funeral home . By the time we got back to Saint Elizabeth 's , Sister Evangeline was pretty worn out . " What 's wrong ? " Rose said , soon as she saw us . She was fixing dinner and pots were boiling all over the place . Her apron was covered in flour . " June 's dead , " Sister said . " I 'm going to lie down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up her hand . " No , honey , I 'm fine . I 'm just tired is all . Let me go on . Son 'll tell you what happened . " She moved off down the hall with her little shuffling steps . " June ? " Rose said . I nodded my head . " Just this afternoon . " Rose sat down and I took her hand . " Poor Sister , " she said , and then added , " poor June . " They buried her with her family , just the way she wanted . All the girls came , even though most of them had never met her . They had all read the plaque in front of the hotel . Everybody felt they owed June the respect . It was always strange to see the girls outside of Saint Elizabeth 's . When they were in the hotel or just walking around the grounds , I never noticed them being pregnant . After a while , you know , you just stop seeing some things . But whenever we went out it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spotlight , and all together they made a wall of round bellies that was nearly impossible not to stare at . The dresses only really fit on one or two of them . The others were wearing things too big or too tight , like they had grown some on the bus coming over . They bowed their heads and said their prayers and tried to ignore the people who were staring at them . Habit and Saint Elizabeth 's did n't have occasion to mix much , but June Clatterbuck 's funeral was something that brought out everyone from both sides of town . Things had gotten better . People did n't mind the sight of pregnant girls the way they used to . The nuns still made them uncomfortable , their long white dresses and their habits flapping behind them like bed sheets on a line , but since there were television shows about nuns now , and a movie from time to time , people were a little more accustomed to the idea of women who were married to God . I stood there with my hands folded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave and we stood on the other : pregnant girls , nuns , and one man too tall to blend in anyplace . Miss June would have gotten a kick out of it , her funeral making such strange bedfellows . " Right beside her mother and father , " Sister Evangeline said to me . " She never got over missing them , not till the day she died . " " Jesus owes us nothing , " the preacher said , " and still He gives us all . He gave June Clatterbuck her life for more than seventy years . He gave us all June to know and love . We have witnessed His goodness through her . " He looked at our side for a minute and then back to the ground . " Hell awaits the sin-ners , " he said . " June walks with the Lord . " Sissy leaned over and scratched a mosquito bite on her ankle . She 'd been crying off and on . I wanted to pick her up , but she only would 've fussed at me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd say every time I tried to pick her up now . It was true , she was getting so big you would have thought she was twelve , all legs and arms . She went to school in town and most of her friends and their parents were there . I could tell she was a little embarrassed standing with us . She would have liked to have been on the other side with the Baptists , even though she was taking being a Catholic very seriously because the nuns were always giving her rosary beads and holy cards and she liked those things a lot . She 'd been good through the whole funeral , stood up straight and was quiet . She did n't complain about having to wear a dress THE PATRON SAINT OF LIARS 199 ar her stiff shoes like she did when she went to mass in the ballroom or up in Owensboro . June was the first one to see Sissy fern over and she heard her first words . Sister Evangeline fussed with Sissy 's hair , picking at it like it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mind that . " Sad stuff , " Sister said . Sissy looked over at the place where the ground was dug up . " Why is n't he saying any of the prayers right ? " she whispered In me , but I put my finger to my Lips and she was quiet . As soon as the service was over Mother Corinne clapped her bands twice to gather everyone together . " All right , girls , " she said . " We need to start back . " You could tell Mother Corinne dd n't take to things not Catholic . It made her nervous , standing in the Baptist cemetery with a preacher . We all climbed on board the Baptist Sunday school bus to go borne . They 'd sent it for us , which I thought was real decent of them . The last of the Clatterbucks was gone . The last real proof that there had ever been a spring that healed the sick . It would all be the church 's now , just like the church had been saying it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rose on the bus . It was funny how I could always tell what she was thinking . I do n't know if it was just because she was mine or if all kids were easy to figure out . She was trying to get in line right behind her , but then at the last minute Rose stepped back to wait for Sister Evangeline and help her on . Sissy sat down next to me and then kneeled on her seat , peering back to watch Rose . " Can we go swimming later ? " she asked her mother . " You do n't go swimming after a funeral , " Rose said . " Turn around and sit down . " " Then I ca n't see you . " " So you ca n't see me , " Rose said . " I 'm not going anywhere . Sit . " Sissy sat down and swung her legs back and forth . I figured she was wishing she was behind Rose now so she could kick the back of her seat . That was the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sissy did n't seem to care if the attention she got from her mother was good or bad , as long as Rose knew she was there . " I hate this , " Sissy said , but I did n't know what she meant : hated the funeral or death or her mother or having to ride home on a bus . She picked up my arm and arranged it over her shoul- ,  | der until she was comfortable . " I would n't ever want to be bur-ied , " she said . " I know what you mean . " " What if she wakes up later ? What if they 're wrong about her being dead . " " They were n't wrong , " I said . " I saw her . I made sure they did n't make a mistake . " " Everybody makes mistakes , " Sissy said . The lawyer who called was from Owensboro . There was n't a lawyer in Habit , which was fine by me . He said I should come up and talk to him about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " You 've been left an inheritance , " the man said . Wills depressed me , more than funerals even . The idea of dividing things up once a person was dead gave me a weird sort of chill . " Come tomorrow , " the lawyer said . " You and your wife should both come . " " I ca n't go to Owensboro , " Rose said when I told her . " Who 'll make lunch ? " " I 'm sure somebody could do it . " " No , " she said . " Whatever it is , you can take care of it . It was good of June to think of us , but I do n't see any sense in both of us taking the day off to go sign papers . " " It might be good for us , taking an afternoon off . We never do get up to Owensboro anymore . " The truth is , Rose and I never went anywhere anymore . Rose never went anywhere . She cooked seven days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get sick or take vacations , she did n't even miss breakfast every now and then . She always had a couple of girls to help her , chopping things or washing dishes , but it was her kitchen now . Sister Evangeline stayed with her all day , but mostly in an old armchair I 'd moved in from the card room . She 'd sit and shell peas and talk to Rose . Sometimes she 'd tell her what she 'd like to have for supper , or she 'd make a banana pudding just to keep her hand in things . Mother Corinne avoided the kitchen whenever possible , coming only rarely to complain about something . She still gave the grocery money to Sister Evangeline , who gave it to Rose . I knew it worried Mother Corinne , how much they needed Rose to do things now . She was always hoping the bishop would send her another sister who would take things over in the kitchen , somebody she could scare  | o doing what she wanted , but nuns were hard to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to and the ones that were alaround were getting old . I used to tell Rose all the time that I thought she was crazy , she should take some time for herself . " I must be doing what I want , " she said . " God knows , they 're laot paying me for it . " " But you need to do other things . Why not go back to California ? Visit your family . You 've never gone back out there . " Rose turned away from me . I was breaking our agreement , tying things like that . We did n't talk about things that came before Habit . Sometimes I wanted to know . It 's one thing for us not have known much about one another when we got martied. but it had been ten years . In a way , I thought nobody knew more about Rose than me . I knew every mood she had sd how long it would last . I knew how she moved and where she went and when she wanted to be left alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish I knew the rest of it , too . Sometimes I thought I 'd even be willing to tell her what had happened to me , tell her everything , if it would have made her tWE to me . It would n't have . I doubt Rose really cared about what I 'd done before . So I drove on up to Owensboro the next morning by myself and found the lawyer 's office , three doors down from the jus-tice 's office where we 'd been married . I wondered if it was still the same guy . I thought about stepping inside to see , but then did n't . I wore my suit , just like I had to June 's funeral . " Mr. Abbott , " the lawyer said , and shook my hand . He was a young fellow with dark , combed-back hair and glasses . " Will your wife not be joining us ? " he asked me . " Not today . " " That 's too bad . This is good news . It 's nice to have everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fact that June Clatterbuck owned a good deal of property in Habit ? " " All the land at Saint Elizabeth 's , " I said . " That 's correct . The Catholic Church owns the structure of Saint Elizabeth 's , but the land itself , her personal home , a barn , that was all hers . " " That 's right , " I said . " She 's left that to you and your wife , Mr. Abbott . The land and the house . " I shook my head . " That could n't be right . There must be other Clatterbucks. "  | " Two nieces in Indiana . Some money has gone to them , but the property is yours . " I sat there for a minute and pulled at the cuffs of my shirt . " Then it was supposed to go to the church . They always wanted that land , acted like it was theirs all along . " " Well , " the lawyer said , " that was n't what Miss Clatterbuck wanted . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the church is on very weak grounds , so to speak . Water rights , access rights , those all belonged to Miss Clatterbuck and now to you . With a certain amount of effort and money , I do n't think it would be impossible to get rid of them . " I put up both of my hands . I did n't want to hear it . " That 's not what anyone wants . " He seemed relieved . " Fine then , all the better . It will take some time to draw up the papers , but no one 's contesting this decision . Miss Clatterbuck had discussed this with her nieces before her death . " " It looks like she told everybody except us . " " I do n't think she wanted to say anything , " he told me . " People can be like that about wills . " I signed a few papers and shook his hand again before I left . I was planning on having a sandwich before I drove back , but now it seemed best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , " come outside . I need to talk to you . " " How did it all go ? " Sister Evangeline said . She smiled at me with her lips pressed tight together , like she could barely keep from laughing out loud , and I knew all of the sudden that she knew . I smiled and shook my head at her . " Come in here and tell me what happened , " Rose said . " I want to watch the soup . " " The soup can watch itself , " Sister Evangeline said . " You made him drive up to Owensboro alone , now at least take a minute to talk to him . " Rose sighed and took the spoon out of the pot and set it on a saucer . " It 's like living with your mother , " she said . " That 's right , " Sister said . Rose came outside and closed the door . It was n't too hot that day and everything was green on the count of good rains all spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I want to take a little walk . " " Then go on , " she said . " A walk with you . " Ili ! ou IIliiul II , ,  | " In your suit ? Go home and change first . " " Sissy is n't home from school yet ? " " She 's in a play , she wo n't be home till four . What is this , ay ? Was there a problem at the lawyer 's ? " " Do n't you want to know what she left us ? " " I hate to ask , " Rose said . I thought how in a way we could be alike , both thinking it bad luck to want anything from a will . " Come on , " I said . took her hand and she let me take it . Rose knew when to give on things . I did n't ask her for very much at all , so maybe she decided this once she 'd go along on my walk . We went past house , down through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be . I remembered one night when me and walked down there , the first time I took her to meet Miss I remembered another time when I found her in the snow , f out of her head , and took her home with me . " It 's pretty here , " I said , stopping in the middle of the field . R was good land . I 'd always thought it would be good for horses . Rose shaded her eyes and looked around . Maybe she was Linking of things that had happened out there , too . " Same as ever . " I sat down in the grass in my suit . I felt a little guilty , because right at that moment I was n't feeling bad about June 's death . I was happy for what I 'd been given . " This is ours , " I said to Rose . " What is ? " " All this . " I waved my hand out in front of me . " June left us the property . Everything underneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all directions . " Rose looked at me . You just do n't see Rose looking surprised . She never cared enough to look surprised about things . " She left it to us ? " " All of it . Her house , too . " Rose sat down next to me and picked at the grass for a minute . " My God , " she said , and shook her head . We sat there for a while , with our arms crossed over our knees , and watched the land to see if it had changed somehow . " I came here almost eleven years ago , " Rose said , staring straight out in front of her . " I was going to be here six months . " " I was going to be here three days , " I said . " And that 's been more than thirty-five years . " We were quiet for a while , just taking it all in , and then Rose said , " They ought to put up a sign , warning people . "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just could n't settle down . I wanted to walk over every inch of the land and look at it again . Thirty-five years I had been tending to the trees and pulling the ivy out of the flower beds . I watched fields sit empty so many good summers and thought they should have let me put out corn or soy like I asked but Mother Corinne said I should n't take the time away from work . In the fall every maple on the south hill would turn red and in the winter the drive would still need shoveling , but it would all be different now . I was fifty-five years old when June died , and in those fiftyfive years I had owned nothing , not the house that I lived in or the truck that I used for hauling . I ca n't say that I ever thought about it too much , at least not the way other men do . When I was growing up , I always thought about the things I wanted in terms of what Cecilia and I would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world went with her . I just never thought about things like that anymore . If I gave my life over to working on my own land or somebody else 's , it did n't really make a difference to me . By the time I got married and Sissy was born , I was set in my ways . I never thought about getting something for them . But having it fall to me the way it did changed things . I just kept looking at the ground , the same dirt and the same tough grass , but no one could tell me to get off of it now . I was n't beholden to anyone , not Mother Corinne or the church . It was no one 's kindness that was letting me stay on . I could get old and not worry . I could die and Rose and Sissy would n't have to worry . I went over to June 's house and went inside . It felt strange , not knocking . The last time I 'd been there was the day she died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of how much sun came in and how tight the window casements were sealed . I ran a finger over the rose-covered wallpaper in the hall . I studied the light fixtures . There was a bedroom downstairs that had been June 's and two more large bedrooms upstairs . I 'd never been upstairs before , and I had to bend my head down to keep from hitting it on the low sloping ceiling over the staircase . Both of the rooms were made up real pretty , like June was expecting someone to come and stay , but I did n't remember her having guests . I sat down on the edge of the bed and folded my hands . I thought about waking up here every morning from now on and I put my feet up on the bed and stretched out . It was just starting  | to get dark outside . The girls would be coming off the porch of Saint Elizabeth 's pretty soon and in for Rose 's dinner . None of them knew that all they had been looking at belonged to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Rose . Sissy could be right across the hall . When she got older and wanted more privacy she could move into the bedroom downstairs , and after she grew up and got married and I got too old to climb the stairs , I could move into that bedroom . I walked back down and looked at the kitchen . It was plenty big enough . I could make new cabinets and tear up the linoleum on the floor , make it someplace Rose would want to be . Then every once in a while we 'd eat dinner at home , the three of us . I stopped and read a note taped to the refrigerator . " Milk , tomatoes , Cheerios , corn meal , " it said . I pulled it off , folded it , and slipped it inside my suit pocket . I headed back to Saint Elizabeth 's in the dark and went inside through the kitchen door . Rose was sitting by herself at the table with her feet propped up on a chair . She was staring out the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person got to see Rose sitting still , and I watched her for a while . " Where 's Sissy ? " I said finally . She looked up at me , almost like she 'd been waiting for me . " She 's eating with them tonight , " she said , and tilted her head toward the dining room . " You getting used to all this ? " " It 's a lot to think about , " Rose said . " You bet . " " Look at you , " she said . " You 're still in your suit . " " I went over to June 's and looked around . I 'm thinking we should move over there . It 's a lot bigger . I figured I could pack up all her personal stuff and send it to her nieces . I do n't know . The lawyer could tell us what to do . " " We could go there , I guess , " Rose said . " I 've been thinking , I do n't want to tell Cecilia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The inheritance , the land . I do n't think it 's a good idea . " I sat down next to her at the little table . She kept looking off out the window . " She 's too young . She 's better off thinking that we do n't have anything , " Rose said . " She 'll work harder , then . I do n't want her to spend her life planning on staying here . She should n't think there 's any reason for her to stay . There is n't . But if she knew that this was all going to wind up being hers ,  | she might not ever look any farther than the end of the drive-way . " I wanted to tell Sissy . I wanted to pick her up in the air and swing her around and give her the land as a gift . " I do n't want to lie to her about it , though , " I said . " I do n't think that would be right . " " Why not ? " Rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Jesus , what a thing to say . " Rose put up her hand . " No , " she said . " Forget that . I 'm sorry . Tell her we 're going to move to June 's because it 's bigger . Tell her Saint Elizabeth 's owns it . I do n't think she 'll ask any questions anyway . " Rose got up and peered through the swinging door to see if everyone was about finished eating . I just sat there , staring at my hands on the green-topped table . " I am her father , " I said quietly . Rose stopped and looked back at me over her shoulder . " I did n't mean it that way , " she said . " I know what you meant , " I said . " I 'm always here . Every day for ten years . Do n't tell me I 'm not her father . " " Yes , " she said , like suddenly she understood what I was saying . " Of course you are . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I walked her over to June 's and told her which bedroom would be hers . She was in fourth grade then and smart as a whip . She acted just like me , going through a house she 'd been in all her life like she 'd never seen it before . " What if it 's haunted ? " she called out from the bathroom , where she was turning the shower off and on . " June was n't the haunting type , " I said . " Even if she was , she 'd haunt the creek bed , not the house . " " I ca n't imagine living in somebody else 's house is all . " She opened the hall closet and looked inside . " This is full of coats . " " We 'll have to box everything up . " I looked inside . It looked like there were coats from her whole family , like everyone who had ever been there had left a coat behind . " Mom wants to do this ? " Sissy said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as long as she does n't have to walk too far to work . " I took a gray felt hat off of the top shelf and put it on Sissy 's head . She folded back the brim in the front .  | " How do I look ? " she said . " Good , " I said , and nodded . " Very good . " I could n't help but think she 'd never be pretty like Rose . Sometimes I would stare at her so hard while she was sleeping , trying to see the smallest bit of her mother , in the eyes or around the mouth , but Sissy just looked like Sissy , no one else . Everything happened so slowly at Saint Elizabeth 's that to see a change you had to wait and watch for years . But that 's what I 'd done and so I knew things . The girls were getting younger . Every year had one girl who set a new record . We 'd had them seventeen and then sixteen . Over time a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had to have a psychologist and a social worker come down with the doctor once a week . The sisters held regular classes for the girls so they could keep ap with their studies . They came from farther away . Not as far as California , but you could tell , these places were shutting down . There were fewer and fewer places a girl could go . Other things had changed , too . Sissy got so big that most of the girls stopped trying to baby her . Sister Evangeline passed out the futures of unborn children without a thought to getting in trouble , and Mother Corinne got used to Rose , but she never liked her . She always acted like Rose was some kind of hangeron who 'd give up one day and go home . She never thanked Rose for the work she did or how she took care of Sister Evangeline . So when Mother Corinne found occasion to come into the kitchen every now and then to fuss at Rose about something , buying expensive olives or a new blender , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seen it happen , Mother Corinne would be ranting and raving and half the time Rose would n't even look up from what she was doing . But once we got June 's house cleaned out and started to carry our things across the back pasture , Mother Corinne decided to take offense at everything Rose was doing . You could n't blame her in a way . All those years she 'd been acting like the land was hers and then all of the sudden it was n't . She did n't hold it against me or Sissy , but the thought of Rose having it drove her half mad . Except that Mother Corinne did n't really get mad , she just got firm and found ways of talking to you that made you feel small and smaller . One day just before we moved in , right after lunch , she came into the kitchen looking like her eyes were on fire . " All through that meal I had to sit there and watch the waste , "  | she said to Rose , the soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice as much food on every plate as the girls could eat . That 's food that will be thrown away . " Her hands moved like quick knives in the air . Sister Evangeline and I sat at the table and watched . We had n't seen her like this in a long time , but Rose hardly noticed . " I did n't see plates coming back with food on them . No more or less than usual , " Rose said . " I do n't know where you come from , " Mother Corinne said . " Who taught you to lie the way you do . " Rose started to turn away from her , then all of the sudden she cocked her head a little to one side , like she was trying to hear a song playing on the radio in the other room . She had a heavy wooden spoon in her hand and she turned back to Mother Corinne . " No more , " she said . Her voice was low and steady and she moved the spoon slowly back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have this , " Mother Corinne said , not hearing her , not knowing that anything had changed . But I knew it and Sister Evangeline knew it . Rose had changed her mind about what she was going to take . " Leave , " Rose said . " You wo n't tell me where to go , " Mother Corinne said . " You 're here through my good graces , you and your daughter both . " Rose raised up her spoon and Sister Evangeline said , " Rose , you come here ! " and Rose turned around . Mother Corinne looked at the three of us in horror , like she did n't know who was worse . She was too angry to speak . I had never seen her so mad . But when she got to the door Rose called out to her . " My good graces , " Rose said . " Not yours . " After that , I do n't remember Mother Corinne coming into the kitchen again . It was a big hotel . You could avoid someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new house I went to tuck Sissy in . " Here we go , " she said . " You brush your teeth ? " She nodded . " Say your prayers ? " " Twice . " " That 's the way you 're supposed to do it . " I sat down on the edge of her bed and pulled the sheet up under her chin . I looked at her there on her white pillow , her hair all spread out like a fan , and I thought about June 's father . He had died before I ever  | came to Habit , but June loved to tell stories about him , how he had saved her life . He would have watched his daughter bent with fever in this house , maybe in this room , and thought about how he 'd do anything for her . " Show me where I am , " Sissy said . She had n't asked me that in more than a year . When she was little she used to say it all the time . It meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my arm . I took off my shirt and pulled up the sleeve of my undershirt . " Right there , " I said . " So you 'll never forget my birthday . " " Not unless I do n't take a bath that day , " I said . " Cecilia and Rose , " Sissy said . " Both of you right there . " I tapped my arm . " But the rose is n't right because the tattoo girl 's mother came home before it was finished and she got scared and dropped the needle , " she said . She used to make me tell the story over and over again . " When I was born you went to Mamie 's house and had her put my name on your arm and the day I was born and a rose for Mom . " " You 've got a good memory , " I said . " You 've told me about a million times , " she said , sounding sleepy . " Good night . " " And if you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have put all their names on your arm , all the dates . And if you 'd had even more kids you would have gone to the other arm and then your legs , and then your back . " " Good night . " " Until they 'd be putting the names on the soles of your feet and the back of your neck . Charlie , Thomas , Mary , Douglas , Lee Ann , Susan , Octavia . " " Octavia ? " " I go to school with a girl named Octavia . " " Good night , " I said , and closed the door but not all the way . " Good night , " she said . I went across the hall and got in bed with Rose . She reached up and turned off the lights . I kissed her good night on the forehead , but she did n't say anything . That night I dreamed about Cecilia . It was a dream I had n't had in a long time , the one where she comes and sits down on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Son ? "  | " Okay , I guess . Good , really . This is our house now . We moved . You look good . " She was wearing a dark green dress , one I 'd never seen before . " I look just the same , " she said , and ran her fingers through her hair . Her hair was just the way she used to wear it . It was a real forties style , neat and waved . I liked hair that way . " Have you been doing all right ? " She nodded , she seemed a little more tired than usual , but like I said , it had been years since I 'd had this dream . " Not a lot happens , you know ? I think that 's the point of the whole thing . " She leaned over and touched Rose 's cheek gently with the back of her hand . " She has such nice skin , " Cecilia whispered . " She 's just so pretty . I wish she was n't so pretty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her steady breathing was a comfort . " She 's no prettier than you , " I said . " We 're different , " Cecilia said . " I always thought you 'd marry someone like me . " " Who 's like you ? " I asked , and took her hand . Cecilia bent her head down a little and smiled . She always needed to know she was special . " I 'm going to go and look at your daughter , " she said . " Is that all right ? I wo n't wake her up . " Sure , " I said . Dying had made Cecilia humble . She was easier to get along with , but I kind of missed the way she used to be . She gave my hand a squeeze . " You take care of yourself , now , " she said . " Get some sleep . " " You too , " I said . She got up slowly , like she did n't really want to go , but she did . She waved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pitch-dark and I felt scared to death . I never got used to those dreams and I thought it was bad luck to have one the first night in the new house . I sat up in bed and tried to adjust my eyes to the light . There was a woman standing at the foot of the bed wearing a dress . I could hardly breathe . " Cecilia ? " I said . " She 's asleep , " Rose said . " It 's just me . Go back to sleep . " I reached up and turned on a lamp at the bedside table . It took me a minute to find the switch because I was n't used to it . " Why are you dressed ? " " I 'm going to go home , " she said . I honestly had no idea-what she meant . " California ? " She smiled and shook her head . " I 'm going back to the old house . I ca n't sleep . "  | " Do n't be silly , Rose . Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said softly . " I need to get going . " I got up and pulled my bathrobe on . She had her little suitcase in her hands and she saw me staring at it . " I just needed a few things , " she said . I followed her downstairs , through our new living room and out onto the front porch . " If you do n't like it here , we 'll go back , " I said . " We do n't have to stay here . The other house is fine . " " Go back to bed , Son , " she said , walking down the stairs . " Do n't worry about anything . Everything 's fine . " I took hold of her hand and she gave me a funny little smile that I knew meant I was supposed to let go . She did n't say anything else or look back over her shoulder and there was nothing I could do but watch her walking away , getting smaller and smaller in the dark field . There were so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night being so pretty like that and her leaving . It was happening all over again . She was going and I was letting her go . I stood on the porch and waited until from far away I saw a little light go on in the front room of the house I had lived in thirty-five years . I sat down on the steps and kept my eyes on that light , thinking , that 's where my wife is.  | I SAW HER when I came home from school . She was standing in front of Saint Elizabeth 's reading the sign , so I knew what that meant . When I was a kid I used to run out as soon as I saw somebody at the sign but my mother told me to leave them alone , let them come in on their own time . When I passed this girl she sort of looked up a little and I nodded at her and smiled and she went right back to reading . It was n't like she was snubbing me or anything , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was talking to Sister Bernadette at the front desk . She had a letter for me from my pen pal in Spain , who , thank God , had been writing to me in English . My Spanish is rotten . We were matched up through our schools because we were both fifteen , girls , and studying each other 's language , though clearly one of us was more successful at it than the other . Sister Bernadette was telling me that when she was in convent school she had a pen pal who was taking holy orders in Italy . " Her name was Maria Theresa , " Sister Bernadette said . " We lost touch after the war . " I tapped the letter on the desk . I liked getting mail here better than at the house . Not that I got any mail except from Sylvia , who , according to her letters , had a life even more boring than mine . Sister Bernadette put everybody 's name on a key box behind the front desk and sorted the mail out like she was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could be peeled off easily and replaced with new ones . There were some things about the old hotel that were cool , like the attic and all the boxes behind the desk . " Got a new customer outside , " I said . I checked out the stamps , which were infinitely better than American stamps , plus it took like five of them to mail a letter .  | Sister Bernadette went to the window and raised up on her toes to look over the top of the half sheers . " Poor thing , " she said . " She 's been there two hours now . I wish she 'd come inside . " I shrugged . " At least the weather 's good . " Sister nodded , and with that the door opened a little bit and the girl crept inside . It was like she 'd heard us talking about her . I dropped down on the couch and slid my finger underneath the flap of the envelope . I was trying not to listen and trying to listen while the girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was hard to imagine being that thin and pregnant too . She had a ton of red curly hair that was caught up in a ponytail holder . It looked more like bundled kindling than hair . I started to read Sylvia 's letter . It was all about her father acquiring more goats . She used the queerest words . Acquiring goats . " Wait here , dear , " Sister Bernadette said . " I 'll see if I ca n't get Mother Corinne . " The girl came over and sat down on the couch next to me . I should n't say next to me . She sat on the same couch as me but as far away as possible . She looked like she was going to be sick , and let me tell you , it 's happened before . I 've seen girls throw up in their purses waiting to be interviewed . The first three months and then again in the last month . That 's when everybody throws up . She looked up and saw me there for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . " I smiled again . She looked like a rabbit caught in a trap . Her eyes darted from side to side , but so fast you could barely tell it was happening . We were the only two people in the lobby . It was the standard nap hour at the baby farm . " I 'm Lorraine , " she said , and stuck out her hand like she was trying to get my vote . " Cecilia . " I leaned over the couch , not exactly getting up , and shook it . I always feel so stupid shaking people 's hands . " I just got here , " she said . She was checking out the carpet and the horse paintings . This was not a girl who 'd been in a big hotel before . Not even a shabby one . " I know . I saw you outside . " " Oh , " she said , and nodded , thinking it all over . " Do n't worry about it , " I said . " It 's fine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so good at the Welcome Wagon stuff . There was a time I got into it , but after a while you figure it out : everybody comes and everybody goes .  | " Oh , it looks nice . That nun " Lorraine pulled at a few of her curls and I was impressed by the way they sprang right back into place when she let them go " she seemed nice . " " Very nice , " I said . She smiled and I smiled , and then the whole thing got a little awkward . I did n't want to just stare at her , and I did n't want to get up and leave . " I 'm going to read my letter , " I said , and held up the light blue airmail paper like it was proof of something . Not that Sylvia 's father 's latest goat acquisition was really burning a hole in my curiosity . Sylvia did n't get out too much . She had never been to a bullfight . I do n't mean to stereotype or anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you never go to a bullfight ? " Do n't let me keep you , " Lorraine said , and made a sudden jerking motion with her hand , like she was trying to catch a glass of water she 'd just knocked over in the air . It made both of us jump a little . " Nervous , " she said , and then looked like she was going to cry . I 've seen that too . I put the letter back in its envelope . " Do n't be nervous , " I said . " Look , I 'll tell you . " I checked over my shoulder to see if Sister Bernadette had come back . Not that she would n't agree with what I was going to say , but she would n't like to hear me say it . " Mother Corinne is a little bit of a hard ass . Not awful , but it 's best to get off on the right foot . Are you Catholic ? " " No , " Lorraine said , her eyes getting absolutely round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services " " Ah , " I said , cutting her off . " That 's not the point . You do n't have to be , but it makes things easier . Just tell her you are . " " But I 'm not . " " There is n't a test . She wo n't ask you to say the stations of the cross or anything . It 's just " I turned my eyes to the large portrait of Saint Elizabeth over the front desk , the crucifix over every door " polite or something . If you do n't want to do it , do n't do it . They wo n't kick you out . " " Anything else ? " My mother probably did n't even know I knew this , even though I 'd seen her take a hundred girls aside and tell them . " The guy who got you pregnant . Do n't say he 's dead . Everybody does that . It makes Mother Corinne crazy . " Lorraine put her hands under her thighs and sat on them like they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was going to say that , " she said finally . " See ? " " So what do I tell her ? "  | " I do n't know . Tell her the truth . Or tell her you do n't re-member . " " What did you tell her ? " Lorraine said . All of a sudden I was the one who was wide-eyed . I started to explain , I opened my mouth , but then Sister Bernadette was there to take her back to the office . " Wish me luck , " she said , and picked up her bag . I sat there , absolutely frozen . I felt like I had just been mistaken for some escaped mass murderer . I felt like I was going to be sick , but that would only have proved her assumption . No one had ever , ever , mistaken me for one of them , not even as a joke . The lobby felt small and airless . I thought I was going to pass out . I got up and went outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wanted to go home , to my home , where I lived with my father . I cut through a hole in the hedge and started out across the back pasture . Halfway to the house I dropped my books and Sylvia 's letter and the sweater I had n't needed all day and fell down in the grass . There 's maybe a week in every year you can do this . It comes after the mud has dried up and before all the bees are out . I had never had sex , and not because I was so righteous and good . No one had asked me . If someone had asked me , though , I 'd like to think I would have said no . Let me tell you , I 've seen it . From day one I 've heard the stories of girls who said yes . He was going to marry me , he promised . People tell me things you would n't believe . It 's like there 's a sign over my head : CONFIDE HERE . But who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nun how it makes you feel to have him look at you and say your name ? Going to tell another pregnant girl ? Big chance of sympathy there . Better to tell some kid who 's around and probably wo n't remember . But I do remember . There 's a recorder turned on somewhere inside me . Everything stays . Mary Claire , who could n't sleep alone during thunderstorms and so checked me out from my mother like I was a library book , told me she 'd done it at thirteen . Cheryl told me that she always believed it could n't happen your first time , but she 'd only done it once and there she was . She also said it hurt . There had always been a huge gap between me and the girls who came through Saint Elizabeth 's . They were older and away from their families and stuck in the middle of a big adventure they had n't planned on having . I was never one of them . That  | was because of sex . It showed on me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they saw it , too . So there I was , lying in the back pasture with my head on a geometry book , thinking this : things are changing . Now they 're going to start thinking I 'm one of them . It was like seeing an eclipse when it never occurred to you in your wildest dreams that the moon could block out the sun . Not that I 'm saying I 'm the sun or anything . I 'm the caretaker 's daughter . I 'm the cook 's daughter . I 'm not one of them . " Sissy ! " I about jumped out of my skin . I sat up like a shot and saw my father running across the field . My father has a bad knee , so it 's not often you see him running anywhere . " What ! " I called out . " Jesus , girl , you scared me half to death . " He stopped about ten feet away from me and put his hands on his bent legs and started to pant . He went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! " I stood up and went to him , put my hand on his back . " What is it ? What 's wrong ? " He shook his head and took a couple of deep breaths . " I just saw you lying there , " he said . He stopped and wiped his forehead with his sleeve , then he sat down . " Do n't ever do that . " " Do what ? Think ? Be alone ? Lie down ? " I sat down next to him . He did n't look good , really . " Dad . Hey , Dad . Look , I 'm fine . " He nodded , closing his eyes . " You 're fine , " he said . I waited for him to say something else , but he seemed too busy breathing . I scratched the knee of his overalls . " You 're scaring me , " I said quietly . " Here , lie down a second . It 's nice out here . See ? That 's all I was doing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My father did what I told him and stretched out in the moss and bluegrass . He took one huge , long breath , held it and then let it go . " This is better , " he said . " I 'm okay now . " " Were you looking for me ? " " No , I was just going home . I wanted to find my ball peen hammer . I thought it might be at home . " " It 's in the junk drawer , " I told him . I put my hand just above his face to keep the sun out of his eyes . " Next to the fridge . I saw it there yesterday . " " Good girl , " he said . " You feeling okay ? "  | He opened his eyes and smiled at me . " I guess I should n't run . Or I should start running . One or the other . " There was something about the fact that my father was so big that made it scary to see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , you did n't notice how much space he took up . But when he was still like this he looked like a tree that had fallen over and would n't ever be able to set itself right again . He 'd turned sixty last year . The sisters threw him a big party . Most of the kids I went to school with had grandparents who were sixty , not parents . " What were you doing out here ? " my father said . " Getting some sun ? " " Just thinking . " " Anything interesting ? " What was I going to tell him ? That I was thinking about sex ? That I had just realized I could be an unwed mother ? " I was thinking maybe we could have dinner at home tonight . I 'll cook for a change . How about that ? " My father looked up at me . It unnerved me , the looks he could give . " What 's your mother going to say if we do n't go to dinner ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were gone before she could say anything . " " Sissy , " he said , his voice suddenly going stern . " Okay , okay . I 'm not trying to start anything . I 'd just like a night away from the baby farm is all . A little time at home . " He nodded and I saw some relief in his eyes , but maybe just because I wanted to . He must get tired of it . He 's over there all the time . " That 's fair , " he said . He took another deep breath and then stood up . " Come on and walk me home . Show me where the hammer is . " I got up and tied my sweater around my waist and got my books together . " I got another letter from Sylvia , " I said . " Another one ? That girl must have an awful lot of time on her hands . " He reached over and took my books . I did n't want him to carry them , but I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like he was feeble or something . " What 's new in Spain ? " he asked me . " Nothing , " I said . " I 've about decided that Spain is the most boring place in the world . " When Dad and I got to the house to look for the hammer , I knew right away my mother had been there . There was a skirt folded up on the kitchen table and a new bar of clear yellow  | band soap next to the sink . She still came by every now and then , almost always when she knew we 'd be gone . She would leave some small offering : apples , a dishtowel , magazines . Dad noticed right away . He took everything as a sign of something good . " Look at this , " he said , and held up the skirt . It was short and violet with kick pleats . She had made it herself . " This is Pretty . " I took the skirt from him and put it back down on the table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That color is fine for you , " he said . He looked down at the skirt and ran his hand over the cloth like it was a sleeping cat . " She must have made it . " " So she made it , " I said , and opened the refrigerator , not looking for anything . " Be nice , " my father said . He was n't telling me , he was asking me . Please , be nice about your mother . It was important to Dad 's complex system of denial that Mom and I got along . That way he could believe that we were just a normal , happy family who were temporarily living in separate houses . " I am nice , " I said , shutting the refrigerator door . " We do n't have any food . Can you take me to the store ? " He wagged the ball peen hammer in the air . " Got to get back to work , " he said . " You and I can have dinner any night . Maybe we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could feel a bad mood coming on . I 'd made up my mind . " No , " I said . " I'li go over and borrow some stuff . I want to cook . " He sighed and slipped the hammer into the bib pocket of his overalls . " Suit yourself , " he said . He smiled and patted my head . My father was so much bigger than me , than everyone , that it did n't seem condescending when he patted my head . It was like that was the part of everyone he mostly saw . It made sense that it was the part he 'd feel the most affection for . " You 're okay ? " " You bet . " " I 'll be home by six , then . " And with that he went out the kitchen door and across the field . His gray hair looked coarse and bristly in the sunlight . I 'd cut it way too short again . I went up to my room and tried on the skirt . The truth was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how long things ought to be . I stood in front of the mirror and looked at myself , trying to see what Lorraine had seen . I turned to the side and pulled  | the skirt tight over my stomach . I stared inside my eyes so hard it scared me and I had to look away . Kicking off my shoes , I climbed on top of my bed to see my whole body in the mirror over my dresser . I was looking for my mother , looking for cheekbones and long legs and a wide mouth . I could have looked all day and not found a shred of evidence . Once when I was twelve I accused my parents of adopting me . I had it all worked out in my mind : they had n't been able to have children of their own . They had grown close to one of the girls there . The girl died , but just before she did she begged my parents to take me and raise me as their own . The girl who was my real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Or did n't raise me , as the case may be . I thought about my dead mother , how she was skinny like me and not quite tall enough . She had my dirty blond hair and pale skin , a very slight overbite . She was a good dancer , even though she was shy . I thought about how heartsick she would have been to know the many ways this woman she gave me to , entrusted me to , had let me down . After months of fantasizing about this so hard that I was absolutely positive , I went to my parents with my story . My mother , without saying a word , pushed her chair back from the table and left the kitchen . My dad looked pale , so pale I was sure I was right . " I 'm right , " I said in her absence . " Of course you 're not right , " he said helplessly . A few minutes later my mother returned and slapped a piece of paper down on the table . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I read it over carefully . My mother 's name , Martha Rose Abbott . My father 's name , Wilson Eugene Abbott . My name , Cecilia Helen Abbott . " Helen 's a stupid name , " I said . I was furious about losing that good dead mother I had imagined . It was as if she had been murdered . " Helen is my mother 's name , " she said , folding the paper back up and slipping it into her apron pocket . I hung the skirt in my closet and pulled my jeans back on . Then I headed over to Saint Elizabeth 's . We had worn a path between our house and the hotel . Like goats , my father and I followed the same trail back and forth a dozen times a day . Sometimes the sight of the field rubbed bare in a line would make me angry . I 'd walk in the grass two feet beside it for no good reason . I went in the kitchen door to avoid seeing any of the girls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was alone , sitting in her big armchair near the stove . Soft yellow tufts of stuffing came out of the arms where she 'd worn the fabric through . It was getting to be the time of year when it would be too warm for her there . Then my father would move her chair closer to the open window and then finally next to the door of the big walk-in refrigerator when it got really hot in July and August . " I 'm like a little houseplant , " Sister Evangeline would say whenever my father picked up her chair with her still in it and moved it to the next logical spot . " I just need to be kept in the sun . " Not too far from her comfortable chair was a wheelchair folded up and resting against the wall . That was a recent addition . Sister could walk , but not for very long . She would n't sit in her wheelchair during the day , though . She thought it made her look like an invalid . My mother helped her back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asleep in her chair , my mother would just pick her up in her arms . My mother had started buying staples in large bags years ago ; fifty pounds of flour , fifty pounds of rice . She bought entire flats of canned tomatoes from a wholesaler in Louisville . She saved the place money and worked up the shape of a bodybuilder to boot . My mother was two inches shy of six feet tall , and the sight of her walking down the hall with Sister Evangeline asleep in her arms always made me want to cry . " Hey there , lambchop , " Sister Evangeline said to me , wide awake and happy for company . I leaned over and gave her a kiss , and she slapped my cheek hard enough to make me think she 'd live forever . " How are you feeling ? " I poked a long strand of white hair back up under her coif . " Good , " she said . " Old . Nothing new there . God made this body , and He 's going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She laughed a little at her own joke . " What about you ? " I shrugged , unfolded the wheelchair , and sat down next to her . " Fine , I guess . I 'm in a mood . " " Sweet Lorraine , " Sister said . I 'd grown up with Sister Evangeline . My mother said she was the first person at Saint Elizabeth 's to hold me . So let 's just say I was used to this kind of thing . " Lorraine , " I said . " Listen , pet , just you have some sympathy . This is n't any sign from God , this is just Lorraine coming in and having a lot of other things on her mind . " She stopped and tapped the side of her head for effect . " Things besides you . Imagine that ! She 'd  | be thinking of things other than you . " She took my hand and patted it hard , but none of this was improving my mood . " Do n't be sour . This is your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were born . Folks forget that a place that 's easy to live in can be hard to grow up in . They 're not the same thing . There was always going to come a time when you 'd be mistaken for one of them . It will happen again . You 've got to remember , they 're good girls , same as you . Only difference is the babies . You 're just going to have to steady yourself . " What Sister Evangeline had to say did n't cheer me up so much as just being around her did . She told everyone their problems were silly . She sweetly dismissed everything that was laid out before her . I guess when you get to be that old you have a better sense of what a real problem is . " Give me a saint , " I said . " What is the date today ? " " May fifteenth . " Sister Evangeline closed her eyes for a minute and folded her hands in her lap . This was her favorite game . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she would give me a saint as a reward . Now she waited for me to ask her so she could show the things she still remembered . " May fifteenth is the feast day of Saint Isidore , the farmer . He lived in Spain and watches over your friend Sylvia . " I pulled my legs up into the wheelchair and put my head down on my arm . " He was very poor . Poor all his life He always worked for the same man and was a faithful servant . He had a wife , too " she looked at me to make her point " also a saint . When Saint Isidore guided his plow he talked with God or his guardian angel or to other saints . But I should n't say other saints , since he did n't know he was a saint himself at that time . That 's the tricky part about being a saint . If you ever think of yourself as one it throws you out of the running . I 've known people who thought they were saints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were anything but . " She stopped . " Saint Isidore , " I said , guiding her back to her story . " Every moment of his life he was with God . Once he carried a bushel of corn to the mill to be ground into flour and it was winter . On the way he saw the branches over his head were filled with tiny birds , all starving to death in the cold . So Saint Isidore opened his sack and poured half of it on the ground , even though his friends made fun of him for being so sentimental . When they arrived at the mill , his sack was full again , and when it was  | ground , his corn turned into twice the meal . That 's the way God works . He rewards the ones who give things away . " " They made him a saint for feeding the birds ? That does n't sound especially sainted . " Sister Evangeline waved her hand in the air , dismissing my stupidity . " Of course not . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was dead . It 's just that the part with the birds is the part I really like . That 's the part that speaks well of God , that He would notice what was done for birds . " I remained unconvinced and Sister Evangeline smiled at me . " It will be the last , great project of my life to make a Catholic out of you , " she said . " That 's why God 's keeping me alive so long . " " I am a Catholic , " I said . " A better Catholic , like Saint Isidore . " " You want me to be a saint ? " I asked . I was incredulous . I tried to imagine myself , Saint Cecilia , starving in a garret somewhere , giving my last crust of bread to some pathetic , needy squirrel . Was n't there enough to worry about already ? She read my thoughts like they were running on a screen over my head . " Why not shoot high ? " she said . " I remember the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you said your vows and I was so proud of you , I thought , this girl could be a saint . " " Please . " " It 's not impossible , " she said . Just then my mother came into the kitchen , her hands full of radishes . " Take these for me , " she said , and held out her hands to me . I took the radishes , their roots clumped with dirt , and put them in the sink . " Do n't you think Cecilia could be a saint ? " Sister Evangeline asked . My mother dropped her chin to her chest and looked up , the way she did whenever she thought things were simply ridiculous . " Cecilia is n't a saint . She 's a person , just like the rest of us . " I would never expect my mother to think I could be a saint . " Saints are people first , " Sister Evangeline said . " They 're just very good people . You could be a saint , Rosie . Any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's possible . A person just needs guidance , they need faith . And you should get that faith from your parents . You should be telling her these things , Rose , not me . " Sister Evangeline turned to me , but spoke a little
