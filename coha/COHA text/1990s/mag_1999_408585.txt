See Many Files at Once With Thumbnail View // BOTH WINDOWS 98 and Windows 95 with the Desktop Update portion of Internet Explorer 4. x installed provide a handy way to take a quick peek at the contents of files in common Web formats ( HTML , GIF , JPEG , and so on ) : just make sure As Web Page is checked on the View menu of any Explorer or folder window . Then select a file to see the preview in the column on the left . Using this Web-view mode does require you to select one file at a time . Fortunately , you can make all the files in a folder appear as previews to help you quickly find what you need . This feature is especially useful if you work with multiple graphics files or want to visually identify the Web sites in your Favorites folder ( see FIGURE 1 ) . If only Microsoft had n't made this feature so hard to find . Navigate to one of the folders in your Favorites folder ( it 's located in the Windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the folder window and choose Properties . Check the Enable thumbnail view box at the bottom , and click OK . Right-click an empty area again , and this time choose Refresh . If you do n't see thumbnails at once , choose View-Thumbnails . ( If you do n't see a Thumbnails command on the menu , close and reopen the folder . ) Unless you recently visited the sites , your thumbnails may appear as a series of nearly empty boxes . To fix that , connect to the Internet and press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-A to select all thumbnails within the folder . Right-click one of these thumbnails and choose Refresh Thumbnail . ( If you use this technique on a folder of GIF or JPEG files , you do n't need to connect to the Net . ) What 's up with Thumbs.db . If a folder 's options are set to let you view all files , you may see a new file called Thumbs.db in that folder . This is the folder 's thumbnails database . If you do n't see Thumbs.db , choose View-Folder Options , click @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Advanced settings list , and click OK . Each folder with a thumbnail view will have its own Thumbs.db file ; and the more files a folder contains , the larger its Thumbs.db file will be . So if you 're getting tight on disk space , it pays to keep track of how much space these files occupy . To see their cumulative size , choose Start . Find.Files or Folders , type Thumbs.db in the Name field , choose Local hard drives for " Look in ' ' , and click Find Now . Press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-A to select all the found files , and press **25;2288;TOOLONG to display a Properties dialog box that shows the total disk space consumed . If thumbnails are crowding your hard drive , consider changing the View menu setting to something other than Thumbnails . Then display the Properties for the folder as explained above , and uncheck Enable thumbnail view . Doing this deletes the Thumbs.db file for that folder . Repeat for as many folders as desired . Try to remember . Forget which folders you enabled for thumbnail viewing ? Search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Find window provide a quick reminder . ( The Find window wo n't , however , show folders that have the feature enabled but contain no thumbnailssuch as an empty folder or one containing only unsupported file formats . ) Accidents will happen . If you accidentally delete a Thumbs.db file , do n't worry . Windows will re-create the file and the thumbnails the next time you view the folder . If they do n't appear then , use the Refresh Thumbnail command explained earlier . Wrapping woes . Often , folders with thumbnails align improperly across the folder window when you resize the window . Align them properly by pressing &lt;FS&gt; . Deletion dilemma . In Win 98 , if you delete a folder containing thumbnails and then empty the Recycle Bin , you may get an " Access denied " error message saying that the disk may be full or write-protected , or that the file in question is in use . Microsoft confirms this bug in its KnowledgeBase ( **28;2315;TOOLONG ) . To avoid this error , close Windows Explorer before emptying the Recycle Bin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managing image files , anyone who handles lots of images should consider getting a dedicated utility for handling the job . PolyView , my favorite , maintains the familiar Explorer-like interface but lets you choose the size of the thumbnails , gives you more options for sorting and managing files , and includes many basic image-editing features . PolyView is available as $25 shareware . Download it from PC World Online 's FileWorld site or from www.polybytes.com . PUT ' MY DOCUMENTS ' IN ITS PLACE WHEN YOU INSTALL Windows 98 , it creates a folder called My Documents and creates a desktop icon of the same name for quick access to that folder . ( You may already have such a folder if you 've installed certain other Microsoft products , such as Office 95 . ) By default , all Microsoft applications ( including Paint and WordPad accessories as well as Microsoft Office apps ) turn to that folder the first time you choose File- Open or File-Save As . In addition , choosing Start . Documents-My Documents opens a window for the My Documents folder . Keeping your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and good , but why should you keep them where Microsoft dictates ?

If you previously stored some files in the My Documents folder , you can move them and delete the original My Documents folder .

If you have View-as Web page checked , you may be treated to a scary warning screen like the one in FIGURE 3 . If you enlarge the window , you may be able to see some of the folder 's contents , but since the window lacks scroll bars , you wo n't get very far . What to do ? Photograph FIGURE 1 : Photograph FIGURE 2 : // You get stuck with this undesirable view because the Windows you 're using to look at Win 98 does n't know Nowhere to find a certain file ( Webview.css ) . Fortunately , the fix is pretty easy . Just select View-as Web Page , and uncheck that option . For a more permanent fix , replace Folder.htt-the Web view settings file in the Windows 98 PC 's Program Files folder-with another settings file that does n't care about Webview.css @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Program File 's Folder.htt file to tell it Webview.css 's new location . First , the simple method , which disables the warning . Start by choosing View-Folder Options in Windows Explorer or in any folder window . Click the View tab .

Copy it to that system 's Program Files folder . The next time you access that folder from a networked PC running Windows 95 or NT using IE 4 , you 'll get a plain-Jane Web view-with scroll bars and no warning . On the other hand , if you 'd rather strengthen the warning-and hide all files until you click Showfiles ( as normally happens when you view the Windows and System folders in Windows 98 ) - copy Folder.htt from the Windows 98 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its Program Files folder . Of course , replacing the default Folder.htt in Program Files will affect everyone 's view of that folder . If that 's a problem , follow these steps : First , make sure all files show as before .

Next , with the Windows 98 PC 's Program Files folder showing on your PC , choose View-Customize this Folder . Click Next twice to open the folder 's Folder.htt in Notepad . Find the line beginning with ' ' &lt;link rel= ' ( it 's near the top of the file ) . In that line , delete ' ' %TEMPLATE DIR% ' ' ; when you 're finished , the line will read ' ' &lt;link rel=stylesheet href= " webview.css " title= " Windows " &gt; ' ' . Choose File- Save and then File- Exit . In the " Customize this Folder " wizard , click Finish .

I RECENTLY INSTALLED Internet Explorer 5 , but Active Desktop either has n't been installed or is n't working properly . Can you give me any advice on how to make it appear ? Clifford Collings , via the Internet AS YOU KNow , Active Desktop is the part of Windows 98 's or Internet Explorer 's Desktop Update feature that lets you view content from Web sites on the desktop and employ common Web file formats as wallpaper . However , users did n't like the idea of " push " technology , whereby information is sent to the desktop at the whim of the Web site owner instead of being specifically " pulled " in ( sought and chosen ) by the user . And as a Microsoft publicist told me , users did n't want a Web browser that overhauled their Windows interface . Consequently , Internet Explorer 5 ( and presumably its successors ) will focus more on Web browsing and less on modifying Windows . But do n't despair .
