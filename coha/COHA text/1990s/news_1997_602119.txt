<p> WASHINGTON  --  A California woman who could n't get health insurance for years finally learned why . Her medical records incorrectly stated she has Alzheimer 's disease . <p> A Kentucky man saw a psychiatrist for depression . After the doctor 's secretary quit , the man 's records mysteriously found their way to his employer , which happened to be the FBI . He was ordered to undergo psychological testing . <p> Stories like these are being repeated every day across the country , sparking a growing concern over the privacy and accuracy of medical and health insurance records . It 's become a major consumer rights issue and is about to become a hot political issue , too . <p> The Clinton adminstration today releases recommendations for the first federal law to protect the confidentiality of medical records . Debate will begin in Congress this fall . <p> For decades , access to medical records was limited mostly to doctors , some hospital personnel and a few insurance company workers . But in the far more complex and increasingly computerized world of health care today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimate details of a person 's health history and ailments has exploded . <p> An array of employees in most hospitals and insurance companies , for example , now have access to computerized records . And the records often find their way to the growing phalanx of administrators and researchers , both inside and outside those facilities , who monitor health trends and costs . <p> Managed-care plans such as HMOs use the records routinely to check the care enrollees are getting and identify ways to prevent illness and disease . They also exchange the information with firms hired specifically to review treatment plans . <p> Human resources employees at companies , and sometimes supervisors themselves , can get workers ' medical and insurance records . In one survey of 84 Fortune 500 companies , one-third of human resource employees said they had used such records in hiring , promotion or firing decisions . <p> Pharmacists and the companies that now coordinate benefits for employers keep extensive records on what drugs consumers take and often use the information to target marketing campaigns to doctors and patients . <p> And in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , legislators have given law enforcement officials virtually unfettered access to medical records to investigate insurance fraud and abuse . <p> " The way we protect the privacy of medical records right now is erratic at best , dangerous at worst , " Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said in a speech last July . " It 's time to do something about that . " <p> Shalala will appear before a Senate committee today to urge passage of a new federal law that would : <p>  --  Prohibit the use of personal medical information for any non-health care purpose other than to uncover insurance fraud or other criminal activity . <p>  --  Bar employers from using records for any non-health care purposes , such as in deciding on promotions or firings . <p>  --  Require computerized medical information to be secure . <p>  --  Impose criminal penalties for those who misuse or leak medical information . <p>  --  Allow consumers much easier access to their medical records and a simpler way to propose corrections in those records . <p>  --  Compel health professionals and facilities to tell patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who they share them with . <p> Congress , under a measure passed last year , has until August 1999 to enact a comprehensive medical privacy law . But many observers expect a big push over the next six months to a year to get a law in place . <p> " The president is very interested in seeing federal legislation on this move forward quickly , " says Chris Jennings , Clinton 's health policy adviser . <p> A patchwork of state laws provides some protections now . In most , it 's illegal to release medical records or the information in them to someone who has no legitimate need for the information . Doctors and hospitals usually seek patients ' consent to transfer medical records or release information . And people can obtain their medical records and request changes . <p> But consumers have limited rights to correct errors on their records or remove them from computerized databases or computer networks . And technically , doctors , hospitals , insurers , managed care plans and employers have " custody " of medical records . <p> The administration is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards than those in a federal law if they want . But most experts agree that a federal law should set broad and strong standards . <p> Crafting a federal law will be tough , though . Even before the administration 's recommendations had been delivered , consumer activists lashed out at an expected proposal that would continue to permit law enforcement officials to get medical records without a warrant or court order . <p> The FBI and other investigators have such authority now . Consumer groups lobbied the administration hard to impose more restrictions and specifically to bar officials from being able to use information gained in pursuit of insurance fraud against consumers . For example , if the police have obtained a record showing a person had used drugs , they could use the information to prosecute the person . <p> " The exception for law enforcement is too sweeping , " says Jan Goldman , a privacy expert at the Georgetown University Law Center in Washington , D.C. " It leaves consumers exposed to intrusive police work , not to mention that it broadens the number of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debate also focuses on just how much control consumers should have over their own medical records . Privacy rights groups believe control should be greatly expanded . <p> " Consumers need to have the right to alter their medical records and remove them from computer networks if they want , " says Denise Nagel , executive director of the National Coalition for Patient Rights in Lexington , Mass . <p> But insurance and business groups argue that medical and insurance records are now a vital part of the information needed for research , tracking disease outbreaks and health trends and improving the quality of health care . <p> For instance , the nationwide recall last month of bacteria-tainted hamburger meat was triggered after a public health official in Pueblo , Colo. , scrutinized a routine report on an infected patient at a hospital . Most of the time , patients ' names are attached to these records . <p> " Yes , we need to protect confidentiality , but medical care is improved when health professionals share information . . . . It 's not just your family doctor anymore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leadership Council , a group of 52 health care companies . <p> No privacy <p> Jackie Wooley of Redding , Calif. , says her experience shows such shared information can go too far and cause serious problems if the information is n't correct . Wooley , 39 , has a serious heart problem and takes numerous medicines , including some painkillers . Last May during a routine office visit , her doctor accused her of forging prescriptions . He 'd been mailed a list of drugs Wooley was taking . <p> The list came from a company that coordinates prescriptions for her insurer . Wooley says she was n't taking several of the medicines named , but the company suspected she might be abusing drugs and sent the list to her doctor . She believes other doctors she had seen in the past also got mailed the wrong information . <p> " It caused real problems and a lot of psychological pain , " Wooley says . " I was outraged that this company could gather and send this information out like that . " <p> Mental health professionals and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many therapists are even urging their clients to pay for sessions " off the books " and not file claims so insurers , HMOs and employers wo n't know about it . <p> Janet Pipal , a therapist in Fort Collins , Colo. , says she tells clients that if they want their sessions to stay private , " do n't seek insurance reimbursement . " <p> " There is no privacy any more with insurance payments , " she says flatly . <p> Ben and Wanda Walker of Louisville can attest to that . Ben Walker had been an FBI agent for 31 years when he began feeling depressed in 1994 . He started seeing a psychiatrist and taking an anti-depressant . He told his immediate supervisors about his treatment . <p> But last year , after his psychiatrist 's secretary quit , state authorities looking into possible billing fraud obtained copies of records from the office . The records later found their way to FBI officials . For reasons the Walkers have still been unable to piece together , he was reassigned and ordered to undergo testing . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walker says . " He thought what he said was private . " The Walkers and Ben 's psychiatrist are suing the state officials who released the records to the FBI . <p> Many doctors and therapists think a federal law is necessary but wo n't solve the problem . <p> " If thousands of health workers still have access to medical records , information will leak out , " says Nagel . " Everything I 've heard about what the administration is going to propose leads me to believe they are mostly interested in keeping medical records widely available . That 's a mistake . " <p> Who can see your medical , drug records <p>  --  Administrators at your HMO or health plan . <p>  --  Staffers in your doctor 's office . <p>  --  Hospital employees with access to the hospital 's computer systems . <p>  --  Insurance company claims processors . <p>  --  Your employer 's human resources employees . <p>  --  Your employer , if the firm sets up its own health- benefit plan . <p>  --  Employees at firms hired by your employer to process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan or employer to review claims and monitor health-care use . <p>  --  Workers in firms hired by your employer or health plan to manage mental-health benefits and presciption-drug benefits . <p>  --  Pharmacists ( prescription drug records ) . <p>  --  Companies , such as the Medical Information Bureau in Westwood , Mass. , that collect health-care information when you fill out applications for life or health insurance . <p>  --  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other agencies with access to physician , hospital and insurance records for public-health purposes . <p> CORRECTION-DATE : September 12 , 1997 , Friday <p> CORRECTION : A comment in USA TODAY Thursday from Denise Nagel , executive director of the National Coalition for Patient Rights , should have said : " Consumers need to have the right to amend incorrect medical records and have their permission asked before their medical information is entered into a databank.
