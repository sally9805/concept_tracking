<p> On a warm August night in 1983 , Bobby Griffith , then 20 , walked through downtown Portland , Ore. , and headed to the Everett Street overpass , which spans Interstate 405 , the main north-south artery cutting through downtown . <p> And then he waited . It was just past midnight . <p> Soon a tractor-trailer roared toward him on the freeway below and , with perfect timing , he jumped the 25 feet into its path . The impact ripped away most of his clothes . He was killed instantly . <p> Bobby Griffith was gay , something he was never able to fully accept . His name would have been just another on the long list of gay-related suicides , except for his mother . His death changed her life - and attitudes - forever . <p> Mary Griffith was a devout Christian when her son jumped to his death . Not only did she not accept his homosexuality , she set out to change it . Her faith would rid him of what she called " the most despicable evil of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathroom mirror . Left notes for him on the kitchen table . Preached to him daily that if he prayed , and if he believed , he could change . <p> But it was not to be . <p> " The religious right , and that kind of mentality , is set in cement , " she says today . " It 's pretty deadly , if I can use that expression . " <p> Mary Griffith 's journey from conservative churchgoer to parade-marching activist is the subject of a new book , Prayers for Bobby : A Mother 's Coming to Terms With the Suicide of Her Gay Son , by Leroy Aarons ( HarperSanFrancisco , $ 20 ) . <p> Aarons , who spent three years reading Bobby 's journals and researching the book with the Griffith family , believes the story is " a victory of the human spirit that transcended tragedy . " <p> But it has been a wrenching journey for Mary Griffith , who not only lost her son , but also her church : " I now believe that any creed or ideology that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abusive to our youth - gay or straight . " <p> Griffith now hosts meetings of PFLAG ( Parents , Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays ) , and almost daily counsels parents of gay children who call her for advice . Every June , when the gay pride parade heads down Market Street in San Francisco , Mary Griffith is there , wearing a photo button of Bobby . <p> Suicide ranks third as the cause of death for 15- to 24-year-olds , behind accidents and homicides . <p> If that statistic is n't bad enough , the suicide rate for gay youth is estimated to be two to three times higher than that of straight youth . <p> Lisa Rogers , executive director of Out Youth Austin ( Texas ) , is trying to keep that number from rising . She , with the help of 100 volunteers , runs the 3-year-old drop-in center for gay youth . It is named for Bobby Griffith . <p> " What so many of these kids like Bobby grow up hearing is that not only gay people do n't deserve to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that so many gays and lesbians beat themselves up , " Rogers says . " It 's an insidious homophobia . If someone else does n't gay bash us , we 'll gay bash ourselves . " <p> The Bobby Griffith Center runs a daily nationwide toll-free help line for gay youth , open 5 : 30 p.m. -9 : 30 p.m . CT daily . Each month , more than 2,000 youths call 800-969-6884 reaching out for help . <p> " They find out that they 're not alone , " Rogers says . " That 's the powerful thing of it . It 's a lifeline for these kids . " <p> Mel White , author of last year 's Stranger at the Gate ( Simon &; Schuster , $ 23 ) , is now a gay activist but used to be the ghostwriter for televangelist Pat Robertson : <p> " The hostile climate in which we 're being beaten up , and we 're beating ourselves up , too , is often from this inflammatory rhetoric from the religious right , " White believes , citing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creates the environment for the hate crimes against us , which also includes the hate crimes we commit against ourselves . Just as Bobby did . " <p> Anthony D'Augelli , professor of human development at Penn State University , has studied gay youth for 10 years , and admits the reasons for suicide among gay teens is a heated debate . While some say it 's social stress and homophobia , others attribute it simply to chronic anxiety or depression . <p> D'Augelli studied 200 gay youth in the early ' 90s , and found only 40% said they had never thought about killing themselves . Forty-two percent had even made a suicide attempt . ( By comparison , high school suicide attempt rates vary from 6% to 13% , according to D'Augelli . ) <p> " I see the most despair in kids from families who are deeply religious , " D'Augelli says . " There 's a profound sense of hopelessness . The child is in a terrible dilemma , where the family 's religion says they 're unacceptable to the families they love . <p> " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students who are gay or lesbian , but they 're just the tip of the iceberg , " D'Augelli says . " But it 's what happens to the tip of the iceberg - the abuse and discrimination - that keeps all the others hidden . " <p> While suicide is the ultimate tragedy , Sandra Gillis , executive director of PFLAG in Washington , D.C. , says the " on-going homophobic assaults against a gay teen-ager , as they struggle through the high school years , has an equally devastating effect on the whole family . . . . Kids have to lie to everybody , just to be safe , and even then they might not be . " <p> Gillis says the 326 PFLAG chapters nationwide serve as safe havens for gay youth with no other place to turn . <p> Gillis tells the story of an " all-American Eagle Scout " in Utah who recently contacted PFLAG headquarters by computer . He was gay , from a Mormon family , and desperate . <p> " So we put him in touch with a PFLAG chapter in Salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could talk to . " <p> " In every hamlet across this country there are desperate kids reaching out at any life preserver that is out there for them , " Aarons says . " But it 's a mixed picture . We again have the assault from the radical Christian right on any effort to educate gay and straight youth in our schools ( about sexual issues ) . " <p> Griffith routinely visits Bay Area schools - some still do n't welcome her - to tell Bobby 's story , and in recent years set up a scholarship in her son 's name , " to communicate love and support to the invisible student , the neglected school population . " The recipient does n't have to be gay or lesbian . <p> She thinks Bobby would be happy , " and more than a little surprised " at who she is today . <p> " I remember him saying to me that I just would n't bend . And I was so much into the Bible at the time that I had to stick to that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mother ca n't disregard everything else and stick with her child . . . just love him . It 's a message I try to teach daily now . "
