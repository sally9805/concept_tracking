<p> Let 's not pretend that the current school year has been " saved " by a judge or Board of Education-School Finance Authority-state Legislature-Chicago Teachers Union compromise . This school year has been a disaster for every Chicago public school student . <p> During these first weeks of school , children have witnessed the elimination of band , dance , music and theater classes . They have been subjected to the continual threat of an educational shutdown . They have seen their class schedules regularly reshuffled as teachers from all disciplines lose their positions . <p> Regardless of the outcome of the negotiations , the patchwork education students receive is just one more indication that society does n't respect its children . This school year already has shortchanged every student in the system . Let 's not pretend no damage has been done . <p> Jay C.

" In fact , we believe baseball 's monopoly status is threatening " free " network baseball coverage and is allowing owners to lay the foundation for pay-per-view . <p> Baseball 's new TV agreement with ABC and NBC eliminates all national over-the-air telecasts prior to the All-Star break . And despite the addition of wild-card games , fans will get to see less of the playoffs than ever before . Only 19 out of a maximum of 41 playoff games will be broadcast to each region of the country . In Chicago , for example , fans will only be able to watch one of the two league championship series on TV next season , even though the city has both American League and National League fans . White Sox owner Eddie Einhorn has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay-per-view as a " public service . " <p> With the exemption lifted , the courts could force the American and National leagues to negotiate separate TV contracts , leading to far greater national network baseball coverage . Baseball 's exclusive broadcast territories also could be challenged , giving fans an opportunity to watch literally hundreds of baseball games not now available . <p> If Senators Paul Simon and Carol Moseley-Braun care as much about the interests of Illinois fans as they do the profits of owners , they 'll vote to make baseball play by the same pro-competition rules as all other businesses . <p> Adam Kolton , executive director , <p> Sports Fans Unlimited , New York <p> True Heroes <p> On Oct. 5 , I received the Paramedic Award of Valor after a sniper incident that took place earlier this year on 8200 S.

Our men and women deserve better . <p> When sent into battle , our military troops deserve the full support of their country . They deserve their own officers with full autonomy in the field . They deserve a clear statement of the reason for their being in battle , as approved by Congress . <p> The U.S. missions are numerous and ever-changing . Our military went to Somalia to end starvation . About 20 soldiers have paid with their lives under UN leadership , to say nothing of lives lost by the military of Pakistan and other countries . How many more have been wounded ? Now we are faced with the problem of rescuing soldiers who are prisoners . Bring all of our military home . Let the UN set up its own army of volunteers . No nation should sacrifice its youth on undefined missions . <p> Mary Ann Hester , Portage Park <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. military involvement in Somalia is the fact that our country is partly responsible for arming the men who are now shooting at U.S. and United Nations troops . <p> Since 1985 , the United States has been the top weapons supplier to Somalia . Now we are cleaning up the mess we helped create , at a cost in blood and money far higher than the short-term profits from the original sales . <p> Tragically , we have n't learned our lesson . The United States remains the top arms dealer to the Third World , controlling almost 60 percent of the market . Many of those weapons go to dictators or governments in unstable regions of the world . And Somalia is n't the first place U.S. troops have faced U.S. weapons  --  the same was true in Iraq and Panama . <p> To help stop the next Somalia , we have to stop the world 's arms dealers  --  beginning with the top gun . <p> Kevin Martin , executive director , <p> Illinois Peace Action <p> Do n't Borrow or Lend <p> If a borrower has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examiner peeking over his shoulder , then the truth is that the borrower simply did n't need the loan .

The first duty of government is to oversee and frugally manage the spending of hard-earned dollars coerced from the taxpayers . <p> J. E. Knowles , Barrington @x I LIVE IN NEW JERSEY , where if s cold for a good part of the year , and whenever the temperature drops to 32 degrees or below it becomes difficult to paint outdoors with watercolors . The water in the brushes quickly turns to ice , thereby cementing brush hairs to the plastic palette ; and the wet paint on the watercolor paper quickly crystallizes like a sugar glaze . Some artists might find the random , wild effects caused by freezing paint to be exciting , but I 'm interested in a more traditional , controlled approach to painting landscapes . I do n't like to work exclusively from photographs , and I 'm not satisfied spending the winter painting still lifes , portraits , or figure studies from live subjects in a studio . I 'm more excited by the landscape , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few hours sketching on location . I learn so much more working from life than from snapshots , and snow scenes are a perfect subject for the fluid , transparent medium of watercolor . There are few better ways to capture the brilliance of the white snow and the fluid blue and purple shadows . I could wait until midday and sit in the direct sun to paint , but the fighting conditions are at their least appealing , and the lack of strong shadow patterns renders the landscape completely boring . I searched how-to books and the internet for answers to this challenge , and I came across several recommendations to " mix a little vodka in the water . If that does n't work you can always drink it . " I also surveyed discussion boards on the internet where artists suggested using salt to lower the freezing point of the water , but that did n't work either . Putting the watercolor paper in direct sunlight to keep the surface warm only caused a glare on the painting surface that gave me a false reading of the relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy at the ski slope was inefficient and expensive . I even tried sitting in my automobile with the painting surface propped up against the steering wheel or the dashboard , but I could n't work in such cramped quarters . I received advice from two family members , one a mechanical engineer and the other a high-school physics teacher . Both love a challenge , and one came up with a recommendation that included heating a Teflon plate with a blowtorch ; and the other suggested using a car battery to heat a series of coils underneath a sheet of paper . Both plans seemed dangerous and cumbersome . My brother , the science teacher , insisted that the solution should involve hot water because it is readily available and releases heat slowly . I only needed to raise the temperature a few degrees to achieve the desired result . He suggested using a hot-water bottle , but its surface area was too small , and the bottle did n't conduct heat evenly . Nevertheless , his idea had potential , but I had to find a way of using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using a series of copper tubes filled with hot water like a radiator , but the tubes heated the paper unevenly and would only remain warm for a short period of time . After years of conducting this search for a way to paint outdoors in my beloved medium , I finally found a simple , lightweight , portable device I could make with just a few recycled materials . The idea occurred to me when I was about to discard the Styrofoam box in which some mail-order steaks were delivered . I cut down the sides of the box so there was a 1-inch lip that would contain heated water , and I attached a thin piece of sheet metal with silicone so the metal completely covered the top of the Styrofoam . I then drilled a hole into one side of the Styrofoam and inserted the screw top cut from a 2-litre plastic soda bottle and glued it with the same silicone adhesive . That would allow me to pour hot water into the sealed box and drain it when the water got cold . Once all the silicone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could tape a 10 ' ' - x- 14 ' ' or 12 ' ' - x- 16 ' ' sheet of 300-lb cold-pressed watercolor paper . Just before heading out to paint , I poured hot water through the bottle top , replaced the cap , and went outside with the assurance that my paper would remain warm long enough for me to paint for two or three hours . I made a similar Styrofoam box to serve as a warming palette that would hold the 17 or 18 colors I normally have available when I 'm painting , except that instead of adhering a piece of sheet metal to the Styrofoam box I glued a 12 ' ' - x- 16 ' ' Tom Jones plastic palette to the rim of the Styrofoam . A John Pike Palette would probably have worked just as well because it too is made with heavy plastic , but a lot of the other palettes on the market would have been too thin and flimsy to work well once adhered to the Styrofoam . Much to my surprise , I found that too much hot water in the chamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dry too quickly ; similarly , allowing the water in the chamber under the paper to get too hot would make it difficult to keep colors wet long enough to paint uniform washes . I reduced the amount of hot water when the outdoor temperature was fairly moderate and increased it when the weather was bitter cold . The reduced amount of water made both the palette and painting warmers lighter to carry , and it could be supplemented with hot water from a thermos if I wanted to keep working after the water in the boxes cooled off . Now my painting time is only limited by the fact that my right hand gets cold after a couple of hours because I do n't wear a glove on the hand in which I hold my brush . My fingers get intolerably cold long before the water inside the warming boxes loses all its heat . After two or three hours of painting in frigid conditions , I am ready to get back in my car and head home . I consider the watercolors done on location to be sketches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detailed then the paintings I exhibit in galleries and juried shows . For example , after a recent painting trip to Canada I decided to leave all the sketches untouched after bringing them home because I liked the freshness , spontaneity , and gestured quality of the studies . Sometimes I continue working on the sketches to make them more polished , and I take photographs of the scenes so that I have a bit more information about the locations to add to the studio watercolors . How I paint on location When I start a winter scene , I paint the lightest areas , which more often than not indicate the piles of snow . I lay in a wash of warm color ( cadmium orange with a little cadmium red light ) over the entire sheet of paper ; then I anticipate where the lightest cool , blue top planes will occur and introduce those colors into the wet wash . At the right moment , when the shine on the paper disappears and the paper is still moist , I use cobalt blue to generate a few of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let the paper become almost completely dry before painting the cast shadows that are closest to the objects causing the shadow patterns . I lay in the sky wash , and after it dries I begin to mass in the trees . I make a grayish-red color for the trees from a combination of cadmium scarlet with a little ivory black ; or I work with a mixture of cerulean blue , cadmium orange , and cadmium scarlet . The later mixture will granulate and yield a more textured look to the trees . Once all the trees are established and the wash has dried , I generate the shadows on the trees using a Payne 's gray mixture of cobalt blue with a small amount of the local color , and I apply that color throughout the shadows . That combination will establish the reflected plane within the shadow if it is applied correctly . Finally I add texture and the darkest accents where they are needed . I teach these techniques to adults and teenagers in my classes at the Ridgewood Art Institute , in Ridgewood , New Jersey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and although I show people how the techniques can be used outdoors in the winter , very few of my students are hardy enough to join me on location . Most of them say they 'll wait for the spring when they can paint outside without using my warming palette and painting surface .
