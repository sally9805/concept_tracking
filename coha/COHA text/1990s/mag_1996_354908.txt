On the eve of the Jewish Sabbath last Friday , Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres felt the moment was right for a glass of Yardin champagne . Israelis consider this their finest drink , and Peres was convinced that nothing but the best would do , given what was about to occur . Earlier in the week , he had seen his peacemaking stance with the Palestinians pay off when the P.L.O . changed its charter , removing passages that denied Israel 's right to exist . Now , the Prime Minister had a settlement to celebrate on a second front . He and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher were preparing to announce that Grapes of Wrath , the blitzkrieg with which Israel had pounded Lebanon for 16 days , would soon end . A cease-fire agreement had been achieved . " Warren , you did it , " Peres said , tilting his glass to the exhausted Christopher . The Israeli leader appeared almost euphoric , and also profoundly relieved . <P> Peres had good reason for both emotions , especially the relief . Since he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned against him ; but neither had it rallied to him as he established a new reputation as a tough leader . After bashing Lebanon with artillery , missile boats , F-16 jets and helicopter gunships , Israel had not achieved even one of its military objectives . Hizballah , the Iranian-backed militia that has been fighting Israel in Lebanon since 1982 , was still sending Katyusha rockets into the Galilee . And despite extensive damage to Lebanon 's infrastructure and the death of some 160 civilians , support for the guerrillas was growing in Lebanon . With general elections just four weeks away , Peres ' polls have slipped slightly  --  he now leads his rival , the Likud 's Benjamin Netanyahu , 49% to 44% . <P> Peres needed to find an exit from Lebanon before stalemate became disaster , and he was looking to the Americans to provide it . The U.S. recognized that Grapes of Wrath seemed out of proportion to the attacks that provoked it ; though Hizballah had fired missiles at civilians in the preceding weeks , they killed no one . Yet even when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheltered Lebanese refugees , killing 109 people , Clinton and his aides refused to condemn Israel . To Clinton , Peres is the keystone for Israel 's effort to reconcile with its Arab neighbors . And as such , he merits backing . By providing support , the U.S. was endangering its relations with the entire Arab world , but the White House seemed to feel it had no other choice . <P> Thus on Saturday , April 20 , Secretary of State Warren Christopher landed in Jerusalem . His objective was to put a stop to the killing immediately , and then lash together a new , written version of the 1993 ground rules governing the low-level war the Israeli army and Hizballah are waging in and around the " security zone " that Israel occupies in south Lebanon .
