Best-laid plans may go agley , but how bad that is depends on who you ask . . . . Photograph <p> SYNOPSIS For Evesham Giyt life in the low rent district of Wichita , Kansas was easy Because he was good , maybe the best in the world-at teasing into any computer datafiles whatever data he wanted them to hold-he had plenty of money , no re sponsibilities , and plenty of time to indulge his personal interests , of which he basically had two . One was daydreaming about famous conquistadors of the past , whose lives were so much more exciting than his own . The other was his lover Rina The fact that Rina had once been a prostitute did n't bother htm ; she had retired from that line of work long since and was currently taking business-management courses at the local campus of the University of Kansas The only thing that really bothered Giyt was that Earth was fully explored . It had no new lands left for a person like Giyt to conquer-even if be had been actually willing to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved a lot of killing . The last thing Evesham Giyt ever wanted was to kill anybody . What changed Giyt 's life was that he met a recruiter for the planet Tupelo . Tupelo was by all means the nicest planet Earth 's astronomers or interstellar probes had ever discovered . It had Earth-Iike air , climate , and gravity . Maybe ft was a little short on land area-the planet was basically all ocean , apart from one fairly puny continental landmass at its pole and a scattering of islandsbut , taken all in all , it was eminently suitable for colonization . It did have one minor drawback , Five separate species of extraterrestrial aliens were colonizing it already . However , that was n't a big problem . The aliens were willing enough to let Earth humans immigrate as well . What was more , the ExtraEarth Foundation-Ex-Earth for short-was prepared to subsidize any would-be colonists . Getting to the planet was no problem , either . You stepped in one door and stepped out another , thanks to the amazing Sommermen FIZ transport system . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at once and , with Rina by his side , took the plunge . The planet Tupelo turned out to be just about as attractive as the recruiter had promised Rina quickly made friends with their next-door neighbors , the same-sex couple of Mrs and Mrs. de Mir and their brood of children , while Giyt 's computer skills fit right in with the needs of the little Earth colony . When he had reworked the budget systems so they could function efficiently , Ex-Earth 's local representative , Hoak Hagbarth , took Giyt aside and made a suggestion . The current Earth mayor was retiring . They needed a new one . Why not the man who knew how to run the system ? And when an election was held , to Giyt 's astonishment , he won by a landslide . Hediscovered that one reason no one had specially wanted to compete for the job was that its duties were mostly ceremonial , but it did have one obligation . The Earth mayor , along with his opposite numbers from the five alien species , was required to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The aliens were a bit of a shock to Giyt and his wife . They came from five planets of four different stars , and not one of them looked at all human . There were the Delts , so-called partly because their planet 's star was Delta Pavonis , partly because of their triangular heads with their independently wandering eyes ; the Delts were the race charged with providing the community with electrical power from their fusion plant on a nearby island , and their company was n't particularly pleasant because they smelled bad . There were the PettyPrimes , tiny hairless bipeds about the shape and size of marmosets ; they were the easiest of the aliens to get along with , and Rina was enchanted with their friendly , kitten-sized young . The Kalkaboos were more or less primate in architecture but with glittery , solar-paneled skins , and the only thing Giyt and Rina found to object to in them at first was their every-morning religious ritual of setting off huge firecrackers at sunrise to blow away the previous day 's sins . Finally there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Slugs looked more or less like large , furry-skinned amoebae , extruding eyes and members as necessary ; they liked a damp climate , so they occupied a village of their own down in some sludgy , river-bottom land , outside of the community where all the other races lived . The Centaurians looked , more than anything else , like curly-haired anteaters . What struck Giyt and Rina as most curious about them was that , although the female Centaurians were roughly the size of sheep , their males were not much bigger than mice and spent most of their time clambering around the fur of their mates . It was those two , the Slugs and the Centaurians , who had first settled the planet Tupelo , after fighting a devastating interplanetary war against each other a little earlier . When they met on the new planet they had learned their lesson . They signed a treaty of perpetual peace on what they called the " Peace Planet , " and as new races arrived they were required to sign it as well . The meetings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of little earplug translators , so that at least the various races did n't have to learn each other 's forbidding languages . What made them complicated was that , in spite of the name of the planet , the meetings were seldom all that peaceful . The Delt High Champion ( as the Delts called their leader ) was the first to make trouble for Giyt , but most of the members were equally determined to insist on the rights of their species over all oth ers . Only the Centaurian mayorequivalent , Mrs. Brownbenttalonher actual Centaurian title was " Divinely Elected Savior " - seemed truly pacific . There were one or two other annoyances connected with the mayoralty . For one , Giyt felt obliged to set an example by taking part in community activities , like joining the volunteer fire department . Worse was the fact that , although he had very little real power-most decisions were made by Hagbarth , on behalf of Ex-Earth-a good many citizens did n't seem to understand that , and so he was constantly besieged with complaints and requests for favors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but even that had its compensations ; Earth humans adapted to it by adding a four-hour siesta to their diurnal schedule , and Giyt and Rina found good uses for that . RIna , now a respectable matron , ventured to make contact with her estranged sister on Earth , who welcomed her back into the family . And Tupelo , after all , was full of interesting things for Giyt to do . Along with Amelia Patroosh , an expert from Earth , he visited the Delt powerplant on Energy Island and planned to take the suborbital rocket to the planet 's factory complex on the polar continent . But there were some puzzles . For one , there was a nagging question . if the FTL portal-toportal transport system was really the invention of the Earth scientist , Sommermen , , how did it happen that all the aliens had been using the same system long before an Earth human ever got there ? And-although the humans on Tupelo referred to themselves as the " Earth colony " - was n't it a bit strange that every one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Giyt 's relationship with Hagbarth began to deteriorate when the ExEarth manager asked him to try to slip a measure through the Joint Governance Commission that would allow Hagbarth to import some handguns-for protection against ferocious sea predators , " Hagbarth said . When Giyt tried to oblige he was shouted down by all the other members , because that was one of the things the Peace Treaty specifically forbade . And then he got in trouble with the Kalkaboos . It was n't Gt 's fault . As part of his duties as a volunteer fireman he was tending a booth at their fund-raising fair , the " Taste of Tupelo , " when the Kalkaboo High Champion became upset at something Giyt had done and died of a stroke . The Kalkaboos blamed Giyt for their leaders death and demanded he pay penance by blowing up an immense firecracker of his own . Moreover Kalkaboo customs required that the new High Champion vanquish his predecessor 's killer in a purely symbolic fight . But Giyt misunderstood and fought back , and so he was in worse trouble with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly to Giyt . She invited him to a party at her house , where she promised to help him with his Kalkaboo problem . It was important to clear that up , she said , because in a little while there was going to be a meeting of representatives from all six of the planets represented on Tupelo-not the Joint Governance Commission , but actual VIPs from the home planets-and there should be no local dissensions when that happened . She also told him that his suspicions were correct ; Sommerman did n't invent the FTL portal , it was developed by the aliens and they made a gift of it to Earth . Giyt wondered why Ex-Earth , and everyone connected with it , had lied . He wondered , too , about the financial structure of the colony on Tupelo , which seemed to be heavily subsidized by whatever shadowy figures were behind Ex-Earth for unclear reasons . When he asked Hagbarth about these things , the Ex-Earth man evaded the questions but tried to pump Giyt about everything Mrs. Brownbenttalon had told him . The aliens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth humans . He told Giyt it was his duty to his planet to wear a recording device next time he saw the Centaurian female , and to try to pump her about her planet 's military capabilities . Giyt refused indignantly , and Hagbarth warned him he would pay for it . For one thing , he had somehow found out about Rina 's past history on Earth as a prostitute , and tried to use it as blackmail . This was a blow below the belt . Rina was pregnant with Giyt 's child ; what had begun as a sexual convenience , and continued because ExEarth wanted only married couples to colonize Tupelo , had turned into a real love . Nevertheless , Giyt refused to spy on a friend , and harassment began . The first signs were staged complaints about Giyt 's misconduct as mayor , then the rumor about Rina 's past began to spread . And when they returned to their home after a visit to Mrs. Brownbenttalon they discovered their backyard pipes had been mysteriously dug up and their plumbing did n't work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , guys and guyinas , it 's me again , your Voice of Tupelo , Silva Cristl , with a weather report that 'll cheer you up . The bad news is that Hurricane Sam has intensified overnight ; now it 's Class Five , with winds over 300 kilometers an hour . The good news is that it 's going to miss us . We 'll get some rain out of it , sure , but we 'll miss the big winds . Speaking of big winds , did you hear there 's a movement to rename the hurricane ? People do n't want to call it Hurricane Sam any more . They want to call it Hurricane Evesham , because it 's a lot of hot air that misses the mark . - Lt Silva Cristl 's morning broadcast Giyt did n't want to talk to Hoak Hagbarth . Given a choice , he would have cut the man out of his life entirely , but the mess in his backyard left him little choice . Something had to be done . When he tried to call Hagbarth about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communicator ; when he called the Hagbarth house it was only Olse Hagbarth who was there . " You say they dug up your backyard ? Really ? Well , I did hear something or other about a complaint of stopped-up drains a while back , but I 'm afraid I was n't paying much attention . " When Giyt asked who had made the complaint she only shrugged . " I guess you 'd have to ask Hoak about that . Well , no , he is n't here right now . He 's in a major meeting-you know , getting ready for the six-planet congress-and I ca n't interrupt him . Anyway , the sewers are Slug business , you know . Why do n't you file a requisition ? Although they 're so backed up with the congress coming , heaven knows when they 'd be able to get around to it . " She was right about that . The Slugs were so busy getting ready for their VIPs to visit that there was n't a single Slug in the waterworks office . In fact , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when your luck was bad it was bad all the way-was a female Kalkaboo . When she saw Giyt coming she raced him to the door , but he got inside the office before she could lock him out . Sulkily , she retired to her desk . At first Giyt thought she was n't going to talk to him at all , but evidently her sense of duty overcame her revulsion . " Have no authority accept requisition , " she told the air , unwilling to look Giyt in the face . " Slugs all in Slugtown , performing extremely great group sing for safety of soon-arriving leaders . Go away . " " But it 's an emergency , " Giyt protested . " Yes , of course emergency , what difference ? This work you are complaining not done by Slugs anyway . No work order in file . No progress report . So not Slug , so Slugs probably not going fix anyway . You do n't like ? You ask head Slug about same at commission meeting of joint governance , see how much good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the waterworks office was n't quite a total loss . At least he had found out that the ruin in his backyard was n't part of some official maintenance program . Which left only one possibility : it was more of Hoak Hagbarth 's teaching Giyt a lesson . The ameliorating fact was that the lack of waste-water disposal was n't a desperate emergency . The de Mirs had offered them the use of their own facilities at any hour of the day or night . Then , when Giyt got back from the waterworks office , he inexpertly managed to hook up a hose drain to the kitchen sink . It took an hour of swearing and getting wet , but when he was finished Rina could at least cook , the waste spilling out onto what passed for their lawn . None of that helped to alleviate the smell from the backyard . Smoldering , Giyt snapped on the human-language broadcast to take his mind off Hagbarth 's malice . What was on was a delayed broadcast of an Earthly hockey game . He watched it unseeingly until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't forgotten you 've got a Commission meeting coming up ? " He had . What 's more , he had also completely forgotten about Mrs. Brownbenttalon 's promise to mend matters with the Kalkaboos . Mrs. Brownbenttalon had n't , though . By the time Giyt got more or less cleaned up from his exploits with the kitchen drain there was the Centaurian , leaning out of a cart before his door and calling to him . " What you do , " she instructed as soon as he was inside , " is totally prepared by me . You perform return bout with new High Champion , OK ? Nothing serious , you understand . No maiming . But element of paramount importance you must remember is you positively must not this time win . " She bobbed her long nose at him for emphasis . " No more discuss this , please . What is terrible smell ? " And when Giyt told her about his troubles with the Slug repair crews she sighed . " Slugs , " she said mournfully . " Who can do anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ask head Slug at commission meeting , maybe he in good mood . Usually not . Now we have conversation of trivial matters so you compose yourself . You like this fine weather we having now , temporarily ? " There were a dozen or more persons milling around outside the door of the Hexagon , humans and eeties mixed . Giyt eyed them warily , but there did not seem to be any Kalkaboos among them . As Giyt entered one of the men caught his arm . " Where the hell are we supposed to sit , Giyt ? " he demanded . Actually it was a fair question . Inside the building Delt and human crews were ripping out most of the seats usually supplied for the audience . New , and obviously a good deal more comfortable chair-equivalents were stacked along the wall , ready to be installed for the comfort of the delegations . Giyt gave the man a helpless shrug and entered cautiously . All the other members were already in their places , even the Kalkaboo High Champion , who did not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in general , " Sorrow for lateness . I and Earth human had business of non-public nature . Please begin . " And the Principal Slug-acting as chair for the day-slapped the desktop with one extruded member for order , commanded the work crews to stop their noisy activities , and began the meeting . It was not a peaceful one . It seemed that every member of the Commission had a complaint to make or a demand to register . The Principal Slug was first , usurping the privilege of the chair to point out that there were not enough damp-conditioned carts available in working order for the use of their delegation from the Slug home planet . Then the Petty-Primes " Responsible One protested that the traffic involved in preparing for the meeting was so heavy that their small carts were at risk of being run over in the streets , and then the Delts weighed in by announcing that the other members of the Commission were taking up time on frivolous matters when they should have ratified the seat assignments on the suborbital polar rocket and , really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish preparing the hall for the six-planet meeting . Even Mrs. Brownbenttalon indignantly proclaimed that all that work should have been completed long ago , because more staff members for the six-planet meeting would be arriving very soon , and the accommodations for the Centaurians were not ready . It did not take Giyt long to figure out what was motivating them all . The audience was much larger than usual , uncomfortably perched on whatever surfaces were left for them . Most of them were eeties-Giyt even saw the female Kalkaboo from the waterworks office-and among them were a number he had never seen before . Those newcomers , he realized , had to be advance staff members for the delegations from the home planets . What the mayors were doing was showing off for the high brass . Only the new Kalkaboo High Champion was silent . He did not speak , did not look at Giyt , hardly moved at all except for the flapping of his huge ears . The only time he paid any attention at all was when Giyt found an opening to bring up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kalkaboo conspicuously turned his back , while the Slug in the chair slobbered reprovingly , " This purely unofficial personal matter , Mayor Giyt . Not to come before this body never . No other proper business ? Good . Meeting I now adjourn . " Well , Giyt thought , he had n't really expected any more . Meanwhile , what about this other matter ? He started to ask Mrs. Brownbenttalon what had gone wrong with her arrangements with the Kalkaboos . That was when he found out that nothing had gone wrong at all . He had incautiously turned his back on the High Champion . Before Giyt knew what was happening , the Kalkaboo leaped off his platform and bore him to the ground . " Die in wretched agony , vicious murdering person ! " he shrieked , pounding Giyt 's head against the floor . But not really very hard , and not for more than a moment . Then the Kalkaboo rose and said politely , " Thank you . Vengeance is now complete . Expect you recover from this beating soon . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete , and it produced some unexpected dividends . The High Champion of the Kalkaboos did not become friendly , exactlyfriendliness did not seem to be among the behaviors in the Kalkaboo repertory-but he did something better . He beckoned to the female Kalkaboo from the Slug office and whispered into her great ear . She in turn spoke to the Principal Slug , who listened for a moment , then called to Giyt . " Am informed repair requisition of you on file , so work will be done . Is quite irregular . Slugs , however , always cooperate reliably , this our nature . " And then the next morning , as he was breakfasting with Rina at daybreak , they heard the pop of an explosion outside their own door . When they peered out they found it was pouring , but they caught a glimpse of a Kalkaboo running away in the rain . " I guess they did n't trust you to set off your own firecracker , Shammy , " Rina said . " Anyway , it 's all straightened out now , right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and returned to his pancakes , more cheerful than he had been in days . At least the problems with the extraterrestrials on Tupelo seemed to be healing themselves . The humans , however , were a different matter . The stresses there were not healing themselves . They were getting worse . XX The last species to reach Tupelo before the arrival of the Huntsville probe were the Petty-Primates . Once again , the identity of the solar system they come from has never been established . although it seems clear that , in the conditions that affect life , their planet was quite like Tupelo , and thus , no doubt , a good deal like Earth itself . Physically , the Petty-Primes are tiny . More than any other terrestrial creature they resemble tailless , hairless monkeys . Yet , with a brain less than a tenth the size of a human 's , they have demonstrated enough intelligence to develop a highly sophisticated technological culture . That is surprising in itself But the PettyPrimes have another quality that is still more unlikely . That is their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curve , plotting mass against longevity for mammalian species , and it demonstrates that the smaller the creature , in general the shorter its life expectancy . Not the Petty-Primes . They are completely off the curve . Their childhood extends for nearly thirty years so that by the time a Petty-Prime is sexually mature it has gone through decades of learning and experience . The length of their lives as adults is equally astonishing . When the first humans reached Tupelo some of the original Petty-Prime colonists were still alive and well , though since then most have either died or returned to their home planet . - Britannica on-line , " Tupelo " The more Evesham Giyt thought about it , the more he was convinced that the world would be a better place if Hoak Hagbarth were n't in it , either back on Earth or , preferably , dead . That was a conclusion that startled him . Giyt had never before in his life wished for any other person 's death . It was n't that he planned to do anything about it . He had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them had weapons to shoot each other out with . But to punch the man stupid , yes , that was a tempting option . Bash him bloody and then kick his ugly face in-yes , definitely that scenario had real attractions for Giyt .... Or would have had , if Rina had n't begged him to let the matter pass ; " All he did was tell the truth , Shammy , " she said , dry-eyed and somber . " The whole thing is my fault . " " Nothing about this is your fault ! " She gave him the pursed-lips look that meant , You 're entirely wrong and I 'm certainly right , but I do n't choose to debate it any further . All she said was , " Please , Shammy . I 'm asking you to let it go . For me . " Well , he could n't let it go . But he could n't go against the wishes of the mother of his unborn child , either . And while he was considering just what he could do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , " if we had to go back-well , what I mean is , if we wanted to go back-it would n't be all that bad , would it ? " It took a moment for Giyt to understand what she was saying . Then he was firm . " Not a chance . We 're not going to bring up our son in- " " Or daughter , " she said . " I have n't checked . " " Whichever . Anyway , we 're not going to raise our family in some damn slide-room in Buena Vista . " She looked at him consideringly . " It would n't have to be in Buena Vista , Shammy . I 've been thinking . My sister and her husband have a three-roomer . I 'm sure they 'd be glad to have us , just till we got settled- " " That , " he said , " is not going to happen . I give you my word , Rina . We 're going to bring up our kid right here on Tupelo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evesham Giyt did n't have a lot of experience in keeping promises , had n't been in the habit of giving any to anyone . This one , though , he was determined to keep . He was not going to allow Hoak Hagbarth to kick them off the planet of Tupelo . But then , when he had begun to search for these " regulations " that Hoak Hagbarth could invoke when he chose , it began to look as though that might present some problems . There was in fact an Ex-Earth statute that said any colonist could be deported for aggravated antisocial behavior . The language was opaquely legal , but when Giyt read it over he saw that it could have been that sort of charge that had terminated Shura Kenk 's residence . Could have , at least if she was guilty after all , of whatever the de Mirs chose to believe . What was less clear was whether it could be used against Rina . Could it , for instance , be made retroactive to cover acts committed light-years away and years in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't tell . " See , " Rina said when he complained to her , " you 're really smart about most things , hon , but that 's lawyer talk . People like us are n't supposed to understand it . You need somebody to tell you what it means . You need a lawyer . " " Well , do you suppose there are any lawyers here on Tupelo ? " he asked , studying her . She seemed subdued , naturally enough , but as far as Giyt could tell she had n't been crying . But then Rina was n't ever a cryer . " The way to find- " she began , and then paused as a message flashed on his screen . They both looked at it ; it told Giyt that the first official group of delegates for the six-planet conference was about to arrive , and his presence was required to greet them . Giyt groaned . Rina shook her head . " You 'd better go , " she said . " What I was about to say was that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to check the personnel files . You go change your clothes . I 'll do it for you . " It did n't take her long . While he was brushing his hair she came in and leaned on the doorway , watching him . " There is n't anybody who calls himself a lawyer , " she reported , " but I did a deeper search and I found two people who had a little legal experience , anyway . One worked as a paralegal , and the other dropped out of law school in her first year . " " Good work , " he said , to cheer her up . " Well , maybe so , " she conceded , " but I do n't think it helps us much . The paralegal 's Olse Hagbarth . And the other one is Silva Cristl . " When Giyt arrived at the square in front of the portal the rain had nearly stopped , which was a good thing , but there was something less good going on . He had expected to find at least a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VIPs . He did n't . There was no one there at all except for a pair of Delt workmen , tinkering with a cart at the edge of the square in spite of the continuing drizzle . When he asked them what was going on one of the Delts turned a single eye on him , the other still gazing at the exposed mechanisms of the cart . " You do n't hear ? " the Delt said . " New word recently coming . Slug bosses being delayed , do n't say how long . Maybe twenty minutes , maybe who knows ? " " Never say how long , " the other one put in . " Slugs , you know ? But maybe give us time to get this busted old junk pile juicy enough for delicate Slug persons before getting here , that assuming you let us go on with repairing task . " The delay was news to Giyt . He wondered whether the fact that he had n't received the amended message was more of Hagbarth 's petty harassment , or simple inefficiency . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kill . He considered going back home to wait . It did n't seem like a good idea . He might not be there long enough for any real purpose . He also might not get the word again in time to get back for the actual arrival , and why give Silva Cristl something new to gossip about on her broadcasts ? He moved away restlessly . He had a lot on his mind , but it did n't seem to want to concentrate on any one subject . As he wandered he was thinking about the turgid wording of the ExEarth regulations , and wondering whether the Slug workers had started to fix his drains yet , and noticing the fact that he was getting wet . Was the rain going to get harder again ? Giyt had had little experience of hurricanes . He had checked out the weather reports and understood that the hurricane itself had missed their islands by a couple hundred kilometers ; all they were getting was the arc of storms that spiraled around its trailing edge . He saw a few people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to assume the worst of the rain was over , at least .... Then he saw a pair of humans , and one of them was Hoak Hagbarth . They seemed to be discussing something Hagbarth was displaying to the other man on his portable . When they looked up Giyt looked away ; he did n't want to talk to Hagbarth . Evidently the feeling was mutual . Hagbarth gave him only a glance , then turned the other man with a hand on his shoulder and led him toward the portal . Giyt stared after them , trying to identify the other man-was it one of the people from the hypermarket ? Probably , he told himself , that was one more sign of his failings as mayor of the Earth community ; a good politician would know all his constituents by now . And Giyt admitted to himself that , whatever his other virtues , he was n't a very good politician . A whirring behind him made him turn to see a doll-sized Petty-Prime cart drawing up . The Responsible One leaned out . " Apologies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but you observe inadequate space in passenger side this my vehicle . " He seemed to be making a pleasantry , so Giyt tried one in response . " It 's my fault for having too much growth hormone in my system , " he said . The Petty-Prime gazed at him blankly for a moment , then exhaled in a soft , uncomprehending sigh . " Anyway , " he said , " express regret for potential for no longer sharing Joint Governance Commission duties , perhaps . " He waved a small paw and accelerated his cart away . Whatever he meant by that . Giyt really had to get at those translation programs one day soon , he told himself , and then remembered that maybe he would n't be present to have to worry about such things very much longer . Meanwhile , he had VIPs to greet . When he got back to the square the keepers of the security switches were lounging by their posts , Hagbarth included , and a large group of Slugs were hooting one of their mournful hymns nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poked her snout out of her cart and beckoned to him . " My husband here say to tell you congratulations on excellent fall you took for new Kalkaboo stinky High Champion , " she said . " I share sentiment . Extremely well done , I say ! " Thanks , " he said , nodding at the tiny male in his wife 's neck fur . " I hope I 'm not late . " " Be commoded , Large Male Giyt . Is last-minute decision of Slugs to arrive early , laster-minute to be somewhat later , typical Slug thing . " She paused to listen as her husband chittered in her ear . " Oh , yes , " she said . " Have sorrow that-no , waiting a bit now . Hear warning dingle . " The chime had sounded to announce the imminent arrival of the leaders . As Mrs. Brownbenttalon flopped out of her cart the waiting Slug delegation redoubled their hooting , the people at the security switches came to attention , and the golden glow began to surround the portal as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The chamber door opened . There was the pop of expelled air from inside , the glow cleared , and two large Slugs appeared , eye stalks waving . They were immediately surrounded by Tupelo 's own Slug delegation , escorted to the waiting damp-controlled carts and borne away . Giyt blinked after them . " That 's it ? " he asked . " That is the all of the it , " Mrs. Brownbenttalon confirmed . already getting back into the cart that had brought her . " No orations . No shaking of hands , no sniffing of noses , nothing like that . Only all us dignitaries required properly physically present here at time of Peace Treaty delegation arriving or will take offense . Is a Slug thing , " she added , looking around and lowering her voice . " Delts are even worse and , hey , you know all about Kalkaboos from own self 's experience already , right ? Esteemed Giyt wife possess wisdom creating associations only with Petty-Primes and Centaurians such as self . Presume for mer presently condoling . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Brownbenttalon poked his nose out of his wife 's neck fur and spoke confidentially into her ear . " Oh , is understood , " she said to Giyt . " You do n't know yet . Well , you hearing soon enough , Centaurians do n't like telling bad news . We hope for seeing you in more happy time . Good-bye . " On the way home Giyt reflected on yet another cryptic utterance . He could n't tell how much of the mystery was due to deficiencies in the translation programs , and how much to simple eetie weirdness ; but as the cart approached his house he got a hint of what Mrs. Brownbenttalon had been talking about . There were Petty-Prime kits playing happily in the mud of the de Mir yard with the younger de Mir children , and on the de Mir porch were their mother , with both of the de Mirs and his own wife , talking earnestly to each other while the children played . As Rina caught sight of Giyt she excused herself and came toward him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is n't that the wife of your farming friend ? " " Ex-wife , actually ; they change partners a lot , I understand . But they 're friendly , and he told her something she came hurrying over to tell me . It 's Hoak Hagbarth , Shammy . He 's circulating a recall petition for you . He does n't want you to be mayor any more . " XXI It 's official , all you misters and mizzes , they 're getting ready to jump ! Our official delegation to the Six Power meeting is getting final instructions from their governments , and they 'll be arriving here on Tupelo in three days . Let 's all be there to give them a good old Tupelo welcome ! Because , remember , these are n't Ex-Earth people , these are the official representatives of the old United Nations , and that means they 're speaking for the head honchos of the whole damn planet ! So we want to look our best for them . Too bad there 's one little piece of housekeeping that we probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I mean ! But there'II be plenty of time to take care of that later on . - Lt . Silva Cristl 's broadcast If there was one experience that Evesham Giyt definitely did not want to have as mayor , it was being fired . If his term of office had come to its scheduled end he could walk away happily . He might even be willing to peacefully resign ; in fact , that thought had crossed his mind more than once . But to be kicked out ? No , that was something else . It was unacceptable . It did n't take Giyt long to find out why they had n't seen the recall petition on the net . Someone had , not very expertly , cut the Giyts and the de Mirs out of the basic loop , so that all that came to their personal screens was a censored version of what went to the whole community . Once Giyt had an idea of what to look for he located it in less than half an hour , and created a detour around the block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was n't very specific . There was n't anything that actually said that Rina had once been a prostitute , or that accused Giyt himself of any serious misdeeds . But in and among all the whereases-presumably Olse Hagbarth 's work , or Lt. Cristl'sthere were a lot of words and phrases like " malfeasance " and " prejudicial conduct , " and what they all added up to was that the people who signed the petition were asking for a special election to be held to kick Evesham Giyt out of his job as mayor . Rina came in , and peered over his shoulder . " Lunch is ready , " she announced , counting the names . " Seventy-six signatures , " she said thoughtfully . " They need twenty-four more to make it count . " He turned to gaze at her . " How do you know that ? ' ? " I looked it up , of course . It 's what the regulations say , a recall petition must be signed by at least ten percent of the citizens , and that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I think they 're having trouble getting the hundred . There are a lot of people who like you . " But there were a lot who did n't , too . While he was eating his lunch Giyt studied the signatures on the hard copy , trying to fit a face to each name . More than half the members of the fire company had signed . So had , he estimated , a majority of the various people who had asked him for favors at one time or another and been turned down . So had the former mayor and her husband , and all those were easy enough , if not pleasant , to understand . But there were at least a dozen signatures that Giyt hardly recognized . Certainly he could not remember ever having done anything to offend them . When he said as much to Rina , sitting pensively across from him and nibbling a stalk of celery while he ate , she shrugged . " Hagbarth 's had plenty of time to hand out favors . I guess they owe him , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I suppose . " Then he looked at her more closely . " You 're not eating , " he accused . She shrugged again , and he remembered some of the things he 'd looked up about pregnancy . " Hey ! What is it , is it this morning sickness business ? " " It turns out it is n't just in the morning , " she admitted ruefully . " Now , Shammy , do n't get all worried about it . It 's just something that pregnant women do . I 'm going to go to the clinic this afternoon for a checkup anyway , and they 'll give me something for it . " " I 'm going with you , " he announced . " I- Wait a minute . " There was an action message coming in on his screen , it said that the Delt delegation would be arriving in ninety Tupelovian minutes . " Damn , " he said . " Well , I 'm going to go with you anyway . " " Oh , hon. That 's sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can handle it by myself ; you stay home and work until it 's time to meet the Delts . " But Giyt did n't stay home , he went right along with her , as much to be ready to glare down any citizen who chose to give his wife any dirty looks as because he thought she needed company . There was n't any of that . Business was slack at the little hospital building , and the couple of people sitting in the waiting room seemed more concerned with their own problems than with whatever was happening with the Giyts . The doctor on duty took Rina into the examination room without comment , except to firmly veto Giyt 's notion of coming with them , leaving Giyt with nothing to do but wait . The proper place for that was the waiting room , but Giyt was too restless for that . He roamed around the little building , pausing in front of the window that looked on the cribs for newborns . There was only one baby there , with a medic who looked faintly familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to see his own child in that place , perhaps exchanging with other new fathers the ritual cigars that nobody was ever going to smoke-if anybody was going to be friendly enough with Giyt for that sort of sociability . If , for that matter , they were still going to be on Tupelo when the baby got around to being born . The medic had finished what he was doing with his charge , saw Giyt outside , and came out to speak to him . " Remember me ? " he asked . " II was the one who helped you with the kid that was choking ? Anyway , I just wanted to tell you that I 'm on your side . So 's Cheryl here , " he added , nodding to the woman who had come out of the pharmacy across the hall . " So are most of us , " she said , shaking Giyt 's hand . " I do n't go much for politicians , but I can stand you a lot better than that damn Vardesehn woman . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't interfere . " So Giyt was in a much better mood when Rina came out of the examining room . " She gave me a patch , " she says , showing it . " She says that 'll control the nausea-and , listen , hon , you do n't have to come home with me . Go welcome the damn Delts . You 're a sweet man , but you worry too much . " But actually , he told himself on the way over to the portal , he could n't help worrying about her . Maybe " worrying " was n't exactly the right word . He was sensible enough to know that morning sickness was n't a life-threatening kind of thing . What was on his mind was that he wanted to protect her . Evesham Giyt , who had never concerned himself with covering any ass but his own , had now assumed total responsibility for the well-being of the woman he had married . It was n't a rational thing ; it was the old story of the caveman guarding his mate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hagbarth preparing to take his place at the switches he gave the man a belligerent look , but succeeded in not going over to him and punching him in the nose . Hagbarth looked startled and turned hastily away . Which gave Giyt some minor satisfaction . All the other mayors were there , with a large company of Delts waiting to greet their dignitaries . Giyt nodded to Mrs. Brownbenttalon , returned the gesture when the Petty-Prime Responsible One waved a paw at him , even got a greeting from the new Kalkaboo High Champion . One of the Delts broke ranks to come over to him ; Giyt recognized him as the pilot from their trip to Energy Island . " Hey , you Earth Person Giyt , " he said affably , both eyes on Giyt . " Greetings . Regrettings , too , because hear stinky Hagbarth person trying screw you . Pity . All us Delts think you not quite so bad . Comparing to other Earth persons , I mean . Sorry we ca n't vote , this matter none of our business , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , somewhat touched . " Anyway , " the Delt went on , one eye wandering toward the portal , where the golden glow was just beginning to develop , " what I wanted asking you , what do you think ? How long you guess it take them for bouncing you out ? Reason want to know , can then get bets down in the pool . " By the time Giyt got home again he felt reasonably sure that , if the recall vote included all the eeties on Tupelo , he would probably win in a landslide . It did n't , of course . But , all the same , it was a cheering thought , at a time when such thoughts were scarce . Rina greeted him at the door , looking flushed and pleased with herself . " I 've got something to show you , Shammy . Come in here a minute . " What she had to show him was her screen , which was displaying a freeze frame of eight or nine human beings , all looking either solemn or angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's deportation hearing , hon. It took a little hunting , but I found it . Only I do n't think it 's much use for what we want , because there are n't any lawyers there , either . " She touched a key and the picture began to move , Giyt gazing wonderingly at it . It was n't much of a trial , if that was what it was supposed to be . Not only were n't there any lawyers , there did n't seem to be any witnesses , either . Former Mayor Mariam Vardersehn was sitting in what appeared to be the chair , while Hoak Hagbarth was reading a list of accusations concerning Shura Kenk . Shura Kenk sat in a straight-back chair , listening but hardly speaking ; she was the one who looked dejected , and had reason enough . There did not seem to be a lot of justice being dispensed at this hearing . Even the complainant , the twelve-year-old Grayhorn boy , was n't present . When Hoak Hagbarth had finished , the half-dozen others in the room-Silva Cristl and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firehouse prominent among themwhispered among themselves for a moment or two . Then Cristl nodded to the mayor . " Looks like she 's probably guilty , Mariam , " she said , " and anyway what can we do ? The eeties would n't have any respect for us if we let somebody like that stay here . So she has to go . " That was it . All that was left was for Mayor Vardersehn to pronounce the sentence . " Since a jury of your peers has found you an undesirable presence on this planet , " she lectured , " you are hereby given forty-eight hours to collect-what ? " As Hagbarth was whispering to her . " Oh , sorry , I was thinking of something else . You 're given sixty-seven Earth hours , two Tupelo days that is , to collect your belongings and report to the portal for return to Earth . The session is concluded . " " What do you think , Shammy ? " Rina asked anxiously as the screen went black . He said , " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , but did you notice something else ? Do you remember what Lupe said , that Kenk claimed the real reason they were out to get her was something about the Pole ? " Puzzled , Giyt looked at her . " But she did n't say anything about the Pole . " " Right , hon. Like that old Sherlock Holmes story , you know ? Dr. Watson asks him what was interesting about the dog barking ? And Holmes says , why , just the fact that it did n't bark at all . Do you see what I mean ? Shura Kenk did n't mention the Pole at her hearing . " XXII The physical plant on Tupelo 's polar continent comprises fourteen main manufacturing domes scattered over nearly four hundred square kilometers . These are in general linked by covered passages , supplemented by robot ground-effect vehicles to transport materials back and forth . In addition to the main complex there are eleven additional sourcing sites . Those are mineral mines , where robot moles sniff through reefs of ore and extract it for processing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metals , then batch-processed into whatever alloys are required for scheduled production runs in the factories . In addition there are six relatively small oil and natural-gas wells , providing fuel for the polar continent 's dedicated powerplant as well as feedstock for its chemical factories . The autofactories themselves receive these raw materials and fabricate them into whatever is required for the use of the inhabitants of . Tupelo , or for export to their home planets . - Britannica on-line , " Tupelo " Shura Kenk not only had n't said anything about the Pole at her hearing , she had n't said anything at all . Nevertheless Giyt took his wife 's words seriously . He had decided long since that , although Rina 's reasoning was sometimes a little hard to follow , she was usually right . So he sat himself down to recheck everything there was in the databank about the polar factories . A lot of the information was in what Hoak Hagbarth had presumably thought to be secured files . That was n't much of a problem to Giyt . What was a problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ex-Earth 's business correspondence . A lot of the most potentially interesting material used code words for whatever it was talking about . What was even more of a problem was that he did n't know what he was looking for . At the end of two hours " digging he had found out more than he ever wanted to know about the products of the Earth factory at the Pole . In recent months the machines had turned out a bewildering variety of cookwares and clocks , underwear and utensils , dolls and toys in a dozen varieties , construction materials , personal hygiene products , bed linen , cutlery-all routine stuff , as far as Giyt could see . It all appeared to be properly accounted for , too . Bills of lading showed that the goods had gone into the robot subs that carried them to the island , and then either to the hypermarket or , as export goods , to the portal for shipment to Earth . Almost all the runs were small . That was n't surprising ; that was the special virtue of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six gross of carpenters " nails if you wanted them , and you could make them in a dozen different sizes . For that matter , you could make a single nail if you happened to want just one . You could make just about anything at all , as long as the manufacturing specifications were in the factory 's memory and the raw materials were at hand . And the specifications were . There was file after file of manufacturing protocols for endless lists of components for endless items-most of them incomprehensible to Giyt . What , for instance , was the purpose of one file , apparently unerased because forgotten , which contained a complete set of stats for eetie body odors ? That one Giyt could not figure out . Were the colonists perhaps planning to create a line of dolls to export to the eetie planets ? - because they were programmed to odor-respond only to eeties ? It seemed like a dumb idea to Giyt . If the Centaurians or the Kalkaboos wanted anything like that they were perfectly capable of manufacturing the things themselves . Orhe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone as resourceful as himself could n't figure out what they were doing with the data maybe its inclusion was quite smart . When he checked on what the factory was currently making he got another surprise . All the screen had to say on the subject was a legend : Cur rently under manual control . That did n't make any sense at all . Autofactories were n't ever run by manual control , except , maybe , in the brief periods when someone like Giyt 's father was teaching the machines how to assemble a particular device . Assuming the polar factory was that quaintly old-fashioned , which Giyt could n't really believe it was . Then he discovered another curious thing . Checking the production runs of the last month 's output he noticed that the factories seemed to have been idle for quite a lot of the time . That was , at the least , an inefficient use of facilities . If nothing else , the factory might as well have been churning out more clocks and toy airplanes to go back to Earth . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on end , more than once , though raw materials seemed to have continued to flow in . He leaned back , taking a sip from a cup of cold coffee , regarding the screen . Maybe Shura Kenk had been on to something . Was something odd really happening at the Pole ? And , whatever it was , who was doing it ? Hagbarth was the leading candidate , of course ; but what was the man up to ? Just for curiosity 's sake-and because he was stabbing into the files at random , anyway-he spent a quarter of an hour trying to find out what some of the eeties might be doing with their own factories at that moment . He chose the Petty-Primes , because he had already broken their basic protocols , but all he found out was that they were making 512 of one listed item and 4096 of another , but what those items actually were he had no idea . Still . . . The numbers made him think of those other cryptic inventory numbers he had observed long ago . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it he glumly regarded the lists of TARBABIES and GRABBAGS and RUTABAGAS and COPTS . They meant no more to him than they had the first time he saw them . But numbers were numbers , so Giyt did what he had done successfully so many times before . He set up a program to look for coincidences anywhere in the files of Ex-Earth , in the stats from the factories themselves , in the personnel files of Hagbarth and his wife-anagrams , birthdays , anniversaries-anything that might match the numbers . When fatigue finally drove him to lie down for a little rest he let the program run . He had trouble getting to sleep . He did n't seem to be getting anywhere . But he had no place else to go . When Rina woke him to tell him that his presence was requested to greet the incoming Kalkaboo delegation , she had two other items of news . The Slugs had finished repairing their drains , and now they could use their own toilet again . And Hagbarth 's petition seemed to have plateaued out : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with satisfaction . " He needs eleven more , and I do n't think he 's getting them . " It did n't take long to see that the Kalkaboos were officially greetedonly a small ceremony , with minimal fireworks-and then , almost immediately , the next delegation was due . They were the Petty-Primes . There were a lot of them-eighty or more , Giyt guessed , so that it took three portals-full to get them all to Tupelo . The Responsible One and his entire family were joyously bustling around , affectionately greeting every one of the scores of arrivals by name . It took forever . Mrs. Brownbenttalon seemed amused . The Delt General Manager and the Kalkaboo High Champion were stolidly patient and the Principal Slug , of course , was a Slug . It was only Giyt who fretted over the length of the proceedings ; and then , when all three batches of VIPs had arrived , the Responsible One had something else to keep everyone there . There was a meter-high platform , more like a picnic bench than a stage , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the delegation on it as a sort of receiving line . One by one , every non-Petty-Prime in the crowd was walked past . There was n't any hand-shaking , exactly-too much danger of crippling a tiny Petty-Prime paw in a huge human fist or sharp Centaurian claw . So they merely touched digits and exchanged greetings . It was the kind of meaningless event that Giyt would have done his best to avoid . He did n't want to hurt the Responsible One 's feelings , though . The little creature had been kind . Besides , exchanging a few meaningless courtesies took very little conscious thought . Giyt went right on thinking about the polar factories as he patiently plodded along the line . For a moment he considered taking the Responsible One aside-or Mrs. Brownbenttalon or one of the other mayors-and asking if they had heard anything , well , peculiar about human goings-on in the polar complex . But it might be an embarrassing question for them . Anyway , what could they know ? As he left the line he saw Hoak Hagbarth and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pair of Delts . That gave Giyt a new thought . The trouble with the Pole , with all its mines and autofactories , was that it was nearly nine thousand kilometers away . He thought of Hagbarth 's amiable offer , made back in those longago days when Hagbarth was still being amiable , to fly him up there on the suborbital rocket for a sightseeing trip . He wondered if he could find anything useful if he went there in person . Then he wondered if that offer was still open . Probably not . Besides , it would mean leaving Rina alone to face whatever nastinesses the Hagbarths might think up next . He nodded his farewells to the eeties he knew and went home , his mind still turning over all the questions and worries that did not seem to find any , solution . And when he sat down at his screen he found that at last he had been given a break . Something had turned up in the program he had left to run . When all the numbers had been crunched , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difference between the number of chiplets reported on hand at the beginning of the month and the number reported as used in the manufacture of all the items the factory produced that month . There was no doubt about it . Far more chiplets were being imported than ever went back into the dolls and gadgets the Earth human polar factory ever shipped out , and the numbers were not small . Someone was stealing . And that someone could only be Hoak Hagbarth . Giyt sat back , considering what to do next . If this had been one of the great corporations he had occasionally worked for on Earth , his job would have ended right at that point . All that would have been left for him to do was to turn the information over to the head of security . Chiplets were smaller than sequins , but they cost money . Big money ; some formerly trusted employee would soon be facing a spell in jail . The trouble was that it did n't add up . True , the fiscal systems for the human colony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was why Giyt had had to fix them , and ultimately why he became mayor . But what was Hagbarth going to do with a couple thousand stolen chiplets ? He could re-export them to Earth and sell them there , sure . They would be worth quite a lot . But that meant having confederates in the Ex-Earth organization on Earth . And anyway the sloppiness in the fiscal systems that let him cover up that theft could just as easily have been subverted in some simpler way-say , to divert credit balances to a dummy account like Giyt 's own . Rina came in , yawning , to bid him good night , and then got a good look at him . She came alert . " Shammy , what is it ? " " Minute , " he said , double-checking , just to make sure . The machines were surpassingly good at arithmetic , but you never knew .... He did know . There were no mistakes . " Look at this , " he commanded , and when Rina had taken in what was being displayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why , Shammy ? Why would he go to all that trouble when he could just steal the money the same way-well , you know what I mean . " " I do . I thought the same thing myself , but there it is . What I do n't know is what to do about it . " " Why , " she said , stooping to kiss him good night , " sure you do , hon. You 're the mayor . Mayors are supposed to uphold the law . So do it . " Do it . She was right . Apart from any personal satisfaction he might get out of it , Hoak Hagbarth was a criminal and he ought to be brought to justice . But brought to justice how ? That was a harder question . He could report the matter to Ex-Earth . But who would he be reporting to ? Almost certainly Hagbarth had confederates back there on Earth , probably in Ex-Earth itself , and was n't it likely they would be the ones to receive the report ? Perhaps he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what would they care about something that happened on Tupelo ? So he had some very valuable information , but who could he tell it to ? Just as he was puzzling over this another message appeared on his screen . The Earth delegates were arriving . There would be six of them , the notice informed him , and when he checked the names he saw that only one of them was an American . That , of course , was because this time it was the old United Nations , not Ex-Earth , who had supplied these ambassadors . But that one American was Dr. Emilia Patroosh , the woman who had gone with him to Energy Island ; and so Giyt had his answer to at least one question . He got to the portal just as its golden glow collapsed . Besides the obligatory eetie mayors , twenty or thirty Earth humans were waiting to greet them . Most of them , he saw with some surprise , seemed to come from the fire company , both Hagbarths among them . Olse glanced at Giyt as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the head . But she did n't speak , because both the Hagbanhs had more important things on their minds . As soon as the transmission was complete Hagbarth leaped down from his post in the control loop and advanced on the six Earth delegates , all smiles , hand outstretched to reach any other hand it could reach . He was n't the only one . A dozen of the other Earth humans , Olse included , were moving purposefully to greet the newcomers . The plenipotentiaries were an oddly assorted lot for Tupelo . One was a tall , mournful-looking woman with purple-black skin and a bright bandanna over her head-a Maasai from Kenya , according to what the roster had said . There was an elderly Swiss man and an even older Korean one ; one Egyptian , one New Zealander . . . and Dr. Patroosh . She was the one who counted . Giyt tried to push his way toward her .... And got nowhere . A large hand gripped his arm and a voice from behind said , " Want to do something useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the goddamn baggage . " It was Wili Tschopp , looking unfriendly . Giyt tried to pull his arm free , without success , as Tschopp was tugging him toward the stack of bags ard cases . " Let go , " Giyt said . " I want to talk to Dr. Patroosh . " " But she do n't want to talk to you , Giyt , " Tschopp said reasonably . " Look , she 's gone already . " And she just about was ; Hagbarth was deferentially helping her into one of the waiting carts and getting in beside her . Most of the other ambassadors were boarding carts as well , except for the tall Maasai woman , searching through the baggage for something of her own , pausing to look at them curiously . " What 's the trouble ? " she asked , her voice surprisingly deep . " Nothing , " Tschopp said , while Giyt simultaneously said : " I 'm the mayor here . I 've got something important to say to Dr. Patroosh . " " Oh , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , I 've heard of you . " " Then help me- " But she was shaking her head . " I do not think I can , " she said . " We 're here to represent our whole planet , Mr. Giyt ; we ca n't get involved in local disputes like this recall question . Dr. Patroosh should n't talk to you at all , and neither should I. " XXIII This is your overnight weather report . Farm areas west of the central massif will experience occasional showers , growing heavier by daybreak . East of the massif , upper lev els , possible showers and windy ; at town level , partly cloudy with a high of 24 deg ; near shore , warmer but dry . The polar station has a gO% probability of a major snow event , as the hurricane which narrowly missed the islands has moved north by northeast and appears to be joining a circumpolar low , possibly creating near-blizzard conditions - Tupelo weather service Evesham Giyt was n't in the habit of taking no for an answer , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted to ask . Although it was the middle of the night , as soon as he got home he tried calling Dr. Patroosh . She did n't answer , neither on her personal access code nor the one for the house she had been assigned . When the fourth or fifth call was n't answered he put his clothes back on , called for a cart , and had himself driven over to the house . It was as dark as all the others around it , both human and eetie , and no one responded to his knock . Frowning , Giyt went home again . There had to be a way to reach the Earth delegate , but what was it ? With Rina softly snuffling-you could n't call it snoring-in the next room , he sat down at the screen again . There was n't much for him there , either . When Giyt tried to access the polar manufacturing program again , he once again got the " manual control " legend . That was highly improbable . It was also what he had more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polar factories , and try as he would he could not find a way into the mystery . The answers were either on Earth or at the Pole itself . Going to Earth was n't an option , if only because his departure would be a victory for Hoak Hagbarth . Should he go to the Pole , then ? When he checked the schedules he found the suborbital rocket was on the island , due to return to the Pole the next day . He could bully his way onto it as mayor , he thought . But he wanted to know what was happening on Earth , too . It did n't take Evesham Giyt long to find an answer to that . He set about creating a super-scout , the most complicated of his career , to sniff through the entire net until it found just what Hagbarth and his gang were up to . It took time . It would take more time than that to produce any data that would be any use to him ; he encoded it to go to Earth in the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out what he wanted to know-if it did-it would have to wait for another transmission to report back to him . At least it was a tangible step . When weariness finally drove Giyt to bed he felt he had accomplished something . Dawn was lightening in the east when the din of Kalkaboo fireworks woke him . They seemed louder than usual ; some of them must be expiating particularly nasty sins , Giyt thought , maybe to impress the delegates from their home planet . By the time he was dressing after his shower the noise had stopped , the sun was well and truly up , and Rina stuck her head in their bedroom to remind him that there was a note on his screen . The Centaurians were arriving . Giyt had more or less got used to the arrival of these foreign dignitaries without quite knowing what was going to happen at any of them . Each was different . This time , although it was hardly more than dawn , what looked like every Centaurian on Tupelo was there before him . In the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mrs. Whitenose . There might have been others he knew , but he could n't pick them out in the mass of several hundred of the great females , with their smaller males and young romping around among them . When they saw Giyt they made way for him to join the other mayors in the front row , but he detoured as he caught sight of Hoak Hagbarth lurking by the portal . " Hagbarth ! " he called . " Wait a minute . " The Ex-Earth man had already hastily turned to take his place at the control switch , but he was blocked by a dozen Centaurian females crowding toward the portal . " Listen , " Giyt panted , catching up to him . " I really need to talk to Dr. Patroosh . " " But she does n't want to talk to you , Giyt . " " I 'll believe that when I hear it from herself . Mind telling me where she is ? " " I do mind , and , listen , Giyt , even if I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be left alone ? Considering what time those poor people finally got to bed ? Considering they got a full day 's work ahead of them ? Now would you please let me get this bunch in ? " There was no arguing with that . The Delt in the control group was already screeching furiously at Hagbarth to join them . Disgruntled , Giyt took his place in the rank of mayors . He hardly noticed when the chime sounded , the portal began to glow , the door opened and the four Centaurian VIP females , their husbands peering excitedly out of their fur , emerged . He was considering his next action . Perhaps Patroosh was staying at the Hagbarth house ; he could go there and demand entrance-preferably before Hagbarth himself got there . He did n't linger any longer than protocol absolutely demanded , but as he was heading for a cart a tiny Centaurian male scuttled through the crowd , calling his name . " Large Male Giyt ! This is I here , principal husband of Mrs. Brownbenttalon , you recall me ? Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of a hurry- " " Yes , surely . Deeply regret interrupting , but esteemed wife ask me to inform you . You wish find Earth female Patroosh , she say , having overhear you talk with Large Male Hagbarth person , correct ? She say good idea go see New Zealand Large Male . Thank you . Now must return instantly for completing of welcoming highranking co-species persons . " It took a lot of knocking and ringing to get anyone to answer the New Zealander 's door , and when the man showed up , half dressed , he looked seriously annoyed . Even more so when Giyt announced that he wanted to see Dr. Patroosh . " Who the hell are you ? " he demanded . " The mayor ? Oh , right , the bloke that wanted to bring weapons into Tupelo . What the hell did you want weapons for ? " " It was n't my idea . Can we talk about it some other time ? I just need to see Dr. Patroosh . " The New Zealander looked suddenly suspicious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Nothing . I just need to talk to her . " The New Zealander studied him for a moment , then shrugged . " Well , why do n't you come on in ? I think she 's probably out of bed by now . " So she was , but she was still wearing a wrapper over a frilly nightgown . It suited her , with her hair down ; in fact , she looked quite pretty , and Giyt could see why doubling up had not been a hardship for the New Zealander . She did not , however , seem pleased to see Giyt . " Yes ? " she said frostily . And she remained frosty while Giyt told her his shadowy suspicions about Hoak Hagbarth . The New Zealander was listening intently . When Giyt finished he said , " What 've I always told you , Amelia ? It was a mistake to let Tupelo be an allAmerican project . " Patroosh gave him a tolerant look . " But that 's only temporary , Jemmy . America 's where Ex-Earth has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special interest . But they say they 're definitely going to open it up to the rest of the world real soon now . " The New Zealander gave her a skeptical look . " I think we ought to listen to what this man has to say . " " Ah , Jemmy , " she said crossly , " do n't you think we 've got enough on our plate ? We 've got to bring up the question of exchanging ambassadors again , and that 's going to be a long , hard fight . " " But it 's important , " Giyt put in . She shook her head . " Listen , Giyt- " she began , and then hesitated . " Well , " she said at last , " I guess you ought to know . Hagbarth 's pretty down on you . Says he misjudged you . Does n't think you 're the right kind of person for the colony . And he has some stories about your wife- " Giyt 's expression hardened . " I know what he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care what he says about your wife . But it makes a problem . If the Ex-Earth rep and the mayor are feuding , it complicates things here . " " But if the Ex-Earth rep is committing a crime- " " Depends on what kind of crime it is , Giyt , " she said kindly . " The UN ca n't do anything about embezzlement out here , can it ? " " I do n't know that 's what it is , " he said obstinately . " It could be anything . It could be something that damages relations with the other planets . " " Yes , it could , " she agreed , " but we do n't know that , do we ? As far as I can see , we do n't know anything at all . " She meditated for a moment , then sighed . " Giyt , I 'll tell you what I 'll do . When I 'm back on Earth I 'll ask Interpol a few discreet questions . If they know anything , I 'll try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to thank her , wanting more action : " When will that be ? " " A while . The ambassador-exchange thing is going to take time . Maybe a couple of weeks , even . But that 's the best I can do . If you wanted me to do anything here you 'd have to have more evidence . Now will you please leave us alone so I can get dressed ? " More evidence ? All right , Giyt thought , I 'll give her more evidence . And when he got back to his home he asked Rina , " Do you think you 'd be all right by yourself if I went to the Pole for a day or two ? " XXIV Welcome , welcome , and welcome to our wonderful visitors from good old Mother Earth ! And a special welcome to our dear old friend , Dr Emilia Patroosh , who we all fondly remember from her visit here just a few months ago when she came to investigate the problems with the new generator system planned for Energy Island And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight 's the night ! Our own dear Hoak and Olse Hagbarth are having a cookout at their home and all six of our honored guests have graciously consented to be present to meet you . Everyone 's invited ! And I do n't have to tell you that a grand time will be had by all when we partake of that famous Olse Hagbarth hospitality ! See you there ! - Lt Silva Crist ! ' s broadcast The decision to go to the Pole was made . Implementing the decision was harder . The first thing Giyt tried was polling the other mayors about revising the passenger list for the polar rocket . He did n't get very far . The mayors were n't hostile , exactly , but they were clearly unwilling to get into a dispute between Earth humans . Even Mrs. Brownbenttalon was no help . " Could gladly give to you Centaurian seats if available , Large Male Giyt , " she said , " but fact is got no Centaurians going this trip or not next trip either , too . Wait . I maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kalkaboo High Champion on her own to see if he could be got to turn a seat loose . That did n't work , either . Downcast , she reported : " New Kalkaboo High Champion no better than old Kalkaboo High Champion . Talk much . Do little . Say always permanently willing helping out good friend and assassin of predecessor who has made amends therefore , Earth Human Giyt , but not in this particular case . Say friend Giyt surely aware delegation of high persons from home planet presently present here and maybe would not be approving . " " Well , he could ask them , " Giyt said . " Certainly could . I spoke so also . He say not advisable , could cause problem . What sort problem he mean , " she added , " is maybe home planet bosses might be annoy , could think stinky new Kalkaboo High Champion not as good as stinky old one . Stupid , you think ? Sure . But what you going do ? Is how Kalkaboos are , mostly . Now . let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either . When Giyt had to report failure to his wife she was warmly sympathetic . " Look on the bright side , hon. Here are all these people that are n't even human , and they do their best to help you-some of them , anyway . " " A very few of them , " he grumbled . " And what the Delt said was that he 'd do it in a minute , but the Slugs would have a fit because they 're naturally scum , I hate the way these people talk about each other . " " Why ? It 's just talk , Shammy . " " It 's not the kind of talk I 'm used to , " he insisted . She sighed . " You 've led a sheltered life , hon. When I was a kid in Newark Mom was always making little jokes about the drunken Irish and the dumb Poles , and we all talked mean about the Protestants , and we and the Protestants never had a good word to say about the Afros or the Asians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , and our parents all got together for the Fourth of July parade and the Christmas baskets for the poor . The eeties just talk that way , hon. They get along . They 've been doing it for hundreds of years , you know , and never any big fights . Which is a lot more , " she added ruefully , " than you can say about any of our countries back on Earth . " Giyt considered trying to stow away on the rocket-impossible-or just showing up at the launch pad and trying to bully his way aboard-just as impossible . Then he faced up to reality . He only had one alternative left . He had to swallow his pride and ask Hagbarth for help . That was n't easy , and what made it harder still was that he could n't get Hagbarth on the screen ; his personal access did n't respond , and when Giyt tried the one for the Hagbarth house it was jammed up . He would have to do it in person . When he got to Hagbarth 's house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the delegates was in full swing . He had to abandon his cart half a block away , because hundreds of people were swarming around the house . As he tried to pick his way through the crowd he got surprised looks from nearly everyone , some uneasily reluctant to meet his eyes , some staring at him with frank loathing . He was still a dozen meters from the front door when Hagbarth himself came steaming up . " What are you doing here , Giyt ? " he demanded . " I want to go to the Pole , " Giyt said . Hagbarth did n't laugh . He barely smiled-well , " sneered " might have been a better word , though he spoke mildly enough . " Ca n't be done . Do n't you follow the weather reports ? They had this big blizzard at the Pole . They 're still digging out . No time to have tourists . " " I 'll take my chance . " " Well , Giyt , you wo n't . Not this time . There 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention at the Commission meetings , either ? You guys allocated us two seats , and they have to go to highly qualified technicians just waiting for a ride ; we need them on duty there , Giyt . The factory might break down without them . Maybe next time . " " Which is when ? " " Well , " Hagbarth said reasonably , " how can I tell ? You never know when some of these home-planet peo ple might take it into their heads to bump everybody and go up and take a look for themselves . Maybe next week . Maybe not . Now I 've got guests to attend to . " In the end , it was n't Hagbarth or any of the eeties he 'd asked who gave Giyt help . It was Rina . " Hon ? " she said , coming into where he was bent over his screen again , sounding doubtful . " I do n't know if it 's such a good idea . It would n't be comfortable , that 's for sure- " " What would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Petty-Prime female , the one that 's married to the horticulturist ? You 've seen her over here . Anyway , she says they 've got space reserved for their whole family on the rocket . They 're willing to wait . So , if you 're sure you really want to go there ... " XIV The polar powerplant was primarily Delt , in both construction and operation . The mines were largely Kalkaboo , though the Centaurians and the Slugs had combined on the lab work that made possible the processing of the ores . The factories were everybody 's . In its original form the polar complex began with three structures , set at the vertices of an equilateral triangle . One of the structures is for the Centaurians , one for the Slugs , the third common to both for shipping and warehousing ; it is near this third building that the landing and launch pad for the suborbital rocket is located . Two kilometers away is the dock for the robot submarines which carry heavy cargo to the island settlement This is kept ice free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves are often banked high with drifts . Earth 's single structure is one of four hived off from the original Centaurian structure , the other three being an additional dome for the Centaurians and two which are the property of the Petty-Primes. - Britannica on-line , " Tupelo " The opening session of the six-planet meeting was n't scheduled to begin for nearly three hours , but a lot of the delegates and their staffs were roaming the town . In the cart to the lakefront Giyt saw clumps of them wandering around like tourists anywhere , taking pictures , getting souvenirs . Giyt was n't paying much attention to them . His mind was concerned with the prospect of making a polar flight under the conditions the PettyPrimes " generosity made possible , while Rina was n't looking at the visitors at all . She was withdrawn and worried . It was n't until they were getting into the boat for the ride across to the launch pad on the far side of the lake that she glanced at the other passengers and said in consternation , " They 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even have boots . It 's winter up there ! " Giyt had noticed the same thing , but tried to reassure her . He would n't be out of doors at all , he promised . It did n't satisfy Rina . " No , Shammy , " she announced , " you need somebody to take care of you . I 'm going to come along . " She very nearly did board the ship at the last minute , as a matter of fact . Very likely would have done it , too , in spite of everything , if there had happened to be an available unoccupied seat in the Pole rocket . But there was n't . " No more seats , certainly none at all , definitely not any , no , " the Delt at the door announced morosely . " Two seats remain open now for Earth-human persons , yes , but taken . Persons are late , too ! Persons better damn come soon so captain get this vehicle back in time for watching of opening ceremonials , otherwise captain be damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space , " Giyt informed him . The Delt gave him the benefit of a concentrated stare from both eyes . " You what ? " " It 's all right . The Responsible One gave his permission for the switch . " " Ho ! " the Delt snarled . " Responsible One ? Gave permission ? That very sweet , but , tell me , is Responsible One perhaps person who must now have task of to remove Petty-Prime seating structures from vehicle , so as to make physically feasible space for person your volume ahd mass to occupy ? Still more not to be forgiven injustice ! " As he turned to enter to do the job he flung over his shoulder , " For female Earth human person , still no . Not possible at all . " Giyt turned to Rina . " So you see there 's no room . But I 'll be all right . " " Maybe so , " she granted dubiously , " but also maybe not . What if these other people do n't show ? Then there 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a faint hope , quickly dispelled ; the sound of a motor from across the lake was what dispelled it . A boat was speeding toward them , and as it was slowing down to touch shore Giyt saw who was in it . There was a driver , and two men huddled in parkas behind him . " Damn ! " Giyt muttered . The men were Wili Tschopp and Hoak Hagbarth . When the driver exited it turned out to be Olse Hagbarth , unctuously friendly . " Came along to see your hubby off ? " she asked , chummy enough to make a cow puke . " Me too . Is n't that always the way for us wives ? We stay home with the housework while our men go off-what ? You go along with him ? Oh , no , hon , you must n't think about going along . Even if there was space for you . The acceleration in that rocket is fierce ! Not so bad for a healthy man , maybe , but do you have any idea what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Giyt 's big fear was that his wife would punch Olse Hagbarth in the face , but she did n't . Rina allowed herself to be led morosely away across the charred surface around the pad , and Giyt hoisted himself into the entry door as the Delt mechanic brushed past him . He paused to speak to Giyt , half apologetic , half aggrieved . " Is now as good as can make it , which not in fact specially good , you know ? You having nasty ride . Do not later speak did n't tell you so . " When Giyt tried to strap himself in he had to agree . The space intended for eight Petty-Primes was , in fact , large enough to hold an adult human male , but only if the human squeezed himself into the fetal position , knees almost touching his chin . As the Slug pilot came by , checking everyone 's fastenings , he made a sound of reproach at Giyt . " Not proper stowage ! " he slurped . " Can cause most grave discomfort in delta-vee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deceleration modes , otherwise potential for snapping of structural members . Not ship 's . Yours . " Giyt prepared himself for the worst , his thoughts on this new development . What was he to do about the presence of Hagbarth and Tschopp on the suborbiter ? They could have only one reason for this last-minute decision to come along . That was to keep an eye on him , and that he could not allow . He would have to lose them somehow .... Then there was no more time to think . The Slug pilot extended himself to the front of the vessel-actually , in its present takeoff position , to its top . In the surveillance mirror over the pilot station Giyt could see the Slug taking his place at the controls . He did n't have a seat , exactly All the other passengers , except Giyt , had custom-tailored sitting ( or perching ) places . All the pilot had was a sort of rubbery bowl . As it turned out , that made good sense . The pilot did n't bother to warn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to . Giyt heard the rolling thunder of the rockets beneath him , The craft began to shake . The noise grew louder until it was all but unbearable , and then the ship slowly began to lift . Then it picked up speed .... That was when Giyt saw the wisdom of the form-fitting chairs . He knew perfectly well what g-forces were supposed to be like , because everybody did . At least , he had thought he did ; but he had not expected how hard the platform he was resting on would become , or that his chest would be compressed until it was hard to breathe , or that the keycard in his hip pocket and the clasp of suspenders at the small of his back would suddenly feel like knives thrusting into his flesh . He could not see how the other passengers were faring , but in the overhead surveillance mirror he could catch glimpses of the Slug , now compressed into a sort of thick pudding in the bowl , his eyestalks pulled back into his body , a few tendrils stretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then the noise stopped . The pressure was gone . The rocket was in the ballistic portion of its flight now , with no thrust at all , and no weight . Giyt took a deep breath , savoring the pleasure of breathing freely again . He glanced toward the passengers next to him , the pair of male Delts who were already twisting their heads to check the condition of their mates behind a pair of similarly packed Kalkaboos . Everyone was chattering away-incomprehensibly to Giyt , because somewhere along the acceleration the translation button had been pulled out of his ear by the g-forces . While he was hunting for it he heard peremptory gurgling from the Slug and looked up . The pilot , restored to three dimensions , had hoisted himself out of his cup and was growling at Hoak Hagbarth . Who had unstrapped himself and was floating free , coming toward Giyt . " I know , I know , " Hagbarth snapped at the pilot . " I 'll get back when I have to . " And then to Giyt : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he never gets to the bag in time . Look at me ! " He was dabbing at his knee , where there was a definite smear of something on his pants that smelled nasty . Giyt could hear the sounds of Wili Tschopp busily vomiting in the seat just above him . Giyt did n't answer him . He managed to stretch an arm to retrieve the translation button he had just spotted wedged into the back of Tschopp 's seat . He did n't trust himself to speak . Hagbarth hesitated on his way to the toilet . " I guess you 're wondering why we 're here , with the six-planet meeting going on and all . " " Actually , " Giyt said , " I 'm not . " And replaced the button in his ear as he closed his eyes . And did n't speak to Hagbarth again . Coming back to the surface was n't worse than the takeoff , but it was n't appreciably better , either . If Giyt was n't having the breath squeezed out of him quite as much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaking and bouncing about as they reentered the atmosphere . Then the ship danced around a bit on its rockets as the pilot finally did in fact do a little piloting , making sure it was centered on the polar factory pad before he let the craft drop onto its massive shock absorbers for the last half meter or two . Then they were there . They had to wait , strapped in their seats-waiting , Giyt supposed , while people outside foamed the ground the landing rockets had broiled . Then everyone began getting into their cold-weather gearthose that had it , anyway , which is to say everybody but Evesham Giyt . A moment later , responding to some cue from outside , the Slug pilot slithered down past the passengers , bulky in his rubbery cocoon of electrically heated fabric . He wrenched the door open and , without saying a word , left the ship . Giyt took that to be permission to do the same . So did everyone else , all at once . Even after Giyt got himself free of the restraining gear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tangle of other passengers and out into the shockingly frigid wind . The cold made him catch his breath , which actually hurt as it entered his lungs . It would have been even worse if it had n't been for the foamed , but still hot , ground underfoot No , he discovered . It was n't ground , and it was n't foamed , either . What was underfoot was mud , soaked by the melting snow and cooked to a slurry by the landing rockets . It was still steaming , and it was ruining his shoes . They were in a sort of well surrounded by snowbanks , and meltwater was still gurgling away through culverts . Someone had gouged out a series of planked steps to get them to the top of the snow , where a duckboard path led them to the waiting hovers . Giyt ran toward them , but Hoak Hagbarth ran faster . He was there before Giyt , panting and irritable , no longer bothering to pretend to be friendly . " This one , " he ordered , pointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Giyt did as told ; this was not the time to try making a break . A Delt followed him , then Wili Tschopp , morose and shaky from his airsickness . Giyt was shivering , too , his teeth chattering , but at least the car was relatively warm . The bad part of the warmth was that both Tschopp and Hagbarth , though swaddled in their bulky parkas , definitely stank . The Delt took one look at them with both his wandering eyes , then conspicuously leaned away from them as the car began to move . A few hundred meters away , the factory buildings were bathed in light . Giyt squinted at them , trying to reconcile the remembered schematics of the polar complex with what was before his eyes . Most of the buildings were the familiar golden domes of Delt architecture , linked by their mole-run connecting tunnels , but what the car was heading for was a chunky , square-edged block , ten meters high but dark and windowless . That , Giyt realized , would be the central facility , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stop outside , but went right through an aircurtain door without pausing . Inside , they were in a bare room , corridors leading away from it in several directions . There was a sort of reception desk , untended except for a Delt technician , who roused himself from sleep to greet the Delt from the rocket . There was a distant thudding of heavy machinery in operation somewhere not too far away . Happily , the building was warm . The two Delts disappeared in the direction of their dome while Tschopp and Hoak Hagbarth headed for toilet facilities-not the same ones , Giyt noticed-to clean up . " Wait here . Maury 'll come and show us around , " Hagbarth growled as he left . That Giyt did not propose to do . He looked swiftly around to orient himself . He knew that the Earth dome , as the latest built , was part of a necklace of two other domes , the Centaurians 's and the Petty-Primes 's . Since the factory plenum belonged to everybody , the wall readouts were in a wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curlicues of Petty-Prime script on one door and ducked into it . He hurried down the broad hall on the other side until he was almost run over by a pair of forklifts , one with a human driver and the other slaved to the first oneon the way , no doubt , to offload cargo from the rocket . " Excuse me , " he called over the grinding whine of the forklifts . " I 'm Evesham Giyt-the mayor , you know . " The driver was muffled in coldweather gear , but his face mask was hanging loose from his helmet . " Really ? " he said in surprise . " Still ? " Giyt disregarded it . " Am I going right for the human factory dome ? " The driver took his time about answering . " Should n't you be with somebody ? " he asked . " Of course not . I 'm the mayor . " The driver brooded over that for a moment . " Well , " he said , " most of the guys have taken some personal time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know . " He thought for a moment longer , then added doubtfully that he did n't personally get to the factory very often , but if Giyt wanted to keep going to the Centaurian control room there was a female there , stuck with the duty like himself , who might know the way . And who liked to gab . And , since the whole operation was of course automated , did n't have much else to do . Giyt did n't hesitate . It would n't take Hagbarth and Tschopp much longer to make themselves presentable , and he did n't want to waste his best chance to get rid of them . He found the Centaurian control room easily enough , and at least part of what the forklift driver had said was true . The Centaurian shift manager was curled up on a pad in front of the controls , lying on her side with her paws relaxed and displayed : three of them were white , the other the dun color of her fur . A wall screen was dis playing the opening ceremonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . She was murmuring softly to the husband who was nestled in the soft fur under her chin . They did not look as though they wanted to be interrupted . But the male was peering at Giyt with bright eyes , and when he whispered something to his mate she turned her snout toward the door . " What person are you ? " she demanded . " I 'm Evesham Giyt . I 'm looking for the Earth-human factory dome . " " You got visiting permission pass ? No ? You got no chance going that place alone , Large Male . You go away or I call-wait one . " Her husband was whispering to her . Then she looked at Giyt in a different way . " Oh , " she said . " You Mayor Large Male Evesham Giyt . You guy bitched up stinky Kalkaboo guy , right ? Why had not spoken so right away ? " " That was just an accident- " he began instinctively , but she was still talking . " Mrs. Brownbenttalon litter-sister of my junior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She say you pretty good guy . I also think it ; damn Kalkaboos always getting damn feelings hurt . You want see Earth-human dome , sure , Mr. Threewhiteboots here take you , show you where everything located , no problem . But when you are got there , please , you tell him quickly hurry right back . " The little male took Giyt in a Centaurian cart-no seats , just a sort of pad with grips to hold onto-and when he had delivered Giyt to the human autofactory dome he did n't wait to be told to hurry back . He was quickly gone , to whatever intimate moments the couple had been heading toward . There was a screen , and a door , but the door was n't open . The human autofactory , of course , was locked . Giyt could hear rumblings from inside . That meant nothing about whether anyone was there ; the nature of an autofactory was that it was automatic . Likely enough anybody who was supposed to be on shift had taken off to watch the opening ceremonies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fingers and sat down at the screen . There were not many combinations or passwords that could keep Evesham Giyt out , and it took only five minutes to establish that this was n't one of them . When he entered the chamber the rumbling sounds were louder . They came from where a cascade of the talking dolls were dropping out of the assembly machine onto a moving belt , to be picked up by the packing members and stowed in shipping cartons . Several dozen filled cartons were already stacked against a wall , waiting for shipment . And none of that was of any interest to Giyt . He looked around and found locked storerooms . Those looked more promising . Their locks , too , were only a small inconvenience . But while he was working out the combination his screen buzzed and half a dozen legends appeared on it . The one in English said : Earth human Evesham Giyt has wandered away from his party . If you see him please inform Central Command of his whereabouts so he can be returned . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not remain so polite . One after another the locked doors opened . Behind the nearest one , in this warehouse where no one but humans ever went , was a store of Kalkaboo dawn-bangers-big , bomb-shaped firecrackers , of the size that required detonators . Behind the other doors Behind the other doors was worse . There was no reason for any Earth human to possess Kalkaboo firecrackers , even little ones , to say nothing of these monsters . But the other things in the locked storerooms simply had no business existing on Tupelo at all . They were Earthside weapons , and there were hundreds of them . Handguns . Minicarbines . Assault rifles . Grenades . Even mortars ; even shoulder-launched missiles , the kind that rocketed to an enemy 's position and then exploded with a shower of highvelocity shrapnel . And when he looked more closely at the missiles he saw the answer to two puzzles . The missiles bore sniffer vents . They would follow the airborne odor of a target and explode over the target 's head , and that explained why there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the eetie races on Tupelo . And to make them work required high-tech computation . . and that explained something , too . That had to be where the missing chiplets had gone . XXVI The story of human warfare can be told as the evolution of hand-held weapons . As the English longbow spelled the end of armored knights at Agincourt , the machine-gun marked the final defeat of the cavalry charge in World War L The Second World War produced a temporary reversal , as the major weapons became the airplane and the tank , while the foot soldier could do little more than exploit the breakthroughs that air and armor made for him . But then came the hand-held antitank rifle , the flamethrower and , most deadly of all , the shoulderlaunched bus . This was a missile that could carry any sort of weaponry-shrapnel , chemical agents , even mini-nukes . It would be programmed to explode at a given point or on detection of enemy troops , given away by their body heat , their sounds or even the aroma of their bodies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the foot soldier the equal of a tank . - Britannica on-line , " Weapons " The thought came too late to be useful , but if he had thought of it in time it would have been no trouble at all , Giyt told himself , to have brought a microcam along . He could be photographing the whole thing . Then he could be taking it to the people at the six-species conference , there to blow the whistle on whatever foretaste of hell Hagbarth and his buddies were planning for Tupelo . But he had no camera . What then ? There was plenty of evidence here . The trouble was that it was all too big to carry . He needed something small enough to hide on his person . There was no way he was going to get onto the return rocket-past Hoak Hagbarth-if he was carrying a shoulderlauncher or a carbine , much less one of the Kalkaboo bombs . Thoughtfully he pocketed a Kalkaboo detonator , but that would n't prove anything ; there were multitudes of them on sale in the Kalkaboo store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ammunition visible for the minicarbines , but the assault guns were loaded ; he slipped a clip out of one of them and stowed it away . Then he tackled one of the buses . If he could take one of them apart to get its chiplet out , that would remove all doubt . On Earth there were plenty of experts who would be able to read the programming on the chiplet , and that would show just what the thing had been built to do . Figuring out what had to be done was easy . The execution was a lot harder . The damn thing was n't meant to be disassembled . Worse , he had no tools . There probably were tools somewhere around , maybe in the same place as the ammunition for the minicarbines , but he did n't know where that was . So it would have to be a simple smash and pry operation-with the added worry at every step that if he hammered a tad too hard he might detonate the explosives and fuel in the bus . Time was a problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later Hagbarth and the others would be checking the factory in their search for him . By then he had to be elsewhere , and ready to give them some kind of lying apology for going off on his own . . . and hope they bought it . . . and then-if , against the odds , he had been lucky enough to get away with that muchsomehow manage to get back on the suborbital rocket 's return flight with his booty intact . He did n't quite see how he was going to manage any of that , but meanwhile he had the present job . Wonderfully he managed to get two of the buses open enough to fish out the chiplets , all the while rehearsing-and rejecting-the things that he might say to Hagbarth . Anyone who looked at the two buses would see they had been tampered with . For what good it might do he put them at the back of the stack . Then he locked all the storeroom doors , erased his programs from the screen , let himself out and relocked the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get far before he heard the whir of an approaching cart , and , of course , it was Hagbarth . Hagbarth was n't alone . Tschopp and that other man from the fire company-Maury Kettner ? - jammed the cart beside him . They all leaped out as soon as the cart had stopped , scowling angrily at Evesham Giyt . " Jesus , " Giyt cried enthusiastically , " am I glad to see you guys ! This place is wild : I finally did find the factory , but the damn thing 's locked up . " Hagbarth studied him thoughtfully without speaking . He gave Maury Kettner a nod ; the man turned and walked away as Hagbarth said , " So you were just wandering around , is that what you 're saying ? " " Trying to find the factory , " Giyt agreed , doing his best to see where Kettner was going ; afraid he knew the answer in advance , but seeing no choice but to tough it out . " This is a very confusing place , Hoak . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us ? " " Well , you took so long , " Giyt improvised , looking over his shoulder . Kettner had opened the factory door and disappeared inside . He was taking a long time in there , though . Had Giyt left some sign of his entrance ? " Anyway , " he added , " I ran into a couple of eeties , and they gave me directions . " " But when you got there it was locked . " " Locked , right , " Giyt agreed . Hagbarth nodded , poker-faced . " Was there any special part you wanted to see ? " " Oh , " Giyt said , shrugging vaguely , " just to get a general idea , you know ? So I 'll know what I 'm talking about when I see Mrs. Patroosh . " " She 's a busy woman , Giyt . You do n't want to bother her with a ldt of unimportant stuff . " " No , of course not , " Giyt agreed . " It 's just that . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened . Maury Kettner came out , and his expression was cold . Worse than that , he was carrying one of the carbines from the store , and Giyt observed unhappily that Kettner , at least , had known just where to go to find its ammunition clip . He was staring at Giyt , but it was to the others that he spoke . " He was into the stash , all right , " he said . " The seals were broken . " Hagbarth exhaled a sigh . " Ah , Giyt , " he said reproachfully , " what did you do that for ? More important , what are we going to do with you now ? " It was a rhetorical question . If aimed at anybody , it was at Evesham Giyt ; but it was Will Tschopp who answered it . " There 's always the Heckslider way , " he mentioned . It took a moment for Giyt to make the connection , and then Tschopp spelled it out for him . " You know about Harry Heckslider , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the way to Energy Island . See , he got curious , and he just would n't listen to reason . " " Now , wait a minute , " Hagbarth said good-naturedly . " Why do you think Evesham here would be like that ? You do n't have any special love for our alien brothers , do you , Evesham ? " Hagbarth 's tone was friendly enough-no , Giyt decided , a lot too friendly . The man was putting him on . He said , temporizing , " I 've got nothing against them . " " Really ? Not even the Kalks ? " " Well , I thought they gave me a lot harder time than was called for- " " Damn right they did ! I really hated to see them working you over like that , Evesham . Not that the others are all that much better . Ca n't ever trust any of the freaks , that 's what I say . You know they 've all been scouting Earth for years , do n't you ? " Giyt was honestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! They 've got their ships orbiting the Sun , watching us , learning everything about our capabilities-how do you think they got that portal to Earth so fast ? " " Why , I guess I never thought- " " No , " Hagbarth agreed bitterly . " You never did think . Most people did n't , but there they are , and you know what kind of weapons they 've got , because your Centaurian friend told you all about their old wars . " He was breathing heavily . He collected himself and spoke more reasonably . " Anyway , Evesham , you 're a patriotic guy , are n't you ? " I am ? Giyt asked , but not out loud . Actually he did n't know the answer . He had never given much thought to patriotism , but now . . Hagbarth was going right on : " I mean , you know what the score is . The freaks would do us in in a minute , if they had the chance . What do you think the Kalks have all those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't think of using them on the rest of us now and then ? And what do we have ? " " Well , " Giyt said , pretending to think it over , " I guess we have those water cannons . " Hagbarth grinned at him , then turned to the others . " See ? I told you he was n't so dumb . But that 's just piss-ant stuff , the water cannons . They could n't really save us if the freaks tried a coup . That 's what we need the other stuff for , right ? " Giyt gave another imitation of a man trying to work a hard question out . " Maybe you 're right , " he admitted . " One thing that kind of puzzles me- " " Yeah ? " " When you got me to try to get some weapons imported . Was that just so no one would think you already had some here ? " Hagbarth grinned and clapped him on the shoulder . " Smart , " he said admiringly . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything to anybody about what you saw , will you ? " " I guess not . " Hagbarth patted his shoulder again approvingly . " That 's good , Giyt . Glad to have you aboard . Just to make sure , you wo n't mind if we search you , will you ? " Giyt let out a long breath . He was not a violent man , and there were three of them . There was no way he could stop them if they wanted to search . " Oh , " he said , reaching inside his tunic . " You mean you 'd be looking for something like this ? " And he took out the Kalkaboo detonator and displayed it , wondering if they were too far from the bombs for it to work . " Hey ! " Tschopp yelled . " Careful with that thing ! " Giyt was careful . He pressed the button firmly and with care ; and , as it turned out , they were n't too far away at all . XXVII The segregation of industrial facilities at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species has its own private workplaces-but is a safety measure . The passages connecting the domes are secured with blastproof doors . In addition , the Delt-designed roofs , though massive enough to withstand any snowload likely to occur in this region , are deliberately designed with fault lines so that , in the event of an explosion , most of the force of the blast will be exerted upward . This is deemed necessary in case of accident , but no such accident has ever occurred . - Britannica on-line , " Tupelo " Giyt could see that Hagbarth 's mouth was moving . That was how he knew that the man was saying something , or , from his expression , most likely furiously bellowing something , but what Hagbarth was bellowing was drowned out in the thunderous crash and rumble from the doll factory . Giyt saw that the door to the factory was bulging toward them . For a moment he thought it would fly open , but it did n't ; it swelled and shuddered , but it held . As the echoes of the explosion died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hell have you done now ? " he asked , and did n't wait for an answer . With Kettner he raced to the door and tried to pull it open . It resisted . Kettner set down the minicarbine to get a better grip on the door , while Tschopp was staring after the other two , openmouthed incredulous and scarletfaced angry . Even a nonviolent man can find a little violence in him now and then . Giyt did n't pause to think . From behind Tschopp he kicked at the back of the man 's knees . As Tschopp went sprawling Giyt was already running , as far as he could get from the men with the guns-down the corridor , around a turn , through an open door , down another short hall . The hall ended in a doorway with a glowing orange sign over it . The sign was in the curlicues of the Delt language , but Giyt knew what it was : That door went to the outside world . He paused for the fraction of a second to consider . Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ? Did he have a choice ? Put that way , it was a simple decision . When he grasped the handle it was cold to the touch . When he pushed the heavy door open the blast that came in was colder still . He hesitated , thinking about just what it was going to be like to be out , dressed as he was dressed , in that fierce Arctic gale ; but he knew the others were not far behind him . Outside , at least , the dark might hide him . He stepped through , hugging himself against the freezing blast , and let the door close behind him . That was the first disappointment . It was n't really that dark . Overhead the colors of the aurora washed across the sky , rust-red and pale blue ; they were n't bright , but they were widespread , in places obscuring the icy bright stars . It was light enough to see by , surely . If Hagbarth and the others followed him out they could pick him out in a moment , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He floundered to where the winds had scoured away most of the snow and began to run . His lightweight shoes crunching against the gritty crust left from some earlier snowfall , his feet already feeling as though they were beginning to freeze . He expected at any moment to hear shouts from behind him , and then , no doubt , the pippity-pop of the minicarbine . Or did you ever hear the shot that got you ? Were n't the bullets moving faster than sound ? So perhaps he would hear nothing at all , but he would feel something , all right . What he would feel would be the punch-punchpunch of a dozen rounds from the minicarbine stitching themselves across his back . . . and that would be the last thing he ever felt , in the moment when life would come to an end for Evesham Giyt . The second disappointment was that there was nowhere to hide . Giyt thought wildly of clawing out a foxhole in the snow , maybe covering himself with the stuff . Not for long . Even assuming it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare hands that were already stiffening up , he knew what would happen then . Either they would find him anyway , or he would freeze to death . What he was doing was making it easy for Hagbarth and the others . They were n't likely to shoot him . Why bother , when shooting him meant they would have to explain away the bullet-holes ? While if they simply left him alone he would die of the cold . He could hear what Hagbarth 's semi-pious explanations would be : " I guess the poor son of a bitch must have done something stupid that caused the accident , you know ? And then he ran away , probably trying to hide , maybe in shock or something , and then he must 've got outside somehow . It 's really too bad , and I 'm going to hate having to tell his wife , but , Jesus , look at the damage the bastard caused ! " To have any chance at all of surviving Giyt needed to get back to the warmth inside . He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain in his nostrils . Instinctively he had been running back toward the rocket port , to the building just ahead that had to be where Mrs. Threewhiteboots and her mate were overseeing the instruments at the plenum .... There had been a door there , he remembered . There was , and just by the door , parked , was a Centaurian hovercar . He tried the door of the car , but it was locked , and his fingers were getting numb . Perhaps the Centaurians could help ? If he could get the door to the plenum open from outside .... As it turned out , he could n't . There was no external handle and not even anything to grip and try to pull it open . But when he had hammered on it long enough , freezing , despairing , it opened a crack and a long Centaurian snout poked inquiringly out to peer at him . It was hard enough for Giyt to try to explain what had happened , his limbs numb , his teeth chattering , and it must have been even harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the translation program . But Mrs. Threewhiteboots was quick to understand . " Damn right , " she said . " Something require being done . Never liked that stinky Large Male Hagbarth-no offense other Earth humans , all right ? So , OK , we hide you someplace . Warm you up . Come . " As it turned out , not all the tiny doors were for Petty Primes ; Mrs. Threewhiteboots held one open while her husband scuttled ahead , clucking and mewing to the chorus of tinier clucks and mews that came from inside . A door that was built large enough to allow passage for a Centaurian was not meant for humans , but Giyt somehow managed to bend his stiffening body low enough to squirm through . At least it was warm inside the Centaurian lounge . It was dimly lit , and it also smelled quite horrible , likely because of the half dozen pups that were squirming around one of those elevated Centaurian sleeping pads . " New litter , " the female said proudly , cuffing them out of the way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now you come closer here , I hug you to defrostedness . " Her fur was soft , her body blessedly warm . The pups did n't like the idea of this alien monster preempting their mother 's embrace , but the male spoke sharply to them and they curled up sullenly against Giyt 's back . When he tried to talk she shushed him peremptorily . " You get blood running again , then have conversation . Not yet . " But then , as he felt life returning , he felt also a nearly overpowering urge to drift off to sleep . He resisted it ; his story could not wait . Haltingly he told Mrs. Threewhiteboots what he wanted to do . " You bet , sure , " she said . " Show proof to six-species gathering , good idea . So we take you to rocket , all right , let damn ugly Large Male Hagbarth try to stop us . " " But he has a gun , " Giyt remembered to say , between bouts of yawning . That produced a considerable silence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned and pushed his way out of the door . " Hate damn guns , " she said morosely . " That make things tough , right ? But we do best we can . Mr. Threewhiteboots go check things out . Now you sleep a little , understand me ? " It was an invitation hard to refuse . Against his better judgment Giyt let his eyes close . Perhaps Mr. Threewhiteboots would come back with help . Or perhaps he would raise the alarm , and the several dozen other persons in the polar complex , human or otherwise , would turn away from the opening ceremonies long enough to overpower Hagbarth 's few and convoy him to the rocket , and then to the Hexagon to show his chiplets to the council meeting .... But perhaps Hagbarth would not want to be overpowered . And he and his bullies did have that gun . The gun made all the difference . Of course , Giyt reasoned , it would make no sense for Hagbarth to start a shooting war here and now . Everything was against it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now , with the six-species council in session , and capable of summoning quick reinforcements from the parent planets . Most of all , Hagbarth 's illicit armorarium had vanished with the explosion of the Kalkaboo bombs . Shooting anybody would certainly not be a sensible thing to do . But , on the other hand , who had ever described Hoak Hagbarth as sensible ? A sudden twitch of alarm from Mrs. Threewhiteboots made Giyt open his eyes . That was a strange sensation , for what he saw was no different either way . Eyes closed , eyes open , there was only blackness . Was this what blindness felt like ? But it was n't his eyes that were at fault . " Is power out , " Mrs. Threewhiteboots said worriedly . " Power never out . Is bad thing . You stay here inside where no one can see , Large Male Giyt . I look . " That was an order he could not obey . As she peered out of the door Giyt was shoulder to shoulder with her . Power was out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was from one distant , palely glowing panel of green emergency lighting on the ceiling . He could see the plenum at the end of the hall , but the brilliant readout displays were gone , leaving only one fast-moving line of symbols on one wall . There were brighter moving lights just beyond there , too . Someone-no , several someoneswere there with pocket torches , And he heard voices . One of the voices was raised in anger , and it belonged to Hoak Hagbarth . Mrs. Threewhiteboots moaned something , then reared upright to peer down the hall . Something small was skittering rapidly toward them . It turned out to be her mate , who leaped into the fur of her back , chattering at her . She listened for a moment , then turned and shoved Giyt back inside . " They coming , maybe ! Go in ! Close door ! " The power was out , and so were communications . Mr. Threewhiteboots ( his mate explained to Giyt ) had gone to the communicator ; but that was when the power went . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sound the alarm two large Earth-human males had come in . " They asking you , Large Male Giyt , " the female reported . " My husband hear you name , but nothing else ; he not have translator . They talk at him , but he not understand nothing . Then they point stinky gun at him . He run . " " Hell , " Girt said . Communications dead , access to the rocket blocked : Was there any way out of this ? He thought rapidly . " Are they still there ? " " Think not . Do n't want to look . You want ? " " No . Well , maybe I do , but not right away . They wo n't stay around . Then maybe I can- " But he stopped there , because he knew , before he said it , that they would never let him get to the rest of the complex . They would let no one in or out until they had made sure Giyt was not still inside . Then he remembered what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath , then opened the door a crack , listening . The Centaurian pups were whining softly , but he heard nothing else , and it was dark outside . When he poked his head out there were no lights . There would be no better chance than this . " Mrs. Threewhiteboots , " he said , " do you have a keycard for the hover ? If I could get around the outside to the rocket pad- " She made a snuffling sound that might have been amusement . " What you do with keycard ? You think you driving Centaurian hover ? " " Maybe you could tell me how to do it . " " Maybe you being very ridiculous , Large Male Giyt . Never happening ; driving instruments quite complicated . Also what you think those large males do , they finding us here and you gone ? No . Not giving keycard . Driving vehicle own self , most fearfully . " Mrs. Threewhiteboots delayed only to scrabble in a compartment for a body-shawl and a set of flat disks like snowshoes . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her husband and led the way to the door . The hovercraft started quickly and moved easily over the drifts . It took only a few minutes to reach the rocket launch pad . And then they stopped , looking at each other , looking back at the dome they had left . There were more of those hand-held lights moving around there . They looked like they belonged to human beings-did belong to human beings-undoubtedly belonged to some of Hagbarth 's people , searching for them . If they went back there they would be caught . But there would n't be much point in trying to do that , anyway . The pad was empty . The suborbital rocket itself was gone . XXVIII With heartfelt sadness I have to tell you all , dear friends , that there is n't any doubt any more . Our mayor , Evesham Giyt , was definitely lost in that terrible explosion at the Pole . So , folks , I think it 's time for us all to show what big hearts we have here in Tupelo . Never mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to cost us all-many months of lost production , and I do n't even want to think about how much money . Say nothing mean about the dead and gone , folks , no matter how much of a mess the guy made . Probably he just did n't know any better maybe . So let 's forget that part of it and just give our deepest sympathy to his grieving widowwho , you know , is probably going to be leaving us herself before long . - Lt . Silva Cristl 's broadcast When Rina was awakened with the word that Giyt was missing and presumed dead she did n't believe it . Would n't believe it . And then , when she accessed the Earth-colony news channel , had no choice but to believe it , because the scenes of destruction from the Pole were too terribly convincing to be denied . In the view from outside , the Earth autofactory dome was split completely open , oozing black smoke into the dark polar sky . In the view from inside everything was simply wrecked . Rina sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat a bit of the breakfast she had absently made for herself , sometimes simply sitting motionless , not even thinking . When the news items began to repeat themselves she switched to other files , her lessons , her household reminders , sometimes Giyt 's own files . . . but that was painful ; because he was n't there . Lupe was the first to arrive at the house . " Oh , Rina , hon , " she said , her voice as mournful as her face , and stopped there because she had nothing to add . She sat quietly next to Rina , holding her hand . Then it was Matya , with the younger children , the others busy getting themselves off to school . Matya was more businesslike , and full of news . The six-planet meeting was convening early to discuss the accident . The loss of life , at least , had been small-two eeties missing and supposed to have been caught somehow in the blast . And Giyt . The suborbital rocket had made an emergency flight to the Pole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was already on its way back for more . The economic consequences for the Earth community were worrisome ; until the autofactory could be rebuilt everything would have to come by portal from the home planet . As would everything needed for the rebuilding ; the Earth delegation had already sent a message back to Earth to say what had happened and that emergency help was needed . Rina listened to it all politely-having , of course , already heard it all for herself on her screen-until Lupe finally gave up trying to force food on her , and Matya insisted that she go back to sleep . It was easier to pretend to obey than to argue , but Rina knew that sleep was impossible . Well , not quite impossible . Rina had taken it as given that she would lie wakeful in the bed that still bore traces of Evesham Giyt 's friendly male odor , while horrid thoughts recirculated through her brain . However horrid , they needed to be thought anyway : Should she stay on Tupelo ? Go back to Earth ? Bear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abort it ? All of those unpleasant thoughts had subsidiary thoughts , just as unpleasant , that followed instantly from the first : wondering about what life would be like as a single parent ( or about what childless life would be like if she aborted the one thing she had left of Evesham Giyt ) . And what should , or could , she do about Hoak Hagbarth ? They were ponderous thoughts that would keep anyone awake ; one way or another . They were all attempts to discern whether she had anything left that was worth the trouble of going on living for , and the first she knew that she had gone to sleep after all was when Lupe touched her shoulder to wake her . " It 's Mrs. Brownbenttalon , " Lupe whispered . " She just wants to pay her respects . " Actually the Centaurian female had brought more than sympathy . She had n't come alone ; with her was a nearly grown female , painfully lugging two large packages wrapped in green fabric . " This shade of green our frequency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Contents of package food and drink . Hey , everybody know have no time for cookery with death in family . You meet my third daughter , Miss Stubnose ? You say hello , Miss ; good , now go back home . " She crawled up onto a couch , and acknowledged introductions to Lupe and Matya . " Yes , very sad happening , " she agreed . " Have serious pain in abdomen , right here where husband mostly hang , for you , Mrs. Large Male Giyt . You main husband damn good son of a bitch . You know I also lose close family members in cataclysmic event ? " That took Rina by surprise . " You did ? " The matriarch bobbed her long snout mournfully . " Esteemed wife of male littermate Mrs. Threewhiteboots gone missing , perhaps caught in blast , also secondary husband of same . No trace found , damn Hagbarth claims must have been trespassing in Earth factory at accident time . Untrue . Mrs. Threewhiteboots never waste personal time in dumb Earth human factory . " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It not you guilt , " Mrs. Brownbenttalon sighed . " Simply accident , surely . Reason I sorrowing , six babies of littermate 's esteemed wife now orphans , very sad . But , " she added strongly , " remember I still friend ; you need any kind help you ask . " " Thank you , " Rina said . " I think Lupe 's making tea , would you like some ? " " Earth tea ? " Mrs. Brownbenttalon pondered for a moment . " Sure , why not ? Only why is Earth female Lupe waving at you in this fashion ? " The reason Lupe was trying to attract her attention turned out to be something on the kitchen screen , and when Matya turned on the one in the living room the face was Hoak Hagbarth 's , being interviewed by Silva Cristl as he got off the rocket at the pad . " - Total devastation , " he was saying to the interviewer . " No , we do n't know what the hell Giyt did , but somehow he blew up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll take to get it running again . And it 's dangerous up there , so Chief Tschopp has ordered half the fire company to the Pole to prevent any further loss of life . Giyt ? Oh , he 's dead all right , missus . He probably got blown up in that blast , I do n't know if we 'll ever find the pieces . But if he did n't maybe he staggered out into the snow , and then he just froze to death . " He shook his head . " The damage is just unbelievable , but you know what is the worst part of it ? It 's the way he left his poor widow and their unborn child- " That was more than Rina could take . " Turn the bastard off , " she said , her voice shaking with anger at the man . But the fury she felt had one good quality . It told her that she did have one definite thing to go on living for . When she was finally alone she considered how to set about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , at least she could avenge him . What was hard to see was just how to go about doing that . Giyt , damn the man , had not left a clear record of what it was that he knew or guessed . There were any number of items in his files that provided dues-a tabulation of chiplet imports paired for some reason with the shipping records of finished products ; a log of failed attempts to access the ongoing processing data from the Pole ; scraps of files that might have meant something , but without Giyt there to explain their relevance were simply puzzling . There was even a just-arrived packet of data from Earth that was directed to Evesham Giyt himself , but it was encoded . Perhaps there was something interesting in that , provided it was n't just a financial statement from one of Giyt 's half-dozen money dumps . The trouble was , Giyt was n't there to provide the key . It was high noon , then it was dark , then it was light again . When Rina could not stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and made the bed , so that company would n't think her a slob . And there continually was company , usually Lupe or Matya com ing by every few hours , and staying until she somehow managed to get them to leave again , usually by pretending to be sleepy-and often enough actually going to sleep . And getting up . And making the bed again . And repeating the process . She picked up things in one place and put them down in another , made herself meals but could n't always make herself eat them . She switched on the news channel : raucous times at the six-planet meeting as the eetie delegates joined in deploring the sloppy precautions the Earth humans had provided at the Pole ; warnings that there would be shortages of some consumer items until new shipments could be received from Earth , coupled with appeals to refrain from buying anything not urgently needed during the emergency . She watched only as long as her interest was held-not long-and then she turned the screen off again . If she had some technical help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be able to piece together whatever it was that Giyt had learned . But help from whom ? Was there anyone she could trust ? Or would anyone she asked for help be just as likely to be part of the problem ? But she could not let Hagbarth get away with whatever he was up to . So Rina sat down before the screen again and attacked the problem of decoding the data packet from Earth . It had been a long time since , under Giyt 's tutelage , she had done anything of the sort . It was like riding a bicycle , she found . Once she got started she remembered the skills Giyt had taught her . She set up a program to try every possible password , feeding in every word she could imagine Giyt including . It took a while , but the program ultimately produced the password , which turned out to be " I guess I love Rina . " She cried at that , but only for a bit . Then grimly she began to study the packet . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an American expansionist conspiracy that reached up into high levels of the administration . They were planning to take Tupelo over . The autofactory at the Pole had been secretly manufacturing weapons . Rina sat back , considering . Then she called Mrs. Brownbenttalon . " It seems that I do need help , " she said . " Can you get me into the six-planet meeting ? " It was the first time Rina had been in the Hexagon since it was rearranged for the six-planet meeting . The six little platforms for the members of the Joint Governance Commission had been replaced with a cluster of seats ( or pads or trees ) to accommodate the high officials from the home planets ; there were from six to a dozen members of the appropriate species in each position , with most of the floor space given over to their staffs and experts . It was crowded . And , as they were all talking at once , it was also hopelessly noisy . Rina 's translator button struggled valiantly to render scraps of the other languages into English for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What came out was a sort of chowder of half-sentences and expletives , and she finally took the thing out of her ear . It eventually took the best efforts of the chief Centaurian delegate , Mrs. Oneeyewanders , a female so august that she had not one but three husbands scuttling about in her fur , to restore something like order . When she screeched for quiet the rumblings of the crowd simmered down enough for Rina to finish her testimony . And all the while , there were the Hagbarths standing in the little cleared space next to her , giving her poisonous looks , shaking their heads . Poisonous looks were all they could manage . It had not been smart of Hoak Hagbarth to send all his fellowconspirators in the fire company to the job of cover-up at the Pole , because the ones that were left behind were not part of the conspiracy . Behind the Hagbarths stood a pair of the brawniest fire police left on the island , and neither of the Hagbarths dared move . Then Rina accessed Giyt 's decoded packet from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart from indignant whisperings to each other , as the record unrolled . When it was over Dr. Patroosh was the first to speak , glaring at Hagbarth . " You scum , " she said . Then the Swiss chimed in-speaking in French , Rina guessed ; but her translator had not been equipped with French language capability and so she could make nothing of it until the New Zealander spoke up . " I agree completely , " he said . " We will all transmit this complete record to our governments at once . " " But it is all lies ! " Hagbarth burst out . " She made it all up ! Are you going to take the word of a whore against me ? " But they were taking it . Rina got the button back into her ear again in time to hear Mrs. Oneeyewanders speak up for her ; so did the Slug , on what grounds Rina could not imagine . Then the Kalkaboo piped up : " Exists here no problem believing statement of Earth human female . Can make factuality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present cleanup at the Pole , then quickly dispatch sixspecies delegation up there for total discovery of truthfulness . " It was the most sensible thing Rina had ever heard from a Kalkaboo , and it had its effect on Hoak Hagbarth . The man wilted before her eyes . He gave Rina an imploring look , while his wife ; sobbing , clutched at his arm . But if he wanted to speak he had no chance ; the whole assembly was talking at once again . So it was over . The accumulated fatigue of the last few days struck Rina then ; she looked around for a place to sit down , failed to find one , squatted on the floor , her head bowed . It was a moment of triumph , but she could n't feel exultation . It only meant that now she had to face up to the real questions of life continuing without the presence of Evesham Giyt . She did n't even notice that the assembly had quieted until one of the fire police poked her . She looked up . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform , clutching his pocket screen ; he was showing it to the Slug delegate , who looked , and raised his forebody to speak . As Rina hurriedly replaced her translator he was saying , " - interesting news from ship terminal at dam . Unscheduled robot sub has arrived at terminal with passengers . They are three . Are hungry , cold , very , very dirty , but not in the least dead . " XXIX URGENT . ACTION REQUESTED . Access attached files I ( data secured by Evesham Giyt ) and 2 ( statements of Hoak Hagbarth and Olse Hagbarth in Inter-Species Conference ) . Urgently recommend immediate full-scale investigation of Extended Earth Corporation and all persons named in accompanying files . If allegations in attached files are supported , further recommend indictments for conspiracy to initiate military action on Tupelo , in violation of existing compacts . By unanimous decision of all five other species involved all sessions of the conference are suspended until this matter is resolved . - Tupelo Delegation Dispatch to UN As their boat raced across the lake to the dam . Lupe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband on the other , Rina at last let herself cry . Mrs. Brownbenttalon examined the process with interest . " Leakage from eyes indicates sadness , I have information , " she called , over the whine of the motor and the rush of the air . " This leakage not necessary , Mrs. Large Male Giyt . You husband alive OK ; he remember robot sub can take home as easy as rocket , only slower . Like I say , he damn good son of a bitch , smart too ! " At some point , Rina told herself , she should explain to Mrs. Brownbenttalon that there were such things as tears of joy . Not now . Now she was fully concentrated on peering ahead at the dock area , looking for the person she most wanted to see in all the worlds . There were Delt technicians supervising the hoisting of cargo from the base of the dam to the lakeshore ; there were Slugs watching the proceedings with a proprietary air-well , the ship terminal was in Slugtown . But it was n't until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she saw the hoist coming up again , and this time bearing two figures-well , three if you counted the little one poking his snout out of his Centaurian mate 's fur . Beside her Mrs. Brownbenttalon squealed and rushed to greet them , but not so fast that she beat Rina to the scene . And then they had each other in their arms-Giyt shaky , dehydrated , dirty , but entirely alive . " Shammy , Shammy , " she whispered in his ear . " You scared the shit out of me . " " I 'm sorry , " he said , sounding as though he meant it . " I could n't figure out any way to let you know I was all right without letting Hagbarth know , too . Now let 's get back to town . They were making munitions up at the Pole ! I 've got evidence that 'll prove it- " " I turned it over to the council already , " Rina told him . " - And I have to get it to- You what ? " His mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he shook his head , looking at her wonderingly . " Jesus , woman , " he said . " Looks like you 're perfectly capable of getting along just fine without me . " " Why , " Rina said with satisfaction , " I actually never doubted I could . I just do n't want to . "
