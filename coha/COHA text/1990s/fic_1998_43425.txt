NESTOR FRIK PLAYED A GAME with himself . The object was to make his box of Goobers last . Through announcements about no smoking , courtesy to other patrons , refreshments provided for your convenience , management 's willingness to address complaint , and coming attractions . It was a tantalizing exercise in restraint . <p> The rules of the game required that he strip the cellophane from his Goobers box , rip a tiny window in the upper right corner and allow himself only two preliminary Goobers . He could savor the chocolate skin , then crunch on the peanuts hidden inside , or he could bite down and pulverize both Goobers instantly for the sudden delicious rush . But , until the feature , and only after opening titles ended , he was not to devour another Goober or even allow one to slip through the carton 's exit into his hand . <p> Once the film began , there were no further restrictions . The game was over . He 'd either won or lost . More often than not , Nestor lost . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the writer or director . The first Goober set off such urgent greed , liberated so much desire , that he usually gave up on will power and spilled the remaining Goobers , brown nuggets of pleasure , helter-skelter into his palm and shuttled them to his chocolate-craving , peanut-primed mouth . <p> He felt anger and guilt when he realized the box had emptied so quickly . A sudden flood of saliva splashed around his tongue . But so what ? He never took the game too seriously . There were no other players to gloat . His sins were committed in the flickering theater dark . His Goobers game was not a matter of life or death . It was something he did , just silliness . <p> This time , though , he was doing well . The lights had long since faded , announcements and coming attractions played out , the feature begun and Nestor had his Goobers intact . He was pleased by the tiny victory . It balanced so many defeats . <p> The woman sitting next to him , a gross stranger , made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon . Nestor never liked Raisinettes . They were too sweet , too yielding . A patron behind him spilled buttered popcorn , then crushed the lost kernels with a vindictive sneaker . The attraction of oily popcorn evaded Nestor . To each his own , still , the choice of Goobers said something about a person . <p> During the opening scene , the Raisinette woman threw her depleted box under her seat and shifted heavily from side to side . For the moment , Nestor controlled the arm rest that separated them . His Goobers were firmly under control . He could ration them in ones and twos or gulp a dozen . <p> He had all his options open . The woman knew it , the spiller behind him probably sensed it . Her candy was squandered , his wasted popcorn already turned to dander . Nestor settled into the comfortable theater seat and gently rattled his Goobers box , confirming its content , feeling its weight , taunting his shadowy neighbors . " Jesus , " he thought , embarrassed by his own gloating , " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd come to see , Billy Eiffel , had earned all kinds of praise . It was featured in the Times ' Arts and Leisure , in New York Magazine , cherished by Siskel and Ebert who 'd waved enthusiastic thumbs . Nestor knew it had something to do with a Native American living in Paris but he had n't read beyond the headlines in the Times or New York , nor had he focused closely on the television pundits . <p> What really motivated him to see the movie was that , in addition to media raves , it had come up in two disparate conversations . One was with a client in Denver during a sales meeting , the other with Susan Acorn , a girl he knew from his building laundry and who was somehow involved with ballet . <p> Nestor was a curious man who recognized the importance of keeping alert to the cultural environment . The problem was , his work swallowed him up . It was the way of things at a time when the economy was suspect and competition increasingly vicious . Every sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathe . <p> So , he created a guideline . If a film , book , play , or even a song came to his attention three times , if it achieved triangulation , he made the time to find out about it firsthand . <p> Awareness of current " ins " was not only important socially , but for business . The client in Denver , for example , represented potential millions to his company and Nestor had to tell the man , " No , I have n't seen Billy Eiffel , though it is on my list . " As for Susan Acorn , he sensed her displeasure even though their conversation took place between floors in an elevator . " Yes , I know it 's playing over at the Quad , but I 've been on the road more than I 've been home the past month . So , is it as good as they say ? " <p> If he 'd been on firmer ground , who could say what might have followed . She brought up the subject , gave him the bait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the chance to play catchup , I promise to see Billy Eiffel and we 'll compare notes . " But Susan Acorn was by nature a girl who made spontaneous judgments . Nestor saw her eyes go blank . <p> Of all the popular arts , films were certainly the most essential when it came to communication . They eclipsed even sports except during the World Series or the Superbowl . Nestor knew he should have seen Billy Eiffel because it was there and before it could be used against him . <p> And now he was about to see it . He let his mind dissolve like the Goober he tongued as he gave himself to the opening scene , a montage of Left Bank vignettes . The camera zoomed in on a beautiful young woman at a sidewalk cafe . She lifted an infant from a sack on her back , unbuttoned her blouse and began to nurse what must have been a symbolic papoose given the subject of the film ( probing , intense , a single parent you wo n't forget , a brilliant evocation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't afford to miss ) . <p> Nestor watched the baby suckle at a perfect breast . The woman 's black hair cascaded over her huge , silent eyes . She had wonderful cheekbones and a straight , determined nose . Just as she began to hum a lullaby , the screen blotted out . Her tranquil image was replaced by the broad back and huge head of a man who flopped into the seat in front of Nestor 's , probably the last free seat in that small theater . <p> Nestor flexed at the obstacle . He bent his own head far to the right until he was nearly cheek-to-cheek with the Raisinette lady who , in turn , shifted uncomfortably . <p> Nestor 's new position was not only uncomfortable , it was pointless . The wall still blocked most of the screen . Nestor tried sitting taller but that was no better . The massive head in front of him was crowned with a burst of hair that grew in bristles like the foliage on a Chia Pet . <p> Nestor ate his Goobers , tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He listened to floating French voices for some sense of continuity , but his efforts were futile . He might as well have been sitting with a bag over his head . Nestor remembered that , long ago , at summer camp , sadistic counsellors forced rebellious campers to watch the weekly movie facing backwards . <p> Fuming but inert , he stayed to the end , grasping what he could of Billy Eiffel . He pushed his way up the aisle when the film was done , trying to catch bits and pieces of audience reaction . The remarks he.heard echoed the critics , wonderful , fabulous , absolutely original . <p> In the lobby he stopped to adjust his coat . He felt himself shoved aside . While he regained balance , Nestor realized that the person who 'd nearly sent him sprawling was the same mountain that ruined his entertainment . The enormous whale of a man tried to cover his basketball head with a cap . " Piece of pretentious crap , " the man muttered , " crock of pure shit . There is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lautrec wannabe . No fucking way . Waste of time , waste of money . " <p> Nestor followed him out into the street and watched him lumber toward Sixth Avenue . So the movie was a love story and the Native American decided to stay with the physically challenged Algerian artist . That explained some of what Nestor managed to see through the narrow valley of vision . He ate his last Goober , then threw the box into a trash can and went home . <p> Some days later Nestor ran into Susan Acorn at their subway exit . They walked together making small talk about the weather , about life in New York , about nothing in particular . Then Nestor told her , " By the way , I managed to catch Billy Eiffel . " <p> " Did you ? What did you think ? " <p> Nestor swallowed his spit . He knew how important his reply would be to the flow of their tenuous relationship . " It was interesting . A bit fragmented , but definitely worth seeing . " <p> " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had problems with it , " Nestor said to his surprise . " I mean , it left me with a credibility gap . That such a girl , one might say an experienced girl from the reservation , would have no reservations about hitching her star to the fate of a handicapped artist ... " <p> " What artist ? You mean the bio-technician ? I suppose you could call him an artist of sorts . " <p> " The bio-technician , yes . He reminded me of Toulouse Lautrec . " " I can see that , yes . His mission was to create beauty and joy for others . " <p> " Beauty and joy , yes . But to be honest , I 've got to tell you that while I enjoyed segments , I found it a bit pretentious . " <p> " Predictable , you 're saying . I could agree with that . But the total impact ? " <p> " Generally powerful . Credit where credit is due . " <p> " I 'm glad you felt that . Nestor , I wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I 'll wam you , I 'm a white wine and candles type of person . " <p> " White wine and candles would be very welcome . " <p> The next morning Nestor left Susan Acorn 's studio and went downstairs to his own place . He showered , dressed and made himself a cup of decaf tea , then called his client in Denver . " Dave , I expected to catch your voice mail . What time is it out there ? Dawn ? What do you do , milk the cows ? " <p> " Does n't everybody ? I 've been going through your presentation . " " And ? " <p> " It 's close to the mark , Nestor . My reaction is positive . " <p> " Good , Dave . By the way , last evening I got to see Billy Eiffel . That film you mentioned . And I want to thank you for nudging.me to see it . Powerful stuff . " <p> " That Indian maiden is some piece of ass . I never thought I 'd want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I know what you 're saying . It 's all in the genes , eh ? " " You think you can deliver at the price you quote ? " <p> " Absolutely . " <p> " Let me just run this past The Lone Ranger and see if we can move things along , good buddy . " <p> " Great . We look forward to working with you guys . So , hang in there , Tonto . " <p> " Yeah . Take care , kimosabe . " <p> Some weeks later , when triangulation occurred for a film called The Dead Soldier , Nestor went to a late show at a theater on the Upper Eastside . Late or not , the film was a must see , so a long line snaked to the box office . Nestor got one of the last available tickets and was thankful to find a seat . <p> Fortunately , the person sitting in front of him was of normal size and dimension with a head no bigger than a cantaloupe . In the dash for seats there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nestor had his coat off , The Dead Soldier was already rolling the names of its stars . <p> Chet Trigarian played the lead , which meant The Dead Soldier was an action picture in English . It was exactly the kind of film Nestor felt like seeing , a no-nonsense , no brain , pure and simple entertainment . Susan Acorn once remarked that she could see a resemblance between Nestor and the macho Trigarian so he studied the actor 's face with more than usual interest . <p> The first scene showed Trigarian as a flat-faced detective , stalking a small-time drug pusher through the hopeless streets of a gray city . As he closed on his prey , a gorgeous woman slammed a white Corvette around a comer . The car flattened the doomed hood , ripping into him with its bumper , then zoomed away like an angel with bloody lips . <p> Trigarian watched from the shadows with the expression of a man who has seen worse . But there was a glimmer of something like surprise . The cop knew who that woman was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had once been something between them . Nestor suspected a flashback . <p> The woman in front of him began coughing uncontrollably . She stood , grabbed for her coat , and ran for the door , trailing gurgling sounds . Then the theater was quiet again except for a ripple of slow jazz from the soundtrack . The camera closed on Trigarian 's dead eyes as , sure enough , his mind took him back to another time , another place where ... <p> Nestor could n't know to what time or place Trigarian was taken because he was distracted by a plodding figure moving down the carpeted aisle . The large shape dropped into the vacated seat with the thud of a suicide hitting pavement . <p> It was the same man who 'd thwarted Nestor 's full appreciation of Billy Eiffel . There was the avocado body , the swollen head and the tangled tendrils of hair pushing out from under that stupid cap . <p> Without even the consolation of Goobers , Nestor felt his rage crest , then curdle into a belly ache . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't concentrate on the words . Once Nestor could accept as an annoyance . Twice , considering the odds , the number of films in New York , the number of theaters , the number of seats , the number of hours and days - twice passed coincidence and verged on insult . <p> But , like the first time , there was nothing much Nestor could do . The screen had clearly announced that no standing room was permitted because of the fire code , and the place was jammed . <p> He lasted out the film , gluing sounds and sentences together like puzzle pieces , trying to fathom the plot . Trigarian had known the girl when both were young and vulnerable to dreams . They 'd been separated by circumstance ; he 'd gone to Vietnam and returned convinced he was really dead . The irony was , the girl had assumed his death and , after years of grieving , began a series of ugly relationships with men chosen to give her pain , and more pain . <p> Now she was the rich widow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was respectable by day but used her nights to snuff out evil wherever she saw it wearing pants . Bottom line , she was a serial killer and he was a cop , a serious , dedicated cop rigidly pledged to duty . <p> When the lights came up , Nestor rose to leave and was dumped backward by the gross obstacle who was already vertical and moving . Nestor was about to protest when he saw that the lump spotted a familiar face and rushed toward a woman who seemed glad to see him . They exchanged pecks on the cheek . Nestor heard her ask him what he thought of the film and he offered to tell her over coffee . <p> Nestor followed them to a luncheonette on the corner . They took the last unoccupied booth , but there was room at the counter . Nestor squatted on a stool , ordered a Sprite , and kept his ears open . He did n't have to strain . The man proclaimed his opinions . <p> " It was a perfect vehicle for Trigarian , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the fat face howled . " Accepting that Trigarian is an advertisement for terminal constipation . And the chutzpa , giving it a happy ending . Resurrection of the zombies . Come on . " <p> " You want to nit-pick , go ahead . But I believed the story and I certainly believed him . How could he have sent her away for life or a lethal injection . " <p> " So instead he sentences her to a life with him and a series of lethal injections . Please . I suppose it was clever enough . I mean , updating The Maltese Falcon for the age of enlightenment . " <p> " I see what you mean . You 're right , as usual . On the other hand , injection by Trigarian would n't be the worst punishment . " <p> " If the movie left you in heat , maybe we should wander up to your place , " the glob said loudly enough to turn heads . " If you 'd like . " <p> Nestor spilled his Sprite . The vision of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too much . He apologized to the waitress and helped blot his spill with a napkin . When Nestor looked up , the couple was already gone . <p> " I 'm glad I 'm not the poor bastard manning the Richter Scale tonight , " he said to the waitress who smiled and nodded . She could n't speak much English but she saw that he 'd left a dollar tip . Nestor thought of calling Susan Acom but remembered she was out of town for a recital . <p> " So you caught The Dead Soldier , " his boss said while they pissed side by side after a meeting . " Trigarian . I like that guy . He 's a walking dick . How 'd you like it ? " <p> " Interesting . Entertaining . I guess they were updating the Bogie flick , what was it , not Casablanca , The Maltese Falcon . " <p> " The one about the bird ? What has that got to do with this ? " <p> " Not much . Not really . Just riffing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he has to do by 1940 standards.Trigarian does n't turn the killer in , he turns her over . New family values . " <p> " You blame him , Nestor ? What should he do , let them cook her ? What a waste . I was n't in ' Nam but I knew guys with those fried egg eyes . Dead soldiers . I could see him thawing out . I could see him forgiving her . Considering . I loved that movie . Maybe you 're too damn critical for your own good . " <p> " Did I say I did n't like the movie ? I liked it , " Nestor said . <p> " We 've got to get down to the World Financial Center in a half-hour . You pissed enough . What have you got , diabetes ? " <p> " It was a good , solid movie , " Nestor said , zipping . " I 'd give it three stars . " <p> " That 's nice of you , " his boss said . " Who made you God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not until Nestor heard a flight attendant enthuse about Polly Valentine , a film Susan raved about when she got back to New York . Then he heard Polly Valentine 's director interviewed by Charlie Rose on PBS . " I think it 's the first animated film noir ever made , " the director said . " And I 'm not amazed that the intellectuals embraced it . Maybe a little amazed . Not a lot amazed . I was dealing with universal themes here and I know how much of vintage sweat I put into those frames . " <p> Nestor picked a theater far from his neighborhood for a Saturday matinee . The theater was crowded with ancients . A sign outside invited seniors in for only two dollars . <p> This time he sat in the front row , trading eye strain for vista . He ate his Goobers without even the pretense of struggle while he watched the overture of advertisements , a trivia quiz , and clips from next week 's bill . <p> His mind replayed the humiliating scene in the men 's room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's remarks about The Dead Soldier , smug barbs . Nestor had only himself to blame . He wondered why he had listened , much less repeated , comments by that horny tub of feces , that barrage balloon , that luncheonette lothario whose only purpose was to dilate a middle-aged vagina . <p> No question , the exchange with his boss , however innocent , had done him corporate harm . There is something about mutuality of movie taste , shared celluloid pleasure , that cements like nothing else . Conversely , opposition is implicit aggression and not easily forgiven . Nestor had shot himself in the leg but the wound would heal . It could take years . <p> Nestor dumped a dozen Goobers into his mouth and quickly knew something was very wrong . The Goobers tasted like chalk . He herded the residue in his mouth , careful not to swallow any more of the paste than he had . <p> The occupants of the first row were standing , brushing themselves , muttering curses . A snow of white plaster fell slowly from the high ceiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mist while patrons in other rows laughed . " The management is deeply sorry for this inconvenience . You 'll all be given a complimentary pass good for a future presentation . The thing is , workers are doing some repairs on our roof . It wo n't happen again . Please find alternative seats . Our feature is about to begin . " <p> Nestor spit the tainted clot of Goobers into his handkerchief and rolled it into a ball . " What happens if I get sick ? " he said to the usher . <p> " There 's an empty seat for you , sir . Three in on the left . " <p> " Not there , " Nestor said , " no , please , " but he was shushed by the impatient crowd around him . He already knew who would be entrenched in the seat in front of three in on the left . He did n't even bother to look . <p> For the first ten minutes of Polly Valentine Nestor kept his eyes shut and concentrated on what Goobers were left safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fleshy curtain that obliterated most of the screen . <p> Above , and on each side of that bulbous head , through those tufts of brillo hair , Nestor saw cheerful flashes of brilliant color even as he heard the soundtrack shriek . The director had been correct , the audience was entranced . <p> Polly Valentine was a farm girl from New Hampshire chosen as the annual virgin sacrifice offered to some unknown force during Summer Solstice . Ordinary citizens orchestrated her fate . The ceremony was a well-kept local secret , nothing for tourists to know about . There was a mansion outside the charming village with a history no one dared probe . The place reeked of unnatural death . And that was to be the place of Polly 's penetration . She was a curious mix of innocence and materialism , a willing co-conspirator , eager to confront whatever darkness lurked in that cursed house , convinced she could turn it to a profit . <p> Nestor ate his Goobers and thought about what the obstacle must be thinking . " Beauty And The Beast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetry in the special effects but it all adds up to a soggy comic book . Animated horror is like a Sophoclean Loony Toon . The antipathy of form and content ... " Nestor forced himself to stop speculating . Whatever Mallomar Man had to say on the subject was less than irrelevant and could only lead to more trouble . <p> " Ca n't you be more specific ? " Susan Acom asked later that night , looking up from her pillow . <p> " Do we have to talk about Polly now , darling ? " <p> " Well , yes , actually , Nestor , I 'd like to hear your opinion while it 's fresh in your mind . Either you liked Polly Valentine or you hated Polly Valentine . There 's no in-between with that kind of cinematic statement . " " Statement ? " <p> " He is a serious director . He did do Cigar and One No Trump . You saw those , did n't you ? " <p> " Of course I saw those . And Polly Valentine shows the same kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a departure . There was depth and maturity . What was your favorite scene ? " <p> " We 're making love , Susan . " <p> " And this is part of our love play . Remember the preliminaries ? What was your favorite single scene ? Mine was the symbolic decapitation . " <p> " Decapitation ? Yes , mine too ! " Susan took his face in her hands and kissed him . <p> " But I felt the horror was diluted by the animation and the animation was compromised by the horror . " <p> " That 's how you reacted , Nestor ? To Polly Valentine ? I do n't think you saw the movie with your eyes open . Or was it your heart ? I 'm honestly upset by all this . " <p> After that night , Nestor was certain that neither the film or the theater mattered , or the time or even triangulation . Whenever , wherever he chose to see a movie , that man would arrive in time to plug the space between himself and the silver screen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had broken up soon after their Poly confrontation . It was she who 'd first spoken of decapitation , however symbolic . <p> Nestor bought a wicker basket from a wrinkled Peruvian at a Soho street fair , and an officer 's sword from a Village antique shop that specialized in Teutonic souvenirs . At his local Korean vegetable market , he ordered a case of honeydews already so ripe they were marked down by fifty percent . <p> At home , he fashioned a makeshift mannequin from an old plaid shirt shaped around foam rubber slabs , stiff denims fortified with bubble wrap , and , for whimsy , a pair of Nikes filled out with wooden shoe trees . He rigged the body with a neck that was a gift from the city , a wide rubber tube he found on the street . The rubber was elastic enough to cup a honeydew like a clerical collar and hold it in place . <p> In the same whimsical spirit that made him use the shoe trees , he took a Magic Marker and drew a face on each honeydew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorbent cotton . <p> Nestor positioned two kitchen chairs , one behind the other , in front of his TV set . His floppy dummy was strapped into the front seat with worn-out belts he 'd marked for the Salvation Army but somehow saved . Then he slipped a video of Lawrence Of Arabia into his VCR and pressed Power and Play on the remote . <p> With his basket cleverly hidden inside a large plastic bag from Bed , Bath , and Beyond , and his truncated sword concealed in a black umbrella , he sat behind his honeydew Frankenstein and watched the movie . He even had Goobers , not the large , theatrical size , but a miniature ration from the candy store . <p> While Lawrence rode the desert sands , Nestor licked and chewed and thought about his predicament . For some reason , it did n't matter why , he was being movie deprived like one of those rotten little rebels forced to sit facing backwards in the Camp Barefoot recreation hall . <p> In most cases they deserved denial . But Nestor was certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no major sinner , he kept the social contract , give or take . He was only doing his best , trying to hold his own in the world and possibly reach some distant shore , swimming against a clutching undertow that sucked at him like he sucked chocolate . <p> Was he being paranoid ? The man who blocked his vision , not unlike fat blocks an artery to the heart , was no fantasy . The fat had to be reamed away or surgically bypassed . It was a matter of personal survival . There was a whole crop of major motion pictures on the horizon . <p> This creature who plagued him was guilty of the worst kind of sabotage . And who would miss that bundle of pus and negativism ? The man hated everything ; his acid eyes peered inside armpits and between toes . Depression and cynicism could erode even the strongest and most beautiful temple . <p> " Wait for pay cable or the rental store ? " Nestor answered the slumping dummy who had n't asked anything . " Put my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks . " <p> Nestor positioned his basket , slipped his sword from inside the umbrella , held his breath , and struck . The first rehearsal was a fiasco . The honeydew was slashed at midpoint , near the nose . Juice and seeds scattered in every direction . Green flesh fell into Nestor 's lap , missing the basket by at least an inch . <p> But Nestor got up , replaced the severed head with another , and tried again . Nestor had never been overly impulsive or impatient . He believed that he who learns slowly learns best . <p> For three months Nestor allowed himself to endure indignity . He saw American Rapture , Invaders of the Dream , and a remake of Romeo and Juliet without seeing much of anything except his nemesis ' rear . At night , he executed honeydews by the dozen . <p> Once , during Invaders , the man came with a companion , a boy , and Nestor verged on hysteria when he considered that the tumor might have metastasized and produced an offspring . But the boy had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could be even a distant relation defied every law of genetics . The whole picture long , and it was a long picture , Nestor heard a pontifical Mr. Wiseass chortle and whisper his put-downs . <p> The film was already nominated for ten awards and had grossed two hundred million . Nestor pitied the boy and was tempted to lean forward and plug those impressionable young ears with fresh Goobers . Instead , Nestor closed his own ears . He vowed not to repeat the error that already cost him Susan Acorn 's delicious embrace and nearly his job . <p> Nestor was n't much interested in those films anyhow . He was there to study , to calculate , plot and plan . He took notes in the dark , how the man shifted , how he held his head , how often he fidgeted , at what angle his head tilted forward , or to a side . Most important , Nestor tried to read the man 's body language , to anticipate when the head would tilt back . Gravity was Nestor 's best ally . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attack . His practice sessions at home were always successful . A quick swish of the sword and another surrogate skull would be neatly cut from its base and fall backward into the waiting basket ; towels at the bottom muffled sound and drank up excess juice . <p> Nestor browsed listings in the newspaper and chose his killing ground . The film he picked had not only triangulated , it seemed more than perfect . <p> Crescendo told the story of an obscure classical composer obsessed with the creation of a symphony powerful enough and loud enough to muffle the booming voices of enemy cannon destroying his beloved hamlet . A celebration of the human spirit , a testimony to courage and resolve ... As the music rises and crashes like a wave of outrage on a violated beach of resolve , one is totally immersed in a cathedral of cacophony and yet there is harmony and the redeeming trill of the lark . Nestor savored the reviews . " Loud is good , " he thought . " The louder the better . " Because even with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the firmest of melons , albeit hardly more than a sigh . <p> Nestor covered his tracks on the evening chosen for murder . Before he went out , he had Chinese food sent to his flat . He dismantled his mannequin and got rid of the final debris of bisected honeydews . He turned his TV to his favorite program with the volume high enough to be heard by his neighbors . He even phoned Susan Acom to ask how she 'd been , compare notes , and make the point of telling her how much he looked forward to spending an evening of lethargy and solitude . <p> Then he slid the sword into its umbrella sheath , perfectly reasonable since the evening 's prediction included a chance of showers , lined his wicker basket with a fresh turkish towel , hid it inside the Bed , Bath , and Beyond bag , and went quietly down the back staircase and out through the basement door . <p> It was both ironic and convenient that Crescendo was playing at the same local theater where he 'd first encountered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could be home in a matter of minutes . <p> This time , the theater was practically empty . Nestor chose a seat at random and waited for the lights to dim . He played his Goobers game , priming his taste buds with two , holding back the primal urge to gobble up the rest . That proved he was in cool control . <p> His victim arrived on schedule and plopped into his ordained seat just after Nestor caught a glimpse of Crescendo 's associated producers . As it happened , the reviews proved accurate . It was a loud movie , filled with screams , explosions and trumpets . The music vibrated through Nestor 's intestines . <p> He waited until the small audience was entirely hypnotized , caught in a shell of emotion . Then Nestor freed his sword and balanced the basket between his knees . <p> Just as he cocked his arm to strike the death blow , the man in front of him tumed . Nestor was eye-to-eye with a face that belonged to an errant moon from a distant planet . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glossed by jellied perspiration . The man leaned closer . <p> " You have Goobers .

" Nestor said , and swung his sword with magnificent efficiency . The fact that its target was so cooperative , leaning toward him , miraculously tilted downward , was a gift from the gods . <p> The man 's last expression , something between a plea and anticipation of taboo Goobers , clung to that continent of a face until the eyes rolled and faded to black . <p> Then the head fell neatly into Nestor 's basket.The deed was done .

He could n't imagine why the man complained or criticized such an uplifting story and memorable score . <p> His original plan was to dispose of the head in the Union Square BMT station but instead he took it home and put it in his freezer . The man was , after all , an encyclopedia of 20th Century cinema . He had probably seen everything there was to see . <p> Nestor knew and respected what he 'd read about cryogenics . It was entirely feasible that at some future date the head could be thawed and returned to ambience . With that possibility , what he 'd done to save himself , however justified , could hardly be called murder in the first degree . <p> And he might actually have the opportunity to ask the head what it was about Crescendo that bothered it enough to risk health , well being , and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to know that Goobers are addictive , that within minutes it would crave its own box and urge its body to make a trip to the theater 's refreshment stand . To do that might have risked missing a climactic scene , the very scene that could have completely altered opinion . <p> The head , turned to ice , took up important space in Nestor 's small refrigerator . It changed the way he shopped for frozen vegetables .
