Mrs. Cashman needed eighty-seven dollars and I was determined to help her get it . <p> " But you must n't give it to me , I wo n't take it , " Mrs. Cashman said , her oversized , pearl-like necklace clanking against the edge of her third refill of coffee in our hotel 's delicatessen . " You must n't . " Mrs. Cashman was seventy-three . She had n't touched the third cup , but she would , as it was free , and coffee , though she 'd never say this , killed the need for food . <p> " I do n't have it , " I said . Her gaze dropped from mine , into the coffee and the swirl of cream she 'd poured in , the coffee white , and she brought the cup to her lips . <p> " It 's not for me , " she sipped , " but for Mr. Newcomb . He 's eighty-four years old . " <p> Mr. Newcomb lived on the eleventh floor , two above mine , beside Mrs. Cashman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move , " to a lower floor on account of his legs , what with the elevators always busted ; or maybe straight to the funeral parlor , cut out the middle men . " The one time I 'd spoken with Mr. Newcomb , or rather he to me , he was sitting alone with a cigar in the Carlson 's lobby , staring into the wallpaper . He 'd startled me , turning and meeting my eyes . " Cubano , " is all he 'd said . And then he 'd smiled and turned his attention back to the wall . <p> " Let 's get more crackers , " I suggested , though my tooth was killing me , the tooth I later had pulled , just to the right of the right incisor , and as I was signaling the waitress , Mrs. Cashman covered my free hand with her own . <p> " He 's not well . It 's his joints . They ache beyond normal , " she said , and , as if to demonstrate , she pulled up the hem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set her coughing and I checked my pocket for change to see if I had enough to buy her a soup . <p> " I 'll buy you a soup , " I said as the waitress arrived . <p> Mrs. Cashman looked up from her knees . " Not too much salt . " Her coughing ceased . " And maybe some extra noodle . " <p> I 'd moved into the Carlson , after my breakup with Lacey , to be with my father , who would die six months after my arrival , though only in my mind did the two events go together . I 'd stayed on-living in his front room , on the sofa , not in his bed-where the rent was controlled and my mother 's picture watched over me from the foyer wall . I did n't have anywhere else to go . My jobs were n't working out : first the desk job with the environmental clean-up company , then the retail job with the suit I never earned enough to pay for , that at least I wore to his funeral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the handicapped . I 'm not handicapped , impaired , challenged , no more than anyone else , not counting my tooth , but these companies hire out to fill the needs around the holidays , and it was November and the Christmas rush was on . <p> I have no siblings . I am an only child . My mother died when I was ten . I sat in the oak tree in front of the junior high school the day of her death , and watched the students on the playground , and then when it was dark I climbed down and went back to our house , where my father was watching the news , and when I came in he smiled thickly at me , his lips gone dry and the lines around his eyes deep in the light of the television , and he clapped his hands once as if for encouragement . <p> It had seemed natural to stay on in his apartment , though now that he had been gone , dead , for two and a half months , I was beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The apartment had only two rooms , and they were not separated by a wall , only by a change in carpet , from orange ( in the bedroom ) to brown ( in the living room ) , and above the two TVs he 'd mounted what a client from Augusta , Maine , had sent in a crate with the payment that closed out the client 's account of twenty-two years . <p> My father had two televisions , one for picture and one for sound . Near the end , when he was thin and suddenly old , we 'd sit eating something I 'd brought home , and I 'd have the unsettling experience of watching one newscaster while listening to another . The sound up so loud that it distorted , my father never seeming to mind . More recently , the picture tube had begun to go , so I 'd hear most programs but see very few . Mrs. Cashman came over sometimes after he 'd died , and we 'd sit in the glow of the television , and she 'd tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her grandchildren , a game show on one of the TVs , the other screen blank , the moose up above it all like a big antenna . <p> My father and Mrs. Cashman did not speak . <p> " She 's a woman you ca n't get to know , " he once said , though I never had any trouble and it would not be until after his death , after I 'd had my day with Mr. Newcomb , that I would understand that what he 'd said was so , though not in the ways that he meant . <p> Sometimes I brought Mrs. Cashman food and she would cook it . Lacey never cooked . In fact , though we were married , I now do n't know what I saw in her . " She had a nice chest , " my father would say , polishing to his last good day the sample case he keptinside , the wallets and the key cases , the purses , the letter openers with the leather handles-and also the unsold attaches . " A nice chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest , but this did not seem a legitimate basis for matrimony . <p> " And she had personality . " <p> " Personality ? Dad , she left me . She packed up and left me and took our son . " <p> " Still , " my father said , and turned his attention to the noise from the upper TV . I must have turned my attention to the window , for it was there that I first saw Mrs. Cashman . <p> Mrs. Cashman , I 'd learn from our lunches , left Poland in the back of a mailsack when she was fifteen . She married Mr. Cashman in Toronto and , when he 'd died , she 'd found a place with her younger sister , Nora , who 'd retired to the Carlson in the late I970s with a pension from AT &T.; <p> I first saw Mrs. Cashman surrounded by fur from a rug she was shaking out her eleventh-story window . The effect was startling : the red rug flapping like a tongue , white fur rising around her , my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV . After a particularly vigorous shake , the rug dropped from her hands and for a minute it appeared Mrs. Cashman might float down behind it . She lunged after the rug , her fingers snapping in the air , as if calling it back , and then a small dog appeared in the sill beside her , barked twice , and bit onto her dress . She smacked it . <p> The red rug caught a breeze and sailed over the four lanes of Eddy Street . <p> I retrieved it . I retrieved the rug and I brought it back to her , maybe because I 'm a sucker , or more likely because the look on her face after she 'd dropped it reminded me of Crawford 's the time I ran over his tricycle with Lacey 's Cabriolet . <p> Crawford , my son , was three when they left . We had almost aborted him , but at the last minute Lacey could not go through with it , and now I am of course thankful to her , though she cheated on me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know anymore for certain how Crawford was . <p> I did n't see Mrs. Cashman again until I bumped into her in the laundry where I was washing my father 's clothes . <p> " Spray bleach , " she 'd said without prompting , and when I turned from my sorting , colors from whites , she was staring at me , two oyster-sized earrings on either side of her loosely swaying neck . " For the shorts . " <p> I 'm not one to speak much of personal issues of hygiene . Lacey once said to me , in bed , " I stink , I know , I do n't use deodorant , " but that was different , as we were of course without clothes , and besides her smell to me was like a damned nectar ; but Mrs. Cashman was squeaking toward me , in the building 's basement laundry , her feet in blue tennis shoes . <p> " You spray the front and the back and , if you 're a sweaty man , you spray the waist as well . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if it were the weather or maybe that I 'd dropped a sock behind the washer . <p> She snatched my father 's boxers before I even saw her arm move . She turned the shorts in her hand , &owning.; " What 's the matter ? You not got a wife ? " <p> " We 've separated . " <p> " Big shot , " she said . <p> " She left me . " <p> She paused . " Spray bleach , " she finally said . " Front and the back . " <p> My father often surprised me , with his televisions , with his moosehead , even with the announcement that he was dying . He 'd known about the cancer for six months before he called , and then he 'd only spoken to Lacey , who 'd taped a note to the refrigerator saying that he 'd phoned . <p> One night , my father , after a particularly upsetting viewing of the eleven o'clock news , surprised me by sending me up to check on Mrs. Cashman 's sister . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Nora ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Mrs. Cashman 's sister ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Why do n't you just call her ? " <p> " She worked forty years at AT &T.; She 's had enough already with the telephone . " <p> I did as he asked . Nora answered the door as if it were perfectly normal for me to be calling at half past eleven , smiling as if she were glad to see me , squeezing my arm in gratitude when I asked her how she was . <p> It was n't until after my father 's death that I started to see more of Mrs. Cashman . My job at the handicapped phone bank freed up my days , and so I 'd often see her at breakfast or at lunch in the hotel 's delicatessen where she 'd call me to her table . With Crawford gone and Lacey gone and my father gone , I did not mind the company . There were long periods of silence , with Mrs. Cashman maybe eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her life in Canada , about growing up in Toronto with an uncle and aunt , about her husband who , like her father , had been a jeweler , and I 'd compliment the jewels she wore and she 'd tell me how they were only fakes , but she 'd blush . I liked that she 'd blush . At seventy-three years old . She was graceful . She wore a hat , for instance , whenever she went out of her apartment . And she 'd always motion for me to sit with her , there in the lobby delicatessen , extending a thin arm to the empty chair , her bracelets sweeping toward it . And Mr. Newcomb , the time I 'd seen him sitting in the Carlson lobby , just sitting there with his cigar , he wore a necktie . Even my father never left in the morning without shaving twice . <p> I started to bring her vitamins . I was stealing them , true , but the phone job paid under the minimum wage , and I could not afford them otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I could not bring myself to lie . I 'd sold only twelve orders in four weeks , and I knew my vitamin days were numbered . <p> Once I smuggled her out a light bulb . <p> " What 's this ? " <p> " A light bulb . " <p> " Why ? " <p> " It lasts a lifetime . " <p> " With me , then , you got ripped off . " <p> The vitamins she accepted , though she said they burned her stomach . " Take them with food , " I told her . <p> " They turn my pee extra yellow . " <p> " Spray bleach , " I said . <p> Lacey was a health nut . I hated to think that I 'd been attracted to the vitamin angle of the handicapped job for this reason , but it is true that my vitamin sales outnumbered my bulb sales by nearly four to one , though as I say they were far from providing a steady salary . Lacey went off with the guy who sold me life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though I would n't like it , always fencing people 's insecurities . She did aerobics , sometimes twice a day , and some nights she 'd go out with her friends from the gym after the dinnertime workout and I realize now that she was probably then with Edward . <p> There 'd be something in the freezer or the fridge . I 'd sit with Crawford in our small yard , and to see over our fence , and the fences that made boxes of all the yards , we 'd climb the near branch of our oak , and watch the sun drop down behind the old athletic park and the fireflies rise up from the grass . <p> I could guess where Lacey had taken him : to her parents , or to Edward 's house , and I knew the number of Edward 's office as I mailed a check there every month , but I figured I 'd wait and let Lacey call , that Crawford would need time to adjust , that he did n't need a scene right then , with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new man with whom he 'd have to learn to get along . <p> Because she rarely had much to eat , once I bought Mrs. Cashman a fish . A whole fish that was maybe two days old but I 'd been assured was fresh enough . My father had left five hundred and sixty-four dollars worth of silver dollars-nine coins-in a ladies ' handbag that was fastened with a three-number combination lock . After paying rent and back rent , I had nineteen dollars left . <p> " It 's a celebration , " Mrs. Cashman announced when I arrived at her apartment with the fish . <p> We sat at Mrs. Cashman 's card table and ate the fish she 'd broiled . During the entire meal her schnauzer , Alfred , was humping my leg . Whenever I was in the house he lunged toward me with the heat of a pervert . Though small , he was fat , as Mrs. Cashman and Mr. Newcomb often left their apartments ' adjoining door ajar , and , as Mrs. Cashman put it , Mr. Newcomb " was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newcomb 's door after inviting Nora to dinner , but there had been no answer . <p> " He rests , " said Mrs. Cashman . <p> " He dances , " said Nora , and I thought for a moment she was referring to Mr. Newcomb until I saw that she was pointing at Alfred doing a kind of dance on my poor leg . <p> " About the eighty-eight dollars , " Mrs. Cashman said as she spooned a broth across my fish . In it were bits of green and flakes of black and it looked nice . " Maybe your father left you a little money ? " <p> " Lilka ! " Nora was sixty-six . The sister born between the two of them had , like the parents , as Mrs. Cashman once briefly put it to me , not survived . <p> " He left me a handbag full of silver dollars , " I said . <p> " Maybe you can cash them ? " <p> " Your father was a nice man , Mr. Nye , " said Nora . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighed , settled down on the red rug . Mrs. Cashman re-smoothed the napkin in her lap . Nora began to talk about a new man in her life . <p> " He 's a painter . " <p> Mrs. Cashman speared a bean . " Houses ? " <p> Nora &owned.; " What about you , Neil ? " <p> " There 's no new man in my life , " I said , thinking Mrs. Cashman might get a kick out of this but she just frowned , and so now they were both &owning.; My tooth was killing me , but I took another bite , packing the left side of my mouth . <p> " So , Nora , " said Mrs. Cashman , " this man ? " <p> " He 's divorcing . " <p> " He 's a painter and he 's divorcing ? What next , that he 's purple ? " <p> " He 's a very nice man , " Nora said . She flipped Albert a red potato . " And what about your oldest ? " <p> Mrs. Cashman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's worried that Julie will take everything . He sent thirty dollars . " <p> Nora spoke down to her plate . " Thirty dollars . " <p> " He 's doing the best that he can . I told him never to marry that . . . that girl . " Mrs. Cashman shook a little , shut her eyes . When she opened them , she was looking at me . " I 'd give it to Mr. Newcomb if I did n't have to pay rent . The poor man 's legs . " <p> " And where are his children ? " Nora asked . <p> " Oh , Nora , where are any of our children ? " <p> I excused myself from the table . Alfred jumped into my chair , and Mrs. Cashman swatted at him but not before he grabbed what he could . He 'd choke on a bone and I 'd have to take him to the vet and I did n't even have the money to loan to Mrs. Cashman for Mr. Newcomb 's weak legs . <p> Crawford had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been bad for a while , not at the start , when I had my father to watch over , but lately nothing had been staying in me . I sat on the toilet in Mrs. Cashman 's bathroom , and stared into the mirror that was across from me . <p> I 'd hit Crawford once . He 'd run out into the road and an ice-cream truck nearly took him , or at least had to brake , its horn blaring , the clown on top spinning , and I overreacted because when I got to Crawford I cuffed him and even though I felt so bad that I bought him two creamsickles I could n't help feel that this was something he might still think about , maybe at night , alone in a bed that was not yet his own . <p> Nora was whispering when I emerged . <p> " His own son , " she was saying . <p> " His only son . " <p> I went through the opened door across from the bathroom and was in Mr. Newcomb 's den . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his frail legs , to get his butt over here and tell me why I should give him eighty-eight dollars when I was broke , too . And I was going to tell him , crossing the den , until I pushed open the den 's other door and saw Mr. Newcomb spread out in his bed . An old duvet across him , his body barely a wrinkle in the fabric , he could not have weighed one hundred pounds . And beside his bed a sandwich , a small bite mark in the half that was left , hardening , and an untouched glass of milk . <p> Stealing the money was not hard . Rather than spend what would be my last shift on the telephone , I moved from station to station talking . The supervisors I worked with were never eager to see me , and they would turn to the phone after a couple of words and then I would just grab their banks . Between three banks , I collected fifty-one dollars in cash . I left whatever checks there were in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and just kept walking . I did not feel badly that I was stealing from the handicapped , as I was giving to the handicapped , cutting out the middle man . <p> I phoned Mrs. Cashman before I went to her room and knocked . She had n't been in the delicatessen , where I 'd treated myself to a coffee with the money I had stolen . I felt a little bad doing so , but I was thirty-six dollars short as it was , so I did not feel that seventy-five cents , a dollar with the tip , would affect Mr. Newcomb 's legs one way or the other . <p> I knocked on her door a few more times but she did not answer . I thought about coming upstairs again later , but I did not really feel like going back to my father 's apartment . I knocked on Mr. Newcomb 's door . I knocked loudly and then louder still . I had the money he needed . He would be happy that I woke him . <p> " Who is it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " It 's Neil , " I said . " From downstairs . " <p> " Hold on , hold on , " Mr. Newcomb said , his voice coming from across the apartment . " I 'll be a minute . " <p> When the door finally opened , it opened only a crack , and I saw Mr. Newcomb , a cane in his hand , his body wrapped in a robe . " Yes ? " <p> " I have your money . " <p> " One hundred four dollars ? " <p> " Fifty-one . Fifty , actually . " <p> " You got a car ? " <p> " Huh ? " <p> Mr. Newcomb seemed to look back over his shoulder . " Go downstairs and get me a newspaper , will you ? Will you do that , Neil ? " <p> " Sure . " <p> " Thanks , Neil . Thanks very much , " Mr. Newcomb said , and as I tried to look over his shoulder , he quickly shut the door . <p> He had dressed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a green Vneck sweater over a cream-colored shirt , and every inch , if baggy , was pressed . His hair was wet and combed and he moved , for a man with bum legs , well enough to take the paper from me , take my arm , motion for me to sit , and get himself into the chair beneath the picture of his wife and a photo from the War . <p> I was looking at the photo , trying to figure which of the five young soldiers that leaned on a donkey cart was now this old man thumbing through the newspaper , his cane against the cushion of the chair , when Mrs. Cashman appeared in the connecting doorway wearing her red hat . <p> " Hello , Neil . " <p> " Hello , Mrs. Cashman . Are you just getting in ? " <p> " No , " she said . " Did you knock ? I must have been napping- " <p> " Are you going out ? " I asked . <p> " No , dear- " <p> She smiled at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she closed the doors that adjoined the two apartments , her red hat the last thing to go . <p> Mr. Newcomb had the paper in pieces around his chair , was tearing one page in half . " Golden Day , " he said . I looked at him , at his face that I 'd seen as so frail , and it did not seem now that way at all , but rather seemed taken over by his eyes , which all but jumped from their sockets . <p> " I 'm sorry that I 'm a little short with the money , " I began , but he cut me off . He was trying to stand . I got to my own feet and offered him my arm . <p> " Good , " he said . " Good . You got a car ? " <p> " No . " <p> " That 's OK . Twenty-two times two is forty-four , that leaves six dollars . What 's twenty-two times one and a half ? " <p> " Thirty-six , " he continued before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's OK " He was up now , with his hand on his black wooden cane , and he was heading toward the closet . <p> " Go into my kitchen , in the cabinet beside the sink . " <p> The kitchen was clean , and as small as my father 's , and when I opened the cabinet beside the sink it was empty . I opened the cabinet opposite . Inside were two cans of mini-ravioli , a can of soup , a tin of tuna , and one box of Ritz crackers . <p> " Never mind , " Mr. Newcomb called . " I 've got it here . " <p> I looked in the cupboard for a minute longer , and then turned to see Mr. Newcomb emerging from the bedroom with two glasses and a bottle of Canadian whiskey . He was holding them in the hand that did n't hold his cane and I rushed to him to make sure he did not drop them . <p> " Fill ' em , " Newcomb said . <p> I poured . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I poured about an inch into each tumbler , tumblers that were already wet . <p> " Pretty thin fingers , " Mr. Newcomb said , and then he raised his glass and drank it back and I did the same . " To Golden Day , " he said and he smacked his lips . <p> I thought maybe the Golden Day was a hospital , or a prescription drug , or God forbid it sounded like the place that buried my father . " Yes , it is a golden day , " I said , " and I 'm glad I could be of help . " <p> Mr. Newcomb was fitting onto his head a green fedora with a red feather in the band . " Let 's blow out of here , " he said , and we left the Carlson , and twenty minutes later we were on the number 7 bus to the track . <p> At six to one , Golden Day figured to pay $2I6 on our thirty-six-dollar bet . After bus fare and the dollar admission , we were able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the concrete fairway beneath the grandstand , Mr. Newcomb talked horses nonstop : see the way that one leans , see the way that one carries , that one has rot , that one 's ribs are heavy . He had a comment for each horse that paraded past . And then it was the third race , and out came Golden Day . <p> I had n't planned on becoming involved in what I perceived to be an old man 's last cry at life , and I was a little uncomfortable about his health , but he 'd seemed so eager , this seemed so important to him , that I went along , without questioning . And Golden Day was a magnificent horse : her mane lit with the sun , her head held higher than the horses around her . I 'd give the old man his thrill , put him back on the bus-I 'd been smart enough to buy round-trip passes-then get him back to bed before his legs gave out completely . When he slept he might dream of his younger days , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , as the two of us watched Golden Day bank back toward the starting gate , to hear Mr. Newcomb say , " So , your wife left you ? " <p> I took my eyes from the horse . " I beg your pardon ? " <p> " Your wife ? She up and left with your own son , Mrs. Cashman says . " <p> " That 's private . Mrs. Cashman was supposed to keep that to herself . " <p> " People talk , " Mr. Newcomb said , and then he elbowed me hard in the ribs and jutted his narrow chin back toward the track . " Here we go-Golden Day ! " <p> The gun fired , the gate-which was hooked to the back of a truck-sped off , and Golden Day immediately took advantage of her position on the rail . Like lightning she bolted off . <p> " Golden Day ! " I said . <p> " You must miss him , " said Mr. Newcomb . <p> I looked down at the little man , whose right arm was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knob at the top of his cane . Then the elbow again , and Newcomb was pointing toward the track . <p> " Look at her take that turn . Golden Day , Golden Day , Golden Day at six to one ! " <p> She was in the lead . The number-three horse was closing . The number-eight horse , a giant animal that looked prehistoric , was muscling in from the outside . You could see the mad flair of its nostrils , the hatred in it of losing . " She 's got to hold the rail , " I said , " come on Golden Day , come on golden girl ! " <p> " You were cheating , maybe ? " I felt Mr. Newcomb 's face near mine once more . <p> " No . " <p> " You do n't like girls ? " <p> " Of course I like girls . " <p> Mr. Newcomb shrugged his frail shoulders . The feather in his hat blew a little in the wind . <p> " Here , here , " he said , suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's a closer . " <p> " What about the number-eight horse ? " That horse 's nose was at her tail , and he seemed to be pressing in . <p> " It 's going to be close , " Mr. Newcomb said and we inched up toward the rail . The announcer was calling faster now , the race heating up and while the crowd was sparse , a roar began from the grandstand . <p> Golden Day by half a length , Lightning Strike closing , Golden Day into the turn , fast finisher , dry track , Golden Day , Golden Day , Golden Day <p> " Come on , Golden Day , " I shouted , " Come on , COME ON , COME ON- " <p> The horses were streaking toward us , the finish line twenty feet to my right . We were at the fence before the rail , ten feet from the horses , I could smell them , I could feel their approaching heat <p> Lightning Strike-Golden Day-Lightning Strike-Golden Day <p> A dead heat , neck and neck , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces clamped to the streaking necks <p> " GOLDEN DAY , GOLDEN DAY , GOLDEN DAY , " I was screaming and Mr. Newcomb was pounding at the fence , his teeth gritted together <p> " GO-GO-GO-GO-GO- " he cried , " GOLDEN DAY ! " <p> And they streaked past , the two horses identical , stretching out , every last inch toward the finish line . The crowd 's roar , the blur of the announcer 's mad call , Mr. Newcomb with his arms raised up over his head <p> And then I realized I was crying , big tears down my dumb face , and when I turned toward Mr. Newcomb he was watching me , the horses crossing the finish line , the crowd 's roaring blanket , his arms opening wide to me , the sunlight across his face . <p>
