CRAZY MARIE <p> Love will always find you no matter where you hide . <p>  --  D.S. <p> She had never been married or even engaged . It had never occurred to her . You might say she could n't associate herself with engagement rings or marriage . She was one of those people who tend to be rejected . Maybe because she never said very much and was n't particularly entertaining  --  in any case , she thought of herself as boring  --  but especially because she did n't demand anything of others . She never insisted that they keep their appointments . She hardly even expected it , but took things as they came . She kept the food warm for two hours . That was a kind of limit she had set . Then she would put her napkin in her lap and start to eat , looking at the empty plate across the table . She did n't bother to clear it away . It would stay there until she took her own . She was n't sentimental about herself . <p> Besides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared food at the supermarket . Pea soup , spaghetti in meat sauce , ravioli in cans . She could tell it had a metallic taste of preservatives and chemicals . There was n't anything wrong with her taste buds . But she was a creature of habit , and when she got in the habit of buying certain things , she kept right on buying them . Not out of apathy but rather from a complete lack of interest in material things . <p> She was a very nervous person . You could see this when , on rare occasions , she talked about herself . Then she would get red blotches on her cheeks and neck . And she always held her hand in front of her mouth when she talked , as if she wanted to catch the words with her hand before they came out too far and hit somebody . She had difficulty getting even the most trivial things about herself  --  what school she had attended , how old she was , or whether she liked music  --  past her lips . Her lips were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been fastened to the pale , rather indistinct , moon-shaped face that seemed to float above her body . She was thin to the point of looking malnourished . You could see the contours of her skeleton beneath her skin . Her upper arms were as thin as pipe cleaners , and her thighs were skinny and bowed . She wore underwear that would fit a ten-year-old . <p> Her lack of interest in material things was also evidenced in her apartment . The furniture was placed around the room in a random , impractical manner ; most of it came from her childhood bedroom and her parents ' attic . The chairs were too low in proportion to the table , and the lamps were hung too high and placed where there was no need for them . It was cold in the apartment too . She always left the top window open . There was a draft along the floor , and there were gaps at the bottom of the baseboards . And the floorboards lay barely within shouting distance of each other . The worst gaps were covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much heat and turned the radiator on only when guests came . <p> For late evening visits , she set the same two-hour waiting limit as she did for the dinner visits . Then she would slide the security lock on the door , unplug the phone , and go to bed . She would pass the time while she waited by watching television or reading a book from the library . But she preferred television , and every once in a while there was an interesting program from a foreign country that she thought she learned something from . There may be people tempted to think that Marie was some sort of call girl because of her different gentlemen callers and the way things happened . But that was n't the case . On the contrary , she was probably the one  --  if we want to calculate it in terms of money  --  who bore the lion 's share of the expenses associated with the dates she had . And in a way , that was how she preferred it . She found it easier to give than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a restaurant , she said No thank you . She did n't like to sit and eat among strangers . When she made a new acquaintance and he suggested that they go to his place , she would insist that they do it at her apartment or forget the whole thing . She felt most comfortable in her own home , and it was almost impossible to drag her anywhere else . <p> Marie worked at the laundromat on the corner of H. C. Orstedsvej and Rosenornsalle . Most of the customers came there to do their own laundry , and she did n't have anything to do with them except when there was a problem with the machines . She waited only on those customers who came to drop off their clothes and pick them up the next day . Once a day , she emptied the coin-operated washing machines , counted the coins , and took them over to the bank to deposit them into the owner 's account . She kept the laundromat 's books in a little back room that was crammed with laundry bags and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of everything  --  even the cleaning , which she was very meticulous about . She liked her job . She liked doing the same things every day . The routine itself gave her a certain satisfaction . And she could organize her day as she wanted . Only the things that needed to be done got done . She was comfortable with the machines and had learned to make minor repairs . If there were more serious problems , she would call the factory 's repair and service department , and they would send someone out right away . <p> The owner , who had fifteen or twenty laundromats in town  --  in addition to a lot of apartment buildings  --  came by every other month . But she never knew when . And when she saw the black Mercedes roll up in front of the large windows , her blood ran hot and cold . The owner walked around and inspected all the machines to see whether they were in proper working order , whether the floors were clean , whether the soap dispenser and change machine were polished , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literally everywhere . After he had made his rounds , he went into the back room where Marie sat quiet as a mouse . He asked if there were any problems . She shook her head . He nodded in parting . told her to contact him with any problems . So far there had n't been any . <p> Marie was virtually tied to the laundromat . Besides waiting on customers from nine o'clock to five-thirty , she had to go down to lock up the laundromat at ten o'clock every night and open it at seven o'clock every morning . It was n't part of her original duties , but it had been offered to her as an extra job . She lived on H. C. Orstedsvej in a high-ceilinged groundfloor apartment only a few steps from the laundromat . So getting up a little earlier in the morning or going down at night to shut off the lights and lock up did n't matter at all , since she was usually sitting around doing nothing anyway . <p> On evenings when she and a visitor were already in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her  --  first , lying awake keeping track of the time , and then getting up , pulling some clothes on , to go down to the laundromat , then back up again , getting undressed and into bed with a virtual stranger . On the other hand , she never had visitors more than once a week , or twice at most . And she could n't arrange her life around that . <p> Of course , she was doing it for the money too . She did n't really need the money , and she did n't include the amount she made on the side in her budget , but put it into the bank . She had no idea what she should use these savings for . She had enough furniture and china and curtains and clothes . She did n't need anything . " Well , yes , I need a child . " she thought . " So I 'm saving up for a child , " she told herself , smiling inwardly . She often talked to herself while she was washing and cleaning up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself , but she also talked with people she was thinking about , people she had seen on television or met on the street . She carried on long conversations in her head . Some days she found it hard to stop and would talk until the moment she fell asleep at night . About everything imaginable , from politics to headaches , war and menstruation , the Milky Way and space travel , about life and death , little people and important people-like herself and the owner in his black Mercedes . <p> Sometimes it got to be too much ; it was as if she were the center of the world and the whole universe revolved around her . The voices became radio waves and the people distant planets . When she got that way , she would go over to the supermarket and buy a bottle of beer . She would lock herself in the back room and gulp it down . She did n't even like alcohol . But it dulled the mind . She did n't need any stimulants , quite the contrary . When she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corduroy pants and clogs , no one could tell by looking at her that she was in a state of high excitement , a kind of expectation or preparation , that made it necessary for her to live as quietly and monotonously as she did . <p> Every Friday she bought flowers for the weekend . The florist 's shop was right next door to the laundromat and was owned by a young man with sunbleached hair who wore overalls . There was something gentle and nice about him . He wore a hand-knited vest , and his mother helped him make bouquets . The mother kept to the back room and did n't set foot in the store . But Marie caught glimpses of her in the doorway as she walked back and forth , puffing on a stogie . She was short , slender , and wiry . On the table , in among the soil , green branches , cacti , and flower blossoms , was a white ceramic mug of black coffee from which she took an occasional drink . <p> Marie considered the florist , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know his first name . And they chatted only about flowers  --  how long they lasted , how to care for them , about clay pots versus plastic pots , the weather and the seasons , which of course had a lot to do with flowers and definitely had an effect on prices . For the most part , Marie bought tulips , but never the same color two weeks running . Occasionally she would buy a potted plant , but it usually died on her , even though she would water it conscientiously every other day . <p> Beyond the florist , Marie found her circle of acquaintances mainly from among the laundromat 's customers . But one day in August , just after she had come back from her usual summer vacation on Majorca , two of the washing machines broke down . It all happened within the space of a few minutes . And the previous evening there had been problems with a dryer . She called the factory , and half an hour later a repairman arrived . Marie showed him which machines to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his appearance except that he was well-tanned  --  as if he had been to Majorca too  --  and had stars tattooed between the knuckles of his right hand . The repairs took almost two hours . When the repairman was finished , he came back to get a receipt from Marie . She signed the bill , but he continued to stand there as if he were waiting for something . Marie let him wait . She was counting the one- and five-kroner pieces . <p> " Are n't you going to offer me a cup of coffee ? " he said . Marie looked up at him in confusion . She had never been in this situation before . But she took the immersion heater down from the shelf and placed her cup on the table . She had only the one cup . It was from her own set , " Blue Edge . " There was only one chair too , so he stood , leaning up against the side of the table . He looked her over carefully . Then he said Good-bye , thanked her for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he came back to drop off his laundry . Marie took it and weighed it , acting as if nothing had happened , as if they had never seen each other before . The repairman tried to catch her eye . She avoided looking at him . <p> " I guess there has n't been any other trouble with the machines , " he said . There was something about him that gave her a feeling of beauty . <p> " No , " said Marie . <p> He took a pack of cigarettes out of his pocket and offered her one . She shook her head . <p> He said , " I really should pay you back for the coffee . How about having a beer with me ? " <p> " No thank you . " <p> " You sure do n't want very much . " <p> Marie did n't answer . She stood and waited for him to leave so she could go on with her work . <p> " I 'll come tomorrow to pick up my clothes , " he said and turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marie was very busy . And that evening she was having a visitor . She went shopping . Coffee and marzipan cake . Red wine and a package of mashed potatoes and a can of goulash . <p> She had everything ready , the food was on the table , when the doorbell rang . The visitor was a short , fat widower in his fifties . He had had his laundry done at the laundromat since long before Marie was hired . He was awkward and self-conscious and ate noisily , rattling everything . Marie poured out red wine and drank half a glass herself . Gradually , after the little man emptied the bottle , he grew more animated without losing his gentle manner . As a rule , he left before midnight . Marie never allowed her lovers to stay overnight . She did n't want to wake up with them in the morning . <p> It was rare that the widower initiated anything that resembled sex . But sometimes  --  when he was helping her clear the table or make coffee  --  they did happen to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost fall over each other . Then they would stand in the same position for a long time like a complex sculpture . Until Marie reached out her arm and turned off the gas and led him into the bedroom , where there was just enough space for her hard , narrow bed , a chair , and a chest of drawers . They got undressed with their backs to each other and crawled under the covers . For the most part , nothing more happened other than that they would lie there for an hour or so warming each other . He was impotent and always asked politely if she wanted him to satisfy her with his hands . But she did n't always feel like it . Then he would turn over onto his back and look up at the ceiling . The room was narrow , with a high ceiling , and the walls were a nougat-brown . When the door was shut , it was like lying in a huge cardboard box . <p> " Oh , to be young , " the widower sighed . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Handels Bank and lived alone in an apartment that was much too large . He was still mourning his wife and could n't bring himself to marry again , but once in a while he felt the need to be close to another person . He had chosen Marie for that . He talked a lot about his wife , how beautiful she had been , a splendid mother , accomplished , competent . And after that about his youth in Lemvig and the fishing trips on the fjord . Marie listened to the same stories over and over again . She saw all of it as clear as life before her and felt almost as though she knew him better than she knew herself . She felt secure with him because it did n't bother him if she did n't say anything . <p> He had a hobby , or rather a passion : old coins . Over the years , he had managed to put together a collection that was worth a small fortune . Every evening , he sat at his desk and looked at them through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sniffing at them . Recently , however , eczema had begun to appear on his hands , and the doctor thought it was from the coins . So he put on gloves every time he sat studying his collection . But it did n't help . The eczema did n't go away . His hands were <p> flaming red and itched unbearably , especially when he was nervous and perspired . Then he would scratch at the thin skin between his fingers until it bled . And at night he kept the gloves on so he would n't rub the ointment off onto the bedclothes . He thought the condition extremely embarrassing for a man with his job , which required nice hands . When he counted out money and pushed it under the glass window to someone , the customer 's eyes were always on his hands . Customers did n't see his face . <p> Eventually , it got so bad that the widower was transferred from the cashier 's window to a desk at the farthest end of the bank 's large office . It was a terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't ashamed to confide in about the whole thing . <p> " I 've put my coin collection away . I do n't touch it anymore , and I still ca n't get rid of this damn stuff , " he complained , touching his chin . <p> " Do n't you think that it might be the money in the bank you ca n't tolerate , rather than the old coins ? " <p> " Then my whole existence would be threatened ! " he cried hysterically . <p> " But it has n't gotten better with the ointment ? " <p> " No , it 's getting worse and worse . I 'll end up having to give in and go to a healer , even though it 's against my principles . " <p> That evening , he was very depressed . They were still eating dinner . He kept rubbing his hands together in despair . <p> " To think that this should happen to me . It 's not fair . I have n't done anything . I 've lived a decent , proper life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , " Marie said with a slightly sharper tone of voice than usual . " But you do n't think about that until the unfairness hits you . " <p> The little banker sighed again , and Marie wanted to get up and go out and make coffee . <p> " You should n't go to any trouble . I 'll be leaving soon . I 'm not worth much this evening . You just ca n't imagine what it means in my position to have a visible defect like this . I 'd rather be castrated . At least no one can see that . Come over here and sit down for a while . " <p> Marie sat down beside him . He stroked her hair and kissed her shyly on the neck . She was rather tall , and she literally towered over him . She looked over his bald head and out the window . Rain was coming down . When the weather was bad , she would start to think about how lucky she was to have a place to live , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in stairwells in the cold wind . In the winter , when the snow and true cold set in , she actually felt privileged . <p> He kept stroking her hair , mechanically and absentmindedly . He breathed heavily . <p> " The interest rate has gone up again . But what good does it do when we continue to live beyond our means , and our foreign debt grows and grows ? At some point the balloon is going to burst , and then we 'll all be put on bread and water , " he said . This was the introduction to his favorite subject . He had money on the brain . Not his own money  --  he was n't especially well off  --  but the nation 's economy . The investors ' money . The anonymous billions in the banks . You might say it was an occupational hazard . Marie tried to listen , but she could n't grasp the dizzyingly enormous and abstract amounts . It was as if the banker were injecting some foreign liquid into her head . <p> " But the devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ducked a little as if he were referring to himself . He came from a fundamentalist home but had lost his faith . The only biblical figure he believed in was the devil , with whom the widower felt a kind of complicity , because every day he participated in the revels around the golden calf . He would literally wake up at night and touch his forehead and feel two tender bumps that turned slowly into miniature cow 's horns . Nevertheless , he was in his element among numbers and banknotes . Securities and market quotations . And he often stayed at his desk in the vast office landscape after four , when all the other bankers had gone home . <p> He and Marie sat for a long time without saying anything . The rain had stopped . And it was getting close to the time when Marie had to go down and lock the laundromat . The chubby little widower went with her . He walked with tiny , mincing steps and placed his feet like a ballet dancer . They said good-bye at the corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty . She lined the laundry baskets up so they would be in a straight row for the first customers the next morning . She turned off the lights and left . The air was heavy and full of gasoline fumes . That evening , for some reason , she was depressed . Was it the poor man 's hands , her loveless life , or the unhealthy air that gave her a headache ? <p> She went up to her apartment , looking forward to getting into bed . Sleeping was one of her life 's greatest pleasures . She was a sound sleeper and dreamed vividly every night . She lived a far more involved and intense life at night than during the day . She dreamed that the florist proposed to her and made a wreath of pink sweet pea that he placed on her head . She dreamed that she was swimming up from the bottom of a stinking river with a baby that looked like a frog next to her . She knew she would be able to get up and just managed to catch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the side of the wharf and onto the quay . <p> Things she did n't give a second thought during the day came out in her dreams . She meticulously entered each dream in a notebook , which she called " The Book of Dreams " and which lay out in the open in the living room on the television set or next to the telephone . <p> She went in and brushed her teeth , washed her face , dried it thoroughly so it was shiny and warm . She opened the window , rolled down the blind , went to bed . A police car drove by with its siren blaring before she could fall asleep and begin to dream . <p> She was already awake by five o'clock , an hour before the alarm clock was set to go off . She got up feeling tense , unrested , as if she were expecting something that day . She made the bed and put two curlers in her hair on the side where she had a wave she did n't like . She left the curlers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She took a detour to get some fresh air before she had to go into the laundromat and stay there all day . It suddenly seemed like a prison to her . The sun was shining . The streets were filthy . It promised to be a warm day . She went into the park of the agricultural college . She walked onto one of the lawns . This was prohibited . She picked a flower . This was even more strictly prohibited . A groundskeeper came and kicked her out . She had to hand over her flower , a blue pansy ; then the man escorted her over to the gate and stood there , as if to make sure she would n't slip in again . <p> Marie took yet another detour and arrived at the laundromat almost half an hour late . A young woman with two children was standing there waiting to get in . Marie apologized , explaining that she had n't slept well and had a headache . The woman nodded sympathetically , hurried in and tossed her clothes into one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was excruciating for her to open her mouth to chat with customers she usually talked to . She happened to think of the concentration camps that she had heard so much about in school or came across on television or in some novel . And it seemed to her that she could easily adapt herself to the daily routine in one of those camps . She already had one inside herself . <p> She was washing the repairman 's clothes . Normally she did n't pay attention to what she laundered . But she could recognize the shirt he had been wearing the day he repaired the machines . A chalk-white shirt with a red pattern . It took her a very long time to fold his clothes . There were four terry-cloth towels , two bath towels , a set of bedclothes , a dish towel , four fishnet undershirts , eight pairs of shorts  --  two white , two blue , two black , two brown  --  and four permanent-press shirts . Marie put the clothes in a laundry bag and set it aside . <p> The rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was five-thirty . He had n't come . She waited for him until seven o'clock . She had n't doubted for a moment that he would come . Then she went home . She could n't eat supper . Not even a fried egg . Neither television nor a library book entertained her . She went to bed early . She woke up in the middle of the night , crying in her sleep . She got up and stayed awake for the rest of the night . She was afraid to lie down and sleep again . Morning came . She dragged herself through the day and forced herself not to look at the time . During her lunch break , she went into the florist 's shop . She bought ten of the inexpensive mixed tulips on display outside . <p> " What happened ? " the florist asked , as he wrapped the flowers in thin green paper . " It 's only Wednesday . " <p> " What could have happened ? " Marie said evasively . But she stood there after she had paid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added with a delicate but slightly awkward gesture . <p> " Yes , we all certainly yearn for variety , " said the florist . His voice was like a breath of wind , and he spoke very softly . <p> " We just need to find each other . " Marie smiled absentmindedly . <p> " There might be something to that . People go around so strangely by themselves . " The florist looked down at the glass counter shyly . He had an attractive little shop . It had bamboo shelves with dried flowers in elaborate arrangements . Dried flowers were his hobby . There were several rows of bouquets hanging upside down to dry above the door to the back room . <p> " Can you really dry roses ? " Marie asked , looking up at one of the bouquets . <p> " Yes , they lose only a little of their color , but otherwise they keep well . " He took a beautiful flower arrangement with many different flowers down and pointed out the roses for her . <p> " Why , it ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fascinated . <p> " Yes , I put them together to music . For me sounds have colors . " <p> " What kind of music do you use ? " <p> " I only have a transistor radio . " <p> " Station 3 ? " Marie asked . <p> The florist nodded . " Would you like this ? " he said pushing the white porcelain pot over to her . <p> " I ca n't accept that . " Marie 's face turned bright red . <p> " Of course you can , just take it . " <p> " No , some other time . " Marie was breathing quickly . <p> " There may not be another time , " said the florist and looked at her plaintively . He put the arrangement back on the shelf . Marie felt she had made a horrible mistake and racked her brains about how she could make things right again . She knew that the florist was having a rough time and could barely make ends meet . She said good-bye and left with the tulips . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was the finest and most exalted human being in the world . She had almost forgotten the repairman when he popped in just before she was about to go home . She unlocked the door to the back room and quickly found his bag , which she handed to him without saying a word . <p> " How much do you want for this ? " he asked . He was dressed very nicely , as if he was going to a party . His hair was combed back with brilliantine . Marie noticed that his hips were very slender . She mumbled the amount . He produced some bills from his pocket , and Marie started to go for change . <p> " It does n't matter , " the repairman said . " just came back from America , where I worked for six years . Over there , you always give a tip . " <p> But Marie gave him the change . What was she supposed to do with four kroner ? <p> " I 've been working here at home for two and a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes . " <p> " But then we do get something for our money , too  --  hospitals , schools , social security , disability pension , welfare . " <p> " You intrigue me , " he said , staring at her . <p> " Me ? " <p> " Yes , you 're unusual . " <p> ' ? ' m like everybody else . " <p> " I can tell by looking at you that you feel like having a drink , " he said , a little like an American . <p> " No , that 's not it exactly , " Marie said awkwardly . <p> " Come on , " he said , touching her shoulder . She jumped as if she had gotten an electric shock . <p> " You 're a frightened little bird , " he said , shutting the door behind them . Marie walked down the sidewalk slightly ahead of him . The street and houses she knew so well seemed unreal to her , like pictures she 'd seen of other planets . They went into a bar that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vermouth . The repairman had a beer . <p> " Cheers . What 's your name ? " <p> " Marie . " <p> " Martin , but people call me Tor . So you can choose . " <p> Marie looked around the room . It was the first time she had been in this bar . It was dim and cozy . She felt safe , as when she was lying under her quilt at night . <p> " You see , when you 've been away for a couple of years , all your friends have scattered to the four winds . " Tor leaned eagerly over the table . There was something down to earth and direct about him which surprised her , because most of the people she met seemed so complicated . <p> " Really ? " she said . <p> " Yes  --  I 'm living in my brother-in-law 's basement out on Amager now . My sister 's in the hospital with female problems and comes home next week . So I do n't know if I can still live there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then  --  I 've been through it all  --  the whole business down and back up again . " <p> " Really ? " <p> " I suppose you think it 's strange for me to be sitting here talking about myself . " <p> " No , not at all , " said Marie . She liked him already . She liked practically everyone , except for her boss . Tor finished his drink and ordered another beer . <p> " I have a sister too , " Marie began slowly . <p> " Does she look like you ? " Tor asked , interested . <p> " No , anything but . She 's blond . " <p> " I 've always been most attracted to brunettes . " <p> Marie did n't answer . She felt confused . She thought about her sister , whom she usually never thought about . Her sister had a husband and three children and lived in an apartment out in Bradby Strand . Marie spent Christmas Eve there and one day in the summer when the weather was good and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her sister 's problems with her husband and her finances and her older children , who did n't see any sense in going to school . Marie did n't really have any problems . None of any significance . <p> " Funny thing about families , you cling to them in one way or another , you know . After all , that 's where you had your childhood . " <p> " Yes , " said Marie . She did n't cling to her family . It had disintegrated a long time ago when her parents died . But she could n't explain that to him . <p> Tor went on , " I feel like holding your hand . " When she gave him her hand , he asked , " What are you afraid of ? " <p> " I 'm not afraid , " she said . It was true . She was never afraid . Except of going on welfare and having to stand there and say things about her private life in order to get money for her rent . Or ending up like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through trash cans , loaded down with plastic bags and packages , and wandering restlessly in the streets like ghosts from the past . <p> " Summer came late this year  --  not until now , in September , " she said , just to say something . His hand was soft and lay like a caress around hers . Her whole body was tense and warm . Most of all , she felt like going home and putting on some other clothes . Something nicer . A new white blouse . <p> " Shall we go to my place ? " he asked . Marie took her hand away . He stood up as if he did n't need an answer . They took a taxi out to Amager . Marie felt almost as if things were happening too fast , even though she did want to go to bed with him . It had been several years since she had been in love . She had done what she could to avoid it . She did n't feel strong enough . But now the damage had been done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and into the cellar entrance . Next to the furnace room was a large flat . There was an old yellowed poster with the Eiffel Tower on it and a green curtain that did n't completely cover the window but which Tor drew closed anyway . Marie sat down on the bed . There was a table but no chair . A suitcase was lying on the table . Tor put his bag of laundry in the corner next to the door . <p> " Are you going to stay in Denmark ? " asked Marie . <p> " That depends on the possibilities . " <p> Tor went over to her and began to unbutton her blouse . It took a long time . And Marie thought that that moment , which could be eternity itself , would never come again . <p> " Help me , " he said , when at last he had gotten it unbuttoned . Marie took her clothes off in front of him . <p> The sheet and the quilt cover were white with an almost invisible blue stripe . They did n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they had the whole night ahead of them . <p> " You 're exactly my type , " whispered Tor . <p> " You 're exactly mine , " Marie whispered back . And noticed how her body gradually became flesh and blood . They made love in the dark and fell asleep together . <p> Marie woke up when it was starting to get light and discovered that the sheet and quilt were smeared with blood . She felt an urge to get up and get quietly dressed and flee . But she could n't run away from the blood stains . She cursed her bad luck . She cursed the fact that it had to come precisely that night . She lay and waited , scarcely daring to breathe . It was a lovely gray morning . The diffuse light streamed in through the window . <p> Half asleep , Tor reached for the alarm clock and saw that it was only five o'clock . <p> " We can sleep for another hour , " he mumbled and pulled her close to him and kissed her . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed like a rocket . He pulled the quilt cover off . The blood had run through the cover onto the quilt . <p> " Oh no , how am I going to get that out ? " he wailed , " My sister is coming home on Thursday . It ' s the end of the month and I ca n't afford to buy a new one . I 've used their room for free and been treated well and now I 've made a mess of everything . This is terrible . I 've got no excuse for it . " Tor was almost crying from rage . He threw the quilt cover on the floor . <p> " It 'll have to go in the trash . There 's nothing else to do , " he said . Marie was lying stiff as a board and freezing . Most of the tan from Majorca was gone ; she was white . <p> " It 'll wash out , " she said and sat up in bed , dizzy , as if she 'd been hit . Tor did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there bewildered , looking it over carefully to see how much damage had been done . Marie got up and began to hunt for her clothes , which were scattered all over the floor . She wanted to get home in a hurry and did n't ask where the bathroom was . <p> " Are you leaving ? " he asked , as if he were beginning to come around and had n't noticed her until then . Marie did n't answer . She was putting her black corduroy pants on . <p> " Are you leaving ? " he repeated . He was still standing there with the blood-stained baby-blue quilt in one hand . <p> " I 'll take the quilt cover , sheet , and quilt with me and wash them . You can pick them up after work , " she said , taking the quilt cover from the floor and folding it . Then she took the sheet off the bed . <p> " What about the mattress ? " said Tor . <p> " You scrub the spots with a toothbrush  --  but it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure it 'll come out ? " <p> " Yes , " Marie said . She was really far from certain but did n't want to frighten him even more . She took the quilt out of his hand . <p> " Do you have something I can put this in ? " she asked . Tor looked around the room and threw up his arms in despair . Marie put the sheet and quilt cover inside the quilt and rolled them together . <p> " Do you have a piece of string I can tie around these ? " <p> " I have n't really gotten myself moved in yet . " he said apologetically . <p> Marie put the quilt under her arm and hesitated , trying to stretch the moment out . She wanted to kiss him , but she walked out the door and left him standing naked in the middle of the floor next to the bed , where only the mattress was left . <p> Marie felt desolate . She walked as if she were in a trance moving her legs mechanically . She saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intense , like someone who has been executed and entered the kingdom of the dead . The sidewalk 's flagstones were chalk-white , the balconies ' flower boxes red and blue like the pictures in an ad . One night with her lover was both nothing and much more than nothing . She walked and walked , the quilt under her arm . Across Knippels Bridge . Past the Christiansborg Parliament Building . She walked all the way to the Town Hall Square before she took a bus . She rode one stop too far and had to walk back to the laundromat . She entered  --  without noticing that the door had been open all night  --  and put coins into a machine , as if she were a regular customer . She sat down in one of the chairs and waited until the last cycle stopped . The quilt dried and smelled of soap and looked like new . <p> Marie pressed the sheet and quilt cover in the mangle until they were completely smooth and whiter than an ad , whiter than snow . <p> The colors around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything were bathed in light . Even the gray dryers were shining . The orange lids on the washing machines hurt her eyes . She realized that she could n't stand to be in the laundromat . She had to get away . Someone was already there , doing a load of laundry . The smell nauseated her . She felt that the skin was falling off her face and her head was turning into a skull . She had a dry , ashy taste in her mouth , and she could feel her kidneys which she ordinarily never noticed . <p> But before she could make it out the door , her friend the banker came in to drop off a bag of laundry . He was a horrible sight . The expression on his face contorted into a devil 's mask . He wore a peculiar grin and held his hands behind his back . <p> " Which hand do you want ? " he said . <p> " The left , " Marie said , surprised at how easy it was to answer . The widower gave her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgot to say thank you . Because she did n't want that ring at all . <p> " Shall we get married ? " he asked , putting the ring on her finger . Slowly , Marie returned to reality . And because she was so filled with love , she said yes . The word had been on the tip of her tongue . <p> " I 'll treat you like a queen , " he said . " You wo n't need to work . " <p> " No , I have to work  --  but not here  --  somewhere else . " <p> The banker patted her hair and asked if he might invite her out to dinner to celebrate . Marie nodded , or imagined that she nodded . He stood there , shuffling his feet as if he was waiting for a kiss or a handshake . But Marie said , " You should stop working in the bank so your eczema will go away . I 'm sure it 's the money . " <p> " No , it 's my nerves , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they 've already helped . Look . " <p> He showed her his hands like a dutiful schoolboy . Marie examined them with the stern look of a school teacher . <p> " Yes , maybe , " she said so as not to hurt him . He fluttered his eyes out of sheer joy . Then he retreated sideways to the door and hurried off to be at the bank on time at precisely nine o'clock . Outside the window , he waved to her with an easy motion . <p> Marie went home to take a bath and change . The first thing she heard when she walked in the door was the alarm clock ; its ticking was excruciatingly loud . Even after she took it and locked it in the closet , she still thought she could hear a faint noise , like an insect you ca n't see . <p> " It intensifies your senses to be separated from the one you love , " she said as she got undressed to get into the shower . <p> Marie had taken Tor 's bedclothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packed them up in brown paper that she 'd brought from the laundromat . She put on her only dress  --  she who always wore pants  --  and rode the long way out to Amager on the bus . She found the house and for the first time saw how lovely it was . It was a little red brick place . There was lawn furniture in the yard ; it had n't been taken in for the winter yet . Most of the lawn was planted with grass , and there were a few crooked , old fruit trees . Marie picked up a pear that had fallen onto the grass . She sat down in one of the garden chairs and ate the pear so that juice ran down her chin and between her fingers . The grass was a little too green , almost neonlike , but other than that there was nothing unusual . The chair was a chair , the flowers were flowers , and the house was a house . The sky was blue . The sun was warm . <p> She walked over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and placed the package up against the door so that Tor could n't miss finding it . She adjusted it so that it would stay upright and patted it like a child . She had even thought of writing a note and putting it with the package : " Everything is clean ! Love , Your M. " <p> But she preferred disappearing without a word . She did n't want to be on his mind . <p> From Amager she went into town . She withdrew her savings from the bank . She kept a little for herself . The rest she sent anonymously to the florist . After she had been to the post office , she could finally return to the laundromat and continue working as if nothing had happened . The entire trip had n't taken more than a couple of hours . It was the first time in the five years that she had worked at the laundromat that she had taken the liberty of leaving during business hours . So it took her completely by surprise when , from the bus , she saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The owner was standing there waiting for her . It had been only two weeks since he was last there . He was snorting like a raging stallion . He had unbuttoned his dark blue cashmere coat  --  the air was muggy and humid because of the steam from the washing machines . <p> " Let 's go in and sit down , " he snarled . Marie unlocked the office door . The owner sat down on the chair . <p> " You can consider yourself terminated as of the first . I ca n't use you any longer . " <p> " Yes , but . . . " <p> " I ca n't use your excuses either . They 're of absolutely no concern to me . People are standing in line to get jobs . You could feed pigs with them . Now I would like to see the accounts , " he added and turned around on the chair . He had a wide bull 's neck with three or four rolls of fat across it . The closely cropped hairs at the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat with his back to Marie and leafed through the account books . He dragged his fat and rather stiff index finger slowly down over Marie 's neat columns of numbers , pausing to let his finger linger beside a number and asking for information about something he did n't understand . Marie was certain that there were n't any mistakes and answered curtly and with one syllable words . She was standing behind him and looking at the back of his neck . She remembered that he had once taken her by the chin and said they could talk about things when she had gotten a little more meat on her bones . And that the older woman who had been fired and whose job she had taken had cried and said to him , " You 'll pay for this ! " <p> Then the owner asked about something else . Marie did n't hear him . He repeated his question , and it sounded like an order . " You 'll pay for this , " rang in Marie 's ears . In front of her on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pointed awl that she 'd used to loosen coins if they got stuck in a machine . She picked up the awl and thrust it into the back of his neck between two rolls of fat . She pushed so violently that it went through his neck and came out the other side , just under his Adam 's apple . He fell forward without a sound , and his forehead came to rest on the white page with the rows of numbers . <p> Marie felt a great relief and suddenly knew that this was what she had been preparing for her whole life . And it took nothing more than courage and a strong arm . <p> Translated by Jeanne Griffin <p> Born on the island of Funen in 1942 , Kirsten Thorup made her writing debut as a poet in 1967 and has since gained prominence as a novelist and story writer , though she has also written a number of plays for radio , television , and film .
