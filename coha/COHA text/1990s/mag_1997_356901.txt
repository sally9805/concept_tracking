In the brave new world of deregulation , airlines have foundered from a deadly mix of overexpansion and downward pressure on fares . Then there is Midwest Express Airlines , an upstart based in Milwaukee , Wis. , that pampers customers with wide leather seats , free champagne and provisions that arrive on china  --  and thus far has a habit of pulling premium fares from passengers ' pockets . <P> Tim Hoeksema , 50 , Midwest 's chairman and CEO , is a walking advertisement for the benefits of deregulation . He started as a pilot with Kimberly-Clark Corp . in 1969 , back when the government assigned routes and set profit margins , assuring existing carriers a captive market and barring new entrants . It was partly because Kimberly-Clark 's headquarters , then in Neenah , Wis. , was off the beaten path that the company started its private fleet . " Air travel was difficult and expensive . We were frustrated , " Hoeksema says . The paper company named its unit Midwest Express Airlines and began offering service to the public  --  specifically the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Civil Aeronautics Board was abolished and a flood of new airlines entered the market . <P> Hoeksema saw the company 's net income triple from 1994 to 1995 , the year before Kimberly-Clark sold the airline . Net income grew by more than 12% in 1996 , to around $20 million . Midwest now flies to 23 cities in the U.S. and Canada from hubs in Milwaukee and Omaha , Neb . Compound annual growth has averaged about 20% over the past five years  --  significantly better than that of most other airlines . Now Hoeksema plans a third hub  --  location to be announced  --  assuming the good times continue to roll . <P> The secret of Midwest 's success is niche marketing : customer-first service to business travelers from underserved locations in the Midwest , plus nonstop flights to major cities elsewhere . For both , customers pay extra to be pampered . Those premium fares in turn pump up Midwest 's revenue per passenger mile , or yield . Midwest 's 24 DC-9s feature leather seats set two by two with no center seats . Dealing with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff can give more individual attention . Besides , says Bob Bell , president of the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce , " they have hot , freshly baked chocolate-chip cookies . " <P> Midwest has a good record on safety , although it had one crash , which killed 31 , in 1985 . It has been profitable every year since 1987 . Lately the fresh-cookie airline has pitched itself to pleasure travelers  --  though there are limits on how much it can push the price in that segment . Says Wally Durso , president of Travel Dynamics of Brookfield , Wis. , a Milwaukee suburb : " I do n't believe fares are No. 1 . If Midwest Express is within $50 of a competing airline , a lot of my clients will go with Midwest Express . " <P> " With deregulation , airlines have become like restaurants , ranging from four stars to budget chains , " says Clifford Winston of Washington 's Brookings Institution and co-author of The Evolution of the Airline Industry . On the other hand , he notes , Midwest 's reach may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trend toward lower costs and cheaper fares to match , exemplified by that mass-transit paragon , Southwest Airlines .
