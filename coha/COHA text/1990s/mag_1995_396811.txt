We rise at three , linger over a quiet breakfast , and depart the refuge at four , our headlamps shining the way . A few minutes later we separate , Pierre Tardivel skiing off down the Vallee Blanche , while photographer Chris Noble , Chris 's assistant , Shannon Walsh , and I switch to crampons and follow la voie normale , the easy way , up the shoulder of the 13,937-foot Mont Blanc du Tacul , one of the principal subpeaks of Mont Blanc in the French Alps . Day breaks at 5:30 , and two hours later we 're standing on the summit of the Tacul . It 's a razor-sharp June day , as clear as it gets . We pick out the Matterhorn , 80 miles off , and the Eiger , 100 miles away in the Bernese Oberland . The scary view is straight down : the Gervasutti Couloir , bulging and dropping like the face of some monstrous wave , then bottoming out 2,700 vertical feet below on the floor of the glacier . A few minutes before eight , Tardivel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the center of the Gervasutti . Tardivel always climbs up what he 's going to ski down . Ask him why , and he says simply : " Gouvy and Moroni . " Bruno Gouvy was the Marlboro-sponsored extremist who in 1990 took a helicopter to the summit of the nearby Aiguille Verte , intending to snowboard the south-facing Whymper Couloir . To warm up , he took a few practice turns in the soft snow on the north side of the mountain , at the head of the 3,000-vertical-foot Couturier Couloir . Problem was , under the powder was black ice , and as soon as Gouvy tried to set an edge , he was gone . Alain Moroni met his end in June 1993 on the north face of the Aiguille du Plan , directly over the village of Chamonix . Rather than climb the face from below , he took the tram up to the Aiguille du Midi and traversed across . " Both were killed because they started from the top , " Tardivel says . " They did n't know the condition of the snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Always climb before . " I watch Tardivel as he steps onto the summit of the Tacul . He 's wearing a natty cerise ski suit and a matching headband , with a shock of blond hair protruding above it and a pair of comically bushy brows poking out below . In place of the gray-faced grimness you might expect from a man about to hurl himself into the abyss , there 's a broad , slightly snaggletoothed grin and endless bonhomie . He walks around for awhile , pointing out various " classic " couloirs and encyclopedically rattling off the names of those who first skied them : Sylvain Saudan , Patrick Vallencant , Jean-Marc Boivin . He stows his crampons , checks his skis and bindings , swings his arms to keep warm . Then , as the moment of truth draws near , he starts to whistle . It 's a medley of traditionals : Beethoven 's " Ode to Joy , " the theme from Dr. Zhivago , and finally something that sounds suspiciously like " The Star Spangled Banner . " " What is that tune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " confirms Tardivel , green eyes twinkling . " It 's very sympatical , no ? " Make no mistake , Pierre Tardivel is getting a great deal of enjoyment out of the idea of three Americans crossing the Atlantic to watch him ski l'extreme . Partly , of course , it is national chauvinism . While the sport of extreme skiing in America might be about cliff-jumping and made-for-TV competitions , to the French it is an altogether purer and more serious discipline  --  " a form of Alpinism , " as Tardivel puts it . Sharp skis are tools of mountaineering , just like crampons and ice axes , and the kinds of slopes that can be negotiated with them were barely climbable a generation ago . But Tardivel 's happiness also has to do with personal recognition . While it 's nice to find virgin couloirs and ski them , there 's nothing like an audience of foreigners to legitimize the experience . And the truth is , in his own shy , nerdish way , Tardivel is a bit of a showman . At the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a sport that has few practitioners left . Gouvy , Vallencant , and Boivin are dead ; others have retired or graduated to the newer thrill sports . But thanks to three long-standing sponsorship deals  --  with Dynastar , Tecnica , and Eider , a skiwear manufacturer  --  Tardivel can afford to keep knocking off new routes . If you visit his cozy house on the outskirts of Annecy , about an hour west of Chamonix , he 'll show you the picture albums cataloging his 48 first descents , including one from Mount Everest 's south summit  --  at 28,766 feet , the highest anyone has ever been on skis . It 's funny to watch Tardivel 's wife , Kathy , when he goes through this ritual . She 's a Parisian , not a jock ; her idea of an outdoor excursion is a promenade along the manicured shores of the Lac d'Annecy with their eight-month-old daughter , Angelique , in the stroller . For the time being , Kathy seems supportive enough of her husband 's business ; she runs the promotional end of things from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pierre lays out his plans for the future . There are still dozens of good firsts to be skied in the Alps . Almost all of the Himalayas remain unskied . And then there 's the real frontier  --  North America , with all its commercial possibilities . " I would like 10 more years in extreme skiing , " Tardivel says . " Jean-Marc Boivin was 40 when he did some of his nicest skiing . " Will Tardivel last that long , financially speaking ? It 's difficult to climb , tram , and sell pictures at the same time . His sponsor do n't have the money to underwrite big , Himalayan-scale expeditions , and it 's hard for him to compete with the new wave of snowboard and parapente extremists when it comes to landing corporate backing . Tardivel does n't like to give speeches or even show films in front of large groups , and you get the sense that appearances he has made have n't been big successes . Then , too , there are the duties of parenthood . " You ca n't put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the skis are in there , " Kathy says . " And I want another one . " Still , Tardivel insists , the exuberance he feels in the mountains is n't incompatible with family life . The sport has nothing to do , he says , with courting death . " It 's the ambience of the steeps , and a taste for risk , and the beauty of the mountains , all those things taken together , " he says . " It 's about confronting our limits , and I 'm just trying to open up new places people can do that . " But above all , it 's about being first . " I 'm not interested if something has been done , " he says . " I want to know if it can be done . That 's the adventure . That 's discovery . " The Gervasutti was first skied in 1968 by Sylvain Saudan , the granddaddy of all extreme skiers  --  quite a feat considering the equipment of the day and Saudan 's primitive , double-pole technique . " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it in the month of October , because at the time they thought you had to do it in deep powder . They did n't know you could ski spring snow . " Tardivel himself has skied the Gervasutti several times , but always on the traditional line , starting from the ridge on the skier 's left . What he has in mind today is to depart directly from the summit of the Tacul and pass beneath a cluster of hanging seracs , aircraft-carrier-sized blocks of ice . Just below the seracs is the trickiest stretch of the descent , a short pitch where the slope approaches 60 degrees . ( For purposes of comparison , the steepest black diamond runs at American ski resorts typically range from 28 to 35 degrees . At 45 to 50 degrees a skier standing straight up can reach out and touch the slope with his hand ; at 60 degrees he can touch it with his elbow . ) " It is not a true first , " Tardivel says of the route , " because only the top 200 meters are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8:30 , with the spring snow just starting to soften in the morning light , Tardivel launches himself from the summit , cranking a series of cautious turns under the enormous seracs . He has to stop , clinging to the near-vertical wall , while we work our way a half mile back down the ridge to the north to find a good place from which to shoot the rest of the descent . From that distance , it 's hard to pick out details of the terrain ; he 's just a tiny figure dwarfed by the landscape . But there 's huge suspense in each pole plant , because after it , he falls 15 sometimes 30 feet before his skis grab on the hard snow and he can stop . Until the slope flattens to a more " reasonable " 50 to 55 degrees , he takes each turn one at a time . In its deliberate fitfulness , it seems more like downclimbing than skiing . Chris , Shannon , and I ski back down to the refuge by following the voie normale , which even so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're back before noon . Pierre skins back up the glacier and arrives a few minutes later , panting but ecstatic . " Did you see that snowboarder in the helicopter ? " he asks . " He wanted to ski the Gervasutti , but I got there first , " Tardivel chortles , pleased at the turn of events . The snowboarder ended up skiing a neighboring couloir , the Jeager , which Tardivel dismissively refers to as " very classic . " By " classic , " I realize , Tardivel means easy . Basic . Piece of cake . Pierre Tardivel caught the extreme disease at the age of 15 , when he saw a Vallencant film called El Gringo Skiador . He was in Tignes at the time , on a summer vacation , and the next day he hiked through the wildflowers to the Dome de Pramecou and pulled off his first off-piste descents on the few north-facing couloirs that still held snow . That autumn he fell in with another skier from Annecy , Daniel Chauchefoin . Ten years older and much more experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1986 , the two pioneered dozens of routes , first in the Aravis , outside of Annecy , and later in the Chamonix valley . But the two drifted apart after Tardivel , who was beginning to see the career possibilities of the sport , started to search out sponsorship deals . They have n't spoken in years . " Daniel did n't think it was a good idea to mix money and the mountains , " says Tardivel , sounding a little rueful about the breakup . " But my thought was , if you can find a job that allows you to do what you want to do , and promote the sport to new converts  --  well , what is wrong with that ? " Tardivel pauses , shaking his head . " France is different than America . There 's an attitude in this country that it 's shameful to make money , and if you do , you should n't talk about it . " Tardivel today says he makes between $35,000 and $45,000 a year from his three sponsors and various appearances , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his future , he went to college , obtained a degree in accounting , and landed a job in a bank in Chamonix . At the same time , he was pursuing certification as a guide de haute montagne and trying to cement his reputation as a skieur de l'extreme . The former was easy enough  --  he became a guide at age 25 , the second-youngest ever  --  but the latter was considerably harder . Chamonix can be a tough place to make it if you 're not a local , and Tardivel 's straight-arrow act  --  he put on a coat and tie every day to work in the bank  --  was the cause of much amusement . People referred to him derogatorily as a cafiste , after the CAF , the boy-scoutish French Alpine Club . Even today Tardivel hardly gets the star treatment . The afternoon before we take the tram up to the Aiguille du Midi and the refuge , as we lunch at the l 'M restaurant in downtown Chamonix , Tardivel spots Sylvain Saudan himself , making his way to the bar with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says hello when Tardivel salutes him , but he does n't ask what his heir apparent is up to and moves off after a brief moment . It 's all very subtle , but it 's definitely a brush-off . In 1988 , after he and Kathy were married , Tardivel moved back to Annecy . It was a bigger , more cosmopolitan place , and Tardivel says he 's glad of the change . The result , though , is that he will probably always be considered an outsider in the extreme world . Tardivel professes indifference . " I 'm not loved by some of the people up there in Chamonix , " he admits , " but then I have the impression that they do n't love one another either . " On our second day , the four of us head back up the voie normale to the head of the Jeager Couloir , where Chris has spotted a particularly photogenic face . To me it looks just short of vertical ; Pierre , after a quick reconnaissance , says it 's between 55 and 60 degrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The problem is the exposure : It hangs out in space , and there are some very sharp-looking rocks lurking below it . " This is classic over here , " Pierre says , indicating the normal entry point into the couloir . Then he points to the face opposite us  --  the one Chris has picked out . " That is not classic over there . " It 's plain he 's apprehensive about the stunt . Nevertheless , after climbing the face from below , and scraping at the snow every few feet with his open hand , he agrees to attempt it . After yesterday , it 's nice to see Tardivel in action at close range . Trim and ultrafit , he carries the bare minimum in his pack : crampons ; two ice axes , their shanks curved in such a way that his gloves do n't come into contact with the snow ( when skiing , he puts one in a loop of his climbing harness ) ; a length of seven-mm rope for emergency rappels ; a small assortment of ice screws , pitons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few energy bars . His skis , which he had a hand in designing , are 190-cm Dynastar Verticals  --  light , stiff , relatively wide-waisted ( 67 cm ) , and springy ; his poles are of Kevlar . But the real point of interest are the bindings : old Marker MRRs mounted on top of Petzl randonnee plates , which are essential for skinning on approaches in the backcountry . The MRRs are essential too , because they 're light and they 're not step-ins . Instead they feature quick-release tabs on the heels , so with just a touch of his finger , Tardivel can pop his skis on and off in delicate , ultrasteep situations . In his turns , Tardivel strives for lightness , fluidity , and the minimum amount of heel lift necessary . Often on the steeps he 'll drive his body around with his hands , his legs spread at shoulder width and beyond and his body hunched forward farther than one sees in the textbooks . It is n't always pretty , but it 's a secure , almost bombproof technique . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edges forward , and then studies his spot a good half minute before he makes the first turn . It 's less exciting to watch than a World Cup downhill , but with the void looming below , it 's quite a bit more intense . Essentially , he 's not skiing so much as mountaineering . Or rather big-wall rapelling , but without a rope . Each turn is a lunge ; each stop a precious foothold . That afternoon we sit around on the deck at the refuge and watch a stream of day-climbers toil up the voie normale . After two nights of bunking at altitude and climbing the Tacul twice in two days , we three Americans are almost comatose . But Tardivel seems possessed of boundless reserves of energy . After lecturing us on high-altitude birds , parapenting , and the various faces of the 8,000-meter peaks that have not yet been skied , he takes it upon himself to clear the refuge 's roof of a menacing block of ice the size of a car . It 's a complicated and ultimately futile piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts of half a dozen people , and in the end , he settles for simply shoveling the deck . Tardivel is shoveling so vigorously , in fact , that he does n't hear the refuge manager calling him to the phone . He 's stricken when he hears that Kathy has called ; apparently he 's missed the nine-month anniversary of Angelique 's birth , and outgoing calls are n't allowed in all but the gravest emergencies . But the day is saved when Kathy calls back after dinner . Pierre races off excitedly to talk to Angelique , and tell his wife of his plans for tomorrow : a first descent of an obscure and hitherto overlooked couloir on the Tacul . When he comes back , though , he 's shaking his head . " Kathy cries every time I leave to do a first , " he says . " C'est penible . She does n't understand the point to which you can control the situation . " Back in 1982 , when Tardivel and Chauchefoin had notched a first descent on the central couloir leading down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd glimpsed a small , sinuous chute just to the south . It had n't had enough snow in it to be feasible at the time , but this year , Tardivel thought , it might be . It was not aesthetically perfect : a twisty upper passage that fed into a steep middle section , then jogged to the skier 's right two thirds of the way down in order to miss a nasty rock outcropping . Once past that , it was n't too technical , but it was still 50 degrees . We leave the refuge at 4:15 A.M. , skiing fast down the Valle Blanche by the light of our headlamps . At the foot of the Diable , we cache our lunch and skins , which we 'll need later for the long hike out , then switch to crampons and axes for the hike up to the foot of the couloir . First light finds us at the rimaye , or bergschrund , the crevasse that marks the fracture line between the moving glacier in the valley and the more or less stationary snowfields above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down ; from here on up , Tardivel climbs alone . The rimaye is dripping with icicles , like the maw of some hideous sea creature , and it takes Tardivel a while to find a place his axes can get a grip without bringing the whole fragile curtain shattering down . Once he 's past it and in the couloir itself , he moves fast . By 7:30 he 's at the col . I watch his descent through binoculars . It 's tricky : The narrow section is icy and no more than 10 feet wide , and there are rocks in the middle that he has to sidestep over . A large streamlet gutters the middle of the chute , forcing him to ski on one side of it , and to pinch his turns at an awkward angle to the fall line . But the crux move is the right-hand traverse above the rocks . He pauses for a long time here , and I begin to think he is considering removing his skis and putting his crampons back on . But then , without warning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much faster than I expect , and cranks a huge , high-speed turn in the lower snowfield to slow down . For a long agonizing second his skis refuse to bite and he careens sideways down the mountain , 30 , 60 , 80 feet , till the edges begin to grab and he finally comes to rest . After that , jumping the rimaye is no big deal , particularly not with an American photographer standing there . The honor of France is at stake , and Tardivel , though he 's no jumper , launches , hunches , and sticks the landing . Thus , 30 minutes after it began , first descent number 49 is in the books . <p>
