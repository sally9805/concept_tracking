Sound of waves and sea birds . A seashore tree stump . Below it , three seaworn rocks , and lying across them , a medieval Japanese sword in its scabbard . Darkness . Silence . A flute plays . Light appears , very slowly , on Komachi , who is wearing a Noh mask of a beautiful young woman . She wears a black kimono and has a white scarf around her waist . Beside her stands Prince Shosho . He is not masked . He has a red scarf over one shoulder . He now has the sword and scabbard in his belt . Flute stops . KOMACHI In the springyoung men come running to loveand killyoung women .
