Photograph ( Far right ) The owner and designer combined twig motif drapery hardware with fabric webbing trim . // When it comes to color , Gari Griffin Rogers not only talks the talk but also walks the walk . As a designer known for using intense colors , she 's been especially daring with the unexpected combinations in her own Birmingham home . And for a really good reason . " I 'm not a cook , " Gari freely admits . " When my husband , Charlie , and I bought our house , I searched for an exciting way to make me want to be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed like the place to start . " As she does for her clients , Gari used favorite possessions to work out a color scheme for the kitchen and adjoining breakfast and sitting area . " I had an old kilim rug that I love , and I had a casual set of hot-pink , purple , and yellow dishes , " she says . " Those were the colors I used . I found a plaid silk fabric that has all the colors for the window treatments . " One of her liveliest colors is the purple used on the cabinets . " We used a highgloss purple enamel . I wanted the shine as well as the color . " Equally intense are the fuchsia ceilings in both the kitchen and the breakfast/family room .

" A mix of patterns would have been too much with these colors . I also kept the furniture shapes simple and neutral . The glass table works because it 's totally neutral . " Gari 's secret for pulling this bold scheme together ? " Remember to start with one color you love and remember that everything ca n't be drop-dead . When you use colors this intense , you need supporting players in the background . You have to know where to stop .

Choose simple furniture pieces . If the walls are dark , use lighter woods for contrast . Introduce glass or acrylic tables as noncolor , nonpattern pieces . Minimize both pattern and mixture of fabrics . Try to find one main fabric with all your key colors and intensities. // <p>
