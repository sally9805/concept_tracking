<p> Inez , Ky. - Tommy Fletcher never asked the president to come around his front porch , never wanted his picture flashed across the country , never sought to be the recruitment poster for Lyndon Johnson 's War on Poverty . <p> Mr. Fletcher was an unemployed sawmill worker 28 years ago , and he did n't enjoy his role then as a symbol of social ills that federal programs might remedy . Nor is he happy now , serving as an example of what those programs failed to do . <p> Mr. Johnson flew to this isolated Appalachian town April 24 , 1964 , to visit Mr. Fletcher 's humble mountainside house - a " tarpaper shack , " as some obliging news accounts referred to it then . The president shook a lot of hands and pledged to help the poor . It was an election year . <p> " I always feel that these occasions are too much ' onstage , ' " Lady Bird Johnson recorded in her diary for that day . " But perhaps it is the only way to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand . " <p> Now , almost three decades later , presidential candidates are descending on another pocket of poverty - in this case , the south-central Los Angeles riot scene - and promising government programs to make life better . <p> While George Bush and Bill Clinton provide latter-day echoes of LBJ , Mr. Fletcher and his wife face charges of murdering one child and trying to kill another to collect the burial insurance . <p> Shining the spotlight on everyday Americans to illustrate a problem long has been a favored tactic of politicians . But the story of Tommy Fletcher and of Inez is a reminder that being showcased does not necessarily lead to being salvaged . <p> Billions of federal dollars have been spent since 1964 to combat poverty , and historians and lawmakers continue to debate the effectiveness of the effort . Some programs , such as Head Start , are considered a success . Others have been scaled back or eliminated . <p> For his part , Mr. Fletcher did not find steady work or climb out of his dirt-poor existence . And the town of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The War on Poverty , " said Inez banker Mike Duncan , " did not succeed . " <p> Now 66 , Mr. Fletcher has avoided questions about his Great Society role for years . " That was too long ago , " he said the other day , ending the discussion . He is thin and pale , with watery eyes , palsied hands and breathing problems , and he lives these days in the county jail . <p> Why the 1964 White House advance team searching for photogenic poverty picked him is a public relations decision lost to history . <p> " Damned if I know , " said John B. Callaham , Martin County judge and lifelong Inez resident . " His house was easy to get to , and he had a large family , I guess . " <p> Martin County was - and is - one of the poorest counties in a poor region of the state . Of its 12,526 people , all but 27 are white . <p> Inez , the county seat , sits in a crooked hollow along Rockcastle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of about 600 , it has some modern touches , such as a Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise , satellite dishes and a tanning salon . <p> But for generations its fortunes have been tied to the boom-and-bust coal industry , which offered hard , dangerous labor for the locals and let absentee owners pocket the profits . In 1964 , Inez was sagging . <p> Mr. Fletcher , then 38 , had done some coal mining and some sawmill labor , but not much . His annual income in 1964 was $ 400 , he said . He had a second-grade education , and could barely write his name . <p> The president climbed onto Mr. Fletcher 's porch , where the two sat on a pile of lumber . Mr. Fletcher " described the struggle " of his life , the president later wrote , telling of his worry that his children would not finish school . That , Mr. Johnson said in his autobiography , summed up " the tragic inevitability of the endless cycle of poverty . " <p> The visit lasted 30 minutes . It ended with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to keep those kids in school . " <p> By the late 1970s Mr. Fletcher was out of work , apparently for good . By the early 1980s , complaining of emphysema , he was collecting Social Security disability payments . <p> Ironically , his disappearance from the employment rolls came as Inez and Martin County were in the midst of a boom . <p> Rising coal prices brought prosperity in the form of new trailers , houses , pickup trucks and swimming pools . But the good times faded as coal companies halved their local work force in the 1980s , replacing miners with machines . <p> " The production is up . They 're mining more coal but with fewer people , " said Ed Blackwell , an analyst with the state Department of Employment Services . " There 's nothing for those people there . That 's the only thing they 've known . " <p> Martin County 's unemployment rate is 10.6 percent . But that counts only those looking for a job , and most have stopped looking . Duncan , chairman of the Inez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the county are working . " We 've got a lot of people not in that structure , " he said . " They 've just given up . " <p> Critics of the Great Society legacy say the government makes it easy to do so . " They just set up these programs where people draw checks and watch satellite TV , " said county employee Mike Cassady . <p> Mr. Fletcher does not have satellite TV , but he is drawing a check , $ 284 a month in Social Security . Until this year he was still living in the same house President Johnson visited . <p> His first wife , Nora , who was his first cousin , died of breast cancer in 1983 . Six years ago , Mr. Fletcher , then 60 , married 19-year-old Mary Porter . <p> The new Mrs. Fletcher was a divorced woman with a history of mental problems and , like Fletcher , minimal schooling . <p> They had two children , Ella Rose and Tommy Jr . Last January , Ella Rose , who had a history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of death was listed as epileptic disorder , and she was buried on the mountainside behind the Fletcher house . <p> Then , in February , Tommy Jr. , 4 , became seriously ill while attending Head Start - a federal program begun in the Johnson Administration . A hospital examination revealed 100 times the normal adult dosage of propoxyphene , a painkiller , in his system . <p> Tommy and Mary Fletcher both had prescriptions for Darvon , which contains propoxyphene , according to prosecutor Leo Marcum . And , he said , Tommy Jr . told social workers that he was given a " little pink pill " every morning . <p> Authorities moved on their suspicions . " I come up to the house and I heard her ( wife Mary ) squawling , " Mr. Fletcher said . " She said , ' Somebody called me and said I killed my baby , ' and they 're coming here to take it up .

Mary Fletcher is in a state institution undergoing psychiatric testing to determine if she is competent to stand trial . <p> Prosecutor Marcum said he believes the indigent Fletchers plotted to collect the insurance on the children . They had bought $ 5,000 policies for each . <p> Mr. Fletcher denies the accusations , but ca n't explain how so much medicine got into the children . " I do n't know , " he said in a jailhouse interview . <p> Doug J. Swanson writes for The Dallas Morning News .
