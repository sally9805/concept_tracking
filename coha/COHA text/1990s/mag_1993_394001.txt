In " Fiddler On The Roof " the villagers of Anatevka exuberantly celebrate the joys of tradition , the centuries-old customs that have always given meaning and identity to them as a separate people . And yet those same traditions also cause tragedy when Tevye 's daughter marries a Christian , and he is forced to make himself believe she is worse than dead . Tradition insists , against the testimony of his inmost heart , that he no longer may love his own daughter . Even non-believers need traditions  --  if only a surface celebration of a Christmas they no longer find elsewhere in their year . " We 've always done it this way . " Traditions give a comfortable , trustworthy shape to our years and our lives . But like all other things on the face of the earth  --  food , wine , sex , law and order , even love  --  traditions make good servants but wicked masters . What 's more , as with Tevye , there are good laws and traditions and bad laws and traditions . How do we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he settled the bickering in Corinth over charismatics disrupting the Eucharist by speaking in tongues : Let them alone and see . Does this effusion result in their being more loving , caring and generous outside the church ? If so , it is of the Spirit . Or does it make them more condescending and sneering to those not thus gifted ? If so , then it is of the Evil One . Jesus used the same test : " By their fruits you shall know them . " When Clare Booth Luce was considering conversion to Catholicism she used to look at Catholics and say to herself , " You say you have the truth . Well , the truth should set you free , give you joy . Can I see your freedom ? Can I feel your joy ? " Which of our specifically Catholic laws and traditions set us free and bring us joy , and which bring heartbreak and dehumanization ? Granted , the church enjoins certain options that , in our non-objective moments , we find hateful or forbids options that we find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply hard truths programmed into the natures of things by a God not answerable to us . But could there be issues about which the current ( even centuries-old ) view of the official church is objectively wrong and the informed individual conscience is objectively right ? SCRIPTURE . The two touchstones of Catholic orthodoxy are Scripture and tradition . In the last century and a half , our view of Scripture 's normative function has changed radically from that of a rigid set of literalist doctrines to metaphorical guide to understanding ourselves as human beings , transformed by the life and continuing influence of Christ and by our membership in a worshiping and serving community . Commitment has become more important than unsullied righteousness ; saving one 's soul from atrophy here and now is a truer goal than saving it from some future hell . Most Christians are no longer apprehensive that the Gospels were probably not written by eyewitnesses . They are at peace with the fact the Gospels are approximative , yet no less trustworthy than a modern biography trying to reconstruct as honestly as possible the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . Literate adult Christians are n't too troubled that the stories of , say , the Magi , Peter walking on the water , or the Ascension may not be literally , physically , historically true  --  and yet do tell , symbolically , profound and life-giving truths : Jesus came not only for poor and unschooled Jewish peasants but for wealthy and learned gentiles as well ; if we keep our eyes on Jesus and not only on our own limitations , we can do what we thought impossible ; Jesus went into another dimension of existence that surpassed the four dimensions we are able to perceive , a dimension in which we , too , exist here and now . For centuries , Scripture had been poetry analyzed by accountants who were forgetting that it was written by men and women trying to awaken us from a dead-end world of nothing but the physical . In all our dealings with the divine , we are treating what William James described with admirable caution and irritating lack of specificity : " What we may call " something there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special and particular " senses . ' ' " Scripture offers **30;95;TOOLONG answers to questions for which there are no terminal answers , about which we can forever continue to find more and more without ever achieving closure . They evoke mysteries . Today we are more laudably humble before the mysterious real in Scripture , at peace with the limitations of human perceptions , categories and formulations . TRADITION . In contrast , to the minds of many Catholics , especially many in authority in the church , tradition is rooted in stone : Roma locuta , causa finita ( " Rome has spoken , the case is closed " ) , a mind-set that argues that once the Vatican has given an answer to a question  --  whether from the pope ex cathedra , in an encyclical or any other communication or through any office of his curia  --  the loyal Catholic must yield will and judgment , even though the pronouncement contradicts everything else he or she knows to be true from psychology , biology , physics , whatever . To that mind-set , denial  --  or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heterodoxy , if not heresy . As Bishop Kenneth Untener wrote in Commonweal ( 6/18 ) : " In the eyes of many people , the teaching church has committed a teacher 's cardinal sin : It has become more concerned about itself than about the truth . " He expands that insight into an apt analogy to maps drawn by early explorers that , over time , were changed and improved by later investigation . The terrain did n't change , but the maps did . But he continues : " The terrain no longer appears to be our issue . Our map is the issue . " But the official church 's pronouncements have indeed been not only out of focus but dead wrong  --  demonstrably , frequently and from the start . Most often ( though it may take a century or more , and though it rarely if ever comes forth as an open admission of error ) , the Spirit brings the church to its senses and it corrects the error . But not always . Peter , the first pope , changed his mind radically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith : circumcision and the dietary laws . Under the persuasive arguments of Paul , Peter admitted one did not have to become a Jew before becoming an authentic Christian . Paul himself gradually realized he had been wrong taking Jesus literally about an imminent end of the world . Although he himself never seemed to have seen it clearly , we can now see Paul was wrong in his tolerance of slavery . Though he exhorted slaves to serve their masters in fear and trembling : and sent the slave Onesimus back to Philemon , he was wrong  --  just as Augustine was wrong in believing slavery was an expression of the divine order . What on earth gives me the right to challenge an apostle and a father of the church ? The objective facts . For centuries church laws against Jews made them subhuman pariahs in society ( however wealthy , learned , generous or pious ) . They excommunicated Christians who ate with Jews ( though Jesus had ) and dismissed interfaith marriages as fornication . It was not till Vatican II that Catholics stopped referring to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , schismatic , infidel and perfidious , " respectively . Even the Good Friday liturgy had " prayed " for " animas diabolica fraude deceptas , haeretica pravitate deposita " ( " souls deceived by hellish fraud , engendered by heretical depravity " ) . Vatican II offered at least a tacit apology for centuries of inhumane error . The church was not only wrong but gravely so in instituting and supporting the sale of indulgences , the Inquisition and the crusades . No doubt much of 19th-century liberalism was riddled with crude scientism and a naive belief in the myth of progress , but Pius IX 's response , the Syllabus of Errors , was an anti-human document that condemned civil education , freedom of speech , press and religion , even moderate rationalism , Bible societies , liberal clerical groups  --  in short , challenge and growth . It imprisoned the church in a dungeon of anti-intellectualism , retrogression and suspicion for 100 years until the gates were swung by the humane Pope John XXIII , who himself had been under suspicion of modernism when teaching at Bergamo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Galileo case . Such hesitance to admit mistakes not only does not succeed in shoring up the church 's unchallengeable authority but actually undermines it . It also subverts the church 's claim that honest confession and resolve to amend are good for the souls of its members . THE YEN FOR CERTITUDE . When I was studying what I then believed was philosophy ( in Latin ) , I was mystified by what seemed celestial calculus . One thorny thesis in particular had 23 sub-distinctions , and prying them apart left me feeling like Psyche sorting seeds . Thus , for a final term paper , I wrote about an article in the Summa in which Aquinas argued that all philosophy must ultimately be grounded in the concrete realities of life , and I borrowed heavily from Cardinal Newman 's The Grammar of Assent and Essay on the Development of Doctrine . When I got a C for the paper , I asked the teacher of the course about it . His reply was terse : " Cardinal Newman was not a philosopher or a theologian . " My numb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " What the professor had meant , of course , was that Cardinal Newman was not a scholastic philosopher or theologian . The need for brain-surgeon precision and certitude in our attempts to comprehend the ultimately incomprehensible has been with us since the very first . It was what Adam and Eve were looking for , eating from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil : " Eat this and you will become like God . " Equivalently , you will be your own masters ; you wo n't need God ; you will be certain . Such a desire for certitude and control is , of course , unwitting blasphemy . Oedipus , Faust , Hitler suffered few doubts . Nor has the church been free of that need to dominate rather than submit to the truth  --  especially to the truth of our own limited minds . Take only two cases typical of many . On Saturday , July 16 , 1054 , just before the chanting of the afternoon liturgy , the delegate of the Roman pope strode into the Church of Santa Sophia in Constantinople @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Eastern emperor and all their followers , and then departed , symbolically shaking the dust from his feet . Ostensibly , the major doctrinal focus was the East 's refusal to accept the word filioque ( " and from the Son " ) into the Creed . The word embodied the West 's belief that the Holy Spirit did not proceed directly from the Father  --  as the Son did  --  but from the Father and the Son . The East was willing to settle for " through " the Son , but refused to " denigrate " the all-powerful Spirit to such a seemingly inferior position . Thus , one half the Christian church split away from the other , each arguing that the other half was in schism from itself . Over a single word , which the majority of believers  --  at least today  --  knew nothing about , could not explain and could n't care less about . Truth to tell , however , the schism between Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy came about because of a welter of forces that show that the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to the Western as well : politics , social and cultural antagonisms , territory in particular and domination in general , not to mention vendetta and greed . But arrogant certitudes on both sides kept Christians from realizing that what united them was far more important than the precisions that divided them . Yet the excuse was purity of doctrine , much as in Northern Ireland today the excuse is the supremacy of the pope . A second example : Charles V ( whose main motive was the reunification of Germany , not Christian doctrine ) assembled representatives of Rome , Luther , Melanchthon , Calvin and Zwingli and begged them to agree Jesus was at least " somehow " present more really in the Eucharist than in any other place . No . Luther believed ardently in the real presence ; Zwingli held for a mere symbol ; Calvin was somewhere between the two . The motives for recalcitrance were not doctrine but dominance . To by far the majority of Christians  --  in any of the camps  --  the points at issue were mere theological lint-picking . Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put mysteries into formulas fall short and , at the end of his life , that all his insights into God were " straw " compared to the Reality . For a short time , the Christian way was not dialectic but persuasion , not an attempt to out-argue the opposition  --  much less to silence or excommunicate her or him from dialogue . Jesus ' own parable of the wheat and the weeds declared unequivocally that if evil can not be uprooted without harm to the good , then we must tolerate the " evil . " We do not throw out the bent reed or quench the smoldering flax . Could anyone be converted  --  or sustained in conversion  --  by an anathema ? I am by no means belittling intellectual investigation of the truths of the faith . I am questioning what can become a tyranny of intellect over the heart . All our theologizing must be checked by appeal back to Christ himself . And conversion  --  a complete reversal of goals and values  --  stands at the heart of Jesus ' message , not intellectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Reverently , no doubt , did the apostles consecrate the Eucharist , yet if they were asked about the terminus a quo and the terminus ad quem , about transubstantiation , about the differences existing in Christ 's body in heaven , on the cross , and in the sacrament of the Eucharist , about the moment when transubstantiation takes place ... they would not , I deem , have answered with the same acuteness that the Scotists display in their dissertations and definitions . What we call the Apostles ' Creed was n't written by the Apostles , and they would probably have been mystified if asked to explain its various parts . Yet somehow they managed to begin a movement that has lasted two millennia . Beyond that , what the honest , intelligent Catholic wants is a study of theological and moral doctrine that focuses somewhere between patriarchal ( or fundamentalist ) certitude on the one hand and existential angst on the other . TRADITION AND EVOLUTION . Like oak roots under pavement , there are more than a few natural forces working inexorably  --  however slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tradition 's promise of security can forever resist the needs of the human spirit . The objective configuration of the cosmos forced the church , after centuries , to realize we had to go back and completely revise our certitudes about Scripture , from Eden to the Ascension to the nature of heaven and hell . The objective nature of human beings must force us to accept that no one , not even the church , can legitimately treat humans like cattle or adults like children . What father would want his children to remain infants  --  much less sheep ? The will of God , manifest endlessly in nature and Scripture , is for growth , change , renewal . Creation moved from inanimate to vegetative to animal to human . The two Testaments show God coming back again and again , saying , " All right , now let 's start over , better this time . " The whole Gospel message  --  culminating on Easter Sunday  --  is rebirth . Not merely change but metanoia : total reversal of our certitudes and expectations . In his inaugural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desert , Jesus announced His intentions , not only for His own public ministry but for the church : " The Spirit of the Lord is upon me , because he has chosen me to bring good news to the poor . He has sent me to proclaim liberty to captives and recovery of sight to the blind , to set free the oppressed and announce the amnesty of God " ( Lk. 4:18-19 ) . And in John 's Gospel , Jesus says : " If you obey my teaching , you are really my disciples ; you will know the truth , and the truth will set you free " ( 8:31-2 ) . The objective truth  --  however unnerving and challenging to our former certitudes  --  can never harm genuine Christianity . Throughout its history , the teaching church learned from non-Catholic sources initially held suspect : Plato , Aristotle and their Muslim commentators . It learned slowly to rethink and understand itself better from those who challenged her : Galileo , Luther , Freud , Darwin , Protestant biblical critics . In contrast , documents like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feminism and socialism or Marxism . To some apologists the church is most secure proving herself by herself . They would have us follow Dostoevsky 's Grand Inquisitor , who said to Jesus Himself in the story : I tell you man has no more agonizing anxiety than to find someone to whom he can hand over , with all speed , the gift of freedom with which the unhappy creature is born .... Instead of the strict ancient law , man had in future to decide for himself with a free heart what is good and what is evil , having only your image before him for guidance .... We have corrected your great work and have based it on miracle , mystery and authority . And men rejoiced that they were once again led like sheep and that the terrible gift which had brought them so much suffering had at last been lifted from their hearts . " HAVING ONLY YOUR IMAGE BEFORE HIM FOR GUIDANCE . " Although free of sin , the Jesus we find in the Gospel had a truly remarkable empathy for sinners and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sinner not just seven times but seventy times seven times . The picture He gives of God in the story of the Prodigal Father shows that God  --  and all who take God 's place  --  are out watching for the wanderers every evening so that they can see them from afar and run to embrace them . They do n't demand an accounting of every shekel wasted before allowing the errant to return . They do n't give a penance ; they give a party ! " My son who was dead is alive again ! " In Jesus " hierarchy of vices , sexual faults do not seem to be near the top . He does not probe the adulterous woman 's conscience for species and number ; He merely refuses to condemn her and tells her not to sin again . With the Samaritan woman at the well , Jesus is almost cavalier : " You are right when you say you do not have a husband . You have been married to five men , and the man you live with now is not really your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4:17-18 ) . But Jesus does not pursue that ; rather He goes on to more important things , like bringing the woman 's soul alive again with living water . Jesus never spoke of homosexuality or masturbation , or if He did no one thought it important enough to remember and preserve . When He spoke of divorce , He regarded it as a betrayal of a promise between two people rather than an insult to the procreative process . Although Jesus was ( in our terms ) a " layman " in His religion , He did n't hesitate to make a quite dramatic statement in clearing out the Temple with no more than a handful of rope and His own towering rage . He did not hesitate to " correct " Moses himself . Jesus never strongly rebuked a sexual sinner ; in fact , the only sinners He did rail against  --  fiercely  --  were the clergy , the hypocrisy of the priests of His own religion and the materialist ambitions of His own future priests . " They tie on people 's backs loads that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing even to lift a finger to help them carry those loads .... The greatest one among you must be your servant " ( Mt . 23:4 , 11 ) . DISPUTED QUESTIONS . Not being a professional theologian nor a Vatican official , I am not empowered to give secure answers to certain questions that trouble me . But I am empowered to raise the questions , even ill-advised ones , as Peter , James and John and their mother , and Thomas did to Jesus . Since Jesus , when asked who is the first in the Kingdom , raised up a child , I wonder what Jesus would say about the need for infant baptism  --  at least when that is understood to relieve the burden of sin from a person as yet incapable of responsibility even for toilet habits . Since He worked in a culture where it was unthinkable for a woman to be an expert in the Law , not to mention being a priest , I wonder if the Jesus who chose women as the privileged first witnesses of His resurrection would have chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of the Last Supper wrongly , Jesus gave Communion to Judas , even knowing what he was about to do , which makes me wonder how Jesus would react to someone who sought Communion but was of another Christian denomination or divorced and remarried . I wonder what the Jesus who dealt so blithely with the much-wed Samaritan woman would say about the relative claims of the functions of ova and sperm against those of two loving , good-souled and committed people . I am even tempted to wonder what Jesus would say to two lifelong companions of the same sex who must live a life they surely would not have chosen for themselves . There is a story about the cardinal secretary of state rushing breathlessly into the pope 's office : " Good news and bad news ! " he cries . " The good news : Jesus is coming back ! The bad news : He 's coming back in Salt Lake City ! " Were Jesus to come back today , He would not expect the bush to look even remotely like the mustard seed He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . I guess that 's , more or less , pretty much , what I had in mind . All right , now let 's .... " William J. O'Malley , S.J. , has just published Why Be Catholic ?
