Do n't panic . <p> When left-wing radicals in Berlin pelted both the unpopular Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the highly respected President Richard von Weizsacker with tomatoes , eggs , and paint bombs at a November 8 rally protesting racist attacks against foreigners , it was hard to overlook the parallels with the turbulence of Germany 's past . Earlier in the week Kohl had warned that he might invoke a state of emergency should the Social Democrats block a bill amending Germany 's constitutional guarantee of asylum  --  a move that revived memories of how emergency decrees during the Weimar Republic , designed to save constitutional government , helped only to bring it down . The debacle in Berlin seemed to demonstrate that the Federal Republic was caught between right-wing thugs who were assaulting foreigners and Jews and left-wing radicals protesting those assaults . A belated immune response to the postwar implant of liberal democracy was taking shape in the wake of ugly nationalist and ethnic upsurges in the east . <p> Or was it ? The Federal Republic faces huge problems , but they lie less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the major parties to confront the dislocations brought on by the waves of immigrants streaming into Germany . Until now leading German politicians have exploited rather than confronted the immigration problem . This lack of political will has exacerbated the already enormous difficulties of getting the former Communist East on its feet . Prompted by the ghastly bombing in Mlln of a Turkish woman and two children in late November , Bonn belatedly moved to ban neo-Nazi groups and to create a special federal police force to crack down on the right . Considering the massive economic and social upheaval that German unification has set into motion , however , the relative smoothness of the transformation is far more remarkable than the violent outbursts that attract media attention . <p> This is not the first time that the FRG has had to face down the radical right and left . In the early 1950s unreconstructed Nazis formed and infiltrated political parties ; by 1956 both the Communist and Nazi parties were outlawed and effectively defanged . In 1966 a national Socialist Party flickered into existence in Hesse ; there was much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' 70s the small Baader-Meinhof " Red Army Faction , " which could count on a larger number of personally non-violent sympathizers , organized a wave of terrorist attacks intended to provoke government repression so drastic that it would lead to a popular uprising . The threat to public order seemed so great that Chancellor Helmut Schmidt nearly resorted to emergency powers . Like now , frightening parallels with the Weimar Enabling Act were invoked . Schmidt smashed the network by letting the police operate on the fringes of the legally permissible . The feeling of democratic government under siege that the radical left aroused during the ' 70s comes closest to the apprehensions felt today . <p> The ' 80s brought new violence . Left-wing radicals calling themselves Autonome periodically rampaged through Berlin , Hamburg , and other major cities , looting stores and burning cars . And terrorist activity sporadically continued . In October 1989 Alfred Herrhausen , the head of Deutsche Bank , was blown to bits by a terrorist-planted bomb ; and in 1991 Detlev Rohwedder , the head of the Treuhandanstalt , the government agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The appearance of radicals at the Berlin rally should thus have come as no surprise . Yet the furious noise they make ca n't disguise that they are a spent force . <p> The late ' 80s saw a resurgence on the right . The former S.S. man Franz Schnhuber launched his Republikaner Party by skillfully tapping a vein of resentment against asylum-seekers from Turkey and Africa . Anti-Semitism was never far from the surface ; Republikaner meetings , filled with burly men wearing armbands , resurrected Nazi symbols . The " Reps , " as they are known , won a remarkable 7.5 percent of the vote in Berlin 's municipal elections in January 1989 and garnered 7.2 percent in elections to the European Parliament . When the Berlin Wall crumbled in November 1989 , so did the Reps . Failing to overcome the 5 percent threshold for entry into the Bundestag in the December 1990 national elections , they fell into bickering and recriminations . But with the fresh influx of asylum-seekers since the middle of 1990 , their numbers have again begun to swell , especially in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People 's Union in the socialist stronghold of Bremen won the votes of disaffected SPD supporters angered by the party 's support of asylum . The SPD 's share of the vote plummeted from 51 percent to 38 percent . <p> Along with electoral gains came almost daily attacks against asylum-seekers , providing the most spectacular evidence of a growing nationalist fervor . The attacks began in 1990 and reached a crescendo the following year in Hoyerswerda , where local citizens cheered on youths attacking a home sheltering refugees from Vietnam and Mozambique . In August marauding skinheads in Rostock firebombed an asylum home and battled with woefully undermanned and ill-equipped police . <p> The attacks on foreigners are , of course , despicable ; but German anger at the flood of immigrants is not entirely unfounded . In the past year 368,536 people have sought asylum in Germany , in addition to the 173,746 so-called ethnic Germans from Russia who enjoy automatic citizenship . Even Schmidt , a moderate socialist , has observed that " no people in the world would put up with half a million foreigners coming in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population of 80 million , has accepted almost 1 million refugees in the past two years ; the United States , with a population of 260 million , accepts only 700,000 legal immigrants per year . What 's more , Germany has taken in 200,000 Yugoslavian refugees ; France , Italy , and Switzerland have accepted only token numbers , the United States has agreed to harbor only 1,000 Bosnians , and the British refused even to take the 175 Bosnian refugees stranded at the Austrian border in mid-November . This year Germany has received 60 percent of all requests for asylum in the European Community . Exasperated by the refusal of other e.c . countries to accept refugees , Bonn has even pledged $45 million to building homes for the half million refugees stranded in Croatia . <p> What angers Germans further is that the vast majority of non-Yugoslavian refugees seeking asylum in Germany are not fleeing persecution . Rather , they are attracted by Germany 's generous social system and the ease of entry under the country 's asylum law . A cumbersome instrument , it generally takes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's case . Forbidden by law to work , refugees awaiting the settlement of their cases are provided 960 deutsche marks per month by the German government , in addition to free housing and meals . On average , the government spends $10,000 a year for each refugee . These benefits are so attractive that some would-be refugees pay gangs to smuggle them into Germany . ( The irony , of course , is that it is precisely because of their newfound freedoms that Eastern Europeans can leave their own countries and appear in Germany as supplicants . ) One outraged German woman told me that her granddaughter had had to wait two years for a spot in a kindergarten in Trier , while the daughter of a Gypsy family was immediately placed in the same classroom . " Refugees from Yugoslavia who are in distress are one thing , " she said . " But when something like this with my granddaughter occurs  --  then I see red ! " <p> The much-publicized German animus toward the Gypsies is more than an expression of atavistic prejudices : according to German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centrist coalition party , the Free Democrats , many of the Romanian Gypsies who travel to Germany are smuggled in by gangs . A startling 56 percent , said Schfer , have committed crimes , and some serve as advance men for the criminal networks that the Italian Mafia is establishing in eastern Germany . " As long as the war in Yugoslavia continues , we will continue to take on refugees , " he added , but with regard to refugees from other countries the patience and purses of the local districts in Germany are close to the breaking point . <p> Indeed , given the economic squeeze that the move to a market system has wrought in the East , the growth of resentment toward foreigners is not surprising . The official unemployment rate in eastern Germany is around 17 percent , but actual unemployment hovers between 40 percent and 60 percent . In July the mayor of Kalbe , a village in the state of Mecklenburg , told me that 60 percent of the locals are on the dole . Many older workers have resigned themselves to permanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bonn is running Reaganesque budget deficits , the transfer payments in the past three years to the East amount to 400 billion deutsche marks , the growth in GNP has slowed to a pitiful 0.5 percent , and , despite high interest rates , inflation continues to run at 3.6 percent . <p> And yet , economic difficulties alone do not begin to account for the current German distemper . The uproar over immigrants can be traced above all to the political ineptitude of both major parties . Kohl will go down in history as the chancellor who managed to unite Germany but not the Germans . Eastern and western Germans have never been so bitterly divided . Grossly underestimating the difficulties that unification would present , Kohl took a Bush-like stand against taxes and assured his new constituents that the country would immediately blossom . " No one will be worse off for unification , " he vowed . In so doing , Kohl squandered an opportunity to encourage West Germans to shoulder the burden of unity and betrayed the hopes of East Germans . The cheers that formerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to jeers . <p> But the SPD bears almost as much responsibility for the current impasse as Kohl 's CDU . The breach in the Wall in 1989 left the party in a state of political shock ; many SPD members had clung to the illusion that East Germany might provide a possible " Third Way " between capitalism and communism . This paralysis , combined with Kohl 's abdication of leadership on the immigration issue , has provided maneuvering room for the far right . Fortunately , Kohl and Bjrn Engholm , the leader of the SPD , who courageously forced a change in the party 's platform at the November special party congress in Bonn , have begun to work out their differences over an asylum law . A compromise on a change in this law may be reached by the end of this year 's legislative period . The change is badly needed . At the moment , immigration into Germany is impossible ; entry is possible only as a candidate for asylum . A sensible law would establish immigration quotas , restrict the numbers of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow the French model of jus soli rather than jus sanguinis . The present German nationality law is based on a 1913 Wilhelmine law that defines nationality by blood . An ethnic German whose ancestors immigrated to Russia in the 1760s therefore has an automatic right to citizenship ; a third-generation Turk who speaks flawless German has none . <p> Regulating the immigration problem and initiating a crackdown on right-wing extremists should go a long way toward allaying fears that the FRG is heading the way of Weimar . The Germans have not responded to the recent outrages by turning to police state methods , and the memories of Schmidt 's dubious constitutional measures in the ' 70s have served as a cautionary tale for Germany today . Bonn 's bungled response to the foreigners flooding into the country , then , is no cause for panic . <p> By Jacob Heilbrunn <p> <p> Jacob Heilbrunn is University Fellow at the Center for German and European Studies , Georgetown University . <p>                    @
