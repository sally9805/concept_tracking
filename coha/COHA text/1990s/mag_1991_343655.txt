A bulwark against despair , a sanctuary of freedom , a subversive counterforce  --  during a decade of struggle against communist control , the Roman Catholic Church in Poland was all that and more , depending on the viewpoint . Its representatives stood courageously alongside the Solidarity trade union and suffered the consequences , when Father Jerzy Popieluszko , an activist priest , was murdered by government security agents in 1984 . When the struggle ended in 1989 with a Solidarity-led government , the church emerged triumphant , solidly allied with an administration it had all but installed . <P> A year later , the church , to which 97% of Poland 's 38 million people belong , is omnipresent and , in the view of some , virtually omnipotent . Bishops and priests bless the armed forces , schools and factories . The newly created post of superior chaplain to the army has been given the rank of general . To mark the 200th anniversary of the country 's first liberal constitution earlier this month , President Lech Walesa , a devout Catholic , skipped ceremonies at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madonna at Jasna Gora . <P> Beyond such symbolic gestures , the church is exercising direct political influence in an often fractious country that has just begun to build democracy . Last August , after lobbying by church officials , the government introduced optional religious instruction in schools by administrative fiat rather than parliamentary vote . A poll released last week shows that the church is perceived as the single most powerful national institution , stronger than the government , the presidency , the military , the old communist nomenklatura and even Solidarity . The church 's ascendancy has left many Poles uneasily wondering whether their country might someday be transformed into a clerical state , ruling in accordance with the dicta of Pope John Paul II ( who makes his fourth papal visit to his native country next month ) . <P> Recent statements by the Polish Episcopate have fueled apprehension . In late April the bishops urged that the new constitution exclude any provision for the separation of church and state . Instead , they suggested , " exceptional emphasis should be laid on the need for cooperation between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church 's gravest concerns  --  and most assiduous efforts  --  center on abortion , a volatile issue in a country where as many as 600,000 such procedures are performed each year . A liberal abortion law , which has been on the books since 1956 , is still in effect , but the Senate has passed a bill that would impose a prison term of as much as two years on anyone performing the procedure unless the pregnancy threatened the mother 's life or stemmed from rape or incest . Several variants on that bill , many of them even stiffer , are being considered by the Sejm , the lower house , which is due to vote this week on whether to submit the question to a national referendum . Earlier this month , the bishops ' conference condemned that option . Meanwhile , the government has ended subsidies for birth-control pills . That move , which many suspect was church inspired , will triple the price of pills , putting them beyond the reach of many women .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
