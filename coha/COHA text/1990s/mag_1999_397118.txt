Section : Humachines In Japan , a cartoon inspired a generation of engineers to make machines that look  --  and act  --  human . <p> Bolted onto a two-wheeled trolley , with a tiny square head , pink shoulder pads and outsize metal claws , Hadaly-2 does n't look much like a human being . But behavior is another story : Shine a light in this robot 's eyes and it will squint , blink and turn away in a strikingly humanlike manner . Created at Tokyo 's Waseda University , Hadaly-2 is among the latest manifestations of Japan 's unique obsession with friendly humanoid robots . <p> Although Japanese technical leadership in the area of mechanical folk dates to the 1970s , " there 's been a big burst of energy during the last three years , " according to Rodney Brooks , a roboticist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . <p> Brooks was one of the U.S. researchers who visited Tsukuba Science City northeast of Tokyo last October for the first International Workshop on Humanoid and Friendly Robotics . There , Waseda engineers wowed crowds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can recognize seven human gestures including " Hello , " " Good-bye , " " Come here " and " Go away . " Two dozen presentations from other top universities and big corporate labs revealed a Japanese research establishment intent on endowing robots with the realistic motions , simulated emotions and interpersonal skills needed to move them off the factory floor and into people 's homes and offices . <p> The current android craze was touched off in late 1996 when Honda Motor Corp . unveiled a bipedal humanoid dubbed " P-2 . " The product of a secret 10-year , $100 million research effort , Honda 's 250 kg creation resembles a space-suited astronaut . A backpack full of batteries made P-2 the first humanoid robot able to walk autonomously , without a power or control cord . <p> Stunning videos of P-2 climbing stairs and giving flowers to young girls caused a drama in the Japanese press and spurred Japan 's Ministry of International Trade and Industry ( MITI ) to launch a five-year national Humanoid Robot R &D; Project . Honda will produce a dozen or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consortium of university and government engineers to use as a test bed to develop android applications , including entertainment and disaster rescue . The budget for the project 's first year  --  the only figure currently available  --  is around $8 million . <p> Japan 's big push for human simulacra leaves Western observers with one nagging question , says Australian National University roboticist Alex Zelinsky : " Why ? " The answer is simple , say Japanese researchers . They were inspired by a cartoon . <p> Tetsuwan Atomu , Mighty Atom , the creation of Osamu Tezuka , made his debut in 1951 . Mighty Atom stories ran in comic book form for the next 18 years , and beginning in 1963 the hugely popular character also starred in Japan 's first animated TV series ( later exported under the name of Astro Boy ) . <p> In Western culture , robots are typically viewed as slaves that when given intelligence and human qualities will respond by challenging their human masters for supremacy . Think " The Terminator " or the murderous replicants in " Blade Runner . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Depicted as a little boy with huge eyes and spiky hair , Mighty Atom helped humanity by fighting monsters and bandits in the name of peace . In his exhaustive and entertaining analysis of the Japanese preoccupation with robotics , Inside the Robot Kingdom , Fred Schodt writes that Mighty Atom was forever " striving to become more human ( i.e. , emotive and illogical ) , and also to be an interface between two different cultures  --  that of man and that of machine ... over the years in the public mind , he  --  and robots-became linked with a wonderful future that science and technology could provide . " <p> Thanks to Mighty Atom , says Takanori Shibata , a researcher at MITI 's Mechanical Engineering Laboratory in Tsukuba , " Japanese people have very positive impressions of humanoid robots ; they think humanoid robots always help humans . " <p> While they may take their inspiration from comic strips , Japan 's robot researchers are no idle fantasists . Rather , they exhibit a very Japanese emphasis on applications , such as caring for Japan 's rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in four Japanese will be over 65 . ) " In such a society , " Kazuo Tanie and Hideo Tsukune , the co-chairmen of the Tsukuba Workshop wrote in their foreword to the conference proceedings , " we suppose that there are some needs for robots that can support the daily life of the elderly . " Possible tasks include housework , remote diagnosis via a network , or rehabilitation  --  such as helping stroke sufferers to walk . <p> Friendly humanoid robots , Japanese researchers believe , will be best suited to sharing the physical and emotional environment of the home . Take Hadaly-2 's bashful blinking . It is part of what engineers with Waseda 's Humanoid Project term an " emotional man-machine environment interaction . " Launched in 1992 , Waseda 's project now involves more than 60 researchers in seven labs working on key communication technologies that will permit robots and people to cohabit . In addition to an anthropomorphic head-eye system capable of rapid movement , the Waseda teams are combining voice recognition software and speech synthesizers to give robots conversation skills . At nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kobayashi have created a robot whose vision system lets it identify human emotions such as surprise , fear , happiness and disgust . A motorized mask allows the machine to respond with grimaces or smiles of its own . <p> Friendly robots also come on four legs . Last June , Sony 's D-21 laboratory announced that it had constructed a 15-cm-tall robot dog capable of doing cute tricks , such as falling over and getting up again , in response to visual cues from a human operator . Toshoi Doi , Sony corporate vice president and president of Sony Computer Science Laboratories , believes such " entertainment robots " will create " a new industry " for emotionally gratifying mechanical playthings , a prediction that gained credence with the news that two other large Japanese electronics firms , Omron and Matsushita , had come up with robot cats . <p> Omron 's electromechanical feline relies on physical contact rather than vision to interact with people . Via five tactile sensors and three microswitches located on its head and body , the cat can recognize touching , stroking and hitting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important in human-machine interaction , " says MITI 's Shibata , who helped Omron build the robot . Omron , Shibata says , wants " to introduce pet robots as a kind of tool for the healing of the human mind , to give some relaxation to people who interact with the robot . " <p> Mighty Atom would undoubtedly have approved . <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : " Animated-face robot " ( left , above ) at the Science University of Tokyo shown with and without its skin . A CCD camera in the robot 's left eye detects facial expressions of nearby humans . Pneumatic actuator-motors in the face allow it to respond with one of six different expressions . Advanced " shape memory " actuators in the next-generation robot ( right ) are visible when illuminated by a penlight ( top ) . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : WE-3R : ( above ) The mobile lips , eyebrows and lidded eyes of this anthropomorphic face robot at Waseda University can express happiness , sadness and fear based on sensory inputs . WE-3R can follow a light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the head . The dozens of engineers who work on Waseda 's Humanoid Project regularly cannibalize their creations:WE-3R 's innards previously belonged to a robot named Hadaly-2 . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : WABIAN-RII : ( opposite page ) Waseda Bipedal Humanoid-Refined can walk shakily and dance with its human operator . WABIAN is a study in key technologies that will allow robots to support humans physically and emotionally . Applications include caring for the elderly . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Honda P-3 : ( above ) Inside a classified R &D; facility , a technician commands Honda 's P-3 android via telemetry . The 130-kilogram , 1.6-meter-tall robot can walk at up to 2 km/hr and climb stairs . A vision system that allows it to navigate around furniture is a step towards Honda 's goal of a humanoid robot that can " coexist and cooperate with human beings . " <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Biped Locomotion Robot : ( opposite page , top ) At Nagoya University 's Fukuda Lab , evolutionary algorithms help robots learn how to walk using minimal energy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human toddler  --  a graduate student prepares a helping hand in case of a stumble .
