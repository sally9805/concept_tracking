<p> U-turns , half-truths , philosophical pirouettes , and shoddy reporting : Is the Wall Street Journal 's editorial page shell shocked or simply out of its mind ? <p> Two weeks and a day after becoming a lame duck , George Bush was flipping through the morning 's Wall Street Journal when an editorial caught his eye . Headlined " EPA 's Most Wanted , " it was about a man named Bill Ellen " who is about to go to prison for violating the federal government 's wetlands policy . " <p> Ellen was an engineer working on the Eastern Shore spread of Paul Tudor Jones II , the Wall Street trading whiz . In 1987 , Ellen began building a 100-acre " wildlife sanctuary " on Jones ' property . Since the sanctuary was to be built on wetlands , Ellen , according to the Journal , " was careful to work with officials from the Soil Conservation Service and the Army Corps of Engineers and secured 38 permits for the work . " <p> " Then , in 1989 , the federal government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ net loss ' of wetlands , issued a new manual redefining them . " Armed with the new definition , the Corps declared Ellen 's project a wetland and ordered him to stop work  --  which he did , according to the Journal , in February 1989 . But a couple of days later , he allowed two truckloads of dirt to be dumped in a " duck pond . " The feds later indicted Ellen and Jones . Jones pled guilty to filling wetlands , and paid $2 million in fines and restitution ; a jury convicted Ellen , and he was sentenced to six months in jail . <p> " No one is safe from an overzealous government enforcement campaign that treats all things wet as equal , " the Journal declared . " At a time when drug dealers and other criminals often escape with no jail time , this Vietnam combat veteran ca n't understand why he must go to prison over a bureaucrat 's interpretation of an ambiguous congressional law . " The paper called on Bush to pardon Ellen . <p> Disturbed by this Kaflkaesque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to review Ellen 's case to see whether a pardon might be justified . <p> Weeks passed , but no pardon came down . The Journal published a handful of letters supporting Ellen and expressing outrage at the government 's conduct . Apparently there was no space to print rebutting letters from the prosecutor , Maryland U.S. Attorney Breckenridge Willcox , or his successor , Richard Bennett . <p> On January 15 , the Journal revisited the matter in a lead editorial titled " The Ellen Pardon , " a guns-blazing broadside against federal wetlands law  --  all of it . Then Bush went , Clinton came , and Bill Ellen sat in jail . <p> A miscarriage of justice ? Not exactly . What Boyden Gray had quickly discovered was that the Journal 's account of Ellen 's case , apparently based on conversations with his lawyers , bore only the slightest resemblance to the truth . For starters , the " sanctuary " was a hunting lodge . Ellen had n't violated some bureaucratic " manual , " but the Clean Water Act of 1972 . He was convicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a tidal creek , something which has been illegal since the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1898 . All told , Ellen had filled or altered close to 1,000 acres , though the prosecution focused on areas that were indisputably ( wet ; the new wetlands definition was n't even an issue . <p> Worse , Ellen had ignored three cut-it-out orders from the Army Corps , the first of which came in 1988 , not 1989 . That convinced a Jury , and the Fourth Circuit U. S. Court of Appeals , that he certainly did know he was breaking the law . Furthermore , this was no rogue prosecution , but one that had been approved at the highest levels of Justice . <p> It 's remarkable that the Journal would end the Reagan-Bush years on such an ignominious note . The paper 's editorial page had practically set the table for the supply-side feast , and it remained a key forum for Republican policymakers and conservative intellectuals throughout Bush 's term . Beginning in the mid-1970s , the Journal 's Jude Wanniski published column after column on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a joke of the economics world into official policy  --  a feat to rival William Randolph Hearst 's instigation of the Spanish-American War in 1898 . The Journal also midwifed Star Wars , supply-side 's military counterpart . <p> The degree to which the Journal has shaped public policy is even more impressive when you consider that since Hearst 's day , the typical editorial page has withered to an impotent nub . Back then , the editorial page em bodied and expressed a newspaper 's soul . It was the designated free-fire zone where scores were settled and skirmishes provoked in thunderous copy that would traumatize today 's fragile sensibilities . Now , it survives as a gangrenous appendage of that dying beast , the daily newspaper . The editorial pages of even the greatest papers in the land are little more than repositories of conventional wisdom , grindstones for dull axes . <p> By comparison , the Journal is a geyser . As pungently conservative as its peers are blandly liberal , as combative as they are gun-shy , the Journal harks back without shame to the age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many plucked from conservative college rags like The Dartmouth Review , will leave no sacred liberal cow ungored . Taking full advantage of their anonymity , they regularly drub liberals , errant and otherwise . It 's probably the only newspaper in America that would urge a new president to " bomb Congress . " <p> Supervising this Journalistic Delta House is Robert Bartley , who for 21 years has held the title of Editor , editing a page and a half of commentary plus another of arts . When he took the reins in 1972 , Bartley transformed the editorial page from a sleepy purveyor of blue-chip conservatism into an aggressive , illustrious neoconservative forum . His own lack of formal economics training did not hinder him from winning a Pulitzer in 1980 for his supply-side commentary . <p> The page takes intellectual guidance from a board of contributors gleaming with luminaries such as Paul Craig Roberts and Arthur Schlesinger , Jr. ; its guru and godfather is Irving Kristol . Almost all outside contributors share the basic views of Bartley and his youthful staff ; regular liberal columnists Alexander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phased out in 1991 . Today the page serves as the right 's exclusive bulletin board . If it sometimes seems like a tired reciter of the conservative line  --  its obsessions with term limits and the capital gains tax are beyond tedious  --  remember that it helped to redraw that line . <p> Bartley , who started at the Journal as a bureau reporter , also helped invent a new genre , the reported editorial . Where editorialists at other papers content themselves with gumming over yesterday 's headlines , the Journal 's eager-beavers actually make phone calls , digging up stories on a range of subjects . Nothing is too trivial or obscure , if it can be properly spun to fit the Journal 's worldview . So , to pick a random example , the plight of the Great Circus Bim Bom , a Russian troupe which chose to remain stranded and broke in the U.S. rather than return home , permitted the page to take a dig at Gorbachev ( in mid-1990 ) : " We guess this means that even zero dollars are still worth more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what editorials are , " Bartley told a newly hired Jude Wanniski in 1972 , according to Sidney Blumenthal in The Rise of the Counter-Establishment . " The ideology finds the news . " Ideo-logic <p> The ideology seems to fluctuate between free-market libertarianism , the Republican platform , and a kind of neo-Victorian prudery ( some of the funniest pieces deal with sex ) . Imagine Ayn Rand as a GOP operative and you get the picture . Bartley 's principal innovation is to adopt the techniques of lefty agitprop , which he then trains upon the left , a tactic rather like fighting Amazon tribesmen with curare-tipped darts . What do liberals want to do ? Help the downtrodden , especially minorities . So the Journal promotes welfare reform as a way to help blacks out of poverty ; it touts NAFTA because free trade will help Mexicans . Welfare fans and NAFTA foes , it implies , are racist . <p> And rather than red-bait its ideological opponents , the Journal sticks them with leftism 's favorite epithets . When Clarence Thomas was named to the federal bench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lynching . " Congress became " The Liberal Plantation , " where massuhs Ted Kennedy and Joe Biden lash uppity black conservatives . Never mind the energetic whupping the Journal dishes out to black liberals . A variation on this is name-switching . In one of many editorials it rap supporting a school-choice proposal for inner-city Milwaukee children , the page compared the leading voucher opponent , schools superintendent Herbert Grover , to Arkansas segregationist Orval Faubus . <p> To open the Journal 's " Review &; Outlook " page is to enter a looking-glass world where everything is reversed : Clarence Thomas is a nimble jurist and William Brennan a dangerous buffoon ; Edwin Meese is a pillar of integrity and Lawrence Walsh a lowlife sleaze . The page and its outside contributors were stalwart defenders of Robert Bork , Michael Milken , and the whole herd of Iran-contra defendants  --  every eighties villain , in fact , except Jim Wright . <p> History is often rewritten on the editorial page . From the Journal 's unique perspective , the murder of abortion doctor David Gunn by a pro-life fanatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixties . Last March , in an amazing screed headlined " No Guardrails , " deputy editor Dan Henninger blamed the peace and love decade for Gunn 's murder . How ? The sixties destroyed traditional notions of decency and rational discourse and reasonable disagreement , according to Henninger . " We think it is possible to identify the date when the U.S. , or more precisely when many people within it , began to tip off the emotional tracks , " he wrote : August 1968 . The Democratic National Convention that month , and its attendant chaos , inaugurated an era of hotheaded political fanaticism of the sort that led Michael Griffin to shoot Dr. Gunn . No doubt ' 68 was some kind of watershed , but only the Journal could turn that year into a wellspring of 1993 's anti-abortion violence . <p> All of this might be excused as spirited intellectual horseplay , especially by those who hope the page can serve as a tart-tongued voice of opposition to the new administration . On a good day , that 's what it does . But to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obstreperous and into the realm of intellectual dishonesty ; it has all but abandoned any pretense to participating in a rational argument . More and more , the page now traffics in unseemly nastiness backed by flimsy reasoning , the " Who is Vincent Foster ? " series being only the most notorious example . When the ideologues ca n't " find the news , " the ideologues sometimes make it up , ignoring facts whenever convenient and contradicting past pronouncements whenever necessary . <p> Take their views  --  plural  --  on the subject of polygraphs . In the thick of the Clarence Thomas confirmation battle , Anita Hill took and passed a lie detector test . In the next day 's editorial , presciently titled " Credibility Gulch , " the Journal quoted prior statements by Ted Kennedy , Howard Metzenbaum , and Paul Simon doubting the validity of polygraphs . The writer added , " Lie detector tests are so unreliable they are rarely allowed as evidence in court . " <p> Barely eight months later , as Lawrence Walsh prepared to indict former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dart " from the Columbia Journalism Review ) . In attacking the prosecution and calling for a presidential pardon , the page repeated Weinberger 's defense : " If there was a conspiracy , he was n't part of it . " <p> How do we know he was n't part of it ? " Mr. Weinberger has taken and passed a lie detector test on the matter , " the Journal wrote . <p> Almost as astonishing was the Journal 's recent U-turn on the subject of federal funding for the arts . Since the National Endowment for the Arts ( NEA ) controversy erupted , the paper has repeatedly questioned the need for any art subsidies  --  whether the subsidized art is " obscene " or not . " Real Artists Do n't Take Handouts " proclaimed the headline of a piece by Phillip Kauffman , a non-subsidized novelist . In another , Irving Kristol inveighed against the idea that " taxpayers ' money should discover and encourage something called ' creativity ' in the arts . " Kristol added , " Surely this is best left to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's editorialists chimed in on February 26 , 1992 : " Notwithstanding the claque that seems to view endowment funding as a political ' right , ' we think that a government agency that puts its money on the line has the right to make judgments about a work 's value . " <p> Which the NEA did this spring , as it reviewed the grant application of the Hudson Review , a prestigious Manhattan quarterly . When an NEA panel failed to recommend the Review for a grant , the Journal published a scathing op-ed by Roger Kimball , managing editor of The New Criterion and a frequent Journal contributor . " Diversity Quotas at NEA Skewer Magazine , " shrieked the June 24 headline . In a confidential letter that the magazine evidently leaked , the NEA informed the editors that its panel felt " writers of color were significantly under-represented in the Hudson Review . " <p> " We do not have to wait for a new director of the NEA to know what direction support for the arts will take in the Clinton administration , " Kimball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with this particular PC travesty . The offending panel had been selected by Bush appointees . And the " diversity quotas "  --  the NEA 's standard grant guidelines , which encourage " inclusion of women and writers from racially and culturally diverse backgrounds "  --  were written and approved by Bushies , too . <p> The Journal had spent three years condemning the arts-funding-is-a-right " claque , " only to turn around and join it . Perhaps real art journals do need handouts , after all ; indeed , it turns out that the federal arts subsidizers had been doing their best to help the crusty , fussy Hudson Review uphold Western civilization . Since 1977 , its editors have cashed NEA checks totalling $70,437 . Within a week after Kimball 's piece ran , they were on the phone to the NEA , seeking assistance with next year 's grant application . <p> Also rejected in that round of NEA funding were two equally august publications , Paris Review and Antoeus . The problem was not political correctness but lack of funds . One reason why NEA has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the political heat brought to bear by the Journal and its allies . <p> It 's just this sort of thing that 's coming back to haunt Bartley , now that the ' 90s Journal regularly commits the very same sins for which the ' 80s Journal castigated liberals . Violating its own published rules of engagement , it has even developed a taste for borking . Fax Checking <p> No newspaper championed Robert Bork more loudly and more frequently than the Journal . Almost daily , during the fall of 1987 , the paper countered Bork 's often hysterical opposition . So obsessed was it that when the stock market fell 91 points on the October day when Howell Heflin came out against Bork , the Journal 's editorialists saw cause and effect , and dubbed it " The Bork Market . " <p> The best of these pieces were written by then-assistant editor Gordon Crovitz , whose thoughtful exegeses of Bork 's words and deeds , particularly his civil rights record , parried Ted Kennedy 's claim that Bork would " turn back the clock to the days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharpest words for the Bork opponents ' tactics , which it likened to Joe McCarthy 's : their distortions of his record ; " extrapolating " his views ; quoting him out of context ; calling him names . If you 'd read its outraged commentary , you might have thought the Journal would be above such intellectual sleaze . <p> Nonetheless , the borking of Lani Guinier began with an April 30 op-ed by conservative legal activist Clint Bolick , who is practically an adjunct Journal staffer . The page regularly advances his crusades , from the nomination of his close friend Clarence Thomas to pet legal matters , such as the Milwaukee school-voucher case . Although he 's as close as the right-wing gets to a Ralph Nader , Bolick is somehow exempted from the page 's regular denunciation of hyperactive litigators ; editorial writer John Fund is an old friend . <p> " Clinton 's Quota Queens , " which ran the day after Clinton nominated Guinier as assistant attorney general for civil rights , is a masterpiece of borking . In the space of a few hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Guinier 's turgid , lengthy law review articles , adding a few of his own broad-brush characterizations , to portray her as a " Quota Queen . " It was a catchy label , echoing Reagan 's legendary welfare queens , and it stuck . <p> Bolick 's characterization of her writings was about as authentic as Reagan 's yarns  --  or liberals ' selective reading of Bork 's record . Bolick 's snippets from Guinier 's 1989 Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review article make her seem like some sort of Black Panther . But her article mostly dwells upon the shoddy , dishonest enforcement of the Voting Rights Act by the Civil Rights Division under Reagan , where Bolick worked during 1986 and 1987 . Guinier did suggest judicial-appointment quotas  --  specifically , that " the Judiciary committee should begin evaluating federal judicial nominations with reference to specific goals for increasing non-white nominees . " But as for electoral politics , her voting-rights discussion emphasizes the need to avoid " legislative set-asides , color coded ballots , electoral quotas , or ' one black , two votes ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Journal 's errors and clumsy philosophical pirouettes made it a reliable source of unintended comedy this year , until Vincent Foster had to go and ruin it for everybody . What 's odd about June 17 's " Who Is Vincent Foster ? " in light of subsequent events is that it is not particularly vicious or unbridled . It 's a silly display of huffing and puffing , more worthy of a found-onthe-floor college newspaper than a leading national daily . <p> The piece is not even about Foster , but about the Clinton White House 's purported " carelessness about following the law . " What law , you ask ? Why , the Federal Advisory Committee Act ( FACA ) . Not that the Journal had ever gone to bat for FACA in the past ; indeed , the page regularly blasts similar laws as niggling congressional intrusions . Nevertheless , FACA had one thing going for it : A federal judge was threatening to use it to pry open Hillary Clinton 's health-care task force . In high dudgeon , the Journal tsk-tsked the White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its most basic meaning  --  toward legal rulings . " <p> Foster does n't appear until almost halfway through the piece , and only then because the anonymous writer drags him in . " We have a similar problem with Vincent Foster , " he or she wrote . " Having made Webster Hubbell famous , it occured to us that we might have occasion to repeat the favor for other Rose partners , and requested photographs of Mr. Foster and associate White House counsel William Kennedy . " <p> Their " problem " with Foster , in other words , was simply that he would n't cough up a photo for a hatchet job . So the Journal requested Foster 's picture under the Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA )  --  another burdensome bit of congressional activism . " The act requires officials to respond within 10 business days , " the Journal simply noted , but believe it or not , a month later the White House still had n't answered . <p> What were they trying to hide ? And why was Vince Foster debauching those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rode to the rescue . . . by harassing White House staffers about Foster 's picture . The rest of the piece recounted the editorial page 's negotiations with administration officials , unwittingly illustrating its many Reagan-era complaints about harassment of government officials ' by the press . Although the White House ultimately faxed Foster 's photo the night before the editorial was published , the piece was illustrated by a silhouette with a question mark inside . <p> The editors later claimed that they had n't checked the fax machine . <p> Having caught the Clintonites in three minor legal slips , one of which it engineered by filing a ridiculous FOIA request , the Journal apparently felt it had ascended to the moral mountaintop . <p> But the editorial , in historical context , was pure sophism . The Journal spent most of the last decade arguing , much more eloquently , for greater executive privilege  --  and against such laws as FACA and FOIA . Foster was performing the same function for which the Journal lionized Oliver North during the Iran-Contra hearings of 1987 : defending his president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Foster 's suicide was equally hypocritical . It called for an investigation of the death by a special counsel within Justice , a close cousin to the independent counsels it once raged against and abhorred . <p> " Who is Vincent Foster ? " was the culmination of a long string of hit jobs on the Journal 's perceived ideological foes , dating back even before its infamous 1982 attack on Raymond Bonner . As a New York Times reporter , Bonner was led by guerillas to the site of an apparent massacre at El Mozote , El Salvador , that had been committed by U.S.-trained Salvadoran troops . As soon as Bonner 's story appeared , the Journal struck back with a two-column piece , titled " The Media 's War , " that accused Bonner  --  along with nearly every other American foreign correspondent since John Reed  --  of parroting leftist propaganda . It also insinuated that no " massacre " had taken place , and that Bonner had been duped by the Commies . <p> From their Liberty Street cloister , one wonders , how could the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Anyway , they were wrong . This spring , an independent investigation confirmed that the El Mozote massacre had taken place , as Bonner and Alma Guillermoprieto of the Washington Post reported , and as the Journal  --  echoing its Reagan State Department sources  --  had denied . ( Parroting the U.S. Embassy , it must be said , is a much deeper tradition among foreign correspondents than leftist propagandizing is . ) Once again , as in the case of Bill Ellen , one of the nation 's best-selling newspapers  --  1.8 million readers a day  --  had been snookered by a source . <p> The Journal page uses the same facts-bedamned approach when it comes to political scandal . The basic rule of thumb is simple : defend Republicans , attack Democrats . So it leapt to the defense of Alabama Governor Guy Hunt , under investigation in 1991 for a slew of ethical irregularities  --  including his rather colorful practice of flying around the South in a state plane collecting monetary " love offerings " at Primitive Baptist revivals . " To remove a sitting governor because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual values strikes us as absurd , " harrumphed the Journal . Last May , a jury convicted the good guv'nah of the decidedly nonspiritual crime of converting campaign funds to personal use  --  such as buying himself a $4,000 riding mower . He was immediately removed from office . <p> The Journal greeted the news with silence . Meanwhile , it ignored a clear case of prosecutorial overreaching in Alabama : the years-long " investigation " of Birmingham Mayor Richard Arrington , a black Democrat , in which the Republican U.S. Attorney failed to unearth a single indictable deed but managed to set back Birmingham race relations 20 years . Normally vigilant against prosecutorial abuse when the target is a white Republican or business figure , the Journal said nothing . <p> Contrast that silence with the rancor inspired by Democratic Senator Dale Bumpers , who , the Journal charged , was wasting our money : " The U.S. Senate has brazenly voted to have its taxpayer-funded legal counsel represent Sen. Dale Bumpers in a suit to overturn Arkansas ' term limit . " That was n't quite true . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a defendant along with several other Arkansas elected officials . The Senate Counsel merely dispatched a two-page reply to the court stating that Bumpers had no interest in the outcome of the case . Cost to taxpayer : one first-class postage stamp . The writer could have checked out the story with a single phone call . <p> The punchline to all this is found in a November 1992 editorial about the collapse of the October Surprise theory in which the Journal writers piously , and without a hint of irony , warned their colleagues in the press to " be skeptical of convenient partisan accusations . " Paper Cuts <p> The Journalists no doubt have a lot more at stake in all these fights than other newspapers . Having softened the beaches for the supply-side revolution , Bartley and friends now find themselves defending their historical legacy . They staked their own credibility on the success or failure of Reaganism , and , well , the negative evidence is mounting . <p> The logical course , once it became clear that the revolution did n't work , would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After all , Reagan was n't a dictator ; Democrats had controlled the House for four times as long as he occupied the White House . Instead , Bartley and his colleagues undertook to defend the entire mouldering edifice of Reaganism . They continue to insist . for example , that tax cuts do not impair the government 's ability to raise revenue . Damage control seems to be the motive behind Bartley 's latest book , The Seven Fat Years , in which he eloquently insists that things are n't as bad as they seem , and if they are , it 's not Reagan 's fault . <p> The problem is that the Journal and its contributors left themselves no wiggle room for when their political fortunes changed . Their I shrill , sweeping attacks on special prosecutors did not admit the possibility that another administration that might deserve such investigations would ever hold power . Their all-out defense of mediocre nominees left them no credible way to attack someone else 's mediocre nominees . Their rejection of the very idea of " elitist " art subsidies makes them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to special-plead for an elite literary magazine . <p> Many readers , even conservatives , are beginning to think that the Journal 's page is good for entertainment only . Even Jude Wanniski , Bartley 's protege , thinks it 's lost its relevance . " If I read another line-item veto editorial , or another term limits editorial . . . They 've gotten to be hobby horses , and you can fill up space by writing those editorials again and again and again . " <p> Many Journal reporters think of the editorial page as the North Korea of the Dow Jones world : dogmatic , bizarre , and blessedly isolated . But occasionally the relationship between the news and editorial side looks downright combative , particularly when reporters decimate editorial-page heroes . While Bartley 's crew lionized Michael Milken as a financial superhero , for example , front-page editor James B. Stewart was proving beyond a reasonable doubt that Milken was a crook . The Clarence Thomas nomination also occasioned an intra-paper contretemps . In a New Yorker book review this year , Journal reporters Jill Abramson and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's The Real Anita Hill . Brock 's evidence was n't all new . Many of his central assertions  --  that Hill had been harassed by another employer , not Thomas ; that she had been fired by a Washington law firm ; and that her corroborating witnesses were either lying or not telling the whole truth  --  first saw print on the Journal 's editorial page . <p> " Once the sources are evaluated and the contradictory evidence is considered , Brock 's arguments evaporate into an amorphous cloud of ill will , " conclude Abramson and Mayer . Ditto , they might have added . for their own paper 's editorials . <p> Given a choice of whom to trust in these fights , many readers seem to prefer the news side . According to one company source , the page 's readership has declined from more than 60 percent of the paper 's circulation to less than a third . On some level , that 's a shame . For liberals , the Journal page is merely the object of horrified fascination . ( What will those monsters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the world  --  especially the conservative world  --  could use an opposition forum that is both powerful and credible . <p> What we 've got instead is a page that alternates between stupefying , dogmatic pronouncements and borderline paranoia leavened with factual sloppiness . The Journal editorialists would be ignored as a kind of F Troop in the war of ideas if their random , fumbling gun-play wounded less . It 's ironic that the folks who brought us " No Guardrails " lack the basic sense of fairness that is required even of partisan scribes : respect for the truth , a willingness to see that every story has two sides , and the ability to admit that one is , on occasion , dead wrong . <p> ILLUSTRATIONS <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : LANI GUINIER <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : ROBERT BORK <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : RONALD REGAN <p> BY BILL GIFFORD <p> <p> Bill Gifford is an associate editor of Washington City Paper . <p>             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
