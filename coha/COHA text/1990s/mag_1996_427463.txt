When historian Anthony Cohen set out to retrace a route on the Underground Railroad , he recovered a piece of American history <p> Through a dark midnight drizzle , Anthony Cohen is on the run . Like a slave escaped from a plantation in the antebellum South  --  only 150 years later  --  Cohen is testing his fate on the Underground Railroad . He has now spent 700 miles and six weeks engaged in hook-or-crook transport , moving fast and light , retracing a route once used by runaway slaves as they sought refuge in Canada . <p> As it was for his predecessors , Cohen 's trip has been difficult . " I 'll go by foot , boat , train , horse , buggy , any historically accurate way I can hitch a ride , " he 's fond of telling listeners . " I even had myself shipped by train in a tiny box  --  from Philadelphia to New York City . A slave named Henry ( Box ) Brown did that in 1848 . He had himself mailed from Richmond to Philadelphia . Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible . " <p> Right now , though , Cohen is traveling by every escaped slave 's most standard means : his feet . In tonight 's case , he 's hoofing a rainy towpath along the Erie Canal in western New York State . He 's exhausted and behind schedule . He 's a little discouraged , too , though he 's trying not to show it . Earlier tonight , he 'd been buoyed by the prospect of making the nearly 40-mile trip to his next stop by boat , but departure time came and went  --  and he never heard from the captain . <p> So with more than 80 miles still stretching between him and Canada , and only three days to get there , Cohen must rely on himself to make up the difference . " It happens like that sometimes , " he 's saying between runner 's gasps . " Promises get broken . You end up walking all night instead of taking a boat , where you could have rested . Ca n't let it get you down , though . You just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind  --  and you go until you get there . " <p> This particular leg 's duration , he knows , stretches 37 miles . It will keep him at a dogtrot until past sunrise . All night long , the sound of his footfalls will move across fields , swamps and suburban backyards ; often he 'll come close enough to houses to see what 's on TV inside . There are few lights . Fortunately , the towpath is an easily followed conduit to the Niagara River and Canada beyond , just as it was for fugitive slaves . <p> And just as it was for escaped slaves , snarling dogs will chase Cohen . Mosquitoes devil him constantly . Frogs and crickets serenade his toil . At the end of this night , in the sleepy canal town of Middleport , New York , he 's been assured he 'll find a safe house . When he reaches it , the owners will give him food , plus a few blessed hours of sleep in an almost hidden back room . The next day , after an early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the towpath toward Canada . <p> " At times like this , " the 32-year-old historian says between breaths , " I try to think of the escaped slaves coming North . They would n't have quit . They had no choice . Most had never been off the plantation . Everything they knew  --  food , shelter , clothing  --  had always been provided . Then they were on the run : in unknown country , hunted , not knowing who to trust . Their only hope was a promise from the last safe house that a house up the road  --  perhaps a yellow one , with a quilt hanging on the line outside as a signal  --  would take slaves in . They had to avoid the slave-catchers . They were absolutely alone . Nobody would do this if they did n't have to . " <p> Cohen stops to catch his breath . Gravel crunches beneath his feet . A startled heron squawks and takes to the sky , its departure pushing rings across the dark canal 's rain-pocked surface . " You can only understand history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute later , raising his pace once more . " Sometimes , to grasp the deeper whys ' of things , you have to give yourself a new perspective . That 's why I 'm doing this . " <p> To today 's Americans , the Underground Railroad  --  a network of roads , rivers , conveyances and safe houses that guided an estimated 30,000-100,000 escaped slaves toward freedom between the 1830s and the end of the Civil War  --  remains perhaps our least-known roadway . Lacking the Oregon Trail 's aura of pioneer gumption , the tragedy of the Trail of Tears or the eight-cylinder razzle of Route 66 , the Underground Railroad has always been more associated with slaves and abolitionists than with fixed routes or solid locations . <p> Certainly many Americans know of Harriet Tubman , the fugitive slave who became the railroad 's most famous slave transporter ; and Frederick Douglass ( Smithsonian , February 1995 ) , an escaped slave who rose to become an eloquent abolitionist and statesman ; and even the abolitionist minister and editor , Henry Ward Beecher . But beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Underground Railroad means little to most Americans . Those who have studied history may be familiar with the Fugitive Slave Law , passed in 1850 , which made it a federal crime to harbor runaways . The legislation fast became a social and philosophical lightning rod , as it showed the U.S. Government to be a tacit supporter of slavery . But the actual , physical layout of the railroad itself ? To most Americans it 's an amorphous concept , a chunk of history lost . <p> Beginning in the spring of 1996 , however , Anthony Cohen and one of his supporters , the National Parks and Conservation Association ( NPCA ) , a private , nonprofit advocacy group that educates citizens about the national park system , began to change that perception . Just as Lewis and Clark 's explorations are now marked along the Missouri and Columbia rivers , spurring curiosity about their journey , Cohen and others hope that , by the end of the century , routes and stops on the Underground Railroad will bear the same dignified status , perhaps even as a national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the railroad is still around , " says Cohen , strolling the sun-shot canal towpath the day before his 37-mile night . " You only have to look for it . " <p> Seen correctly , Cohen says , the Underground Railroad is as compelling a story as any event in American history . " First , you 've got the human-rights issue of slavery , " he says . " Today its questions are still relevant . Would you risk your well-being to help others , even if you knew jail was the punishment for getting caught ? Would you break the law to do what 's morally right ? Then you 've got the drama of the fugitive slaves . Men , women and children running from a Southern plantation , fugitives in the purest sense . They lived wild in the woods . They stole hogs to eat . They risked their lives on this journey , and for one thing  --  freedom . They chanced everything to gain something we take for granted : equality as a human being . " <p> To prepare , Cohen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had such a luxury . Instead , he spent hundreds of hours in the Library of Congress and other archives , where he pored over documents and slave accounts to nail down routes and transport modes . Then , in Sandy Spring , Maryland , on May 4 , 1996 , after filling a backpack with a change of clothes , he hit the road like a fugitive slave : moving on foot , occasionally traveling on trains , hitching rides on canal boats . Unlike the slaves , he travels mostly by daylight , though travel in darkness is sometimes necessary . By the time he beds down at night  --  ideally in a barn or secret room said to have been an underground stop  --  he 's traveled 10-25 miles , addressed school groups or village historic societies , and spent the rest of the day assessing purported underground-railroad rooms or anecdotes . <p> He has no assistant , no support staff . " It 's all me , " he says . " I 've got a cellular phone , an 800 number with voice mail , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People contact me . They say : Tony , stay overnight in my barn , talk to my school . ' And I try to set it up . I have to keep things pretty loose though , since I 'm on a few missions at once : walk , speak , research . Keeping my schedule flexible is the only way I can do all three things and not go crazy . " <p> His walk has also caught the media 's notice , a circumstance that inspires increased hoopla with each successive stop . In fact , a few days from now , when he arrives in Buffalo , New York , for a Juneteenth Festival ( an annual holiday celebrating the emancipation of slaves , usually observed on a weekend in the " teens " of June ) , he 'll be greeted by 60,000 festival goers , three newspapers and a camera crew from the local ABC affiliate . All of this interest , Cohen says , stems from the fact that few Americans of any race know much about the Underground Railroad and how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or free Northern blacks , the railroad spirited fugitive slaves to safety ; but it also served as saboteur in an era when America 's industrial North and agrarian South were increasingly at odds . <p> " Remember that the South was an agricultural economy , primarily cotton , " Cohen says . " Those crops were tended by unpaid slaves , who often made plantation owners incredibly wealthy . So the Underground Railroad was n't only a high moral cause ; it helped wound the Southern economy . Religious and political commitment to the Underground Railroad was one reason for its success ; there were less noble pressures as well . " <p> Cohen 's immediate goal is to " heighten awareness " that , from the 1830s through the Civil War , a complex network of Underground Railroad routes existed . The one he is retracing worked up through Maryland and Pennsylvania , then swung west across New York State and into Canada via boats on Lake Ontario and the Niagara River . Other routes worked farther west , through Kentucky and Missouri , up into Ohio , Indiana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wisconsin , and by boat on Lake Erie . Still others went south to Mexico or Cuba . <p> Cohen also wants to reinforce for people that , whatever transport was used  --  " And most everything was , " he says  --  the railroad was n't a locomotives-and-steel subway , a misconception that helped inspire the project . As the son of a retired Department of Agriculture entomologist father and a schoolteacher mother , Cohen was raised in the Washington , D.C. suburb of Silver Spring , Maryland . ( Cohen 's family name , it appears , does not come out of slavery . His great-grandfather was adopted by a Jewish family . ) <p> After graduating from American University in 1994 , Cohen went to work as a freelance historian for Montgomery County , Maryland . The county historical society had published his senior thesis , The Underground Railroad in Montgomery County , Maryland , as a book . One day in the spring of 1995 , while Cohen was addressing a local school , a fourth-grader asked about the Underground Railroad 's trains . " The other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cohen says . " I mean , it was n't a stupid question . The kid just did n't know . " <p> Before long , Cohen began publicizing his idea for retracing the railroad and soliciting sponsors  --  out of which emerged his affiliation with the National Parks and Conservation Association . " Vincent de Forest , a mover and shaker in trying to get the Underground Railroad accepted as a unit of the National Park Service , pointed Tony our way , " says Jill McKay , on-line services coordinator at the NPCA . " In March of 1996 , as Tony was preparing for his walk , he began working with us as an intern , compiling our Underground Railroad database . Then someone thought to put his information on the World Wide Web , and we thought maybe he 'll get one message a week : the Website gets several hundred visitors a day . At least ten of these people post messages for Tony every day . People have really hooked up to Tony 's walk and , using our Website , they are inspired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his journey , Cohen was lent a cellular telephone and given an 800 number at NPCA . But he still had to go out and walk , researching as he went . A documentary film of the project is in the works  --  with equipment donated by the American Folklife Center of the Library of Congress  --  as is a book to be written by Cohen , which will filigree events of his trip with historic anecdotes about the railroad . <p> " I began finding stories almost immediately , " he says . " I was directed to a black minister in the town of Waterloo , Maryland . His name was Reverend Howard , and he took me to a stream called Deep Run that had a series of caves along its banks . It was where Harriet Tubman used to hide fugitive slaves . After they 'd had a chance to rest there , she 'd lead them downstream to the Patapsco River , where a railroad line went . When a train passed , the slaves could catch it to Baltimore . " <p> Cohen , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't always mean it 's true . Because of this , he 's constantly double-checking background data with libraries and historic societies along the way . " My favorite false legend so far , " he says , " happened in Poughkeepsie , New York . I was passing through and this man said : The Underground Railroad ended right here , in this town . ' Well , because I check this stuff out , I said : OK , where did it end ? ' He pointed up the road to this sort of modern-looking apartment complex . He said : It ended at the Harriet Tubman Apartments . ' " <p> Cohen laughs . " I marked it down in my notes , " he says . " But I did n't check it out . " He shakes his head . " That guy pretty much summed up what Americans know of the Underground Railroad . They do n't know dates or routes . They know Harriet Tubman 's name . " <p> Another day finds Cohen not on the road but in the attic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pittsford , New York . Pittsford , seven miles southeast of Rochester , was established in 1789 . A prosperous town during the boom years of the Erie Canal , the 1820s and ' 30s , it is said to have been a major stop on the Underground Railroad . <p> The mansion is a hulking , Federal-style monster that 's now part of the St. Louis Church and School . It also has all the earmarks of a onetime slave harbor . The street level is a quadrant of four square parlor rooms . The parlors to the house 's south side , however , are a little less deep than those on the north . And while those south-side rooms appear to share a common wall and a heavy swinging door , they do n't . In between them , a secret passage of narrow stairs leads from the house 's basement to its third-floor attic . In the cellar , an opening , now bricked over , faces the canal a short distance away . In the dark and stuffy attic , where Cohen now stands talking with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large wooden cage rests beneath the eaves . Cohen , who has opened the cage door and is now standing inside its 8-by-10-foot space , makes fast work of assessing its age . " How old did you say the house is ? " he asks Schrecker . " Begun in 1812 ; finished in 1815 . One of the owners was a judge . " <p> " Hmmm , " Cohen says . " That 's certainly promising . Judges in fact were sometimes part of the Underground Railroad , since they socialized with the local ministers and educated people , who were usually among the railroad 's supporters . Having a judge on the abolitionist side had big benefits . When someone would get arrested for harboring slaves , a sympathetic judge could dismiss the case on technicalities , or his office could lose the paperwork  --  thereby throwing the whole thing out . " <p> Cohen runs his hand across the hinges . " This ironwork is hand-forged , " he says . " So it 's possible it was here during the period of the railroad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , set back from a narrow window . " Look , " he says . " This cage is 18 inches from the window and the wall . Why ? It 's so people on the street could n't see what was inside . " Inside the cage , he sees a length of forged chain attached to a fitting pounded deep into another roof beam . He says this arrangement looks like a standard shackle from the time of the Underground Railroad . " This room 's a mystery , " he says . <p> But he knows of other locations with parallels to this room . Occasionally , when someone hiding slaves feared local law officers were becoming curious , the harborer would bind and shackle the slaves and lock them up . That way , if the fugitives were discovered and accusations started flying , he 'd say the slaves had recently been captured and were awaiting transport back South . <p> Cohen steps out of the cage , latching the door behind him . As he heads for the secret stairway , picking his way across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Is this a bona fide site ? " he asks . " Perhaps . This stairway seems legitimate ; the house certainly has the right lineage . But only documentation will authenticate the site . During the time of the Underground Railroad , few people kept documentation ; they did n't want to get caught with incriminating papers . Unfortunately , that absence of records means that we are often left with little hard evidence . " <p> On another afternoon , in the canal town of Spencerport , New York , perhaps 20 miles west of Pittsford , the cafeteria at Bernabi Elementary School is packed with kids . The room is sweltering : some 300 of Bernabi 's third- and fourth-grade students are in attendance , rapt . Cohen is onstage at the room 's far end . He has just started telling the story of Henry ( Box ) Brown . " He was a slave in Richmond , Virginia , and sometime in 1848 he had himself shipped to freedom in Philadelphia , " Cohen is saying . " He did it in a wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was in there for 26 hours ! " The students gasp . " So when I was in Philadelphia , " Cohen goes on , " I decided to try the same thing , only I 'd ship myself from Philly to New York City . " <p> He sits on the floor , curled tight , knees at his chest . " With the help of a few friends , " Cohen says , " we measured around me . My box 's dimensions were 24 inches by 28 by 30 . We built a trapdoor into one side , so the only person able to open it was me . We drilled one-inch air holes in the box , so I could breathe . Then we figured out that people would be able to see me , so we covered most of the holes over with stickers . " <p> Cohen stands back up , pacing the stage again . " All I had in the box with me was my telephone , a bottle of water , a small quilt , a pillow and a pocketknife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take two hours , but the train was late . It took more than five hours . Inside the box , the temperature rose to more than 100 degrees . My glasses fogged over . I could see sweat forming on the box 's hinges ; they were dripping . It was so hot I had to shift around and pull out my pocketknife . I cut the legs off my pants . " <p> Then , as the train pulled out of the station , Cohen ( who was traveling unbeknownst to railroad authorities ) saw the door of the freight car slide open next to him : " It had n't been locked ! " The kids gasp again . " It was terrifying ! " Cohen says . " I thought I was going to fall out ! I could see through a little hole only partially covered by a sticker . I saw trees , cows , farms : New Jersey ! It was all flashing past . And I kept thinking : If I get jiggled out , I 'll die . I 'll get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer , I 'm going to die from the heat . ' The pain was terrible  --  I was all scrunched up . And I kept thinking : Come on , Tony , you can do this ; Box Brown did it for 26 hours . ' Then , when I got to New York , they almost did n't take me off the train . My box had been marked to go farther on , to Long Island , but some friends found me and pulled me off . When I got out , I drank water nonstop for hours . I 'd sweat so much , though , that I did n't have to go to the bathroom for almost three days . " <p> The children are amazed . The room  --  its 300 little faces fixed on the stage  --  remains silent throughout Cohen 's monologue . When his talk ends , kids keep him trapped for another hour , asking questions about slavery , about his journey , about race issues and American history and whether he ever feels like quitting . <p> Later that evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cohen to Bernabi , how the assembly played . Walking alongside Cohen for a few miles as he continues up the towpath , she smiles . " Someone saw his Web page , " she recalls , " so we e-mailed him , asking if he 'd stop by . You would n't believe the difference this kind of presentation makes . Children learn that history happened in their town . That kind of realization opens a whole world to them . " <p> Two relentless days of walking pass . Sixteen or 20 hours each . At 10 p.m. on Thursday night , in the canal town of Gasport , New York , he 's still about ten miles from his destination  --  without enough time to walk the rest of the way . His hostess for the evening , Carol Murphy of Murphy Orchards in the town of Burt , New York , is waiting up for him . Cohen 's especially interested in Murphy 's e-mail message : beneath a trapdoor in her barn lies an underground chamber . It 's a room said to have once housed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murphy farm  --  perhaps two miles from the shore of Lake Ontario and near the mouth of Eighteen Mile Creek  --  shows every indication of being the real thing . So at Gasport 's steel deck bridge , which spans the canal , Cohen hops into a van and , in a few Detroit-made minutes , crosses a stretch of western New York that would have required hours on foot . <p> Immediately after meeting Murphy and her daughter , Xandy , Cohen is shown to the barn , where Carol opens a dusty , out-of-the-way trapdoor set into the floor . Xandy plugs in an orange extension cord that drops through the hole in the floor , and through a narrow , angled passage a light flicks on . " That 's it , " Carol Murphy says . " Would you like to go down and explore ? " <p> A rickety wooden ladder descends through the tiny entrance and into a secret room . The air smells musty and carries an underground chill . The 12-by-15-foot room is covered in crumbling white plaster . The floor is coated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all corners . Even after 150 years , the scent of desperation or fear is easy to smell . You can feel it . <p> Cohen walks around the room . He posits that , given the narrowness of the entrance , this was not a root cellar or a fireproof storage area . The smallness of the passageway would n't allow for anything larger than human beings to slip through . Seeing soot on one wall and a hole in the arched ceiling , Cohen surmises that a fireplace may have stood there , its chimney pipe passing through the hole . The floor is among the most amazing finds of his trip . <p> Layered with six inches of smashed crockery , fragments of shoes , rusted eating utensils , pieces of leather gloves , tar paper shreds and unidentifiable moldering black bits , it is a cultural archaeologist 's mother lode . Cohen hopes that archaeologists will someday visit here to carefully sift the floor 's pile . <p> " Look at the way the room 's shaped , " Carol Murphy shouts down through the entrance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rugged L , with the largest portion invisible to anyone poking his head down through the entrance . " I think there used to be a board barricade down there , " she says . " We think it was there so if slave-catchers showed up , it could be fitted into place like a fake wall , so the room would look like a small cellar . " <p> Cohen spends a few more minutes in the chamber . He lifts objects off the floor and examines them , then places them back precisely where he found them . Coming up the ladder , Cohen is ecstatic . Carol Murphy is waiting near the barn 's sliding door . " What 's down there , " Cohen says , " is history . Beautiful , amazing , untouched history . " He points down the ladder 's rungs and back into the hole . " The Underground Railroad , " he says , smiling . " It might very well be right down there . " <p> The next evening , after a long day of walking , Cohen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he strolls through the tended grass of Niagara Reservation State Park , he 's bubbling over . After days of " film at eleven " TV-news interviews , he 's dodged the media tonight . By his own choice , nobody will be there to ask how he 's doing when he finally lays eyes upon what every fugitive slave once hoped to see . <p> As Cohen approaches Niagara Falls and the yawning chasm between the American and Canadian shores , sunlit mist from the falls throws a sentimental , pinkish glow on the scene . At first , Cohen ca n't believe he 's arrived ; he 's hopping with excitement , almost leaping into the air with each step . <p> Then , as he nears the falls ' edge , he becomes more introspective . For a long minute he stares at the palisades on the far shore : Canada . For another long time he looks at the falls , the tumbling water hypnotic and full of shifting color in the sunset . His dark eyes are blank , almost glazed . For a man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressions on reserve , Cohen 's features have gone slack . " After six weeks of walking ; after all these miles , " he says , " It 's almost too much to take in . Huh . There it is . " <p> Then after a stop in Buffalo , where he marches as a guest of honor in the Juneteenth Festival parade and films an interview for local television , there is only one thing left to do . On Sunday , June 16 , at a little after 5 in the afternoon , Cohen boards a small fishing boat at the Harbour Place marina in Buffalo , and sets out for Canada . His pilot is Kevin Cottrell , a local historian and black-history tour operator . Cottrell , who has guided groups on legs of the Underground Railroad since 1993 , is giving Cohen a wide berth as they board the small , red aluminum boat for the mile-long run across the river . <p> " I know what he 's feeling right now , " Cottrell says . " And it 's powerful stuff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sacrifices of those who came before us , that 's our heritage . When you get to this river , and you get your first taste of what it must have been like to reach out and touch that sense of freedom . . . Well , it knocks you back . " <p> Cohen , for his part , is pacing the marina 's dock , hugging most of the dozen people who 've arrived to see him off . Tears often well in his eyes . " It sounds corny , I know , " he says , shaking off a weepy bout , " but after walking all that way , I thought this would be the happiest moment of the whole trip . Instead , I feel incredibly sad . More than any other time in the past six weeks , I 'm suddenly understanding how difficult this trip must have been . The fugitive slaves had families they 'd never see again . They were leaving the only life they 'd ever known . They were leaving it all behind , right here . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ten minutes later , Cottrell 's skiff noses against the Canadian shore at Fort Erie , Ontario , at a known landing for runaway slaves . As Anthony Cohen steps from the boat onto land , conflicting emotions seem to cross his face like a lightning storm . From all around , members of the Niagara Black History Association approach and welcome him to Canada . He climbs the bank before turning to glance back across the river . He drops to his knees . Tears come into his eyes . " Without this shore , " he finally says , " the fugitive slaves would have had no refuge . " He pats the grassy soil , then breaks into a bittersweet smile . " It looks so simple , " he says , plucking up a few strands of grass as he emits a tiny , relieved laugh , " but this is freedom .
