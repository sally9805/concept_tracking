Just beyond the gaze of the golden Buddha in the Eindawya pagoda in Mandalay , the spiritual heart of Burma , dozens of soldiers slouched around the courtyard , propping their rifles against the stone balustrades . Outside the temple gates , more troops manned barbed-wire barricades . " Please leave , " an army captain shouted last week to a group of tourists trying to photograph the Buddha . " You may come back when our security situation is right . " <P> Burma 's brief experiment with multiparty politics is over , and the country is reverting to the xenophobia and isolation of its past . In a nationwide crackdown on its opposition , the military junta led by Senior General Saw Maung has arrested at least 40 officials of the National League for Democracy , including 16 members of parliament , and some 200 rebel monks , many of them activists of the Young Monks Association . Hundreds more monks have slipped out of their monasteries and returned to their homes in the countryside . Six months after the League won a surprise electoral victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> As the glimmer of democracy is snuffed out , tentative moves toward a more open economy that Burma began in 1989 are likely to go with it . Sometimes called the world 's richest basket case because of its wealth of such natural resources as teak and minerals , Burma needs foreign aid and investment to modernize . In the wake of the elections last May , international lending agencies were lining up to welcome Burma , and foreign businessmen were studying the country 's new , liberal economic policies , but many investors are pulling back . " No one will lend money to Burma until it sorts out its political situation , " says a visiting World Bank official . <P> Just as the crackdown was reaching its peak last week , Amnesty International made public another indictment of the army 's brutal rule . In a 72-page special report , the London-based human-rights organization accused Burma 's junta of " silencing the democratic movement " with systematic terror and torture . <P> To dramatize their plight , four Burmese hijacked a Thai Airways jetliner on Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bangkok-to-Rangoon flight to Calcutta , the hijackers said they wanted to make the world " hear our pleas for justice and human rights . " They surrendered peaceably to Indian authorities . <P> Silencing democracy describes Burma 's standard operating procedure since 1962 , when General Ne Win seized power from an ineffectual civilian government . His iron hand at home and suspicion of foreigners turned Burma into a hermit state . At the same time , his bizarre form of socialism reduced the once prosperous former British colony to penury while more backward neighbors were performing miracles of economic growth . <P> After 26 years of decline , pressures for change finally pushed Ne Win into retirement in July 1988 . Decades of anger erupted in bloody riots in the streets of Rangoon a month later and continued on and off for six weeks , leaving more than 3,000 dead . General Saw Maung , the armed forces chief of staff , seized power as chairman of the authoritarian State Law and Order Restoration Council , which was to govern until elections .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
