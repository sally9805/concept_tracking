ONE HUNDRED MILES SOUTHWEST OF MY TOWN A ridge juts out of the mountains onto the floor of a great valley . To the men who take their grain from the valley and their protein off the hills this ridge is known simply as the " hogback . " Every winter , several hundred elk funnel out of the alpine cirques in the high country to feed on the windblown flanks of the ridge , and every weekend in January several dozen hunters who have drawn cow permits set their alarms for the small hours in order to meet them there . The hunt is by no means a certain success , for nowhere do the ranch roads approach closer than a couple of miles , and the elk , having watched the procession of headlights with no idle curiosity , are on the move before the hunters have climbed out of their cabs . But if there is enough snow falling to obscure the stalk , or enough already on the ground that the animals have few avenues of retreat , then a number of the herd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow will streak the face of the hogback , and when the horses have done their part , red-faced men will grunt and strain to drag the carcasses onto the truck beds . In a dry winter , like the one that has passed , the story is different . By January the elk are there , but every Friday morning thereafter , just as each of the four four-day hunts begins , they file up into the widow 's peak of forest on the ridgetop and disappear . A half hour or so later the hunter with the darkest circles under his eyes reaches the crest of the hogback where he stands , blowing his breath out into chill air that , if the wind is quiet , carries the dank odor of the animals ' retreat . It is then that most men decide splitting a side of beef with their neighbor was not such a bad idea , after all . Stephanie Matock-Cooley , the young wildlife biologist who works the game check trailer in the valley , will have a cup of coffee and a smile for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chunk of smoked salmon in the refrigerator , and she saves her salmon  --  and her respect  --  for those hunters who , having reached this turning point , press upward in the wake of the scent . Several weeks ago I sat on one of the chairs in the trailer after a particularly cold day in the mountains , having earned a bite of Stephanie 's salmon for the third day in a row , but with as yet no elk for my freezer . " I 'm just going to leave this trailer unlocked and you can hang your wet socks and things over by that heater , " Stephanie said . " If it gets too cold sleeping in your car , you can come in and warm up . I should have thought of that when your brother was here . The way you two hunt , it 's the least I can do . " My brother Kevin had tasted Stephanie 's salmon the weekend before . But during the four days of his permit , all he had accomplished was to set the precedent I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier and stayed later , each evening we slumped down a little farther into the chair , became glassy-eyed faster , and made conversation more slowly , until whatever initial respect Stephanie professed for our efforts had subsided into a form of matronly pity . Bracing myself for the 80-degree temperature drop that awaited my first step outside the door , I pulled my hat on my head and managed a wan smile . I said , " Stephanie , I 'll tell you what . Save me that last chunk of salmon and by God I 'll get one tomorrow and save the family honor . " She looked officiously at the blackboard over my head . " Shooting light starts at 7:28 , " she said . AT A FEW MINUTES BEFORE THE LEGAL HOUR I STOOD ON top of the hogback , looking through my binoculars at the first elk I had seen since my hunt started . Below me , down the backslope of the hogback , was a deep gulch blackened by a thick growth of pine . On the far side of it rose a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower slopes , becoming tree-clad toward the top . The elk were in one of the bluish-white openings that puzzled the high timber , on the shoulder of a ravine that zigged its way down the ridge to the gulch . They were at such high elevation that scallops of snow swallowed their legs , and were so far away that I could distinguish the bulls from the cows only by posture . Knowing that my descent down the far side of the hogback might find me on my backside as often as on my feet , I slipped the cartridges out of the breech of my Wilkes double rifle and left all common sense on the hogback . The temperature was 10 below zero . I had the zipper of my coat down in 5 minutes , and once I had crossed the gulch and started climbing up the ravine toward the herd , I took the coat off . Even then I had to stop every 10 minutes and open the buttons on my shirt to keep from overheating . The snow in the bottom of the ravine came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much snow would have driven the elk out onto the hogback , but this snow was powder to the bottom and feathered up into the breeze with every step . It could brush the chocolate hair on an elk 's belly and pose no obstacle to its progress , but it was a nightmare to mine . It was as treacherous as wading up a river on a night without stars . Every 20 or 30 yards my boot would find a peeled log that was as slick as a stone worn smooth under water , and when I was n't falling from the footing , I was stepping into pockets in the snow drifts that buried me to my waist . This would not have been so bad if I could have taken my time . But already the sun had begun to find seams in the cloud cover . Before long the day would have warmed enough to halt the cold flow of air that was sinking down the ravine , and I would be faced with the hopeless task of working uphill into a herd of elk with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position of the elk by a stand of aspens that grew on the right side of the ravine . The opening they were feeding in had been a little farther up the ridge , and when I reached the first of these gnarled old trees , I foolishly concluded that I was still some distance from the herd . The aspens , which covered several acres of undulating hillside and which were bitten gray to a great height by the elk , were studded here and there with enormous fir trees . I had no more than taken a step into the stand when I caught the eye of an elk that was bedded in the basin of one of the firs . It was a bull . His head was in profile and he was looking at me out of his right eye . For several minutes he looked at me , or perhaps it is more accurate to say toward me . Then slowly he twisted his muzzle around , and as soon as the back of his head came into view I sank down into the snow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some reason it had not , and now that the bull had granted me a reprieve , I was determined not to lose my chance . Getting onto all fours and slinging the rifle over my back , I began to crawl up the hillside , digging my way forward with my hands . I could smell elk , but when I cautiously raised my head after a few minutes I could not see any . My eyes drifted to the solitary firs . There was an elk 's head , chiseled against the dark bark . Another bull . Where were the cows ? Were there any cows ? I was reluctant to proceed much farther . If I did , I would soon have the wind trailing back toward elk I had already passed . I crawled another few yards and rose to my knees . There was an elk . It was bedded among the aspens about 40 yards away , just over the crest of a small rise . I put my binoculars on its ears . I could n't see any antlers , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finally it did , and despite the wandering focus of the binoculars  --  I was shaking as much from fatigue as from excitement  --  I was certain it was a cow . I 'd have to stand to see enough of its body for a shot . Boom ! As the muzzles of the rifle rose in recoil , a dozen elk jumped to their feet and crashed up the hillside . The cow was with them . She looked unhurt , but before I could bring the sights to bear she whipped round and , stalking stiff-leggedly , trotted back down behind the aspens where she had bedded . I swung the double in front of her . This time when the barrels rose , twigs snapped into the air and the cow dropped out of sight . I was standing over her a few moments later . The air was heavy with her pungent , sweetish scent , and the aspens were boldly etched against the deep snow . The country looked new to me , as it always does after the shots have faded away . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my feet , and the smoke still curling from the barrels of my rifle , it was as if the past 2 hours had never happened . I could not remember pulling the triggers . I could recall fighting through the snow in the ravine , but that seemed to have occurred many months ago . It was as though I had been mysteriously transported to this high place . It was as if I had been pulled into the current of a great river from the moment I saw elk , and had been swept along by that current , and now that the river had spread and calmed , I stood on the bank with no memory of the feel of the water . Later that evening I sank back into a chair in the game check trailer and tried to convey these thoughts to Stephanie , who does not hunt . I told her that while I could recall the details of the stalk , I could not remember what it was like to be there , to be swept up in the current . I may even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was life itself , but life compressed into a brilliance that so transcended the ordinary pace of existence that my mind could not recapture the experience . And that whatever respect she awarded my efforts was unwarranted , for I could no more have turned my back on the hunt once I had seen elk than I could swim upriver . I am certain I failed at this , just as I am failing here , with pretentious sincerity , to describe that which is visceral , simple , and instinctual . I would have been better off just eating the salmon . The author , a Montanan , is a frequent contributor to this magazine . <p>
