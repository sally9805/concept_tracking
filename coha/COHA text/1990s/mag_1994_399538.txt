In this volatile stock market , small investors may be tempted to buy only the shares of giant companies . But sometimes firms with the steadiest profit gains are smaller corporations that dominate lucrative business niches . Here are two such companies that currently get high marks from analysts : Forschner Group ( symbol : FSNR ; OTC , $12.50 ; no yield ) . The exclusive marketer of Original Swiss Army knives in North America , Forschner 's multiblade pocketknives range in price from $9 to $140 for a model that includes a fish scaler . " The knife business is growing close to 10% a year , " says analyst James P. Hammel at Advest in Hartford . One reason : the Shelton , Conn. firm is steadily broadening the market for its pocketknives , which account for half its estimated 1994 sales of $125 million . For example , Forschner 's Signature series consists of pocketknives designed specifically to appeal to women . " They come in a full range of hot colors and include a ball-point pen rather than a toothpick , " explains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even greater earnings growth has come from the company 's efforts to extend the high-quality image of its Swiss Army brand to other products . For example , Forschner hit it big with its Swiss Army watches , introduced in 1992 and currently priced from $75 to $500 . " In the beginning , they did n't expect to sell more than $10 million a year , but the watches will bring in $30 million in ' 94 , " says analyst Dennis Moran at A.G. Edwards in St. Louis . Overall , the analysts expect Forschner 's earnings to grow 15% to 20% annually over the next three years and think the stock could rise 44% to top $18 within the next 18 months . Juno Lighting ( JUNO ; OTC , $19.50 ; 1.5% ) . One of the top three U.S. makers of track and recessed lighting , Juno is projected to have sales of $125 million this year . " The company has about 20% of a $600 million market , " says analyst Elliott Schlang at Kidder Peabody in Cleveland . Juno provides lighting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Commercial clients include such firms as Disney , Florsheim and The Gap , " says analyst Kevin E. Silverman at Kemper Securities in Chicago . Juno 's growth will come chiefly from its existing business . " The company produces unique , innovative products such as recessed lights for sloping ceilings , " says analyst David Jarrett at Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York City . " Juno also makes 100% of its products in the U.S. , so it can ship them within 48 hours , " he adds . With an ongoing economic recovery boosting remodeling and new-home sales , the analysts project that Juno 's earnings can increase 14% to 15% a year . They add that the stock could gain 28% to $25 within 18 months . <p>
