<p> Scant teachers ' benefits <p> R. Bhargava ( Viewpoints , Aug. 14 , " Teachers ' benefits many " ) obviously took little time to check his perception of the benefits package offered to teachers in Texas against real facts . Had he taken the time to either talk to a teacher or request information from any of the Texas school districts , he would have found very different information . <p> I am not sure how he defines vacation , but most employers define it as a paid day when an employee does not have to report to work , and Texas teachers do not receive a single paid day of vacation . They are paid on a daily rate - not on an annual salary . <p> Those who are able to secure summer employment with their school districts either writing curriculum or teaching summer school do so at an hourly rate that is well below their regular rate . Consequently , the adjusted annual income Bhargava projected was far from correct . <p> Further , a real vacation is a time period in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have on-going professional development needs , many of which are required by their school districts . These are accomplished over the summer and the costs are not reimbursed by the local school districts . <p> Teachers do have health insurance . While most professionals have their insurance paid fully by their employer and often that of their dependents , teachers generally are forced into low-quality health-maintenance organizations by school districts that pay partial , employee-only coverage . <p> Teachers are covered by a state retirement plan , but they pay more than half of the cost of this plan and Texas is one of 11 states that does not provide Social Security for its teachers . <p> The only " benefit " Bhargava correctly identified was the " opportunity to interact with the future of our nation . " And that is the only reason most teachers are in the classroom . <p> Unfortunately , it is not enough to attract sufficient relacements for an aging teaching force . Houston Independent School District is starting school with well over 400 vacancies and has been forced to fill hundreds of other teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Houston Federation of Teachers <p> ' Cruel and unusual ' punishment <p> The two Viewpoints letters in a row from people who " do n't give a damn " about the ones incarcerated ( Aug. 11 , " Fix overheated prisons last , " from Walter Armatys and Aug. 12 , " Prisoners ' comfort is last , " from Marc Gray ) were hard to read . <p> Heat is an element that is hard on the human body . It can even kill , as we have seen in this latest heat wave . <p> Armatys feels that those incarcerated should be the last on the list for heat relief . And Gray thinks the heat is just another good tool in law enforcement . <p> Gray stated that at some stage in their lives , these prisoners made a decision and now do n't have the ability to " play well with others . " <p> These prisoners are human beings and do not deserve to be punished to the point of heat exhaustion . <p> At least citizens on the outside have family , friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are locked up in cages are at the mercy of the prison system - no one on the outside can bring them any relief . <p> Our Texas prisons are full of people incarcerated for nonviolent , first-time drug offenses . Punishment never has worked and never will work as a deterrent for crime or in learning to " play well with others . " <p> Jimmy Green , Houston <p> In response to Marc Gray 's Aug. 12 Viewpoints letter " Prisoners ' comfort last " : I wonder does Gray know there are thousands of men and women in Texas prisons who are completely innocent ? What about them ? What about the Constitution , which says " no cruel and unusual punishment " ? There are also people in our prisons who were incarcerated because they could n't afford an attorney who would honestly fight for them . You , sir , are being cold-hearted . <p> Winnie Moore , Houston <p> Abortion horrific choice <p> Emily Kopp ( Outlook , Aug. 10 , " Anti-abortion legislation could cost women dearly " ) should step back and rethink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to " avoid childbirth " completely downgrades what is a horrific practice . An abortion is not an " avoidance , " it is a " termination " of a life . <p> To claim that anti-abortion legislation will muffle the voices of those who urge family planning is totally misleading . Most of the advocates of family planning are pro-life people who plead for alternative methods for a horrible crime . <p> Edward J. Sanchez Jr. , Houston <p> Bicyclist shares roadways <p> James Bell 's ( Viewpoints , Aug. 12 , " Road privilege not a right " ) assertion that Texas should somehow ban bicycles from our roadways , is just another example of the road-hog mentality of many of our area motorists . <p> While he maintains that the state only grants the use of the roadway to people and vehicles that meet certain requirements , such as a license , inspections , insurance , etc. , he fails to recognize that state law considers a bicycle to be a vehicle and , as such , is just as entitled to use our roadways as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use my bicycle to commute to work , mostly for the exercise , but also to do my part in a small way to save gas and cut down on pollution . <p> When doing so , I do have a license , I am insured and I do have ownership papers . If the authorities feel that getting an annual inspection for my bike would somehow make our roadways safer , I would be glad to do so ( I hope they do n't insist I get it tested for emissions ) . <p> The bottom line is , I share the roadway with automobiles , not because I want to ride in traffic , but because there is no other place to ride . <p> If legislative action is needed , it should be to mandate that any future road projects provide bike lanes or separate bike paths . <p> That would help keep those of us trying to do our part for the environment out of the way of smoke-spewing pedal-to-the-metal motorists such as Bell . <p> Larry Houston , Baytown <p> Switched babies are loved <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at birth seem to be some of the finest people anyone could ever wish to know ( " Family OKs blood test in baby-switching case , " Chronicle , Aug. 6 ) . The two families seem to be wholeheartedly doing what is in the best interest of and demonstrating the purest of love for both of these girls . How tragic it would be if they uprooted these innocent babies from the only parents , homes and lives they have ever known and sent them to strangers . <p> May both families be blessed with all good things as they work together to merge their families for the sake of those little girls . <p> Karen Sager Torres , Houston <p> People are not for hitting <p> Elbert R. Ogilvie 's " Paddle 's thwack the answer to school troubles " ( Aug. 16 , Outlook ) is so wrong it is frightening . <p> My research has shown that corporal punishment is a problem , not a solution . <p> The students who are subjected to corporal punishment lack self-discipline and the intrinsic motivation needed to work and learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of spanking parents use to control their children . <p> Those making A 's ca n't remember being spanked , while the lowest grades were earned by students whose parents still were spanking them in high school . <p> Fear works for young children . Perhaps if parents would take the time to use positive discipline methods instead of external control methods , their children just might do better in the long run . <p> People are not for hitting . <p> Karen North , Houston
