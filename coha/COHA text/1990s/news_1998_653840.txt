<p> A 19-YEAR-OLD college student sat alone with a computer as a commanding voice echoed through the windowless room . <p> " Now go to No. 5 , " the voice said . " Find out what the weather is like in San Jose . " <p> The student was taking part in a test of the Go Network , the Walt Disney Company 's answer to Yahoo , America Online and all the other " portals " to the Internet  --  entry points to a world of information , entertainment and commerce . <p> Go was n't going so well , however , at this late October test in Sunnyvale , Calif . As the student scowled , three young women behind a one-way mirror monitored each of her hesitant clicks of the mouse . It took her a long time to find the weather section on Go 's crowded front page ; then she was stumped , because she thought she needed to know San Jose 's ZIP code . She could have determined the weather in Silicon Valley a lot more quickly by stepping outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of Go by now , especially since it is offering a preview of the site ( go.com ) to the public starting tomorrow . While the company is already a major presence on the Internet  --  with popular sites for sports fanatics ( espn.com ) , news hounds ( abcnews.com ) and soap opera viewers ( abc.com ) , among hundreds of others  --  it is now making a bigger bet on cyberspace than any other media concern in the world . <p> In a complex deal in June , Disney traded some Internet operations plus $90 million in cash for a 43 percent stake in the Infoseek Corporation , an also-ran Internet search engine company , which will run Go . Disney will funnel $156 million to Infoseek to promote the new Web site on ABC , which Disney owns , and on Disney 's cable channels . Indeed , Disney will deploy everything from its cruise ships to its theme parks to trumpet Go , just as it stretched its every synergistic muscle for " A Bug 's Life , " its current hit movie . <p> Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which big media companies have repeatedly foundered  --  most notably its rival Time Warner , whose pioneering Pathfinder portal has struggled as more nimble Internet companies have vaulted ahead . <p> At first glance , Disney 's offering has little to distinguish it from the leading portal , Yahoo , which sets the standard for being fast , easy to use and loaded with handy features  --  news , financial data , electronic mail , chat groups and the like . America Online incorporates those same features in the Internet access it provides to half the nation 's wired homes , and it just agreed to buy Netscape Communications , largely for its popular Internet portal . Other rivals abound , including Excite , Lycos , Microsoft 's MSN and Snap , which is backed by NBC . <p> And given that hardly any of these businesses are profitable , Disney  --  with so many opportunities in movies , television and theme parks  --  could have found easier ways to get a return on its investment . <p> Still , Michael D. Eisner , Disney 's chairman , has personally orchestrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic-light logo . He concluded that Disney had no choice but to enter the fray . " We want to be a relevant company , " he said in an interview last week . " I do n't want to have our company be in the railroad business while people are flying overhead in airplanes . " <p> Contrary to much of the evidence so far , Mr. Eisner is betting that " content "  --  the information and entertainment created by companies like Disney  --  will give Go an edge over Yahoo and its kin , which dismiss content as a mere commodity , preferring to link users to information rather than originate it themselves . Though the user 's first encounter with Go is a screen that  --  quite purposely  --  looks like Yahoo 's , clicking on a link to " news " or " sports " or " kids " leads directly to Disney-generated content . <p> And every page  --  along with every other Disney Web site  --  links back to Go , in what the company hopes can become a largely self-contained cyberuniverse . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original Web content . " It 's a very big bet to cast your lot with one group of content sites and assume what is good today will also be good tomorrow , " said Jerry Yang , a co-founder of Yahoo . " We have felt that it is important to stay independent . " <p> But Mr. Eisner argued that as the Internet matured , Disney 's strengths would be more important . " As technology becomes comfortable , the product takes over , " he said , comparing the Internet now to cable television in its early days . " At first , the point was to improve the picture on your broadcast channels . Now it has turned into a product play : How good is the Disney Channel or the Discovery Channel ? " <p> So far , however , analysts who have seen previews of Go say that despite a few nifty features , it does not seem to be anything special . " I do n't see Disney as an also-ran , given how much money they will throw at this , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consulting firm in New York . " But I 'm not sure how many users they can siphon from Yahoo or Excite . " Finding the Pieces <p> As much as Mr. Eisner now extols the Go Network , he was not always so enthusiastic . In March , he assembled a group of key advisers and executives at his home in Aspen , Colo. , to make sense of what Disney should do on line . <p> Portals were hot , and Disney did n't have one . Instead , it had focused its early Internet efforts on developing sites related to Disney content . <p> Beginning in 1995 , it has been building a bevy of family-oriented sites , accessible at Disney.com . In 1997 , Disney bought part of Starwave , the Seattle company that created its ESPN site , from Paul Allen , the billionaire co-founder of Microsoft . It then had Starwave start ABCnews.com . <p> Sitting in front of the fireplace at Mr. Eisner 's spacious house , Jake Winebaum , 39 , the ambitious head of Disney 's Internet group , and Michael Slade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a portal , all Disney had built so far was at risk . <p> " It became clear that if people 's appetite for news and sports was satiated at the place their voyage was starting on the Internet , there would be fewer people coming to our sites , " Mr. Winebaum said in a recent interview . <p> They recommended that Disney buy Infoseek , which was only then beginning to recover from internal conflicts that had sapped its momentum in a rapidly changing market . Infoseek 's new chief executive , Harry Motro , who had started CNN 's Web site , realized that the company needed a big brother and was eager to sell out to Disney . <p> But there was a problem . The $1 billion price tag  --  inflated by the surging stock prices of Internet companies  --  blew the lid off all the rigorous financial models that Disney uses to judge acquisitions . So at the Aspen meeting , Mr. Eisner rejected the deal . <p> " We have a problem overpaying for things , " he explained later . " Our company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I 've got to be careful . " Instead , Starwave was assigned to build a portal from scratch . <p> Through the spring , as other portal companies grew rapidly , Infoseek flirted with other possible partners , including Netscape . Mr. Winebaum kept pushing to find a way for Disney to buy a portal . <p> Then Thomas O. Staggs , Disney 's chief financial officer , hit on a way to gain control of Infoseek for less than $1 billion . Disney had paid $82 million for 42 percent of Starwave , with the option to buy the rest of Mr. Allen 's stake for about $162 million . But with the market for Internet companies so hot , Starwave was worth far , far more than $244 million . Why not come up with a trade ? <p> Ultimately , Disney gave Starwave  --  and $90 million cash  --  to Infoseek in return for 43 percent of Infoseek , a stake valued at about $900 million when the deal was announced in mid-June ; Disney has the option to raise its stake to 50 percent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with money Disney would lend to it . <p> Most important , Disney and Infoseek agreed to build a new portal before the end of the year . Under Construction <p> When Barak Berkowitz walked into a conference room at Infoseek 's headquarters in Sunnyvale in late October , his jaw dropped at the sight of a 30-foot-long wall covered floor to ceiling with a grid of text , lines and little dots . The grid mapped out exactly what had been done and was yet to be done to complete the 30 separate features in the first version of the Go portal . <p> " This is awesome , " said Mr. Berkowitz , general manager of the portal . He was impressed , not because of anything on the vast chart , but because for the first time someone had assembled all the information in one place . <p> " We 're making 30 things for dinner , and we want to make sure everything is done and hot when the bell rings , " said Sue LaChance , a former librarian , who is the project manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ovens , either . " <p> Much of the work was simply an attempt to match the features offered by other portals . For example , Go will have a personal-finance section , with financial analysis software developed by Starwave . <p> Yet each new feature puts more strain on designers trying to keep the service accessible to novices , still the fastest-growing portion of the market . An Internet portal , after all , is a control panel to the on-line universe , with buttons , links and boxes that promise to deliver the canon of human knowledge , a personal relationship with every like-minded user and a catalogue of all goods for sale anywhere . <p> All this has to be designed for small computer monitors , without complex graphics that bog down slow modems , and with the 219 colors that Web browsers can reliably reproduce . And , oh yes , most users wo n't read any of the instructions printed on the screen . Commerce and Content <p> Disney and Infoseek are proud of an innovation , an organizational structure called " follow me tabs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go  --  topics , shopping sites , local information , chat rooms , Internet searching  --  and still see information related to the topic they are researching . <p> At the top of the screen , looking like file-folder tabs , are buttons for each of these sections . Someone looking for sites about fishing , for example , could click the Community tab to find message boards with fishing discussions , the Shop tab to find fishing equipment stores and the Local tab to find fishing holes near them . <p> Ultimately , it 's the shopping section that will be crucial , because Go 's biggest revenue stream is likely to be from commissions paid by on-line merchants . <p> As they can with other portals , users will be able to customize the site , specifying the news topics , stock quotes and sports scores they want to see when they type in go.com . <p> An emerging truism about portals  --  where most of the on-line ad dollars are spent  --  is that not only are users who program these features more likely to return , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable to advertisers . If , say , a California teen-ager types in his birth date to look up his horoscope , advertisers can make sure they do n't show him ads for Florida retirement homes . <p> Of course , there are Orwellian overtones to marketing based on personal information , and Disney , ever image-conscious , has been dampening some of the more aggressive ideas of Infoseek and Starwave . <p> " Disney has geometrically expanded the complexity of what we do , " said Ned Desmond , Infoseek 's vice president for content . " If you bring up the idea , say , of an E-mail service for kids , suddenly you 're on a conference call with 15 lawyers who are dedicated to nothing but children 's privacy . " <p> Disney has also forced Infoseek to swear off the lucrative practice of selling advertisements to pornography sites . <p> But Infoseek  --  which , like Yahoo , has been accustomed to seeing content as just a commodity  --  is winning the battle to keep Go fast and simple , prevailing over an ethos at both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a long fight , for example , Infoseek decided that the news channel on Go would not offer the elaborate graphics and video clips used by ABCnews.com . Rather , Go News will have stripped-down , but faster , news pages from both ABC and other , non-Disney sources . <p> Even so , Infoseek executives argue that the news Go News will distill from ABC and the sports it will draw from ESPN will provide users a richer experience than they can get from Yahoo and its ilk . For example , the news page on many portals simply displays the most recent headlines . Go News will rank stories in order of importance , as determined by editors at ABC . What 's more , every Go page will have a link to the ABCnews.com site for those who want to delve deeper . <p> In the weeks since the schedule chart was posted  --  during which America Online spiced up the contest by agreeing to buy Netscape  --  Disney has tinkered with the timing of Go 's debut . With some areas , like the shopping tab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow as a preview version , with a formal introduction in January . Cross-Marketing Galore <p> When Disney starts to widely promote Go next month , ABC and ESPN viewers will see television commercials that use the slogan " Are you ready to go ? " <p> But what may make the promotion stand out is the sort of synergy marketing at which Disney is the undisputed master  --  the peddling that puts ESPN sports bars on Disney 's cruise ships and stuffs subscription cards for its Family Fun magazine into envelopes containing dividend checks . " I do n't know how many impressions we make on a customer every day , " Mr. Eisner said . " But in most of them , we 'll remind people that if they go to the Internet , they can use the Go Network to find the things they love . " <p> Disney has done it before . For example , in a colorful new Internet exhibit at the Epcot Center in Florida , visitors browse the Web and can have their pictures taken to be placed on personal family Web sites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go name . <p> The Disney Channel features a series of programs about Zoogs , little animated robots that live in the " zether "  --  the space between the television and the computer . Young viewers can play Zoog games on Disney 's main site and send E-mail that may be read by the Zoogs on the next show . The show quadrupled the Disney Channel 's Web site traffic , Mr. Winebaum said . <p> " No one else can do this , " he said . " Not Yahoo . Not A.O.L. " <p> Yet for all the synergies , can Disney learn to survive in the zether , where profits are scarce and size means less than agility ? <p> Mr. Eisner says the formula for Go  --  mixing Disney 's media skill with the innovative agility of small technology firms  --  can work . <p> " One reason we are in business with Infoseek and Starwave is to have people who will turn to us and say , ' You guys are so old and so stupid , ' " Mr. Eisner said . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Disney is entering a crowded field this week as it introduces the Go Network , its new Internet portal . Portals , designed to be entry points to the Web , are the most visited Internet sites  --  and hence , the primary battleground for computer users ' loyalties .
