Broadway 's 1959-60 season , though not a high-water mark in the vanished heyday of the book musical , brought The Sound of Music , Fiorello ! , Carol Burnett in Once Upon A Mattress and Jackie Gleason in Take Me Along . Yet it is probably best remembered among devotees for a show business story called Gypsy , which was based on the memoirs of a stripteaser 's rivalry with her actress sister but evolved into a harrowing portrait of their implacable stage mother , played by Ethel Merman in her final and , many feel , greatest origination of a Broadway role . <P> For actresses , the idea of emulating Merman is intimidating , but the part has proved irresistible . Rosalind Russell memorably played it on film in 1962 . A 1974 Broadway revival brought Angela Lansbury a Tony award , and a 1989 revival did the same for Tyne Daly . Gypsy has never been better told nor Momma Rose more arrestingly played , however , than in the 3-hr . CBS television version to air this Sunday starring Bette Midler . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filmed musicals more complex and less percussive than MTV videos , this is the vehicle to blaze the path . <P> The project is a big risk for CBS , which is paying more than $5 million for two showings despite Broadway 's ordinarily limited appeal on screen , and for the producers . To help offset the $14 million cost , Gypsy will be released as a feature film internationally and perhaps in the U.S. A soundtrack is already on sale . Says Robert Halmi Sr. , an executive producer : " When Bette decided she wanted to do it , that 's when this project came to life . " <P> Midler , who has re-ignited her career with a smash national tour this fall , may be a good choice for getting ratings but she was a risky one artistically . She has always been more of a personality than an actress , more engaging as herself than as someone else , save in her exquisite portrayal of a doomed Janis Joplinesque singer in The Rose . Midler 's style is ironic , mocking , frequently distanced from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gypsy is a desperate , driven woman , unfazed by law or morality in her single-minded pursuit of stardom for her children and , by proxy , herself . Her life is about perseverance , not talent . Irony has no place in her makeup . <P> Nevertheless , Midler long yearned for the role . " The music has always knocked me out , " she says . " It 's one fabulous song after another . " Her showstoppers include Everything 's Coming Up Roses ; Some People ; Mr. Goldstone , I Love You ; You 'll Never Get Away From Me ; Together , Wherever We Go ; and the climactic Rose 's Turn . At a youthful 47 ( she turned 48 last week ) she looks plausible both as the mother of preadolescents and , in the later scenes , as the mother-cum-manager of a mature burlesque star . Says Midler : " I never thought I 'd be old enough to play this part . When you 're very young , you imagine yourself with a lot of padding . As you grow older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more .
