<p> would allow  --  a machine that could scan the entire body , hunt down cancer , and provide images of all the body 's organs . <p> When I first began developing the MR ( magnetic resonance ) scanner in 1970 , I would meet new people and they would ask , " What is it that you do ? " After explaining that I was working on a new invention that would someday scan the entire body noninvasively , hunt down cancer deposits , and provide scans of all the body 's organs using radio signals and magnets , they would commonly respond by saying , " Yeah , sure . " <p> Years later , there are approximately 4,000 MR scanners installed worldwide , and it has become a multi-billion-dollar industry and a world-famous technology . I still meet new people , and they still ask what it is that I do . Now I tell them that I have invented the MR scanner . They still say , " Yeah , sure "  --  and one chap added , " And my uncle 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , looking at it from the inventor 's side , it 's " Yeah , sure " when he starts and " Yeah , sure " when he 's finished , and from his perspective , nothing 's changed . <p> The MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) story itself begins with the first time I ever saw a NMR ( nuclear magnetic resonance ) machine a precursor to MRI . My colleague , Dr. Freeman Cope , called me in 1969 when I was still a young professor engaged in active research at the State University of New York ( SUNY ) Health Sciences Center in Brooklyn . He said , " Let 's team up and use the NMR machine to make the first measurement of potassium in tissue by NMR . " My job was to acquire bacteria from the Dead Sea called halophiles that had 20 times the normal complement of potassium and that would give the experiment a chance at succeeding . Freeman 's job was to run the NMR machine . He had borrowed some time on a machine at a small manufacturer outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potassium signal popped up on the oscilloscope screen the instant we put the bacteria into the machine . We were happy , but I was awed by something else . I observed with considerable excitement , " Good Heavens , Freeman , this machine is doing chemistry entirely by ' wireless electronics . ' " A few days later , still awed by the technology , I said to Freeman at breakfast , " If you could ever get this technology to provide the chemistry of the human body the way it does for the chemist on a test tube of chloroform , you could spark an unprecedented revolution in medicine . " <p> I proposed detecting cancer with it . Freeman  --  envisioning giant magnets , people inside of them , radio frequency antennae wrapped around them  --  considered the idea too wild even for his fertile imagination , but I was hooked . When he asked how I would go about it , I proposed that I felt confident from my salt-and-water research that the water NMR signal of cancer tissue would be different from normal , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around those signals and use them to hunt down cancer deposits in the human body . <p> I think he agreed that this might be correct , but he was n't too enthused about proceeding on such a heroic venture that would take , as he put it , " ten years to convince someone it was sane . " <p> Obsessed with the idea of a scanner that could noninvasively explore the human body for cancers , I returned to my teaching position at SUNY and began immediately to round up rats with tumors in them . Step One for the scanner idea , I decided , was to show for sure that the NMR signal could distinguish between cancer and normal tissue . <p> With a collection of tumor-bearing rats fixed securely in the trunk of my car , I made off for Pittsburgh and the NMR Specialties Company where Freeman and I had done the potassium-bacteria work . <p> After a few days of measurements in the different normal rat tissues , I decided to attempt the cancer measurement . To my mind , this was the measurement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I needed that abnormal cancer signal if there was to be any hope of a human scanner that could hunt down cancer deposits in the body . I held my breath and made the first measurement . It was different  --  dramatically different ! <p> Now I feared it was too good to be true and that I had made the measurement improperly . I repeated it and repeated it , each time getting the same result as I reexamined and tested my method on standard solutions to certify that I was n't fouling up . Eventually , I concluded I was n't . <p> The patent for the full embodiment of the first MR scanner was filed in 1972 and issued from the U.S. Patent Office in 1974 . It was the first description ever of a machine based on NMR for detecting disease tissue in the live human body . <p> With publication in hand and the patent issued , it was n't long before the idea of the body scanner was attracting advocates and detractors . Theoretical physicists claimed to have done calculations demonstrating the idea was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from confounding the funding sources who did n't want to finance something that could n't be done , the claim of the theorists proved amusing to us  --  indeed , a challenge . How often in scientific history does a group of experimentalists like us get an opportunity to do something the theorists say ca n't be done ? We relished that chance . We proceeded to the first step : trying to make the first successful scan of a tumor in a live mouse . This we achieved in 1976 . <p> More success brought more challenges . Chemists , who themselves had amassed more than two decades of NMR experience measuring the NMR spectra of small chemical samples that were spun at around 10,000 rpm , would ask at conferences upon hearing the body scanner idea , " Now , Doctor , how fast do you propose to spin the patient ? " <p> We survived the pundits , though , and managed to convince enough people that the idea had sufficient merit to warrant some funds , at least to build the first human-size scanning machine . Ken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( NCI ) Diagnostics Division , caught the vision and became the inside champion at NCI for the MR scanner . Construction of the first MR machine , which we named Indomitable , commenced in January 1976 . By May 1977 , after many fits and starts in completing the welds on the cryogen apparatus and in obtaining the 10 -9 torr a unit of pressure necessary to support one millimeter of mercury under standard conditions of temperature and atmospheric pressure vacuum needed for the magnet , our homemade 5,000 gauss niobium-titanium liquid helium superconductor ( operated at 500 gauss ) was complete and ready for testing . <p> After performing scans on the full OSCAR FAMILY ( a series of containers of different sizes containing nickel-doped water and artificial air sacs to simulate lungs ) , we were ready to attempt the first live human chest . <p> Here , we had an unexpected problem . No one would get into the magnet . It was finally agreed that the person who most deserved this moment of glory  --  and also the chance to prove that magnetic fields , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the silly fool who thought up the idea in the first place . I was elected . <p> As the project director , I had more privileges than the ordinary sample . I could see to it that I had a willing cardiologist on hand , a blood pressure monitor , a defibrillator and shock paddles , an EKG machine ( connected ) , an EEG , plus an emergency code team equipped with oxygen and a stretcher to deal with the unexpected . The emergency code team left after the first 15 minutes of the scan for the lack of their usual adventure . <p> The problem with the scan , however , was that it did n't work ! All we got for our 18-month effort of building Indomitable was a normal EKG . Mike Goldsmith , Larry Minkoff , and I were sadly disappointed with this result . MR scanning had failed us . Our critics were proved right . It could n't be done . We did n't relish the prospect of delivering the evidence that proved we were , in fact , the fools they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first hypothesis to explain the failed experiment . I was simply too fat for his radio frequency coil , he said  --  " a regular oven stuffer , " as he put it . The antenna coil Mike had built to wrap around my chest to pick up my body 's NMR signals was too small . The largest one Mike had been able to build , up to that point , and still get a signal was 14 inches in diameter . As far as Mike was concerned , I was loading the impedance of his antenna " mercilessly " and we 'd never get it to work . We needed a smaller sample ! <p> Larry Minkoff was perfect . He was thin and an inch smaller than me all around . The problem was , he would n't get into the scanner . <p> After several frustrating weeks of trying to get bigger coils and different designs to work , Larry surprised us by saying he would , at last , get into Mike 's coil and test the scanner . It was July 2 , 1977 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . He said he had decided that " the time for NMR scanning had come " and that , moreover , in the " intervening weeks since I had been scanned , he had n't detected any undue deterioration . " <p> With the good news of Larry 's announcement , . Mike and I worked feverishly through the day to get Indomitable up to speed before Larry changed his mind . We had to get a field on Indomitable 's magnet , verify the vacuum was holding on the seals , establish that her liquid helium level was adequate and not evaporating from some new heat leaks , and be sure that the maze of electronics we had assembled to operate Indomitable for the scan was functioning according to " spec . " It took me the better part of 14 hours to run through the two pages and 50 or so items on my MR scan checklist before we were ready for countdown . <p> By midnight , July 2 , Indomitable was ready . Larry took his upright sitting position on the movable scanning rail inside Indomitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the signal-producing " sweet spot " ( pea-sized ) was centered in his heart . Mike and I rushed to the controls to see if there was a signal . This was where things had come apart on my scan . To our great delight , a generous signal from Larry 's chest greeted us on the oscilloscope . At the same time , we had verified that Larry " had a heart " after all , something Mike had begun to question . The world 's first human scan , after all these months , was finally underway . <p> If Larry had any thought of getting out of the scanner at this point , having fulfilled his plan to " get a signal , " Mike and I hastened to preempt such a move by quickly advancing him to the next scanning location to proceed with the scan . <p> Within a few minutes , the sweet spot was moved into Larry 's lung field , a gas-filled region lacking water and therefore a region where the hydrogen NMR signal should be absent . It was ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successfully focusing within Larry 's chest . <p> We continued to scan , moving inch-wise along one scanning line until the line was completed and then moving the scanning rail backwards one inch to begin a new scanning line . We proceeded in this fashion until 4:45 a.m. , July 3 , 1977 , by which time 106 scanning points , arranged in a rectangular grid , had been collected . <p> Mike and I drew a sketch of this first scan in his book , marked the image with some jubilant exclamatory about achieving the world 's first human scan , and saved the data for Joel Stutman , our computer scientist , to computer-interpolate the raw data and to form , in color , the first human image . <p> The success of the first scan , Mink 5 as we called it , was followed immediately by scans using the same " sweet spot " technique on two patients with malignancies of the chest , and also by a scan of Larry 's normal abdomen . <p> Going ahead of my story for a moment . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disbelief as my achievements were recounted at the induction ceremony for the National Inventors Hall of Fame in Washington , D.C. , humbled by the fact that I was deemed worthy of inclusion in the Hall of Fame alongside the legendary heroes of my boyhood  --  Thomas Edison , Alexander Bell , Samuel Morse , Eli Whitney , Marconi , and others whose contributions created the basis of the Industrial Revolution , from which America has prospered ever since . The year before , 1988 , President Reagan awarded me the National Medal of Technology for inventing the MRI and creating for America a new industry . <p> News of the successful scans soon brought investors eager to sponsor the manufacturing of these scanners . So in 1978 , armed with our patent , we started the world 's first company to make MRI machines  --  FONAR Corporation . Donna , my wife , braced herself for a new round of risk and instability . This gentle lady , the true heroine of MR scanning and without whom there might genuinely be no MRI today , had already kept the home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Timothy , Jevan , and Keira  --  in their all-too-frequent disappointments occasioned by Daddy 's delays at the lab . <p> We sold stock to investors and started trading publicly under the symbol FONAR . By 1980 , our little FONAR company had introduced the world 's first commercial MRI scanner . A new industry was born , an industry that should have inured the American people , but did n't . By 1982 , the Big Companies decided they wanted in . Undeterred by FONAR 's basic patent , Johnson &; Johnson , GE , Siemens , Philips , and more recently , Hitachi , Toshiba , and Shimadzu all introduced MRI products  --  all companies that were n't there for the first ten years of hard work and toil that created the scanner and got it to work . <p> The stresses on our little company began in earnest . FONAR suddenly found itself competing with six $60 billion companies , each of which had marketing budgets that were five times the budget of our entire company . We believed , though , that by applying the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevail against the giants even if we were small . We 'd simply out-invent them ! <p> Over the next few years , we generated more than 80 percent of all the innovations in the industry , racking up a portfolio of an additional 20 patents . <p> It did n't work . Each time we put a new innovation on our scanners , they copied it and had it on theirs in the better part of a year , thereby destroying our selling advantage . In the interim , their salesmen delayed our sales by saying their physicists had determined our new feature could not possibly work ( not work , that is , until it was on their machines ) . FONAR innovations-oblique imaging , multiangle oblique imaging , permanent magnets , iron-core electromagnets , and the first MRI machine on wheels  --  all met the same fate . <p> At last I was beginning to confront the reality that an inventor with a new product in an arena populated by giant predators has only one prospect for survival  --  his patent . If this fails , he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was the sales pitch of the Big Companies . It was so quaint . To each of our prospects , they would say , " You 're not going to buy a $1.5 million product from that little company , are you ? They wo n't be here in five years . " <p> Here 's when we learned Commandment I of the Marketplace : " A little fellow shalt not invent a BIG product . " <p> Confident , though , that the U.S. patent system would come to the rescue in this lopsided struggle , we filed suit in 1982 against the first infringer , Johnson &; Johnson . <p> After a seven-week trial in 1985 , we were jubilant . A Boston jury had found our patent to be valid and infringed . WE WON ! <p> But our happiness was short-lived . The judge who had presided over the case did n't like the jury 's decision . So six weeks later , he voided the jury 's verdict and substituted his own . WE LOST ! <p> Despite this unhappy outcome and the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't afford without a favorable result , FONAR did n't pack it in . Determined , like the little engine that could , that it was not going to sell America out to the Japanese as its competitors had , or worse yet , sell out on America 's future hope for this technology , FONAR pressed on . <p> FONAR did n't want to sell out on America 's inventors either , particularly the aspiring young inventors of tomorrow . We knew America needs them badly , and we knew they needed this victory as much as we did . They would certainly benefit from a win this size . More importantly , we recognized it was the American people who needed the win the most . <p> Despite the absence of the expected help from our patents , we kept on going , selling approximately 140 of the $1.5 million scanners worldwide , totaling approximately $200 million in sales over four years . And we installed them all across the world , too : from Japan to China , to Australia , to India , in every country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico , a minor miracle considering the lopsided advantage of the competition . And little FONAR made a healthy contribution to America 's balance of trade , too . <p> Today , out of seven MRI manufacturers with substantial installations , only two remain that are American . They are FONAR and General Electric . Of GE 's two products , one was developed for them by the Japanese and is manufactured entirely in Japan . <p> FONAR 's MRI scanner is one of three American scanners left out of a field of 21 marketed models from an invention that was entirely American to begin with . Had FONAR 's pioneering patent been upheld by the courts , it would have been different for America . <p> Additionally , scan prices to the public have remained unreasonably high ( approximately $1,000 per MRI scan ) because the patent-holding company was not allowed to prosper by patent enforcement to the extent that expanded sales volume could engender lower scanner prices and lower scan fees . <p> I never expected the MR scan to be so expensive . You perhaps can imagine my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it turn into a $1,000-plus scan . It meant that most people would n't be able to benefit from my invention because it cost too much . It meant my invention had added to the cost of medical care instead of lightening the burden through early diagnosis , as I hoped it would . <p> We are now , however , developing new products to dramatically reduce the cost so the public can have MRI at less expense . We have a product that , instead of selling for $1.5 million , will be selling for $650,000 . It 's a fairly dramatic product , because unlike the torpedo-tube MRI machines , which patients must go through with their arms nearly pinned to their sides , ours lets you stretch out your arms , and for many larger patients , it 's the only one in which they could fit . The vertical space available to the patient in the new scanner has been increased by nearly 50 percent , almost eliminating patient claustrophobia . Medical teams can approach a patient and do surgery while the patient is in the MRI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Another useful feature is that the scanner can be equipped with four beds , which in a screening procedure like breast mammography will allow us to see a patient every five minutes and do 12 patients in an hour , getting the scan price down from $1,000 to $80 . <p> There is no doubt that MRI is far superior to x-ray for mammography . Dr. Stephen Hames at the University of Texas in Dallas did a study in which he asked radiologists to diagnose 75 women using x-ray and MRI . The radiologists did not know that the women were already known breast cancer patients . Using the x-ray mammography , they diagnosed 21 of the 75 patients as negative for breast cancer . In other words , they misdiagnosed 21 of them . When they diagnosed using MRI , they missed only three ! <p> There 's a major need for this kind of product for mammography . There are 70 million women who need it , but if you have to charge $1,000 , that 's not going to fly . I think we 're the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . <p> There is a curious thing that has gone on in MRI . All the other manufacturers of MRI machines also make other medical equipment , and by maintaining the high price of MRI , they have guarded against its becoming a substitute for the various diagnostic modalities they sell . It 's obvious in my mind that MRI is eventually going to replace all the x-ray technologies such as mammography and angiography . <p> The problem is going to be that big companies , like GE , which is selling $1.5 billion a year in x-ray equipment , do n't want that x-ray product line to go away . They 've kept the MRI machine up in the high price category so it can never be an effective competitor for x-ray . With our new scanner , we hope to change that . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Dr. Raymond v.
