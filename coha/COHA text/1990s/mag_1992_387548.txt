Bike messengers bite the dust . <p> Tuesday through Friday nights , the bike messengers congregate at a Washington dive called Asylum for a little-known event , the " Courier Happy Hour . " At 6 p.m. they come skidding in from the streets , Lycra spidermen with names like Beaver , Beetlejuice , and Bam Bam . Concrete cowboys with shaved legs and holstered Motorola radios , scabby knees and earrings , guys who look like some weird cross between Greg LeMond and Sid Vicious . Soon the place is reminiscent of the alien bar in Star Wars , all sorts of interesting-looking beasts and hard-shelled insects hobnobbing in the dim lounge , speaking a strange patois . " Made a major southwest slice , man . Cut a big hole in the traffic in front of this Murphy at Farragut and then I shredded ' em , man , had him eating my dust .... " <p> The conversation often centers on perennial peeves  --  jaywalkers , elevators , security guards , cops , potholes , tourists , Capitol Hill metal detectors , suddenly opened car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This cabbie 's cutting me off , so I kick in his fender . Then the prick flips me the bird . So at the light I take out my radio , ride up to his window , and bash him good across face , like this . " <p> The war stories told at Asylum are tinged with the doom of a dying profession . " Send it by courier " was the catch phrase of the Reagan-era workplace . Not only was a bike messenger fast and dependable , he was your slave for the hour . The courier epitomized the inflated urgency of the times . Sending it by regular mail would n't do . You needed hot colors , physical toil , the fanfare of having some coolie handing over a document in person . As a result , courier companies became a multimillion-dollar cottage industry in the ' 80s . Messenger work appealed to a new class of urban malcontents who saw a way to find personal expression on a bike , while earning $800 a week or more , depending on how fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romanticized in the movie Quicksilver , starring Kevin Bacon . " On the street , I feel exhilarated , " Bacon 's character rhapsodizes . " I go fast as I like , faster than anyone . If the street sign says one way East , I go one way West . They ca n't touch me . " <p> But by the turn of the decade , telecommunications technology caught up with the bicycle , and the new watchwords of the officescape were " Fax it , " or " Send it e-mail , " or " Modem it in ascii text . " Today the bike messenger finds himself sprinting against fiber-optic lines like John Henry racing against the steam engine drill . Anyone who works in downtown Washington has probably noticed that there are n't as many bike messengers as there used to be . The number of courier outfits in metropolitan Washington has dwindled from approximately seventy in 1988 to around thirty today . Five years ago , more than 700 bike messengers plied Washington 's streets ; today there are fewer than 300 . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs and turn smaller profits . <p> Asylum is a smoky , fermented space above an Ethiopian restaurant in a derelict section of Northwest Washington that was torched during the 1968 riots . The house drinks are Voodoo lager and Jagermeister shots . It 's the kind of club that attracts extremely pallid people in extremely black clothes who go for obscure local bands : Clutch , the Meat Puppets . Asylum is the only bar in town that welcomes bikes inside . The messengers like to haul their battered Bridgestones and Cannondales up the stairs and arrange them in a dense , circular formation known as a " clusterfuck . " It 's a symbol of group solidarity that dates back to the days when the couriers used to hang out at D.C. space , a now defunct downtown club where they had to park their bikes outside . The messengers would lock their rides together  --  as many as 100 at a time  --  to keep them from getting ripped off . <p> Once they 've stashed their bikes , the couriers begin to peel away their elaborate exoskeletons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sideview mirrors , the velcro arm pouches and slick sheathings , the bad-ass gauntlet gloves with the fingers ripped out . They sidle up to the bar for the night 's first Jagermeister shot , yelling their order over whatever skull-cruncher music happens to be emanating from the Asylum tape deck . <p> At Courier Happy Hour you meet people like Scrooge , a quiet , imposing figure in Olympian good shape with ocher skin , matted dreadlocks , and missing front teeth . At 41 , Scrooge is the dean of the Washington bike messengers . He works with Action Couriers ( Dispatcher #135 ) and makes about $500 a week . " We do real work , " Scrooge boasts . " And we 're good at it . We 're like the Pony Express , man  --  heroes , thirty times a day . " <p> Scrooge 's friend Suicide is a rangy , gregarious , hyperactive man with a sponge of frizzy hair and various black leather strips and thongs dangling from his appendages . A veteran messenger of nearly a decade , Suicide won his nickname @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headband on the streets . It was Su , as he is known to friends , who first organized the Courier Happy Hour at Asylum , where he sometimes tends bar . <p> Suicide also aspires to be the Eugene Debs of Courierdom . He wants to organize Washington 's messengers and strike for better wages . Courier companies take advantage of them , he insists . Since messengers are considered " independent contractors , " companies refuse to pay benefits or worker 's comp . " If we could have a work stoppage , " he says in brittle tones , " you 'd hear it around the world ! This city would grind to a halt , man , just completely shut down ! They would never fuck with us again . " <p> Su misses the halcyon days of the late ' 80s . Then , he and Scrooge used to play in a rock band called Scooter Trash . Among their more popular songs was " Happy Trails , " a raucous sledgehammer of a tune that became something of an anthem for D.C. 's messengers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they should , " Su would sing : TABLE <p> The few messengers who are still around tend to be diehard romantics , a leaner and meaner breed scrapping for a dwindling number of pickups . They know that , beleaguered as it is , the courier business is not likely to vanish anytime soon . There will always be vital documents that must be notarized , blueprints to be hauled crosstown , depositions and payroll sheets in need of signatures . The laws of human procrastination being more or less constant , one can assume there will always be people with packages that absolutely , positively must get there in fifteen minutes . And there will always be a handful of American business districts  --  New York , Boston , Chicago , San Francisco , and Washington  --  where crowds and thick traffic make bicycle travel the only practical form of express delivery . <p> The couriers are detached from the establishment that depends on them  --  and they like it that way . As much as they may hate the drudgery of their jobs , they share a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city 's food chain . Once Scrooge was called upon to deliver a fish to a taxidermist ; another time it was a six-pack of " sample bricks " from the National Brick Institute . Once he delivered $6.5 million to a Washington bank . Messengers sometimes get calls from government fat cats who 've left an umbrella at a restaurant or a shirt at a hotel room tryst . They even get paid for waiting in lines . Say a lobbyist wants to be guaranteed a seat at an important committee hearing on the Hill . Instead of waiting in line himself , he 'll pay a messenger to save a place for him . " That 's our job , man , " Suicide says with a raspy laugh . " To do dumb shit for people . " <p> Even so , Scrooge says that many of the " squares " he passes on the street would gladly trade places with him . It 's hard for deskbound wonks not to envy the couriers . They 're in terrific shape . They get to be buccaneers every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they never get hung up in traffic . What 's more , they do n't have to answer to a real boss , only a disembodied voice crackling over a radio . <p> The bike messengers who do n't go to Asylum usually hang out at Dupont Circle after hours . At dusk they ride up to the white marble fountain with six-packs of Heineken in their fannypacks , unclip their Shimano shoes from the pedals , toss their " brain buckets " on the grass , and fall into the easy , familiar body language of boon companions . Scrooge coasts over on his Trek aluminum . He nods at Suicide , who is splayed out in the grass sipping a bottle of HydraFuel . Heavy metal pours from a blaster , and a couple of West African drummers are on the far side of the Circle . " Murphy ! Murphy ! " someone squawks over Scrooge 's Motorola , code language for " cops ahoy ! " Scrooge passes the word on to the other bike messengers  --  " Murphy ! Murphy ! " Thirty seconds later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Dupont Circle and noses his patrol car beside the fountain . <p> Couriers love to hate the police . The antagonism animates them . They scramble to clean up the scene , stash their beer cans in the shrubs , snuff out their joints . Murphy jumps out of his car and , inexplicably , slips on a pair of rubber gloves . He forges into the crowd with an eye toward busting somebody or impounding an unregistered bicycle . The messengers whisk their bikes off the pavement and stand defiantly in the officer 's path . <p> " You got ta problem , Murphy ? " demands one of the messengers . Murphy sniffs the air suspiciously , then scowls at the wall of fluorescent Spandex . " Go home , Murphy ! " Murphy gives them the evil eye , but finally relents . He slips back into the patrol car . <p> The West Africans resume their polyrhythmic pounding . Scrooge and Su sit on the fountain wall , eating bean burritos . Scrooge says he 's thinking of trying out couriering by Rollerblade . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the way of the future . " But right now Scrooge is spending most of his free time noodling on his new laptop computer . He 's thinking of publishing a courier newsletter . And he 's got bigger plans afoot  --  a hacker 's dark conspiracy . " I 'm going to create a virus that will ruin all the fax machines . You know , kind of like a Michelangelo for faxes , " he says . " I 'm gon na send it out over the phone lines like an epidemic . Then watch out . All the bike couriers of the world will unite ! And we 're going to take this country by storm ! " <p> By W.
