 --  The microprocessor acts as the brain of the computer , and it doles out instructions for every component <P> A computer consists of hundreds of parts , including a monitor , mouse , disk drives and keyboard <P> Inside the computer is a circuit board . It houses all sorts of microchips , including those for ROM ( read-only memory ) and RAM ( random-access memory ) <P> Mounted on the circuit board is a microprocessor , which is housed in a protective container and connected to rows of gold-plated pins <P> Inside the microprocessor package is the chip itself . This tiny square of silicon is packed with transistors that process instructions and data for the computer <P>  --  Scientists have managed to squeeze millions of transistors onto each chip <P> Each transistor on the surface of a silicon chip acts as a switch that can open or close a gate . Computers process information by manipulating sequences of opened and closed gates . A positive charge applied to the gate attracts electrons , allowing current to flow across the gap from the source to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gate <P>  --  A Pentium II chip can process 500 million instructions every second . Here 's how : <P> Information flows into the chip ... The bus interface unit retrieves data and instructions from the computer 's main memory ( RAM ) <P> Information goes either to a code cache , which stores the instructions that tell the processor what to do ... <P> ... or to a data cache , where the data to be processed are stored until needed by other parts of the microprocessor <P> ... where it 's processed ... <P> The branch predictor unit anticipates the most likely path the instructions will take , thus getting a head start on the work <P> The instruction fetch and decode unit translate instructions into simple operations that the execution units can perform <P> The reservation station and reorder buffer determine the most efficient order for instructions to be processed <P> The heart of the chip is its execution units . They perform various operations and send results back to the data cache <P> The floating point unit handles mathematical operations on the largest and smallest numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data cache ferries the processed information to the bus interface unit , which in turn sends the results to RAM
