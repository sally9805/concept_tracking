Whites have always bitten off black culture ( the beatniks , rock ' n ' roll , everything Quentin Tarantino has ever done ) . It gives them that cool , outsider image they so desperately need . But over the past few years , black kids have been taking fashion cues from the whitest of the white : ski gear , polo shirts , hiking boots , N.H.L. jerseys . The gold chains and dangling clocks of the ' 80s have been replaced with sweaters in bright primary colors with polo embroidered on the front . Jeans are in , but the baggier the better . Ski jackets are pumped up to Michelin Man proportions . Things have got freaky , albeit in a decidedly unfreaky way . <P> For the past three years this baggy-preppy scene has been dominated by giants like Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger , but now more than two dozen tiny African-Americanowned labels are beginning to steal some of their cool . And even a little bit of cool can be worth it : it may look like merely oversize jeans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is growing faster than any other apparel category except , perhaps , lingerie . And how long before Hilfiger offers low-slung panties with his name on the butt ? <P> Boutique labels like FUBU , Naughty Gear , Phat Farm , Pure Playaz , UB Tuff and Wu-Wear can legitimately claim  --  as they do , over and over  --  closer connection with street fashion than Hilfiger has , even though their clothes look a lot like his . But that street cred , along with their funky logos , is helping them gain ground . FUBU , which means " for us , by us , " began in 1992 when Daymond John , at 24 , started selling tie-top hats on the streets of New York City . The hats caught on , so he drew up some ideas for coats and shirts and asked his mom to teach him to sew . Then she remortgaged their house for $100,000 , gave him the money and let him turn the place into a mini-factory . He has a really nice mom . <P> In 1995 John and his three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Las Vegas ; they sold $300,000 worth of clothing in just a week . Soon after , Samsung America agreed to distribute their $69 shirts and $800 bubble jackets to hip boutiques like Dr. Jay 's and Casual Male on the East Coast . Last summer Macy 's began carrying the line in its 10 East Coast stores . " That was like cutting our own album and headlining above Michael Jackson at Wembley Stadium , " says John . <P> Even more than hard work , luck or an agreeable mom , FUBU 's success was due to a strategy straight from Phil Knight 's playbook : it got the ubiquitous LL Cool J to sign an endorsement deal . The trick to hip-hop-fashion money , even more than offering slick styles , is somehow to get a rapper  --  preferably one on heavy rotation on MTV  --  to wear your stuff . Dr. Dre is dipped in Karl Kani , Mase gets giggy in Mecca , and Busta Rhymes is decked in Ecko . " Videos are hands down the best advertising you can have , " says Mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ label started by the rap group Wu-Tang Clan , all of whose members wear it constantly . " It 's the best way to cross over . " And those who ca n't yet afford an official-endorsement deal send free outfits to as many famous people as they can find addresses for and hope they will wear the clothes in public . Celebrities who have worn Wu-Wear include Icelandic singer Bjork , the rap metal band Rage Against the Machine and athletes Ricky Watters and Shawn Kemp .
