Christina Ricci takes on her image as an angry , fun , hazardously sexy teen who will say anything <p> Christina Ricci is in Paris , where the Diet Cokes come with spoons in the glass  --  to cut the fizz  --  but where , for her , everything else is much the same , a European variation on the life she 's lived since age nine . A car to a set , PAs calling her to the studio , a car speeding her home to bed through the dark . This afternoon , Ricci tugs on a pair of earphones in a red-curtained soundstage . The nineteen-year-old is smallboned , with a large head and wide cheeks  --  as with many actors , her face is like a flat drive-in screen on which other people ( screenwriters , directors ) can project emotions . <p> A French recording engineer hovers nearby  --  thick accent , microphone , denim shirt . " Do you want to hear the old line ? " he asks . <p> Ricci shakes her head . " No , that 's OK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being an astronaut  --  all that personnel , cable and equipment brought together to help you lift off . Ricci has come to the outskirts of the city to rerecord a single line of dialogue for the film Sleepy Hollow . Director Tim Burton 's $80 million fantasy thriller , in which Ricci and co-star Johnny Depp fall in love while solving a colonial town 's beheading problem , will open in a few weeks . For Ricci , the movie is a milestone , her first big-budget project in four years . <p> Ricci plays Katrina Van Tassel  --  " She 's young , romantic and blond , " Ricci explains  --  and Depp is Ichabod Crane , a New York constable , circa 1799 , with many newfangled ideas . In the scene , Ricci is leading Depp on a walking tour of Sleepy Hollow . The actress closes her eyes . slips into the faint English accent that filmmakers have agreed is the voice of the past . " This land is Van Garrett land , " she says , precisely , four times . <p> Ricci removes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scripts are being rustled and consulted . The French engineer silently passes a clipboard to Ricci . " It 's the is , " he says . " You are supposed to say was . " <p> " Oh , " Ricci says with a laugh . " OK . I 'm sorry , my mistake . I 'm retarded . " <p> Ricci slips on her earphones . " This is Van Garrett land . " Everyone protests : was . " Fuck . This was Van Garrett land . This was Van Garrett land . " <p> Is and was have become the defining words of Ricci 's career . Five years ago , she starred in a film called Now and Then , a coming-of-age drama with a gimmick : You saw four young girls and the women they would become . That 's what Ricci 's whole life is : a series of nows and thens , of dissolves and new scenes . First she 's a schoolgirl , then she 's a nine-year-old actress in a New York hotel room for a press junket . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ films , including two monster hits : Casper and The Addams Family . Then she disappeared for a while , retreated to the private backroom where actors suffer breakups , comedowns , disasters . Many child actors finish selling what they have early  --  an extra , energetic childishness , which once they turn adult is beside the point . Four years ago Ricci lost weight , put on weight , climbed into bed thinking she 'd failed forever . Today she 's in Paris , with a driver , with her boyfriend , with her dog , with a new film to shoot . <p> In 1989 , Ricci was co-starring in Mermaids with Winona Ryder , who talked about her then-boyfriend , Johnny Depp ; ten years later , Ricci is acting love scenes with Depp . One year ago , when The Ice Storm , Buffalo ' 66 and The Opposite of Sex were released within nine months of one another , Ricci cemented a screen personality for herself : a stormy , manipulative teen with a hazardous sexuality . She also crafted an offscreen personality for herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considers this an error . " I misinterpreted something along the way , " she explains . " I 'd get annoyed in interviews , and my way of being annoyed was to be sarcastic and shocking . People would be , like , ' So , you were in The Addams Family  --  do you like death and stuff ? ' And I 'd say , ' Yeah , I love it . ' ' Cause it pissed me off . And then people started responding to that . They 'd be like , ' God , you 're so angry  --  and fun . ' And I thought , ' Oh , yeah , this is it . I 'm holding onto this . ' " Now , that 's become part of the was , too  --  a reputation to be lived down . " I 'm not , like , this crazy , angry person , " Ricci says . " I 'm  --  boring . " <p> At an outdoor Paris cafe , Ricci ransacks her big pony-hair bag for a lighter , locates a cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Ricci is like entering a reverse Twilight Zone , where everything is perfectly normal . The actress loves dogs , the TV show Friends , home decoration , the actress Jennifer Love Hewitt . " I 'm obsessed with that girl , " she says . " I mean , I 'm a teenager , and all that stuff is aimed at people my age . " A poodle jumps by . " Look at how cute that fucking dog is  --  the dog 's manic . " <p> In the middle of eating , Ricci pops a Wellbutrin pill . " Anti-anxiety , " she explains . " They smell like shit . Here , smell them . " Ricci 's family members , she tells me , were " all a bunch of control freaks . " Her parents had a rocky marriage , and ever since childhood she has fought the urge to manage  --  " you know , appease people , keep the peace . " <p> Ricci reads my notebook upside down . I 've written what she 's wearing : cargo pants , long-sleeve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have green eyes , " Ricci says . " They 're usually brown or yellow . I 'm all bloodshot today , ' cause I 'm tired . " <p> Ricci 's wide eyes told casting agents she was taking in everything , and her tiny mouth  --  all curdled , wicked disappointment  --  told them that she would n't forgive a lot . Of the many routes into acting , one is by acting in the family : placating , managing , smoothing , wishing away , lying . Ricci has two histories : There 's the family history , which is about regular Christina , and the movie history , which is about what she calls fabulous Christina , and she alternates between the two . When she put on weight and stopped getting cast in films , Ricci must have worried that regular Christina was taking over forever . <p> In a sense , Ricci 's whole life has been shaped by the movie business . She was born in Santa Monica  --  big house , beach smells from the water . Sarah , her mother , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a New York therapist who migrated west to get into Hollywood . Ricci was the youngest of four children  --  brothers Dante and Raphael ( if Christina had been a boy , she 'd have been named Titian ) , sister Pia . Her father practiced therapy with actors and directors , then crossed over into agenting for his clients . When Ricci was two , her father had partners , a thriving business . <p> One day , her mother told the children they were redecorating ; they would pack up and move for a while to their summer house in Montauk , Long Island . " She told us it was a secret , " Ricci says , lighting a cigarette . " It was very dramatic . " Her father lost about $1 million in the business . Broke , the family hunkered down in their unwinterized beach house for four years , until Ricci was six . <p> Yet Ricci 's happiest family memories are of Montauk . " I loved it , " she sighs , remembering the house : big white gate , sailboat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much money , but I was so little , I did n't realize . It was just fun . " After four years , the family had saved enough money to sell the house and move to a proper suburb  --  Montclair , New Jersey . <p> All along , Ricci had been acting ; but when a kid does this away from directors and studios , it usually ends up being called lying . " I would make things up , because I did n't think I was interesting enough , " Ricci says . When things were tense in the house  --  Ralph and Sarah arguing about money , Ralph griping about the kids  --  Christina would run through the kitchen screaming , " I 'm being chased by a ghost . " A crisis team came to educate her second-grade class , and she told them she was in crisis , to see what they would do . " ' Cause I wanted to be one of these kids who had some horrible story . My family thought it was hysterical . <p> " I was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Ricci says . There were little moments , dinner moments , when the family got tense : arguments , " some wooden-spoon action . " Ricci would slip away from the table , take off all her clothes and run back streaking through the dining room . Or she 'd shove a pillow under her shirt and pretend to be " a really fat man . " Or she 'd give her father a neck massage , make a joke , anything . <p> When she was seven , Ricci was cast in her school 's Christmas pageant . Her part was a girl who wants a basketball but whose parents instead " keep getting her all these weird-ass things . I was very disgruntled . " It was Ricci 's first shot at playing the role she has played ever since  --  a girl not quite getting the right things from her family . <p> A mother in the audience spotted something else : A girl who keeps holding out for one specific gift she wants is a girl who can sell products . This mother had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sarah that Christina could do it , too . Soon , Christina was advertising credit cards , Quaker Oats , dolls , curtains . " I did a lot of voice-overs , " says Ricci . " I had a really young voice , but I could read really well . And most kids could n't . I was shocked at that . " <p> Movies came next . At eight , Ricci auditioned six times for the role of Cher 's youngest daughter and Winona Ryder 's sister in the weeper Mermaids . Flying home from the final audition , to be dramatic , Ricci lied and told her more she saw an angel near the wing of the plane . It turned out Cher liked her . That 's the touch-and-go way a life takes shape : Cher likes you , and eleven years later you 're shooting your twenty-sixth film , in Paris . <p> Ricci is meeting friends at the Louvre , a few blocks away . " That 's one thing I want to ask you , " she says . Ricci is careful with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once burned them . " You can say anything bad you want to about me . But do n't say anything bad about the people we 're going to meet . They 're innocent bystanders . " When the waiter brings our check , I explain that the magazine will cover it , and Ricci watches the waiter leave . " We should 've gone somewhere more expensive , " she says . And so , because Ricci is pragmatic , a fast learner and a person who follows through on what she says , the next places we eat are much , much more expensive . <p> Ricci 's three friends are waiting near the museum . All of them are very nice people . There 's Kate Jones  --  blond , tall , thirty  --  who was Ricci 's assistant during Sleepy Hollow 's six-month London shoot and who has come to Paris to work on Ricci 's new movie , The Man Who Cried , which also co-stars Johnny Depp . There 's Kate 's boyfriend , Antony , who has a job with British television . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Frauman is slim , handsome , with deeply incised face lines ; he looks like Tom Cruise playing the Scarecrow part in The Wizard of Oz . ( I do n't know if Ricci would consider this mean or not . ) <p> Once inside the Louvre , Ricci is at liberty . Sometimes she kids with Matthew , jokes about paintings , asks why tourists take pictures of them . " I guess it 's for proof , " she says . Other times , she turns quiet , drops into thoughts of her own . Her friends have the same effect on her that Wellbutrin might : a kind of insulation , like sandbags protecting her from powerful internal tides and floods . Frauman asks Ricci to demonstrate her double-jointed arms . She stretches ; her sleeves ride up ; there are raised round scars on her forearms , burns on the back of one hand . She later explains where each mark came from : how she heated a lighter , held it against her hand , a stunt to impress some boys when she was angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scratches come from soda tops and fingernails : " It 's like having a drink , " Ricci says . " But it 's quicker . You know how your brain shuts down from pain ? The pain would be so bad , it would force my body to slow down , and I would n't be as anxious . It made me calm . " <p> Ricci has spent a good deal of time in museums  --  not finding out about art , but learning how to be more self-conscious . Years ago , a creative executive on one of her movies took an interest in her ; he told her that what mattered was not what you did but what you thought about while you did it . " He would take me to museums , and we 'd stand in front of paintings for a really gratuitous amount of time , until I had an interesting thought , " Ricci says . " Then he 'd question me on what I was thinking  --  so I became really aware of it . I was too young to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was creating the perfect wife . I was fifteen  --  there was nothing sexual about it at all . " <p> As Ricci glides past cracked Greek sculpture and old master paintings , a heavyset young woman in a Tori Amos shirt slips to her side ; the girl falls into the blushes and stammers that are the international symbol for recognizing a celebrity . She asks if Ricci would mind posing for a picture with her ; she tells her she 's attending college in Paris for a year  --  it 's her first time away from home . Ricci listens patiently . Here is a girl she might have become , if she 'd never been an actress . When she leaves , Ricci says , " That must be scary , being alone . " <p> From the moment she stepped on the Mermaids set , Ricci has spent the most important parts of her life away from home . During the first movies , her mother was her chaperon . Films were immediately a better deal than school or family life : Instead of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chores , Ricci was handed a script . When she did n't feel like doing schoolwork , " I would hide in Cher 's trailer , because my tutor was too intimidated to knock on her door . " And there were PAs everywhere  --  twenty-five-year-olds , kids with first jobs and walkie-talkies . " I just flirted with them all day long , " says Ricci . " And they 'd flirt with me and , like , carry me around . I was convinced they were all in love with me . " Ricci laughs . " Secretly . And I could just imagine them crying at home , because I was n't old enough for them . At that age , I thought I was really foxy . " <p> For Ricci , everything on the set was a lesson : how to be an actress , how to be a woman . She 'd go into Ryder 's trailer , where the older actress would tell her secrets and ask Ricci to light cigarettes for her . ( " I was like , ' No , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ryder were talking about someone on the set being gay , and Ricci wanted to know what it meant . " So Winona put me on.the phone with Johnny , " says Ricci . Depp explained approaches , medical theories , lots of specifics . When he dropped by the set , Ricci was all over him , and Ryder told Cher , " She 's flirting with him . " " And I remember thinking , ' I 'm not flirting  --  he 's in love with me , ' " Ricci says . <p> When Ricci was ten , she was cast in the part that made her famous : Wednesday , the frosty daughter in The Addams Family . For the first time , Ricci was told not to smile ; she no longer had to make believe she was from a happy family . ( " I hated that , " Ricci says . " People telling me to smile  --  just because they could , ' cause I was n't an adult . " ) Ricci found the part she has played , in different versions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that her parents might be no better qualified to lead the family than she is . Co-star Anjelica Huston was so impressed , she steered Ricci to her agent , who has remained Ricci 's agent since . Kim Basinger was filming at the same studio . " She had this huge-assed trailer , " Ricci recalls . " And I slipped a little note under her door . I just wrote , " ' You are the most beautiful woman I 've ever seen  --  Love , Christina . ' " <p> Basinger 's assistant found Ricci ; a few days later , Ricci was brought into Basinger 's trailer . " And she was wearing just a bathrobe , and her hair was all out , and I just thought , ' Oh , my God , this woman 's so fucking beautiful . And she was so nice to me , too , ' cause everyone 's nice to little kids . " Nine years later , Ricci flew up to Canada and acted with Basinger for a few days in a movie called Bless the Child . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I 've gotten used to things like that . " Basinger did n't remember her . She laughed at the story and then told Ricci how much she 'd liked her in The Addams Family . When that film was released , people kept congratulating her . " I remember , um , Gene Siskel coming up to me after a screening and telling me that I was really good . And being , like , really impressed with myself . " <p> The Ricci family flew along on the movie 's junket , camping out at hotels in New York , Los Angeles , Paris , at Paramount 's expense . " It was really exciting , " says Ricci . " Junkets  --  I love junkets . Most of the time , you do n't feel like a movie star or whatever . Um  --  but when you 're on a junket , you do . " As a child actor , Ricci put a fourth of her income into a trust fund . The rest was going into family expenses ; like a young athlete , Ricci @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year later , when Ricci filmed the sequel , Addams Family Values , the movie was centered around her . But anxiety was beginning to creep in . " In rehearsal , they sort of mentioned to my mother that I had started to get a little hefty , " says Ricci . " So then I started doing the Cindy Crawford workout video . I loved that video . " How did Ricci get heavy ? Movie sets offer what 's called craft services : plates of cookies , candy bars , potato chips , boxes of cereal you can slip in a pocket . " Well , a kid and a craft-services table  --  I mean , come on , " says Ricci . " And it 's not like you get any exercise while you 're shooting . Candy , Twinkles . I would actually try to work in candy bars  --  like , ' Should n't I be eating a Baby Ruth in this scene ? ' " On the L.A. junket , Ricci 's sister blew up at her for her behavior . Ricci 's self-consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something else : She felt like an actress . " During the second Addams Family , I sort of thought , ' This is really fabulous , ' " she says . " I liked the lifestyle . I liked my trailer . And I liked my school room , and I liked having four PAs watching us all the time . " A year later , she was working on Casper  --  playing Kat , the levelheaded caretaker of her dad ( Bill Pullman ) . Casper was the first film where Ricci was billed above the other actors . " It meant I was really special , " she says , laughing . " Just like I 'd always suspected . " <p> It 's a rainy Paris monday : wet streets , clogged avenues . Because Ricci has been granted a day off , she drops by the Paris Versace . Her friend Kate becomes what Ricci calls " Mommy Kate " and helps Ricci pick clothes . ( A little while later , Kate notices a bathroom and tells Ricci , " If you need a toilet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belts : one leather and silver , one with turquoise beads that look like they might be used as currency in Fiji . They are pricey  --  at the exchange rate , near $550 each . While Ricci is in the dressing room , Kate mentions something to the sales staff  --  women in black , with Ally McBeal bodies  --  who suddenly become very excited . One of them asks , " Is she from  --  the Family of Addams ? " I nod . " Ooh la la , " she says ; it is the first time I 've ever heard a French person actually utter the phrase . <p> A few minutes later , a thickly built man in a black suit shakes Ricci 's hand and tells her the store will offer the actress a thirty-percent discount  --  a sort of appearing-in-movies bonus . The total is 11,578 francs  --  nearly $2,000 . The salesgirls have gotten the relationships squared away ; they hand the bag not to Ricci to carry , but to Kate . <p> Somewhere between The Addams Family sequel and Casper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken to her father since . Add to that the pressures of puberty . Casper included Ricci 's first extended kissing scene . " I can be kinda snappy when I 'm embarrassed , " says Ricci . Her kissing partner , Devon Sewa , bore the brunt of it : " I scared the shit out of that kid . " <p> At school , regular Christina was also feeling a little shaky . " I was really flat-chested , and I was considered a prude , " she says . " I stopped feeling fabulous around age eleven . I got much less confident and more angsty ; I think it had to do with boys not ilking me . " Ricci began idolizing the girls boys did find fabulous , in the same spirit in which she now idolizes Jennifer Love Hewitt : Sasha Lubowski , Phoebe Malice , Catherine Hart . " They were just gorgeous , " Ricci sighs . " Catherine Hart  --  she was so beautiful . I would have fucked her . She had a beautiful house , really nice parents , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillows and a lightpink carpet . Everything about her was tasteful and pretty and easy . " Ricci had doubts about herself . " This is so subversive and awful , but I started thinking that people just could n't see how fabulous I really was . " <p> During this stressful period , Ricci happened to see two unfortunate things at the same time . First , she came upon a still of herself from an old movie , " and I remembered thinking my arms looked so fat . " Then she saw the Tracey Gold portrait-of-an-anorexic TV movie For the Love of Nancy . " This film is supposed to make you not be anorexic , " Ricci says . " But I was like , ' Damn  --  good drama . ' So I sort of willed myself into it . " <p> Ricci had her reasons . " I thought it would be fun to be sick , " she says . " I wanted people to want to take care of me again . ' Cause people are so nice to you when you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me . So I think I sort of needed something else to get attention . All of a sudden , I was a teenager , and everything I did was much more impressive when I was little . I really loved it when I finally got skinny enough that I could buy stuff in the children 's section . " Ricci ate salad once a day and slept face down , with her fist jammed against her abdomen , " so that I could feel my stomach being hungry . " After six months , Ricci had fallen from 110 to 80 pounds and looked like a Popsicle . <p> High school in New Jersey had also become complicated for Ricci . She was anorexic and scared . Her siblings were all in college or working . The summer she was fifteen , Ricci and her mother moved to New York , to a Tribeca apartment . The money came from Ricci 's trust fund ; she and her mother would borrow against it . " The apartment was so fucking expensive , " Ricci says . " And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ricci enrolled at the Professional Children 's School , where the other kids were actors and dancers . She resumed normal eating , but anorexia plays tricks on the metabolism ; in one month , she gained thirty pounds . " I was chunky  --  I was fat , " she says . " It 's weird weight , too , ' cause you just look puffy and strange . " It had been almost a year since she 'd had any acting offers . She was a junior in high school , and there were bills to pay . Ricci was offered the lead in the remake of That Darn Cat . Her mother said , " It 's good money . " Ricci felt disgruntled ; she 'd joke with the producer , " I ca n't believe I 'm doing this disaster . It 's pathetic . It 's so cheesy . " <p> After the shoot ended , in January of 1996 , Ricci climbed into bed and essentially did n't get out for three months . She ballooned from 110 to 135 pounds . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But I was pretty damn thick . " She did n't want to make any more Darn Cats but knew she 'd have to if that 's all that was offered ; she 'd need the money . " I was really depressed . I was just sleeping all the time . And I would n't go to school . I would go maybe Monday , have an anxiety attack , and then be in my bed for the rest of the week . " Ricci ca n't explain why she had anxiety attacks , but she knows why she was upset : " I felt like a failure , like I had really fucked up . And I knew it was my fault . It was a dull panic . My career and my life never seemed separate . It was like my life  --  and I was ending it . I had caused my life to stop , in a way . " <p> Ricci has turned careful . But there are rumors she ca n't control , like one that linked her romantically with Johnny Depp during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a London restaurant and walked to a hotel bar . " They just assumed that Johnny was staying in that hotel and I had gone up to stay at his room , " she says . The next morning , Depp brought the tabloids to the set : " It was hysterically funny . Johnny said that it was a really good rumor , and what we should really be saying is that he and I have been having a secret longterm affair since we first met , since I was nine and he was twenty-seven . " <p> Ricci began constructing her new press image after making The Ice Storm in 1997 . The movie became a point of release , a place to bury the bad feelings of a year . Director Ang Lee had one repeated direction for Ricci : " Less angry  --  you like him . " When The Ice Storm premiered at Cannes , Ricci had to walk the gantlet of paparazzi , and co-star Kevin Kline literally took her in hand . " We were walking in , and he realized I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , so he held my hand , " she says . " He kept telling me under his breath , ' OK , now look to the left . OK , we 're waving . We 're walking again , we 're walking , we 're smiling . Are we smiling , Christina ? We 're smiling . We 're waving . ' " <p> After Ricci graduated from high school , things started happening very fast . " I did n't really stop feeling like a failure until after The Opposite of Sex , " she says . The film was many things  --  a comedy , a number of love stories  --  but it was also a series of shots of her breasts . For the first time , Ricci was a sex symbol . " Director Don Roos was obsessed with my tits . He 's upset now because they 're smaller than they were . " Ricci speaks of her breasts in the factual way you might speak about a friend who steals all the attention and takes all the best lines . " Then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to like me , so I thought , ' OK , so I 'm fabulous again . ' " <p> Outrageous , too . When reporters sat down with her , Ricci reveals , " I felt like I had to deliver . " Suddenly , instead of streaking to lighten up the atmosphere in her living room , Ricci is streaking across the whole country . For example , she has always loved the book Les Enfants Terribles , about a brother and sister who begin an incestuous affair . " So this reporter says , ' Oh , incest , huh ? You like incest ? ' And I was like , ' Yeah , it 's amazing , and really natural , and everyone should have sex with their siblings . ' " Next thing , it 's all over the papers . Another interviewer asks if Ricci would have liked to play The Diary of Anne Frank on Broadway , as actress Natalie Portman did . " And I thought that was a rude question , " Ricci says . So she said that no way would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was a good thing at first , " Ricci sighs . " And then it got out of hand . " <p> Ricci is back in her trailer the next morning . Another dissolve : Ricci is smoking , in a white bathrobe , in full makeup , and looks as glamorous as Kim Basinger must have looked to her when they met a decade ago . It starts to rain , and Ricci closes the windows of her trailer . <p> I ask about her boyfriend . Two years ago , Ricci went out with her pal Gaby Hoffmann , met Frauman and moved in with him . " I just never went home , " she says simply . It was as if , after the anorexia , after getting that last accelerated dash of childhood , she never wanted to be a child again under a parent 's roof . A year ago , Ricci and Frauman purchased a house in the Hollywood Hills , where Ricci plans wall colors , furniture patterns and curtains . When she gets bored , they walk their dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of how Frauman heard two guys at Blockbuster talking about her breasts . " Like , when am I gon na show them , in movies , " she says . " It upset him . I mean , would you want somebody talking about your girlfriend 's tits ? It makes me uncomfortable  --  the idea of little boys in their parents ' bathrooms , jacking off to me . Yuck . " She laughs . <p> " It was so funny  --  we were shooting the other day and I had my first sex scene with Johnny . And he 's so nice , and so the whole experience was not bad at all . But before I was doing it , I was so uncomfortable and so nervous . I was in the trailer , I was talking to the makeup woman . And I was like , ' I 'm never doing a movie with a sex scene again , never ever . ' Later on , I thought , ' No , I 'll be doing sex scenes for the rest of my life .

She has passed through many of the problems her characters have passed through . The parts being written for kids got dark just when Ricci 's life began turning in that direction . A couple of years ago , people began wondering what kind of children our era was going to turn out . Gloomy kids , watchful kids ? Ricci , in her life and work , has become one of the ways we can find out  --  a floating reference point . I ask what she finds so interesting about Jennifer Love Hewitt and Sarah Michelle Gellar . " I think maybe it 's left over from childhood  --  that obsession with Catherine Hart , just transferred , " she says .

Co-stars John Turturro and Cate Blanchett are starting an affair in this scene , and Ricci is supposed to watch and record without saying a word . The studio is a mock-up of Paris ; tiny Parisian rooftops , tiny Parisian windows , a dignified old limousine with the camera in front . Ricci slips into the back seat with the other actors . The crew gently rocks the vehicle , simulates the lighting effects of a car speeding someplace in the dark . Ricci thinks quiet Ricci thoughts while the other actors speak their lines ; she smokes , plays with the handle , fiddles with the window .
