<p> Feeling endangered : Frustrated independents see their numbers dwindle . <p> Tullahoma , Tenn. - Steve Ennis does n't want to see his family-owned business go the way of the nickel Coke . <p> But every year , Ennis says , it gets more difficult , more frustrating and less satisfying to be a small-town , independent Coca-Cola bottler . <p> The price the Coca-Cola Bottling Works of Tullahoma Inc. pays for ingredients and packaging goes up every year , but what Ennis can charge his retail customers never seems to budge - thanks to the competitive Pepsi bottler down the road . <p> Bigger bottlers that have bought up most of the turf around him make it hard to expand . And with the Wal-Marts and Winn-Dixies of the world striking regional deals on prices and promotions at the corporate level , he feels a growing loss of control . <p> " It 's hard work , " he says . " And it gets tougher every day . " <p> Worst of all , he feels that Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co. - Big Coke , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it used to be . <p> Coca-Cola wo n't cough up much marketing money to support the many mom and pop shops and independent grocery stores he serves , Ennis says . <p> Dr. Pepper 's machines <p> The company is n't generous about helping pay for vending machines , he says , so he gets them from Dr Pepper - which pays half . And it has n't been cheap or easy to accommodate the new products and packaging that have spewed from the company 's North Avenue headquarters recently like a shaken-up soda . <p> " Coca-Cola 's our main brand , it 's the heart of our business , and we 'll continue to sell them and make it grow - it 's in our best interest , " said Ennis , 52 . " But we feel like we still should do that as a partnership , and that partnership is eroding and becoming one-sided . <p> " It is one-sided . And it 's not on our side . " <p> Across the country , hundreds of other small-town bottlers have already done what Ennis hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more frequently , to one of the so-called master bottlers . <p> The largest of those is Coca-Cola Enterprises , in which Coca-Cola has a large stake and a very favorable contract . ( The small independent bottlers say it " spells out who 's the master and who 's the slave . " ) <p> From a peak of 1,263 bottling operations in 1928 , there are now only 118 - and the 10 largest crank out close to 90 percent of the bottles and cans sold in the United States . <p> The consolidation has been spurred by forces at both the macro and micro level . On the macro level , those forces include the advent of the interstate highway system ( the original territories were based on how far a mule could go in a day ) , the invention of expensive but speedy production lines that fill 1,200 cans a minute , and the retail industry 's own consolidation into national chains . <p> " We saw the market mix and the dynamics of the industry changing , " recalls Frank Barron , who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sales date , July 31 , 1986 , of his family 's Rome-based bottling company as readily as his own birthday . <p> " You had to get big or you were going to get swallowed up . " <p> At the micro level , consolidation advanced when companies were passed down to children who did n't care , or when bottlers got too tired of fighting North Avenue , whether in court or on the phone . <p> All of which means the remaining handful of small-town , independent bottlers - once the backbone of the Coca-Cola system - are now more like a sixth finger . Unnecessary . Maybe even in the way . <p> " The small people are having a harder time having any influence on the company today - and that 's because they obviously do not have that much impact on the marketplace , " said Marion Glover , who formerly worked for Coca-Cola and now works as a financial adviser to independent bottlers . <p> " That 's kind of sad , but that 's just the facts , " he concludes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literally gave away the bottling rights to a pair of Chattanooga lawyers , Coca-Cola and its bottlers have waged outright war several times over the original 1899 contract and subsequent amendments . At least four times , they have landed in court . <p> Two of the biggest cases were decided , largely in Coca-Cola 's favor , just three years ago . <p> Those cases were filed in the early 1980s by Atlanta attorney Emmet J. Bondurant II . He , and Elizabethtown , Ky. , bottler Bill Schmidt , led the charge on behalf of a steadily shrinking group of independent bottlers who have refused to sign any contract amendments since 1921 . <p> About 80 were involved in the suits , but by the time the cases were decided in 1991 , only 30 remained who had not sold or signed the amendment . The number of so-called nonamended bottlers now stands at only about a dozen . <p> While they 've raised hell in the past , Bondurant said at this point , " It 's in the best interest of my clients not to say anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. Douglas Ivester , who was named president in July , to make a special plea at a meeting of independent bottlers this summer . <p> Let 's bury the hatchet and concentrate - together - on selling more soda , he asked . Ivester has also landed the company plane on many small- town airstrips in the last two years to make the pitch in person . <p> " We 're not going to be putting any pressure " on bottlers to sell " from this time forward , " Ivester said in an interview . " We have the critical mass . The system is working well for us . There 's no reason for either us or the small bottlers to have a dialogue that in any way hampers that prosperity . " <p> Ivester contends the company has instituted several programs to help both large and small bottlers , and that those charging otherwise " are not representative . " <p> Several bottlers and professionals who 've worked closely with them over the years say frustration is common but that individual bottlers do n't complain publicly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , say they see hope that a new , more harmonious chapter might be starting . They cite Ivester 's efforts and the seeming willingness of new Coca-Cola USA President Jack Stahl to listen and learn . <p> " The most polite way to say it is that what is being said is listened to , even if in fact they do n't agree with it . Whereas in the past if they did n't agree with it , they turned it off , " said Bobby Wilkinson , the new president of the Coca-Cola Bottlers Association who runs a small bottling operation in Huntsville , Ala . <p> " I think it 's definitely warming up - though I got good friends who would n't agree with that . " <p> A tall shadow <p> Indeed , the tall shadow cast by the North Avenue tower still frequently feels chilly to Ennis . <p> He 's gotten the Ivester visit but was n't bowled over . And while he was encouraged by the talk from top Coca-Cola executives at a meeting of small bottlers last week , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , is the true test . <p> Twice in the past year , Ennis said , the company disputed who should be charged what - and he had to " kick and scream " to get Big Coke to split the difference . <p> " That 's getting to be more of a common type thing - to have to fight ' em over who 's spending your money , " he says . " It 's kind of like the federal government , " he says . <p> " We 're willing to spend our money , too - that 's part of the partnership arrangement , " he says , digging his hands into his khakis and shaking his head in frustration . <p> " We work hard , " he continues . " We 've got a good management team . We 're trying to stay up-to-date and modern , reinvest in the business , do n't pay out a lot of dividends . <p> " Now , there has been some real dogs , " he concedes , referring to other small-town bottlers . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . But those of us bottlers who are working the system , who want to be part of it , and keep growing , ought to be able to . " <p> The struggle makes it less and less likely that the dream embodied in a 20-ye ar-old picture that hangs on the wall of Ennis ' no-frills office , crammed with Coca-Cola memorabilia , will ever come true . <p> The picture shows Ennis , his father and his 2-year-old son decked out in red-and-white-striped Coca-Cola shirts and holding Coke bottles . When it was taken , the future seemed certain : The 2-year-old would , surely , wind up running the Coca-Cola Bottling Works of Tullahoma Inc. someday . <p> That may still happen . Twenty-two-year-old Jordan Ennis is taking a job with another bottling company to earn his stripes , then plans to get an MBA . But now , Ennis is n't sure that Jordan should plan to take over the company , as much as Ennis still wants him to . <p> " My concern is the viability of this business 20 years from now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in selling . My family 's not interested in selling , and I hope we do n't have to get to that position . But if it gets to the point where there 's no opportunity to grow , then the smartest thing may be to try to get out of the business . "
