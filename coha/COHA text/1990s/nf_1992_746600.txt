A system 's ability to continually improve demonstrates its effectiveness . Curriculum audit criteria require a school district to show productivity through : Congruence among objectives , results , and financial costs ; selection of specific means to attain better results ; and planned interventions that raise and maintain student performance levels within cost parameters . Productivity review requires investigation of all sources reporting outputs of district inputs , including testing and other feedback data . Auditors focus their analysis on linkages among goals , feedback , allocation of resources , and decision making . The budges process should be curriculum driven and participatory . The productivity standard presumes that decisions about resource allocation and program direction will lead to improved results . <p> Reviewing a school district 's curriculum management system brings into focus its comprehensive efforts to serve students successively . However , it is the system 's ability to improve results over time that demonstrates organizational effectiveness most profoundly . Standard Five of the Curriculum Audit , The School System Has Improved Productivity , addresses this factor . The criteria for the standard are : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and financial costs ; Specific means that have been selected or modified and implemented to attain better results in the schools over a specified time period ; and A planned series of interventions that have raised pupil performance levels over time and maintained those levels within the same parameters as in the past ( English , 1988 ) . <p> These criteria for Standard Five recognize that neither the school board , superintendent , principals , nor teachers completely control all of the critical variables to improve pupil performance . However , it is expected that the system is taking identifiable , rational steps toward improvement . <p> Auditors focus on a cycle of results , costs , and improvement in Standard Five analysis . To determine the school district 's productivity gains , auditors observe the linkages among goals , direction , feedback data , interventions , allocations of human and financial resources , decision making , and results over five to ten years . Standard Five Criteria Planned and Actual Congruence Between Curriculum and Costs <p> Several assumptions underlie the concept of congruence , or curriculum driven budgeting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defined and that levels of achievement may be measured . The premise that results can be translated into program needs suggests that needs and program priorities change over time . Program needs can be expressed as budget requests . It is generally accepted that budget requests exceed available financial resources . Curriculum driven budgeting assumes that assessment data may be used to establish priorities , thus creating a financial plan that is congruent with program needs . <p> As the clearest and most comprehensive reflection of a school district 's allocation of resources , the annual budget/financial plan needs to take a programmatic form for ultimate demonstration of the linkage of goals , costs , and results . Budget priorities will be reflected in system goals and programs . <p> If the congruence requirement is met , the annual budget reflects the organization 's allocation of resources to goals and priorities established in advance of budget decisions . To achieve the congruence , a school district needs breadth and depth of participation in the budget development process . Decentralized budget decision-making is not necessarily the best route to accountability or appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processes have been seen to abrogate the school district 's responsibility for system-wide results and equity . The tighter and more system-wide the district 's assessment measures , the greater the need for centralized budget decisions . But centralized budget development can and must involve principals and teachers to better ensure that proposed interventions and solutions to problems are reality-based and accurately represented in the decision-making process . The participation must include three critical features : ( 1 ) Dialogue focused on needs , goals , and priorities ; ( 2 ) propositions that link interventions to program criteria and identified problems ; and ( 3 ) resource plans that guide and support implementation of improvement strategies . These factors force the curriculum , which is linked to goals and priorities , to drive the budget . Otherwise , the financial plan and student services are driven by pre-determined funding allocations directed from a data vacuum . Specific Means to Attain Better Results <p> A school system customarily uses several steps to improve results , particularly as measured by student performance assessment . These may range from curriculum review and textbook/materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and placement of personnel , performance evaluation philosophies and procedures , and promotion or advancement of personnel also reveal a district 's productivity improvement efforts . Typically , a systematic approach to improvement identifies assessment results in the budget proposal narrative . Discussion of assessment results might also be seen in board minutes . A Planned Series of Interventions to liaise Pupil Performance <p> When the efforts to improve result from specific performance feedback , a district may plan an intervention strategy . One strategy might be to reorganize the instructional staff , addressing weak areas revealed by assessment results . Another might be to adopt different instructional materials to improve alignment of the curriculum . Commonly , specific programs might be developed to address specific student population needs . Staffing of intervention strategies is only one way auditors see the linking of priorities to results . Provision for staff development and training in areas of critical need is another . Data Sources <p> Standard Five uses documents , interviews , and site visits as data sources in assessing the school district 's productivity in accordance with the curriculum audit standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the budget , budget development forms and related process documents , and annual external financial audits and management letters . Other sources useful to developing a comprehensive productivity assessment are accreditation and other external reports , strategic or long-range plans and updating documents , assessment data , policies , and Board meeting or work session minutes related to budget decision discussions . <p> The annual budget document is a primary data source in Standard Five assessment . One audit assumption is that a structured and logical relationship must exist between the curriculum and the budget . Reviewing all of the budget-related documents allows an auditor to trace the evolution of the annual financial plan and assess its connection with the curriculum and with district-wide as well as individual school needs and priorities . Auditors study evidence of the use of adopted goals , feedback data , and research sources in annual financial planning . Often , evidence is found in the memoranda and request/revision/ranking forms used in the budget development process , which reflect a range of requests differentiated by levels of service and relationship of the funding levels to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial audit reports are also valuable . Fiscal problems noted in the audits may reflect impediments to curriculum and instruction productivity if poor management of resources prevents appropriate priority allocations . Examples noted in some curriculum audits are chronic over-expenditures of particular budget areas that impact resources available for curriculum priorities , non-compliance with legal or regulatory requirements that impact student achievement opportunities , and cost inefficiencies . Management letters accompanying financial audit reports likewise may provide notes on system control or operational problems which impact productivity efforts . <p> Considering productivity requires a look at any data reporting output of various district inputs . These may be such documents as test score summaries , student grades analyses , achievement progress reports , or the familiar " report cards " prepared by districts or other agencies . Interviews <p> Interview sources for Standard Five analysis usually include board members , administrators , teachers , and occasionally representatives of the community . Interviews reveal the extent to which decision makers consciously use systematic , program-driven decision making to guide the district toward improved results and achievement . Questions asked by auditors in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interviewees , but the questions have three common threads : ( 1 ) Linkage between curriculum goals and priorities and the budget , ( 2 ) participation roles in the budget process , and ( 3 ) the rationale and data bases for budget decisions . Site Visits <p> Productivity is assessed primarily through documents and interviews , but site visits also offer opportunities for data collection . Auditors find visual evidence of attitudes and messages related to achievement and success , those consistent or inconsistent with espoused missions and goals . They assess the capability of the physical plant of a school system , including its equipment and auxiliary services , to support the educational enterprise as described in policy , plans , and the budget . The environmental factors are recognized in Standard Five as enhancements or impediments to productivity because they influence the ability of people within the system  --  professionals and " clients "  --  to realize progress toward goals and desired outcomes . Standard Five Summary <p> Productivity , then , refers to the relationship between the costs , or all resource " inputs , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or " outputs " . Productivity occurs when the same or improved results are achieved with the same or fewer costs over time . Standard Five analysis for the curriculum audit comprehensively unveils the organization 's productivity .
