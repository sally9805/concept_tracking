<p> When Japan 's largest Toyota dealer asked his boss if he could start selling Fords , he was told yes . But the real answer was no . <p> The boss 's eyes gave him away . They " contradicted his words , " recalled Norio Katsumata , the dealer . It was clear Toyota did n't want Katsumata to do something that is practically unheard of here - help a foreign competitor . <p> Katsumata signed with Ford anyway . Now the mega-dealer - who sells more cars than any dealer in the world from his 250 Toyota showrooms - has five Ford outlets . <p> Ford is building momentum in Japan - and not just because it snared Katsumata . Sales of imported Fords tripled last year . The Mustang , introduced last spring , is the darling of the country 's automotive press . The super strong Japanese yen has made it nearly painless for Ford to match or undercut Toyota , Nissan , Honda and Mitsubishi on prices . <p> Just as important to Ford , though , the iron embrace between Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly is n't happening at a fast enough pace to please most U.S. corporations , President Clinton and U.S. trade negotiators . This week , the president will decide whether to slap stiff tariffs on Japanese-made luxury cars in retaliation for Japan 's alleged failure to open its auto and auto parts markets . <p> But as Katsumata showed , there are cracks in the wall Japan 's auto industry has erected to keep out competition . And those cracks could help Ford reach its long-term goal in Japan - a goal that seems almost impossible but that the automaker plans to shoot for anyway . <p> In a nation where non-Japanese producers are lucky if they sell a few thousand cars a year , Ford is on a mission to grab 5% to 10% of Japan 's auto market . That would mean selling 325,000 to 650,000 vehicles a year . <p> Ford 's plans call for half its Japanese sales to come from imports - mostly Fords made in the USA . Half would be Fords built in Japan by Mazda , which is 24.5% owned by Ford . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Five percent is outrageous , " says Stephen Usher , auto analyst at Kleinwort Benson in Tokyo . " Ten percent is simply unbelievable . " <p> But the president of Ford Japan shows no concern . The goal , set by Ford CEO Alex Trotman , is challenging . But , " I feel no pressure , " Konen Suzuki says . He is confident Ford will reach its target . <p> Despite Ford 's recent success , the company has only 5.2% of the import market and 0.7% of the overall market in Japan . The entire imports category accounts for only 6.6% of Japanese auto sales . <p> The obstacles foreign automakers face are daunting . <p> Japanese auto dealers traditionally have leaned heavily on manufacturers for financial backing and other help . Many are directly managed by the automakers . Most dealers who have sold imports have done so only because the manufacturer has struck a deal with a foreign automaker to sell a small quantity of vehicles . The arrangement has forced the Big Three to go through Japanese automakers to get into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan to keep a tight leash on dealers who would like to sell U.S. imports . <p> U.S. trade officials have accused Japanese automakers of trying to prevent their dealers from doing business with Ford and other foreign automakers . <p> Suzuki , Ford Japan 's president , agrees . He has called on Toyota to ask that Katsumata and others be allowed to sell Fords . It is a delicate process that is even more complicated because he used to work for Toyota and because Japan 's automakers wo n't acknowledge that their dealers can not act independently . <p> " The manufacturers are trying to prohibit their dealers from doing business with us , " Suzuki says . But " as Japanese , they probably are not using direct words " to threaten maverick dealers . <p> But financial strains weighing on dealers and a relentless assault by U.S. trade officials are changing the situation . <p> Ford has recruited six Nissan dealers and last year sold 46,205 vehicles - 14,766 imported Fords ( vs. just under 5,000 in ' 93 ) and 31,439 Mazda-made Fords . <p> Katsumata @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it easier for other Toyota dealers - Japan 's strongest - to do the same . <p> Ford Japan wants to expand its current network of 300 outlets by adding 100 this year - and 300 more by the end of the century . The company wants half its new outlets to come from domestic-brand dealers , whether they merely add Ford showrooms to their existing operations or convert to Ford dealerships . <p> Despite the problems it faces , there is no denying Ford 's momentum in Japan . Only two years ago , General Motors imports outsold Ford imports nearly 3-to-1 in Japan . Last year , Ford sold 39% more than GM . Ford also moved past Chrysler last year in import sales . Mostly on the strength of right-hand drive Jeep Cherokees , Chrysler sold 13,028 imported vehicles here in 1994 . <p> Driving Ford 's sales : <p>  --  Cars that are smaller than the vehicles Japanese have typically thought of when they picture American autos . They 're also more fuel-efficient and built specifically with Japanese drivers in mind . Last year , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Japan , where traffic moves on the left , as in Britain . Along with the Mustang , Ford 's Taurus and Probe models are doing well . <p>  --  Prices that come within 10% of competing Japanese models . Taurus wagons sell for 3.1 million yen to 3.6 million yen , vs. 3 million yen to 3.4 million yen for Toyota 's Scepter wagons . Taurus sedans , at 2.9 million yen to 3.4 million yen , beat Toyota 's Crown , which costs 3.3 million yen to 4.2 million yen . Fords sold here also typically cost 50%-65% less than models from such European producers as BMW and Porsche - but that 's mostly because those automakers are targeting the luxury market . <p>  --  A marketing campaign - with the slogan " My First Ford " - that stresses reliability . The company has run full-page ads in 40 newspapers nearly every weekend since the end of 1993 . Ford hopes to convince more consumers that not all U.S.-made gaisha - foreign cars - are lemons . <p> Industry observers have been waiting for Ford to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year - by lowering its prices . But Suzuki says there are no price cuts in the works . Analysts say he is reluctant to chop prices because Ford 's sales growth is straining its dealerships and making service and parts difficult to obtain . <p> For now , Ford is concentrating on its campaign to recruit dealers . The company recently put the Ford name on Autorama - the dealer network it shares with Mazda . <p> For Suzuki , who has spent the last four years waiting for Ford to give him the kinds of vehicles ( small , efficient , right-hand drive ) that are now starting to sell , the hardest work is just ahead . He knows getting Japanese dealers to buck their manufacturers and sign with Ford , as Katsumata did despite his boss 's unsaid order , wo n't be easy . <p> " This is the most difficult market in the world to penetrate , " Suzuki says . " If we ca n't destroy the current distribution system , we can not penetrate the market . " <p> Ford 's own trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan : grabbing a 5% to 10% share of that nation 's auto market . And the company wants half the cars it sells to in the USA . For now , Ford 's sales of cars exported to Japan are relatively small but larger than Chrysler 's or General Motors ' . <p> Big Three vehicles sold in Japan , 1994 <p> Ford 14,766 Chrysler 13,028 General Motors 7,619 <p> Vehicle sales in Japan and the USA Japan Car dealers 17,000 Sales 6.5 million <p> USA Car dealers 22,850 Sales 14.1 million
