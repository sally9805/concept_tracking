Learning how to get the most out of your guide could make or break your hunt . Gordon Phillips and I slipped along the trail in the pre-dawn dark , using the moon and starlight to guide us in the Wyoming forest . We had 45 minutes to get to our destination , a place that Phillips believed would hold elk . As we traveled , we worked our way through grassy meadows that were scattered throughout the timber . Each of the meadows seemed like it would be an ideal feeding area for elk , but the guide kept going , with only one objective in mind  --  a small basin nestled in a grove of aspens . I thought about questioning Phillips ' strategy , but instead bit my tongue and kept walking . Shooting light had barely arrived by the time we reached the edge of the basin and peeked over the top . " Damn , " Phillips hissed , staring out across the opening . " They 're already headed out the far side . " I looked to see a bull and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot was out of the question , as the elk were 600 yards away . " We might be able ambush them in the timber , " the guide said . " Let 's go . " We wasted no time trotting around the rim of the basin , and 15 minutes later we were sitting in the forest , watching a stand of lodgepole pine . Once again I began to wonder about Phillips ' judgment . After all , I could see no reason why those elk would pass through that spot . The forest was vast , with trails running everywhere . And most were imprinted with elk tracks . My thoughts were interrupted by the lusty scream of a bull  --  almost within bow range . I shouldered my rifle , strained to see into the trees , and finally picked out the bull at the same time as Phillips . The animal was a dark shape in the shadows , but I saw his chest and part of one antler . Moments later I was standing over the bull , a fine animal with 26X7 rack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was the third day of a six-day hunt with Dunoir Outfitters ( 307-265-7935 ) , owned by Bob Ingram and Billy Snodgrass . The camp , one of the finest I 've ever been to , is located a few dozen miles from Dubois , Wyoming . It is smack in the middle of prime elk country , and is an easy nine-mile horseback ride from the trailhead . A temporary back problem had been causing me problems getting around during the hunt , and this made the bull on the ground that much more of a welcome sight . I knew that I owed my success to my guide 's savvy and knowledge of the country we were hunting . It 's a known fact that guides can make or break a hunt . That 's why I 've always wondered why dozens of articles are written about selecting an outfitter , yet I 've never read one that discusses guides themselves . After all , it 's likely to be the guide who will be vital to your success or failure . I 'm the type of hunter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but because of the number and variety of hunts I go on each year , I often have no choice but to take guided ventures . Furthermore , guides are required for non-residents in most Canadian provinces and foreign countries , for pursuing certain game species in Alaska , and for hunting in wilderness areas in my home state of Wyoming . I wish all of my guides were like Gordon Phillips . But they are n't . Unfortunately , you often are n't the one who selects your guide ; the outfitter will do that . Does this mean that you have no options but to follow a strange person through the woods and hope for the best ? It might seem that way , but there are a number of things that you can do to improve your hunt . If you 're an urbanite and not in top physical condition , chances are good that your guide will be far superior to you in his ability to walk , climb , ride a horse , and every other physical aspect of the hunt . Add to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , and you may well find yourself lagging far behind with severe aches and pains . The solution to this dilemma is not to swallow your pride and force yourself along , as some hunters do , but to sit down with your guide and inform him that he 'd better match your pace , not vice versa . What you do n't want is a serious medical problem . Heart attacks are not uncommon during strenuous exercise , especially at high elevations . Some guides walk so far ahead of their clients that spooked game will easily escape before the hunter has a chance to see it . That 's another good reason to keep a short distance between you and the guide . According to veteran Montana outfitter Keith Rush , who runs a dozen hunting camps and an intensive guide school each year , it 's important to communicate with your guide . Rush trains his students to talk freely with clients . " The guide is working for the hunter , " Rush said . " He should keep the hunter 's safety and comfort in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and talking to the hunter about the hunt strategy . " Sometimes I 've had problems between the guide and hunter because they just did n't discuss a misunderstanding or disagreement . It 's a whole lot better for the two of them to sit down on a log and have a heart to heart talk , rather than to hold the problem inside until it simmers and blows up . If a horse is standing on your foot , you tell it to move , or it 'll hurt a whole lot more as it stands there . Same thing goes for working out differences between a guide and hunter . " There may be times when you 'll question your guide 's decisions , but you can generally count on his judgment , as I did with Gordon Phillips . Unfortunately , I 've known some guides who should have been slinging hamburgers in a fast food restaurant instead of leading people around in the woods . Those types , luckily , are the exception . It 's logical to assume that your guide will look after every matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dangerous assumption . More than once I 've been with guides who either forgot their flashlights , or had one with weak batteries . I 've known guides who never carried a Band-Aid , and some who never bothered to carry a backpack with routine gear . For that reason I always carry my backpack , whether I 'm being guided or not . It contains everything necessary to get me through a night in the woods . You should do the same thing . Do n't try to second-guess your guide , even if you are experienced and feel he is making lots of mistakes . Some guides seldom look through their binoculars  --  if they carry them at all  --  and some simply have difficulty seeing game , binoculars or not . If you 're faced with a guide who seldom looks up from his boots , it 's best to chat with the outfitter back in camp , rather than have a confrontation in the woods . If the mail I receive is any indication of attitudes on guided hunts , there 's no question that plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each year . The number-one complaint is poor guides . Outfitters ca n't control weather or the behavior of game in their area , but they can control camp accommodations and the quality of their guides . If you look at a guide 's job description and the money he makes , you 'll understand why a career in guiding is temporary , at best . A guide may work 15 to 18 hours a day , most of them physical hours , and make $100 . This equates to a little more than minimum wage . It 's no wonder that good guides are hard to find . I 've known plenty who left the guiding business to work in construction , in the oil fields , or in other more lucrative professions . Some of the best guides I 've come across , such as Gordon Phillips , are businessmen who take a few weeks off each year to work in hunting camps . They 're easy to get along with , they know the country well because they return year after year , and they 're good outdoorsmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , macho individual who looks the part to be good , either . One of the best guides I ever hunted with was Debbie Overly , a petite woman who stands five feet high and probably does n't weigh 100 pounds . She and her husband , Terry , run Pioneer Outfitters out of Tok , Alaska , specializing in Dall sheep . Overly guided me on my hunt , and she was as tough and knowledgeable as any guide I 've ever known . She guided me to a fine ram on that hunt , and dressed , caped and helped me pack the meat back to camp . Tipping is a perennial question among hunters . How much and who do you tip ? One outfitter I know , who runs expensive wilderness hunts , suggests 10 percent . Many outfitters recommend an average of $100 for a deer or elk hunt . Of course , as in any tip , the amount should reflect the satisfaction with the services provided . If your guide worked especially hard for you , you might give him more . Many hunters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In many camps the cook is tipped , too , and again the amount depends on your satisfaction . If a wrangler packed your meat out , a tip to him might also be in order . Guided hunts can be besieged with unfortunate problems . Chances are good that your guide will do a fine job , but be prepared for the worst . You can help avoid problems by hiring on with a reputable outfitter , but even the best must sometimes make last-minute personnel changes . A good hunter/guide relationship is based on trust , respect and communication . Do n't be surprised if you make some long-lasting friendships out there in the woods . It happens all the time . FROM THE GUIDE 'S SIDE To get the other side of the story , I asked a number of outfitters and guides what they feel is the biggest fault of hunters . Following are four individuals who gave the answers that I heard most often . * Lynn Madsen , an outfitter/guide for Petersen 's Hunting Camps in Afton , Wyoming , says that too many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more before they leave home , " Madsen said . " Some of them are either terrible shots , or they are n't capable of shooting long distances . In my country , a 200-yard-plus shot is often average . " * Henri Poupart , owner of Safari Nordik , based in Montreal , Quebec , is probably the biggest outfitter in North America , with an average annual clientele of about 800 caribou hunters . " Hunter attitude is often a big problem , " Poupart said . " They have high expectations , and if they do n't fulfill them , they are unhappy . Caribou are migratory animals . We do everything in our power to get hunters into animals , but sometimes weather and caribou movements are uncooperative. " * Jack Atcheson , one of the biggest booking agents in the world , as well as an experienced outfitter and guide , has headquarters in Butte , Montana . Atcheson claims that too many hunters ca n't see game . " I 've been with plenty of hunters who simply could n't spot an animal that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There 's not much a person can do about it in preparing for a hunt , but it 's terribly frustrating for the guide . " * Ron Dube , past president of the Wyoming Outfitter 's Association and owner/outfitter of Bear Track Outfitters in Cody , Wyoming , hunts elk and sheep in remote wilderness areas . " One of my biggest complaints is hunters being out of shape , " said Dube . " They come on a hunt totally unprepared for the physical requirements , and expect me to perform miracles . Though I use horses a great deal , hunters must still be able to walk , hike and climb . " Try to keep these things in mind when preparing for your next guided hunt . Remember that nothing is guaranteed , and that rewards are often proportional to the effort made . If you head out with the right mental attitude and physical abilities , you 'll make things easier , not only on the guide , but on yourself , as well .
