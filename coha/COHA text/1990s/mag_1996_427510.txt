<p> Imagine a Caribbean getaway where traffic lights do n't exist , green monkeys outnumber tourists , and profanity is prohibited by law . Welcome to Nevis . <p> Rent a car on the tiny Caribbean island of Nevis and get ready to get lost . Streets are n't marked , houses are n't numbered , and no traffic lights exist . Ask directions in the capital city of Charlestown and an easygoing Nevisian might wave you toward Happy Hill , past Hard Times , around Pelican Point , over to St. John 's FigTree , or on to Chicken Stone . Listen carefully , because once on the main island road  --  the major thoroughfare has no name other than " the main island road "  --  the only pedestrians you 're likely to encounter are strutting hens and crowing roosters . To add to the confusion , you 'll be driving on the left side of the road , Brit style . <p> This is the island where fast meets slow , and slow always triumphs . Here , golf carts brake for goats on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper is an eight-page distillation of The New York Times faxed from the city to offer vacationers the barest of essentials : the closing stock market quotes , a killer crossword puzzle , and reports of dreary weather being endured by the folks back home . <p> If this is paradise  --  and many say it is  --  patience and perseverance are required to access its sandy shores . The trek to Nevis is an exercise in island hopping , beginning on Puerto Rico , moving to St. Kitts , and ending with a half-hour boat trip across a two-mile channel . The rewards are worth the sacrifice , though , and even the journey serves a purpose . City dwellers bent on changes of scene and pace have time to wind down , kick back , and prepare for a place where profanity is prohibited by law , green monkeys outnumber tourists two to one , and hospitable residents  --  all 9,300 of them  --  are determined to pamper their guests outrageously . Even veteran vacationers , accustomed to crossing off names of competing destinations with been-there-done-that abandon , find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and urging their friends to do the same . <p> " About 80 percent of our guests are referrals , " says John Maycock , sports and recreation manager of the Four Seasons Resort , the opulent property that has emerged as the yardstick by which other resorts measure their facilities , amenities , and service . " People do n't come here just to lie on the beach ; they come for the golf , tennis , snorkeling , and windsurfing . " <p> They also come to see what the fuss is all about . In the five years since it opened , the Four Seasons has earned an assortment of honors usually reserved for more established resorts in more predictable locales . A poll of international travelers last year designated Four Seasons Nevis as the best destination in the world , nosing out perennial favorites on Hawaii and in Hong Kong , Bangkok , and Paris . The American Automobile Association has repeatedly given the property the coveted Five Diamond Award  --  making this hotel the first and only Caribbean getaway location to receive this particular accolade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read accounts of Four Seasons ' attendants who roam the beach and golf course with trays of iced towels , cool drinks , and bottles of chilled Evian to spritz on the faces of guests . They 've heard about " the coconut man " who spends his work days scaling the property 's coconut trees in search of ripened fruit that might drop on the paths and startle visitors . They 've been told that a guest who craves a dish not featured on the menu can order it anyway , and the chef will do his best to accommodate the request . They 've been assured that no one needs to carry a wad of dollar bills in his wallet because tipping is neither required nor expected . <p> All the stories are true . <p> " Expectations are high , " admits Mark Tamis , newly named resort manager who took his job sight unseen because he , too , had heard the tales . " My challenge is to keep up the quality and maintain the reputation . " <p> A staff of 702 helps him succeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the island they call home . Each prospective employee is interviewed five times , including a final session with general manager Mark Hellrung . " We look for the right attitude , " explains Hellrung . " We know we can teach them the skills . " Riding a tricycle is n't one of them , however . Hellrung tells of several cycling mishaps that occurred during the shakedown period just before the resort 's opening . The original plan was to use oversized tricycles to transport room-service orders from the central kitchen to the 196 guest rooms contained in " cottages " overlooking the ocean , golf course , and Mount Nevis . The idea had to be scrapped when the vehicles kept careening off curbs and bumping into bushes . It seems that most employees had never owned bicycles and had trouble maneuvering them . An executive decision was made , and the trikes were swapped for low-powered golf carts . <p> Although the Four Seasons is the island 's only full-service resort , visitors also have the option of staying in historic manor houses that once were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended in 1958 , but several cone-shaped stone mills stand in varying stages of dilapidation or renovation as reminders of bygone days . At the Golden Rock estate , built on the edge of a rain forest , the multilevel sugar mill boasts a massive four poster and is marketed as the honeymoon suite . At the 250-year-old Hermitage , guests are summoned to dinner at the great house by a two-bell alert , a throwback to plantation days . At the elegant Montpelier Inn , the low-key British owners assure patrons that children are always welcome , but see no need to mention that family guests have included Princess Diana and her boys . <p> Perhaps entertaining royalty is n't all that unusual . For such a tiny dot in the ocean , Nevis has played host to lofty visitors in the past , and the tradition continues in the present . Columbus and his crew dropped anchor long enough in 1493 to claim it for Spainand name it for the white mist that obscured the island 's central peak .

" They come in search of rejuvenation , and for that , there 's no place like Nevis . <p> A week is the perfect stay , says Four Seasons manager Hellrung , who urges first-time visitors to stick with the circuitous routing sometimes required to get to the island . The obscure location is a small price to pay for the pristine stretches of beaches and the refreshing lack of commercialism . Besides , as everyone knows , there are no shortcuts to Paradise .
