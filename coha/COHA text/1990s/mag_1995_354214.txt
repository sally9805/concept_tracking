I HAVE A PROBLEM . I 'M STUCK AT Level 6 . I 've been playing the computer game Doom II for , what , a week ? Two weeks ? Does time even matter anymore ? I 've blasted my way up to Level 6 , and I ca n't figure how to get out . Two dozen higher levels await me . I 've slaughtered " hell knights " and revenants and blubbery pink things that resemble bulls on tiptoe . I 've armed myself with shotguns , rocket launchers and plasma guns that can kill a zombie faster than you can say Hasta la vista , baby , but still wo n't get me out of Level 6 . <P> I have finally discovered the dubious joys of Doom . I sampled the original two years ago , of course , shortly after it spread across the Internet . But the truth is , Doom made me sick . Not the blood and guts of it  --  Doom is no gorier than , say , a Sam Peckinpah movie . What nauseated me was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twisting down narrow corridors . <P> My friend Audrey , a Doom aficionado , diagnosed my condition as dims . " Doom-induced motion sickness , " she explained . " Lots of people get it . At first . " <P> In the interest of participatory journalism , I swallowed my rising gorge and tried again . I wanted to understand why Doom , in the hands of an estimated 10 million players , may be the world 's most popular computer game . <P> So I overcame my DIMS . And immediately contracted an acute case of DAS  --  Doom addiction syndrome . In the space of a week , I was late for two meetings , canceled three lunches and spoke curtly to friends and family . Worse , my trigger finger has begun to itch when , in real life , I round the corner to the coffee machine . The demons , I fear , are everywhere . I plan to worry about that later , after I escape from Level 6 . <P> One appointment I did keep was with John Romero , co-founder of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which created Doom . I called him at 2 p.m. , as arranged , but he was n't there . I recognized the symptom . Later Romero explained how he handled appointments while living in Doomspace : " I try not to make any . " <P> I take comfort in the fact that we are not alone . So many people are Doomophiles that some firms have banned it from their networks . At AT &T's; Bell Labs , computer jocks quickly mastered all the levels , then created their own special challenges . If a Bell guy says , " Do Level 12 , Mahatma Gandhi  --  style , " he wants you to race through the level barehanded , without harming any monsters . <P> The other day I met a fellow known as " Wad Master " Steve Baldwin , who works right here at Time Inc. and specializes in creating wads ( Doomspeak for new levels ) . Steve has created an elaborate wad that looks exactly like the 37th floor of the Time &; Life Building . The Wad Master , like me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his desk drawn by a young daughter . But he has it all figured out . " Why watch Rambo when you can be Rambo ? " he asks . What I want to know is how to get out of Level 6 . I tell him where I 'm stuck , a place that looks like a fever-dream parking garage in which I 'm pinned down by a pair of lethal skeletons . The Wad Master nods thoughtfully , then gives me a closely guarded five-letter password that , when typed , will bring me every weapon and secret key . I will be a Doom god . In the elevator back to my office , my fingers twitch.
