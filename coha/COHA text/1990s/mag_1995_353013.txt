In Cape Town last week , motorcycle outriders escorted President Nelson Mandela to Parliament , where a red carpet ribboned down the granite steps . Leaving his limousine , Mandela was greeted by a navy honor guard in spotless whites . Air force jets flew overhead , and a 21-gun salute rang out from nearby Signal Hill . Beginning his second year in office , Mandela had arrived to open a new session of Parliament , and the spectacle suited the occasion  --  to all who remember apartheid , the very existence of a Mandela administration in South Africa is still amazing . <P> In his speech Mandela did not dwell on how far the country has come , however , but rather on how far it has to go . Corruption , crime , violence and strikes are threatening to get out of hand . The battle against the forces of anarchy and chaos , ' ' the President declared , has been joined . ' ' When it comes to rooting out corruption , ' ' he said , we will deal firmly and unequivocally with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be involved ' '  --  that 's just where one of Mandela 's problems lies . The person who has received the most attention recently , both for embarrassing the government and for possibly feathering her nest , is Mandela 's estranged wife Winnie . Two weeks ago in Johannesburg , at the funeral of a black police officer killed in a fight with white policemen , Winnie Mandela addressed the crowd of mourners . She accused the government of failing to eliminate racism from the workplace and of overindulgence in reconciliation ' ' with whites . Are we in power , ' ' she demanded , or just in the government ? ' ' <P> That was too much for the President . He ordered Winnie to retract her statement or resign her post as Deputy Minister of Arts and Culture . She submitted a letter that sought only to clarify ' ' her remarks . No , Mandela said , she would have to do better . Last week he accepted her second letter , in which she said she would like to apologize most sincerely for the impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' ' <P> Winnie Mandela has long been a problem for her husband and his colleagues in the African National Congress . During his 27 years in prison she was first a heroine of the antiapartheid movement and then an imperious rival to its leadership . The movement publicly condemned her in 1989 for inflicting a reign of terror ' ' on Soweto with her gang of bodyguards ; she was later convicted of kidnapping . She now could pose a political threat to the President . Voicing her angry populism , she provides leadership to thousands of young , militant township dwellers who are impatient with a deliberative political process and cooperation with South Africa 's whites . <P> Then there are Winnie 's dubious deals . After she announced that the A.N.C . Women 's League , which she heads , was going into a tourism venture with actor Omar Sharif , 11 of the league 's 25 executive-committee members resigned . Charging her with undemocratic behavior , ' ' they said she had defied the committee 's veto on the deal to form Road to Freedom Tours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used her official position to boost a new entertainment company run by her daughter Zinzi and also by reports of her association with a woman convicted of illegal diamond trading .
