<p> Free men ? Hardly . <p> But that 's the least of contradictions surrounding the anti-government extremists who this week traded their besieged farm for jail cells . <p> By surrendering to authorities whose authority they reject , the Freemen continued the pattern of lapsed logic and denied reality that marked their standoff with the FBI . <p> For 81 days , the world saw Justus Township only through distant camera lenses . Ominous images - an American Flag hung upside down , armed sentries on a barren hill - shimmered in heat waves off sun-warmed fields . <p> The view from inside the Freemen camp , however , was not that of a tight-knit terrorist cabal but of a ragged crew of hard-luck farmers and transient scam artists , some on the lam , most armed and all scared . <p> The Freemen started this siege wound tight , scornful of a government they thought had wronged them . Under the FBI 's unrelenting pressure , they passed the final days wound even tighter . <p> " It 's not a compound ! " Gloria Ward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compound . Ward was one of nine people who left before Thursday 's final exodus . <p> Use of the word " compound " on nightly news reports infuriated the Freemen . Criminals hide in compounds ; the Freemen were patriots , residing in the agrarian heart of America . <p> " It was a farm , " Ward said . " You want to know what life was like ? Go live on a farm . " <p> Indeed , there were ample signs of normal life , even as scores of federal agents stood guard just out of sight . <p> Ward 's daughters , 8-year-old Jaylynn and 10-year-old Courtnie , rode horses and fished in a pond near their rustic cabin . The adults kept busy with chores and sentry duty . One day they rolled out a tractor and disked an alfalfa field . <p> Some of the deer that wander the ranch ended up as dinner . Freemen have no use for hunting licenses , so the season was always open . <p> " We have more than adequate supplies and knowledge to remain on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freemen leader Russell Landers boasted May 23 in a cellular-phone call to a talk-radio show . <p> For two months , the FBI did little to burst the Freemen 's illusion of sovereignty . The agency , stung by criticism of how it lost control of sieges at Waco and Ruby Ridge , set up roadblocks miles away . Its agents and 45 third-party mediators endured days of Freemen rhetoric . <p> With references to the Constitution , common law and the Bible , the Freemen justified the actions of which they are accused : writing bogus checks for millions of dollars , setting up illegal courts and government , and threatening officials who might stand in their way . <p> When not talking , the Freemen studied law books and CD-ROMs , seeking support for their beliefs : The FBI is not a government agency , the only true American citizens are white men , blacks are subhuman , Jews are the offspring of Satan , U.S. currency is worthless . <p> " The nation 's in debt to me right now , " Freemen leader Rodney Skurdal said on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the largest bankers in the nation right now , based on law , and I can take it right back into biblical law . ... God said we throw the gold and silver into the streets , right ? So what 's left ? That 's credit . It 's all civilly correct and constitutionally correct . " <p> In this windswept corner of the West , where hard work and common sense are daily bread , such talk was considered nonsense . <p> At Justus Township , it was seen as divinely inspired wisdom . <p> Freeman Ralph Clark , 65 , a local farmer with little schooling and a mountain of debt , told neighbors that Skurdal , who showed up in the area two years ago , was the smartest man he 'd ever met . <p> It was the support of Clark and his family , whose foreclosed farm comprised the core of Justus Township , that gave outside agitators like Skurdal and Landers a solid base to prolong the standoff . <p> The six Clarks - mostly short and stocky , their round faces bearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - were eager students in the Freemen school of conspiracy theories and easy financial fixes . <p> " I 've always said Ralph was as addicted to a new idea as some people are to drugs and alcohol , " said neighboring rancher Kenneth Coulter . Ralph Clark had sheared sheep , speculated in real estate , hauled dirt and built cabins for hunters - but never stayed at one thing long enough to make money , Coulter said . <p> Ralph 's wife , Kay , was the quiet follower . Rosie , wife of Ralph 's brother , Emmett , is described by neighbors as a woman who could take a rumor and run with it to the point of panic . <p> Edwin , 45 , Ralph 's son , had a reputation as capable and level-headed but nonetheless shared the family distaste for authority . His son , Casey , 21 , followed suit . <p> Emmett , 67 , was the stalwart , and it hit the family hard when he , too , lost his farm to the bank in 1994 . <p> Amid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group - pilgrims who attended seminars at the farm and then stayed to escape their own legal troubles . <p> Then , on May 21 , the stalemate broke . Charles Duke , a Colorado legislator invited by the Freemen to mediate because of his ties to the far-right patriot movement , exploded in anger after six days at the farm . The cameras caught him shouting and waving his arms at Skurdal . <p> Duke stormed off , and the alarmed Freemen dispatched patrols around the property . A sputtering Duke told reporters the Freemen " need to feel some pain . " <p> The FBI turned up the pressure - bringing in armored vehicles , swooping over the farm in a military-style helicopter and cutting off power . <p> Freemen smokers ran out of cigarettes . Fresh food was running low . Emmett Clark , who suffers prostate problems , was reportedly passing bloody urine . Ralph Clark needed medication , as did young Casey , who 'd had a tumor removed from his pituitary gland a few years back . <p> When meeting with negotiators , the Freemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FBI perimeter except for comments about " the guys out there . " <p> But their increasing tension showed . When news cameras were moved off a nearby hill , the Freemen - who 'd earlier threatened reporters with bodily harm and stolen a TV crew 's equipment - suddenly championed the press , urging reporters to stay . <p> By June 6 , when Gloria Ward 's sister Lynn Neilsen persuaded Ward to walk out with her daughters and common-law husband , Elwin , the mood was nasty . <p> " It was as close to hell as I ever want to get , " Neilsen said . Freemen called her " a whore of Babylon " and insisted the Bible says girls should marry as soon as they start to menstruate , she said . <p> The reality of their predicament finally sank in early this week . After months of bluster , their surrender Thursday evening was quiet . As a low western sun bathed the farm in a warm glow , the Freemen exchanged hugs , offered prayers to Yahweh and stepped into FBI vans . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day was down , the FBI checkpoint where stern-faced agents had stopped all comers was empty , and pickup trucks were barreling down the dirt road , raising long plumes of dust . <p> EDITOR 'S NOTE - David Foster is the AP 's Northwest regional reporter , based in Seattle .
