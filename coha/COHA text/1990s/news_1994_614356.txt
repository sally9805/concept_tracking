<p> Maybe all those pictures of the Holy Father are wrong . It 's an idea that makes traditional believers furious . <p> " So God created humankind in his image , in the image of God he created them ; male and female he created them . " Genesis 1:27 ( New Revised Standard Version ) <p> Rain fell in sheets against the shiny black windows of a meeting room at Emory University 's Cannon Chapel . Inside , 30 people gathered around a low table that held a dozen candles . <p> In the flickering candlelight , members of the group - mostly women - had drawn their " feelings " in the shapes of flowers and flowing lines with colored chalk on large sheets of paper . They had circle-danced . They had tried to discover their " soul voices . " <p> Now , they were ready for the finale . <p> They threw back their heads and howled at the moon - like cats , like coyotes , like hurt dogs . <p> " We howl holiness , " their leader said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few nights before Easter was part of a week of seminars , conferences and more conventional worship services focusing on women and religion . <p> Two nights later in a Buckhead synagogue , 40 Jewish women held a Passover seder to celebrate the escape of the Israelites from Egyptian slavery . To the liturgy of plagues inflicted by God upon the Egyptians , they added their own modern-day " plagues " - " the consistently male image of God , " " the sexist language of most prayers and blessings , " " the prison created by the rigid traditional views of men and women . " <p> Across Judaism , Catholicism and mainline Protestantism , women are stretching beyond tradition to worship in new ways . They call their search " thealogy , " using the feminine form of the Greek root-word for God . <p> Those with traditional views call it heresy , or worse , a complete abandonment of historic faith . <p> Each side accuses the other of idolatry . Traditionalists charge that radical women are a tiny fringe who have created a false goddess to replace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have focused so exclusively on a masculine image of the deity that the male metaphor itself is worshiped . <p> " The issue is not to be taken lightly , " says Jacquelyn Grant , professor of systematic theology at Atlanta 's Interdenominational Theological Center . " I would argue that the way we understand the divine and the way we speak about the divine has a lot to do with the way we structure our church and our society . <p> " The fact that we historically conceived of God as a male is not incidental but is a part of the very nature of patriarchal thinking . The whole move to uncover the feminine face of God . . . is an attempt to empower women . It 's a very empowering process when we can begin to see ourselves in the image of God . " <p> Talk of a ' New Reformation ' <p> Leading voices in the religious feminist movement talk of a " new Reformation , " sometimes quoting John Calvin , who opened his " Institutes " with the assertion , " Without knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Without knowledge of God there is no knowledge of self . " <p> Women must know a female deity for true self-understanding , according to Carroll Saussy , professor of pastoral theology at Wesley Theological Seminary in Washington . " Without knowledge of self there is no knowledge of Goddess . . . . without knowledge of Goddess there is no knowledge of self , " she writes in her book " God Images and Self Esteem . " <p> Helen Hull Hitchcock of Women for Faith and Family , a Roman Catholic traditionalist organization , takes a diametrically opposite view . Radical feminism , she says , is " one of the most devastating religious epidemics of our , or any other time - an infectious and communicable disease of the human spirit for which there is no easy cure , and which afflicts . . . our children , the future of the human race and the future of the church . " <p> The dispute about the gender of God recently came to the forefront among many mainline Protestants amid controversy over a women 's conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rituals in the name of Sophia , the biblical figure of wisdom . <p> But the movement is not new . A century ago , suffragette Elizabeth Cady Stanton wrote a feminist exegesis called " The Women 's Bible . " Even the modern wave of religious feminism is more than 20 years old , arising as part of an overall awakening of interest in women 's causes in the United States and Europe . <p> At first , religious feminists ' demands were clear : recognition as full members in the church , appointment to offices , ordination to the ministry and promotion into the episcopal hierarchy . <p> Their consciousness raised , some denominations rewrote their hymnals . " Good Christian Men Rejoice " became " Good Christian Friends Rejoice . " " God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen " was dropped from some songbooks . <p> Ministers took care to refer to " brothers and sisters , " Sunday school literature showed pictures of men doing laundry and women with briefcases , and newer Bible translations talked about the " children of Israel , " and " humankind " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mankind . " <p> Through it all , though , names for God remained male . <p> " Eventually , feminists in established religions took on the Big Man himself , the God who was described and invoked in almost exclusively male terms , " writes Cynthia Eller , adjunct professor at Fairleigh Dickinson University , in her book " Living in the Lap of the Goddess . " <p> Attention to feminine traits <p> Some demands for change are largely a matter of degree . <p> Many women and their male supporters simply want more attention to the feminine traits of God - a request they maintain is soundly grounded in scripture . God is compared in the Bible to a hen protecting her chicks ( Luke 13:34 ) , a bear robbed of her cubs ( Hosea 13:8 ) , a mother comforting her child ( Isaiah 66:13 ) and a woman searching for a lost coin ( Luke 15:8- 10 ) . <p> Those who prefer a more radical solution complain that simply to recognize nurturing aspects was to portray God as a divine Alan Alda , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God in feminine terms . Even Pope John Paul I seemed willing to go this far , saying in a 1978 speech , " God is a Father . More than that , God is a Mother . " <p> Still other feminists want to go further - to talk about a separate , female persona of God . A few laid claim to the Holy Spirit , the third part of the Christian trinity , as the feminine deity . A few focused on the Virgin Mary . Sophia provided a handy name for others to invoke . Sophia appears as the female personification of wisdom in Proverbs , Job and some books of what Catholics know as the Deuterocanon and Protestants call the Apocrypha . <p> Catholic theologian Elizabeth Johnson advocates full recognition of Sophia to " redeem " Christ from patriarchy . She describes Jesus as " the prophet and child of Sophia " and an " envoy of Sophia " who " walks her paths of justice and peace and invites others to do likewise . " <p> Johnson , author of the 1993 book " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sophia-God " and " Jesus-Sophia . " <p> A controversial liturgy at the Minneapolis Re-Imagining Conference last November addressed Sophia this way : " Our maker Sophia , we are women in your image ; with the hot blood of our wombs we give form to new life . . . with the nectar between our thighs we invite a lover . . . with our warm body fluids we remind the world of its pleasures and sensations . " <p> Here , many Christians see flashing " Danger " signals . Here , they assert , participants have moved from worshiping God in new ways to worshiping a new god - or goddess . <p> " I hope we are constantly speaking in new and fresh ways about God , " says Elizabeth Actemeier , a professor at Union Theological Seminary in Richmond , Va . " But whenever the language we use contradicts what God has revealed , then we 're on the wrong track . " <p> At the Re-Imagining conference , she said , " they took the figure of Sophia , a perfectly legitimate figure in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure . She simply is not . In no way is she a manifestation of the Godhead . " <p> Actemeier , an ordained minister in the Presbyterian Church ( U.S.A. ) draws a distinction between " feminism " and " radical feminism . " Feminism , she says , addresses legitimate concerns about oppression of women who , she says , " have been allowed to serve millions of church suppers , teach Sunday school and support the mission program of the church , but they have not been allowed leadership roles in the Body of Christ . " <p> Some women have reacted with justifiable rage , she said . But the rage has sometimes been directed at remaking instead of merely reshaping the church . " What they 're really doing is constructing a new church , a new religion , " she said . " It 's an entirely different religion than the Christian faith . " <p> Donna Steichen , the Catholic laywoman who wrote " Ungodly Rage , " an attack on Catholic feminism , provides a more graphic image : Feminists are attempting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who destroy the eggs and young of other birds in order to inhabit nests they did not build . " <p> Actemeier , Steichen and other critics charge radical religious feminists with basing their theology entirely on their own experience , creating a goddess in their image . This , they say , is a self-centered approach that goes against historic Christian doctrine . <p> " The gospel of Jesus Christ does not call us to self-actualization , " says Faye Short of Commerce , Ga. , director of a national United Methodist evangelical women 's group . " It calls us to self-denial . " <p> Feminists counter that the leaders of the church have always based their understanding of God on experience - but that experience has been exclusively male . <p> " The Christian religion shows we always use the dimensions of our experience to talk about God , " says Rebecca Chopp , a United Methodist minister and associate professor of systematic theology at Emory 's Candler School of Theology . " The issue is . . . that we need to ask ourselves what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , a just God ? " <p> Examine tradition , experience <p> Many Christians seem uncomfortable with extreme viewpoints on both sides . Both feminists and traditionalists agree that God is above gender , race and other human traits . Centrists hope that the church can be open to fresh expressions of God but stay on the solid ground of doctrine . <p> Relying exclusively on either tradition or experience limits God , says Catherine Gonzales , professor of church history at Columbia Theological Seminary , a Presbyterian Church ( U.S.A. ) institution in Decatur . <p> " Simply to stress external authority - that is scripture and tradition - leads to a kind of dead orthodoxy , " she said . " It also has a tendency to equate faith with acceptance of doctrine . " <p> But to base theology only on one 's experience is to " set the individual up as a universe all by himself , both as creature and creator , " she said . <p> Gonzales said she hopes for a new appreciation of both tradition and personal experience of the divine - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time in coming . " That 's going to take some revival in the church , and I do n't think that is happening at the moment , " she said . " I think all the fighting simply delays it . "
