<p> In Maryland , state-wide growth management and planning initiatives , introduced unsuccessfully in the legislature last year , are hardly being discussed in the State House in Annapolis this year . Understandably they have taken a back seat to the exigencies and debate arising from the state 's fiscal crisis . <p> Fortunately , however , the state-wide budget crunch has n't deterred some counties from moving ahead with new thinking about their own growth management and land-use planning strategies . <p> Calvert County , occupying the long peninsula between the Patuxent River and the Chesapeake Bay south of Anne Arundel County , is a case in point . <p> Still predominantly rural and sparsely populated , Calvert County is 1 1/2 hours from the District . Most residents of the national capital region have never been there , although Solomons , at the county 's southern tip , increasingly rivals Annapolis as a regional , recreational boating center . <p> Maryland Route 4 , a divided four-lane arterial highway , runs spine-like down the peninsula 's full length and acts as the county 's high velocity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frederick , the county seat , and provides access via small country roads to other , sometimes charming small towns up and down the peninsula  --  Chesapeake Beach , Lower Marlboro , Huntingtown , Scientists Cliffs . <p> The county is home to a nuclear power plant at Calvert Cliffs , is the site of a unique cypress swamp and dozens of intimate , tree-lined creeks feeding into the Patuxent River , and contains many thousands of acres of farmland and forest . Some of Maryland 's most picturesque tobacco barns continue to stand resolutely in Calvert County . <p> Thanks primarily to energy , and tax revenues , generated by Baltimore Gas &; Electric Co. ' s Calvert Cliffs power plant , the county has been able to maintain its fiscal health . <p> But things are changing . Home builders and buyers have discovered the rural charm  --  and real estate bargains  --  available in Calvert County . Thus , in recent years , the county 's growth rate has outpaced that of almost every other Maryland jurisdiction . This growth is attributable to in-migration of both suburban commuters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escapists seeking a bucolic lifestyle and setting in which to retreat or retire . <p> Consequently traffic , plus the need for road improvements , is increasing , along with further demand for converting farmland to residential land . Conversion pressures are reinforced by the diminishing profitability of agriculture . And , naturally , public service needs and costs are outstripping tax revenues . Not surprisingly , county residents have awakened to a simple reality : their pastoral environment and their county 's balanced budget are threatened . <p> In an effort to reconsider county land-use policies , county planners organized an all-day symposium a few weeks ago focusing on two questions of vital concern to county citizens . What should the county look like 20 years hence ? Is there consensus on a future vision ? And if there is consensus , what methods are available and applicable today to achieve this vision ? <p> The meeting was attended by dozens of concerned citizens , county government officials and leaders of civic and business organizations . A group of faculty and graduate students from the University of Maryland School of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon workshop sessions . Morning discussions focused on defining the " vision " ; afternoon discussions focused on vision implementation mechanisms  --  regulatory , technical , financial . <p> From the outset , an overriding concern seemed to be the long-range impact of large lot subdivision development . <p> Under existing zoning , much of the county 's remaining agricultural land can be carved up into mini-estates  --  lots ranging from one to five acres in size  --  served by private wells and septic systems . Requiring no public sewer and water facilities , mini-estate development could persist as the land-use pattern of least resistance . <p> Unchecked , this trend ultimately promises to yield what many perceive to be an undesirable vision : a county dominated by acre upon acre of treeless subdivision tracts dotted with pseudo-country houses spaced a few hundred feet apart , their manicured lawns demanding continual fertilizing and mowing . <p> Workshop participants recognized that this pattern of development , propagating throughout the county , will essentially destroy the authentically rural character of the landscape . Indeed , many at the symposium recognized that such subdivisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rural image . Rather , they understood mini-estate development to be just another , looser form of land gobbling , a kind of suburban sprawl that offers the benefits of neither urban nor country life . <p> Accordingly , those at the symposium envisioned the county 's future negatively unless growth policies change in ways that protect the existing rural landscape . Yet they are not opposed to growth , since their livelihoods and economic survival depend on sustainable development and employment opportunities . <p> Thus they would like to reinforce incentives and adopt regulations offering the best of both worlds : preservation of an agrarian landscape and lifestyle , on the one hand , and growth and urbanization , when and where appropriate , on the other . <p> Methods for achieving this , some already embodied in previously adopted master plan goals , were discussed extensively : <p> Concentrate residential growth at higher densities  --  several dwellings per acre  --  in designated town centers and rural villages , where adequate roads and utilities exist or can be provided . Development should occur only on land intrinsically suitable for building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wildlife areas undisturbed . <p> Require that new , low-density residential development be clustered . Instead of subdividing tracts into large lots , each containing several acres , houses would sit on much smaller lots , as little as a few thousand square feet each . Yet overall tract density would remain constant . Consequently most of the tract would remain as natural or recreational open space , while the clustered houses would form an efficiently serviced , more physically and socially coherent hamlet within the tract . <p> Plan and permanently maintain county-wide , contiguous open space networks  --  parks , trail systems , greenways , view sheds  --  for recreational and scenic purposes . With appropriate land-use legislation delineating growth areas , plus mandatory clustering , the county could acquire its open space network through voluntary dedication rather than costly land purchases or condemnation . <p> Facilitate the use of transferable development rights ( TDR ) , which shifts residential development permanently from open space and agricultural areas  --  " sending " zones slated for preservation  --  to designated town centers and rural villages  --  " receiving " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landowner to sell development and density rights attributable to his property under existing zoning laws . Developers purchase such rights and transfer them to properties earmarked for increased density . Thus the TDR seller realizes some of the developed value of his land without its ever being developed . TDR in effect down zones property without being confiscatory and ensures some measure of economic equity . <p> Calvert County still has much work to do to follow up on last month 's symposium . Additional county-wide planning , but in more detail , must be undertaken to designate specific lands for growth and preservation . Further public education and consensus building will be needed . New legislation , including new zoning overlays , must be drafted and publicly considered . But at least serious consideration has begun , and on a positive note . Roger K.
