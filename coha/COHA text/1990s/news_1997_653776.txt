<p> In his glass-sheathed board room overlooking a velvety green golf course here , Vanus Taepaisitphongse seems becalmed in the eye of the storm . In reality , he is hanging on to a life raft by his fingertips . <p> " We 're just trying to survive , " said Mr. Vanus , the 38-year-old president of the Betagro Group , until this year a fast-growing agribusiness . But when the Thai currency , the baht , went into free fall in July , just about everything that could go wrong for Mr. Vanus and Betagro has gone wrong . <p> After years of preparation , Betagro 's plans to be listed on the Bangkok stock market were scuttled . Several foreign joint ventures have been abandoned . Business is sharply slumping as some customers fail to pay their bills . Raw materials bought abroad are suddenly much more expensive . And space in the company 's gleaming new headquarters is going begging . <p> " The worst thing is there is no liquidity , " said Mr. Vanus , who expects as much as a 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million in 1996 . " The banks do not give new money at all . " <p> Across the nations of Southeast Asia  --  until recently ballyhooed as the second generation of economic tigers , soon to catch up with Hong Kong , Taiwan , South Korea and Singapore  --  things are going very wrong , and Thailand is leading the way . <p> " Basically it 's a financial problem across the region , " said Nicholas Kwan , chief regional economist for Merrill Lynch Asia Pacific in Hong Kong . But Thailand , he said , " is a much broader problem : It 's not just economically weak , but it 's weak socially and politically . " <p> " In other countries  --  the Philippines , Indonesia , Malaysia  --  things are confined to the financial sector and the stock markets , " he said . <p> These countries " may be able to delink themselves from Thailand , " he continued . " Otherwise , things will get more ugly . " <p> The ugliness began in Thailand with years of unrestrained lending on speculative real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worries growing over mounting unpaid loans , investors , local and foreign , started fleeing Thai stocks and the baht . Finally , with the country 's foreign-exchange reserves plummeting , Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh 's Government freed the baht from a dollar-linked trading band early in July , sending its value into a downward spiral that jolted Asian foreign-exchange and stock markets . <p> Far from over , Thailand 's troubles  --  like the typhoons that scour the region this time of year  --  have left mounds of wreckage in their wake . <p> The banks are not lending , bills are going unpaid , interest rates are sky- high for those who can manage to borrow , bankruptcies are spreading for those who ca n't . Since July , the baht has lost 30 percent of its value against the dollar , sending the cost of imported materials soaring . The real estate market has collapsed . Unemployment is climbing . <p> The Prime Minister is battling for his political life and Thais are nervous about the appearance of tanks and troops in the streets of Bangkok . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were simply a part of promotion ceremonies for several generals . <p> Even a $17.2 billion rescue package led by the International Monetary Fund , accompanied by stringent demands for financial discipline , has not done much to increase confidence : early this month , the national chamber of commerce urged the Prime Minister to resign . <p> It is possible that the overall economy may not grow at all in 1997 , or even next year , a startling turnabout after a decade 's expansion that averaged roughly 9 percent a year . <p> A vivid reminder of the paralysis is no farther away than Bangkok 's skyline . A forest of construction cranes has thinned out , and many of those left seem frozen in midswing over silent building sites . A $1 billion elevated light-rail project that was being built as part of a regional commuter rail system by the Hong Kong entrepreneur Gordon Wu now stands idle , ranks of naked concrete pillars parading half-finished down the side of a highway . <p> " This is far worse than Mexico , " said Rui Gomes Belo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in private business here , referring to the peso crisis that swept through the Mexican economy in 1994-95 . " What the Government says and what is done is n't the same thing . They say they 're going to support export industries . But you go to the Export-Import Bank for assistance and there 's nothing . This is a political problem and until the political problem is resolved , nothing will happen . " <p> In the meantime , Bangkok 's businesses are desperately trying to stay afloat . Just beyond Lumpini Park , a verdant space of trees and meandering paths , Vorawat Vetpirayakom runs Alpha Media , a graphics reproduction and electronic publishing business based in a scuffed and aging three-story building . <p> Like the operators of many small companies here  --  Alpha has 15 employees and sales of about $500,000 a year  --  Mr. Vorawat is grappling with rising costs and falling revenue , and no clear idea of how to keep things running . <p> If his computers or complicated plate-making machines die , he said , there would be enormous difficulty finding credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connections inside a bank , you can get a loan , " he said . " If you do n't , even if you have good assets , you ca n't get a loan . And if you do get a loan somehow , the interest rates are very , very high . " <p> " Our real problem right now is our clients are delaying payments , " he continued . " We had 30-day-to-60-day billing . Now it has become 90 days , or 120 . " <p> Foreign investors also feel alarmed . Mr. Gomes Belo , the former World Bank official , is a director and executive vice president of the Hantex Company , which manufactures nylon yarns . Like many of his colleagues , he said he was deeply worried not just about his own business but the Thai economy as a whole . <p> " We have very serious problems , " he said . " Business needs to have access to finance , and there is none . All companies are suffering from that . Lines of credit are being squeezed . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lending for cars , mortgages and corporate needs , the Government has shut down 58 in the last 60 days for being insolvent . Things are not much better at the 15 Thai commercial banks . In a gloomy report issued earlier this month , Moody 's Investors Service said that the " asset quality at Thai banks is generally poor and likely to worsen as repercussions from the asset bubble affect real estate loans . " <p> " Some banks , " Moody 's concluded , " currently have , or will have , solvency problems . " <p> Most businesses in Thailand , Mr. Gomes Belo said , " are value-added ; we import raw material , add labor and low technology , and export . " <p> " When lines of credit decrease 30 percent , " he said , " you have less access to money and you ca n't import the raw materials you need . " <p> There are other problems with imports these days . " All the petroleum is imported into this country , " said Bryan J. Baldwin , an adviser to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And all petroleum products are price regulated . " <p> With price rises limited to no more than 8 percent , Loxley was bound to lose money on Castrol , said Mr. Baldwin , who has been in Thailand for 20 years . " But you have to continue your business , to maintain market share , " he said . " You accept what the Ministry of Commerce allows in terms of price increases , and then you apply for a new one . " <p> Things will not change until the political situation is sorted out , Mr. Baldwin said . " If the political situation is stabilized , you could see some calming in three , four , six months , " he said . " But it will take until 2002 until things are on an upgrade . " <p> At Betagro , which operates businesses from raising chickens and pigs to producing veterinary drugs to making processed food , Mr. Vanus is worried less about the political climate than about the future of his company . <p> " At first I did not worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the situation got worse and worse . " <p> " When the banks squeeze the credit line , " he added , " we use exports to finance operations . But when the baht devalues further , that puts us in worse shape . " <p> Now , he said , he is simply trying to steer the company through the storm . " We are , of course , thinking about head count or cutting salaries , " he went on . Plans to build a sausage factory have been put aside . " Two months ago , we wanted to open in Vietnam . But I think we will stop that . " A separate investment in China , in a small feed mill , is going disastrously . " We got burned , " he said . <p> All this contributed to the derailing of the company 's plans to be listed on the stock exchange . " We got permission to list two months ago , " Mr. Vanus said . " But we withdrew the application . " <p> Under the exchange 's rules , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history Betagro will not have this year . " It will take three years at least , " Mr. Vanus said , to begin the process again . <p> His eyes wandered to the golf course spread beneath his window . " Thank God I do n't have that , " he said . " They 're really losing money . " <p> Not everyone , however , is distressed at the mounting economic chaos . Indeed , for Songkar Rattanapan , business has never been better . <p> A car repossessor and loan collector for a finance company , the 30-year-old Mr. Songkar scarcely has time to eat . " I used to do this for one finance company , " he said , laughing , " but they closed down . Now I 'm working for another one . They need people like me . " <p> " I go looking for people who do n't pay back their loans , " he said , sitting outside an alleyway storefront where he and his team plot their moves . " And I take back cars from people who ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased by 40 percent . " <p> But most businesspeople , not being scavengers , do not share Mr. Songkar 's cheery appraisal of the situation . <p> " I wake up and start pointing my finger at the Prime Minister , " Mr. Vanus said . " The players , the politicians , understand what is going on . They just do not have the moral understanding to change . <p> " My father says , ' You just do anything to survive for the next three years . ' We will try .
