Environmental Protection Agency chief CAROL BROWNER is in for an angry letter from some Congressmen this week . At issue : " serious , perhaps even illegal " behavior on the part of EPA senior scientist ALAN RUBIN , author of the 503 Sludge Rule , which declared municipal wastes safe for spreading in forests and farmlands . <P> What Representative JOE KNOLLENBERG ( R. , Mich . ) , House science committee chair JAMES SENSENBRENNER ( R. , Wis . ) , Senator JAMES INHOFE ( R. , Okla. ) and others want to know is , Has Rubin been engaging in " threatening and harassing " telephone calls and e-mails to the residences of anti-sludge activists Helaine Shields , Jane Beswick and others ? Did Rubin attempt to bribe a waste- treatment-company executive to get him to " refrain from raising concerns " about sludge transportation and stop insisting it be transported as hazardous waste ? Has Rubin been distributing " selected , preliminary " risk data that appeared to discredit sludge-toxicity findings by EPA scientist David Lewis ? The agency has come under fire for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have spread . " I must be on to something , or he would n't be coming at me like this , " says California dairy farmer and anti-sludger Beswick , who got eight letters from Rubin , one accompanied by a note : " Jane : Ask not for whom the bell tolls ; it tolls for thee ! " <P> Rubin , contacted by TIME , denied all charges . He says he regularly sends communications to those who oppose EPA policy , not to harass or threaten but to inform . <P>  --  By Arnold Mann/Washington
