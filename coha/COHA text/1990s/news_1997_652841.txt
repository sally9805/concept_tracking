<p> To the 4-year-old boy , the Brooklyn Museum was a house of magic , a seemingly endless trove of huge and beautiful pictures , wondrously recreated period rooms and stunning art objects culled from civilizations from Mesopotamia to Mexico . <p> Arnold L. Lehman , a child living in the Marine Park section of Brooklyn , visited the museum regularly with an uncle who loved art and the way it made the boy 's eyes sparkle . It was his first museum , and he continued to visit even after his family joined the migration to Long Island in the mid-1950 's . <p> Mr. Lehman , now 52 , remembers being lifted up by his uncle to see his old friends the mummies , and staring down through the millennia to a world indescribably different . " I would always want to go back and see the Egyptian galleries , over and over and over , " he said during a recent tour of the museum . <p> These days , many of the coffins and mummies are displayed upright , easier for a child to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lehman , who is returning to the Brooklyn Museum of Art on Sept. 1 as its new director , can visit them whenever he chooses . His habit at the Baltimore Museum of Art , where he has been director for 18 years , has been to prowl the halls at least once a day : picking up a gum wrapper here , straining to overhear visitors ' comments there . <p> " The galleries are where the action is , " Mr. Lehman said . " That 's where I can feel how the museum is working . " <p> On one of his visits to Brooklyn , he eavesdropped on a group of young visitors engaged in avid discussion about why so many of the ancient Egyptian figures lack noses . " I started to laugh out loud , " he said . Not because of their ignorance , but because this exact question had nagged him , too , as a youth . The answer : thousands of years of wear and tear can do this to the hardiest of images . <p> Before taking his new post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own , anonymously wandering what is said to be the seventh largest collection of art in North America . He liked the diversity of the crowd , he said , and found that even as a sophisticated professional he was as much in awe of the place as he had been as child . <p> He is quick to say it would be " stupid " to think he had accepted the position merely because of fond childhood memories . Part of the attraction is the professional opportunity to build on his Baltimore success of making a fine arts museum more relevant to more people , particularly to members of minorities and others traditionally excluded from the world of fine arts . In Baltimore , " we fight for every single person to come to our museum , " he declared . " We do n't let anyone go without a fight . " <p> Brooklyn promises to be another bare-knuckle fight , and Mr. Lehman 's hopes are enormous . He wants to see annual attendance , 265,000 last year , return to more than a million , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing new for the Brooklyn Museum . It was designed by McKim , Mead &; White to be by far the world 's largest , the crown jewel of what was then the independent city of Brooklyn . But at the stroke of midnight on Dec. 31 , 1897 , just months after the first section of the museum opened , the city of Brooklyn ceased to exist as a political entity . Only one of four wings was ever finished . <p> Ever since , the Brooklyn Museum has been perceived , all too correctly , to be playing catch-up to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in terms of attendance , endowment and civic support . This , despite having collections of Egyptian , American , primitive and decorative arts that are intensely admired around the world . <p> Robert T. Buck , who was the Brooklyn Museum 's director for 13 years , until he resigned in July , said : " It 's always been this kind of second-citizen problem . You 're always totally in competition with the magic mountain of Manhattan . " Plans for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new strategy : forget about Manhattan . The chairman , Robert S. Rubin , said the museum would now direct its energies toward making it all that it can be for the 2.3 million people in Brooklyn . <p> Down the line , Mr. Lehman said , such a strategy will help attract Manhattan visitors , too . Beginning next month , for example , the museum will stay open on Saturday evenings , hoping to attract visitors with a wine bar , showings of silent film classics and a dance band . In this age of marketing , it is not enough simply to have great stuff . <p> " It 's the riches that create the problem , " said Dr. Peter C. Marzio , director of the Houston Museum of Fine Arts . " The permanent collection is obviously so good , they sit around wringing their hands and saying , ' The permanent collection is so good , why does n't everyone come to see our permanent collection ? ' " <p> Mr. Lehman also promises to cooperate with museums like Houston 's , helping to finance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's huge collection readily available to those curators . Another fan , J. Carter Brown , the former director of the National Gallery in Washington , said , " Arnold 's track record in Baltimore is nothing short of spectacular . " <p> Mr. Buck came in with similar accolades . And he leaves with accomplishments , including increasing the Brooklyn Museum 's endowment to $40 million from $12 million , and establishing its first two endowed chairs , one for a curator of American painting and sculpture , held by Linda S. Ferber , who has also served as acting director since July . The other chair is in the arts of the Americas and has not yet been filled . <p> Mr. Buck also leaves a legacy of big shows , including " Matisse and the Mediterranean , " which is to open in October . <p> If the museum 's new focus is squarely on Brooklyn and its many diverse communities , Mr. Lehman seems a logical choice . Before he turned to the arts full time , he worked on urban planning issues in all five boroughs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been on outreach and education , though he also built up the collection . In Brooklyn , where the collection is more than 10 times larger , proper storage is a higher priority than acquisition . <p> Even Caribbean Day Has a Place , He Says <p> Mr. Lehman , who at first turned down the Brooklyn job , was pursued because of his skill at combining community and artistic concerns , Mr. Rubin said . He emphasized that Mr. Lehman 's fund-raising skills  --  he increased Baltimore 's endowment to $40 million from $1 million  --  was not the primary reason . <p> " The endowment is first and foremost the responsibility of the board , " Mr. Rubin said . " If we put on a series of lousy exhibitions , that 's his responsibility . " <p> In conversation , Mr. Lehman can come across as dry , using coolly analytical language , but he also has a quirky sense of humor . Lately he has been joking , or at least people think he is joking , that he may open the museum to the Caribbean Day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could instantly increase attendance by a million in one day , " he said . <p> Mr. Lehman admits he is hard to define , pointing out that he has worked as an urban planner , a university professor and a curator . After graduating from Johns Hopkins University , he applied to doctoral programs in anthropology , English and art history . His academic direction would be determined by who accepted him . Art history won . After completing his doctorate at Yale in the late 1960 's , he taught at City College and other institutions in New York . He considered museum work but rejected it as " too sedentary . " <p> Later he worked for the Fund for the City of New York and the Parks Council to channel Ford Foundation money toward urban problems . In 1971 , he became executive director of the Parks Council , an advocacy group ; one of his fights was with the Metropolitan Museum over its expansion into Central Park . <p> In 1974 he became director of the new Miami Art Center , and over five years led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and four suburban satellites . When he became director of the Baltimore Museum of Art , Mr. Lehman arrived to find a museum with almost no endowment , a tiny operating budget and a dysfunctional building . He began by asking a question : " What makes a museum friendly to people who do n't know it ? " <p> His answer was to begin with the front door , redesigning the entrance to make it more accessible . In addition to adding shops and cafes directly inside , he erected a new sculpture garden that draws visitors who have never entered the rest of the museum . <p> In Brooklyn , the front entrance is also one of the first questions Mr. Lehman will address . A study is under way on restoring the Grand Staircase that graced the front of the original building . It was removed in 1934 , in part because of populist sentiment that it was wrong to ask people to rise to the level of art . Though Mr. Lehman is undecided about the restoration , he believes that monumental structures can as easily exalt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he recalls a recent conversation in Baltimore with young museum visitors , many of them black , about that museum 's seemingly imposing Neo-Classical architecture . " A whole bunch of teen-agers said to me that ' the building makes me feel safe and I do n't feel safe on the street , ' " he said . " They like the idea the building feels like it 's going to be there always . " <p> A quarter to a third of the Brooklyn museum 's visitors are members of minority groups , Mr. Lehman noted . " Every museum in the country has been trying to increase diversity , and Brooklyn has , " he said . " More important , how do you get them to feel affiliated ? " Hoping Friends Will Cross the Bridge <p> John J. Oliver , publisher of The Afro-American , a newspaper in Baltimore , said Mr. Lehman knew enough to listen . " He understood he did n't know what was going to be most important to black folks , so he had the good sense to provide forums and resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was looking for a place in Brooklyn to park himself and his wife , Pamela , who works in a literacy program in Baltimore . Though their two sons , Nick , 26 and Zachary , 24 , no longer live at home , the Lehmans need a lot of space for the large modern art objects he collects . <p> " I plan to do a lot of entertaining , " Mr. Lehman said . " And I want people from Manhattan to get used to coming across the bridge . " <p> Mr. Lehman also wants to make full use of the multiplier effect of Brooklyn 's cultural institutions : the Botanic Garden ; the Public Library , the Children 's Museum and the delightful child-size zoo in Prospect Park . <p> " Everybody talks about Museum Mile in Manhattan , " Mr. Lehman said . " But as a cultural corridor , I do n't think this neighborhood should give up first place to anyone .
