From the comet-ravaged cloudtops of Jupiter to the dynamic atmospheres of Uranus and Neptune , astronomer Heidi Hammel shows that the outer planets hold surprises . by Ruth Flanagan // ON JULY 15 , 1994 , MIT RESEARCH SCIENTIST Heidi Hammel looked up at a computer screen at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore , and her heart dropped to the floor . What she saw was a nightmare come true : an image of Jupiter so overexposed that its features were almost entirely lost . Many months before , the 34-year-old astronomer had been given a singular honor : She was to lead the scientific team recording the collision of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter 's atmosphere using the Hubble Space Telescope at visi- ble wavelengths . It was n't a stress-free assignment . Since human beings had never recorded such a collision before , no one could say exactly what the teams should look for , nor even exactly where the chunks would fall . So Hammel simply prepared as best she possibly could . She gathered all available information on Hubble 's cameras , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She meticulously choreographed her observing program . She lined up every dress , every shoe , every hairband in her closet with military precision . Given her preparations , the sight of the saturated image naturally came as a startling shock . The first fragment impact was one day away . And as she soon learned , all the red-filtered images taken up to that point were seriously overexposed , the green-filtered images slightly so . If the mistake went unchecked , it meant that Hubble would offer scant information on entire regions of Jupiter 's atmosphere during the event - an unrecoverable loss . " I thought , This just ca n't be happening . My life has ended , " ' Hammel recalls . Then things got worse . Hammel learned that there was no time to fix the problem . In five minutes the Space Telescope staff was to upload commands to control the telescope for the rest of the week . In fact , she and her colleagues would n't even have seen the glitch if they had n't just happened to be in the control room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the massive G comet fragment , when the image appeared on the screen . " I told the Space Telescope people , You do n't understand . We have to fix it , " ' says Hammel . " They said , We ca n't . It 's impossible . " ' After a few go-rounds , a back room huddle ensued , and Hammel prevailed . The Space Telescope staff made an unusual exception for the comet team , granting them five precious minutes to recalculate the exposure times . Five minutes later , the staff whisked away the comet team 's numbers . " By golly , they did their magic , " says Hammel . " Everything worked out fine .

Photograph Computer screens in Heidi Hammel 's office glow with images of her favorite planets ( above ) . Hammel led the team that observed Jupiter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( right ) . // By virtually any reckoning , everything worked out far better than fine . The sheer visual drama of the cataclysm those Earth-sized impact sites on Jupiter , the eerie black plumes - far exceeded astronomers ' exPectations , and the 400-odd Hubble images chronicled the action in extraordinarily rich and riveting detail . Astronomers came away with a mountain of surprising new data . Equally important , many members of the press and public came away newly inspired by the excitement of planetary astronomy , thanks in large part to Hammel herself . With her energy and ebullient , non-technical explanations ( she spoke of " smooshed-up comet " and jovian " black eyes " ) , Hammel countered the tired stereotype of the scientist geek . In fact , she very nearly edged out Jupiter as the star of the comet crash . Newspapers wrote appreciative profiles describing her passion for the Grateful Dead , for home-brewed beer . TV reporters nicknamed her " the comet lady , " and ran footage of her swigging celebratory champagne as part of the evening news . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community , as it turned out . " Champagne ? ! " beer connoisseurs sniffed over the Internet . " How could she ? " ) The Shoemaker-Levy 9 experience was unquestionably a pinnacle in Hammel 's career . But it is by no means the only peak she has scaled . Last year , the American Astronomical Society conferred on her its prestigious Urey Prize , an award recognizing a young scientist who has made outstanding contributions in planetary astronomy . Hammel received the award largely for her outstanding observational techniques and her painstaking studies of the outer planets ' atmospheres . And though this work lacks the overt glamour of her stint as comet celeb , Hammel approaches it with the same sense of mission . Indeed , all of Hammel 's scientific efforts so far seem to , share an animating theme : that the solar system is far more dynamic , active , and surprising than even many astronomers appreciate . Cramped , tidy , and largely unadorned , Hammel 's office at MIT offers only one visual reminder of her comet crash days : a misshapen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astronomer to resemble a Hollywood dressing room . What commands far more attention hangs in the corridor on the opposite wall : a huge photograph of Neptune , its bright clouds set off against a backdrop of deep aquamarine , taken by the Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1989 . Neptune is Hammel 's favorite planet , and she has spent the bulk of her career collecting information about its dynamic atmosphere . " The kinds of questions I ask are very simple , " she says . " What are the clouds like ? How fast do the winds blow ? " But if they are simple to ask , they are not easy to answer . Because Neptune lies about 4.5 billion kilometers from Earth , resolving the features on its tiny disk has always been an extremely challenging task . Hammel 's data , including ground-based observations taken before the Voyager 2 encounter , have added significantly to our basic knowledge of the planet . As Tim Dowling , a fellow astronomer at MIT explains , " Heidi was looking at Neptune long before most anyone knew it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with these wild cloud features , well before Voyager 2 . " Brad Smith , an astronomer at the Institute for Astronomy in Honolulu , Hawaii , concurs . " Her observational work is phenomenal . " Perhaps surprisingly , Hammel never felt any particularly astronomical leanings as a child . No conversion experiences while watching Carl Sagan 's Cosmos . No begging her parents for an observatory in the backyard . In fact , her career in astronomy very nearly ended before it began , while she was an undergraduate at MIT . Overwhelmed with a crushing course load , she 'd resolved to drop her first astronomy course . The professor , James Elliot , convinced her to stay , and even drove her to the school 's observatory , 40 miles from Photograph The Great Dark Spot dominated Voyager 2 's view of Neptune in early 1989 . The huge feature , shown here in false color , spanned more than 10,000 miles . // Cambridge , so she could complete an individual project ( taking pictures of asteroids with Polaroid film ) on a rare clear night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Are you still going to drop the course ? " " Nahhh , " she replied . " It 's too much fun . " ( She dropped a history course instead . ) Since astronomy continued to be fun , Hammel went on for graduate work at the University of Hawaii . There she studied everything from galaxies to the structure of distant stars . But she found that her true calling lay closer to home , in the planets of our solar system . For her , planets offered a particular kind of satisfaction : destinations for a questing mind . " You feel like you 're exploring when you 're doing planetary astronomy , " she says . " Maybe you 're not physically walking on the surface of the planet , but you are exploring it for the first time . You 're the pioneer . " It was partly this pioneering spirit that attracted her to Neptune and Uranus in the mid-1980s , a time when astronomers knew precious few details about the outer planets ' atmospheres . Hammel 's dissertation work involved taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloud structure . Her goal , as she put it matter-of-factly to a housemate one day , was to become the world 's expert on Neptune 's clouds . Whether this bold statement impressed hex housemate is unclear . But hex data , which showed surprisingly dynamic cloud activity , did impress Smith , who was leader ot the Voyager 2 imaging team . He invited her to join the large team . The experience was pivotal for Hammel , and , of course , the images Voyager relayed to Earth in 1989 were pivotal in altering people 's impressions of Neptune . Far from the benign and listless planet some expected , Neptune proved itself one of the most dynamic planets in the solar system . Voyager revealed winds ripping across the planet at up to 2,200 km per hour relative to the interior ; clouds forming and disbanding in mere minutes time ; and , most prominently , an Earth-sized , anticyclonic " Great Dark Spot " churning in the southern hemisphere . " It 's easy now to see how wrong we were about Neptune , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . We just assumed things would get less interesting as we moved away from the sun . Jupiter has those bright , contrasty bands . Saturn is a little more blah . Uranus is a virtually featureless disk , so we thought well , my God , Neptune is going to be horrible . Voyager changed all that . " Photograph Hubble images of Neptune ca n't rival those from Voyager , but they allow planetary scientists to chart the blustery weather and confirmed the Great Dark Spot 's demise . // Ironically , Hammel 's most recent work , using the Hubble Space Telescope , aims largely to supplant the Voyager view . Her quarrel is not with the stunning Voyager images themselves , but with what she sees as a widespread assumption that they tell the whole story . The dynamic planets are constantly revising the impressions that the spacecraft left in its wake , she says . After all , Voyager 's " last picture show " was clearly not the last word on Neptune , as Hammel 's and others ' work shows . In 1994 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff , Arizona , who reported that the Great Dark Spot had simply vanished , replaced by a new spot in the north . ( That new spot was apparently still there as of 1996 , according to Hubble images taken by Lawrence Sromovsky of the University of Wisconsin at Madison . ) Only ongoing observations will reveal how , and ultimately why , such mysterious features arise , Hammel says . " There 's a perception by non-planetary astronomers that heck , we can send spacecraft to these planets . Why should we waste our valuable telescope time looking at them ? " she says . " The less people know about these planets , the less people realize how profoundly they change . " In fact , if Hammel 's latest hunches are right , even Uranus - the under-achiever of the Voyager missions - may have biz surprises in store . Tipped on its side ( its axis of rotation tilts 98 degrees to its orbit ) , Uranus has always been an intriguing planet . But it 's not i exactly a " looker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flew by in 1986 . Even at closest approach , Uranus stubbornly remained what Dowling calls " a bland blue nothing , " with just a few bright clouds interrupting the haze . Significantly , Voyager flew by near Uranus 's solstice , when the planet 's southern hemisphere was beginning its 21-yearlong summer and the south pole received all the sunlight while the north saw nothing but darkness . Now Hammel and others wonder whether this was simply the dull season on Uranus . And if Uranus 's cloud activity does change dramatically with the seasons , it may soon be time for the planet to " bloom . " Hammel noticed a possible hint of this change last year , in a rather unusual manner . She was sitting at her desk , reading a Space Telescope press release about Uranus 's moons . Though she was n't particularly interested in the moons , she was keenly interested in the three well-exposed images of the planet 's disk that were tucked into the press pack . And there on the disk , she found something fishy : The clouds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relative positions of the clouds in the three frames , Hammel calculated the speed of the winds that carry them along . Then she compared those wind speeds with the speeds Voyager recorded a decade earlier at the same latitudes . To her astonishment , their pace had apparently slowed . For Earthlings accustomed to fluky , changeable weather , this might not sound like mind-boggling news . But on Jupiter and Saturn , the only other outer planets for which scientists have sufficient data , wind speeds at any given latitude seem to remain remarkably constant over time . Thus , Hammel 's finding , if borne out by further research , offers the first evidence of winds changing speed over time in a giant planet 's atmosphere . Photograph In the early 1900s , visual observations of Uranus revealed several faint bands reminiscent of those seen today on Jupiter and Saturn . Photograph Big , blue , and bland , the Uranus seen by Voyager 2 in 1986 showed few hints of having an active atmosphere . // Preliminary models of Uranus 's atmosphere , developed by Dowling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should change with season , as Hammel discovered . " At first I thought I 'd just screwed up the wind speed calculations . But when Tim and I talked about this , suddenly it began to click . I thought , wow , I 'm finding that the winds are changing ; his models suggest that the winds are changing . Maybe this is n't an accident , " she says . More exciting , Hammel , Dowling , and other planetary astronomers now suspect that this shift may foreshadow more dramatic atmospheric changes to come . Last October , in her Urey Prize lecture at the Division of Planetary Sciences meeting , Hammel offered some pictures of what this drama might mean . Instead of focusing on the latest images from space , she showed black and white drawings of Uranus , rendered by visual astronomers in the early 1900s . The pictures , reproduced in the classic book , The Planet Uranus by A. F. O. Alexander , depict a vastly different planet , decorated with bright , broad bands , and even the hint of something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn at a time when Uranus was between its solstice and its equinox , the same phase the planet is entering now . Of course , as Hammel acknowledges , astronomers ' high hopes for Uranus over the next few years may not pan out . " But that 's how science gets done , " she says . " Something happens that starts you thinking , and you follow it up . " Then she adds , shaking her head slowly , " And if you turn out to be right , and something really radical has happened , it 's such an incredible thrill . " Unfortunately , Hammel may not be scrutinizing Uranus as thoroughly as she 'd like in the immediate future . Her proposals to observe both Uranus and Neptune with Hubble were rejected for 1998 . ( Researchers from other institutions will be making observations , however . ) Perhaps more importantly , Hammel is also deeply involved in another , even more engrossing project right now : She and her husband , Timothy Dalton , a chemical engineer , celebrated the birth of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this major change in her life , Hammel has n't decided if what she 'd like to do next in astronomy . But whatever she does , she 's certain to continue sharing her work , and her awe , with the public . Hammel 's most cherished memory from comet crash week says a great deal about her perspective . It happened when she and her colleagues were strolling along the pier in Baltimore , shortly after the last comet chunk fell . There the group ran into an enterprising man with an 8-inch telescope . The man was offering turns at the eyepiece for a dollar a pop . So , one by one , the astronomers shuffled up for a look . " It was just an incredible sight , " Hammel recalls . " I had spent months planning the whole thing with Hubble . But I had never physically looked through an eyepiece to see what was happening . When I saw those black spots , it hit me right in the gut . This was n't something just for astronomers . It belonged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't need the power of Hubble to spot the outer planets during July . Easiest of them all to see is Jupiter-the brightest point of light in the sky from late evening , when it rises in the southeast , until dawn . Uranus and Neptune are trickier because they glow more dimly . ( You can glimpse Uranus with the naked eye , but you need binoculars to spot Neptune . ) See The Sky Show on page 66 for tips on finding these planets .
