<p> There is no new ice . There are no seats , no walls , no penalty boxes . There is no Zamboni , no scout named Moose , no tin foil ( " Want some coach ? " ) , no second assist , no Niedermeyer ( dead ! ) , no red line , no blue line , no bottom line . <p> There are only rumors . Oh , and applications . <p> " A lot of people have written , asking to be the general manager of a team we do n't have , " said Harvey Schiller , the president of Turner Sports and unofficial pointman for Atlanta 's NHL future . " I 'll be with someone - this happened to me twice in Europe - and they 'll say , ' You know , I love my job , but if you happen to get a hockey franchise . . . ' I mean , I get messages that so-and-so 's agent called and I 'll think , ' We need a reliever , we do n't need a general manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is new with Atlanta 's quasi- pursuit of an NHL franchise , new or existing , which would play at an arena that has yet to be built or even approved : There is still plenty of time to pick the first singer of the national anthem . <p> It probably will be at least three seasons before an NHL team plays here because an arena ca n't be built before then ( construction would n't start until after the Olympics ) . Schiller and fellow spinoffs of would-be NHL owner Ted Turner are n't enthralled with the thought of playing in a temporary home like the Omni or Georgia Dome for even a season ( " Unless there 's a firesale , " Schiller said ) . But here are a few ways to gauge where Atlanta stands in the current ice wars : <p> Before Quebec Nordiques president Marcel Aubut sold his team to a Denver group for $ 75 million , he phoned Atlanta . Schiller said he spoke with Aubut less than two months ago . " We spent some time analyzing it , " Schiller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have a new arena in place , it 's just prohibitive . " <p> Turner executives have had direct conversations with the NHL on the subject of expansion , as recently as three weeks ago . But NHL commissioner Gary Bettman decided to table expansion talk until after the Stanley Cup playoffs . Schiller : " They do n't know know whether their next expansion will be two teams or four teams and they do n't know when they 're going to decide . " <p> Bettman declined an interview with the Journal-Constitution on the subject of expansion . Even Ken Yaffe , the NHL 's director of fan development , responded to a number of questions about the Atlanta market with , " I 'm not in a position to comment on that . " Nothing like a sensitive subject . <p> Atlanta is one of a half-dozen markets the league is interested in , the majority of them in the West . But some consider the $ 75 million expansion fee or approximate purchase of an existing team outrageous for a league that lacks a lucrative television deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what convinced Richard Adler and David Berkman , co-owners of the IHL Knights , to be content with their minor league status . <p> ' The Chapter 11 League ' <p> Adler calls the NHL " the Chapter 11 league . " He adds , " When we got into this , the idea was to grow into NHL ownership . But the NHL the last three years has become suicidal . " <p> The Knights have been a success story , winning the IHL championship in their second year and seeing average attendance climb to 8,500 . The expansion franchise was purchased for $ 1.2 million three years ago . IHL expansion franchises now go for $ 8 million and Adler claims an independent analyst assessed the value of the Knights ' franchise at $ 13.2 million . Only a few of the league 's 17 franchises lost money this year . <p> Conversely , the NHL is swimming in red ink . Examples : <p> In a potential public relations disaster , the New Jersey Devils are on the verge of winning the Stanley Cup and moving it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Music City , meet Gary Glitter , Rock and Roll , Part II . <p> The Los Angeles Kings , two years removed from going to the Stanley Cup finals , reported an operating loss of $ 8 million last year , partly fueled by former owner Bruce McNall 's bankruptcy and pleading guilty to defrauding banks out of $ 236 million . The Kings secured $ 10.5 million in financing last week , enabling them to hire a coach and reimburse fans for unused playoff tickets . <p> The Hartford Whalers lost $ 11.5 million , the Winnipeg Jets $ 10 million . The Jets nearly moved to Minnesota recently but a deal fizzled . Both teams have dropped Atlanta as rumored destinations . Schiller : " We chase down these rumors and they stop at the city limits . " <p> Minnesota 's former team , the North Stars , moved to Dallas two years ago and owner Norm Green already is itchy to move or spread the debt . He may sell half the team to Ross Perot Jr . for $ 30 million . <p> Five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season ( Montreal and Toronto being the exceptions ) . In addition to the lockout that shrunk the season from 84 to 48 games , Canadians are dealing with a 73-cent dollar , despite the fact most players are played in American currency . <p> " They 've got problems , " said Adler . " The Quebec Nordiques were going to lose $ 25 million the next two years . Why would you go into a business like that ? " <p> Cowardly Lion on skates <p> The average NHL ticket price is $ 35 . In three years , it will be $ 40 to $ 45 , which Adler 's market research shows will lead to crowds averaging no higher than 12,000 - approximately what the Atlanta Flames averaged in eight years before owner Tom Cousins sold the team to Calgary . IHL ticket prices are one-third the cost but salaries for an entire roster are $ 1.5 million - compared to $ 20 million in the NHL . The biggest attraction to the Knights , Adler readily admits , is the ticket price , which averages less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers but bottom lines change when the Turner package is factored in . Even with the $ 75 million purchase price for an expansion or existing team , even with $ 20 million to $ 30 million in annual operating expenses , Schiller says an Atlanta team could work financially with average crowds of 12,000 to 14,000 . <p> An NHL team would provide programming to one of Turner 's networks , most likely SportsSouth , and revenue can be gained from advertising . A new arena also would create revenue from corporate sponsorships and luxury suites . <p> Then there is licensing . Sports is no longer about ticket sales but merchandising . Witness the financial success of the Anaheim Mighty Ducks , a team basically hatched from a Disney movie . Turner is n't an owner , he is TBS and SportsSouth and the MGM library and - well , how does the idea of the Cowardly Lion dressed in rollerblades and a hockey stick sound for a Christmas gift ? The NHL wants Turner as much , if not more , than it wants Atlanta . <p> NHL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this season despite the work stoppage , whereas Major League Baseball dropped off 16 percent to $ 2.1 billion . Sales were partly fueled by the expanding roller hockey market . <p> The South is no exception . Schiller disputes Adler 's suicide remark , saying , " The league is on the growth side right now . Go to Piedmont Park on any weekend and there are people with hockey sticks you did n't find two years ago . " The NHL has two teams in Florida and one in Texas , the IHL is in Atlanta and Houston , with New Orleans and Orlando to come . There are plans for a Southern Hockey League , with eight franchises including the Macon Whoopees ( imagine the T-shirts ) . <p> " Atlanta deserves a team and with all the people from the North here now , there 's no question it can support one , " said Bernie " Boom Boom " Geoffrion , the Flames ' first coach . " But if I could suggest one thing to Mr. Turner , it would be to buy the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't leave Atlanta <p> Schiller said that decision has n't been made yet , and wo n't until an arena deal is secure . Then it will be up to Adler to make the next move . He says the Knights wo n't leave Atlanta , regardless . His Omni lease has two years to run . " The analogy is , if the NHL is Neimen Marcus , why ca n't there be a Wal-Mart ? " Adler said . <p> In other words , the market can support both . Schiller agrees , even if it 's clear that competition is likely three years away . <p> " I 'll be right there when a team comes here , " said Geoffrion , still an Atlanta resident . " I do n't care where my seats are . I 'll be there . " Chart : Looking back at the Atlanta Flames <p> What : Expansion team in NHL that began play in 1972-73 .
