<p> The CNN makeup room is crowded . Moviemaker Oliver Stone drops happily into a chair to have his face wiped . He 's just done " Larry King Live , " and King has called his new film , " JFK , " which revisits every grisly detail of the assassination just in time for the holidays , " a full-blown operatic conspiracy tale " that has critics " raving and historians ... raving mad . " Stone is elated . One of his worst nightmares  --  and he has many  --  is not being taken seriously in Washington , but this seems to be fading somewhat in the glare of the public relations blitz arranged by Frank Mankiewicz of Hill and Knowlton , who was once Bobby Kennedy 's press secretary and who now stands in the doorway wearing a white shirt and bow tie and with a huge belly hanging over his belt like a guy who 's just stacked his 18-wheeler and walked into an all-night truck stop in Kansas . <p> But there 's a hitch . In the chair next to Stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known around town as the Prince of Darkness , perhaps for his dark-eyed glances , who knows . In any case , Novak is wearing a bright red Christmas vest and does n't seem to be in a great mood . <p> " How come you would n't let us in the screening ? " he snarls at Stone . <p> Stone winces visibly . Actually manages to crouch down in his chair . <p> He has no idea who Novak is . " How come we did n't let this gentleman into the screening ? " he implores of Mankiewicz in his soft wounded little-boy voice . <p> " ' Cause you 're only making trouble ! " Mankiewicz growls directly into Novak 's face . <p> " Well , I 'll make trouble anyway  --  I 'll be worse now , " snaps Novak . " I thought you were smarter than that , Frank . I really did . " <p> He exits in disgust . <p> Silence . <p> Then Stone smiles . " That was a good moment , " he says . <p> Stone has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several times in the past few months . Off-the-record lunches with the tweedier editors and correspondents . Deep-background chats with folks on the Hill . Op-Ed pieces . Appearances on " Nightline , " National Public Radio 's " Weekend Edition , " this and that . And yesterday , a private screening for a bunch of mass media types deemed acceptable by Mankiewicz , followed by a press conference and luncheon . <p> " It 's not the normal procedure , " admits Stone , settling on the couch in his suite at the Four Seasons the other day for a quickie interview before taking off for a benefit opening of the film in Dallas . " But it seemed to have to be done , because there was so much being written that was destroying the credibility of the movie before it was made , and it 's wrong . When Dan Rather editorializes against you on ' CBS Evening News , ' you know you have a problem . " <p> Stone 's problem is this : The film 's hypothesis , based on former New Orleans District @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is that a huge conspiracy  --  including the CIA , FBI , Dallas police force , the Mob , the military , LBJ and possibly the Tooth Fairy  --  brought off the murder of President John F. Kennedy on Nov. 22 , 1963 , as his limousine , having slowed for a curve , entered the carefully prepared " killing ground " at Dealey Plaza in Dallas at a speed of 11 mph . <p> In this view , there were three shooters , a deadly triangulation of fire . The perfect ambush , with the marksman on the grassy knoll having time for a couple of leisurely flat , straight shots right into Kennedy 's face  --  " he did n't even need a scope , " as Stone puts it . And the motive ? It was political . Not just because Kennedy was going to get out of Vietnam ( a view that most scholars say is simply unsupported speculation ) , but also because " he was trying to wind down the entire Cold War . In Kennedy we see a form of an early Gorbachev @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a statesman , reaching out for a detente . " <p> In Stone we see a form of a brilliant , passionate filmmaker reaching for larger and larger themes , who flunked out of Yale and signed up for heavy combat in Vietnam because he was so " unhappy " and filled with " self-loathing " that he " had a strong suicidal wish but I did n't want to do it myself . " Who then transmuted his " rage " into art  --  the scripts for " Midnight Express " and " Scarface , " then his direction of the Oscar-winning " Platoon " and " Wall Street , " " Born on the Fourth of July , " " The Doors . " And now " JFK . " Here 's a 45-year-old filmmaker who has taken much of the rage and disillusion of the ' 60s , ripped it out of his own guts , put it on the screen . <p> And everybody 's quibbling ! At least that 's what Stone thinks . Heck , he says , he hired 15 or 16 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight . So when Newsweek comes out with a cover story calling the film " Twisted Truth " and warning that " Oliver Stone 's New Movie Ca n't Be Trusted , " he is deeply hurt . The criticism , he tells Larry King , " comes from older journalists , political journalists who have a stake in their version of reality . " <p> Like Tom Wicker of the New York Times , who called the Garrison/Stone thesis " paranoid and fantastic , " and George Lardner of The Washington Post , who quipped that its " baseless claims come like fastballs . " Stone , faced with criticism from people like these , who have spent their careers in the gritty journalistic search for truth , is able to take refuge in the age-old mandate of the artist . In the Dallas Morning News he compared himself to Shakespeare shaping for all time the image of Henry V , and it is quite possible that years from now , when the work of Wicker and Lardner has gone to fish-wrap , Stone 's film will be viewed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " The artist 's obligation , in my opinion , is to his conscience only , " Stone says . " If he accepts the concept of social responsibility , it smacks of censorship . The Soviets told their artists that they had a social responsibility to realism . What is realism ? It becomes social realism . The Nazis told their artists you have an obligation to fascism , and they had to represent Nazi art . You can not tell an artist what to do . It 's the First Amendment . " <p> So why did he hire all those experts ? Why Frank Mankiewicz ? <p> " I believe an artist has to do his homework , but that 's my personal belief . Another artist may not have to do his homework . I did my homework ... . We did a lot of fact-checking . We openly admit that the film has quite a bit of speculation in it . " <p> Which is exactly why a lot of folks are so upset about it . <p> Yet who 's to say ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an overwhelming 56 percent , with 24 percent undecided , believe that a conspiracy of some sort was behind the killing , and not the lone , crazy gunman Lee Harvey Oswald , as the Warren Commission concluded . And in the summer of 1979 , the House Assassinations Committee reported that Kennedy was " probably assassinated as the result of a conspiracy " involving an assortment of gangland figures and anti-Castro activists . <p> All Stone is doing , he claims , is pointing out a possibility . " I 'm not making this movie to yell fire in the theater , " he insists . " I 'm not . It 's too taboo a subject and it 's too sacred a subject . It does n't do me any good to make a movie that stirs and boils everybody 's passion up , because that does n't necessarily lead to critical and financial success . Controversy can hurt you , it can backfire . You 're playing with fire here . " <p> Not a first for Stone . <p> In fact , this whole media battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adrenalin is up . " I feel like an infantry unit , " he says , " where I 'm basically low in the bunker and the bullets are flying over . " <p> The thought makes his dark eyes twinkle , and he laughs aloud . <p> A State of Rage Stone is a charmer , there 's no getting around it . A teddy bear , boyish and moody , with bushy dark eyebrows . That soft voice . He wears one of those Hollywood sport coat combinations where the jacket is just  --  perfectly  --  a little too big , so that when he sits at a table with his hands folded , for example , you ca n't see much of his hands . And when he moves he sort of flops around , gracefully though . You do n't automatically think of him as a family man , though he and his wife , Elizabeth , are the happy parents of two young sons . Not infrequently he 's been known to drink a lot , and at breakfast one day with some journalists at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh God , I 'm so hung over ! " <p> He says he 's very worried about being discredited as just another crazy Vietnam veteran , and yet the portrait he paints of himself is of a man full of terrible pain and angst , who is ultimately " saved " through his art in the classical and familiar romantic scenario . The son of a stockbroker who married his French sweetheart during World War II , Stone was a child of privilege  --  the Hill School , vacations in France , Yale . <p> He hated it all . In 1965 , still a teenager , he went to Saigon as a teacher . " I wanted to change my reality , " he says . " I had a turbulent adolescence . My mom and my father were divorced and there were a lot of social problems and family problems , and I wanted to get out of this country . I did n't like Yale . I felt that there was another world out there . I felt like I was being processed like a socioeconomic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> His literary heroes were Jack London and Joseph Conrad , who painted " this vision of the Far East as a salvation , as a second world , an orphan world in a sense . So I went out there , I saw it , I was really mesmerized and sucked up into it . " Then he went into the merchant marine , wrote a book , went to Yale , dropped out . " Emotionally distraught " and with " suicidal tendencies , " he enlisted in the Army as a private , frantic that the Vietnam War would be over before he could get into combat there . <p> " As the Charlie Sheen guy says in ' Platoon , ' " he recalls , " I wanted to experience the bottom of the barrel ... . I ca n't respect myself  --  if I can go to the bottom of the barrel , I can start over . I did n't want any privileges . I wanted to be anonymous . I wanted infantry , and I wanted ' Nam . " He got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cu Chi and then Dau Tieng , seeing heavy combat , getting wounded , seeing the " disgusting " corruption in Saigon , " the PX system , these fat cat sergeants with their liquor , the prostitution of the Vietnamese people . " <p> When he returned through Fort Lewis , Wash. , he realized that " the country was booming . The vast majority of people were totally indifferent to the war . I started to hide my uniform right away , tried to disappear into the crowd . " He split for Mexico , " to escape . I could n't stand it . California seemed like Mars . I went to Mexico and got into some trouble right away . I was in jail eight or nine days after I got back from Vietnam . " <p> Drug charges . " The jail immediately told me what was going on in America  --  with a capital K ... . There were 5,000 kids in a 2,000-bed jail in San Diego . I saw right away the problem , the civil war ... . I saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war was not just in Vietnam . " <p> The next few years were " a very dark period " for Stone . He lived in New York and worked on screenplays , went to film school , married his first wife , who managed to keep him somewhat glued together . " I had a very hard time in terms of my mental state , " he recalls . " During that Woodstock thing , I felt like a rage , I felt like , an anger inside that they were not serious about this counterrevolution , that if they really meant it , they had to get serious in order for it to work , that it had to be militarized and politicized . <p> " I felt like , stop screwing around with Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Yuppie or whatever his name is , Jerry Rubin ... . If the war is being fought in Vietnam , then let 's bring the war home , because you know , power comes from the barrel of a gun . I was into that concept . If you 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cadre of tough soldiers , people who had been over there , and the jail population , and try to make the revolution . " <p> He was " serious " about all this at the time , but realizes now that it was " an internal state of rage . Eventually , I mellowed , and it was integrated ... and I went to New York University film school , where I had the good fortune to be able to really funnel my anger and my rage into movies . " <p> Whew ! <p> Of course , the anger  --  whatever it was  --  kept smoldering away in Stone as he read , and listened , and watched . The Pentagon Papers helped him " understand the degree of duplicity of the government , with the fake body counts , the corruption , the immorality of the way we fought the war . " There was Watergate . The revelations about the Phoenix program . Deception after deception by the government . <p> " By the time the mid- ' 70s rolled around , " he says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fourth of July . ' They took on an increasingly political tone . " The eventual success of these two movies , he told Larry King , in a sense " gave me permission to attack another taboo subject , " the Kennedy assassination . <p> But is " JFK " fact , or is it fiction ? " The conclusions that we reached may seem to some to be hyperbolic , " he says , " but I think once you grant that there may be a political motive for Kennedy 's murder  --  the winding down of the Cold War  --  if you accept that assumption , then my conclusions about who and how are not so hyperbolic . " <p> How come he does n't help the viewer distinguish between the archived footage ( the Zapruder film etc. ) and the fictional , speculative scenes ? " What am I supposed to do , " he answers , " put a disclaimer before each scene , like a prescription drug label ? ... I think people are very smart . I think the point of the movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past that looking glass so that you 're part of the event , so that you can feel it and understand our hypothesis . You 're free to walk out of that movie and say this is baloney . You do n't have to accept it . " <p> How could such a big conspiracy hang together  --  hundreds of co-conspirators ? " I see a cellular organization , much like the battle of Algiers , " he answers . " Two or three hundred people can give silent assent , or 20 people . I never got up to 200 or 300 . I mean , it says clearly in the movie , ' It 's in the wind , it 's in the air . Nothing is on paper ... ' A lot of people hated this president , a lot of people in powerful positions . That does n't necessarily mean that they all meet in one place and say we 're going to cut the head off the snake at such-and-such a place . <p> " No , I do n't think it happens that way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wind . Calls are made . Discussions are had . At one point , at one secret point  --  the most secret point  --  a call is made . And there is a shot of a call being made to a man in silhouette . That person , whoever he be , is a technician . So there 's one call , to one technician . One technician activates . How does he activate ? Same cellular structure , moving down ! ... You do n't know who you 're working for ... . You have no evidence . " <p> Stone , leaning back into the sofa , talks on and on , apparently mesmerized by his inner vision . And given what we 've seen these last few decades , who dares call him crazy ? <p> Working Washington Meanwhile , Stone has apparently enjoyed his lesson in How to Work Washington . Has even learned a thing or two . Maybe there 's a movie in it somewhere , or a scene anyway . <p> After the King show , he crowds into the elevator with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Novak , " mutters Mankiewicz without completing the thought , " is sort of becoming the Robin Hood of ... " <p> " I did n't know , I called him Mr. Evans ! " says Stone . <p> " That 's even better , " says an aide . <p> Stone : " Is it Rowland and Evans ? Novak and Evans ? " <p> Aide : " Evans and Novak . " <p> Stone : " And they 're both on the right , is that correct ? " <p> Mankiewicz : " Oh yeah . " <p> Stone continues the questioning , about their column , their television appearances . Then , as the elevator door opens , he says brightly , " You missed the grimace he gave me ! "
