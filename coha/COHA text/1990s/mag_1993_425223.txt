<p> One week in the Clinton White House and you get the sense that the press corps and the press office deserve each other <p> FRIDAY , JULY 16 : I arrive in Washington mid-morning and call around to arrange interviews for a series of stories for the Los Angeles Times examining media coverage of the Clinton administration . My first calls are to George Stephanopoulos and David Gergen , both senior advisors to Clinton , and to Mark Gearan , the White House director of communications . <p> None of the three is in his office . <p> I leave messages and make a few other calls . No one is available . This is the first full day back in Washington for the president and most of the people I want to talk to ; his top aides and the reporters who regularly cover him have all just returned from the G-7 economic summit in Tokyo and from a visit to the flood-ravaged Midwest . They 're all understandably busy . <p> I arrange for temporary press credentials and go to the White House press room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar faces and introduce myself to several reporters I want to interview next week . I also attend Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers ' daily briefing for the White House press corps . The briefing is scheduled for 11:30 a.m . <p> It starts at 1:13 p.m . <p> That 's typical , I 'm told . Nothing at the White House ever starts on time . Clinton is habitually late . So is Gergen . Together , they are setting Guinness Book of World Records standards for tardiness . " Clinton has no concept of the traditional middle-class virtue of not keeping other people waiting , " Ann Devroy , a White House correspondent for The Washington Post , tells me . " He is extraordinarily self-absorbed . " <p> I later discover that this helps explain why the press corps was so antagonistic to the Clinton administration in its early months : Clinton 's " self-absorption " and the reporters ' self-importance collided to produce unprecedentedly hostile feelings and unprecedentedly hostile coverage for a new president so early in his term . There are other factors in the equation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and miscalculations , the post-Vietnam , post-Watergate cynicism of the press , the tabloidization of the mainstream media . Yet another collision was causing a lot of the friction , this one between Bill Clinton 's dilatory decision-making and the media 's demand for instant , incremental news . He thinks aloud and his aides pass on the ( seemingly ) definitive word on this program or that appointment ; reporters rush into print and on the air with the scoop  --  then the president changes his mind and pisses everyone off . <p> Pissed off is what many White House reporters were before Gergen rode to the rescue in late spring with enough political savvy and ego balm to begin turning things around . <p> Myers survives today 's briefing skirmishes and when she 's done , I introduce myself and we arrange an interview for next Wednesday . Gergen and Stephanopoulos are supposed to give a joint " background briefing " later that afternoon on the president 's policy on gays in the military . I decide to attend and buttonhole them afterward . <p> The briefing is scheduled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It starts at 5:07 . <p> " Gergen time , " the reporter sitting next to me mutters . <p> When the briefing is over , I grab Gergen and tell him I 'd like to interview him next week for my story . " Sure , " he says . " Call Diana Gergen 's assistant . She 'll set it up . " I go back to my hotel and call Diana . She 's on the other line . I leave a message . She does n't call back . Neither does Stephanopoulos or Gearan . I realize that the president 's staff is busy running the country and that my story is not  --  and should not  --  be a priority , but a little common courtesy would n't hurt . <p> MONDAY , JULY 19 : Myers ' daily briefing , originally scheduled for 11:30 a.m. , is rescheduled for 12:30 p.m . ( It actually starts at 12:45 . ) I use the morning to conduct a couple of interviews and make a few phone calls . <p> One of my first calls is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I call Gearan . He 's not in . I try Stephanopoulos ' assistant , Heather Beckel . She says she does n't have the president 's schedule yet so she ca n't figure out Stephanopoulos ' schedule well enough to give me an appointment . That 's reasonable . But that 's what she said the last time I wanted to interview Stephanopoulos and then she did n't call me back . I did n't get the interview until I found a way around Heather just five hours before I was scheduled to leave Washington . But Stephanopoulos had agreed to talk again when I came back , so I 'm willing to wait a couple of days . <p> Meanwhile , I go to the daily White House press briefing . At this one , reporters devote most of their energy to trying , unsuccessfully , to induce Myers to say more than she 's prepared to say about the president 's plans to meet with Attorney General Janet Reno to discuss the fate of William Sessions , the FBI director . It 's clear that Clinton is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't want to say so yet . Nevertheless , reporters keep questioning her about the issue . Seven different times she has to say essentially the same thing : " We 'll have more to say about the situation after the president has spoken with Janet Reno . " <p> I ask several reporters why they 're so determined to wring a definitive statement out of Myers at 1 o'clock when they 'll have official word from the president himself around 4 o'clock . For radio and TV reporters , an hour and a half can make a difference , says Helen Thomas , White House correpondent for United Press International . A difference to whom ? Do viewers , listeners , and readers really care if they hear about the dismissal of the FBI director three hours later ? <p> " I spend enormous amounts of mental energy to break a story that , three days later , no one cares who got it first , " concedes John-King , Thomas ' counterpart at the Associated Press . " Could I do better journalism if I did n't , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandon to get it five minutes before everybody else ? Yeah , I could . . . It 's probably childish , but I get a kick when CNN has to interrupt programming to say , According to the Associated Press , Clinton is going to . . . ' " <p> When I ask Myers why she thinks reporters badger her so much , she says , " Some people just like to give you a hard time , and it 's not necessarily connected to a news cycle . It 's driven by the absolute faith that we will not tell them the truth . " <p> TUESDAY , JULY 20 : Between interviews with various reporters and White House sources , I twice call Diana in Gergen 's office . She 's in a meeting the first time , on another line the second time . I call Gearan . He 's not in . <p> I go to the White House to talk to members of the press corps . My credentials , which were supposed to be available daily at the West entrance , are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get through to Diana in Gergen 's office . I explain that I 'd like to see him any time that 's convenient for him , up until 3 o'clock Friday afternoon . " I have a plane at 4:45 Friday , " I say . <p> She says she 'll get right back to me . <p> She does n't . <p> I call back . I 'm put on hold . After minutes , I hang up and call back . Diana says I 've got an interview with Gergen . <p> " It 's 6:15 Friday , " she says . I remind her I have a 4:45 mane to catch on Friday . She says she 'll call me back . <p> Meanwhile , Gearan and I miss each other on the phone . Then Heather calls and says Stephanopoulosc can see me at 11 o'clock Thursday morning . Moments later . Diana says Gergen can see me at 3:30 Thursday afternoon . <p> WEDNESDAY , JULY 21 : Vincent Foster , the deputy White House counsel , killed himself last night . The White House is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead , Gearan and Thomas F. ( Mack ) McLarty , the president 's chief of staff , will give a briefing on Foster 's suicide at 1 o'clock . <p> I call the White House press office to make sure my credentials will be waiting for me . " Do n't worry . We 'll take care of it , " one of the press aides says . <p> When I get to the West entrance , the Secret Service agents in charge say they have no record of any request for credentials for me . I phone in but no one there remembers my call from 15 minutes ago . Jeremie Gaines , the person in charge , is not there . <p> After another 15 minute wait , my credentials come through . When I tell Gaines what happened , he apologizes and says he 'll do his best not to let it happen again . " But it happens 30 times a day , " he says . " It 's the Secret Service 's fault . We send them the information . " <p> I walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'clock Gearan/McLarty briefing . It 's been postponed to 3 o'clock . At 2 o'clock , I go to Myers ' office for our previously scheduled appointment . Her assistant , Dave Leavy , the most helpful press aide I 've met so far in the Clinton White House tells me she 's swamped and ca n't do it . " I should have called you , " he says . " I 'm sorry , but it 's been crazy here . " We reschedule for 4 or 4:30 the next day . <p> The 3 o'clock McLarty/Gearan briefing starts at 3:38 . Both men seem shaken . And tight-lipped . In the weeks to come , the press will often seem ghoulishly insensitive and sensation-mongering in its pursuit of the Foster story . But today and for the next few days ' it 's the White House aides who makes me uncomfortable . They want to say as little as possible , even if it 's misleading . When reporters ask if Foster had seemed depressed or upset , Gearan says repeatedly , " He never said anything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As more comes out in ensuing days about how depressed Foster clearly was  --  and as the media frantically chase the story in quest of some presumed ( and presumed dastardly ) White House secret  --  I will become increasingly convinced that Clinton 's White House press aides and the White House press corps truly deserve each other . ( After all , Curtis Wilkie of the Boston Globe once rightly described the White House press room as " the only day-care center in America Ronald Reagan has n't abolished . " ) <p> THURSDAY , JULY 22 : I call the press office to make sure my credentials will be waiting for me this time . <p> " We 'll take care of it . " <p> When I arrive , no credentials . <p> I tell the agent at the gate that the press office says it 's the Secret Service 's fault . He bristles . <p> " If they fax it to us , it 's here ; if they do n't it is n't . " <p> When I 'm finally cleared , I interview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescheduled to 1 p.m . ( It actually starts at 1:32 p.m . ) . <p> After lunch , I see Gergen . Like Stephanopoulos , he 's a good , lively interview . Almost as important , he 's only 6 minutes late . No one believes me when I later tell them this . A mere 6 minutes late , I am assured , is an all-time punctuality record for him . <p> I head for Myers ' office . She 's busy . " Come back in 45 minutes . " I go off to make a few calls . Meanwhile , Paul Begala , one of the president 's top political advisors , wants to switch our Friday interview from 11 a.m. to lunch . Then Begala 's office calls again , resuming an earlier call of mine ; Begala 's partner , James Carville  --  the manager of Clinton 's victorious campaign  --  wants to see me . We arrange to meet at 9 o'clock the next morning . I go back to Myers ' office . <p> " Give us another 20 minutes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm ushered into Myers ' office . <p> When I leave , Gearan 's assistant grabs me . Gearan and I have missed each other on the phone several times and now he says Gearan is available . Bingo ! <p> FRIDAY , JULY 23 : I go to Carville 's office at 9 a.m. , as requested . " Typical James , " his assistant tells me . " He wo n't be here ' til 10:30 . " <p> I leave Carville 's office and call the White House to ask that my press credentials be waiting . " We 'll take care of it , " says a young press aide . When I get there , the Secret Service agent  --  who recognizes me by now  --  hits the keys on his computer and smiles . <p> " You 're cleared  --  for the press conference in the OEB Old Executive Office Building at 11:15 . " <p> " I do n't want to go to the OEB , " I say . " I did n't ask to go to the OEB . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to go to the press room , like I have every other day this week . " <p> I call the press office and ask why they have screwed up my credentials every single goddamn day . No one knows what I 'm talking about . But they say they 'll take care of it . I tell the Secret Service agent to hold my credential when he gets it . <p> I hail a cab , figuring that by the time I 'm through with Carville and Begala , the press office should have my credential snafu straightened out . When I return , it 's four hours later . The Secret Service agent checks his computer and says , " I 'm sorry , you 're still only cleared for the OEB .
