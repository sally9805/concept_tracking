<p> WHOOPING cranes , spotted owls , and the Poppers were on Mike Hayden 's mind in 1989 as he pondered spending $ 20 million to preserve waterfowl habitat in Kansas , where he was governor . The result of his musings is shaping up to be the most ambitious ecosystem management effort ever undertaken . <p> The Great Plains Initiative aims to unite a healthy environment with economic development . It 's ironic , but the arid landscape that became North America 's breadbasket with a surplus bounty for export sustains ever-decreasing numbers of people . Developing an ecotourism industry or subsidizing nature-preservation activities may offer the best hope of survival for marginally viable towns across the tri-national target area . <p> As governor of a plains state , Mr. Hayden was concerned about destruction of bird habitat , the primary reason for the rapid decline of many indigenous species . Today , 26 birds and more than 300 plants and animals in the Great Plains are considered candidates for listing as endangered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service . <p> Looking to the Pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and efforts to preserve the old-growth forest habitat of the endangered spotted owl . Warning signs that this " train wreck " was coming had been ignored for a decade , Hayden says . <p> In the Northeast , he recalled Rutgers University professors Frank and Deborah Popper , whose 1987 proposal to create a " Buffalo Commons " out of uneconomical farm and ranch land from North Dakota to Texas had underscored the plight of dwindling rural communities . Initially critical of the undiplomatic outsiders , Hayden says he recognized in their " startling " statistics what plains inhabitants could see but refused to acknowledge . <p> Hayden says he dared not ignore those " very real " trends . Suppose " another spotted owl " were to come along in Kansas , subjecting already struggling farmers and ranchers to the hardships borne by the Northwest 's timber industry ? That , he says , could be " the straw that broke the camel 's back " for many towns . <p> Yet no conservation effort by Kansas alone , he realized , would guarantee survival of a migratory species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state in their annual journey along the central flyway , a north-south transcontinental corridor . Other states and countries in the flyway were preserving critical habitat , he knew , but without overall coordination . <p> Hayden concluded that a management plan was needed that would take into account the entire Great Plains ecosystem , a region extending from Mexico into Canada and bounded on the west by the Rockies . ( The eastern boundary of the plains is problematic . Some scientists favor the 94th , 97th , 98th , or 100th meridian ; others the 20-inch or 25-inch precipitation line ; the 1,500-foot elevation contour ; the former extents of the short-grass or tall-grass prairies ; or even I-35 . ) <p> He foresaw jurisdictions , agencies , environmentalists , scientists , and citizens coming together for proactive , voluntary , grass-roots problem-solving . The initiative would aggregate data from hundreds of sources for the first time into a grand model of the Great Plains ecosystem . <p> Efforts would focus on the " weak links " in the chain , in whichever jurisdiction those might be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trigger a species listing applicable everywhere , with the attendant economic disruption and loss of local control . <p> Over the next two years , Hayden took the concept to the Western Governors Association ( WGA ) , which in June 1992 adopted it as the Great Plains Initiative . By then Hayden had moved to the Fish and Wildlife Service , where he was able to grant $ 200,000 to the WGA to get the initiative moving . <p> The Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) added another $ 500,000 to collect essential data and to survey public attitudes . Under one EPA grant , The Nature Conservancy has begun to map critical threatened habitat within the plains . A second grant went to Iowa State University 's Center for Agricultural and Rural Development ( CARD ) . <p> Last month in Kansas City , CARD convened scientists , officials , and " stakeholders " like farmers and landowners from plains states to explore common ground for action . The WGA , which cooperates closely with the governors of Mexican states and Canadian provinces , will hear the symposium results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In Kansas City , two points of agreement were clear : something must be done soon , and the ecosystem approach is the right one . As Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt testified to Congress : " Our national biodiversity resources will be conserved most effectively by means that recognize the interrelations of natural systems and look at the whole picture , which is far more than the sum of individual parts . " <p> " It is right to deal with crises involving individual species , " Mr. Babbitt continued , " but we should not manage our lands and resources so that we either consciously or unwittingly produce and then must react to an endless progression of crises . " <p> He could hardly have stated more precisely humanity 's history of meddling with the Great Plains . The Poppers refer to a century and a half of white settlement as " the largest , longest-running agricultural and environmental miscalculation in American history . " But that is only the most recent chapter of the long and difficult history of the plains . <p> " No part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapse so quickly and completely under that wooing as the Great Plains , " notes Dan Flores , a historian at the University of Montana . <p> Since the last ice age ended 12,000 years ago , humans have repeatedly inhabited and abandoned the drought-prone plains in a pattern of " ecological crashes and simplifications , " Mr. Flores says . <p> The first whites to emerge from the lush and majestic woodlands of Appalachia viewed the featureless prairie as deficient not only in resources but also in aesthetics . On maps it was marked as " The Great American Desert . " In 1831 , explorer Albert Pike praised the region in backhanded terms : " Its sublimity arises from its barren monotony and desolation ... " <p> This viewpoint found its way into popular fiction from " Giants in the Earth " to " The Wizard of Oz " : " When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around , she could see nothing but the great gray prairie on every side . Not a tree nor a house broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The lack of enthusiasm for the land in its natural state accounts for the fact that far less has been set aside for public parks than elsewhere in the US . In turn , that makes the cooperation of private landowners all the more essential to the Great Plains Initiative . <p> With cow and plow , whites began to settle the plains by 1840 at the urging of railroad advertisements depicting an agricultural paradise . The settlers disrupted the natural cycles of floods and prairie fires . They pushed aside the indigenous people along with the grizzly bear , the buffalo , the wolf , and the prairie dog . In a land that ancient inhabitants had called " the horizontal yellow , " native grasses disappeared before amber waves of grain . <p> The result was the ranching collapse of the 1880s and the Dust Bowl of the 1930s . New technology and practices have replaced failed ones , but Flores questions whether the innovations truly adapt to the dictates of the plains or in fact postpone that adjustment . <p> For instance , taking water from underground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 20 times the level seen when the Comanche Indians roamed there , Flores says . But depletion of the Ogallala ( N.D. ) aquifer is already curtailing irrigation . The economic life expectancy of the Ogallala is no more than 50 years , and possibly as little as 20 . Says Flores : " I see far fewer of us living here a century from now . " <p> The latest round of abandonment has long been underway . Out of 870 counties in the US portion of the Great Plains , only 100 are growing . Fully two-thirds peaked before World War II . A majority of the people who leave are young adults whose children would have offset natural decline , notes Richard Rathge , director of the North Dakota State Census Data Center . <p> " The plains do n't need abandonment , they just need a second source of income that 's not agriculturally dependent , " says Robert Sopuck , executive director of the Sustainable Development Coordination Unit for the Province of Manitoba , Canada . <p> He cites the example of Linton , N.D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by relocating some of its data-processing operation there , the experiment worked so well that the company is now Linton 's largest employer . The agency 's president describes the townspeople as " well-educated , dependable ... with superior skills and an old-fashioned Puritan work ethic . " <p> Margaret Thomas , a senior resource planner with the Midwest Research Institute , says that " Possibly the greatest hurdle before us will be confronting the reality that increased ' growth ' is no longer a sufficient goal for our society . " <p> " Our goal , " she adds , " needs to be an improvement in human progress , an articulation of deeper values , and a greater commitment to improving the long-term quality of life in an area . " Ms. Thomas calls for " rural enterprises that are based on stewardship rather than consumptive use of resources . " <p> That would be the ideal way to achieve the twin goals of the Great Plains Initiative . But if conservation ca n't be made profitable , should landowners be forced or subsidized to do it ? Rural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources like water and wildlife , Mr. Sopuck says . But urban dwellers must realize that biodiversity is a public resource supported at private expense . <p> " Public goods , to date , have not paid their way , " Sopuck says . " There are currently no markets for aquifer recharge , biodiversity , water management , duck production , or water quality . Somehow , we must create transactions in these public environmental resources if they are to have value .
