The giant sauropods led superlative lives <p> Sauropods , as paleontologist Walter Coombs observed , were beasts the size of whales , on legs of elephants , with tails of lizards , necks of giraffes , heads of horses , and nostrils of tapirs . In any description of these beasts , superlatives abound . Sauropods had the smallest brains relative to body weight of any group of dinosaurs , yet they were among the most successful of all dinosaurs . The first sauropods appeared in the Early Jurassic , almost 200 million years ago . They reached the peak of their worldwide diversity in the Late Jurassic , about 150 million years ago , and a few persisted to the dying moments of the Late Cretaceous , 66 million years ago . So far , their remains have been found on every continent except Antarctica . There were more genera of sauropods than of any other major group of dinosaurs . ( A genus comprises a group of closely related species . ) About ninety genera of sauropods have been named , but fewer than fifty are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains , and skulls are especially rare . This is a problem of taphonomy , or burial : these animals were so large that , most likely , the tail , head , and feet rotted away before the whole carcass was buried . Complete burial could easily have taken several years . <p> Indeed , sheer size is the most remarkable characteristic of the sauropods . Even a small sauropod was thirty feet long and weighed six or more tons . And the biggest ? We 're still trying to figure that one out . The largest , almost complete Diplodocus skeleton found so far is about ninety feet long . Very incomplete remains discovered by " Dinosaur Jim " Jensen , of Brigham Young University , in the famous Dry Mesa Quarry in western Colorado in the 1970s suggest that the tallest sauropod was Ultrasaurus , perhaps some 55 feet high , and the longest was Supersaurus , which may have stretched 125 feet from nose to tip of tail . A recent contender for top honors , at a possible 140 feet , is Seismosaurus , discovered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paleontologist David Gillette . Typical sauropods ranged in weight from ten to thirty tons . Barosaurus was a heavily built sauropod , although perhaps only eighty feet long . <p> How did these giants live ? What they lacked in brains , they made up in brawn . Gigantism was obviously part of their formula for success . But did they become too big for their own good ? Could they support their bulk on land or did they languish in swamps , submerged up to their chins in water ? What did they eat and how many hours a day did they spend eating it ? Were they warmblooded ? How did they reproduce ? And how long did they live ? Thinking about questions like these puts flesh on the bones and brings our heroes to life . <p> Sauropods were long thought to have been too large to move about freely on land and to have required water to help support their bodies . In 1971 , after studying the anatomical structure of the creatures ' limbs , feet , and rib cages , Robert Bakker , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sauropods were thoroughly adept , elephant-like terrestrial animals , not short-limbed , barrel-chested , aquatic beasts . <p> Bakker and I decided to examine the colorful outcrops of the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation in Utah , Colorado , and Wyoming , where the remains of the ancient behemoths have been found in abundance . Along with our colleagues Kay Behrensmeyer , now of the Smithsonian Institution , and John McIntosh , of Wesleyan University , we discovered that the sauropod fossils were by no means confined to rocks that indicated the presence of ancient swamps or lakes . At the Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry in central Utah and again at Sheep Creek in southern Wyoming , we found that skeletons had come from limy pond deposits . At the beautiful tilting bas-relief of Dinosaur National Monument in Utah ( where the American Museum 's Barosaurus came from , as well as three other kinds of sauropods and five other kinds of dinosaurs ) and in the picturesque cliffs of Garden Park near Canon City , Colorado , the ancient bones are closely associated with river channels that flowed across the Jurassic landscape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , near Fruita , Colorado , and at Como Bluff , Wyoming , all attest to dry savannalike conditions . We concluded that sauropods roamed across a broad spectrum of environments , going essentially where they pleased . <p> Furthermore , to our surprise , we found plant remains to be very uncommon . While large quantities of plant fodder were required to fuel sauropod bellies , little evidence of this verdure remained , having been oxidized to dust during the withering dry seasons . The bright hues of the Morrison sediments and the scarcity of plant remains contrast strongly with the pale colors and abundant plant remains in the Late Cretaceous beds of Alberta and Montana , where I have worked for the past ten years . During the Late Cretaceous , the lush lowland plains were awash with water . Seventy million years earlier , during the Late Jurassic , climates of western North America were dry and strongly seasonal . Sauropods may have wandered long distances following the rains in search of fresh salad . <p> But how much salad did a sauropod require ? This depends on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate . A convenient size unit is elephant size , roughly five tons . The smallest Morrison sauropod , Haplocanthosaurus , weighed about one and a half elephant units . Slender Diplodocus weighed two or three elephant units , stocky Camarasaurus six elephant units , and bulky Barosaurus and Apatosaurus as much as eight elephants . The giants weighed in at ten to twenty elephants . Relative to their huge bodies , most sauropods had small heads , more or less the size of horse or giraffe heads . Also , the teeth , although robust and often heavily worn , particularly in the camarasaurids , are simple in structure . <p> How could a beast this big , with a relatively small head , have gathered enough food in a day to keep alive , much less thrive ? Basically , the jaws and teeth were used simply to rake in foliage , which may have been reduced to small particle size internally in a gizzard . Sauropods may have also swallowed stones for grinding plants , but proof has been maddeningly difficult to come by . The West is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stones , which are commonly identified as " stomach stones "  --  even when dinosaur bones have n't been found within a hundred miles of them . Rarely are such stones found with sauropod skeletons . <p> Unlike mammals , sauropods did not waste time chewing . After being processed in the stomach , food was slowly digested in the intestine . Barosaurus may have had six tons of fermenting plant material in its huge gut at any given time . Elephants in the wild ingest about 375 pounds of fodder over a twelve-hour day . For sauropods the setting sun may not necessarily have curtailed feeding . The need to consume many hundreds of pounds of greenery a day may have made sleep a luxury . We have learned from studies of mammals that large animals are generally unselective feeders . Everything goes down the hatch : scratchy leaves , woody twigs , and chewy bark , as well as tender shoots and fleshy fruits . In the Jurassic , flowering plants did not exist . Available plants included cycads , cycadeoids , conifers , ginkgoes , horsetails , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle Mesozoic landscapes , and ferns probably constituted a major component of sauropod diets . <p> Did sauropods also feed at the treetops , beyond the reach of other beasts ? However appealing this image may be , it presents several problems . Brachiosaurus was built like a giraffe and may have fed like one . But most sauropods were built quite differently . At the base of the neck , a sauropods vertebral spines , unlike those of a giraffe , were weak and low and did not provide leverage for the muscles required to elevate and maintain the head in a high position . Furthermore , the blood pressure required to pump blood up to the brain , thirty or more feet in the air , would have placed extraordinary demands on the heart ( see opposite page ) and would seemingly have placed the animals at severe risk of a stroke , an aneurysm , or some other circulatory disaster . If sauropods fed with the neck extended just a little above heart level , say from ground level up to fifteen feet , the blood pressure required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may simply have served as a feeding boom for a stationary mountain of flesh . They could have lifted their heads with occasional graceful sweeps , blackout being prevented by using the carotid sinuses near the brain as reservoirs for blood . Sauropods were certainly capable of rearing up , or procreation would have ceased . But such a posture probably did not play a role in daily feeding activities . <p> Fossil footprints , sometimes arrayed in vast trackways consisting of hundreds or thousands of prints , attest to the herding behavior of sauropods . Fine examples of these have been found in Arkansas , Texas , and Colorado . Some of these have been studied by James Farlow , of Indiana University/Purdue University at Fort Wayne , and by Martin Lockley , of the University of Denver . The Davenport Ranch site in Texas is particularly informative . Here a few young individuals ( with feet twelve inches across ) were led by older individuals twice as large . <p> Their long legs would have made sauropods excellent walkers . Because the same kinds of sauropods are found over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the Late Jurassic climate was strongly seasonal with long dry periods , I believe that sauropods migrated widely on an annual cycle to follow the pattern of rainfall and plant regeneration . <p> Were sauropods warmblooded ? Their temperatures were both high and almost constant . Climates of the Jurassic were warm , and sauropod body temperatures responded only very slowly , on a time scale of several weeks , to external temperature changes . But did they have high metabolic rates ? This is the crux of the problem of understanding sauropod biology . Arguments about dinosaur metabolism are usually based on the physiology of tiny ectothermic lizards or endothermic mice . At large body size , however , the familiar differences begin to disappear . Unlike some of the smaller dinosaurs , the sauropods may not fit comfortably into warmblooded or coldblooded categories . <p> Biologists James Spotila , Frank Paladino , and Michael O'Connor discovered that the largest living sea turtle , the leatherback , has a metabolic rate nicely intermediate between those of typical reptiles and typical mammals . This metabolic strategy , which they called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ migrate long distances every year and maintain warm body temperatures even in arctic waters . Yet they also enjoy the benefits of reptilian energy conservation . I joined these researchers on the Costa Rican beaches to observe 750-pound turtles drag themselves ashore to deposit their precious eggs under velvet , moonless tropical skies . Then we returned to our computers at Drexel University in Philadelphia to apply leatherback metabolic rates to sauropods . Our computer simulations suggest that a thirty-ton , or three-quarters grown , Barosaurus with a high mammalian-level metabolic rate would have been at severe risk of fatal overheating . As Warren Porter , of the University of Wisconsin , put it , an endothermic sauropod in full sunlight at noon would have suffered meltdown . With a leatherback metabolic rate , only maximum blood flow to the skin would have maintained the body temperature in a safe range . Our model and those of others working independently suggest that only a reptilian metabolic rate offered a safe physiological strategy for large sauropods , especially those living in warm , dry climates . The large size of sauropods is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life in the slow lane . <p> Were these giants long-lived ? In general , longevity correlates positively with body size : large animals live longer than smaller ones , but coldblooded ones live longer than warmblooded ones of the same size . If sauropods had mammalian levels of metabolism , they probably grew quickly to maturity and had life spans of fifty to one hundred years at most . If they had reptilian metabolic rates , life spans would conceivably have been measured in centuries . Arthur Dunham , of the University of Pennsylvania , and his colleagues argued against warmbloodedness , but they believe that all dinosaurs were reproductively mature by the age of twenty at the latest , otherwise survival rates of the young would have to have been impossibly high to maintain the population . <p> Did Barosaurus lay eggs ? As far as we know , all dinosaurs laid eggs . But we really do n't know very much . Eggs and nests have been found in association with very few kinds of dinosaurs . The largest dinosaur eggs known , from southern France , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a small sauropod , Hypselosaurus . We have absolutely no direct evidence yet of the size of the eggs of the great sauropods . Eggs of the extinct elephant bird from Madagascar have five times the volume of the supposed Hypselosaurus eggs , so presumably no physiological reason prevented the development of even larger dinosaur eggs . <p> I view sauropods as somewhat stately , slow-moving titans . Others will disagree . Far from the pinnacle of dinosaur success , they were , I believe , archaic herbivores . Their large sizes , small heads , simple teeth , and tiny brains served them well for millions of years . But in the Cretaceous , more progressive , large-headed , larger-brained dinosaurs appeared , and vegetation changed . The moist lowlands of the Late Cretaceous , some 70 million years ago , had fast-growing , weedy , flowering plants and deciduous trees of small stature . In the drier habitats of the Jurassic where the sauropods thrived , the dominant plants grew more slowly . The teeth of Cretaceous duck-billed and horned dinosaurs were far more complex than those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far more efficiently than sauropods ever could . The old giants retreated to southern continents , where the newcomers did not flourish . Nonetheless , some kinds of sauropods straggled on to the close of the age of dinosaurs . Skeletons such as the Museum 's towering Barosaurus give testimony to one of nature 's grandest extravagances . <p> PHOTO : Camarasaurus stride across a mud flat as a Camptosaurus herd passes in the distance .
