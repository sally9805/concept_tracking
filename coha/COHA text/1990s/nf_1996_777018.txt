Veterans , Ethnics , Blacks , Women // Many things that middle-class Americans took for granted by the 1960s scarcely existed for the 139.9 million people who inhabited the forty-eight states in 1945 or for the 151.7 million in 1950 . Consider a few of these things : supermarkets , malls , fast-food chains , residential air-conditioning , ranch-style homes , freezers , dishwashers , and detergents . Also ballpoint pens , hi-fis , tape recorders , long-playing records , Polaroid cameras , computers , and transistors . And four-lane highways , automatic transmissions and direction signals , tubeless tires , and power steering . In 1945 only 46 percent of households had a telephone ; to get long distance , people paid a good deal and asked for an operator . In 1950 , 10 percent of families had television sets and 38 percent had never seen a TV program . Although 33 million of America 's roughly 38 million households in 1945 had radios , these were for the most part bulky things cased in wooden cabinets , and they took time to warm up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 25 million people , had no electricity in 1945. ( 1 ) // The United States in 1945 had become a more urban nation than earlier in the century . The Census Bureau reported that 96.5 million people , or nearly two-thirds of the population , lived in " urban " areas in 50 . But this definition counted as " urban " all places having 2,500 or more residents . The number living in places with 10,000 or more was 73.9 million , less than half the total population . And the number in places with 50,000 or more totaled only 53.3 million , a little more than one-third of the population . In many of the towns and villages the elm trees still stood in stately power , not yet destroyed by blight . Most American cities presented architecturally stolid fronts featuring a good deal of masonry and little aluminum or glass . Only a few , such as New York and Chicago , had much of a skyscraper center . Suburbs had long surrounded major cities , but there had been relatively little residential building in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suburbia was only beginning by the mid-1940s . Culturally as well as demographically the United States remained in many ways a world of farms , small towns , and modest-sized cities  --  places where neighbors knew each other and in which people took local pride . Mail came twice a day to homes . // Many aspects of daily life for most Americans had changed little between the early 1930s and the mid-1940s , years of depression and war . There were 25.8 million cars registered in 1945 , nearly one for every three adults . But this was only 2.7 million more cars than in 1929 , when there had been 18 million fewer people . Not many Americans in 1945 , as in 1929 , dared to travel by air ; if they lacked a car , they took a bus or a train , or they stayed close to home . Most still consumed " American " cuisine : roasts , fried chicken , burgers , fries , corn , tomatoes , pie , and ice cream. ( 2 ) People did not eat out much , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed in clothes made from natural fibers , which needed ironing and wrinkled badly in the heat . Business and professional men always wore coats and ties in public and never ( save when playing tennis ) appeared in shorts . Almost everyone , men and women alike , wore hats outdoors . People still thought in small sums : annual per capita disposable income in current dollars was $1,074 in 1945 . At that time it cost three cents to mail a letter and a nickel to buy a candy bar or a Coke . Relatively few Americans had hospital insurance or company pensions , though Social Security was beginning to become of some use to the elderly who had been employed . In 1945 urban families spent an average of $150 a year on medical care . All Americans did without such later developments as polio vaccines , birth control or hormone pills , and legal abortions , and they expected as a matter of course that their children would get measles , chicken pox , and mumps. // Young people listened avidly to popular new singers like Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : as yet there was no sharply defined " teenage " music . Irving Berlin 's " White Christmas , " introduced in 1942 , remained one of the best-selling songs ever , and Bing Crosby , Perry Como , Rosemary Clooney , and the Andrews Sisters sang hit after hit in a thriving pop music business that turned out 189 million records in 1950 , some 80 million more than five years before . " Country and western " music ( no longer called " hillbilly " ) was also booming , with Hank Williams producing a series of million-record favorites before dying of drugs and alcohol in the back seat of a car on New Year 's Day 1953 . Gene Autry , the singing cowboy , led the charts in late 1950 with " Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer . " ( 3 ) // Until the late 1940s , movies continued to be a favored form of popular entertainment , attracting a weekly attendance of 85 to go million people a year between 1945 and 1949 . Entertainment remained rather tame , at least by contrast to later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find nudity in films or magazines . No one at that time could have foreseen a popular culture featuring rock ' n ' roll , let alone a world of big-selling magazines such as Playboy ( which arrived on the newstands in 1953 with its famous centerfold of Marilyn Monroe ) . One historian has concluded : " The United States in 1950 still bore a resemblance  --  albeit a rapidly fading one  --  to the small-town America idealized in the Norman Rockwell paintings that graced the covers of the highly popular Saturday Evening Post . " ( 4 ) // " A culture , " the critic Lionel Trilling wrote in 1951 , is not a flow , nor even a confluence ; the form of its existence is struggle , or at least debate  --  it is nothing if not a dialectic . " The sociologist Daniel Bell later elaborated on this theme of culture-as-contest in maintaining that the United States remained a " bourgeois " society in the postwar years , even as it was developing an adversarial " modernist " culture. ( 5 ) Their observations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1940s , which were complex , diverse , and rent with anomalies and contradictions . The United States during these years  --  and later  --  was a bewilderingly pluralist society that rendered any static vision , such as Norman Rockwell 's , largely irrelevant . // Begin with an especially numerous and visible group : servicemen and their families . In all , 16.4 million Americans , the vast majority of them young men , joined the armed services during World War II . More than 12.1 million of them were still in uniform in early August 1945 . This was nearly two-thirds of all American men aged 18 to 34 at the time . Young , numerous , male in a male-dominated culture , and eager to make up for time " lost " during the war ( and , for many , during the Depression ) , the returning veterans placed a firm stamp on American culture and society during the 1940s and thereafter . Their experiences , while varying according to regional , racial , class , and personal circumstances , offer revealing angles of vision into cultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men had volunteered or been taken without a fuss by the draft . Like most Americans , they were deeply patriotic , and they had served because it was their duty . Many had fought bravely . But most of them , polls suggested , had not cherished idealistic notions about destroying fascism or building a brave new world . One poll in September 1945 found that 51 percent of American soldiers still in Germany thought that Hitler , while wrong in starting the war , had nonetheless done Germany " a lot of good . " More than 60 percent of these men had a " very favorable " or " fairly favorable " view of Germans  --  about the same percentage that viewed the French in this way. ( 6 ) Many American soldiers also resented the special privileges enjoyed by officers. ( 7 ) Stars and Stripes said , " A caste system-inherited from Frederick the Great of Prussia and the 18th century British navy is hardly appropriate to the United States . . . the aristocracy-peasantry relationship characteristic of our armed forces has a counterpart nowhere else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late 1945 the soldiers and sailors wanted above all to come home , get out of the service , and rejoin their families . Many deluged hometown newspapers and members of Congress with demands for transport home and release from military duty . " No boats , no votes . " Their wives and girlfriends were equally anxious to get on with " normal " life . Many wives sent angry pleas , along with baby booties , through the mail to Capitol Hill . An anonymous GI poet added : // Please Mr. Truman , wo n't you send us home ? We have captured Napoli and liberated Rome ; We have licked the master race , Now there 's lots of shipping space , So , wo n't you send us home ? Let the boys at home see Rome. ( 9 ) // The clamor of GIs largely succeeded . Demobilization proceeded at a very rapid pace . By June 1946 the number in service had dropped to 3 million , and Congress had agreed to authorize an army of only I million by July of 1947 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But like veterans throughout history , they found that life had gone on without them . Many , yanked from home for years , deeply resented civilians who had stayed out of the service and prospered . Seizing chances to move ahead , more than 8 million " vets " took advantage of the " 52-20 " provision of the GI Bill of Rights , which provided $20 per week for up to fifty-two weeks of unemployment ( or earnings of less than $100 a month ) . A form of affirmative action ( a phrase of later years ) , the GI Bill cost $3. 7 billion between 1945 and 1949. ( 10 ) Other veterans , including thousands who had married hastily while on wartime leave , could not adjust to married life . The divorce rate in 1945 shot up to double that of the prewar years , to 31 divorces for every 100 marriages  --  or 502,000 in all . Although the divorce rate dropped in 1946 and returned to prewar levels by the early 1950s , its jump in 1945 exposed the rise of domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these tensions were captured in a revealing Hollywood film , The Best Years of Our Lives ( 1946 ) . Based on a novel by MacKinlay Kantor , it won nine Academy Awards . As befitting a product of Hollywood , it ended on an upbeat note by affirming the quest for security of three veterans returning to Boone City , an archtypical American community . But the title is also ironic and the story disquieting-so much so , in fact , that the right-wing House Committee on Un-American Activities later considered questioning the writer Robert Sherwood about the script . // In the course of readjusting to civilian life the movie 's three veterans encounter , sometimes bitterly , what they perceive as the runaway materialism and lack of patriotism of postwar American society . One veteran ( Fredric March ) gets a job as a loan officer at a bank , only to be chastised by higher-ups for softness to struggling veterans seeking assistance . " Last year , " he complains , " it was kill Japs . This year it 's make money ! " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Myrna Loy ) and his grown children . The second vet ( Dana Andrews ) at first can not find his wife ( Virginia Mayo ) , whom he had married after a brief courtship during the war . When he locates her  --  she is a nightclub performer  --  he realizes that she is tough and self-centered . Soon she leaves him . He finally lands menial " women 's work " in a heartless chain store , but there he encounters a grouchy male customer who criticizes the war and all who fought in it . Furious , the veteran slams him in the jaw and is fired . In the end he finds a job helping a company use discarded war planes for the building of prefabricated houses . The third veteran lost both hands in the war and manages with hooks instead . But he feels useless in an acquisitive society , faces terrible problems of readjustment , and survives only because of the love of his loyal girlfriend next door. ( 11 ) Though the ending is schmaltzy , there was bite enough in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation . The Best Years of Our Lives captured rather well the stresses encountered by many veterans and their families in the immediate aftermath of war . // THE EXPERIENCES of America 's diverse ethnic and racial groups , while defying easy categorization , also revealed some of the tensions of postwar American society . The nation 's population of 139.9 million in 1945 included nearly 11 million foreign-born and 23.5 million people of foreign-born or mixed parentage . Most of these 34.5 million people , 25 percent of the population , were of European descent , including some 5 million whose roots were in Germany , 4.5 million from Italy , 3.1 million from Canada , 2.9 million from Poland , 2.8 million from Great Britain , 2.6 million from the USSR , and 2.3 million from Ireland ( Eire ) . Substantial numbers also hailed originally from Austria , Hungary , Czechoslovakia , Sweden , and Norway . Many more Americans , of course , had European roots dating from the third generation or farther back . Negroes , as most people then called African-Americans , numbered nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The census identified a much smaller number , 1.2 million , as people of Mexican background , though there were many others ( no one knew how many ) who made themselves scarce at enumeration time . The Mexicans and Mexican-Americans were concentrated in a few places , mostly in Texas , the Southwest , and southern California . In Los Angeles they were already numerous enough during the war to frighten white residents , who launched gang attacks on them in the streets . By contrast Asians , mast of whom had long been excluded from the United States by racist immigration laws , were numerically tiny in 1945 : Chinese-Americans numbered around 100,000 , Japanese-Americans around 130,000 . There were approximately 350,000 people who told the census-takers that they were Indian ( Native American ) . ( 12 ) // Some of these people , such as Japanese-Americans , suffered greatly during the war . Others , such as the majority of Indians , continued to live in an especially dismal poverty . But many other ethnic groups were better off in the late 1940s  --  or at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The war , in so many ways a powerful force in the domestic history of twentieth-century America , was an engine that accelerated acculturation . Millions of Negroes and first- and second-generation Americans served in the armed forces or pulled up stakes to work in defense plants , thereby leaving their enclaves and mixing for the first time with " old-stock " white people . Having joined in the war effort , they also came to identify more emotionally with the United States . As Cold War tensions mounted over the next two decades , many European-Americans , especially those who had roots behind the iron curtain , emerged as among the most patriotic  --  and super-patriotic  --  of United States citizens. ( 13 ) // Still , it was wrong to assume , as many hopeful observers did at the time , that the war and acculturation were working some kind of amalgamating magic . Regional tensions and differences , especially North versus South , remained profound . So did ethnic feelings . Laws from the 1920s had drastically reduced legal immigration , thereby cutting the percentage of foreign-born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent . This was the lowest percentage  --  to that time  --  in twentieth-century American history . But the nation was still far from having become a melting pot in which ethnic and religious differences had fused into a common " American " nationality. ( 14 ) // Religious differences , indeed , remained very strong in the 1940s . Some 71.7 million Americans , more than half the population , said they belonged to religious groups in 1945 , roughly 43 million of them in Protestant denominations , 23 million Catholic , and nearly 5 million identifying themselves as Jewish. ( 15 ) These people inhabited an increasingly secular world in which theological dictates carried less weight than in earlier generations but in which church membership was nonetheless increasing , from 49 percent of the population in 1940 to 55 percent in 1950 ( and to an all-time high of 69 percent by 1959 ) ( 16 ) Whether church-going much affected personal behavior of course sparked many debates , but the upward trend in attendance was noteworthy and impressive . More and more Americans obviously considered it important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Few Western populations , including the Catholic countries of Europe , came close to matching America 's record of church-going in the postwar years . // It was difficult , moreover , to find much of an ecumenical spirit among these religious Americans . Protestant denominations still evoked strong loyalties in the 1940s and early t950s . Conservative evangelical groups became more active , forming in 1947 the Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena and benefiting from the formidable recruiting talents of spellbinders like the youthful Billy Graham , then in the conservative wing of American Protestantism. ( 17 ) Anti-Catholic feelings remained strong . Paul Blanshard 's polemically anti-Catholic American Freedom and Catholic Power ( 1949 ) was a best-seller for six months . It attacked the Catholic Church for what Blanshard considered its support of reactionary governments , its repressive attitude toward questions of personal morality , and its hierarchical organization , all of which Blanshard said were intrinsically un-American . Blanshard focused especially on the inflammable contemporary issue of state aid to parochial schools , which the Supreme Court upheld by a 5-to-4 decision in 1947. ( 18 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusion . They confronted systematic discrimination in gaining entrance to prestigious colleges , universities , and professional schools , and in securing teaching tenure . It was hardly surprising that most Jews and Catholics  --  many of them among the first- and second-generation immigrant population  --  clung , often resentfully , to their churches , synagogues , clubs , and neighborhoods. // Many of these " new-stock " Americans , though relatively poor at the close of World War II , had acquired property , which they cherished as a sign of their social mobility and which further deepened their commitment to their neighborhoods . ( In Chicago , foreign-born residents actually had higher rates of home-ownership than others in the city ) . ( 19 ) These and other first- and second-generation Americans embraced often quite separate subcultures featuring neighborhood festivals , schools , churches , and above all their extended families. ( 20 ) They cherished their own cuisine and modes of dress and supported a flourishing foreign-language press . In the early 1940s there were 237 foreign-language periodicals in New York City , 96 in Chicago , 38 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole , with a circulation of 7 million . Roughly : z million people , one-seventh of the population , told census enumerators in 1940 that English was not their native tongue. ( 21 ) // The lives of black Americans in the late 1940s , like those of America 's more recent immigrants , also improved on the average . Thanks in part to the rapid mechanization of cotton production in the early 1940s , which ultimately threw millions of farm laborers out of work , and in part to the opening up of industrial employment in the North during the wartime boom , roughly a million blacks ( along with even more whites ) moved from the South during the 1940s . Another 1.5 million Negroes left the South in the 1950s . This was a massive migration in so short a time  --  one of the most significant demographic shifts in American history  --  and it was often agonizingly stressful. ( 22 ) The black novelist Ralph Ellison wrote in 1952 of the hordes of blacks who " shot up from the South into the busy city like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that our gait becomes like that of deep-sea divers suffering from the bends . " ( 23 ) // Still , many of the migrants gradually reaped unprecedented benefits . The number of Negroes employed in manufacturing jumped from 500,000 to 1.2 million during the war . The percentage of employed black women who worked as domestic servants  --  before the war one of the few jobs they could get  --  declined from 72 to 48 during the same period . Blacks also advanced on other fronts , which seem token in retrospect but represented notable achievements at the time . In 1944 for the first time a black reporter was admitted to a presidential press conference ; in 1947 blacks gained access at last to the Senate press gallery. ( 24 ) Thanks in part to legal pressure from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) , the Supreme Court in 1944 outlawed the " white primary , " a ploy that had enabled states in the South to exclude blacks from all-important Democratic primary races. ( 25 ) In 1946 the Court ruled against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1945 Branch Rickey of the Brooklyn Dodgers signed the black baseball star Jackie Robinson to a minor league contract . It was understood that if he was good enough he would become the first Negro player in modern times to play in the Big Leagues . In 1947 he did , beginning a career of stardom with the Brooklyn team. ( 27 ) // Many of these changes came because blacks themselves demanded them . As early as 1941 A. Philip Randolph , head of the all-Negro sleeping-car porters , union , had threatened a " march on Washington " if the federal government did not act against rampant discrimination in the armed services and publicly contracted employment . To prevent the march , President Roosevelt gave in and issued an executive order against such treatment . He also set up a Fair Employment Practices Commission ( FEPC ) to oversee things . The order was widely evaded , but Randolph 's boldness nonetheless encouraged blacks to pursue further protest . The Pittsburgh Courier , a leading black newspaper , demanded a " Double V " during the war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . Civil rights leaders recognized that ordinary blacks were growing more and more restless and angry . Roy Wilkins , a leader of the NAACP , wrote a fellow activist in 1942 , " It is a plain fact that no Negro leader with a constituency can face his members today and ask full support for the war in light of the atmosphere the government has created . " ( 28 ) The groundswell of protest was indeed growing : membership in the NAACP , by far the most important civil rights organization , increased from 50,000 to 450,000 during the war . // Students of the " Negro problem " in the early 1940s had grand expectations about the potential for this groundswell . This feeling especially gripped the scholars who collaborated with Gunnar Myrdal , the Swedish social scientist who published in 1944 An American Dilemma . This was a much-acclaimed study of race relations in the United States . The " dilemma , " Myrdal thought , stemmed from the historic conflict between the " American Creed " of democracy and equality and the reality of racial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injustice , identifying the " vicious circle " of prejudice and discrimination that had victimized black people in the United States . But he had faith in American ideals , and he was optimistic about the future . Negroes , he argued , could no longer be regarded as a " patient , submissive majority . They will continually become less well , accommodated. , they will organize for defense and offense . They will become more and more vociferous . " Whites , he added , would surely resist change . " The white man can humiliate the Negro ; he can thwart his ambitions ; he can starve him . " But whites did " not have the moral stamina to make the Negro 's subjugation legal and approved by society . Against that stands not only the Constitution and the laws which could be changed , but also the American Creed which is firmly rooted in the Americans , hearts . " Not since Reconstruction , Myrdal wrote with emphasis , " has there been more reason to anticipate fundamental changes in American race relations , changes which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 29 ) // With the advantage of hindsight it is clear that An American Dilemma had its limitations as analysis . Myrdal and his collaborators were first of all too affirmative , too optimistic about the potential of the " American Creed . " White racial prejudice and structural discrimination proved to have great staying power . Second , Myrdal assumed that whites would lead the way to change : like most people in the 1940s , he underestimated the rage and determination of blacks , who were stirring to take matters into their own hands . As Ellison 's black protagonist exclaimed in Invisible Man , " You ache with the need to convince yourself that you do exist in the real world , that you 're part of all the sound and anguish , and you strike out with your fists , you curse and you swear to make them whites recognize you. ( 30 ) This did not happen much in the 1940s , but it did in the 1960s , when advocates of " black power " pushed whites out of the civil rights movement . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In practically all its divergences , " he wrote , " American Negro culture is not something independent of general American culture . It is a distorted development , or a pathological condition , of the general American culture . " An American Dilemma deplored the " high Negro crime rate , " as well as the " superstitition , personality difficulties , and other characteristic traits that are mainly forms of social pathology . " Myrdal concluded , " It is to the advantage of American Negroes as individuals and as a group to become assimilated into American culture , to acquire the traits held in esteem by the dominant white Americans. ( 31 ) // During the racial confrontations of the 1960s , An American Dilemma encountered rising criticism from activists and scholars who disputed Myrdal 's optimism about white liberalism , as well as his negative statements about certain aspects of African-American culture . In the mid- and late 1940s , however , the study received virtually unsparing praise . W.E.B . Du Bois , the nation 's most distinguished black historian and intellectual , hailed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So did other black leaders , ranging from the sociologist E. Franklin Frazier , whose criticisms of lower-class black culture influenced Myrdal 's arguments , to the novelist Richard Wright , whose bitter autobiography , Black Boy , appeared in 1945 . Prominent white intellectuals  --  the theologian Reinhold Niebuhr , the sociologist Rollert Lynd , the historian Henry Steele Commager  --  concurred in this approbation . The near unanimity in support of Myrdal 's message reflected the rising expectations among liberals for racial and ethnic progress at the close of the war . // Amid this atmosphere of hope , activists for racial justice pressed for change on a number of fronts in the mid- and late 1940s . One front was to desegregate the military . Some blacks , like Bayard Rustin , refused to submit to the draft  --  partly on pacifist grounds , partly in protest against Jim Crow in the armed services . He went to prison for his temerity . Most American Negroes , however , were ready and willing to fight : they composed 16 percent of Americans enlisted in the armed services during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the population . Approximately a million Negroes served between 1942 and 1945 . But they confronted discrimination at every turn . The navy accepted Negroes only for menial tasks , often to serve as mess attendants . The army took in blacks but set up segregated training camps and units and refused to train blacks as officers . It also assumed that Negroes were poor fighters and hesitated to send them into combat . Secretary of War Stimson explained that blacks should serve under white officers , because " leadership is not imbedded in the Negro race yet and today to make commissioned officers lead men into battle  --  colored men  --  is only to work a disaster to both . " ( 32 ) // By 1944 the protests of blacks  --  for Randolph and other leaders military desegregation was a top priority  --  had a modest effect on the armed services . The navy slowly moved toward integrated units . The army , at a loss for manpower during the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944 , pressed blacks into combat , with positive results . But segregation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My God ! My God ! " army chief of staff General George Marshall exclaimed , " I do n't know what to do about this race question in the Army . " He added , " I tell you frankly , it is the worst thing we have to deal with . . . . We are getting a situation on our hands that may explode right in our faces . " ( 33 ) Though Marshall did nothing about the situation , he correctly assessed the more militant mood . A black Alabama corporal explained in 1945 , " I spent four years in the Army to free a bunch of Dutchmen and Frenchmen , and I 'm hanged if I 'm going to let the Alabama version of the Germans kick me around when I get home . No sirreee-bob ! I went into the Army a nigger ; I 'm comin ' out a man . " ( 34 )
