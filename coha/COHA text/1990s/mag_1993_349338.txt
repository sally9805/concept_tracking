PERFORMER : CHRIS ISAAK <P> ALBUM : SAN FRANCISCO DAYS <P> LABEL : REPRISE <P> THE BOTTOM LINE : No longer just another pretty voice , retro-rocker Isaak forges ahead on disc and the big screen . <P> With his Ricky Nelson profile , Roy Orbison pipes and Elvis Presley moves , Chris Isaak could easily be dismissed as a pretender to the retro throne , a rockabilly Milli Vanilli coasting on his looks and the popular pining for the spirit of rock ' n ' roll past . But as anyone who has listened to his records or seen him perform knows , Isaak is the genuine article : a pompadoured anachronism who grew up in the blue-collar cow town of Stockton , California , listening to Dean Martin , Louis Prima and Hank Williams Senior . By putting a cutting-edge gloss on a vintage 1950s and early ' 60s sound , Isaak , like Lyle Lovett and k.d. lang , avoids parody by dint of sheer talent and a playful sense of irony . <P> On San Francisco Days , Isaak continues to refine a style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the strum and twang of the lonesome-cowboy blues . Backed by spare , guitar-centered arrangements , Isaak 's compositions convey the aching pang of emotion without ever sounding wimpy . On Beautiful Homes his rich tenor throbs with vulnerability as he sings , " I stare at your window and I cry/ I love you so much/ I love you too much . " He brings equal ardor to Two Hearts , a Latin-tinged Valentine levitated by his soaring falsetto , and a stirring remake of Neil Diamond 's Solitary Man , which he transforms into an existential anthem for tough-yet-sensitive guys . When Isaak sings , " Me and Sue  --  that died too , " his voice almost cracks with manly anguish . <P> If such brazen baring of feelings is unhip , Isaak does n't care . " Sophistication is the subtle art of trading away all your gems for a bunch of junk , " he says . During the ' 70s , while his peers were turning on and dropping out , Isaak  --  who neither smokes nor drinks  --  was in Japan as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to break into the movie business . His first credit : a walk-on part in a Japanese World War II film in which he played a lubricious American G.I. <P> Moving to San Francisco in the early ' 80s , Isaak formed a band and started playing in Bay Area clubs , eventually attracting an ardent following that included Bruce Springsteen and Rickie Lee Jones . Another early fan was director Jonathan Demme , who cast Isaak in cameo bits in his films Married to the Mob ( Remember the fast-food clown who tried to rub out Tony the Tiger ? ) and Silence of the Lambs ( as a SWAT team member ) . He had a few lines of dialogue in David Lynch 's Twin Peaks : Fire Walk with Me , but his biggest break came last year , when director Bernardo Bertolucci invited him to play the American father of a reincarnated Tibetan lama in Little Buddha , due to be released for Christmas . <P> Until Hollywood calls again , Isaak , who will tour with his band in the U.S. and Europe this summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love . " I want to sing every day , " he says . " I 've had girlfriends who said , ' Every time you 're upset , you grab your guitar . ' " And if you can believe him , he grabs it a lot . " Being happy or unhappy has got very little to do with how much stuff you have or how well your career is going , " he explains . " But I have n't given up hope . I 'm still trying . "
