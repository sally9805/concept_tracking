Turning out Academy Award-winning films is no guarantee of financial success , or even survival . Just ask Orion Pictures , which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last week . Despite such recent commercial and artistic hits as Dances with Wolves and Silence of the Lambs , the studio , known for * allowing directors considerable creative freedom , was unable to support $570 million in debt and other obligations . The bankruptcy was triggered when bondholders decided to halt final negotiations on a deal to swap $285 million of debt for 70% of the motion-picture studio 's stock . <P> Unlike its main competitors , Orion , founded in 1982 , lacks a rich corporate parent to help finance the skyrocketing cost of film production , marketing and distribution . To make ends meet , Orion even had to sell off the theatrical rights to a major film it had developed , The Addams Family , which already has grossed more than $67 million for rival studio Paramount Pictures .                 @ @ @ @
