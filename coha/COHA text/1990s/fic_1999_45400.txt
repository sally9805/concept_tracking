Come see my dad 's fish , " Eric Gudmundsson says , standing close enough that I can smell his candy-scented breath . He is six , the youngest of three boys . He has a sharp , thin nose and blue eyes that you ca n't see to the bottom of and dirty blond hair that sticks up in tufts , like prairie grass . His ears are large , like those of a woodland spirit , but he is slight , no heavier than a few bones packed in excelsior . He runs around with my son , Louis , though Louis will sometimes abandon him for another child . <p> " What kind of fish did your dad catch ? " I ask , trying to keep annoyance out of my voice . Before Eric entered , I was grading exams for my Italian I03 class and listening to a scratchy mono recording of La Boheme that I got at a yard sale . By the end of Act I , my house had emptied . First , Louis went down to the Gudmundssons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neighborhood for his bike . It was stolen from our garage last week , the day before Easter , when the air was briefly warm and it looked as if spring might be taking root in our part of Wisconsin . <p> Eric describes the fish as " big ones , bigger than Cassius . " He points to our elderly cat , who sits as still as an idol on a chair by the window , gazing out . Spring is in retreat . Snow fell two days after Easter-like fallout from the Resurrection , one of my colleagues said-and there are still blobs of it on the ground . <p> I say , " Maybe I 'll come see your dad 's fish a little later . " I hold up an exam and smile . I want to hear Mimi sing her last , bedridden aria . <p> Eric stands his ground . He puts his hands behind his back and dips his head , like a butler awaiting further instructions . We both look at his feet , which are bare , in defiance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I look at the vents in the knees of his trousers . All of the Gudmundsson boys go around half in tatters . " I do n't sew , " their mother , Liz , once said to me , as if it were a point of honor with her . " My husband ties a nice trout fly , but he would n't stoop to sewing on a button . " <p> Eric 's candy-scented mouth hangs open a little . The inside is a shade of blue not found in nature . I feel myself giving way . I ask if he wants something to eat . <p> He says " OK " and follows me into the kitchen . I ask if Louis is still at his house . <p> " He and Tim are playing , " Eric says . Tim is the middle Gudmundsson boy , a secondgrader , a year ahead of Eric and Louis . " They ditched me . " <p> " I 'm sorry . It 's hard for three friends to play together , is n't it ? " However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow in Mrs. Lauterbach 's yard a couple of days ago , making intricate designs . <p> " Tim 's a big jerk . I 'm going to cut his wiener off with my dad 's knife . " Eric tries to stare me down , then pretends to study a coffee stain on the counter . <p> " I bet it wo n't be long before you and Tim are friends again , " I say , giving Eric two juice-sweetened cookies that my husband , who has taken to minding his calories , purchased . <p> Neither my prediction nor the cookies seem to lighten Eric 's mood . I say , finally , " Well , let 's go see what your father 's fish look like . " Act IV of La Boheme will have to wait . <p> I go into the back hall to get my coat , a black , quilted , ankle-length thing that I bought in New York when I was pregnant with Louis . It 's a bit grungy , having gone through three New York winters and four Wisconsin ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it a season 's worth of flotsam : ATM slips , candy wrappers , something I clipped from La Repubblica , yellow Post-its , a piece of a carrot that has gone all soft and rubbery . The carrot does n't surprise me , but a note on one of the Post-its gives me a start . It says , " Wassup , sweet docta ? When we gon na burn down da casa , tu ed io ? " ( Is the note supposed to go with the carrot ? ) The handwriting is unfamiliar to me , but the mix of Italian and MTV English suggests the note is from one of the males in my Corso Intensivo . I think of their faces at 8 : 00 A. M . , glazed and uneager , little gold rings decorating their ears and noses and eyebrows , and then I feel something ripple through me , a pulpy thought : I 'm desired by somebody twenty years my junior . <p> I empty the contents of my coat pockets into the garbage pail-all but the mystery Post-it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I see him pattering across the unthawed lawn . He starts to windmill his arms , as if he 's about to take a flying leap . <p> I knot my scarf and go outside . Eric shoots down the street , into a breeze from the northwest that has a whiff of cow pasture in it . I do n't see anybody else , except for Tom Heckman , who is on a ladder , inspecting the scallop trim he put on his new twocar garage . Tom , a retired professor of soil science , built the garage last spring and summer , mostly during the evening hours . He rigged up floodlights to illuminate his work . One August night , when Peter and I were in bed and Tom was pounding nails , Peter got up and yelled out the window , " We 're trying to sleep here , Tom , you moron . " Actually , neither of us was trying to sleep . We were reading , hunkered down in our pools of lamplight . His and Her pools . Seeing Peter at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous knowledge of stirred me . ( As a rule , he wore boxers . ) When he returned to bed , I stuck my hand inside his underwear . With our neighbor providing percussive accompaniment , we had sex . <p> I walk down the street toward the Gudmundssons ' , heckled by barrel-chested crows who have staked out garbage that has escaped from the Lauterbachs ' can . Eric has disappeared into his house , a white frame in need of a coat of paint . The storm door , hanging by one hinge , flaps in the wind . Even before I mount the front steps , I hear music-something fast and brutal that Silas , the oldest Gudmundsson child , probably put on . Silas is on the verge of thirteen . He shares a room with an iguana , a snake , a lovebird from the jungles of Africa . When he ventures out into the world , he hides himself in hooded sweatshirts and oversized camouflage jackets and stocking caps . <p> I decide to go around to the kitchen door . I walk past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among last year 's stalks of sedum , and then around Dennis 's dented blue pickup to the fenced-in backyard . The fence is for Vukie , the Gudmundssons ' Irish terrier , who likes to wander . For the moment , Vukie sits next to the picnic table , watching Dennis clean fish . <p> As I lift the loop of baling wire that keeps the gate closed , man and dog look up at me simultaneously . It strikes me that Dennis , with his long face and scruffy beard , resembles Vukie . <p> " Welcome to the funny farm , " Dennis says . I assume he is referring to the music pouring out the back of the house through the open kitchen door-that and the voice ( Liz 's ) that 's not quite lost amid the grinding guitars and a girl vocalist screaming " Lick my legs , I 'm on fire . " <p> " Eric told me I had to come see your catch , " I say , watching Dennis slide a knife along the silvery-black back of a fish that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dennis has the forearms of a person who digs holes for hundred-pound root balls . He owns a landscaping and tree-trimming business . He is dressed as if he lives in a southerly planting zone-short-sleeved shirt unbuttoned to his sternum , bare feet . <p> " What kind is this ? " I ask . The knife pokes out near the anal fin and then edges toward the tail . <p> " Lake Michigan Coho . Caught it over by Sheboygan . Got a couple rainbows , too . " He invites me to look in the cooler on the bench . I open it and see three large fish with vapor trails of pink on their silvery sides . At the bottom is a Baggie full of milkypink roe . One of the trout was carrying a load . " Very nice , " I say . " Have you seen the boys-Tim and Louis ? " <p> " Ca n't say I have . " Dennis cuts the fillet away from the rest of the salmon and holds it in his palm , as if to assess its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fillet in a bucket of brine . " But I admit I have n't been looking . " <p> The music has been turned down a few notches , and I can hear Liz 's voice now , loud and clear . " Do n't you swear at me , Silas Gudmundsson , or I 'll put you and your stinking lizard down in the basement and lock the door . " Liz is a small woman , delicate-seeming at first glance , but her voice is big enough to turn heads a block away . Perhaps all the hours she spends looking quietly into people 's mouths-she 's a dental hygienist-makes her want to shout when she 's at home . <p> " I 'm trying to listen to my music , Mom , " Silas says , in a brittle voice . " Tim and Louis are annoying me . Jesus Christ on a stick . " <p> So , I think , Louis is inside , listening to someone demand that her legs be licked , subito . <p> " Silas just hit puberty , doing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other fillet away from the Coho 's rib cage . <p> " Well , it had to happen sometime . Is he still interested in nature , his animals and all of that ? " <p> " You 'd have to ask him , " Dennis says . I see something flicker along his cheekbone . Then it skitters away , like a mouse through a hole . <p> In my pocket , I feel the sticky-backed Post-it that bears the proposition from one of my students . Which one ? Ed , the red-haired boy with the nose ring ? Aaron , the black-haired boy with the nose ring ? <p> Dennis takes one of the rainbows out of the cooler and lays it on the table . The house has become quiet . The music has been turned off . I look up and see Liz out on the second-floor mini-deck-a rickety little platform , inadequately railed in . She is wearing a silky , black , knee-length bathrobe and black slippers . Liz is the non-conformist in the family , the only one , anyway , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Claire , " she says , though it is n't me she has stepped outside to speak to . " You here for Louis ? " <p> " Only if he 's a bother . " The truth is , I would n't mind getting a glimpse of him before I leave . <p> " Three 's a crowd , four 's a riot , " Liz says . " I 'd invite you in , except first I need Dennis to help me wash out Silas 's mouth . " <p> Dennis does n't look up from his filleting . <p> " Dennis ? " Liz stands with her hands on her hips . Bare-legged under her robe , her blonde hair wet and untidy , she looks like a gal doing her best to look tough . <p> " Be with you in a minute , " Dennis says . He glances my way . " You like some fish for dinner ? I was thinking of smoking these guys , but I could give you a fillet now , if you want . " <p> I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blond boy appears in the doorway behind Liz . Silas 's blondness outshines his mother 's and his brothers ' . You can almost see him vibrating up there , trying to get a grip on whatever is beneath all that blondness . <p> " If you tell Dad , " Silas says plainly , " I 'll tell him about you . " Liz turns to look at Silas , but says nothing . When he bolts into the house , she follows , calling his name . <p> " Looks like things are going to hell around here , " Dennis says . He wraps a fillet in newspaper and hands it to me . A door slams . Dennis rises from the picnic table . His shirt hangs out of his jeans . There is something silvery scattered in the thickets of his beard . Fish scales ? Does he know what Silas knows about Liz ? What does Silas know ? Dennis 's eyes , soft brown but half-curtained , do n't clarify anything . <p> " Maybe I should fetch Louis for you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigtime . " <p> I walk around to the front to wait for Louis . I lean against the rear of Dennis 's truck and , for no reason that I know of , recall standing at the Information Booth in Grand Central Terminal , with Louis , who was then six months old , strapped to my back . We were waiting for Peter , who was coming from his office on Forty-third Street . ( He worked for an in-flight magazine ; a few months later , he quit to become a househusband , a career he still pursues , more or less , while keeping an eye on the stock portfolio he inherited from his grandfather . ) We were going to take the train out to Westchester and look at a house that was for rent . As Louis and I waited , we watched the airfoillike tabs on the Arrivals &; Departures board spin . An express , then a local , left without us . A man with a green scarf tied around his head like a babushka stood before us with his palm out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruination . I gave him money and moved away . At last , I saw Peter descending the Vanderbilt Avenue stairs , fortyfive minutes late . He was wearing a plaid hunting cap , the kind Holden Caulfield wore , and a carcoat , now quite ratty , which had once belonged to his grandfather . There was something forlorn about Peter then , some sadness that was almost adolescent in the intensity of its expression , which may have accounted for his tendency to run late . But he brightened when he saw Louis , whom he 'd brought a gift , a frog puppet with a long , red tongue that shot from the mouth like a light beam . <p> Silas Gudmundsson pops out the front door as if propelled . I say " Hi , " but he ignores me , a lady standing out in the cold with a slab of fish , and runs down the street in the direction of the railroad tracks and the strip mall beyond . I listen for voices from the house-the inner door , as well as the storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the steps and peer in . There 's an overturned basket of laundry in the hall . I call Louis 's name twice . " Time to come home , honey . " Silas 's lovebird chirps in a far corner of the house . Then I see Dennis coming down the stairs-his naked , veiny feet , his grubby jeans , the billow of his stomach that pushes against his disheveled shirt . He stops before he reaches the bottom . <p> " The boys went out the back , " he says , gripping the banister . Even in the dim light of the hallway , I can see that he is rattled , something pulsing under the skin above his beard . <p> " OK , " I say . " Thanks for the fish . " <p> " You bet . " <p> I 'm drilling a hole in the floor of the side porch . It 's here , next to the kitchen door , that I 'm going to affix the boot scraper that Peter gave me for my birthday last week . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all stiff black bristles except for its snout . Peter ordered it from a catalog . It 's a nice boot scraper , as boot scrapers go , but I think I would 've preferred a book or some racy underwear . <p> As I screw the hedgehog 's wooden base into the floor , Peter lies in the hammock , reading . It is mid-May , two weeks past the last frost . The lilacs that grow near the porch are close to blooming , and there are flowers on the sweet woodruff in the border . In celebration , I 'm as barefooted as a Gudmundsson , two of whom are in the house with Louis , making savage noises . School is out-for me , anyway . ( The children have a couple more weeks . ) All I have to do is turn in my grades . I 'm giving a B to the boy who slipped me the hip-hop mash note . This may be one grade below what he actually deserves , since he aced the final ; only the past-perfect subjunctive tripped him up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in those he did attend he observed near absolute silence . His name is Adrian . I saw him once outside class , in a College Avenue pub where I go to play pinball . ( I love the way the balls rocket up the chute into that carnival world with its corny flashing lights and thumper-bumpers and pop-up targets . ) He leaned on the machine , an old-fashioned Bally , momentarily obstructing my view of the ricocheting ball . He was handsome , almost pretty , even with the two-day-old stubble on his face , even with the rather frightful Moe of the Three Stooges haircut . He had a ripe , fleshy , just-shy-of-corrupt mouth , like one of Caravaggio 's boy models . I knew without asking that he was the author of the note . <p> After I have secured the boot scraper to the floor , I notice that the door , when opened by a hurrying child , will strike the hedgehog 's snout about halfway through its arc . I can move the scraper now , or I can go inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I go inside and drink a Coke while standing at the kitchen sink , from where I can see Peter , or some of him . What I can mostly see are his hands , which hold a book above the edges of the hammock . He has nice hands-small , delicate , feminine , despite the cicatrix at the base of his left thumb . He does n't do much in the way of manual labor . He is n't any good at fixing or tinkering or building , all those nuts-and-bolts things that men do because their fathers taught them how to . But when I married Peter , I knew I was n't getting somebody who could repair a leaky tap . ( I 'm able to replace a washer myself . ) So what does my husband do with his hands ? He prunes the lilacs after they bloom , and in the fall he rakes leaves , raising a blister or two . He swabs the bathroom now and then . He punches in numbers on his calculator . Every so often he goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Host that the minister lays in his palm . He shows Louis how to hold a split-finger fastball . In the days before Louis , Peter would sometimes sneak up from behind and put his hands on me . And then we would put our smoky mouths on each other . But neither of us smokes anymore . <p> And of course his hands grip books-huge biographies , huge novels , books he failed to crack while loafing through college . He disappears into books , like a boy into a cave . <p> Out in the living room , Louis and the Gudmundsson boys are discussing anatomy . Their voices are low and conspiratorial . <p> " Your mom has a ditch , " says Tim , who has seniority in this group , " and your dad has a bike . Sometimes your dad rides his bike into your mom 's ditch . Silas told me . " <p> " My mom has a puntchina , " Eric says , with authority . <p> " My dad has a willie , " Louis says . <p> " Boys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why do n't you go outside and play ? The sun is shining . " <p> Louis and Eric fly off , like birds flushed from a bush . Tim , oddly , remains , his eyes on me . Tim is an uneasy child , rabbity around the mouth , watchful . He is prone to colds and funks . He is heavier than Eric , built like his father . <p> " Everything all right , Tim ? " I know there is trouble at the Gudmundssons , though the extent of it is unclear . For a while , it seemed that Liz was having an affair . Then , it seemed that the affair had ended . Or so I thought after seeing the whole family drive off one sunny Saturday with a canoe strapped to the top of the van . Now I hear that Liz has gone away . She told her children that she was going to visit her sister in Colorado . According to my neighbor , who keeps her eyes peeled for rents in the fabric of family life in our little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a carpenter named Garvin . <p> " My foot 's asleep , " Tim says . He is sitting with his feet under his rump . <p> " Whenever my foot falls asleep , " I say , " I tickle it with the turkey feather I keep in my hair . " I have the kind of hair-dark , curly , flighty-in which you could hide a turkey feather . Tim looks at me as if I might be a witch , then manages to get his bare feet moving . " I have to go see if my dad 's home , " he says . " He went to look for Vukie . " <p> " Vukie 's missing ? " <p> Tim does n't answer . He hurries out the door and trots down the street toward his house , which on this particular Saturday , in the gauzy spring light , looks abandoned . I scout the block for Eric and Louis . I see Tom Heckman puttering around in his cathedral of a garage , to the accompaniment of heroic music-Beethoven , I think . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I walk toward the grove of firs at the end of the block , where the boys sometimes play . I find no children , only a cairn constructed of pine cones and sticks . <p> I walk back to the Gudmundssons ' and open the storm door . ( It has been rehinged , but now the glass panel is missing . ) I knock on the inner door and then push it open . I hear what sounds like someone moaning during sexual climax . " Hello ? " I say . The moans fade . <p> I enter the house and walk into the kitchen . Sunlight pours through the window above the sink , shining on breakfast litter , a pizza box , an open jar of Skippy . I call out a succession of boy 's names . <p> I hear what sounds like a fart , and track it to the TV room , where Silas sits on the couch . He is wearing a black stocking cap pulled down to the bridge of his nose . No shirt . The iguana squats on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belly . The lovebird perches on the back of the sofa ; its face and throat are peach-colored , its chest a comely shade of green . Silas has the TV remote in his hand . He has clicked off whatever he was watching . <p> " I thought I saw Tim come in , " I say . " I thought Louis and Eric might be here . " Silas makes me more nervous than a thirteen-year-old boy in a stocking cap should . I scan the room for his pet snake , an obscure northwoods species . Louis has told me the snake is shy but friendly . <p> " They 're not here , " Silas says , barely moving his mouth . The lovebird flies off the sofa , causing the air to quiver , and then settles on the La-Z-Boy in the corner . <p> " When 's your mother coming back ? From Colorado , I mean ? " <p> " Maybe when she gets tired of her boyfriend 's dick , " he replies . " How should I know ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say . <p> " Who are you ? " Silas says . " My guidance counselor ? " He points the remote at the TV-my cue to depart . I go out through the kitchen , taking the pizza box with me after failing to fit it into the overflowing can under the sink . At home , I find nobody , not even Cassius . There is a note on the kitchen counter : " Gone to take another look for my bike . Boys are at the school playground . " This is something else that Peter does with his hands : leaves me messages in small , slanting script that makes me think of people walking into high winds , leaning forward so as not to be blown backward . <p> Early one morning in July , I am weeding the garden when Peter appears at my side and says without preamble that he has been seeing this person named Jamie . This strikes me as an odd locution-this person named Jamie-and for a moment I wonder if Jamie is a man . I 've seen gay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a prospect . I think the sex might appeal to him , but I doubt that much else about gay life would . And probably the locution is simply a sign of nervousness . His hands are in the pockets of his shorts . His eyes are behind sunglasses-prescription sunglasses , though the prescription is long out of date . <p> A moment later , he clears up my confusion by saying that he is going to drive out West with her tomorrow . " I 'll be back in two weeks and then we 'll figure out where to go from there . " <p> " Oh " is all I manage to say . I 'm on my knees in the dirt and cocoa mulch , a forked weed-extractor in my hand . In order to fully see Peter , who is standing with the sun at his back , I have to turn and look over my shoulder . I am aware of a rushing sound in my head , like the sound you hear when you put your ear to a conch . <p> Peter 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mosquito sucking at my cheek and another one on my forearm . The spikelets on the veronica seem too purple to be real . <p> " What about Louis ? " I ask . " Are you going to wreck his life so you can satisfy some need you have for I do n't know what ? A better blow job ? Cannonball tits ? " I could name other things he might want-praise for his scribblings , for instance : have I said that in addition to being a househusband , he 's a writer of sorts ? - but things of the flesh seem appropriate in the circumstances . <p> " I 'm not going to wreck his life . " A hand emerges from his pocket and moves toward me . " You have a mosquito on your cheek . " <p> " I 'm aware of that , " I say . Four mornings later , I 'm taking the garbage out to the curb when Dennis pulls up in his truck . He has shaved off his beard . From twenty paces , where I 've halted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " How you getting along ? " he asks , more cheer in his voice than I expect from a man whose wife has moved out on him , leaving him to mind three boys . <p> " Fine . " Inside the can , along with the week 's debris , is the hedgehog boot scraper , that ponderous symbol of my husband 's infidelity , which I twice screwed into the porch floor and then unscrewed in a mindless fury . Is n't it the hedgehog that 's supposed to know one thing deeply ? One thing I know is that a hedgehog boot scraper makes me want to throw things . <p> " I was wondering if you and Pete and Louis want to come over for a cookout tonight . I 'm going to grill some venison burgers . " <p> " Peter 's out of town , " I say . The story he told Louis was that he was going to New Mexico to visit a college friend who has Hodgkin 's . Louis carried one of his father 's suitcases out to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastic Army canteen , in case Peter got stuck in the desert . <p> " We 'd be happy to have you and Louis , " Dennis says . " You like venison ? " <p> " Yeah , sure . " This is n't quite accurate . " Seven OK ) ? " <p> " Yeah , sure . " I press down on the lid of the garbage can ; it 's not secure . " Nice robe , " he says , and puts his truck in gear . The robe , which is sateen , has a flower-and-fruit motif . I bought it this spring . <p> " Thanks . " I do n't say anything about his clean cheeks . I 'm not up to trading compliments with a man in a truck at six-thirty in the morning . <p> Around noon , Louis and I pedal our bicycles to the lake . Louis leads , shouting " Avanti ! Avanti ! " In my basket , I have his fishing pole and the worms he dug out of the garden . In my backpack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little Italian flag taped to the handlebars of Louis 's bike flaps in the breeze he stirs up . He 's a gonfalonier for a party of two . <p> It 's a hot day , the air so thick and humid that I feel I 'm tunneling through it . We take a trail that runs along a finger of wooded land that juts into the lake , and stop at a swimming beach halfway out . The beach looks southeast across the lake , toward campus-the old stone boathouse , the tile-roofed dorms among the burr oaks . Poking up above everything is a red-brick campanile , which clever undergraduates ensheathe in a prophylactic every so often . <p> Louis fishes from a rock shaded by a clump of white birches . I lie back on my towel and read five pages of my mystery before putting it aside . I 'm sweating through my Tshirt . The leaves at the top of the birches are moving , flickering , but there is no breeze down here . I sit up with a desire for a cigarette . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortly before I became pregnant with Louis . The afternoon of the day I quit , I went to Central Park with a book and ate a gelato and then a hot dog and then blades of New York City grass , one by one . <p> I see a couple sharing a cigarette on the other side of the beach . He puts the cigarette in her mouth , then she , laughing , puts it in his mouth . His , I 'm afraid , is the ripe bocca of my ex-student Adrian . <p> I lie back down and shut my eyes . I remember Adrian leaning against the Bally , asking me the Italian word for pinball , telling me that if it was n't his last semester at school he 'd take more Italian . A ball shot past the flippers , and then I flubbed a rebound and another slipped down the run-out slot . I let him buy me a glass of wine . It was four in the afternoon and it was raining . I removed my wire-rimmed no-line bifocals and put them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Adrian 's mouth , which seemed to glisten in the subaqueous light of the bar . He told me he 'd been reading Calvino . " This dude I know told me about him , " he said . Adrian 's hand grazed my arm as he reached for a bowl of peanuts , and I thought for a moment that I 'd be willing to pay fifty dollars for a room at the Badger Motor Court , three blocks away , to have his mouth on mine . But I left , saying I had a department function to attend , and bicycled home , the cold late-April drizzle stinging my face , fogging my glasses . Was I really that close to sleeping with a boy half my age ? I could n't decide whether I felt virtuous or regretful for having resisted Adrian , but the rain got into my bones and brought on a fever that laid me low for several days . <p> " I need to go pee . " Louis is standing beside me , dangling the worm on his fishing line near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Get it out of my face , please . " There is an outhouse in the woods , on the other side of the beach . I can lead Louis past Adrian and his companion-the direct routeor we can circumnavigate them . We take the direct route . <p> " Buon , Giorno , I say . After the encounter in the College Avenue pub , I saw Adrian only in the classroom , and only irregularly . The absences were the reason he did n't get an A. <p> " Hey . " On his smooth chest , above his left nipple , is a tattoo , some sort of crested , long-tailed bird . Below the nipple is an inscription I ca n't make out . His girlfriend is tattoo-less , as far as I can tell . <p> " How 's life after college ? " I ask . I had him on the line for that moment , the thrill of it shooting up my arm , and then I let him go . Or he had me , I should say . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says " peen-ball , " as an Italian might , and grins . <p> Louis tugs at my hand . " Ciao , I say to Adrian . <p> Before we reach the outhouse , Louis stops and pulls down his bathing suit . " Can I get a Roadrunner tattoo like that man ? " He attempts to cast his pee widely . It patters on ferns . <p> " Maybe when you get to college . " I put my hand on his head and let it slide over the occipital ridge down to his soft , damp nape . He pulls up his swimsuit . " I kind of like your skin the way it is . " <p> He ignores me . He 's looking toward Adrian . " It 's so cool . It says Beep ! Beep ! ' right here . " He taps below his nipple . <p> Before trying one of Dennis 's venison burgers , I fortify myself with a half bottle of wine , which I 've brought along for the occasion . Dennis drinks a can of Squirt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sauce . " Hoping to slim down a little here , " he says , patting his stomach . " Got to make myself lean and mean for the divorce negotiations . " <p> " I thought divorce was no-fault in Wisconsin . " <p> " It is , but we still got a few kinks to work out , " Dennis says . " Custody arrangements , that sort of thing . " He touches his bare cheek , then his upper lip , as if in search of his missing beard . Close-up , Dennis looks a bit raw without his beard-youthful in the way an overgrown boy is youthful , and yet harder , too . <p> " Yeah , " he says , shifting in his lawn chair , setting an ankle on top of a knee . " Liz wants to blame me for the fact that she ran off with this carpenter with hair down to his ass . " Dennis makes a kind of pish sound , like a tire leaking . " This guy who looks like that Allman Brother , whatshisname , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> I do n't know what Peter 's girlfriend looks like . Not that I care greatly . It seems enough to know her name and occupation . ( I scored one of her business cards while snooping around Peter 's desk the day he left . ) She 's a clown/magician/balloon artist . ( The virgules are hers . ) She does kids ' birthday parties and the like . Louis has probably watched her turn balloons into dachshunds . I sip my wine and look at Dennis 's wagging foot . I want to ask him about the black nail on his big toe . What fell on it ? What did he bump into in the dead of night ? But Dennis wants to talk about Liz . <p> " You remember that day you were over here ? I 'd been fishing over at Sheboygan , I think . That was when I finally figured out Liz was seeing this guy . It 'd been going on for a while . Silas knew somehow . My thirteen-year-old son knew before I did . I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it must 've started the weekend I went up to Fond du Lac for that sturgeon-spearing deal . She shipped the kids out to my mom 's house , and then she and the carpenter had their fun . " <p> " Well . " I slap a mosquito on my leg and brush away the bloody remains . I 'm ready for another glass of wine , almost ready for Dennis 's venison . <p> " I sat in this shack on the ice and drank beer and watched through this hole for these big , ugly fish , " Dennis says . " Whenever I told Liz I was going fishing or hunting , she always said , Sure , be my guest , ' but what she meant was , Sure , be a bum and leave me with three children . ' " <p> He falls silent . I can see him chewing the inside of his mouth , trying to get his failures and Liz 's betrayal to add up , trying to make an equation out of it . <p> " Should we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure , sure , " Dennis says , rising from his chair all of a sudden , like he is scurrying up out of a dream . " Let 's do some cooking . " Vukie , who is on a leash attached to a clothesline , sits up , too , to watch . Dennis walks over to the grill and squirts several ounces of fire starter on the charcoal . And then , for good measure , he gives it another dousing . When he drops a match in , flames leap up , enlivening the dusk . " The magic of chemicals , " he says . <p> I go over to the picnic table and pour myself more wine . " What 's Pete doing in New Mexico ? " Dennis takes a hunk of ground venison out of butcher 's paper and shapes it into a patty . <p> " Visiting a friend , " I say . I do n't say that Peter left a message on the machine this afternoon , telling Louis that he 'd seen a herd of elk in the mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved him . I do n't say that I erased the message and gave Louis a paraphrase : his father had called to say hi . <p> Dennis looks at me sideways , as if he might have some inkling of my situation , as if there is something in my voice or posture that suggests a fellow-victim of a homewrecking . I stand up straighter . <p> " I went out West once , after college , " Dennis says . He does n't know . " I went with this girl , but she hopped off the wagon before we got too far . I camped out one night on the edge of a mesa in Utah . Got stoned , watched the sunset , and then just as I was closing my eyes , I heard this whoosh , like the air was being parted right above my nose . This happened four or five times . It was a big bird , an owl , probably , telling me to move , letting me know I was in its space . It was flying so close I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revved up for a night of hunting . " <p> " What 'd you do ? " <p> " I moved my sleeping bag , " Dennis says , setting the patty on a plate and grabbing another chunk of meat . " I 'm a little slow sometimes , but I 'm not dumb . " Even though he gives me a knowing grin , I still think he does n't know about me . <p> I take a handful of venison and shape it into a burger . The meat is dark brown , cool to the touch . <p> " I do most of the deer hunting in the family , but Liz got this one , " Dennis says , tossing meat from palm to palm . " She hit it with my truck one night last winter out on County P , coming home from my mother 's . Some farmer driving by helped her get it into the truck . A nice little doe . So we 're eating road kill tonight . Provided by my ex-wife . " He touches my arm in what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I 'll go get the fixings . " <p> Silas rides his bike through the gate and up to the picnic table . His stocking cap is pulled low , like a gangsta boy 's , but blond tendrils escape out the sides . He is wearing shorts that fall to his shins . He gazes at me as I bite into my burger . <p> " You going to join us , Silas ? " Dennis asks . <p> Silas does n't answer . To me he says , " You 're eating road kill , you know . " <p> I try to smile , but my mouth is full . Even though I 've dressed the burger with onion and relish , even though I 've drunk a good bit of wine , the taste of the deer occupies most of my brain . A doe leaping through some dark wood is in my mouth ; so is a doe straying out onto County P. <p> " I told her about it , " Dennis says . He calls to Eric , who is eating dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hey , Eric , how 's your Bambiburger ? " <p> " Good , " says Eric , who has put mayonnaise and ketchup on his . Louis and Tim are eating peanut butter sandwiches . <p> " Eric would eat a rat if you put it between buns , " Silas says , taking a handful of potato chips out of the bag on the table . <p> " Did you find your snake ? " I ask Silas . I learned from Louis today that the snake has gotten loose . <p> " No . " Silas 's blond eyebrows , just visible below the stocking cap , are faint brushstrokes ; his eyes are smoky-blue faraway things . " He got tired of hanging out with a bunch of losers . " <p> " Hey , " Dennis says , sharply . <p> Silas edges backward on his bike . It 's an old one-speed , a yard-saler-just a frame and two fat tires , though the handlebars are bent upward in a funky way . The bike is way too small for him , but some adolescent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong , if possible . <p> " How come Louis 's father is n't eating here ? " Silas 's question seems to be addressed to Dennis , but I answer it . <p> " He 's out of town . " Thirty minutes of light are left in the day . The first fireflies are out now , doing their glide-and-blink . <p> Silas makes a snorting sound . " How come I saw him with , like , this girl in the parking lot at Sentry ? " <p> " When was this , Silas ? " I can taste the impact of deer and truck now . I reach for more relish . <p> " I do n't know , " he says . " Sometime . He was feeling her up . " He snorts again . <p> " You must be mistaken , Silas . " Probably he saw something . Whether he has made up the details to taunt me hardly matters . <p> Dennis swings his legs out from under the picnic table , brushing my shin with his foot in the process . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a discussion . " <p> Silas , who has dismounted from his bike , holds it between himself and his father . <p> " Forget you , man . " <p> " Silas , " Dennis says softly but firmly , as if he were talking to a jumpy horse . From behind , in his T-shirt and basketball shorts , Dennis seems scarily large . He disappears into his bulk . Is this what Liz saw when he headed out the door into the wilds of Wisconsin ? <p> " Forget you , man . " Silas thrusts the bike toward Dennis and sprints toward the gate . Dennis catches the bike before it hits him , and then takes off after his son . <p> Some moments later , I 'm running , too . I 'm yelling at Louis and the two younger Gudmundsson boys , who have beaten me out the gate . I 'm yelling at Dennis , who is running under a full head of steam , who is going to reel in Silas in about five seconds . " Stop , you all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Even when I 'm not top-heavy with wine and not wearing pool sandals , I 'm slow on my feet . God gave me slender legs and the vanity that makes me take them to the natatorium three times a week , but He also gave me toes that turn inward and an effortful running style . Nevertheless , it 's not me who trips on the whirlybird sprinkler in Tom Heckman 's front yard . By the time Dennis pulls himself up out of Tom 's wet grass , Silas is halfway down the next block . " Silas , " he shouts , " I want you home now ! " <p> Silas keeps going , into the gathering dark . The sky will be clear tonight , I notice , lots of stars . <p> " Daddy , " Eric says . " What did Silas do ? " <p> " He made me lose my temper , " Dennis says , brushing clippings off his knees . " You boys go back home now . " <p> " Silas is a big jerk , " Tim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow him over to Tom Heckman 's young sugar maple , which they circle while gossiping . <p> Tom himself is in his garage , oblivious to the fact that there are five people on his lawn . He 's got his circular saw going . <p> " Are you OK " I ask . " Your toe-is it all right ? " <p> " My toe ? " Dennis glances at me , then looks down at his feet-big white things ropy with veins , half-submerged in Tom 's lush lawn . " Oh , that . It 's just a dead nail dying . I dropped a drawer on my foot when I was cleaning out some of Liz 's stuff . " He looks down the street , in the direction Silas has gone . " I was n't going to hurt him , you know . " I 'm not sure he has actually convinced himself of that yet , though perhaps it is more humiliation than anger that burns in his cheeks . " I love him , even if he is a little prick half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I ask . My head is pounding , I realize . <p> " I better take a raincheck , " he says . He looks over at Tom 's maple , which Eric is climbing . Tim and Louis are chanting that caveman 's rhyme about beans , the musical fruit . <p> " There was a while there when I thought I should leave the door for open for Liz , in case she wanted to come back , " Dennis says , shuffling his feet , doing a dance with himself . " For the kids , you know . So they would n't have to commute between me and the carpenter 's place . But things are screwed-up beyond repair now . I ca n't see her knocking on the door , and I ca n't see me keeping it open any longer . " <p> I look over at Louis , who continues to circle the tree with Tim , as if it held a secret . Eric is way out on a limb , tempting fate . The dark is still coming down-faster , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a few more minutes , the stars will be out , pinpricks in all that velvety vastness . I imagine sipping black coffee in the silence after I 've put Louis to bed , a silence that is contingent on Tom having put away his power tools . <p> " How about you ? " Dennis asks . " Are you going to be all right ? " He knows . <p> " Sure . " I have Louis . I 'll have him until he flees into the night , his head covered by a stocking cap pulled low . <p> I call to Louis . And after I thank Dennis for dinner , going so far as to touch him on the elbow , and after tall , bow-legged Tom Heckman , wearing protective goggles , comes out of his garage to tell Dennis about the snake he killed that afternoon in his breezeway , I take my son 's hand and lead him home and lock the door behind us . <p>               @ @ @ @ @ @
