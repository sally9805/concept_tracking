<p> Taking no notice of the gritty New England roadscape as he rockets toward Portsmouth in a Ford Aerostar van , Jerry Brown hunches over a lap-top computer and taps out messages to himself . <p> " World has changed , " types the former governor of California . <p> " Inertia of economic and political leadership . " <p> " Politicians have paved the way for the failure . " <p> " Insurgency . New national purpose . " <p> A couple of hours later , before a crowd at the University of New Hampshire in Durham , Brown distills these errant slogans into a sour burlesque of the American way of politics , a system that once raised him up , then beat him down and now propels him to the outer limits of alienation as he makes his third attempt on the presidency of the United States . <p> " So you take off your jacket , you get a film crew and you put the jacketon your back and you get a dog , " Brown tells his audience of about 200 students and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say "  --  he shouts at the top of his lungs  --  " ' I hate taxes ! I hate crime ! And I love the environment ! ' Okay ? And as soon as you do that  --  that 's in the commercial  --  then I show up at a meeting like this and I tell three or four jokes , get you laughing , say Bush has got five things wrong with him , give you a couple of examples , make a Quayle joke , then list four things I think you want and I 'm going to give you , and then get off the stage so I can go to my next fund-raiser , to get the money to buy the commercial of me walking along the beach with my dog , saying , ' I hate taxes ! ' " <p> With the practiced air of a man who has spent two decades as a professional politician  --  and not just because the room is overheated  --  Brown doffs his jacket and slings it smartly over his shoulder . He gets them laughing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives a couple of examples , outlines his hopeful vision of President Brown 's America and then leaves the stage  --  to warm applause  --  so he can get to his next campaign stop . <p> The contradictions suggested by Brown 's run for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination  --  and evoked by his remarkable past in and out of the political limelight  --  are so glaring , indeed so stupefying , that it seems almost beside the point to mention them . <p> His dark hair thinning and his sideburns whitening , his middle giving way to middle age , he seems at once deeply cynical and genuinely idealistic , a posturing opportunist who wants to help his fellow man . From certain angles he is starting to look like a California icon  --  i.e. his father and namesake , former governor Edmund Gerald " Pat " Brown , whose own career was cut short by a minor Hollywood actor . Jerry followed Pat to the statehouse in 1975  --  after that eight-year interruption by Ronald Reagan  --  on the backs of Big Labor , Big Money and , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never thought I was going to make it , " he said at his inaugural , a celebration graced by the chants of Buddhist choir , " but here I am . " <p> It has been nearly a decade since he withdrew from the field of battle to dabble in the law , head up a think tank and wander the world . He left Sacramento after losing his 1982 race for the U.S. Senate  --  to now-California Gov . Pete Wilson  --  having run for president in 1976 ( when he surprised everyone by winning six primaries ) and again in 1980 ( when he was expected to threaten Jimmy Carter , and won precisely none ) . He had served two terms as the state 's iconoclastic " Governor Moonbeam , " a nickname about which he now makes charming jokes . His career had become a case study in downward mobility . He was all of 43 . <p> Now Jerry Brown has reinvented himself  --  a procedure he has perfected over a lifetime of transformations  --  as the avenging angel of American politics , albeit garbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's televised debate , in which he relentlessly savaged his fellow Democratic contenders as tools of the rich and powerful , was his attempt " to be the sword of the people , " as he explained at a press conference the morning after . <p> What kind of sword ? In his stump speeches , Brown talks of rooting out " corrupt money " from the political process  --  " the forces of Mammon , " he darkly intones  --  while " cracking open " the " stranglehold " of elite special interests that foster " paralysis " and perpetuate the " wasteful " status quo ; of imposing term limits on elected officials who vote themselves pay raises " in the middle of the night " ; and of eradicating the culture of political consultants , with its " sound bites , " " spin doctors " and " pretty images . " He attacks Republicans and Democrats with equal zeal as members of a sinister " Incumbent Party . " <p> In a typically Brownian turn of phrase , he has called his effort " a more impersonal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by " the mullahs of the media , " as he likes to twit members of the Fourth Estate . Restricting his campaign to contributions of $ 100 or less , he describes himself as a " catalyst " for an " insurgent movement , " which  --  if his alchemy is successful  --  will boil over in anger and carry him to the White House . <p> The odds are heavily against it . Indeed , some have suggested that Brown 's populist candidacy is designed mainly to give him something to do . <p> " As opposed to not having something to do ? " Brown asks witheringly , as the highway hurtles by . Private to the point of mysterious , he relishes his status as the bona fide celebrity of the race , the much-chronicled former Jesuit seminarian who has studied Zen Buddhism , washed lepers for Mother Teresa and dated Linda Ronstadt , and who metamorphosed from one of the most popular politicians in California history  --  reelected in 1978 by a margin of more than a million votes  --  into one of the most reviled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accused me of not wanting to win , " he says . " Have you ever found anyone who says he just does it for the exercise ? Do you really think you 'd just as soon not win ? " Clearly he 's in the throes of one of his trademark Socratic monologues , which he honed during cabinet meetings in Sacramento that often lasted till 2 in the morning . " Do you think these other five people who are running are going to win ? Do you think they think they can win ? " <p> Mercifully , he decides to answer himself . <p> " I have no doubt that none of them are going to win , and I 'll bet you any amount of money on that , " he says . <p> None of them ? <p> " Correct . I have no doubt about that whatsoever  --  not even a small little scintilla of doubt . " <p> And why ? " Because of the obvious fact , " he declares , without elaboration . After an enigmatic silence , he decides to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mario Cuomo 's going to come in or whatever . From my experience , that 's not the way it 's going to turn out . So if they 're running around , they 're working pretty hard , they 're thinking , they 're doing , they 're raising money , they 're hauling their families all over the country ... . " Brown trails off and chuckles to himself . " It 's interesting the way these things get going  --  how people may delude themselves . " <p> Pushing the Rock Brown reentered politics in March 1989 , after six years away , as chairman of the California Democratic Party , having campaigned on a platform of registering " millions and millions " of disenfranchised voters and revitalizing a party structure that was little more than a shell . It was a refreshingly modest job for an ex-governor , particularly one with a reputation for arrogance , but skeptics questioned how someone who had so pointedly ignored his party in the past could suddenly cast himself as its savior . <p> By all accounts , Brown toiled diligently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telemarketing operation and organized several fund-raising dinners  --  including one honoring Cuomo  --  by personally phoning hundreds of former campaign contributors to plead with them to buy up tables . <p> " I had to use all the clout and contacts and persuasive power that I had , " Brown says . " When you call a dinner honoring the governor of New York , nobody comes . You have to make it happen . You have to push the rock up the hill . ... You have to call people 10 times to create an atmosphere of excitement and crisis and necessity . " <p> As recently as February , he was trying to open the pockets of corporate executives , special-interest political action committees and other traditional sources . But he was compelled to cancel his ambitious grass-roots registration drive in order to fight a state ballot initiative imposing term limits , and to pay his burgeoning staff . He abruptly resigned in March after 24 months , notwithstanding his promise to serve the full four years . <p> " He did invest in the long term and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building , " says a former associate . " But he did n't carry the plan through . It was like a freeway that 's half finished . " <p> " I left because it was no longer tenable , " Brown says , describing a dynamic in which he was caught between his best intentions and the demands of incumbent Democratic legislators , who wanted scarce resources diverted to individual races  --  not to mention the requirements of former San Francisco mayor Dianne Feinstein 's unsuccessful gubernatorial bid . " Because I 'd pledged to build the neighborhoods , the party , and to serve the incumbents . That 's a contradiction . It just does n't work . " <p> To make matters worse , Brown found himself desperate to meet the party 's overhead expenses , approaching $ 22,000 a week . " Well , I know how it was done before  --  Charles Keating , " he says . " That 's how you have 45 people on your payroll who are not wealthy people . These are kids that are out there working , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get that money . It 's an awful feeling . And I can understand what drove Alan Cranston , " he says , invoking California 's disgraced senior senator . " It was the exact same pressure . " <p> State party Vice Chairman Chuck Fuentes , who held the same post under Brown , theorizes that Brown draws upon this unhappy experience when he denounces the corruption of money . " Jerry became more and more a fund-raising machine , and the stress on him was absolutely apparent , " Fuentes says . " You could see it in his face . He gained some weight . He was carrying the party on his back , and it was taking a toll . " <p> In the wake of his resignation , Brown mulled over a second Senate bid  --  by most assessments , he would have been formidable  --  before jumping into the presidential fray in October to spread his mad-as-hell gospel . <p> " I believe it from the deepest part of my soul , " Brown insists . " This country is being ruined by what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message that seems to strike a chord , so far as it goes . The day after the debate , during which Brown twice rattled off his 800 number over the strenuous objections of moderator Tom Brokaw , his campaign tallied more than 5,000 phone calls and pledges of more than $ 150,000 . <p> " I 'm doing everything I possibly can to help , " says one of his most ardent supporters , Pat Brown , a still-active 86-year-old Los Angeles lawyer , who responds with a hearty " Thank you ! " to the suggestion that , unlike his son , he 's a traditional politician . The elder Brown adds : " I 've been a candidate on many occasions , and I 've had to raise a lot of money to run for governor in a great big state like this . The giving of campaign contributions has an influence on the decisions you make as governor . But I feel it 's a necessary part of our democratic system . I do n't think it has the corrupting influence that some of Jerry 's statements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me that he really believes what he 's saying , or that he 's had any experience that has led him to it , " says one of Jerry Brown 's former associates , speaking on condition of anonymity . " This is a guy who wakes up every morning and says , ' Who can I become today ? ' " <p> The Surly Pranksters <p> " The endless quest ! " Brown says in the van , making fun of a reporter 's attempts to get to the bottom of him . " It 's like five diagnostic tests , endless diagnostic tests . " <p> With varying degrees of patience and good humor , he has answered questions about his famously competitive relationship with his father ( " I do n't take it too seriously  --  our relationship is very good , " he says ) , his net worth ( he 's a millionaire , he says , on the strength of real estate and stock holdings ) and whether he 's having fun in the campaign thus far ( " ' Fun ' is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countenances an attempt to pry into the reason that , at 53 , he has never found Ms. Right . <p> " I do n't know , I ca n't give you an answer to that , " Brown says , with something approaching introspection . " It 's an interesting question . I ask it of myself . " <p> But all his friends , it 's suggested , say he 's a nice guy  --  not , his interlocutor is quick to add , that there 's a link between that and being married . <p> " But that was the link you made ! " Brown shouts , flashing a triumphant grin . " It was a complete , absolutely inextricable link that forms the basis of your interpretation ! " <p> Typically , Brown steers the conversation from the specific  --  namely him  --  to the general . " The fact is , there are more single people today than ever before , at least in the last 60 years , " he says . <p> " Nobody has to say to him , ' Have I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco businessman Mark McGuinness , a friend of Brown 's since childhood . " What 's the old expression ? They 're all over him like a cheap suit . " <p> McGuinness says that as his friend grows older , he has begun paying more attention to material comforts  --  not because he wants them for himself , but because other people expect it of him . Brown was celebrated in Sacramento for sleeping on a mattress in an apartment near the capitol , rather than occupying the governor 's mansion . <p> " I think he 's become a lot more sensitive to other people 's feelings , " McGuinness says . " I think it 's been brought to his attention , ' Gee , you said the wrong thing there , ' and as he grows older , he gets a lot more sensitive . He used to go through life being very focused on what he was doing , and nothing else . Sometimes that 's not a good idea for a politician . " Still , McGuinness adds , " he travels light . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Brown says . " I mean , I 'm not interested in doing a ' style ' story , okay ? I 'm doing this because my view is , this is an open campaign , and whatever you want to write , you can . " <p> If these protestations sound a little bit like Br'er Rabbit on the brier patch issue , it 's no thanks to Brown 's strategist without portfolio , the once-celebrated Democratic political consultant Patrick Caddell . <p> A week earlier , the mercurial Caddell had said over the phone from California , " I was very surprised to hear you say you have an interview with Jerry . It was my understanding that that 's not going to happen . " The establishment press , Caddell explained , " is ideologically committed " to snuffing out the Brown candidacy . " It would n't be just a risk , it would be suicide for Jerry to cooperate , " he added . " I 'm going to have to check into this , " he vowed , and then rang off . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He also listens to the ideas of former presidential speech writer Richard Goodwin , business tycoon Ross Perot and the elusive but omnipresent Jacques Barzhagi , a former French sailor with a shaved head , whom Brown met a dinner party in 1972 and brought to Sacramento as a special assistant . Barzhagi , who may be Brown 's closest friend and reportedly chooses his wardrobe , used to open cabinet meetings with questions such as : " How is the governor different from a shoemaker ? " But in a presidential campaign with only a dozen people on the payroll , Caddell seems to be first among equals . <p> " He 's got a good insight , he 's got a sense of the country and a very good sense of strategy , but he does n't have an official title in the campaign and he 's not paid , " Brown says of his chief adviser , whom he met when Caddell was President Carter 's pollster and writing dire memos warning that Brown " must be viewed as the single largest threat on the horizon within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flaws ? You bet he does , " Brown says . " Do you have flaws ? I do n't know what they are , but I bet if I spent enough time with you , I could identify some serious ones . " <p> Brown freely admits that Caddell was largely responsible for his announcement speech in Philadelphia  --  including a line that turned out to have been pirated from the lyrics of an Australian rock band  --  but bristles at the suggestion that his reliance on a famous message-manipulator is at odds with his role as the enemy of politics-as-usual . <p> " I guess it 's a contradiction for Caddell to criticize the process because he was part of it , " Brown says , mining his rich sarcastic vein . " Once you 're in the process , you are , by that fact , prevented from ever criticizing it in any fundamental way . That mind-set means no change . That 's death ! That 's sclerosis of the mind ! " <p> After further questions about Caddell , he becomes exasperated . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , closing off the subject . " My campaign is sufficient . I 'd like to pick your brain . I 'd like to pick a Caddell 's brain or a Herman Kahn 's . Or Walter Berns 's or Ken Kesey 's or any number of other people 's . " <p> The mention of Ken Kesey  --  he of Tom Wolfe 's " The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test "  --  evokes an image of the Brown campaign as a band of Surly Pranksters romping through the countryside . <p> " You want to hear my three-point plan to end laziness in grammar school ? " he says in Plymouth , dismissing a middle-aged woman who has asked what he 'll do about the declining dedication of teenagers . The audience rewards him with a laugh at her expense . <p> " Okay , good , " Brown says at the same event as a shaggy-haired plumber , who has just told him , " More power to you ! , " presses into his hand a multicolored lapel pin . The trinket , the plumber explains as Brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> The next day , Brown is still at it , repeating his 800 number over and over on a radio call-in show , urging people to sign up for his insurgent campaign at colleges in Durham and Manchester , and rebuking reporters and editors at the Portsmouth Herald when they ask how his fund-raising is going . <p> " What I 'm trying to do is to open up a stagnant political system , " he rages . " You should not judge it by your criteria of how much corrupt money do I have . ... When you think of a body , and put it in a grave , it corrupts itself and begins to turn , okay ? This democracy is turning . " <p> " Enchanting , " says Victoria Ogden , the Herald 's editor . <p> " Can you shake the ' Moonbeam ' ? " Ogden demands a moment later . " Are you perceived to be too flaky ? It still sticks , the label 's there , so what can you do about it ? " <p> " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile . " I 'm talking to you  --  and I do n't know how much success I 'm having . "
