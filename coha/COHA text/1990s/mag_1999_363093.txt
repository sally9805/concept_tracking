That first night they took away everything  --  my drugs , my booze , even my wallet , car keys and New Yorker magazine  --  and left me nothing but the " Big Book " of Alcoholics Anonymous and the promise ( or was it a warning ? ) that I was under medical supervision . I was shown to a cold hospital detox room with rubberized sheets . <P> When the lights were turned off , I was overwhelmed by the feeling that I 'd made a terrible mistake . So it was a relief the next morning when I was introduced to a strapping , 6-ft. , blond-haired , freckled , grinning , giddy fellow named Jay Moloney . He was an agent from Los Angeles , I was told . I was a writer . Our case manager seemed to believe these two professions gave us something in common . <P> Jay flipped the bag of laundry he was carrying onto his shoulder and shook my hand eagerly . He asked what I wrote , what part of L.A. I lived in . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me we were going to " rock this place . " Last Tuesday night , four years after we left that place , and following numerous other efforts to clean up , Jay was found hanging in his bathroom , an apparent suicide . <P> Nothing seemed more unlikely that morning we met . I had n't anticipated his sort of relentless good cheer on my first day in treatment . The center struck me as a cross between a mental hospital and a minimum-security prison . Yet Jay acted suspiciously happy to be there . I figured him a flake , one of those self-proclaimed talent agents who pass out business cards to aspiring actresses . <P> But as we became friends , I discovered that Jay was as golden as Hollywood golden boys get , a behind-the-scenes show-biz dealmaker with his hands on the levers of the starmaking machinery . One of the most successful agents in show business and a part owner of the powerful Creative Artists Agency , Jay represented Steven Spielberg , Martin Scorsese , Leonardo DiCaprio , Uma Thurman , David Letterman and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-founder Michael Ovitz and was already being touted , at 30 , as a future studio head . He dated models and actresses , drove a Ferrari , lived in a Hollywood Hills mansion stocked with Warhols , Stellas and Picassos . Before becoming addicted to cocaine , he had been living the kind of life many of us dream of . <P> I , on the other hand , was in rehab because I had n't yet really achieved any kind of life . My nascent marriage was showing signs of miscarrying . A contracted novel I had completed was about to be rejected . During the writing of that doomed book , I had taken to ingesting prolific amounts of narcotics . I did n't take these drugs  --  Vicodin , Percocet , Dilaudid , morphine sulfate , Talwin , Darvon , codeine , the occasional balloon of street heroin  --  to help me write ; I took them to make me feel better about how badly I was writing . <P> So Jay and I had something very simple in common : we had both done too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had become addicts . We had gone through dark seasons at the end of which someone  --  in his case his partners at CAA and in mine my wife  --  had given us an ultimatum : get clean or get out . And we ended up at this treatment center outside Portland , Ore .
