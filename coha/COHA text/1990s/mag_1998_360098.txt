Are you facing surgery in the next couple of days or weeks ? What you do beforehand , how you plan for it , even what you eat can help determine how quickly you recover . At a meeting of the American Society of Anesthesiologists last month , researchers reported that eating potatoes before an operation could theoretically lengthen the time anesthetic drugs remain in your body . While it 's too soon to conclude that you should avoid spuds altogether , there are plenty of other dos and don'ts to keep in mind . <P> At the top of the anesthesiologists ' list : give your doctors as much detail as you can about your medical history . Do n't just say you had a bad reaction to general anesthesia ; say whether you felt nauseated , went into shock or took 12 hours to wake up . ( No , I 'm not exaggerating ; some patients with an unusual genetic condition take that long to recover . ) You should also bring up any allergies you have , since some anesthetic drugs trigger cross-reactions  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A small but growing trend : preoperative visits to an anesthesiology clinic where doctors can check you out more completely . <P> Be sure to divulge all the drugs you 're taking , including over-the-counter medications and herbal remedies . " Lots of people take aspirin these days as a preventive for heart attack , " notes Dr. William Owens , president of the American Society of Anesthesiologists . " It 's so much a part of their daily routine that they do n't even think about it , but a single aspirin can prolong bleeding time significantly . " Dietary supplements like DHEA or androstenedione can also interfere with the muscle relaxants that anesthesiologists use to make surgery possible . <P> Now more than ever , you have to plan ahead for surgery . As recently as 15 years ago , most patients checked into the hospital the night before their operation and stayed at least a day or two to recover . Today more than 60% of all operations occur on an outpatient basis . Chances are good you 're going to be a bit groggy when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . " You should start a list of questions the minute you find out you need surgery and keep refining that list , " advises Jane Rothrock , professor of perioperative nursing at Delaware County Community College in Media , Pa . " What can you eat afterward , and how soon ? How much can you lift , in terms of pounds ? How should you care for the incision ? When can you have sex again ? " <P> Be realistic . You ca n't expect to get over major abdominal surgery while walking up- and downstairs to a second-floor bedroom . Nor can you drive yourself home after cataract surgery . <P> And there 's no point in being stoic about pain . Researchers now believe suffering only sensitizes the body to more suffering and prolongs your recovery period . So do n't hesitate to take your pain medicine . A growing number of hospitals are even giving pain-killers to patients before their surgery . Doing so seems to shorten hospital stays by as much as a couple of days . <P> And while you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your spiritual ones . Many patients find that praying with a minister , priest , rabbi or other counselor before or after an operation provides an extra measure of calm  --  and gives them a head start on the road to healing .
