Choosing the right boat for a specific type of fishing not only involves deciding on size and interior layout , but also determining which hull shape is best for you . Thanks to the great advances in hull designs over the past thirty years , the choice you make can affect not only riding comfort , but overall suitability to the task as well , and the larger the body of water , the more important having the right hull shape becomes . Within certain limits , I 'd rate hull shape as more important than boat size , which is why some 16-foot vessels can provide better rough-water riding comfort than some 18-footers . Deep V hulls ride far softer and handle big seas better than semi V shapes because they carry the V shape all the way to the transom . The amount of this V , measured in degrees of angle from the horizontal , is called deadrise . The greater the deadrise , the softer the ride  --  and also the more water the boat will draw . It also takes about 30 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) speed out of a deep V hull as compared to the flatness of the last third of the semi V 's hull . That means more expensive engine(s) , and lower gas mileage . A happy medium between riding comfort and hull efficiency is achieved with the modified deep V ( aka modified V ) , or its more recent version , the variable V or progressive V. My current skiff has a modified-V bottom with 14 degrees of deadrise at the transom , which allows an engine-up draft of 9 to 10 inches , depending on load , and still yields a comfortable ride in 2-foot seas . The original deep V carried the same deadrise at the transom quite a bit forward ( some as much as two-thirds the distance ) before the deadrise began to increase significantly . The newer versions begin that increase , ever so slightly in the beginning , from just forward of the transom . An excellent example of this is a new 20-footer from Grady-White Boats ( Dept . FS , P.O. Box 1527 , Greenville , N. C. 27835 , telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts with 18 degrees under the transom and progressively increases to almost 40 degrees at the stem . Four longitudinal strakes along the bottom provide the dynamic lift needed to maintain the right running attitude , thereby eliminating the tendency to plow . The result is a 40-mph boat with three adults , some heavy gear , and 80 gallons of gas aboard , and only a single 150 on the transom . So much for the thumb rule that deep V boats are slower ! Not long ago I tested two 18-footers of similar weight and dimensions , both powered with identical 150-hp outboards . One was a center-console rig with a modified deep V ; the other , a modified-V bass boat with a racing-style flat triangular pad under the transom . The center-console boat hit a top speed of 56 mph , while the bass boat screamed across the lake at 71 mph . The difference here is purely a matter of drag , which translates as wetted hull surface . The CC ran with two-thirds of its bottom in the water , while the bass boat sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet of surface . On flat water that 's no contest . But in a chop of a foot or more the CC can easily run away from the bass rig and hide , unless the occupants of the latter are willing to risk hard bruises and maybe some expensive dental work . That particular bass boat is a logical choice for a relatively calm lake , but if the going is likely to get sloppy , the CC  --  or any other hull that 's a modified or progressive V  --  has a very big edge . Hull designs come and go , but so far nothing has endured like the modified deep V except the oldest hull shape in the world , the flat bottom . You may remember the various forms of the cathedral hull ( aka tri-hull ) that began to appear in the late 1960s and early ' 70s . Its strongest assets were roominess and stability , while its weaknesses were a hard ride if the seas were high enough , wetness , and a somewhat slower speed for the same horsepower . With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hingham St. , Rockland , Mass. 02370 , telephone 617 871-1400 ) , which continued earnest R &D; on that hull form in an effort to keep it seriously competitive with the developing deep Vs , most of the rest fell by the wayside during the early 1980s . But if you have n't noticed lately , the larger Whalers are no longer tri-hulls . Over time , the center section of that hull was gradually enlarged while the two side sections were reduced until it evolved into essentially a modified V with reverse chines . But now a serious contender to the deep V 's stronghold looms on the horizon : the catamaran hull . I was first exposed to this design on a fishing craft in Australia in 1977 , and I was impressed with the way it handled rough water . The cat 's popularity has since spread to South Africa , where as a rule the seas are anything but gentle . And already several companies are building them in the U.S. Three that I know of include Talon Marine Co . ( Dept . FS , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 813 355-0710 ) , who offers a center-console 20-footer ; the Ocean Star 250 , a center-console 25 by O.S.S.I. Marine ( Dept . FS , 5916 Sandphill Rd. , Sarasota , Fla. 34234 , telephone 813 377-8600 ) ; and the Sea Cat 21 and 25 ( North American Fiberglass Corp , Dept . FS , P.O. Drawer H , Greenville , N. C. 27834 , telephone 919 758-9901 ) . The new designs that I have tested recently are amazingly dry in rough water . As the serious offshore powerboat racing crowd learned over twenty years ago , cat hulls are faster than deep Vs when weight and horsepower are the same . The biggest problem was that the early models did not ride well in rough seas , at least at the extreme speeds the racers worshiped . But , dedicated to squeezing the last mph out of any power/hull configuration , offshore raceboat builders persisted in the cat 's development , and just as in the early days of the deep V , we have those pioneers to thank for taking the lumps and bruises needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the most part , catamaran fishing craft are still undergoing serious development and have a bright future in many angling situations . While some of the earlier models did poorly when faced with big head seas , innovative hull configurations ( thanks to CAD-computer aided design ) and substantial increases in freeboard forward have improved that situation considerably . And nothing beats the cat 's stability at rest in a nasty beam sea , a factor any drift fisherman will appreciate immensely ; a severe deep V , by comparison , tends to snap-roll in those conditions . The so-called tunnel hull is somewhat like a squashed-down version of the catamaran hull . It 's not intended for long stretches of very rough water , but it is also faster for the same horsepower and its big advantage in the angling world is that the engine can be mounted far higher on the transom than normal , which allows the boat to jump quickly on plane in the barest inches of water . It 's a very popular design among the thin-water redfish and sea-trout crowd along the Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride and/or exceptional thin-water capability still may not be the deciding factor . Big fish in skinny water , like bonefish , permit , or tarpon on the Florida flats , redfish along the Gulf of Mexico and southeastern Atlantic coasts , striped bass in the New England shallows , or largemouth bass prowling a lake shoreline are typical of the many gamefish that are sensitive to noise . So even if a boat 's draft is shallow enough to get into the shallows , a hull that slaps or thumps is going to scare off fish . There 's already a trend toward " stealth " hulls , with slightly rounded chines that give up some dryness but do n't telegraph the boat 's presence before you 're close enough for an easy cast . Maverick Boat Co . ( Dept . FS , 3054 Industrial 31 St. , Ft . Pierce , Fla. 34946 , telephone 407 465-0631 ) has a new 16 called the Mirage that sports such a hull . How do you select the best hull shape for your type of fishing ? Start by analyzing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others who fish the same way . Spend a day or two aboard as many other boats as possible that fit the " right " profile , especially when the sea conditions are less than favorable . By all means , try before you buy ; make the dealer take you out for a serious test ride . And remember : all boats behave well when the seas are flat , so wait until you can navigate a nasty chop before you make your decision . <p>
