Mother calls two or three nights a week now , trying to make . me come see my father , who is dying of cancer in the hospital in Missouri . <p> " He asks for you , " she says . <p> " Come on . " <p> " Do n't you think he 's sorry for things ? " <p> " He 's never said so . " <p> " You were hard to handle . " <p> " I was a kid . " <p> I 'm in the kitchen , helping my wife , Sue , clean salad . She listens wearily to my end of the conversation . Last week , she took our kids to see my father . They were fascinated by his skull-hollow face , by the coiling IVs . <p> " You know I 'm going to keep bugging you , " Mother says . <p> Sue hangs up the phone for me while I gather the veggies on the cutting board . The kids are in the living room , shedding their coats and snow boots . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sue says , " you should go . " <p> " Do n't start . " Sue 's used to being my good angel . Not this time . <p> " My daddy used to hit me , too . " <p> " Your dad was a drunk . " I put down the knife . My hands are shaking . <p> " I 'll finish that , " Sue says . " Check the roast " <p> When I was a kid , I always wondered why my father hated me . All I knew was that he rarely spoke to me unless I had done something wrong , and then he would say , " Come here , stupid , " and knock me down , or grab me by the throat until I could n't breathe . Mother would tell him to stop , but never tried to stop him . She was afraid of him , even though he never hit her . When he got into one of his real rages , she would take my baby-sister and hide in the bedroom closet . Next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to the doctor . It was always a different doctor , because she did n't want anyone to have a record of how many fractures her " accident-prone " child had had . Once we drove forty miles to Joplin in search of a new doctor . She was crying the whole way , and the sound got on my nerves . By then , I never cried . It was only pain . It was normal . <p> By the time I started school , I had learned to avoid the man . Mother would give me supper early , before he got home from the mill , and I 'd go off to my room in the attic or the tree house in the backyard . When I could , I stayed over at my friends ' houses , though I was scared of their fathers , too . By junior high , I was hanging out , going to midnight wrestling down at the Shrine Mosque , smoking pot with older kids in the high weeds by the railroad tracks . At sixteen , I left home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set foot in my parents ' house , nor laid eyes on my father except at weddings and funerals . <p> After supper , we watch PBS , Sue sitting on the floor between my knees , the kids cradled under each of my arms . Clay asks why the woman on the show is fat , and Stephanie tells him scornfully that she 's having a baby . <p> " I saw fat ladies at the hospital , " Clay says . " Is Grandfather going to die ? " <p> " We do n't know , " Sue says . " He 's old . Now shhh . Look what the butler 's doing . " <p> " Your grandpa used to make me watch the war news , " I say . " He said it would make me tough . " <p> " Shush , Dad , " Stephanie whispers . " You 're ' sposed to listen toTV . " <p> In bed , Sue and I read magazines by the glow of our headboard lamps . Snow piles up outside the bay window . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mother ? " <p> " She 'll be all right . " <p> " She needs you there , you know . And not going might make the whole thing worse for you . " She touches me here , there , her small hands tender . I let the magazine slide from the bed , turn into her arms . She reaches to switch off the lights , and I take hold of her nightgown and draw it from her . <p> " Here , " she murmurs . " Do n't tear it . " <p> " Daddy used to hit me and dare me to cry , " I say . " I would n't do it . " <p> " You would n't , would you ? This is what you should do , Dave . Just go to the hospital and see him . You do n't have to talk about the past . " <p> Sue always says that seeing family is like getting a pelvic : you just look off into space and after a while it 's over . But she does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one does . <p> " You could get free of it , Dave . " <p> " I got free a long time ago . " <p> My sister , Adrienne , calls three times a year , Thanksgiving and Christmas and Easter . It 's none of those , but I 'm not surprised to pick up the phone the next morning and hear her voice . <p> " Davy ? " <p> " Adrienne . " <p> " How are Sue and the kids ? " <p> " Okay . " <p> " I 'm at the hospital in Springfield . The old man looks bad . " <p> " Okay . " <p> " Please come . For Mom . " <p> Straightforward . It throws me off . In our family , we circle and spar . " I 'll come to the funeral . " <p> " Oh , Davy . I know you hate him . But this is for Mom . " <p> " You ca n't ask this of me , Adrienne . " <p> " Look , I understand how you feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " I always hated the way he treated you . " <p> " Yeah ? First I heard of it . I used to wonder why he was so sweet on you . " <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> " You know what I mean . " <p> " You 're nuts , Davy . But that 's your business . I told Mom I 'd try . " The line is quiet for a minute . When I do n't speak , she says , " Do n't get too hard , bro . You 'll end up like Dad . " <p> " I 'm not like him . " She wants to talk some more , but I tell her I 've got to go . I do n't want to hear about Adrienne 's life . It has nothing to do with mine . <p> When I was a kid , I slept in the attic . To get to it , you went past my parents ' bedroom , then past Adrienne 's , to a little closet that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trapdoor in the ceiling you pushed up . I had my bed up there , and boxes for my clothes and toys . There had been a space heater , but it had a gas leak and Daddy took it out when I was six . After that , it was always cold in the winter , and I slept in my clothes , with the covers pulled up over my head . Some nights , I 'd wake up and stick my head out and stare at the barred moonlight on the wall , breathe frost out into the air . <p> My father kept tools and paint at the back of the attic under the eaves . I always knew when he 'd been there because he threw out my junk : jay feathers , fossils , old green pennies I 'd collected . I kept my drawings in his tree house . Daddy hated them worst of all . When I was ten he caught me drawing with Adrienne and a neighbor girl I liked . He crunched his boot down on my drawing hand . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at school . <p> " You sissy faggot , " my father said . " Get on outside and play . " <p> Adrienne laughed and wrote faggot across my drawing . <p> Sue 's work is her car , her ledgers , arguing with sales reps all day long . My work is a sun-flooded room with drafting tables , pens and brushes , a Macintosh . Carol is there early , pasting up pages at the light table , sipping at her first cup of coffee . <p> " Sue told me about your dad , " she says . <p> " What did she tell you ? " <p> " All of it . " <p> I stick down a layout with magic tape , check my pens , start inking the sketch of a top-hatted toff I did last night . I like work . Time goes by . <p> " Looks good " ' Carol brings me coffee . She looks pretty in her black skirt and pine-green sweater . I 've been noticing her a lot lately . Her clothes and hair , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where my cousin works , " Carol says . " You might want to look into it . Its good money . <p> " I applied there once . It 's run by this old guy . " <p> " So ? " <p> I put down my coffee , pick up my pen . " I do n't get along with old guys . Did Sue tell you about our party ? " <p> " Yeah . We had a good talk , you know ? " <p> " She likes you . " <p> " She 's a good friend . " She pushes back her hair , gives me one of her curious looks . " You do n't really have any men friends , do you , Dave ? " <p> " I do n't know . Not really . " <p> " Why ? " <p> I hate when people ask why . They say this word , they think they 're saying something . " Friends are people you can trust , " I say . <p> Driving home through slush , I keep thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who disdained chains or snow tires , and loved nothing better than to shovel and buck a stranded vehicle out of a ditch . Where we lived , the road ran uphill both ways , and when he heard the rising whir of tires that could get no traction , he would reach for his truck keys and tow chain . If I was around , I had to go with him and help push on the stuck cars while mudy ice caked my jeaned legs . <p> In the Ozarks , the January ice storms come down out of Tornado Alley and glaze the roads sheer as mirrors . Daddy would take me out with him on winter nights , to cut doughnuts in ice-sheet-ed parking lots . As he bore down on gas pedal and brake , sending the car skidding in ever-widening ovals , his face became a mask of blissful concentration . He liked to hurl the car head-on at storefronts , then wrench it sideways at the last second . I held on to the door handle , dizzy and filled with terror . <p> Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I kept falling on the ice . We stood in the open , and the only sound in the vast quiet was the northwest wind 's snarl and skirl . <p> " Listen to that , " my father said . " God 's got his knife out . " <p> For some crazy reason , I felt close to him for a second . " Why does it blow like that ? " <p> He shrugged . " Y is a crooked letter . " This was one of his sayings , his answer when anyone asked him why something was the way it was . <p> That night , we spun till after midnight , and Mother bitched when we got home . <p> " We ca n't afford to get a ticket , " she said . <p> Daddy slapped her on the ass , pushed her to the kitchen to fry him a steak . " There 's no law in a parking lot , " ' he said . <p> The night before our party , I make Sue go with me to a meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and then , but never for long . She has a lot of white chips . After they read the Steps and the Promises , they go around the room and say their names . I hold Sue 's hand under the table , and her nails dig into my palm . <p> " I 'm Susan , " she says when it 's her turn . She points to me . " This is Dave . He thinks I 'm an alcoholic . " <p> Nobody blinks an eye at this , and people start in telling their stories . There 's invisible energy in the room , but I do n't know what it is , where it comes from . Maybe it is n't really there . When they pass the basket , I slip in a dollar . Sue looks disgusted , shoves her chair back loudly , and walks to the bathroom . Everybody joins hands for the prayer , and I get that tight knot in my throat , the one other people say they get when they cry . <p> " . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who sin against us . And lead us not into temptation , but deliver us from evil  --  " <p> There . That 's where it always gets me . Deliver us from evil . I 'd like to like God . But where was he when I needed him ? <p> Friday night , we have people over . Come midnight , I 'm talking with Sue and Carol at the kitchen table . Sue still thinks I should go see my father . <p> " Do n't you think it would do him good to go ? " she asks Carol . <p> " I think Dave should do what he wants . " <p> " You would . " <p> Carol 's a subject changer . " When I was little I wanted to be a nurse , " she says , " so I could see guys with their pants down . What did you want to be ? " <p> " I never thought I 'd grow up , " I say . " I thought my father would kill me . " <p> " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figured someday he 'd put his thumb on that cord in my throat and just not let go . " <p> Sue tells how when she was a girl she would walk all over town with her dad on Sundays , trying to find where he 'd left the car the night before . I pour more gin . The party is getting hot . Somebody dances in her slip in the living room , cheered on by a ring of clapping hands . <p> " So who are all these people ? " Carol asks . <p> " Sue 's friends from college , " I say . " They all fucked each other way back when . " <p> " Asshole , " Sue says . " Why do you hate my friends ? " <p> Sue 's friends are good people , they really are , but it 's hard for me to like people who take for granted things I never had . I do n't mean just clothes and contact lenses , but someone to help them with their homework , someone to make them come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I could take them all , " I say . <p> Carol takes my hands in hers . " Do n't start any fights , okay ? " She saw me fight once . I put my fist in this guy 's face a few times , then he laid his face on the bar . <p> " He will if he wants to , " Sue says . When she 's tanked , she likes it when things get crazy . Too many times I 've had to take a hammer to some guy she led on . <p> Sue drifts off to empty ashtrays and gets caught up in the crowd . I pour more gin . <p> " She really wants you to see your dad , " Carol says . <p> " Sue did the big reconciliation thing with her folks . She thinks it 's what everybody needs . " <p> " What do you think ? " <p> More gin . Some goes in our glasses and some on Carol 's jeans . <p> Sue comes back . She 's very drunk . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . She pushes my hand away . <p> " You go there , " she says . " You go in the room , make a little small talk . Your mother would be so happy . Tell him , Carol . " <p> Carol 's tired of this . " why do n't we leave Dave alone about it , " she says . <p> Sue looks at her , looks at me . " You two , " she says . " why do n't you two just fuck and get it over with ? " <p> Carol lets go of my hand . <p> " I 'm sick of you always whispering . Always putting your hands on each other . " <p> " Excuse me , " Carol says , and starts for the bathroom . Behind her back , Sue grabs a beer bottle and starts to throw it . I lock her wrist and twist . The bottle shatters on the floor . Foam and glass spray Carol 's nylons . She looks at Sue with loathing and keeps going . <p> I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes . But she just looks down , blinking at the mess of beer froth and broken glass . <p> " Good job , tiger , " I say . " Have another drink . " <p> " Fuck you , you cold bastard . " <p> Out by the cars , I find Carol , backing her Isuzu over a curb and around a Porsche . <p> " Do n't start , " Carol says . " You ca n't make this all right . So do n't try . " <p> " I 'm sorry about Sue . I was real unprepared . She never acts jealous . " <p> " Uh-huh . Does she always drink so much ? " <p> " She 's an alcoholic . " <p> " That makes it okay , then ? Look , Dave , you and Sue do what you want . But do n't put me in the middle . I do n't play that game . " <p> I give this some thought . But by the time I 've got anything to say , she 's driving off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ca n't do at all . I sit in the kitchen and pour gin . Sue and her friends play a game in the living room , everyone saying I love you to everyone in all the tones of voices they can find . They whisper it , shout it , slur it ; they butcher it with foreign accents . They say it to the chairs , to the clocks , to the prints on the wall . <p> When I was little , everyone in Springfield still shopped down on the square . My father would drive round and round fill he found an empty meter , rather than use the municipal lot two blocks away . Sometimes we circled for twenty minutes . Then Mother and Adrienne would go into Heers to do her shopping , while Daddy loitered with his buddies at Harmon 's Barber Shop . I always wanted to go to Heers and ride the escalators , but Daddy took me with him to Harmon 's . <p> " He 's growing , " someone in the crowded shop would say . " Going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a fact , " Daddy said , chain-lighting a new Camel and rubbing the old butt out in sand . All the men in Harmon 's smoked ; the talk was baseball and football in season , civil rights in election years . Over the mirror was a stained banner that read HARMON 'S BARBER SHOP : BAPTIST , UNION , DEMOCRAT . <p> " How ' bout that Lou Brock ? " someone would say . <p> " He 's a fleet one , " Daddy answered . " He got the call of the wild ? And he cupped his hands together and made ape noises through a funnel of smoke . <p> There was an empty barber chair Harmon never had enough business to need , and Daddy liked to sit in it and spin around . I sat in the last red vinyl chair , by the narrow door to the john , and read the magazines Harmon enclosed in plastic folders , oversized copies of Life and Look . Every now and then , Daddy would suddenly slap the magazines out of my hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 're slow , kid , " Daddy would say . " They 'd skin you alive in Texas . " I never reached for the magazine until he looked away . <p> Daddy was from West Texas , and liked to brag it up . " Hey , Kroger , " someone would say , " what about Texas ? " <p> He always answered the same way : " Texas is the floor of Hell , " And then he laughed , but it was a laugh I knew . It held his hatred . <p> Sue 's in bed sick all the next day , like always after a party . I clean the place up , then take the kids to the library . In the reading room , a gas fire hisses sleepily in the hearth , and I sit in a big soft chair reading old New Yorkers . Christmas stories . Those bittersweet resolutions . Then the kids rush in and show me what they 've picked out , square tomes their arms can hardly fit around . I flip through one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Can you teach me how to draw that ? " Stephanie asks , <p> " Sure . " My pencil gets into my hand and starts to copy the bear in the margin . Stephanie makes me erase it . All the way home , she lectures me about taking care of the library 's books . <p> I 'm in the kitchen making spaghetti when I hear Sue throwing up in the bathroom . After a while , she stumbles in , clutching her robe around her . It 's getting dark outside . I make some hot tea . <p> " There 's a beer left in the fridge , " I say . " You want it ? " <p> " Jesus , Dave . " <p> I pop it and act like I 'm going to pour it on her . She bats at me with hands weak as water . <p> " Stop it , " she whines . " No more parties . " <p> " You always say that . " <p> " Did I do anything bad ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " You were okay . " <p> " You can tell me , baby . " <p> I used to wonder if she really blacks everything out , or if she just pretends . I still wonder . I take a deep breath . " I love you . " <p> " Rub my forehead . " <p> I knead the flushed skin above her closed eyes . " You going to go see your dad ? " she asks . <p> " You really think it will help ? " <p> " It 'll help your mother . " She starts to stir her tea with her finger , the way she does her drinks , but it 's too hot . " Your mom 's sweet . Remember the first time I met her ? " <p> " I remember . You got drunk . " <p> " She took such good care of me . " <p> " I heard what my father said about it later . He said , I 've been shot at by better women . " <p> Her frown tightens against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Dave ? " <p> I get up and stir spaghetti . <p> In fifth grade , I had a dry cough that would n't go away . My father hated it . " Cut that out , " he 'd say . " You ai n't sick . " He and Adrienne would cough when I did , mocking me . Sometimes , he came into my room and bounced me off the wall . Sometimes , he sent me outside so he would n't hear it . He liked to send me outside when it was cold . I tried hard to just clear my throat instead of coughing , and my throat got all dogged and raw and I drank lots of water . <p> When I joined the Army my chest x-ray showed scar tissue in my lungs . The doc said I must have had TB once long ago . <p> There 's a lot of new construction in Springfield . The roads to the mall are choked with small , shiny cars . But on the west side , where I grew up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I cruise the square , where the streets have been closed to make a downtown park . Senior citizens stroll past boxed shrubbery , avoiding the eyes of winos at the corners . The giant windows of the old department stores are empty and dark . Harmon 's Barber Shop is a Planned Parenthood . <p> Mother comes out on the porch when she sees my car . She 's gotten too skinny . I bend down so she can hug my neck . She 's exactly as tall as Sue , something I 've never noticed before . <p> " Long time , " I say . <p> " It 's good you 're back . " She takes me inside and gives me coffee , rattling on about what 's happened to neighbors I do n't remember . " The Walkers  --  well , he died , and she went to Arizona . " After a while , she starts on my father . First the medical jargon . Then the apologia . <p> " There 's a lot you do n't know . Bad things happened to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " I 've heard all this . All those sad immigrant days . " <p> " You never knew your daddy 's father , " she says . " He . . . was n't a good man . . . " <p> Mother goes on talking , but it 's like she 's speaking in tongues : I ca n't make out the words . For a minute , I wonder what 's wrong with her . Then I know it 's me . I go out on the porch to get away . <p> When something hurts , and you ca n't make it stop hurting , you want to know why it happens . But there comes a time when pain is bigger than any question . I do n't want to know who he was , what bent him . I want him to leave me alone . <p> After a while , Mother comes out , wiping her face with a Kleenex . " You 're a good son , " she says . <p> I want to hit her . <p> This house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faucet leaks , and the top of the stove is black with grease . I poke my head up through the trapdoor in the attic . Nothing there but old tools and rags . <p> In my parents ' room , the bed sags in the middle , and stacks of old clothes cover everything . Voices scratch from the scanner radio . <p> " That 's all he did these last two years , " Mother says , " was lay in bed and listen to the police calls . He left it on all night long . " <p> I call Sue . My finger feels funny cranking the dial of the old black phone . Sue is getting ready to go to the movies with her friend Liz . They always get together when I 'm out of town . <p> " Have you seen him ? " she asks . <p> " Not yet . . . Something happened that was double-weird . Mother was talking and I could n't make out what she said . " <p> " You 're stressed . " <p> I let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I try not to say it . But I do : <p> " Do n't get too drunk , honey . " <p> " I wo n't . " <p> " Is Liz driving ? " <p> " Uh-huh . " <p> " I can come home tonight . " <p> " Whatever you want . " <p> Mother understands that I want to go to the hospital by myself . She 's there most of the time , anyway . She 's falling asleep on the couch as I put on my tie . <p> In the bathroom , I run my hand over the cracked tile , the sagging basin . When I was growing up , I would never go in there if my father was in the house ; the very idea would throw me into a sweating panic . I 've got pieces of memory , though , of being in there with him when I was very small , taking my bath , and he 'd come in to urinate . He would run hot water over my head till I cried , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't remember anything . I remember the first part happening over and over , but not what happens next . When I was going to the shrink , she tried to make me remember that part . That was when I quit going to her . <p> St. John 's is a rambling castle of cement and stone , less grim and vast than my memory of it . They 've raised a new wing and leveled a block of tree-shaded houses for a parking lot . In the marbled lobby , families mingle and fret in low voices , and nurses flex their tired , white-coated shoulders . <p> Mother 's given me the number of my father 's room , but I do n't go there right away . I sit at a booth in the cafeteria for a long time , staring at the faded mural of the Last Supper that covers one wall . I drink a lot of coffee , paying for each cup . Then I go out and walk the halls . Orderlies push carts of dinner trays , and janitors pace behind their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left ajar , I glimpse a young woman , her breasts bare , sitting up among machines . I turn my head and walk a little faster . In Maternity , I watch new babies , their roars muffled by the glass wall , until the ward closes and a patient nun shoos us out . I find the door with my father 's number on it , but walk by . Visiting hours are over , and when someone glances at me , I try to look purposeful . There is no end of corridors here . I could walk forever . Like a kid playing hooky , I ride the elevators up and down . <p> Down one corridor , I find some wheelchairs , racked up against each other like shopping carts . I sit in one for a while , then push off slowly . It glides on the buffed floor much more smoothly than I would have thought , and when I reach back , the rims turn easily in my hands , the chair leaps forward . I roll past a sobbing couple , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I nod my thanks and he smiles encouragingly . <p> It 's easier , maybe , to be damaged in a way people can see . What would my childhood have been like if I 'd been crippled , if Daddy had hurt my spine one time when he knocked me down . Would he have built me a ramp ? Given me Adrienne 's bedroom ? Maybe if I could n't walk , he would 've felt I 'd been punished enough . <p> In a men 's room , I stare at my face in the mirror for a long time . It 's an ordinary face , but the eyes are blood-raw and afraid . He 's dying ; he ca n't hurt you now , I tell my shuddering heart . But my heart answers , He will find a way . For a minute , I press my fist against the mirror and think about putting it through , but there 's no point . The world is full of mirrors . Instead , I lay my cheek against the cold glass and close my eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> This was a game my father played . He called it Why . He would make me stand in front of him and he 'd ask me why I always looked so sad . <p> " Why so sad , boy ? " I would n't answer , and he slapped me . " Why do n't you cry ? " He slapped me with the other hand . It went on and on , the two questions and the rhythmic blows . <p> Once , when I was ten , I tried to fight him . He got hold of my throat and choked me till my fists relaxed , then dragged me out on the back porch . He made me drop my pants and shorts and then he whipped me with his belt . Across the alley , some neighbor girls were watching . I got teased about it at school all that year . <p> " Thought for sure you 'd cry then , " Daddy said as I slowly pulled up my pants . " You 're a tough little shit . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why do ya do it ? " It surprised us both that I spoke . My voice did n't sound like me . It sounded older . <p> " What , boy ? " <p> " Why , Daddy ? Why do ya hurt me ? " <p> " Y is a crooked letter , " my father said , and laughed . <p> Two in the morning . The tiled halls are still , the lights dimmer . Behind the station counter , a nurse sits reading , his broad back turned , and does n't look up as I slow-foot past . As a boy , I strove to become invisible , a wraith my father would not molest . Now here , at the heart of peril , I have achieved it . <p> The door is ajar . I slip through , quiet as a thief . A night light glows , and the dials on the machinery blink and crawl . In the shadows , under the oxygen tent , is a man who might as well be a stranger . The hair is gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath rasps like a burglar 's muffled file . <p> Light streams in behind me . The dying man 's eyes open , rove a little , and close .

" I had to see him . " <p> The nurse 's face softens , but he still has his job to do . " Okay . But you have to go down to the lounge now . At the end of the hall . " <p> He goes out . I stand with the doorknob in my hand , staring back at my father . Once , he was a giant , and had all power over me . But that 's been over for a long time , and it 's time I came to know it . <p> His breath rasps . One anorexic shank juts from under the sheet . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I do n't have to do it that way . He does n't know me . <p> Soon I 'm out of town , heading west on Highway 60 . Snow blows in the beams of my headlights . The night is a black wall , thronged with the wavering ghosts of all our fathers , all our sins , all the carnage we wreak in this world of fear and passion and then have to live with . I think of the woman I love , of the children we 've made together , of the fear that chokes me sometimes when I think of the ways I might someday hurt them . This , I think , is my father 's last blow against me , his final revenge ; and in the drone of the heater I hear his laughter . <p> A week later , the call comes in the middle of the night . Sue listens , murmurs , hangs up . I lie still in the darkness . <p> " He 's gone , " she says . <p> " I know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Okay . " <p> " Want to talk ? " <p> " No . " <p> After a while , I hear her slow , even breathing . Headlights outside push the shadows of our elms across the room . And then , slowly at first , my throat tightens , my eyes burn , my chest aches with something I have to get away from . It feels like my face is falling apart . It feels like fighting  --  but my fists tangle in the blankets , shatter glass across the dresser , pound at the plaster of a wall that wo n't give me a place to hide . Sue is behind me , holding my shoulders , telling me it 's okay to cry . <p> I pull away . But she hangs on . <p> <p> By G. TRAVIS REGIER <p> G.
