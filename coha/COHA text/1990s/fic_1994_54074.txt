In addition to the stories Esther has in our inventory ( including an upcoming cover story ) , she has several new novels on the stands . First is a fantasy trilogy from Ace Books , Majyk by Accident ( published in 1993 ) , Majyk by Hook or Crook , and Majyk by design . Atheneum has just published her hardcover young adult fantasy novel , The Wishing Season , and for fun , she is working on a Star Trek : Deep Space Nine novel , Warchild , which will appear in 1995 . <p> ALL RIGHT , SOME OF THE details are missing . Time has that effect on events . Where were you when you heard the report of the bullets fired from the knoll , the Book Depository , the next car back ( your choice ) ? Ah , yes , but what were you wearing ? What was the last meal you had eaten ? Who was the last person to call you on the telephone before those shots rang out in Dallas and what the hell did he want ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't give me a hard time . Just listen . Sometimes the details do n't matter . This could be one of those times . <p> What you need to know : There were two lovers . They loved each other to the point of despair because they knew they were going to have to die some day . Those are the breaks , and the breaks always nest down in the heart . Most lovers , brought to this realization , usually are satisfied to pass on their despair through conception , but these were very perceptive people , for lovers . They knew the child they begat and birthed would not be them . " Accept No Substitutes ! " They did not wish to live on through new life . They only wished to live . <p> What else might help you : This happened a long time ago . Where ? Maybe ancient Egypt , maybe Summer of the warring cities . I do n't know . I forget . I do n't care . Nobody told me . Remember what I told you about details . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really ought- to know that this did not happen so long ago that there were no gods yet . The gods were already thought of as needful . The gods were there . <p> What you need n't bother about : Names . Not of the lovers , not of the place where they loved , not of the gods who watched them , not of what games the gods played while they watched . Pretend the gods were throwing dice , if you feel the need to imagine them frivolously , casually occupied , one way or another . Pretend they were taking a coffee break from making and breaking worlds . That 's almost as much fun as dice , and you lose less money . They took their coffee black , two sugars , and the donuts never made them gain weight . <p> Whatever else the gods were doing , they were listening to prayers at the same time . So now you know how really old this story is , because the gods could listen to prayers without sticking a priest in their ears and turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayers . It was sort of like vegging out in front of MTV .. Sometimes you picked up on something pretty good . <p> What the gods heard : <p> No , wait . What only two of the gods heard : <p> ( The others were n't paying attention . A fight had broken out in one corner of whatever place was immaterial and paradisiacal enough for divine beings to park their posteriors while at the same time being omnipresent . But they were gods , and gods are also omniscient , so they could n't have not been paying attention . Wait . There 's a reason behind this . Not so hard to come up with as the one I give the kids when they ask why they 've got to die some day , or why good people get old and crazy-strange , or  --  Wait . I can justify this . I once voted for Reagan ; I can justify anything . ) <p> The reason only two of the gods heard was that the other gods were n't paying attention . They did n't need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being omniscient , but just because you know all about something does n't mean it 's going to hold your interest . The other gods heard and did n't give a damn . <p> There . <p> What the God of Sentiment and the God of Trickery heard : <p> " O Almighty Powers , we love each other dearly ! Let us live forever ! " <p> That was it . That was all . That was the prayer in its entirety . Concise , precise , to the point . It was a very good prayer . It does n't matter who made it up , but my money 's on the woman . It does n't matter whether one or both of the lovers offered it to the gods , or how often . Once is all it takes , if you can get the gods to put down those stupid dice and pay attention . <p> That night , because dreams are discreet and gods loathe media attention , the God of Sentiment appeared to the lovers in a dream . This is what the God of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart to grant your prayer . You shall live forever . There is only one thing you must do first  --  " <p> Then the god vanished . It was most upsetting . The lovers sat bolt upright in their bed , clinging even closer to one another . <p> " I dreamed  --  " <p> " So did I ! " <p> " Did you hear what  --  ? " <p> " It went unfinished . " <p> " Was it just a dream ? " <p> " If we sleep again , and dream the same again , and if the god completes instructing us in our task , I will believe it was true . " <p> So the lovers urged each other back to sleep in the sweetest way either knew how , and it came to pass  --  which is just a polite way of saying that the god deigned to get around to it  --  that they were again visited in their dreams . <p> The image of the God of Sentiment appeared and said , " Where was I ? " <p> The lovers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever . " They thought they were very smart to " forget " to mention that the god was about to lay down the price of immortality 's gift . <p> Never play smartass with the gods . They see all , they know all , they are all things and everywhere , but they still do n't understand knock-knock jokes and that makes them touchy . <p> " So I was , " came the reply . " But so I was also about to say that first there was one thing you must do . Or did you ' forget ' ? " <p> The lovers looked shamefaced . " Name it , O Holy Being , " they muttered , staring at their dream-toes . <p> " Many are the paths of immortality , " the image declared . " It is not how long you live forever as hove you live forever . Before I grant you your prayer , I would have you both depart from one another and search out over the whole earth to find the style of immortality that best suits your desires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever lies within your power . You did n't need to bother me about it . " <p> And they woke up . <p> " Well , " the woman said with a little sniff . " That was a waste of time and dreams . Depart from one another ? Hunh ! I do n't want to be separated from you . That was the whole point . " She threw her arms around her lover 's neck . <p> But the man gently undid the chains of flesh and blood and bone . " We 'd better get started , " he said , getting out of bed and dressing . <p> " You 're not going to leave me ? " It started as a command , but it turned into a question . The woman was disgusted to hear how helpless and whiny she made herself sound and she resolved to kick herself in the pants as soon as someone invented them . <p> The man finished dressing and gave her a kiss just as soon as he had his belt tied in a way that flattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beloved , be reasonable . When we have completed the god 's instructions we shall have all eternity together . What are a few days apart compared to that ? " And so he left her . <p> And so we leave them . <p> Twenty years later , there was a night like no other when the moon shone full and white through the pillars of a holy place . The woman sat with folded hands and bowed head at the feet of a god 's image . Her eyes watched the pattern of mooncast cloud shadows slip across the shining floor . Her own shadow she did not see . She held a very sharp stick in her hands , and a slab of wood overlaid with wax . <p> The man entered the moonlit place from the shadows behind the god 's image . His own shadow did not fall before him or behind him . He was naked . He no longer cared about things like belts . " Am I late ? " he asked , folding his wings as he settled down beside her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that long , " she said , but with a skill for twisting words that let him know she had so too been waiting long and she was going to make him feel sorry for it beginning now and stopping when she got around to it . <p> Damn , she was good . <p> The first thing she noticed was the wings . " There 's got to be a good story in this , " she said as she stroked their leathery surface . <p> " It is our path to immortality , " he said . " The path I have found for us . For many years I wandered the world , seeking the answer . In ruins older than time , from men and women outcast by all decent folk who fear the gods , in songs and chants and tales of history passed from the lips of one generation to the next , I burrowed like a mole away from the light of day for a single clue to the fiddle of eternal life . " <p> " Wait , wait , " the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on her slab of waxed wood . " Do n't speak so quickly . That part about the mole  --  not bad . ' Ruins older than time ' ? I like that . I do n't know what it means  --  how old is time , anyway ?  --  but no one else will know either , or else they wo n't care , and it sounds as if it ought to mean something wonderful . I 'll keep it . " <p> Her lover gave her the strangest look , his eyes glowing a foggy red . " What do you have there ? " he asked , pointing at the wooden slab with one livid finger . <p> " Our path to life eternal , " she replied , proud as a new mother who had finally managed to forget how much it hurt to squeeze something so big through something so little . <p> The man frowned , and his black wings sagged . " You , too , drink the blood of the living ? You , too , shun the light of the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a casing barely big enough for your body and your nights prowling for fresh prey ? You , too , have forfeited your very soul as the price of immortality ? " <p> The woman nodded . <p> " But if so  --  " The man 's eyes narrowed suspiciously "  --  where are your wings ? " <p> " Oh , I get around . " She shrugged . " I could tell you stories . The places I 've been , the horrors I 've created , the wars I 've caused , the heroes I 've made , the kings whose swords I 've broken  --  " <p> And she went on , enumerating all the marvels with which she had trafficked . There was no denying that her words had a fascinating quality . Her lover drew nearer , so that when he opened his mouth she could see that his two foremost dog-teeth were rather longer and more to the point than she remembered . An odd stain of darkest crimson shading to black had marred their previous whiteness , and there was a disquieting reek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she demanded . <p> " I do not eat , " he said . " I drain , I devour , I wring the last vital drop from my victims . What does their misery matter , so long as they feed my unnatural life ? " His wings lashed back with the resounding snap of sails caught in the storm 's blast as he seized her . " Oh , beloved , it is not the same for you ? " <p> She thought about it . " Mmmmmm ? " <p> " Ordinary humans  --  common people  --  we are no longer like they . " <p> " Mmmmm . " <p> " They exist to give us nourishment , we exist to fill their sorry dreams with hints of life everlasting . " <p> " Mmmhmmmm . " <p> His scarlet eyes sparkled . " Then it is true ! Although the god 's word parted us , even separately we have come to find the selfsame path to immortality ! It is a holy sign that we were meant to be together always . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this pays for all . " <p> " Oh yes ! " she cried , casting herself deeper into his arms . " And after all that solitary time , you 'll never know how wonderful it is for me to know I 've finally found a fellow-writer ! " <p> He thrust her clear of his winged embrace . " You mean you 're not a vampire ? " <p> From his plinth , through his image , the God of Trickery laughed . <p> Now this might be the place to end it , but there 's more . There has to be . Or do you think the First Writer would ever let anyone else get in the Last Word , even if it was just a laugh ? <p> " I know that voice ! " she cried , shaking a fist at the image . " I should have suspected all along . You 're not the one who came to us in our first dream . " <p> " No , " the image replied . " That was the God of Sentiment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer to your prayer too easily . Fortunately , he or she or it or sometimes they became distracted by something and they or he or it or The Ineffable Pronoun still has n't gotten back to you . You should thank me . At least I know how to pay attention . " The stone mouth of the image creaked and cracked and partially crumbled its way into a smile . <p> The vampire spread his wings and uttered an awful bellow , a blood chilling sound that was scarcely human . " For this treachery , I will make you pay ! " he cried . " I will hunt down every one of your worshippers and destroy them all . <p> The touch of my teeth will turn them into my kindred , creatures of darkness everlasting . Undead , we can not die ; undying , we do not fear any god . " <p> " Pooh , " said the image , and the sun rose , turning the vampire to dust . <p> The woman knelt to touch the ashes of her lover . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used one hand to gather up the dust that had once burned her in its fire and let the fine gray powder sift down to cover the newly melted wax on her smooth wooden tablet . <p> Only then did she begin to write . <p> " What are you doing ? " the image asked . <p> " Writing lies , " she replied . " That 's what I do . It took me years and years to get the knack , and more years than that to help common folk understand what I was doing . There were others before me who could make marks on clay or wax or stone that meant words , you know , but all their marks recorded were things the way they are  --  sums and surveys and the contents of storehouses and the dreary succession of dead kings . Mine do more . " <p> " Yours deceive , " the image said severely . " Trickery is my precinct . You ought to be ashamed of yourself . " <p> " Perhaps I would be , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people did n't keep feeding me for what I do . They seem to like my tricks much better than they like yours . " She smiled at the stone image . " I am their promise of forever . The tales I tell linger , the marks I make remain . " <p> " I will destroy them , marks and people too ! " <p> " You ca n't destroy them all . " <p> " Then I will destroy you . " <p> " Try it . I am only the first . You will have a plague of lesser tricksters scampering over this world before you know it , making their monkey-marks and jabbering their stories and juggling their lies long after I am gone . Serve you right . Do you know , O Omniscient One , if it 's done up skillfully enough , people more willingly believe one lie in pearls and purple than a host of naked truths ? Fear that , for all your power . " <p> She scribbled a few more characters , then set her stylus and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There , " she said , and with a sigh her own sustaining lies left her body and she , too , crumpled into dust . <p> The dust of lover and beloved filled the chasms that the woman had scrawled across the wax . The God of Trickery stepped out of his image , down from his plinth , and tried to make heads or tails out of the strange scratchings . <p> He could not . He lost his temper and tried to break the waxed tablet against the plinth of his image . Fragile wood and wax shattered the carved stone into a mound of gravel . The image teetered and tottered and hit the floor kerbingo ! <p> Or maybe just wham ! <p> The God of Trickery called all the other gods to come and help him with this puzzle . They came at once  --  the ones who were paying attention . He told them the tale and showed them the tablet . ( " You know , I thought I had some unfinished business around these parts , " the God of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any better than he . Some of them got quite snide about the whole affair . Names were called . Personal remarks were made . Several fist fights got started , and one match of kick-boxing . Then someone broke out the thunderbolts and locusts , someone else ( who should have known better ) cracked open a family-sized Box O ' Cataclysms , and for awhile it was anybody 's universe . <p> And when at last the gods departed  --  leaving behind them the mined image and the mined shrine and more than a few surviving mortals who decided to eat this week 's sacrifice themselves if the gods were going to behave like that , so there  --  the tablet was still intact beneath the rabble . <p> The gods did n't do as well . Stay tuned . <p> Years passed . Ages rolled along . Aeons played Dogpile-on-the-Tablet . It got late . The victims of the First Vampire who did n't die of his bite went on to become vampires in their own right . It was n't a bad way to make a living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The victims  --  I mean the happy happy , happy audience of the First Writer decided that they could make up pretty lies for profit too . It was n't a bad way to make a living , if you did n't mind  --  <p> What you suspected would happen : Someone finally unearthed the First Writer 's tablet , covered with the mingled dust of the lovers ' crumpled bodies . He took a deep breath and the mingled dust went right up his nose and the next thing you know , he was sneezing sonnets . <p> Uh-uh . <p> What you might like to have happen : The tablet was at last uncovered by a sensitive soul who had no trouble whatever translating what the First Writer had written thereon . The sentiments were so powerful and moving that the reader thereof was moved to tears . These fell on the mingled dust and the lovers were at once resurrected , restored , and reunited . Today she writes screenplays and he 's doing cool things with a zydeco band . <p> Mmmmmmmnope . <p> What you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ironic bent of mind , or a writer : The tablet stayed where it was for about a week . Then there was an earthquake . Then a dog came by and did something nasty on it . This fell on the mingled dust and the lovers were at once resurrected , restored , and reunited , except when they looked around they discovered that they were a little too reunited . Instead of coming back as two separate and distinct individuals , they 'd sprung back to life as only one person because if you mix dehydrated writer with instant vampire and dognasty you wind up with the First Critic . <p> Look , I 'm sorry if you did n't like what they wrote about your last book , okay ? <p> What did happen : I found the tablet . It was in my Aunt Valerie 's basement all the time . ( That woman never throws anything out . Who puts strings of pink , light-up piggies on their Christmas tree anyway ? ) I can tell you what it said . It was all about where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the straight dope on things cosmological . It had the Big Answers to the Big Questions : Where did it all come from ? How did it all get here ? How much is it all going to cost us ? What is the purpose of life ? Is there life after death ? How will it all end ? It left no navel stone unturned . <p> It was also clearly the work of human hands . You could tell . You could go on and on about Divine Inspiration whispering in the author 's ear till the sacred cows came home , but everyone would know you were just talking through your laurel wreath . Someone mortal wrote it . Someone like you . Someone like me . <p> Which meant only one thing : Someone could tell a really good story . Thrills , excitement , romance , conflict , sex , the Big Bang and the Bitsy Burp , sex , organic soup ' n ' sandwich on the primeval ocean floor , Adam , Eve , Lucy , sex , and a cast of gazillions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still just a good story . No proof it was real at all . The gods were pretty lies , made by humans , flawed like humans , ultimately toys in the hands of humans . Or writers . Everything the way it is and was and will be is all our fault . There 's no one else to blame . <p> Oh , you do n't believe me ? Fine . <p> What the real story was : Great was the envy of far-reaching Apollo when he beheld the pride of the young hero who passed through the midst of cheering crowds in the great chariot . " They give him worship better due to me , " he said , and crouched in the Book Depository window with his mighty bow and unfailing arrow . Meanwhile , on the grassy knoll , Siva-Lord-of-Destruction was running through a few quick dance steps , his many hands balancing the sword , the spear , the dart , and the lotus . And in the next car back , Loki was saying to the beast-headed Set , " You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give them bullets , " and Set was saying " Just make sure you get the calibers to match , that 's all . " <p> And that 's all . <p> <p> <p> By Esther M. Friesner <p> We continue our look at deities and myth with Esther M. Freisner 's " Two Lovers , Two Gods and a Fable . <p>
