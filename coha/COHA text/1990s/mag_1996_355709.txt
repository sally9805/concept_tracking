Swing voters hold a nation 's secrets . Sometimes they are important because of what they tell us about an election . But when the race is n't even close , they are important because of what they tell us about ourselves . <P> Thirty years ago , the crucial voter was a white , male factory worker  --  urban , ethnic , patriotic  --  who ripened into a Reagan Democrat and started swinging the White House to the G.O.P. But in 1996 the archetype has changed : she is a suburban , conservative , Midwestern working mother , 35 years old , earns her age , finished high school , maybe some college . Between 1992 and 1996 she has swung more dramatically than any other voter ; 20% of this group voted for Clinton last time ; he 's pulling 52% now . <P> And yet the lives of the voters who are deciding this race ca n't be read in the numbers . In some ways it matters less how much they earn than how many kids they have , less how they voted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less where they live than how they manage . <P> In the morning they strap the baby into the high chair with a handful of Cheerios on the tray , then stay alert for the sound of his choking while they take a two-minute shower . They consider a week at their in-laws ' a vacation and joke that they live at the Target store . They drive a big car not because they haul a lot of lumber but because it gives them a fleeting sense of control . Everything changes when they become parents  --  when life gets both richer and harder , and everything becomes a trade-off , and the self is no longer the center , and the future is no longer possible to ignore . <P> The campaigns are tracking this voter so closely that they can measure the " persuadability " of her neighborhood , block by treelined block . Millions have already been spent hunting for her , with an intensity matched only by her immunity to the whole effort . Campaign consultants are stalking her , the conventions were staged for her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her . And because she is so different from the swing voter who shaped this nation for a generation , she has miniaturized its politics into a kitchen-table bargaining session over what it might take to help her get through the day . <P> From there , the candidates draft the playbooks . Clinton signs a bill guaranteeing new mothers 48 hours in the hospital , one last chance to catch her breath , a last night 's sleep , courtesy of the President of the United States . It 's hard to find any money to put away for college , so Dole offers a deduction for student loans and a $500 tax credit per child . Mom ca n't be there screening what the kids watch on TV every minute , so here 's a V chip . It is not the craft of politics , it 's the art of coping .
