The recipients did not know why the gifts came , or how to ask for more . But still the money drizzled in , to universities and hospitals and service groups around the globe , paid in cashier 's checks and accompanied only by word that the giver wished to remain anonymous . In January the shroud lifted , revealing a tale of such unsung goodness that some almost wished its secrecy had been preserved . Charles F. Feeney , 66 , a businessman from New Jersey , had during the past decade given away more than $600 million through his two charitable foundations . At least $3.5 billion more  --  the entire value of Feeney 's ownership stake in the duty-free shop empire DFS Group Ltd. , which he turned over to the foundations in 1984  --  remains in the trusts ' coffers . Feeney 's beneficence already ranks among the grandest of any living American and may someday make him the most generous philanthropist of all time . <P> The only thing that astonished more than the size of Feeney 's largesse was his determination to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feeney incorporated his foundations in Bermuda and sought no tax deductions . For years Forbes magazine listed him as one of the 400 richest Americans , even though he has reportedly bled his wealth of all but $5 million ; Feeney abhors the list , but he let the fiction persist rather than betray his charity . Early in the year , a lawsuit over the sale by his foundation of its stake in DFS threatened to expose the scope of Feeney 's giving . So he broke out of his cocoon , telling the New York Times , " Money has an attraction for some people , but nobody can wear two pairs of shoes at one time . " <P> Feeney then retreated from the front pages , declining all interview requests . Friends helped assemble the fragments of his life : born poor in Elizabeth , N.J. ; fiercely loyal to his ancestral Ireland and his alma mater , Cornell ; a " shabby " dresser who flies coach and does not own a house or car . Reports of Feeney 's modest trappings are true , save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spokesman says it cost five bucks . <P> Feeney 's unmasking was the first of 1997 's philanthropic dramas , as a roaring bull market induced conspicuous giving from Ted Turner , George Soros and Bill Gates . And yet the richest 1% of Americans still give only 2% of their annual gross income to charity . It made Feeney 's silent work seem all the more admirable . In an age of aggrandizement , Feeney showed that humble hearts still beat . In many ways , that is a revelation even more gratifying than the sums he has given away . <P>  --  By Romesh Ratnesar
