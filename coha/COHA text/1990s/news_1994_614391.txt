<p> Republican businessman is described by friends , business associates as a man with little time for public frivolity . <p> On his way to a fortune , Guy Wesley Millner , once a lanky lad with a stutter , sold cookware , birthday cakes and temporary employment services . <p> The stutter is gone , but at the age of 58 , the founder of Norrell Corp . is making the sales pitch of his life : to convince three million Georgia voters that a Republican with no political experience should replace the veteran Democratic incumbent , Zell Miller . <p> " There is a strong parallel to politics and door-to-door selling , " Millner said . " You get a lot of rejection , but you get a lot of knowledge about human nature . " <p> To his supporters , he is a Horatio Alger . To the Miller campaign , he 's a con man . Some business enemies say he 's ruthless . But everyone agrees that Millner is a gifted salesman . <p> Prodded by his mother and envious of his schoolmates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working-class north Florida origins to build a $ 640 million temporary services agency and move into the former mansion of a soft-drink tycoon . <p> Reputation of being aloof <p> But in his workaholic quest for a better life , Millner has suffered through two divorces and seems to have made few deep friendships . <p> Former neighbors in Holly Hill , Fla. , Millner 's hometown , barely remember him , although they remember his parents . Fraternity brothers at Florida State University say they have n't heard from Millner since he graduated . In Atlanta business circles , Millner has a reputation of being aloof . <p> Most people from Millner 's past who would be interviewed for this story have favorable memories of the fast-moving salesman . But some former employees and business associates said he ran roughshod over their careers . <p> " If industriousness and commitment mean anything in serving as governor of a state , ( Millner ) certainly has those qualities , " said Charles Miner , a Florida judge , a Democrat and former president of Millner 's fraternity , Alpha Tau Omega @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . but the one Guy melts away and you see the Guy Millner who is aloof and cool and ruthless , " said Barbara Jane Moores , a Republican and former business associate . This year she won a court ruling against Norrell for breaching a contract . <p> From humble beginnings <p> Millner was born in the waning days of the Great Depression in a community of 12,000 just north of Daytona Beach , in circumstances he has described as " poor " but some might call lower-middle class . <p> His father , Jack , whom neighbors described as an amiable but unambitious man , ran a service station , owned a used furniture store and had a soda fountain . His mother , Nell , sold magazine subscriptions over the telephone . <p> As a salesman and political candidate , Millner has displayed the same kind of tenacity he said he learned by watching his mother 's phone solicitations . Another mentor was Zig Ziglar , the motivational speaker and sales guru , who was Millner 's sales trainer in college . Both taught him never to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call until you make the sale , " Millner said . " You go to one more , you go to one more . At last someone will say , ' Sure , come in . ' You make a sale . " <p> Determined or just rude ? <p> On the stump , Millner campaigns like a door-to-door salesman , calling himself a " businessman , not a politician . " Often watching his watch , he dashes from event to event - sometimes in an impolitic manner . <p> During a recent meeting with the editors of the Macon Telegraph , Millner said he was certain he would n't get their endorsement , then cut short the interview and left . <p> State Rep. Matt Towery ( R-Vinings ) , a Millner adviser , said people often misinterpret Millner 's determination as rudeness . <p> " He has a laser beam approach to things , " Towery said . " He is the type of guy who , when you sit down and meet with him , you 're meeting for a reason , and when that meeting is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose . He is not trying to be mean , he 's just trying to get something done . " <p> Millner has stumbled in some public appearances , but he has shined at fund-raisers . His pitch is not flashy , but direct and earnest , contributors say . Millner said his pledge to contribute a significant amount of his own money to the campaign gives him a license to ask for the support of others . <p> " If I ask you to dig a ditch , you may say , ' I do n't know . ' But if I say , ' Come and dig the ditch with me , ' I 'm there with you . I do n't hesitate to ask for a contribution . I 'll ask you for a contribution before it 's over , " Millner told a reporter . <p> In college , he used the same kind of infectious enthusiasm to inspire fraternity brothers to sell place settings and pots and pans . He had a knack for identifying potential markets . In 124 days in 1957 , Millner and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He would say , ' Now , you 've always got to nod your head and smile ; present a positive attitude , ' " recalled Gerry Davies , Millner 's former roommate , who took sales classes conducted by Millner . <p> Millner targeted single female students and state employees as customers , and gave his students kits that included a black tablecloth and candles . The pitch suggested that the cookware and place settings would be a good way to attract men . <p> Hero in south DeKalb <p> Millner also launched a successful cake business in which he contacted the parents of students with upcoming birthdays and offered to purchase cakes for their children for a fee . <p> " Guy was always the hustler ; he always had a scheme to make money , " said Bill Childers , a fraternity brother . He recalls Millner , who maintained a 2.7 average in college , as friendly but serious and reserved , and " a good student and a hard worker . " <p> Millner seems to have retained that seriousness in middle age . Once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Vidalia onion as the state 's vegetable , Millner did n't crack a smile . The public Millner smiles only occasionally . <p> Millner has built up an impressive civic record , but his involvement in community affairs gets mixed reviews . He 's a hero to students and administrators at Cedar Grove High School in south DeKalb , where he launched a hefty scholarship and some successful programs to improve student performance . <p> But some members of the Piedmont Park Conservancy , which Millner formerly chaired , found him to be dictatorial . Millner had sought to turn control of the park to private interests . <p> " He is a man accustomed to giving orders and not the give and take of the public arena , " said Mary Davis , a conservancy board member , Atlanta city councilwoman and Democrat . <p> Many of Millner 's supporters at Norrell say he ran the company by consensus . But Bea Ruffin , a former vice president of marketing , said , " One of the things that could be a problem for Guy if he 's elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life . That kind of experience would be important if he 's moving into an arena where people have to work together . " <p> That is not a concern of John Stuckey , a former state GOP chairman : " The ability to pick good people and surround himself with able lieutenants is . . . the determining factor . Millner must be a pretty good judge of horseflesh to have done what he 's done . "
