I wake up knowing that this is a special day . Today is Tessa 's birthday . She will be six . That means she will start school and I wo n't see her during the day at all . <p> My friends will have a party for Tessa and for me . The invitation sits on my bedside table , propped up against the telephone so I ca n't possibly forget it . I wish I could . There are pink pandas tumbling around the borders of the card and inside my friend Paula has written in the details of time and place in her beautiful handwriting . I get up , get dressed , get ready for the day ahead . Before I leave the apartment I make sure that I have n't locked Squeaker in the closet again . Squeaker is my cat . You 'd think it would be hard for a cat to hide in a studio apartment , but Squeaker manages . Tessa loves cats and pandas , just like me . She told me so . <p> I am almost out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seen it yet . Today will be my last chance to show it to her . I keep forgetting to take it with me , not because I want to deprive my daughter of anything but because of what this birthday means to us both . I do n't like to think about it . I tuck the invitation into my purse and go to work . <p> I arrive a little before nine . Mom always said I never plan ahead , but I do now . There are flowers on my desk at work , six pink fairy roses in a cut glass bud vase with a spill of shiny white ribbon tied around its neck . There is a freedom card propped open on the keyboard in front of my terminal , signed by most of the women in the office . I hang up my jacket and check my IN box for work , but there is nothing there , no excuse to turn on my terminal . Still , a good worker finds work to do even when there 's none , and I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and reach for a sampler sheet to rub over my thumb and slip into the terminal . Damn , the pad 's empty ! I know I had some left yesterday , what happened ? I ca n't turn on my terminal without giving it a sample of my cell-scrapings so the system knows it 's me . Who 's been getting at my things ! I 'll kill her ! <p> No . I must n't lose my temper like this . I have to set a good example for my girl . It 's important for a woman to make peace , to compromise . No one wins a war . Maybe whoever took the last of my sampler sheets needed it more than I do . Maybe she had to stay late , work overtime , an d everyone else locked their pads away in their desks so she had to help herself to mine . <p> " Good morning , Linda . " It 's my boss , Mr. Beeton . His melon face is shiny with a smile . " I see you 've found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say . <p> " Now , now , I know what day this is just as well as you do . Do you think the ladies are the only ones who want to wish you the best for the future ? Just became there 's a door on my office , it does n't mean I 'm sealed inside , ignorant of my girls ' lives . " He pats me on the back and says , " I 'm giving you the day off , with pay . Have fun . " And then he is gone , a walrus in a blue-gray suit waddling up the aisle between the rows of terminals . <p> I do n't want to have the day off . What will I do ? <p> Where will I go ? The party is n't until six o'clock tonight . There is so much I need to say to her before then . I suppose I could go to the bank , but that 's only ten seconds ' worth of time . It 's nowhere near enough . Here at work I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the aisle , staring at me . He must be wondering why I 'm still sitting here , staring at a blank screen . I 'd better go . I put on my jacket and walk away from my terminal . It will still be here tomorrow . So will part of me . <p> I hear the murmurs as I walk to the door . The women are smiling at me as I pass , sad smiles , encouraging smiles , smiles coupled with the fleeting touch of a hand on mine . " I 'm so happy for you , " they say . " You 're so strong . " <p> " I 've been praying for you . " <p> " Have a good time . " <p> " Have a good life . " <p> " See you tomorrow . " <p> But what will they see ? I think about how many sick days I have left . Not enough . I will have to come back tomorrow , and I will have to work as if everything were still the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevator I have to pass the Ladies ' Room . I hear harsh sounds , tearing sounds . <p> Someone is in there , crying . I do n't have to work today ; I can take the time to go in and see who it is , what 's wrong . Maybe I can help . Maybe this will kill some time . <p> The crying is coming from one of the stalls . " Who 's there ? " I call . The crying stops . There is silence , broken only by the drip of water from a faucet and a shallow , sudden intake of breath from the stall . <p> " What 's wrong ? " I ask . " Please , I can help you . " <p> " Linda ? " The voice is too fragile , too quavery for me to identify . " Is that you ? I thought Beeton gave you the day off . " <p> " He did , " I tell whoever it is in them . " I was just on my way out . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a little stronger , a little surer when giving a direct command . " Have fun . " Another shudder of breath frays the edges of her words . <p> I think I know who it is in there now .. Anyway , it 's worth a guess . " Ms. Thayer ? " What is she doing in here ? The executives have their own bathrooms . <p> A latch flicks ; the stall door swings open . Ms. Thayer is what I dreamed I 'd be someday , back when I was a Business major freshman in college : a manager never destined to waste her life in the middle reaches of the company hierarchy , a comer and a climber with diamond-hard drive fit to cut through any glass ceiling her superiors are fool enough to place in her way . Sleekly groomed , tall and graceful in a tailored suit whose modest style still manages to let the world know it cost more than my monthly take-home pay , Ms. Thayer is a paragon . Every plane of expensive fabric lies just so along a body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of her slim blue skirt seems to have rucked itself a little out of line . It bulges just a bit , as if  --  as if  --  <p> Oh . <p> " Would you like me to come with you ? " I ask her . I do n't need to hear confessions . " If it 's today , I mean . " If I 'm wrong , she 'll let me know . <p> She nods her head . Her nose is red and there is a little trace of slime on her upper lip . Her cheeks are streaked with red , her eyes squinched half-shut to hold back more tears . " I called , " she tells me . " I have a four o'clock appointment . Upstairs , they think I 'm going to the dentist . " <p> " I 'll meet you in the lobby , then , at three-thirty , " I promise . And I add , because I know this is what she needs to hear more than anything , " It 's not so bad . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stall . I hear the tears again , but they are softer this time . She is no longer so afraid . <p> I could take her sorrow from her as I took her fear by telling her there are ways to make what lies ahead a blessing , but I wo n't do that . She 'd never believe me , anyhow . I know I would never have believed anyone when it was me . Besides , I was in college . I knew it all , better than anyone who 'd been there , and the evening news was full of stories to back up my conviction that I 'd chosen purgatory over hell . You 're supposed to be able to survive purgatory . <p> I should have known better . Surviving is n't living , it 's only breath that does n't shudder to a stop , a heart that keeps lurching through beat after beat after beat long after it 's lost all reason to keep on beating . I was wrong . But I was in college , Mom and Dad had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meager scholarship and the actual cost of tuition , books , room and board . They said , " Make us proud . " <p> When I dropped out in junior year and got this job as a secretary , they never said a word . <p> I think I need a cup of coffee . I know I need a place to sit and think about what I 'll do to fill the hours between now and three-thirty , three-thirty and six . There 's a nice little coffee shop a block from the office , so I go there and take a booth . The morning rush is over ; no one minds . <p> The waitress knows me . Her name is Caroline . She is twenty-six , just two years older than me . Usually I come here for lunch at the counter , when there 's lots of cusotmers , but we still find time to talk . She knows me and I know her . Her pink uniform balloons over a belly that holds her sixth baby . She admires me for the way I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid here yet ? " I ask . <p> " Probably a boy , " she answers . " Men are never on time . " We both laugh . <p> " So how far along are you ? " <p> " Almost there . You do n't wan na know how close . " <p> " No kidding ? So why are you still  --  ? " <p> " Here ? Working ? " She laughs . " Like I 've got a choice ! " She takes my older and brings me my food . I eat scrambled eggs and bacon and toast soaked with butter . I drink three cups of coffee , black . I do n't want to live forever . I leave Caroline a big tip because its no joke having five  --  six kids to raise today 's prices , and a husband who does n't earn much more than minimum wage . <p> I get a good idea while I am smearing strawberry jam over my last piece of toast : The Woman 's Center . I do weekend volunteer work there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today and see if they can use me . I 'm free . <p> I try to hail a cab but all of them are taken , mostly by businessmen . Once I see an empty one sail past , but he keeps on going when I wave . Maybe he is nearsighted and ca n't see me through the driver 's bulletproof bubble . Maybe he is out of sampler sheets for his automatic fare-scan and is hurrying to pick up some more . Maybe he just assumes diet because I am a woman of a certain age I really do n't want to ride in a cab at all . <p> I walk a block west and take the bus . Busses do n't need fare-scan terminals because it always costs the same for every ride and you do n't need to key in the tip . Tokens are enough . I ride downtown across the aisle a woman with two small children , a boy and a girl . The boy is only two or three years old and sits in his mother 's lap , making rrrum-rrrum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about four and regards her brother scornfully . She sits in her own scat with her hands folded in the lap of her peach-colored spring coat . She wants the world to know that she is all grown up and impatient to leave baby things behind . I wonder it she 'll like kindergarten as much as Tessa did ? She did n't cry at all when it was time to go , even though it meant I could n't see her in the mornings . <p> Things are pretty quiet at the Woman 's Center . After all , it is a weekday , a workday . You have to work if you want to live . But Oralee is there . Oralee is always there , tall and black and ugly as a dog 's dinner , the way my mom would say . She is the Center manager . It does n't pay much , but it 's what she wants to do . She is seated at her desk  --  and old wooden relic from some long-gone public school  --  and when she sees me she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , happy freedom ! " She rises from her chair and rushes across the room to embrace me . Her skin is very soft and smells like lilacs . I do n't know what to do or say . Oralee lives with her lover Corinne , so I do n't feel right about hugging her back , no matter how much I like her or how grateful I am for all she 's done for me over the years . I would be easier if she had n't told me the truth about herself . A lesbian is a lesbian , I have no trouble hugging Corinne , but what Oralee is scares me . She clings to Corinne not because she loves her , but because it 's safe , because she 'll never have to risk anything that way , because her body craves touching . Oralee is always telling us we have to be brave , but she is a coward , pretending she 's something she 's not , out of fear . I can understand , but I ca n't like her for it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to sit down . She leans forward , her elbows on the blotter , a pen twiddling through her fingers . " So , to what do we owe the honor ? " she asks , a grin cutting through the scars that make her face look like a topographical map with mountains pinched up and valleys gouged in . Today she wears the blue glass eye that does n't match working brown one and that startles people who do n't know her . <p> " My boss gave me the day off , " I tell her . " With pay . " <p> " Well , of course he did . Soul-salving bastard . " <p> " I have to be somewhere at three-thirty , but I though that until then you might have something for me to do here . " <p> Oralee pushes her chair a little away from her desk . The casters squeak and the linoleum floor complains . She runs her fingers over her shaven skull in though . " Well , Joan and Cruz are already handling all the paperwork . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next week , no need for follow-up phone calls , the envelopes are all stuffed and in the mail . . . " <p> My heart sinks as she runs down a list of things that do n't want doing . I try not to think about the empty hours I 'll have to face if Oralee ca n't use me . To distract myself while I await her verdict , I look at all the things cluttering up her desktop . There is an old soup can covered with yellow-flowered shelving paper , full of paper clips , and another one full of pens and pencils . Three clay figurines of the Goddess lie like sunbathers with pendulous breasts and swollen bellies offered up to the shameless sky . Oralee made the biggest one herself , in a ceramics class . She uses Her for a paperweight . Oralee says she is a firm believer in making do with what you 've got . Mr. Beeton would laugh out loud if he could see the antiquated terminal she uses . All you need to access it is a password that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get into your files if they discover what it is . At least this way the Woman 's Center saves money on sampler pads , even if that 's not the real reason . <p> The photo on the desk is framed with silver , real silver . Oralee has to polish it constantly to keep the tarnish at bay . The young black woman in the picture is smiling , her eyes both her own , her face smooth and silky-looking as the inner skin of a shell , her hair a soft , dark cloud that enhances her smile more beautifully than any silver frame . <p> At the bottom of the frame , under the glass with the photograph , there is a newspaper clipping . It 's just the headline and it 's not very big . The event it notes was nothing extraordinary enough to merit more prominent placement on the page : ABORTION CLINIC BOMBED . TWO DEAD , THREE INJURED . The clipping came from a special paper , more like a newsletter for the kind of people : who would read TWO DEAD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the papers were n't like that ; they used to call them birth control clinics or family planning clinics or even just women 's clinics . As if we 're none of us old enough to remember when it changed ! She talks about those days  --  the times when the bombings were stepped up and the assaults on women trying to reach the clinics got ugly and the doctors and sometimes their families were being threatened , being killed  --  as if they 'd lasted as long as the Dark Ages instead of just four years . Thank goodness everything 's settled down . We 're civilized people , after all . We can compromise . <p> " I know ! " Oralee snaps her fingers , making me look up . " You can be a runner . That is  --  " She hesitates . <p> " Yes , I can do that , " I tell her . <p> " Are you sure ? " <p> " Just give me what I need and tell me where I have to go . It 's all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself anyway . " <p> " Are you sure ? " she asks again . Why does she doubt me ? Do I look so fragile ? No . I take good care of my ' body , wash my hair every day , even put on a little lipstick sometimes . It 's not like before , that hard time when I first came to the city , when I was such a fool . I almost lost my job , then , because I was letting myself go so badly . I know better , now . It 's my duty to set a good example . Children past a certain age start to notice things like how Mommy looks and how Mommy acts . I 've read all the books . You get the child you deserve . <p> Oralee goes into the back room where they keep the refrigerator . She comes back with a compartmentalized cold pack the size of a clutch purse , a factory-fresh sampler pad , and a slip of paper . " You can put this in your pocketbook if you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pack . " Make sure you only keep it open long enough to take out or put in one sample at a time . And for the love of God , do n't mix up the samples ! " <p> I smile at how vehement she sounds . " I 've done this before , Oralee , " I remind her . <p> " Sure you have ; sorry . Here are the names and addresses . Bus tokens are in the clay pot on the table by the front door . You do n't have to bring back the pack when you 're done ; just drop it off next time you 're here . " She cocks her head . " If you are coming back ? " <p> " Of course I am , " I say , surprised that she 'd think I would n't . <p> " Oh , " she says . " Because I thought  --  you know  --  after today 's over - Well , whatever . Good luck . " <p> There are five flames on the list , most of them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them farther uptown . It 's a glorious spring day . Soon it will be Easter . The holiday came late this year , almost the end of April . I think April is a pretty name to give a girl  --  April , full of hope and promise , full of beauty . Maybe I should have named my daughter April . I laugh away the thought . What 's done is done , too late now to change Tessa 's name . Too late . <p> When I get to the first place I 'm surprised by how old the woman is who answers the door . I introduce myself and say that the Woman 's Center sent me . I show her the cold pack and the sampler pad , telling her what I 'll do for her at the bank . She has black hair that is so shot through with silver threads it looks gray , and her fingers are stained with tobacco . She stands in the doorway , stony-eyed , barring me from the dark apartment beyond , making me stand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> After I have finished and I 'm standing there , holding out one sampler sheet , she speaks : " I 'm not Vicky , " she says . " I 'm her mother . God will judge you people . You go to hell . " And she slams the door in my face . <p> I feel like a fool , but by the time I reach the next address on the list the feeling has faded . It 's better here . The woman 's name is Maris and she lives alone . She urges me to come in , to have a cup of tea , some cookies , anything I 'd like . Her apartment is small but tasteful , a lot of wicker , a lot of sunlight . " God bless you , " she says . " I was just about at my wits ' end . I thought if I had to go through that one more time I 'd go crazy . It ' s supposed to get easier with time , but it just gets harder . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Never again , believe me ; never again . " <p> She rubs the sampler sheet over her thumb and watches like a hawk as I fumble it into its thin plastic envelope . The envelope goes into the cold pack and the cold pack goes back into my purse . " Are you sure you remember my password ? " she asks as she sees me to the door . <p> " Yes , but please change it after today , " I tell her . <p> The third and fourth women are not as hospitable as Maris , but there is no one there to tell me to go to hell . One of them is an artist , the other lost her job , and Maris , I recall , told me she 'd taken a sick day off from work just on the off chance the Woman 's Center could find a runner to come help her . It feels very strange to me , sitting in rooms freckled with spring sunshine , to be talking with strange women when I would normally be at work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three cups of tea and also share a little gin with the woman who has lost her job . My head spins with passwords and special instructions , my hands clasp a pile of three plain brown self-addressed stamped envelopes by the time I teeter out the door in search of my final contact . <p> I take the bus uptown . Out the window I see news leaves unfurl in blurs of green made more heartstoppingly tender by the gin . It was a mistake to drink , but if I looked into the glass I did n't have to look into the woman 's eyes . I decide to get off the bus a few blocks away from my stop . A walk will clear my head . <p> The blue and red and white lights flash , dazzling me . Two police cars and a crowd have gathered outside a restaurant that 's trying to be a Paris sidewalk cafe . A man is clinging to the curlicued iron fence around one of the trees in front of the place , his face a paler green than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pungent . I watch where I step as I try to make my way through the crowd . <p> One of the policemen is holding a shopping bag and trying to make the crowd back away . The bottom of the shopping bag looks wet . Another one is telling the people over and over that there is nothing here for them to see , but they know better . <p> A third stands with pad in hand , interviewing a waiter . The waiter looks young and frightened . He keeps saying , " I did n't know , I had no idea , she came in and ordered a Caesar salad and a cup of tea , then she paid the bill and started to go . I did n't even notice she 'd left that bag under the table until that man grabbed it and started to run after her . " He points to the man embracing the iron girdle of the tree . " I did n't know a thing . " <p> The girl is in the fourth policeman 's custody . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and small for her age . Her face is flat , vacant . What does she see ? The policeman helps ; her into the back of his squad car and slams the door . " Said she could n't face it , going to a clinic , having it recorded like a decent woman . Bitch , " I hear him mutter . " Murderer . " <p> As I walk past , quickening my step as much as I can without beginning to ran , I hear the waiter 's fluting voice say , " I do n't think it was dead when she got here . " <p> A man answers the door when I ring the bell at my last stop . " Frances Hughes ? " I ask nervously . Has a prankster cal led the Woman 's Center , giving a man 's name that sounds like a woman 's ? Oralee says it 's happened before . Sometimes a prank call only leads to a wild goose chase , but sometimes when the runner arrives they 're waiting for her . Trudy had her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collected so far . It was just like those stories about Japanese soldiers lost for years on small islands in the Pacific , still fighting a war that was over decades ago . <p> The man smiles at me . " No , I 'm her husband , " he says . " Wo n't you come in ? " <p> Frances Hughes is waiting for me in the living room . She is one of those women whose face reflects years of breeding and who looks as if she were born to preside over a fine china tea service on a silver tray . If I drink one more cup of tea I think I 'll die , but I accept the cup she passes to me because she needs to do this . <p> " We ca n't thank you enough , " her husband says as he sits down in the Queen Anne armchair across from mine . Frances sits on the sofa , secure behind a castle wall of cups and saucers , sliced lemons and sugar cubes and lacy silver tongs . " I wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " You know you could n't do it , George , " says Frances . " Remember how hard it was for you in the clinic , and after ? " <p> " I could do it , " he insists stubbornly . <p> " But you do n't have to , " she tells him softly . " Spare yourself , for me . " She reaches over to stroke his hand . There is an old love between them and I feel it flow in waves of strength from her to him . <p> I leave their building still carrying just three brown envelopes . They do n't want me to mail them any cash , like the others ; they only want me to dose Frances ' personal account and transfer the funds into George 's . <p> I also have a check in my wallet from Mr. George Hughes made out to the Woman 's Center . He gave it to me when I was leaving the apartment , while I set my purse aside on a miniature bookcase and rebuttoned my jacket . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know what he meant . Then , just as I was picking up my purse , my eye lit on the title of one of the volumes in that bookcase . <p> " No Remorse ? " <p> It is the book that changed things for good , for ill . You can still find it for sale all over . My aunt Lucille gave a copy to my mother . My mother has not spoken to her since . They study it in schools with the same awe they give to Uncle Tom 's Cabin and Mein Kampf . Some say , " It stopped the attacks , the bombings , it saved lives . " Others say , " It did n't stop the deaths . So what if they 're forced to suffer ? It still sanctioned murder . " Some reply , " It threw those damned extremists a sop , it truly freed women . " And others yet say , " It sold out our true freedom for a false peace , it made us terror 's slaves . " I say nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did to me . <p> I looked at Frances ' husband and I wanted to believe that the book had come there by accident , left behind by a caller who was now no longer welcome under that roof . But when he looked away from me and his face turned red , I knew the truth . I took the check . " You go to hell , " I told him , the same way Vicky 's mother said it to me . <p> I will not use Frances Hughes ' password and sample to steal : I could , but I wo n't . I will not betray as I hope not to be betrayed . But George Hughes does n't know that . Let him call ahead to his bank , change the password . Let him be the one to come down and face the truth of what he 's helped to bring about , this dear-won , bloodyminded peace . Let him twist in the wind . <p> There is almost no line worth mentioning at the bank . It is a small branch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past a certain level of complexity . All others can be taken care of through the ATMs . There is only one ATM here . As I said , this is a small branch . <p> I prefer small banks . Larger ones sometimes have live employees on duty whose only job is to make sure that no one uses the ATMs to perform transactions for a third party . That would be cheating . <p> I stand behind a man who stands behind a woman . She looks as if she is at least fifty years old , but when it is her turn she does not take one of the sampler sheets from the dispenser . Instead she opens her purse and takes out a cold pack like mine , a little smaller . Her hands are shaking as she extracts the sheet , inserts it , and types in the password . <p> The child is no more than nine months old . It can coo and gurgle . It can paw at the screen with its plump , brown hands . " Hi , sugar , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Nana , darlin ' , hi . It 's your nana . Your mama could n't come here today ; she sick . She 'll come see you soon , I promise . I love you , baby . I love  --  " <p> The screen is dark . A line of shining letters politely requests that the woman go on with her transaction . She stares at the screen , tight-lipped , and goes on . Bills drop one after another into the tray . She scoops them out without even bothering to look down , crams them into her purse , and walks out , seeing nothing but the door . <p> The man ahead of me dashes a sampler sheet over his thumb , inserts it , and does his business . He looks young in his twenties . He is handsome . The girls must have a hard time resisting him , especially if he knows how to turn on the charm . He may have the ability to make them think he is failing in love with them , the passion of novels , spontaneous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Accidents can change your life , but only if you let them . While he is waiting for the ATM to process his transaction , he turns his head so that I can see his profile . He looks like a comic book hero , steadfast and noble , loyal and true . If there were an accident , he would accompany her to the clinic . He would hold her hand and stay with her for as long as the doctors allowed . And then it would all be over for him and he could go home , go about his business . No one would insist on making sure he stayed sorry for what was done . <p> There is no picture on the screen for him . <p> I am next . I do the other transactions first . Maris has a little three-year-old boy , like the one I saw on the bus . He can talk quite well for his age . He holds up a blue teddy bear to the screen . " T'ank you , Mommy , " he says . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tadda-boy . " He presses the bear 's snout to the glass . <p> The artist 's little girl is still only a few months old . This is easy . I never had any trouble when Tessa was this young . I could pretend I was watching a commercial for disposable diapers on the t.v . It got harder after Tessa learned to do things , to roll over , to push herself onto hands and knees , to toddle , to talk . . . <p> The woman who lost her job has a one-year-old with no hair and the bright , round eyes of the blue teddy bear . I ca n't tell whether this is a boy or a girl , but I know he or she will be blond . Tessa is blond . She looked like a fuzzy-headed little duckling until she was almost two . <p> I see why Frances Hughes did not let George handle this . The child lies on its back , staring straight up with dull eyes . It must be more than a year old , judging from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even to rum its head . I feel sorry for Frances . Then I remember the book in their house and for a moment I am tempted to believe that there is a just God . <p> Of course I know better . <p> It 's my turn . I glance over my shoulder . A line has formed behind me . Four people are waiting . They look impatient . One of them is a woman in her sixties . She looks angry . I guess they have been standing in line long enough to notice that I am not just doing business for myself . <p> I leave the ATM and walk to the back of the line . As I pass the others I murmur how sorry I am for making them wait , how there was no one waiting behind me when I began my transactions . The three people who were merely impatient now smile at me . The woman in her sixties is at the end of the line . She waits until I have taken my place behind her , then she turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " she shouts . " Murdering bitch ! You and all the rest like you , baby killers , damned whores , ca n't even face up to your sins ! Get the hell out of  --  " <p> " I 'm sorry , ma'am , but I 'm going to have to ask you to leave . " The bank 's sole live employee is standing between us . He is a big man , a tall man . I have yet to see one of these small branches where the only live worker is not built like a bodyguard . That is part of the job too . <p> " You should toss her out , not me ! " the woman snaps . She lunges for me , swatting at me with her purse . I take a step backwards , holding the envelopes tight to my chest . I am afraid to drop them . She might get her hands on one and tear it up . <p> The man restrains her . " Ma'am , I do n't want to have to call the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bristling , she stalks out of the bank , cursing me loudly . The man looks at me but does not smile . " In the future , please limit yourself to personal transactions , " he says . <p> " Thank you , " I say , dabbing the woman 's spittle from my cheek with a tissue . <p> It is my turn again . I want to kiss the sampler sheet before I run it across my thumb , but I know that if I do that , I will not be able to access my account . I wonder how long we will have together ? Sometimes it is ten seconds , sometimes fifteen . Maybe they will give us twenty because it 's Tessa 's birthday . I take a deep breath and insert the sampler sheet , then enter my password . <p> There she is ! Oh my God , there she is , my baby , my daughter , my beautiful little girl ! She is smiling twirling to show off her lovely pink party dress with all the crisp ruffles . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hi , Mama ! " she chirps . <p> " Hi , baby . " My hand reaches out to caress her cheek . I have to hold it back . Touching the screen is not allowed . It either cuts off the allotted seconds entirely , or cuts them short , or extends them for an unpredictable amount of time . Few risk the gamble . I ca n't ; not today . <p> I take out the invitation and hold it up so that Tessa can see it . " Look , honey , " I say . " Pandas ! " <p> " I 'm going to school tomorrow , " Tessa tells me . " I 'm a big girl now . I 'm almost all grown up . " <p> " Baby . . . " " My eyes are blinking so fast , so fast ! Tessa becomes a sweet pink and gold blur . " Baby , I love you so much . I 'm sorry , I 'm so sorry for what I did , but I was so young , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And I will touch her , I will ! It 's all lies they tell us anyway , about how touching the screen will affect how long we may see our children , about how now we are safe to choose , about how our compromise was enough to stop the clinic bombings and the assassinations of doctors and the fear . I do n't believe them ! I will hold my child ! <p> Glass , smooth and dark . <p> " I 'm sorry , ma'am , but I 'm going to have to ask you to leave . " <p> I go with my own business left undone . The man takes a spray bottle of glass cleaner and a cloth from his desk and wipes away the prints of my hands , the image of my lips . <p> There is another small bank that I like on the east side . I think I 'll go there . I start to walk . It 's getting late . Paula must be making all kinds of last-minute phone calls , settling the details of my party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> At first I hated her , you know . I hated my own child . She was there , always there , on every CRT device I chose to use in college , in public , at home . After the procedure , the college clinic forwarded the developmental information that the central programming unit needed to establish her birthdate . The tissue was sent along too , so that they could project a genetically accurate image of my child . She was n't there until her birthdate , but then  --  ! <p> Then there was no escaping her . Not if I wanted to use a computer , or an ATM , or even turn on any but the most antiquated model of a television set . I hated her . I hated her the way some hate the children of rape who also live behind the glass , after . But they exult in what they 've done , how they 've had the last laugh , how they 've cheated their assailants of the final insult . I have seen them in the banks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who 's got the power now ? they shout at the children , and they laugh until they cry . Sometimes they only cry . <p> I fled her . I ran away  --  away from college , away from home , away from so much that had been my life before . Away from Tessa . A mandatory sentence of six years of persecution for one mistake , one accident , seemed like an eternity . She was almost the end of my future and my sanity . <p> And then , one day , it changed . One day I looked at her and she was n't a punishment ; she was my little girl , my Tessa with her long , silky blonde curls and her shining blue eyes and her downy cheeks that must smell like roses , like apples . One day I was tired of hating. tired of running . One day I looked at her and I felt love . <p> Now they 're taking my baby away . <p> No . <p> I find a phone booth . " Hello , Ms. Thayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't go with you to the clinic today . . . Yes , this is Linda . . . No , really , you 'll be all right . No one will bother you ; it 's against the law . And after , you 'll handle it just fine . . . Sure , you will . I did . " <p> " Hello , Mr. Beeton ? This is Linda . I do n't think I 'll be in tomorrow ... Yes , I know you ca n't give me two days off with pay . That 's all right . " <p> " Hello , Paula ? Linda . Listen , there 's a spare key with my neighbor , Mrs. Giancarlo . Feed Squeaker . . . No , just do it , I ca n't talk now . And for God 's sake , do n't let him hide in the closet . I have to go . Good-bye . " <p> I am walking east . I realize that I am still holding the envelopes full of all the money the women need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all together . . . I could buy a lot of pretty things for Tessa with so much money . I could afford to keep her , if I were rich as Frances Hughes . <p> There are no mail boxes near the river . I 'm letting them all down , all of them except for Frances Hughes and her husband . I 'm so sorry . Maybe I should call Oralee  --  ? No . She 's , a coward . I despise her . If I turn back to find a mailbox , I might turn back forever . Then I 'll be a coward too . It 's Tessa who 's been so brave , so loving so alone for so long , and still she smiles for me . Tessa is the only one that matters . <p> I lean against the railing and see another shore . Gulls keen and dip their wings above the river . Starveling trees claw the sky . The envelopes flutter from my hands , kissing the water . No one is near . I take off my shoes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold through my stockings . <p> There she is . I see her as I have always seen her , smiling up at me through the sleek , shining surface that keeps us apart . She is giggling as she reaches out for the envelopes . Oh , greedy little girl ! You ca n't spend all that . Now that you 're six , maybe Mama will give you an allowance , just like the big girls . After all , you 're going to school tomorrow . But first , let Mama give you a kiss . <p> We fly into each other 's arms . Oh , Tessa , your lips are so cool ! Your laughter rushes against my ears . I breathe in , and you fill my heart . <p> Happy birthday , my darling . <p> <p> By Esther M. Friesner <p> Esther M.
