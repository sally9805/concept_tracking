Republican Mudbath II . <p> As pundits paw over this year 's election results , they should ponder an event that should have taken place , but did n't : an overdue revival of the civil rights movement . As this year 's election approached , a host of factors  --  anxiety about the L.A. riots , impatience with racial theatrics in places like New York , and a surge of post-Gulf war idealism  --  gave both political parties a chance to assert that claim in a new and exciting way . Neither party rose to the occasion . <p> Since the death of Martin Luther King Jr. , the United States has lost its civil rights bearings . Laws have been instituted that encourage division and reward envy . By the 1970s federal judges were redesigning school districts and drawing up business plans . Employers were crafting minority quotas in order to avoid costly lawsuits . The Civil Rights Movement began to degenerate into something Hubert Humphrey promised it would not : " an endless power struggle among organized groups ... a society where there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had struggled in places like Selma began to mutter about " reverse discrimination . " <p> By this year Democrats had surrendered their monopoly on the minority vote . Black middle-class voters and the civil rights establishment openly advertised their skepticism about Bill Clinton . Although he talked about unity and harmony , he employed legalisms that left conspicuous avenues of escape . Moreover , he delivered the campaign 's only racially divisive speech when he spoke to the Rainbow Coalition . His seeming determination to snub Jesse Jackson offended potential admirers . A friend of mine , a conservative black not involved in politics , put it this way : " I do n't care what he said about Sister Souljah . That was n't the point at all . He came to show up Jesse . And even though I do n't like Jesse , I hate that kind of grandstanding even more . " <p> Clinton 's missteps handed Republicans a major chance to regain the high ground on the civil rights debate . We needed just three things : rhetoric worthy of the moment ; actions consistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let us assail prejudices without creating new class frictions . We fumbled each . <p> Take rhetoric . The first rule of racial politics is : show you care . John E Kennedy set off a sea change in black voting patterns by placing a phone call in 1960 to Coretta Scott King while her husband was in jail . We failed to provide any such acts of concern . President Bush took no trips into embattled black communities outside Los Angeles . Nor did he use black success stories to promote and explain his vision of government . He delivered no significant campaign speeches on race and racial harmony ; no speeches to invite black voters into the Republican Party ; and no speeches explaining how his policies offered minorities the greatest compliment of all  --  treatment as capable equals , rather than as members of a victimized class entitled to dribs of pity and drabs of the public fisc . The closest we got to " I have a dream " was to say , " I have a thirteen-point action plan , " seasoned with the applause line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intolerance , or bigotry in this country ! " <p> Republicans could have shattered this political gridlock by saying : enough of this silliness . Let 's be honest . Let 's talk . Instead , we clumsily courted minority voters . The Republican convention featured blacks primarily as props  --  candidates , preachers , entertainers , and emissaries from the wildernesses where poor people live . With a few exceptions , we did not celebrate black success or hold up our speakers as role models for our kids . <p> Meanwhile , our tortuously ambivalent actions seemed to say : we do n't know what we believe . Consider our handling of the Voting Rights Act . In recent years Republicans have joined dozens of court suits designed to create " black " congressional districts . The idea is to persuade courts to create suburban , Republican districts next to the court-ordered minority districts . This tactic not only violates the conservative opposition to quotas ; it does n't work . This year 's election did not produce the dramatic swing in congressional seats that our redistricting mavens sought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas 's confirmation victory gave the administration a chance to demand a new pluralism in the civil rights debate . The almost comic discomfort of the Senate Judiciary Committee cleared the way for a challenge to the civil rights orthodoxy and a declaration of intent to revive the spirit of the civil rights movement . A few speech drafts along these lines circulated among senior- and junior-level officials , but nothing reached the president 's desk . In the end , President Bush blasted congressional arrogance in what White House insiders called " the process speech , " but he did not tackle the grittier issues of race . Instead we chose to play on the Democrats ' turf , talking defensively about sexual harassment  --  and letting Joseph Biden and company off the hook . In our big moment , we chose process over passion . <p> That was n't the only fumble . On the night of the Thomas confirmation , we announced agreement on the Civil Rights Act of 1991 . Our lawyers worked hard and long to ensure that the bill prosecuted acts of discrimination without coercing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Democrats simply declared victory , implying that we had caved in on quotas . Our silence gave the impression that we had . This made everyone mad . The president 's courageous actions thus earned him virtually nothing in terms of political capital . <p> When Assistant Secretary Of Education Michael Williams proposed that the Department of Education abolish race-specific scholarships , he reiterated a natural-rights position as old and venerable as Lincoln . Yet the moment his recommendation attracted hostile fire from the press and pols , we pulled back  --  said we 'd study the recommendation . <p> Similarly , panic broke out when White House counsel C. Boyden Gray circulated a draft executive order that would forbid quotas in the federal government . The order vanished almost as soon as a hostile bureaucrat leaked it . Williams later advocated reviving the Gray order , with one addition  --  tripling the budget and staff of those charged with rooting out discrimination within the federal government . Great idea , but it too went nowhere . <p> We even failed to draw sensible moral lessons from the L.A. riots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , L.A. Mayor Tom Bradley , California Governor Pete Wilson , and Peter Ueberroth all pledged their full support to a comprehensive package of aid and innovation-the kind of " empowerment " package that Jack Kemp has advocated for years . But after Kemp 's moment in the spotlight came to an end , the campaign moved on to other things . <p> Some Republicans remain terminally uncomfortable with issues involving race . One can still find those who regard black Americans as a group apart  --  poor , exotic , faintly criminal , and not fully equipped for life in polite society . In the grips of remorse , these Republicans act like white liberals : anxious , guilt-besotted , stricken by low self-esteem . They try to expiate their sins by behaving like what Peggy Noonan once called " low-rent Democrats . " They try to buy black votes , but at a discount  --  through welfare funding at slightly reduced values , or pared-down versions of reforms like Kemp 's HOPE program . <p> Conservatives will never win minority votes by masquerading as Democrats . If conservatives wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains the only arena of American life where people look placidly upon the practice of separate accommodation by race  --  and we should demand equal accommodation , true inclusion , and common sense . We must return to the Lincoln-King version of civil rights . <p> This leads to the third failure : the vision thing . The president 's politics included everything necessary to pitch a Lee Atwater-style " Big Tent . " His conservative proposals on crime , welfare , education , health care , tax regulations , and housing dealt with issues of special concern to blacks , but not exclusively to blacks . More importantly , they placed real power in the hands of individuals , rather than in the mitts of government paper-pushers . School choice would let poor parents choose the schools best for their kids . Welfare reforms would have dismantled the gilded cage that we have constructed for our poor , and eliminate regulations that punish the virtues we normally consider vital for success : hard work , advancement , intact marriage , savings , and property . Housing reforms would give poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independence by owning their homes . <p> Most importantly , the president 's agenda treated all people equally . It could have promoted brotherhood instead of a Hobbesian scramble for entitlements and other federal table scraps . Unfortunately , we never pitched the tent . Nor did we draw the proper contrast between our Big Tent and the tent city in which Democrats live  --  a world of fractious , well-organized , and often mutually exclusive interest groups . This failure was deliberate . Senior advisers argued that we could not win on racial issues , and should just shut up . <p> So when Bill Clinton snubbed Jesse Jackson , we refused to raise the debate to a higher ground by engaging Clinton on such issues as quotas . A senior official told me , " In politics , you never get in the way when your opponent is destroying himself . Just let Jesse and Clinton carve each other up . Do n't get involved , and do n't worry . After all , Clinton 's dead . " Others argued against courting black voters on grounds that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This stratagem assumed that the " Bubba " vote  --  Southern , white , male , conservative  --  still worshiped at the altar of Jim Crow . <p> Top " White House officials repeatedly rejected suggestions that we deliver identical conservative speeches in " white " and " black " venues , so as to demonstrate that we do not pander . They refused before Super Tuesday , after the L.A. riots , and in the waning days of the campaign . Clinton did adopt the tactic , however , during the Illinois primary . <p> Our reluctance sometimes bordered on the absurd . Early this year , schedulers turned away a visit request by a national championship athletic team from Jackson State University that wanted to pay its way to the White House  --  a winning golf team . And when the president spoke to his own black appointees during the final month of the campaign , an order from on high decreed that he " say nothing , " in order not to interrupt coverage of the day 's real news story  --  automobile insurance reform . <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation 's black population agrees with virtually every item in a typical Republican platform  --  especially the sections on crime , education , national defense , traditional values , and abortion . More than 90 percent agree with the party 's stand on such issues as school choice . Blacks do n't reject Republicans because our ideas lack appeal . They reject us because we do n't court them , and Democrats do . <p> This year George Bush gathered a smaller percentage of the black vote than he got in the " Willie Horton " year of 1988 , and than Ronald Reagan claimed in 1984 . And that was everything : If George Bush had claimed even 20 percent of the black vote , he would be president-reelect today . <p> By Tony Snow <p> <p> Tony Snow is deputy assistant to the president for media affairs .
