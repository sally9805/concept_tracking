No one embodied Wall Street 's gold-rush spirit of the 1980s more than Peter Cohen , the high-strung chairman of the investment firm Shearson Lehman Hutton . A short , cigar-smoking firebrand , Cohen transformed Shearson from a stolid retail brokerage into an investment-banking giant . Backed by American Express , which bought the firm for $360 million in 1981 , Shearson grew from 11,000 employees to 47,000 by the mid- ' 80s . But Cohen 's expansion drive proved unstable . Hurt by several missteps and the slowing pace of Wall Street dealmaking , Shearson 's investment-banking revenue declined 27% last year , to $963 million . <P> As the stress on Cohen increased , his composure frayed . Colleagues reportedly heard him yelling over the phone at his boss , American Express Chairman James Robinson III . At one point , Cohen even had his offices at Shearson swept for listening devices . When Robinson pressured Cohen for his resignation last week , the Shearson chief complied . As Robinson told TIME : " The conditions of the market , the problems on Wall Street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to Peter 's feeling that his own identification had been linked to so many of the problems that he could not provide the ongoing leadership that the firm deserved . " To succeed Cohen , Robinson named Howard Clark Jr. , who is known to favor a no-frills corporate style , as the chief financial officer of American Express . " Times have changed , " says Lawrence Eckenfelder , who follows the securities industry for Prudential-Bache . " The name of the game now is to wring out the excess , cut costs , retrench . " <P> The son of a Long Island clothing manufacturer and a graduate of Columbia Business School , Cohen had planned to enter the family business but changed his mind when his father offered him only half the going rate for M.B.A.s , then $12,000 a year . Eventually Cohen joined a brokerage firm named CWBL- Hayden , Stone , one of the forerunners of Shearson . By 1983 , Cohen had been named chief executive of Shearson , making him , at 36 , the youngest head of a major Wall Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would rival Merrill Lynch in size . In 1984 he orchestrated a $360 million merger between Shearson/American Express and Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb . That move catapulted Shearson into the immensely profitable investment-banking business . But signs of stress began to appear in the wake of the 1987 stock-market crash , when Shearson paid nearly $1 billion to acquire E.F . Hutton . Dozens of top-notch Hutton brokers defected to other investment firms . At the same time , the firm suffered dwindling business from individual investors , on whom Shearson was still heavily dependent . Cohen , meanwhile , who had begun acting the part of the jet-setting dealmaker , was paying less attention to the day-to-day management of his empire . <P> The crowning blow came in the fall of 1988 , when Shearson lost the $25 billion buyout battle for RJR Nabisco , the largest takeover fight in history . Wall Street insiders contend that Cohen  --  whose firm had advised F. Ross ( Johnson , then the head of RJR , in his original bid for the company  --  stumbled badly by assuming that takeover specialist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kravis surprised Cohen with a higher bid and eventually outmaneuvered the Shearson executive .
