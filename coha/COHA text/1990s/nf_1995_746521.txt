INTERNAL OBSTACLES TO EUROPEAN INTEGRATION <p> The process of European integration is complex and difficult to realize in a short time . Many obstacles and doubts are observed . One is a lack  --  on a mass scale  --  of knowledge of the essence , goals , and assumptions of the integration of Europe . For some citizens , it is understood as a form of economic aid for less-developed countries , or a way of reaching the living standard of developed European states . Such excessive expectations of help and profit for citizens cause growing fears and opposition toward integration , or disappointment when unreal expectations are not fulfilled . <p> Nationalists are the main opponents of European integration . Expressions of nationalism in its overpowering forms , such as anti-German-ism , anti-Russianism , and anti-Semitism , appear with varying intensity . <p> Nationalistic resistance can be strong , especially in those countries that have just reached full independence . There are fears that integration is a modem form of the hegemonic tendencies of the economically strongest states . Fears are present that recent dependence on Moscow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because the European Parliament has limited powers , institutions of the European Union ( EU ) may be dominated by the interests of the strongest of the old member states . The question arises : Will Poland , as a full member of the EU , be an equal partner ? <p> In the European Union , a " role of subsidiarity " exists , which means delegating individual country rights to higher levels of authority to achieve the prosperity of the whole Union . Who will define the borders of subsidiarity needed for achieving common goals ? One of the solutions might be to delegate some rights gradually as the European Union stabilizes and new member states gain confidence in it . Mutual trust among member states should be permanent and widespread . <p> There is a strong fear that Poland will be bought up by rich foreigners . This fear has its sources in the nineteenth-century history of Poland , when invaders  --  mainly in the Russian and Prussian sectors  --  deprived Poles of their land . <p> After Poland had regained her independence in 1918 , the Seym @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such sales had to be approved by two ministers : home office and agriculture . The same is true today . One of the farmers ' representatives in the Seym recently said : " As much Poland , as much land under Polish plough . " It sounds grim  --  " Poland for the Poles only . " Meanwhile , there is no significant demand for Polish land . The 1993 report of the Seym says that agreement for the purchase of land in the year was given to citizens of Germany  --  474 hectares ; the United States  --  125 hectares ; and Sweden  --  47 hectares . Permission was given for the purchase of a total of 1,518 hectares to 1,291 applicants : The problem  --  an archaic one  --  will have to be solved because it might become one of the obstacles to Poland 's joining the European Union . Even today it impedes the flow of foreign capital to Poland from companies that want to build enterprises but on land they own . There is one and a half million hectares of land in Poland lying fallow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the policy of a democratic state , signs of hostility toward strangers occur from time to time . Ill will toward foreign capital , especially German , appears . Strikes have been organized in privatized factories in Tychy and Lublin that had been sold to foreign buyers , because there had been threats of mass firings and production reductions . <p> Asked what groups should be barred from acquiring former state enterprises , Poles responded : Russians ( 66 percent ) , Jews ( 59 percent ) , Germans ( 54 percent ) , Englishmen ( 44 percent ) , Japanese ( 44 percent ) , and Americans ( 40 percent ) . Responses from Russians were : Poles ( 60 percent ) , Jews ( 60 percent ) , Japanese ( 51 percent ) , Germans ( 50 percent ) , Englishmen ( 49 percent ) , and Americans ( 49 percent ) ( Source : Polityka , appendix to no. 1 , Prywatyzacja , December 1992 ) . <p> Anna Wolff-Poweska is right in writing that " Arousing anti-European chauvinism , extremists from Russia , Hungary or Poland tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a fortress of de-Christianization and political liberalism identified with moral anarchy , tender pots sic of the Old Continent will be solved " ( Polityka , 7 , 13 February 1993 ) . <p> Attitudes of the Poles toward foreigners are also revealed in Public Opinion Research Centre ( OBOP ) polls of 12-13 October 1992 . A sample of 1,500 individuals were polled . In response to a question on what nationalities were " liked " and " disliked , " Poles reported liking Americans ( 58 percent ) , French ( 55 percent ) , Italians ( 50 percent ) , English ( 41 percent ) , and Hungarians ( 41 percent ) ; and disliking gypsies ( 58 percent ) , Ukrainians ( 35 percent ) , Romanians ( 34 percent ) , Germans ( 31 percent ) , and Arabs ( 31 percent ) ( Source : Rzeczpospolita , 267 , 13 November 1992 ) . <p> It is clear from the poll results that Poles have positive feelings toward nations traditionally thought to be Poland 's allies and usually ones situated far from the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 69 percent to 58 percent , and those who like Englishmen from 50 percent to 41 percent . <p> Those nationalities that have started to look for shelter in Poland , for which Poland has become " the West , " are welcomed less favorably . Dislike of them stays on a relatively steady level with a slight increase for the Romanians , the Lithuanians , and Jews . Dislike of neighboring states is higher . Research shows also that states seen as the most friendly to Poland are the United States ( 67 percent ) , France ( 64 percent ) , Italy , Hungary , and England . The polls also show that dislike for Poland was perceived from Germany ( 37 percent ) , Ukraine ( 35 percent ) , Lithuania ( 33 percent ) , and Cuba ( 26 percent ) . <p> The European Union publication Central and Eastern Eurobarorneter and European Dialogue  --  a magazine of European integration  --  published the results of 1994 research on opinions of citizens of six countries that had signed association agreements with the EC : Bulgaria , Czechoslovakia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The following questions and responses were reported : " Is your country heading in a proper direction ? " Fifty-one percent of all respondents answered no ; 31 percent yes . Polish answers were 52 percent no and 22 percent yes . To the question , " Is market economy good or bad ? " 52 percent said good ; 27 percent bad ; the Poles  --  49 percent good and 23 percent bad . " Is economic reform being introduced too fast or too slowly ? " Forty-six percent considered it too slow ; 15 percent too fast . In Poland , 45 percent said too slow , and 15 percent too fast ; 6 percent said there was no reform . " Are you satisfied with the progresses of democracy ? " Sixty-seven percent were satisfied ; 25 percent were not . In Poland 63 percent were satisfied , and 23 percent were not . " Are human rights observed in your country ? " Fifty-five percent said no ; 38 percent said yes . The Poles answered 59 percent no and 30 percent yes . " Who will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Union , or both in the same extent ? " Native countries were selected by 17 percent of all respondents , the Union by 21 percent , and " both in the same extent " was chosen by 39 percent . In Poland , the responses were 14 percent , 21 percent , and 35 percent , respectively . " What is your opinion about aims and activities of the European Union ? " Positive opinions were expressed by 41 percent , negative by 7 percent , and neutral by 27 percent . In Poland responses were 42 percent , 7 percent , and 25 percent , respectively . " Which social groups will win or lose through enlarging the European Union ? " Private business was predicted to gain by 76 percent ; to lose by 6 percent ; and 6 percent did not answer ; state enterprises : 43 percent , 30 percent , and 8 percent ; state administration workers : 34 percent , 20 percent , and 23 percent ; people with low income : 28 percent , 25 percent , and 19 percent ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent . <p> These outcomes show that businessmen are supposed to be the most pleased and farmers the least pleased with European Union membership . <p> According to Hans van den Broeke , who dealt with associated states in the European Union , support for European integration has been decreasing for the last five years for two reasons : significant delay in the admission of new countries to the Union and , at the same time , a deluge of positive declarations , together with the cost of reforms already experienced in post-socialist countries : unemployment , insolvency of many enterprises , and a severe increase in prices of many goods . This observation also applies in relation to Poland . <p> The question of sovereignty is one of the obstacles to integration . There are people in Poland who understand sovereignty a historically and do not see a growing interdependence of states and nations . They perceive the European integration process as a threat to Polish sovereignty . The necessity for adjustment of the national legal system to the legal system of the European Community is seen as an attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national identity in the European or even the Atlantic culture is another issue . There is a problem of reconciling Poland 's cultural heritage with European universalism . It is not commonly realized that all nations have an opportunity to present to others the output of their own culture and to enrich their culture with values recognized and built up by other European nations . Such mutual understanding and enrichment effectively abolishes hostility , dislike , and strangeness between nations . It is essential for overcoming intolerance toward people thinking in different ways , people of other nations , religions , races , and customs . <p> The fall of totalitarian authority did not mean the end of trouble . The phenomena of nationalism , anti-Semitism , religious fundamentalism , and nostalgia for authoritarian power are still present . Adam Michnik said that " communism was a genius ideology : it was able to give a few simple answers for all complex questions of our time . We declined communism but the temptation of looking for easy explanations of the most complicated problems has remained in all of us " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ralf Dahrendorf wrote that <p> history is being started right now . . . at the end of this century the problem of re-definition of progressive policy assumed cosmic proportions . The idea of living in an open society , free from any ideology begins finally to clear its way in the European culture . . . . The idea that a government should be a gigantic supplier of services belongs to the past . It used to be the key idea of social democracy . Western societies must make three great strategic decisions : First , slimmed government with limited competences ; second , strong civic society rich in autonomous associations ; third , animation of social sensitivity in each sphere of collective life . ( L'Espresso , 22 March 1992 ) <p> Of course , those problems are seen in societies of Western Europe . They are sharper in societies of Eastern Europe . Where is Poland ? Data from the World Competitiveness Report of 1994 showed that of forty-one states , Poland is forty-first in competitiveness , thirty-seventh in computer skills , thirty-fifty in scientific and technological potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of new students at universities . <p> Generally , Poland placed twenty-sixth , worse than Czechoslovakia ( 23 ) , but better than Hungary ( 30 ) . These three countries represented the region of middle-east Europe in the survey . <p> In February 1995 , the PAN " Committee of Prognosis  --  Poland in the 21st Century ' " announced a report , " Way to 2010 . " It is supposed to serve the state 's authorities in preparing development strategy for Poland in the next fifteen years . This period includes Poland 's admittance into the European Union . Our country , according to this report , has the following " trumps " that can be contributed to the European Union : intellectual potential , human resources , and existing scientific structures ( The distance separating Poland from Western countries in the field of science and education is much smaller than in industry and agriculture. ) a consumer market of about forty million its location on the important east-west and north-south transportation routes natural complexes ( forests and lakes ) attractive to tourists low labor costs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry , the cost is US$ 2.7 per hour , as against US$23 in Germany and Sweden . This encouraged Western businessmen to invest in Poland . But so far , the share of foreign capital is only 6 percent . ) <p> Besides " trumps , " there are also obstacles in the way of Poland 's membership in the European Union , such as low working capacity in comparison with Western countries ; high unemployment ( 16 percent ) , a hard problem to solve because by 2010 , 40 percent of the increase in the labor force in Europe will take place in Poland ; a wide sphere of poverty , about 40 percent ; GDP per capita will reach in about 45 percent of an average for European Union countries by 2010 ; rapid growth of pathologies of various kinds ( robberies , murders , drugs , alcoholism , nicotinism ) ; instability of the political system , especially at the level of the supreme powers in the state ( relationships between the president , government , and Parliament ) ; a high level of ecological dangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of education must enable a person to cope with the challenge of competitive powers , free market economy , and international competition . <p> In Poland , the danger of domination by the " haves " over the life of citizens is noticed . This involves the spiritual and cultural value of all human beings , which must be ensured by the high range of cultural life and by state respect for the development of culture and morals in the society . <p> After 1989 , there was hope that Poland would become a member of the EEC very soon . Because this did not happen and the West has held itself aloof , fear that Poland might be a secondary member has been growing . Considering its area and population , Poland can be one of the medium-sized states of the European Union ; however , economic potential would situate Poland at one of the last places . GDP per capita in Poland is equal to half of the GDP in the weakest states of the EU  --  Greece and Portugal  --  and only to one fourth of the GDP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of oil per $US 1,000 of GDP ) testifies to the technological delay of Poland ; the average number in the European states is about 220 kilograms , when in Poland it is 700 kilograms . Environment pollution in Poland is several times higher than in the European Union countries . <p> Poland is also below all member states in national income per capita . Denmark and Germany have four times higher income , and Greece and Portugal  --  occupying last position  --  have an income twice as high as Poland 's . <p> It will take a long time for Poland to reach the European Union level of economic development . This might create a danger of Poland taking a position as a sort of appendix to the European Union , serving it with exports of raw materials and cheap labor , and as a market for the more developed European states . <p> As Wojciech Kostecki wrote : <p> The European Union is using consciously the economic and political dependence of East-Middle Europe . If you want membership and the profits connected with it , you have to regulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outbreak of new conflicts similar to the war in former Yugoslavia . Stability treaty is only one of the undertakings using the attractiveness of economic resources of the Union and its collective institutions . It does not guarantee anything but has been thought out as a condition sine qua non of a potential extension of the Union towards the East . The same role is played by association treaties and declarations of consecutive " summits " : we do not say " no " but you have still to wait for " yes . " All together we have the situation described by one Western expert as " admitting guests to the table as slowly as possible . " ( Przeglad Tygodnniowy , 12 , 13 March 1995 ) <p> One of the limitations in thinking about the integration of Poland with European structures is the focus of politicians and the mass media on internal problems of the country . It is not considered that in the contemporary world , tendencies toward larger integrative structures such as the EU , CEFTA , NAFTA , EFTA , ASEAN , and the like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensured only in cooperation with larger economic and political structures . It is particularly important for Poland , which is backward in its development in comparison with west European countries . Meanwhile , the attention of public opinion is focused on past events , not future . Immoderate hopes and expectations of change have not become real . The Solidarity trade union had patronized rebuilding an independent Poland , but three million are unemployed , there is fear of an uncertain tomorrow , and social achievements are lower . Hopes for quick development of civic society did not materialize . The old division into " us " ( society ) and " them " ( authorities ) is still alive despite changing the system to a democratic one . The long lasting belief that it is " they " who give " us " everything is continuously present . The society in mass is passive . Yet it will not be " they " who solve citizens ' problems , but citizens themselves who must change their attitudes and shape their own lives . Self-government of social groups , including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lack of thinking about the closest circle , it is difficult to expect thinking about complex problems of European integration and the place of Poland within it . <p> The states of unifying Europe are not free from fears and doubts evoked by new tasks indicated by the Maastricht Treaty . Those challenges loom especially large for those countries that are waiting to be included among the members of the European Union . If all fears are reduced to a common denominator , then it is the necessity to limit the sovereignty of member states , as was mentioned by Klaus Kinkel in Die Zeit ( 10 March 1995 ) : Most decisions of the European Union are made in Brussels . " Brussels decisions often evoke political . . . doubts , especially when their democratic control seems to be insufficient , " Kinkel wrote . That is why , he argued , " we want decisions of the EU more clear and closer to a man . Above all we have to consider more than we used to political cares and fears of citizens : nobody can deprive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Motherlands being a guarantor of their identity and their styles of life . " A more precise division of competences between the European Union and certain member states is needed . " It must be clear , " Kinkel said , " that Brussels interferences end where specific problems can be solved on the national or regional level . " This is not easy , because no country is able to solve complex present and future problems alone . Europe must define its own interests in the face of competition with the United States and Japan . The efficiency of acting depends on relations between discussion and the tempo of decisionmaking . Kinkel says : " The European Union as a whole should make discussion easier . That is why we have to specify clearly those problems which should be decided by qualified majority . . . . Majority decision in international policy can not be treated as taboo any longer . Those who agree should honestly add : I am for majority decisions even when opinions of the majority are not mine . " This may be one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereignty limitation . Growth of organized crime in Europe raises the urgent necessity for European police  --  the Europol . Kinkel says , " We need a European FBI . People rightly expect rapid progress on that issue . " National structures for fighting criminality , even with the help of Interpol , are not nearly enough . That is also a matter of sovereignty . Extension of European Union membership from the original six to fifteen today poses a question of the function of a large bureaucratic apparatus . There is need for redefinition of frames and mechanisms of activities of the Commission , the Council of Ministers , and the European Parliament . As Kinkel argues , " Thinking in categories of national prestige must be replaced by the necessity of effectiveness of the European institutions . In growing , the Community influence and importance of particular members are changing  --  both bigger and small . Anyway , it is justified price for a bigger Europe which consciously and with due attention represents its interests in the international forum . " <p> There are different possibilities for defining relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority of small ones . Will there arise something like a " narrow administration " with a decisive voice similar to the UN Security Council ? Much discussion is needed to reach compromises to prevent future crises and counteract decentralizing tendencies . <p> There are other fears and obstacles on Poland 's way to the European Union , such as the weakness of Polish democracy . Permanent quarrels and discords and disrespect for the results of democratic elections could lead to destabilization and weakening of state authority . An example is the " war " waged by the president with Parliament and the government . In Poland it is called " war at the top . " It is thought that the new authorities are not interested in the lives of average people because they are more concerned about their own interests . Such an opinion is strengthened by the frequent change of governing parties , charging one another with various blameworthy acts . <p> Is it possible to introduce a democratic system into a country without democratic traditions ? Many difficulties encumber the process of socioeconomic and political transformation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and economically backward . Low living standards prevail among 40 percent to 50 percent of the population . About nine million pensioners and annuitants subsist on a low income , but wield great electoral power . Political apathy , passiveness in social life , and low level of political culture prevail . The fundamental transformation from a centrally planned , state economy to a market economy itself creates social problems . <p> As Poland approaches joining the European Union , its whole economy must in a short time adjust itself to European standards and reach the ability to undertake economic competition . This will be particularly difficult for Polish agriculture . The process of economic reconstruction is taking place under circumstances of about three million unemployed and growing stratification of wealth , conditions creating dissatisfaction among great numbers of citizens . The complexity of political , economic , and social conditions complicates efforts to win citizen support for the transformations taking place in Poland . Yet parliamentary democracy must be based on wide participation in decisionmaking about the direction , tempo , and form of changes . <p> In Poland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A parliamentary system based on free elections has been introduced . The system of territorial self-government has been expanding ; numerous political parties , trade unions , and nongovernmental social organizations have formed . The mass media are free and act without any censorship . Rights of national minorities are more respected now . <p> There are ongoing discussions about the extent of the free market economy and democratic system . Most prefer parallel development of both of those key spheres of life . Against a background of an unstabilized political and economic situation , there is a danger of authoritarian resurgence . Some citizens believe that a strong leadership might be a solution for all problems . <p> Some prominent circles of the Roman Catholic Church express concern about threats from the Western model of life to the spirituality and religion of Poles . Pope John Paul II has stated his opinion many times . On 9 November 1982 , ending his visit to Spain , he said : <p> I can not leave the crisis situation of the Continent on the threshold of the third millennium of Christianity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as religious . . . . Secular life is also marked with the consequences of secular ideology , consequences which lead from the negation of God or restriction of religious freedoms toward giving too much importance to economic success above the human value of work and production ; from materialism and hedonism , which threaten values of a fecund and united family . . . and moral care of youth toward nihilism weakening the willingness to face such key problems as poverty , emigration , the situation of national and religious minorities , and terrorism . <p> A year earlier , in 1981 , the Pope said : " We live in a Europe in which the temptation of atheism and skepticism becomes stronger and stronger , where moral uncertainty grows , combined with disintegration of the family and slackness of morals , where dangerous conflicts of ideas and movements rule . " <p> In church circles , a critical attitude exists . Professor J. Tischner wrote : " What is a demon of our world ? It is liberalism . What is liberalism ? It is not discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a freedom as a possibility to go astray , to turn away from God " ( Tygodnik Powszechny , 21 , 22 May 1994 ) . <p> Pope John Paul II , in his speech to Polish bishops on 15 January 1993 , said : <p> Polish people must be strong today to reject the wave of demoralization which comes to us under a cover of modernity and liberation . The so-called entering of Europe can not be reached at the cost of giving up the rights of healthy consciousness in the name of wrongly understood tolerance and pluralism . It would mean voluntary surrender to a new form of totalitarian constraint  --  more dangerous as voluntarily accepted . . . . The Church must remind that market rules themselves are not enough . Moreover , they turn against a man when he forgets about moral obligations which are more basic than economic rules . <p> In the Catholic press , one can find attacks on those who believe that international law is a basis of European integration and European unity . According to K. Pomian , the evangelization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to restore and strengthen Catholicism in Europe . Other religions are not passive about such intentions . A wave of criticism from the Catholic Church was evoked by the European Parliament resolution favoring conjugal and adoption rights for homosexuals . Critical comments on the spiritual crisis in Europe formulated by believers and the Catholic clergy in Poland cause fears of imposition of the Polish model of Catholicism in Europe . <p> In Tygodnik Powszechny , a Catholic center oriented weekly , Jerzy Turowicz published an article characteristically titled " Do n't Be Afraid of the Integration " ( 7 February 1993 ) . That article was an attack on those national Catholics who are afraid of integration : " On our political stage the term ' European ' is nowadays often used in a pejorative sense . . . . It is difficult to estimate whether it is stupidity or simply cynicism . " Turowicz said also that <p> in the West we have to deal with the sharp crisis of the value hierarchy , with relativism towards truth . . . . The great pull of the West European economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people 's attitudes and mentality , a materialism often seen as more dangerous than the dialectical Marxist one . The economic situation of the West creates what we see as civilization and a consumption mentality , with the domination  --  as stressed several times by John Paul II  --  of " have " above " be . " . . . integration opponents conclude that we should defend ourselves , that we should preserve our own values and identity , and even that we have some mission to fulfill to West Europe , that we should bring there Christian values . <p> While discussion of the ratification of an association treaty between Poland and the EEC was going on in the Seym , Euroregions in Poland met Catholic critics from the Christian National Union . One of them simply said that Euroregions " is an idea for the partitioning of Poland " and that there was " a plan to dissolve borders . " The thesis that Euroregions are a way of interference in the territorial integrity of Poland means that these opponents do not understand the basic assumptions of Euroregions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the author of a book titled Fight for Poland ( Warszawa , 1993 ) , decidedly against European integration , wrote , " There are very serious threats connected with economic and political integration with West Europe 7-8 . Unsuccessful mirages of the united Europe are replaced by the concept of Euroregions , promoted by proponents of loss of Poland 's identity , who do not need the Motherland because they have their capital in Brussels " ( 137 ) . <p> There is little understanding of the ideas , aims , and benefits of European unification . Knowledge is superficial and simplified . Political education , already in a weak condition , faces a great challenge . <p> By CZESLAW MOJSIEWICZ <p> <p> Czeslaw Mojsiewicz is a professor of international relations at Adam Mickiewicz University , Poznan , Poland . <p>
