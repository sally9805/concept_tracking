Something in the Baton Rouge air must make politicians go partway round the bend . Before their latest session ended , the state legislators pressed every hot-button issue within reach . They not only passed the strictest anti- abortion law adopted by any state since Roe v. Wade but almost passed a measure to encourage the beating of flag burners by reducing the penalty to a $25 fine . Then they approved a law requiring record companies to place warning labels on songs that promote deviant sex , violence , drug abuse , suicide , devil worship or incest . <P> Thus Governor Buddy Roemer inherited some worthy opportunities for the veto . He used it on the abortion ban last week only days after thumbing down the lewd-lyrics law on the ground that it violated free-speech protections . The legislators may return to the capital Aug. 18 to consider whether to override the vetoes.
