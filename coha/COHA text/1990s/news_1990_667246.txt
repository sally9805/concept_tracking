<p> Lights ! Cameras ! Annuities ! And hold the onions . <p> Former actors spout financial data . One-time waiters and waitresses take orders for deposits and withdrawals . <p> Welcome to a New York bank 's radical vision of the future - as well as its strategy for survival in today 's hypercompetitive market . DollarDryDock Savings Bank is out to prove that it has a better set of goods to offer than , say , $ 234 billion-asset CitiCorp or $ 106 billion-asset Chase Manhattan . It 's a life-or-death battle with no clear winners yet . More than 200 other banks are clawing for customers in the New York metro area . And souring real-estate loans have been devouring everyone 's profits . <p> How does a $ 4.7 billion dwarf get noticed by consumers in the land of the giants ? By selling dozens of additional products permitted by its state savings-bank charter - like insurance , mutual funds and travel services - and doing it the chic way that Bloomingdale 's sells fashions . All 23 DollarDryDock branches look like boutiques : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the old days . Service is king . <p> " Before , it was n't a friendly environment , " says Linda Lockhart , a Cornell University MBA and former buyer of intimate apparel for Bloomie 's who taught DDD 's bankers the art of selling . <p> Lockhart - DDD 's highest-ranking female as senior vice president of marketing - splashed branches with purple , teal and red to create a more relaxing climate . She substituted fast-food-style formica counters and product kiosks for the somber wood desks found in most banks . <p> Chic stores need polished sales people . So Lockhart hired and trained former actors and actresses - such as 6-foot-7 Satish Chandra ( he played a pathologist and other characters on Miami Vice ) and Sue Paek ( she played a spider woman in the horror movie Spooky ) as product-information officers . Like characters in a commercial , they know how to appeal to customers and be charming and instructive at the same time . Lockhart hired one-time waiters and waitresses to be tellers because they know how to better listen to customers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach to banking because she was recruited by Chairman Robert Steele , who also has a non- traditional banking background . He views it as a plus . Steele 's former occupations : CIA agent , financial analyst , congressman , gubernatorial candidate . He told Lockhart : Make my bank user-friendly . In fact , Steele suggested the department-store motif . <p> DDD branches are designed to be eye-catching , theatrical and fun places to visit . They also are meant to be useful . Steele brags that visitors can find most of the daily financial information they need inside DDD 's doors . TVs suspended from the ceilings constantly play tapes educating customers about topics like car loans or annuities . Huge digital displays provide up-to-the- minute financial-markets data and news headlines . And , occasionally , a mime or a singer highlights CD rates or a new travel or loan product . <p> If all of this sounds a little bit New York crazy , then the world is chock full of nuts . People from around the globe are taking notice and even copying DDD . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And bankers from 29 other countries have visited the bank since it started introducing the changes in 1985 . So many curious bankers began parading through the branches , DDD had to start charging a fee . Tour prices have ranged from $ 2,500 for two bankers to $ 7,500 for a group of 60 . The rush of curious bankers convinced Steele to go into business on his own as a consultant , effective next Monday . He 'll remain a DDD director . <p> Steele claims the marketing strategy has been a big success . For example , the bank is projecting an increase of 19,000 accounts this year , vs. 1,000 new accounts in 1985 . <p> In fact , if DDD had n't lost $ 4.6 million because of souring commercial real-estate loans during the first nine months of this year , the bank would be weathering the current economic storm just fine . Instead , DDD , which is privately held by some pension funds and venture capitalists , is selling two branches to Chase - and farming out data processing to Mellon bank to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Real estate - that 's a whole other side of the business , " says Steele . These days , he prefers to talk about his marketing . Long term , that 's what will make or break the bank , regardless of real estate . <p> " Not having been trained as a banker , I take the customer 's point of view . I see things that bankers do n't see . I drive the people in our branches crazy , " says Steele , who started his career as a Soviet and South American specialist at the CIA in 1963 . <p> In fact , he speaks Russian and Spanish so well , he 's done DDD commericials in those languages aimed at New York 's ethnic communities . <p> Steele left the spy business in 1968 and became a securities analyst for The Travelers Insurance Co. in Connecticut . Two years later , he won a seat in Congress as a Republican . He stepped down in 1974 after two terms and ran for Connecticut governor . He lost , quit politics and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steele helped turn the bank around . The feat did n't go unnoticed . He was recruited in 1982 to help revitalize struggling DryDock Savings Bank . The bank merged with Dollar the following year . <p> " Banking service in New York was terrible , " recalls Steele . " It was far worse in terms of responsiveness than anywhere else . " <p> He decided to make his bank more amiable . But how ? Enlightenment came one morning when he entered DDD 's main office , across from Bloomingdale 's . " The building had been dedicated in 1937 , the year before I was born , " Steele says . " The more I looked around at its vaulted ceilings , slate floors and long lines , I realized there really had n't been any changes at the bank since then . " That 's when he transformed DDD into a financial department store . <p> What 's left to be done ? Make lines shorter .
