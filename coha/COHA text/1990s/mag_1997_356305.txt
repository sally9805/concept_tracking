One day in March 1989 , long after Madalyn Murray O'Hair dropped from fame but before she dropped from sight , she enjoyed one of the sweet contradictions of life as America 's foremost atheist : she played the preacher at Scott Kerns ' wedding . Kerns was something of a favorite of O'Hair 's ; for a while he led the Texas chapter of her American Atheists group . And so Madalyn invited the couple up to her handsome tan shingle house on Greystone Drive in Austin . The event took place in the library , and was attended by friends , a photographer and Madalyn 's son Jon Murray and granddaughter Robin Murray-O'Hair , from whom Madalyn was inseparable . " She took the ceremony very seriously , " says Kerns . In Texas justices of the peace are likely to slip a " God " or even a " Jesus " into an otherwise civil service ; to avoid such sabotage , O'Hair had obtained certification to perform marriages . She now pronounced the couple man and wife . It was a lovely moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by one of O'Hair 's several ill-tempered little dogs . Afterward , he says , " there was music and champagne , and we went out to dinner . And Madalyn . Madalyn is funny . She 's the funniest person on earth . " He pauses . " If she 's still on earth . " <P> " If Dean Koontz and Stephen King sat down with a bottle of Scotch and tried to figure out the most bizarre ending to this family they could , " says William Murray , Madalyn O'Hair 's estranged older son , the one who converted to Christianity , " whatever really happened was probably more bizarre than that . " Hyperbole is a Murray-O'Hair family trait , but the assessment is not totally astray . One day in August 1995 , Madalyn , then 76 , along with Jon , 40 , and Robin , 30 , vanished from the house on Greystone Drive , reportedly with breakfast still cooking , and were never seen again .

After a decade of infamy and two more in a slide toward obscurity , Madalyn Murray O'Hair , by her absence , has managed to grab the spotlight again . <P> The public saga of Madalyn Murray O'Hair began in June 1963 , when the U.S. Supreme Court removed prayer from the public schools . The suit on which the decision was primarily based had been brought by a Philadelphia Unitarian named Ed Schempp . But it soon became apparent that a secondary litigant , whose case had merely been attached to Schempp 's , was the one who most desperately wanted the mantle of the era 's foremost separator of church and state .
