It 's enough to make the most gregarious gabber think twice before picking up the phone again . What if the record of all your personal calls  --  whom you 're talking to , when and for how long  --  were being sold to the highest bidder , by none other than your very own telephone company ? Every time you dial up your shrink for a quick calm-me-down , for instance , that history could be sold to a pharmaceutical firm ready to pitch you on the benefits of tranquilizers . <P> A telemarketing nightmare , perhaps . But if a recent federal court decision is any guide , that kind of invasion of privacy could become policy , at least according to an outraged William Kennard , chairman of the Federal Communications Commission . Last week the FCC noisily announced that it would appeal a 10th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling , handed down in Denver , two weeks ago , that it claims gives telephone companies the right to peddle data on customers to a third party without their permission . " We tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kennard . " But what we have today is nothing more than a fig leaf . " <P> Although the case involved a phone company 's effort to broaden its right to circulate information among its own divisions , the decision hit a raw nerve  --  the one that jangles with every telemarketing call . True , all manner of corporations are already trading your personal details in an estimated $3 billion-a-year data market . Most websites are collecting your browsing preferences on the sly , many banks are selling account records on the open market , and sensitive medical files remain vulnerable to snooping . " Americans have little clue about what happens to their personal information , " says John Featherman , president of Privacy Protectors , a consumer-consulting firm . <P> But as people start to realize what 's going on , more and more of them are wondering if any part of their personal lives is off-limits . That 's one reason the FCC is objecting so loudly . As part of the 1996 Telecommunications Act , the FCC established strict " opt-in " privacy provisions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his calling data can be made part of marketing campaigns for additional services or products . Not surprisingly , the telcos and other businesses prefer the " opt-out " approach , which costs less and bears more fruit . It gives companies the right to exchange the valuable information  --  both internally and with third parties  --  unless consumers expressly forbid it . <P> The plaintiff , U S West , argued successfully that the more burdensome opt-in method was an abridgment of its First Amendment right to free commercial speech . In a 2-to-1 decision , the appeals panel wrote , " Although we may feel uncomfortable knowing that our personal information is circulating in the world , we live in an open society where information may usually pass freely . " <P> Many privacy advocates are worried that the ruling could set a bad precedent for all kinds of privacy protections . " The court in the Denver case does n't think privacy alone is enough , " notes Deirdre Mulligan , staff counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology . " They think an invasion of privacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can intervene .
