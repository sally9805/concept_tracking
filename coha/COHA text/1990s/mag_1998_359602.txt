CAMPAIGN NOTES FROM FAR AND WIDE <P> DEAD WOMAN RUNNING Jacquelyn Ledgerwood photo 1 , a Democratic candidate for Senate in Oklahoma , died before the primary . Even dead , she was a popular lady , taking 25% of the vote and forcing a runoff against air conditioner repairman Don E. Carroll . But Carroll may not prove the most fiery challenger . " I do have to work some , " complains Carroll . " I have to eat ; you know how that is . The mortgage is still due . I have to pay insurance . " Republican incumbent Don Nickles can keep cool . <P> CROSSFIRE CURSE Why did Geraldine Ferraro 2 , who entered the New York Democratic Senate primary with a 25-point lead , suffer a 25-point loss to Representative Chuck Schumer ? Maybe it 's the Crossfire curse . Evidence : two-time presidential contender Pat Buchanan also lost his races dismally , taking 22% of the vote . Stay where you are , John Sununu . <P> MY THREE SONS On TV it was Mike , Robbie and Chip . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Skip  --  as in Mike Freeman , son of former Governor Orville ; Ted Mondale , son of former Vice President Walter ; and Skip Humphrey 3 , son of former Vice President Hubert . Skip won . He 'll face Republican Norm Coleman and Reform candidate Jesse ( " the Body " ) Ventura . <P> GIM ME A HAND Tip O'Neill famously said that all politics is local . Proving that point , Somerville mayor Michael Capuano 4 won the Democratic primary for O'Neill 's old House seat ( once also held by J.F.K. ) , swaying voters with aggressive campaigning . That tactic was better than that of his closest competition , former Boston mayor and Vatican ambassador Ray Flynn , who showed pictures of himself with the Pope and Mother Teresa . <P> SO LONG , SISTERHOOD Representative Linda Smith 5 won the Washington State Republican Senate primary , and will face Democratic incumbent Patty Murray , making theirs the only Senate race with female opponents . The mud is expected to fly over women 's rights . Smith says she is antifeminist : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone . " <P> PARDON ME , BUT ... <P> We 've heard a lot of excuses this past month , but how good have they been ? We grade some . <P> BILL CLINTON : " This matter is between me ... my wife and our daughter ... It 's nobody 's business but ours . " <P> Remark : As if ! Grade : D <P> HENRY HYDE : " The statute of limitations has long since passed on my youthful indiscretions . " <P> Remark : Hank  --  you were in your 40s ! Grade : C <P> HELEN CHENOWETH : " I made a mistake ; I acknowledged that mistake ... I asked forgiveness . And I have moved on . " <P> Remark : But her ex-lover 's wife has n't forgiven her . Grade : B- <P> WILLIAM KRISTOL : " Republicans have old-fashioned extramarital affairs with other adults . Those really are moral lapses that are private and more easily forgiven and very different from taking advantage of a young person who works for you when you 're President . " <P> Remark : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oriented . Grade : D <P> JAMES CARVILLE : " To paraphrase Dante , the hot-blooded shall be judged very differently from the coldhearted . " <P> Remark : James , have you met the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee ? Grade : F <P> TOPIC A <P> NOT ASA AGAIN ! <P> Name : Asa Hutchinson
