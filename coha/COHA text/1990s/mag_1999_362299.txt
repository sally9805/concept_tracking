Zahi Hawass never thought he 'd be working anywhere but at the pyramids and thereabouts , where he has worked for more than 20 years and where plenty remains to be discovered . Then , three years ago , the eminent archaeologist , who also serves as Egypt 's Undersecretary of State for the Giza Monuments , got wind of a new , unsuspected burial site at the Bahariya Oasis , some 230 miles southwest of Cairo . When he arrived , recalls Hawass , " one of the tomb ceilings had fallen in and the sun shone through it . I went in and looked at the mummies in the rays of the sun . All I could see was gold . " <P> Astonished by that first glimpse , Hawass returned last spring to lead what he calls the largest expedition ever undertaken in Egypt  --  and deservedly so . The richness of the find and the tombs ' unprecedented state of preservation have astounded archaeologists , some of whom have compared it to the discovery of King Tut 's tomb in 1922 . Even Tut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These tombs appear to have remained undisturbed since they were sealed some 2,000 years ago  --  more than 1,300 years after Tut , at a time when Egypt and much of the Middle East was part of the Roman Empire . <P> So far , Hawass 's team has explored four tombs , with a total of 105 mummies laid on top of one another in neat stacks . All told , the remains were interred in four distinct ways . One type was covered with a thin layer of gold . Another lay under lifelike masks made of plaster-coated linen , or cartonnage , that was painted with scenes of ancient Egyptian gods and goddesses , including Isis , Osiris , Horus and Anubis . Still others were placed in so-called anthropoid coffins  --  pottery sarcophagi with human faces  --  and a few were only wrapped in linen . Bracelets , amulets , statues of mourning ladies , pottery vessels and figurines of Bes , whom Hawass describes as " the dwarf god of pleasure and fun , " were interred with the bodies . <P> It is n't surprising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accoutrements have both Egyptian and Roman characteristics : the hairstyles on the anthropoid coffins are Roman , but the style of decoration is Egyptian . The richness of the tomb decorations , Hawass notes , indicates that the inhabitants of Bahariya were prosperous . Indeed , the city flourished on its renowned wine , made from dates and grapes , which it exported throughout the Nile Valley . <P> Impressive as the discoveries have been , they are just the beginning . Hawass estimates that the cemetery covers several square miles and may contain up to 10,000 mummies . The section now being excavated , he believes , belonged to the middle class ; eventually , tombs of wealthier people may turn up . And once this huge and pristine site is fully explored , Hawass and his colleagues expect to have an unprecedented window into Egyptian life in a provincial town under Roman rule .
