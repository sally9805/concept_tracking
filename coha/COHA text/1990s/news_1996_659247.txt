" ' said Robin Hoffman , 30 , who spent several minutes circling . <p> Wawa Inc. , a family dairy outside Philadelphia that grew into a five-state empire of convenience stores , has drawn people like Hoffman by redefining the business . <p> Kiwi and tomatoes , mineral water and pasta salad , cappuccino and yogurt are available next to the usual cookies , candy bars and cheese dip at Wawa 's 515 stores , all in the Northeast . <p> Wawa has added Taco Bell burritos and Pizza Hut personal pan pizzas to the more standard deli sandwiches . In 1994 , Wawa introduced a downtown Philadelphia store that sells all fast food - no groceries . <p> Industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a maverick that is simultaneously remaking itself in the images of upscale restaurants and fast-food restaurants . <p> " I ca n't tell you how many people visit Wawa just to see what 's going on , " says Maureen Azzato , editor-in-chief of Convenience Store News . " They 're really on the cutting edge . " <p> Wawa 's president and chief executive officer , Richard D. Wood Jr. , has a simple explanation for the success of the chain , which had $ 838 million in sales last year . <p> " We have always had in our mission statement either the words perishable or fresh , " he said , sitting in his corporate headquarters on his family 's old summer estate . <p> Fresh and convenient have n't exactly been compatible terms in an industry where the three biggest-selling items are gasoline , tobacco and beer . <p> The hard-core convenience store shopper used to be a man 18 to 34 years old " who draws much of his daily sustenance from the six major food groups - sugar , fat , salt , caffeine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managing partner of Management Horizons , a Columbus , Ohio , consulting firm that tracks convenience stores . <p> Lindsay Hutter , spokeswoman for the National Association of Convenience Stores in Alexandria , Va. , calls that customer " Bubba . " <p> " Bubba has been very good to the convenience store industry , and we valued his business , " she said . <p> But , she said , the $ 6.7 billion industry , which encompasses 93,000 stores , has exhausted the market and needs to reach out more to women , who are " not only more health-conscious , they 're more upscale in their taste . " <p> Take Hoffman , of Merchantville , N.J. , cradling a green salad and an iced tea under her arm inside Wawa 's Tinicum superstore . <p> " It 's more like grocery food , " said Hoffman , who drove from a nearby industrial park where she works .

His grandfather George , who owned a textile mill in New Jersey , had built the dairy at the summer retreat he bought in 1890 in Wawa , Pa . <p> Wawa - the Lenni Lenape Indian word for goose - was the perfect name for his company . And a goose is part of its logo . <p> With brandname milk , butter and ice cream , the one store became three by the end of the year , 40 in four years , 80 two years after that . At one time , Richard Wood said he wanted to expand to 1,000 stores by 2000 but now wants bigger stores instead . <p> The company went through many changes , experimenting with fast food , adding and abandoning gasoline , entering and leaving the New York City market . " Too expensive , " Wood said . <p> The chain 's biggest success may be coffee . Wawa 's own special blend is its hottest ready-to-serve product , attracting customers from truck drivers to yuppies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ espresso bars . <p> But the biggest buzz words in Wawa corporate culture today are Taco Bell and Pizza Hut . The idea , managers say , is to come full circle , transforming once again into the store that has everything , including hot meals . <p> " They 've learned a lot from restaurants . That 's who they 've looked at for their operation , not c-stores , and that 's why they 're excelling , " said Azzato , of the Convenience Store News . <p> Apparently other chains are watching . 7-Eleven is introducing a " Deli Central " line of hot meals , sandwiches and fruit salads , said Karen Raskopf , spokeswoman for its parent company , Southland Corp .

" <p> BLOCK 2 <p> Headline : Japan has a high-tech take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> TEXT : <p> By PETER LANDERS <p> Associated Press Writer <p> TOKYO ( AP ) - It offers the services of a post office , a bank , a bookstore and a ticket agency . It also sells snacks . <p> The fluorescent glare and the " Open 24 Hours " sign may look familiar , but Japanese convenience stores have blended a unique native element - high technology - into the classic American invention . <p> Japan caught on relatively late to the convenience store , but it 's making up for lost time . The growth has been phenomenal : from 1,000 stores in 1974 to 47,000 now , with the figure increasing by 1,500 every year . <p> Computers are the secret of their success , controlling distribution , tracking even tiny changes in customer demand and making possible all the services that get customers into the store . <p> " Of all the industries in Japan , convenience stores are the one where the use of computers is most deeply rooted , " said Taizo Deguchi , a retail industry analyst at the Daiwa Research Institute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're known here , has a central computer system that receives data on every purchase , including the customer 's gender and estimated age . Combini owners check sales data and make orders through the computer . <p> The technology enables chain managers to make virtually instant decisions on products . Say a new brand of potato chips goes on sale . Product buyers watch its sales on a day-by-day , even hour-by-hour basis . If it 's not a success after two weeks , they yank it . <p> Suppliers get access as well . If soft drink sales are booming , beverage makers find out right away , so they can boost production to keep up . <p> But the merchandise is only half the story . The combini is also a place to send packages , pay bills , make photocopies , and in many cases , to buy concert and event tickets . <p> In the past few months some stores have even installed plane ticket machines , enabling customers to reserve a seat and pay for it by credit card . <p> The rise of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't offer high-tech services and in any case have seen their market niche shrink as young Japanese turn away from traditional dishes in favor of junk food and microwaved meals . <p> " In the old days , Japan was full of specialty stores selling fish or vegetables or books , " said Ken Sakurai , 66 , who owns a Tokyo combini with his wife . " But those stores are gradually disappearing . " <p> The Sakurais ' store is typically tiny - only 650 square feet or not much bigger than a large living room . Yet it manages to squeeze in a large variety of instant and fresh foods , daily necessities and an extensive selection of magazines . <p> For big-city dwellers , especially in the Tokyo area , combinis like the Sakurais ' are everywhere . Because the computerized distribution allows them to stock a broader range of products , analysts say Japan can support one combini for every 2,000 people , compared with one per 8,000 in the United States . <p> The fast spread of the combini has proven an engine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulations restricting big stores . <p> Ito-Yokado Co. , Japan 's second-largest supermarket operator , set off the combini boom with its 7-Eleven chain , while the No. 1 Japanese retailer , Daiei , owns the second-ranking Lawson 's combini chain . <p> The customers are predominantly young and male , with tastes that older Japanese find a bit hard to appreciate . <p> Sakurai 's wife , Yasuko , 65 , still ca n't understand how anyone could enjoy " onigiri " rice balls with mayonnaise inside , but they 're a big seller at most combini . <p> " ( Combini ) have invented many new products , and that 's giving them the power to grow and keep high margins , " said Susumu Takeuchi , an analyst at Yamaichi Securities ' research institute . <p> In recent years , elements of the combini strategy have spread back to the United States . In 1990 , Ito-Yokado 's 7-Eleven Japan bought a majority stake in Southland Corp. , which operates 7-Eleven stores in the United States , and returned it to profitability . <p> And this year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But there 's one crucial element in the success of Japanese combini that ca n't be easily exported to the United States : the low crime rate here . In Japan , keeping late hours does n't make retailers and their customers inevitable targets of robbers . <p> " Even at this hour , I can walk on the streets and no one 's going to touch me , " said shopper Ki-dong Lee , leaving a central Tokyo combini as the clock neared 1 a.m. one recent night .
