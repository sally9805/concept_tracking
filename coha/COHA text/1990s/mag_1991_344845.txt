. . . it is only because miners sweat their guts out that superior persons can remain superior . <P>  --  George Orwell , The Road to Wigan Pier <P> Out of work and out of luck , the coal miners of Logan County , W. Va. , come to the Big Eagle Gun and Pawn Shop to offer up the last thing they have of any worth : their simple gold wedding bands . The rings , buffed free of inscriptions , fill a black velvet tray . Dozens more crowd a shelf in the vault . Over the past five years , more than 1,000 miners and their wives have come here to slip off their rings and slide them silently across the narrow glass counter . They walk away with a $15 loan and a claim stub . In time , their rings are shipped in bulk to a smelter in North Carolina , where they are melted down  --  as disposable as they once were valued , not unlike the miners themselves . <P> The store is an inventory of broken dreams . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testimony to the legacy that coal mining has left upon Appalachia : unemployment , a ruined economy , crippling injuries and early deaths . For Logan County  --  and for much of Appalachia  --  coal has been a blessing and a curse . It provided generations with work , solid wages , a source of immense pride and a tax base for schools , hospitals and roads . But the mines have exacted a high price in return . Many miners spend their lives crawling on their hands and knees in tunnels sometimes no higher than a yardstick , wading through mud and water , burrowing through unutterable darkness . Nearly every miner can name a friend or family member who has been killed , maimed or stricken with black lung disease . " You die quick or you die slow , " says Hassell Butcher , chief of Logan County 's tax department . <P> But the casualties of mining can not be measured by injuries alone . Generations of young men were lured from the classroom into the mines , many of them barely able to read or write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diversify . And still they cling to it , with vain hopes that the men will be called back to work . But tens of thousands of mining jobs have been lost as the process of extracting coal from Appalachia 's deep seams has been transformed by cheaper , automated methods and by the development of surface mines in the Western states . Of the 20 most productive mines in the U.S. , not one is in Appalachia . As a result , the number of coal miners in the U.S. has plunged from about 230,000 a decade ago to 130,000 today . <P> As the industry has moved from man to machine , the miners have lost the political and economic clout to defend themselves . Union miners produced less than a third of America 's coal output last year , compared with about 45% a decade ago . Miners claim that the Reagan Administration often favored the coal companies at the miners ' expense , relaxing the severity of penalties for safety violations . Corruption too has taken its toll on inspections . Last week dozens of coal companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they conspired to falsify tests for coal dust , the substance that causes black lung .
