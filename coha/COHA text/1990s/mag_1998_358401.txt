I 'm not a fan . I never root for one team over another because I generally do n't care who wins . But I admit I do feel vindicated by the Princeton University basketball team 's 26-and-1 record and its rank of No. 8 in the country . I confess I would n't be all that disappointed if the team wins a couple of games in the NCAA championships that start this week . But only because it might teach a lesson to the guys I play pickup basketball with on Tuesday nights . <P> I was a scrub , a sophomore backup guard , on the last great Princeton squad , the team that won the National Invitational Tournament in 1975 . I ca n't take much credit for the victory , except that I did occasionally force the first team to work up a sweat in practice , and I did absorb my fair share of the coaches ' abuse . But the real curse of a Princeton basketball education is that it renders you unfit for pickup games for the rest of your life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one sees you when you go backdoor . Guys hog the ball and force shots from 30 feet . My inner coach wants to bench all these Michael Jordan wannabes . But it 's a lost cause . You see such play everywhere these days . Especially in the NBA . <P> The current Princeton team plays exactly the way my team did , with a few new wrinkles and some better athletes . My coach was the ornery philosopher Pete Carril . Princeton 's current coach , Bill Carmody , apprenticed under Carril for 14 years . Carril saw the 94-ft. by 54-ft. hard court as a moral playground where the cardinal virtue was unselfishness . The embodiment of unselfishness was the assist , the small act of grace of giving up the ball to a teammate who has a better shot . Check out the box score of a Princeton game : the team gets two-thirds of its baskets off assists , a rarity in this era of run-and-gun shooters who have eyes only for the hoop . <P> For the past 30 years , Princeton players have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shot second . When the leather of the roundball touches your hands , your first thought is , Who else is open ? Not , How am I gon na get my shot ? It 's not easy to learn , and it goes against the grain of me-first American individualism and the lure of million-dollar sneaker contracts . The highest skill of a Princeton basketball player is not to run , jump or shoot but to see . And it is still the rarest basketball skill of all . <P> Princeton is an anomaly not just because it starts five anonymous white guys in what has become a game of bigger-than-life black stars , but because in basketball today , individualism pays . Fans buy tickets to see darting one-on-one moves , awesome dunks and 30-point games by players with multimillion-dollar endorsement deals , not pinpoint bounce passes and pretty pick-and-rolls by a bunch of unknowns whose leading scorer is averaging under 15 points a game . <P> The real genius of the Princeton offense is not its moral idealism but its real-world practicality . At every moment you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move of your opponent  --  and gives you a way to overcome it . Is your man overplaying you ? Cut backdoor . Is he sloughing off ? Come out for the pass . If your teammate dribbles toward you , either cut away or scoot round for a hand-off . As if you were playing judo with a ball , you always use the strength of your opponent against him .
