BLINKED SIX TIMES AND checked the big liquid-crystal chrono that faced the hopchairs in the recovery room . I had been gone for three days , which pissed me off right from the start . Headhopper had only contracted for two . <p> When I looked down at the body I got mad all over again . Bruises around the wrists , ankles ; infected bite marks on the shoulders and breasts . Sick soreness between the legs . Pisswa ! I lunged to my feet and then fell back again into the squish-gel cushions of my hopchair . The dark fuzzy cushions molded to cradle the body . I gripped the chair armsupports until cushion stuff oozed up between the fingers . Dumb hopper had n't fed the body properly . <p> Those are the worst renters of all , the ones who have no manners and no sense of future . I spend half my waking time working to buff up the bod so someone else can enjoy it , and this is what I come home to ? I had Things to Say to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down a gallon of totalnute , and disinfect and treat the wounds . Who knew what other nasty surprises the hophead had left ? <p> The room still smelled of hopjuice and ozone and transfer jitters , and of the body , unpleasantly . Not even a shower before the hop ? Damned hopper ! <p> I looked around . Soft illumination came from a light ring near the conical apex of the room . Consoles and check-screens in the curved dark walls flickered and blinked and uttered small beeps , alive but unattended . Both the flush-mounted doors , one to the corridor and one to a closet , were closed . Footprints hashed the short dark fuzzcarpet on the floor . <p> The brain imprinter stood like a hunched black metal person behind the hopchairs , its tentacles dangling and its screens blank . The other hopchair was empty . It looked like a dark shiny egg cut in half with an scurve , the surface of the cut all squish-gel cushioning . Most of the monitoring and invasive equipment was hidden under the cushions . <p> How come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not that I wanted to see him or her . But we should be processing simultaneously . <p> " Hey ! Permo-tweak ! Where 's my rations ? " I yelled . Getting mad is a bad idea when you 're a sharebody . I knew that . There were a few minutes either side of a hop when nobody was home in the body , and when nobody was home , burglars and vandals could get in and mess things up . Treat your service people like the tweaks they were , and they could get nasty . And you could never pin it on them . There were always two or more administering hopjuice and catering to the imprinter and the monitors ; nothing ever stuck to them . <p> But when you 're an omnimatch and you keep in shape and ask for top megadollar , you do n't expect low-class hopheads . I was a top of the line Type 0 , at least before this hopper messed me up . I could tell illegal mones or stroids had been involved , the way my anger kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tweaks . <p> I monitored my breathing and did some mind exercises to control spoilspurts and spillers , hophead legacies one often came home to . The anger died down a little . I stretched while sitting , testing all the muscles . Weak and abused . Breathe . Deal with it . Move on . My attorney was going to squeeze this last hopper , oh yes . <p> " Hello ? " I said , toning the voice down . " Hello ? Sorry about that last yell . Leftover mones . I 'm not myself yet . " <p> No one came . Violation of procedure . When one is in recovery there are supposed to be service people present until a complete recovery is achieved , proved by matching a brain-wave profile with the original pattern , either the sharebody 's or the hopper 's . <p> I 'd never come home to such a bad place , not even when I first started out sharing the body and had no idea of what kind of contracts to sign . The recovery room looked like the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a room was nothing . The body was everything . It took caregivers to get you back to yourself . Damned tweaks . <p> I looked at the equipment embedded in the dark walls . There was a dispenser over there that would give me totalnute and whatever else I needed , if I could get that far , and if I could figure out the programming . I 'd never tried to run a Class Acts dispenser before . I was n't sure using a home dispenser qualified me . <p> I tried standing again , then sat down . Not yet . I felt the input on the back of the neck to reassure myself that whoever had hopped me had pulled the plug , unhooked me from the imprinter . Someone had been here to return me to the body . Where had they gone ? <p> The door opened . Someone edged in , his back to me . " Where 've you been ? " I demanded , then took a couple breaths to moderate my anger . " I need totalnute . Please . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw he was wearing a headcam , the zoom lens sticking out in front of his right eye . It focused on me . <p> " Who are you ? What are you doing here ? " " Press , " he said . " You the sharebody hosted Livida ? " " What ? " Livida , the biggest sensie-star on the continent ? Why would she need a sharebody ? She looked better on a bad day than I had ever looked . <p> He came closer . His lens scoped me up and down , focusing on the bruises , the bite marks . Finally he zoomed in on the face . " Cut it out ! " I said , lifting the hands to shield the face , peeking at him between the fingers . Anonymity was in my contract . I appreciated it when I was home , and my hoppers liked it when they were visiting . <p> " What 's the story ? " he said , reaching for the hands . " The story is I can kick you in the nuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polite . " <p> He took two steps back . He flipped the lens up and looked at me with his own eyes . " Come on , " he said . " You must have a story to tell . Do you remember any of what happened ? " <p> " Bud , I just got back . All I know is I 'm injured , my service people are n't here , and I need rations and healing . You tell me what 's the story . " <p> He elevated his eyebrows . " Do n't want to pollute a possible source , " he said . " C'm on . How 'd you get those marks ? " <p> " How should I know ? I was n't here . " " How could you be anywhere else ? " " That 's what a sharebody does . Gets out of the body while someone else uses it . You sure are ignorant . What newsource do you work for , anyway ? " <p> " The Tell-All , - he said , and I flinched . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts and harmful speculations . They 'd done a piece on sharebodies not too long ago that made us sound like instruments of the Devil , implied that anyone who wanted to keep their souls safe should stay away from us . The story did cause an upsurge in customers , but it scared my sister too . I hated anything that tweaked April 's stability . It was all she could do in that broken-up body of hers to maintain her sanity while she waited for her clone to ripen . <p> " So tell me again , for the record , your side of this whole thing , " he said . <p> " Forget it ! And give me that tape you got when you first came in or I 'll see you in court ! " <p> " Tape ? Shows what you know . My link feeds directly back to the station . " <p> " Tell them they better not use any of that or they 'll be in lawsuit hell . " <p> He shrugged and flipped his lens back over his eye . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for lawsuit hell . What 's your name ? " " None of your damned business ! Get out of here ! Help , someone ! " I looked around for a call button . Seemed to me there should be one around here , even though I 'd never had to use one ; service people had always been present when I needed them . I spotted a red button on the outside of the hopchair 's arm-support and pressed it hard three times . <p> Finally a big dark man in Class Act blues came in . " Help , please ! " I yelped , pointing at the reporter , and the service guy grabbed him and kicked him out . <p> " Thank you . Thank you , " I said . <p> " You the one all the shouting 's about ? " asked the orderly . " I do n't know . I have n't heard any shouting , except from that Tell-All guy . What 's going on ? " <p> He looked me over , frowned , and went to the wall dispenser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " Worst wakeup so far . Dumb bophead left me all messed up , moning , and nobody around to give me nute , " I agreed . <p> He brought me a big frosty glass of tickleberry totalnute with a straw in it . I did n't like that flavor . I sucked it up anyway and felt better right away . " Thanks , " I said , when I 'd finished . I could feel all those nutrients seeping into the system , strengthening me . " Thanks . " I flexed the wrists and ankles . Already the hurt was less . " Better start you on antibiotics , " he said , and gave me a shot . " My savior , " I said to this guy . Then : " Is it true , about Livida ? " " Seems likely . " <p> " Livida was in my body ? Why ? What happened ? " " Nearest I can tell , she just wanted to walk around and not be recognized . She 's hopped before , I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He found her while she was in your body , kidnapped her , tortured her . Another nute ? " <p> " Yes , please . Vanilla ? " " Sure . " He fetched me another . " Weird kind of crime . Now she 's back in her own body , feeling no pain , and giving a press conference . And here you are without even a follow-up . Sucks . " <p> " So right . " I closed the eyes and drank totalnute , feeling at last a certain peace as systems stabilized . " Hope she does n't skreek me for the extra day . " I could use the money . I was already buying April the best clone you could get , but it did n't hurt to have some bucks put away in case they came up with more and better mods , which they often did . Sometimes I let April headhop into me , but it was expensive-I could skip my own fee , but I had to pay prep , transfer , and follow-up fees , and every time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made . April understood . Every once in a while , she needed a hop , though . <p> " An interesting problem , " said the service guy . " Livida did n't stay away on purpose , unless this was a publicity stunt . Who 's liable ? " <p> " Insurance , maybe . Do n't know whose , though . They caught the stalker ? " <p> " Nope . He kept her and played with her for a day , then wrapped her up in orange parachute silk , taped her mouth and eyes - sorry , your mouth and eyes , there 's still some adhesive ; let me clean that up - and dropped her off in the Dumpmaster out back , where one of the cooks found you about half an hour ago . " He dampened a rag with some sort of cleanser and wiped it gently over the eyes and mouth . With all the other disturbances in the body , I had n't even noticed how sticky the face felt . I licked my lip . " They collect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " He washed you off pretty good , but not completely . Genemap should be ready sometime soon . They 'll catch him . How you feeling ? " <p> " Much better . Thanks again . " " Good . You 're welcome . " " I was hyped on mones , or maybe stroids , when I woke up . Could you check my balance , please " " Sure , " he said , and pressed a scanner against my arm . " Mones , huh ? True what they say about you sharies , you can taste your own blood without biting yourself ? " <p> " Not exactly , " I said . " I just have a real good sense of what I should feel like , and this is n't it . " I did some stretching exercises . Strength was flowing back into the muscles . I did some stretching exercises in my mind too . I 'd never had a conversation like this with a service person . " This stalker guy , he hurt the body , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wake up in . " <p> He studied the read-out on the scanner . " Hmm . Not mones . Some new kind of crystal . Better get you an evener . " He went back to the wall dispenser and keyed in a request , came back with a hypo , sent its contents into the bloodstream . <p> " Thanks , " I said for about the thirtieth time . I could feel the anger dying down . Yes ! Body was more and more mine again . " What 's your name ? " I could n't remember the number of hops I 'd made . I could n't remember a service person who 'd been so nice to me before . <p> " Patrick . What 's yours ? " " Marlena when I 'm home . Sharebody 209 when I 'm not . " " Nice to meet you , " he said . <p> We shook hands . I felt extremely peculiar . I had two friends ; both of them had started sharebodying about the same time I did . I had my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who might or might not use my services , might or might not do something for me - training , medical care , hopjuicing , whatever , mostly depending on whether I had credit or not . <p> Two friends , a sister , now Patrick . I flexed things , testing , and found that my coordination and strength were at about two thirds normal . " I feel-much better , " I said . I got to my feet . <p> " Must be weird , stuff happens to you , you do n't even remember it , " he said . <p> I shrugged . What I really wanted was a shower , but that would have to wait . I got my yellow coverall from the closet . I was glad it had long sleeves and ankle-length legs . I pulled it on , took a tie-back from the pocket , and tied my hair into a tail . " It 's just .. . what happens , " I told him . " Sometimes I 'm walking down the street and someone recognizes me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent together , or something . " I glanced down at the chip implanted on the inside of my right wrist . SB2090 it said , in tiny letters . " Then I show them this . Instant deep freeze . " I smiled at him . I did n't know why . I made more money in two days than he could make in two months , and I did n't even have to be awake while I did it . Sure , I put in the work : I kept the body up . Exercise , nutrition , medcare , dental work , skin care , spa care , hair styling . Left me a lot of time to do whatever else I wanted , though . <p> Mostly sitting with April , plugging in to media , seeing what I had missed while someone else was walking around in the body . <p> Watching Livida in the sensies , as she romanced , danced , and found pleasures , as she went on adventures and stirred up intrigues . She was always so cool . She was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss in a social situation . <p> When I met people on the street who had known not-me , I wondered how the headhoppers had gotten them to talk to the body . Some of these strangers were beautiful , even . When I was home in the body I would never have approached people who looked like that . I mean , I knew I 'd done a lot for my physique , but my face , well , it was just plain . I never had paid for any facesculpting ; sometimes people like plain - if it 's a visit , not a lifetime . <p> Once a man came up to me and kissed me . " Gabrielle ! " he said , touching my face and smiling down at me . <p> I wanted to smile back and pretend . But I knew if I did , things would be worse as soon as he figured it out . So I gave him my half-smile , and showed him my wrist . His eyes went wide . He stepped back from me , red staining his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little broken dreams , half started , never finding their close because I was not the sum body they had met . <p> Hopheads shrugged into my body like it was a suit of clothes . They looked like me . They did n't act like me . What was it they did that I did n't ? <p> Livida never had problems like this . Or maybe she did . <p> Was her stalker stalking her , or the people she played in the sensies ? Did he even know there was a difference ? <p> Did he realize he had split the hurt he caused in half ? Livida would remember it ; I would feel it . <p> " Does n't that seem strange to you ? " Patrick asked me . I could n't remember what we had been talking about . He picked up on it right away . " People thinking they know you when you do n't know them back . Does n't that feel weird ? " <p> " This is a big city . It does n't happen that often . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seeing a 3D postcard hanging on the back wall with other bright-colored snippets of travels : me and this fat balding guy , standing next to a strung-up marlin on some fishing boat in the Caribbean . We were both laughing . Well , whoever had hopped into me was laughing along with the Big Sportsman , anyway . His wife ? His male lover trying a new wrinkle ? <p> I did n't look at the back of the postcard . " Having a wonderful time . Wish you were here , " probably . I found another neighborhood bar instead . <p> " My face okay ? " I asked . <p> " Clean and no bruises , anyway , " said Patrick . " Thanks , " I said to him for the hundredth time . I 'd never thanked anybody so much in my entire life . I wanted to tip him really well , but that seemed rude . Maybe I could tip him at a credit terminal downstairs . I checked his ID badge . HURON , it said . <p> " I better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone explained things to my sister . But I bet they did n't . " Maybe I should call her . I looked around for a link . Not a feature of recovery rooms , apparently . <p> " She watch the news ? " asked Patrick . " Damn ! " That stupid reporter and his headcam ! " You did n't sign a release , did you ? " <p> " Nope . Guy did n't care . Works for Tell-All . Said they live for lawsuits . " <p> " Damn , " said Patrick . " I 'll walk you out . " " Thanks , " I said again . <p> He went through the door first . Then he turned and pushed me back into the room . Lights shone around his edges : cams aimed our direction . Voices called questions . He keyed a code into the doorpad , and the door slid shut and locked . " Press out there like flies on syrup , " he said . He lifted his wrist : he had a comlink on it . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Chief ? " " What are all these press people doing in the secure area on floor 23 ? " " Agel gave them the go-ahead . " <p> " Has she lost her mind ? This is not exactly positive publicity . Get them out of here . " " Will do . " <p> He flipped the cover down on the comlink and glanced at me . I went and sat down in the hopchair again . " You 're not a caregiver . " " Not generally . " <p> " Huh . Can I call my sister on your wristcom ? " He shook his head . " Internal frequency only . Sorry . We 'll be out of here in a few minutes . " <p> We sat quiet for a little while . Presently he said , " Do you know who was supposed to be on your recovery team ? " I shook my head . " By the time I settled in there was no one here . " " It 'll be on record somewhere , " he muttered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired . Just so you know . Tweaks . " <p> " Fired ? " " Not doing their jobs . Omnimatches are rare ! What got into them , leaving you like that ? " " Livida ? " I guessed . " No excuse , " he said . I thought about that . My contract with Class Acts specified certain minimal care , and they had n't given it to me , it was true . I could jump to some other Headhop Emporium . I could even sue if I wanted to , but it would probably poison the well for me as to future employment . On the other hand , omnimatches were rare . Most sharebodies could only be used by one or two of the twelve mind-types . A template like mine did n't happen very often . <p> April and I were trying to train her clone to be another such , though . April headhopped into the developing body daily as it lay dormant in a wash of nute and thought for its brain so that it would be ready to receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and did mind-stretching exercises . <p> The clonemakers were monitoring everything we did . If we were successful ... well , my attorney had patents pending . The door beeped . Patrick spoke on his wristcom , then went over and keyed in a number . The door opened . <p> Livida came in , and the door shut behind her . She looked exhausted . Not how you were supposed to look after returning from a hop . While you were gone your body was resting and being refreshed with the best nute and electrical stimulation available . If you had medical problems they could be corrected while you were out enjoying yourself . Cosmetic surgery . Eye surgery . Mods implanted . Fact , you could wear out your sharebody , if you got that kind of contract and paid enough , and come home to a really comfortable place . <p> She looked tired , and her eyes were puffy , her nose red . Real crying . She came and stood in front of me , held out hands I had seen in twenty sensies . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had a million layers of extra meaning in it . I could n't think of a single way to answer . She reached for the hands , and I lifted them . She took them and stared at their backs , stroked a thumb across the knuckle . " These were mine for a little while , " she said . <p> I stared at her thumbnail . There was a nick in the edge of it . I 'd seen her hands more times than I could count , felt as close to inside them as I could get without headhopping , and I 'd never seen a nick in one of her nails before . <p> " Ms. Redmond , how much did you tell the press ? " Patrick asked before I could figure out why it felt so strange to hold hands with someone I 'd never met but thought I knew very well . <p> " I do n't know , " Livida said , her voice troubled . " I 've never ended a hop the way this one ended . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was telling them , only they seemed so much more loud than usual . Usually I feel much calmer , much more ready to face things . Usually my publicist makes sure no one knows I 've hopped at all , and there 's no press . I ca n't remember - I ca n't - I - " <p> I stood up and steered her into the other hopchair . " It 's the crystal , " I said . <p> " But the crystal was in your body , " Patrick said . " How would that translate ? " <p> " Disrupted her thinking patterns . Must not have gotten a good brainwave profile match when they hopped her home . How did they know it was her ? " <p> " I 'll have to see the records . There are six toplines that match no matter what your mental state , though . The other fourteen are usually a little waggy . " He got out a scanner and pressed it to Livida 's arm . His eyebrows rose . " Mimics crystal , all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , got a hypo , injected it into Livida 's arm . " This should make you feel better , Ms. Redmond . " <p> She sniffed , wiped the tears from her cheeks with her fingertips . " It 's been so awful , " she said . " All I want to do is go to sleep .... Oh , that is better . Thank you . " She blinked and looked up at me . Her eyes were violet and intense . " Body , " she said . " I 'm so sorry this happened . Before he caught me it was the best hop I ever made . You are so comfortable , and so able . I was thinking I 'd like to use you at least once a month . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry he hurt you . I do n't know what to do - " <p> " I 'll be fine , " I said . " I 'll get better . I do n't think there 's any permanent damage . It 's not your fault . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me - " <p> " Just because you do something well in public , that 's no reason for you to be punished , " I said . <p> She licked her upper lip . I 'd seen that a hundred times too . It could mean any of six things : an invitation to sex ; deep thought ; uncertainty ; I 'm hungry ; I do n't know what to say next ; my lip is dry . I was so used to watching her , sensing her , being her , that I forgot we were in the middle of a conversation . One did n't talk during a sensie ; one just sat back and felt , and waited for whatever would happen next . <p> Her eyes clouded . " I ca n't even - " she said . She touched my hand . She reached out and rolled my coverall sleeve up , stared at the bruises around my wrist . " That was real , " she whispered . She touched it and I winced . She glanced back at her own wrist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But now it 's not . " She let go of my arm and covered her eyes with her hands . <p> Patrick talked to his wristcom some more . Finally he opened the door and there was no one outside but some security people , and someone Livida called Zachary . She ran to him , and he embraced her ; it looked like what happened at the end of most of her sensies . <p> " They 've caught him , " someone said . " The stalker . They 've caught him , Livida . " <p> She was n't listening , though . She was gripping Zachary 's arm . She was walking away . She never looked back . I never wanted to go for facesculpting , but after that newsbyte from Tell-All played on the hour and on the half for a week , people noticed the body on the street . " Livida ! Livida ! " they yelled , and I did n't know how to answer . They asked for autographs . <p> So I took some of my savings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I augmented the cheekbones just enough to look like someone else . I kept the plain , though . <p> April still watches Livida 's sensies , but I take myself out of the net when they come on . <p> I know her . I know her better than I know myself . She was inside the body . So many times I was inside her image , living her manufactured life because it was better than my real one . I was n't in the body while she was , but I lived with the aftereffects of what had happened to her , and that made me feel even more as though I know her . <p> I watched a replay of her press conference after the hop , and I knew her mind . We 'd shared the pain and the crystal and the confusion . Somehow I no longer know who I am . I do n't think she knows who she is either . <p> Oh , I do n't want to be her . It 's okay if one person at a time wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being me . But I do n't ever want the whole world wanting me . Not like that . <p>
