<p> Alexander Calder , America 's greatest 20th-century sculptural innovator , is probably best known in Washington for the giant mobile that slowly sweeps around the National Gallery 's East Building atrium , animating that vast interior space with its warmth and playfulness . How well it succeeds is reflected in the smiling faces of visitors and their wide-eyed children . That still untitled 920-pound aluminum giant  --  with its 76-foot wingspan  --  is one of Calder 's last and greatest public sculptures . And it represents the best-known and most monumental aspect of the artist 's remarkable career , which will come under fresh scrutiny starting Sunday in the National Gallery 's definitive retrospective , " Alexander Calder : 1898-1976 . " <p> But there is another side to Calder 's work  --  a more intimate side  --  that offers greater insight into the man himself and his unstoppable inventiveness . Nowhere was that more evident than in the spaces where Calder lived . <p> As anyone will attest who had the good fortune to visit Calder  --  at his homestead in Roxbury , Conn. , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loire Valley  --  art pervaded every aspect of his life , there was no boundary in between . <p> Thanks to a timely new picture book and memoir by photographer Pedro E. Guerrero , a longtime Calder friend , we can now peek into the artist 's vanished domestic universe , where the tale is most vividly told . Titled " Calder at Home : The Joyous Environment of Alexander Calder " documents the houses and studios , most importantly in France , where Calder spent most of his last 13 years . The author recounts his many visits with the artist and his wife , Louisa . Guerrero recalls drowsy lunches of local bread , cheese , sausage and red wine  --  apparently lots of red wine . There are telling details , including the curious fact that while Calder owned expensive glazed porcelain dishes he 'd designed for Sevres , they were never used . <p> Guerrero 's photographs conjure , as no verbal description could , the exuberant creative clutter that surrounded the Calders . At the Roxbury farmhouse , which had a painted black exterior , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packing crate , rough tables and an antique stove . Ladles hung from nails . Small mobiles , animal sculptures and bottles covered the mantel . A flattened can of olive oil nailed to a wooden frame served as a tray . <p> Calder , who could n't tolerate anything that was n't well designed , fashioned brass wire handles for Chinese teacups . Coke bottle " binoculars " were kept on the sill of a window looking toward neighbors Arthur Miller and Marilyn Monroe . " He made them , he said playfully , ' so I can see Marilyn better , ' " Guerrero recounts . <p> Calder 's wife infused colors into the plain interiors with her hooked rugs . " The floors were Louisa 's , the ceiling belonged to Sandy , and their friends Leger , Miro and Tamayo among them festooned the walls , " Guerrero writes . <p> Most memorable in this book are images of the picturesque but dilapidated 17th-century French farmhouse in Sache , near Tours , which the Calders fell in love with and modestly renovated in 1953 . They acquired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a former correspondent in Washington named Jean Davidson ( son of sculptor Jo Davidson ) , who later married the one of the Calders ' two daughters , Sandra . Davidson added running water and electricity . <p> The Calders raised the hearth at one end of the long room that filled the first floor and carved out a primitive cooking area at the other , festooned with hanging pots , pans and baskets . They hung mobiles from the rafters and Calder 's paintings on the whitewashed walls . The furniture , locally made or previously owned , was hidden beneath an eye-boggling patchwork of textile throws picked up on the Calders ' accelerating travels . Gradually , the floors became covered with the small rugs Louisa made , based on her husband 's designs and favorite colors : red , black , blue and yellow . <p> When lighting was needed , Calder fashioned lampshades from gelatin molds and snipped wall sconces from squares of corrugated aluminum , with cut-off beer can bottoms to hold the candles . He hammered primitive-looking spoons and forks out of silver wire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always enthusiastic about toys and string , " he once wrote , " and always a junk man of bits of wire and all the prettiest stuff in the garbage can . " <p> This warm-hearted book came about by happy accident . In 1963 , Guerrero was sent to photograph a story for House &; Garden magazine on " a man 's influence in the kitchen . " And lo and behold , the man turned out to be Alexander Calder , by then one of the world 's most famous artists . It also turned out that his influence in the kitchen went well beyond making dinner : Just about everything in sight  --  colanders and cups , even fly swatters , wastebaskets , light fixtures and some furniture  --  was his creation . Louisa , in fact , did most of the cooking . <p> It looked like a great story to Guerrero , but not to the magazine 's editors . According to his version , recounted in the book , they quickly scrapped it because " no products by the magazine 's advertisers were visible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began a friendship with the Calders that lasted until Calder 's death . In the years that followed , the photographer returned many times to visit and to document their extraordinary life style . <p> The fact that Calder 's father and grandfather were both accomplished sculptors , and his mother a portraitist , surely had something to do with Calder 's prodigious artistic imagination . According to his grandson Alexander S.C . Rower , who wrote a foreword to Guerrero 's book ( and also has just published a delightful little book of his own , titled " Calder Sculpture " ) , Calder was 10 when he began making jewelry for his sister 's dolls , games for the family and works of art , which he presented to his parents as gifts . <p> Even at age 8 , when he received his first tools from his artist-parents , Calder was tinkering and re-inventing things  --  just as he later re-invented sculpture with his mobiles . Three years later , he made a startlingly modern , abstract duck by drawing upon , then folding and snipping a sheet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Gallery show . ) Throughout his life , he would fashion animal action toys from coffee cans , portraits from wire , jewelry from spools and spirals of hammered silver . His present to his wife on her 43rd birthday  --  also in the show  --  was a felt-lined cigar box with compartments for five miniature mobiles . <p> Calder once explained that " how things worked " was the only subject that interested him , apart from art . He earned a degree in mechanical engineering at 19 but soon was in New York studying painting and doing illustrations for the National Police Gazette . By the 1920s , he found his way into the heady , avant-garde art world of Paris . He became known there for the mechanized miniature circus he 'd created out of wire , wood and cloth , and often " performed " ( or , more precisely , cranked ) for paying audiences and friends . He also was seeking to add movement to his increasingly abstract sculptures , and soon did . By 1930 , he 'd invented the new sculptural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of World War II , though he was spending more and more time in France  --  or perhaps because of it  --  Calder was fast becoming the most internationally acclaimed American sculptor of his generation . If he continued to live in jumbled modesty , it was clearly by choice . But in 1972 , Guerrero recalls , he received a postcard from Calder that said , " We have a new shack , very fancy . " The Calders had finally built a big , airy house and studio from native stone and concrete not far from the old house in Sache , which they called Sache II . But while light-struck and more commodious , with a greenhouse for Louisa and more room for art  --  including African sculptures hung high on the walls  --  it was filled with the same spirit and most of the same furnishings as the earlier house . " It soon took on the look of having been a Calder house since the beginning of time , " writes Guerrero . Happily , he managed to return and complete his record of the Calders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist died in 1976 . <p> The resulting book , while not profound , is a tender , highly personal recollection of a truly remarkable and original artist . It also adds depth to what has become , since Calder 's death , a far-too-shallow perception of him . Fair warning : The book may leave you as eager to go to France as to the National Gallery show , which will continue through July 12 . <p> Other public works by Calder in Washington include " Mountains and Clouds " in the Hart Senate Building and " Gwenfritz " at the National Museum of American History .
