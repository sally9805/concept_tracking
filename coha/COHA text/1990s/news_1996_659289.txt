Logging onto his personal computer , a young executive instructs his bank to pay bills , checks on his investments and completes an online car loan application . <p> His wife calls . Away on a business trip , she has just transferred cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savings to their checking account . <p> His son charges in , late for school and bellowing about lunch money . Dad grabs the boy 's smart card - a plastic credit card look-alike embedded with a computer chip - and swipes it through a card reader in his PC to download electronic cash from his bank account onto the card . <p> Banks hope this scenario becomes reality in the not-too-distant future . They 're betting that online innovations will transform the way consumers complete most financial transactions , from buying a cup of coffee to investing for retirement . <p> About 200 , or 1 percent , of financial institutions in North America currently offer online banking , but because most large banks offer it , it is available to 60 percent of consumer banking customers , said Jim Bruene , editor of the OnLine Banking Report , an industry newsletter based in Seattle . <p> If the industry has its way , every household will be banking soon from a home computer . " We see the numbers of online banking customers exploding from prior years , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chase Manhattan Corp . <p> But it 's not certain that consumers will take to the new technology in enough numbers to justify the expense to banks . Dana Massie , an online client of Wells Fargo Bank , is director of technical research for Creative Technology Ltd. , a multi-media company , and is probably as computer-savvy as banking customers come . <p> But , Massie said , " I do n't have a lot of patience for complicated stuff at home . When computers are as reliable and easy to use as televisions , then they will take off , because they 're a lot more fun . But computers have to stop crashing , they have to turn on instantly - and computers are loud . " <p> Financial companies believe online banking will lower transaction costs and give them an edge over competitors . They 've taken studies showing that customers like online banking because it saves them time , and that it appeals to merchants because it saves on billing and processing costs . <p> But the notion of winging theoretical money through cyberspace still sends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about security and privacy . Many people still want to handle cash and speak face-to-face with their bankers . <p> A closer look at online banking : <p> HOW DID WE GET HERE ? <p> Online banking actually has been around for years . " It may be one of those overnight success stories that took 15 years to develop , " quips Bob Schettino , a spokesman for Intuit Corp. , which makes the Quicken home finance software . <p> The huge growth in consumer purchases of PCs over the past decade has fed the expansion of online banking . By 1995 , more than 30 million households in the United States had home computers . More than a third used some type of personal finance software . <p> Intuit and other software makers figured out how users of their home finance software could communicate via PC and modem with their banks . And the Internet became vastly more popular and more secure , leading to the creation in October 1995 of Security First Network Bank , the first Internet-only bank . <p> Meanwhile , significant innovations in the smart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial transactions from a computer or telephone . The smart card - even more than the magnetic stripe card , which made automatic teller machines and debit cards possible - turned on its ear the notion that banking customers must visit a bank . <p> Financial institutions began using online banking to attract and keep customers . PC owners , who as a group are young , well educated and affluent , are prize customers indeed . <p> A few large banks , including Chase Manhattan Corp. , Citibank , Bank of America and Wells Fargo , developed or acquired online banking systems . Other financial firms formed alliances with technology companies - Visa International has teamed with Microsoft Corp. , while 15 banks formed a consortium with IBM . <p> But online banking is still nascent . Of the 10 million households that use Intuit software products , only about 350,000 or 3.5 percent , have signed up for online banking , Intuit said . The American Bankers Association said about 1 percent of transactions in 1995 were completed online . <p> ONLINE BANKING AND YOU <p> What does this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount of time consumers spends on finances , and allows them to work on them any time of the day or night . No more racing to the bank Friday afternoon to deposit a paycheck - Chase said 40 percent of its online banking is done on the weekend . <p> Some consumers have been leery of doing banking or other personal business on the Internet , which works like a huge electronic party line , for fear someone could steal private information . But developers of online banking technology say new scrambling and encryption techniques have made Internet transactions safer . <p> Indeed , researchers are concentrating on new applications that allow banking and commerce directly on the Internet , as well as through online service providers like America Online and CompuServe . They say online commerce is safer than giving a credit card number out over the telephone . <p> A big stumbling block to the growth of online banking is that most vendors such as department stores and utilities do n't accept electronic payments . Right now , this is a chicken-and-egg problem for banks - vendors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't use . Consumers are leery of investing in technology that vendors do n't accept . <p> John Dickinson , a self-professed computer geek and freelance magazine editor , has been doing online banking for 12 years and pays 95 percent of his personal and business bills that way . But he still gets into scrapes with vendors . <p> He said he ca n't get his phone company , for example , to consolidate the eight paper bills that it sends each month for different accounts at his San Francisco home and office . <p> And Pacific Gas &; Electric Corp . was taking two weeks to process his payments , and then started dunning him for being late . Three months ago , he " got really bored with calling them up all the time , so I just threw up my hands " and got the utility company to automatically debit his checking account each month . <p> WHY THE BANKS WANT IT <p> Financial institutions are in a life-or-death race with technology and telecommunications companies to provide home banking services . <p> Electric utilities , telephone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial information and are trying to develop new services . If customers can transfer money and get loans via a technology or communications company that already has lines into their homes , why would they need a bank ? <p> So banks must reassert control of the banking business , or cede it to non-financial companies . But regaining control is tricky indeed . Banks have invested billions of dollars in technology - such as machines to read magnetic stripes on cards - which is fast becoming obsolete . They have also built , at tremendous expense , a lavish branch system that , while shrinking , is expensive to maintain . <p> Banks have to make good on these investments before they charge into new technologies that may themselves be quickly obsolete . They also must stay innovative enough to keep their increasingly computer-adventurous customers . The task is somewhat like catching a moving bus . <p> " By the time people get literate with PCs , " said Frank Woosley , director of financial services consulting for Deloitte &; Touche in Dallas , " the smart banks are going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a PC and eliminate it altogether , " like drafting checks , reconciling statements and moving money between accounts . <p> If they are to continue to be the place where people deposit and borrow money , banks must devise cost-effective ways to turn the new technology into programs customers and merchants will use . <p> That is a tall order , even for banking powerhouses . " But if we 're not doing that , " Woosley said , " we 're not going to be in business much longer . " <p> Headline : Your Financial Records : WHO Gets to See Them ? <p> TEXT : <p> Online banking and smart cards allow the creation of a lode of personal information about the people who use them , documenting not only their financial transactions , but where they go and what they do . <p> Developers of these technologies are wrestling with ground rules about who should be able to see the information . Insurance companies ? Law enforcement personnel ? Doctors , lawyers , juries ? Should the information ever be sold ? <p> " Businesses owe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're doing with the information , whether it 's selling it to third parties , and allow them to make a choice about whether their personal information is released , " said John Burke , of the Washington , D.C. law firm of Foley , Hoag &; Eliot , and counsel to the Smart Card Forum . <p> Credit reporting companies are prohibited from disclosing personal financial information . But there is no federal law preventing banks from selling or giving away their customers ' financial information , although case law favors the customer , said John Wright , counsel to Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco . <p> Some states , like California , prohibit it . There are no restrictions on nonbanks , Wright said . <p> But banks and merchants want customers to use online banking and smart cards precisely for the information they can provide , and will invest in the technology only if they can use the information to sell more products . <p> For example , a bank could flash to a person 's home computer a message that her car lease is about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Retail merchants could use smart card information to find new customers . <p> The marketing angle is only the beginning . In parts of Europe , smart cards are programmed to carry medical , pharmacy and insurance records . They can contain driving records and voter registrations . Welfare recipients in the United States may soon carry smart cards with records of every welfare payment and food stamp transaction . <p> Most financial and technology companies hope the privacy issue will be addressed in the market rather than by regulators . A customer should be able to instruct a vendor not to release information , or to say he does not wish to receive marketing information .
