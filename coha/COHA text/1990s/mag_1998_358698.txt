It takes an agile mind to defend drunk driving and kids ' smoking . Take the modest proposal to set the drunk-driving threshold at .08 blood-alcohol content nationwide  --  stricter than the .10 standard in 34 states . The liquor lobby long played on the fear that .08 would mean social drinkers who 've had a few after work would all fail the Breathalizer . But research shows you can drink yourself silly before reaching .08 : a 170-lb. man can guzzle four martinis inside an hour on an empty stomach before he gets there . He may not be sloppy drunk , but who wants to run into this guy on the road ? A quarter of the 17,000 drunk-driving deaths in 1996 happened at .08 or less ; impairment starts as low as .02 . The drinking lobby admits that at .08 , even though you 're not sober , you 're sober enough to choose not to drive . An industry member at a state hearing argued that a couple of drinks " might improve driving ability . " The Republican-controlled House Rules Committee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million since 1987 ; Speaker Newt Gingrich got the most ) , killed the tougher standard last week . So let 's raise a glass  --  or four  --  to the audacious more-careful-drunk theory . <P> But it 's the tobacco crowd that leads the way in audacity . For years the industry denied liability for the almost 400,000 annual smoking-related deaths because everyone knew smoking could kill you  --  everyone , that is , but tobacco executives themselves ! In 1996 they raised their nicotine-stained right hands before Congress and pleaded ignorance , a perjury charge Ken Starr could get his teeth into , if only he were not already representing these guys . When subpoenaed documents revealed an industry hell-bent on hooking kids , even tobacco 's core congressional defenders blanched . Gingrich vowed he would be tougher than the President . The McCain bill , which raises the price of cigarettes to reduce teen smoking , sailed through the Senate Commerce Committee , 19 to 1 . <P> But then the new Newt returned from his contrition tour promoting his book , Lessons Learned the Hard Way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling it " a big government , big bureaucracy " bill , language almost identical to the industry 's . Had he suddenly bought into one of its most ludicrous arguments , that the price hike places an unfair burden on the poor , who smoke the most and , ironically , save the country money by dying early ? Industry advocates contend that a smoker with a pack-a-day habit pays so much in cigarette tax and collects so much less in Social Security benefits that society ends up ahead . But is n't premature death as fiscal policy a little hard to square with right-to-life and family values ? <P> Then there 's the phony statistic that just a handful of smokers are teenagers . Sure , but only because 19-year-olds eventually turn 20 . More than 90% of smokers begin as teenagers because even 20-year-olds are too mature to start up . Republicans are so addicted to tobacco money that they seem to be willing to risk kids ' health and their majority in Congress for it . Gingrich 's postelection book might be Lessons Learned the Really Hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
