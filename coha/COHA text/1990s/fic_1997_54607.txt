Alvin Boudreaux had outlived his neighbors . His asbestos-siding house was part of a tiny subdivision built in the 1950 's , when everybody had children , a single-lane driveway , a rotating TV antenna , and a picnic table out back . Nowadays he sat on his little porch and watched the next wave of families occupy the neighborhood , each taking over the old houses , driving up in their pairs of bug-shaped cars , one for each spouse to drive to work . Next door , Melvin Tillot had died , and his wife had sold the house to migrate up north with her daughter . Mr. Boudreaux used to watch her white puff of hair move through the yard as she snipped roses . Now she was gone , and there was no movement on his street that had consequence for him . Today he sat and watched the sky for sailing wedges of birds , or an army of ranked mackerel clouds , or the electric bruise of a thunderstorm rising from the molten heat of the Gulf . Sometimes he thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that time of life when the past began coming around again , as if to reclaim him . Lately he thought about his father , the sugarcane farmer , who used to teach him about tractors and steam engines . <p> Two months before , Mr. Boudreaux had watched his new neighbors move in , a young blond woman , overweight , with thin hair , and raw , nervous eyes . The husband was small and mean , sat in a lawn chair in the backyard as though he was at the beach , and drank without stopping , every weekend . They had one ten-yearold , a plain , slow-moving daughter . <p> Mr. Boudreaux could not bear to look at these people . They let the rose bushes die of thirst and left the empty garbage cans sitting at the edge of the street until the grass under them forgot what the sun looked like , and died . They never sat on their porch , and they had no pets that he could see . But after a while , he tried to talk to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . Her voice was thin , like a little squeak against the thumb . She worked somewhere for six hours each day , she told him , running an electric coffee-grinding machine . <p> One mild afternoon , Mr. Boudreaux was going to visit the graveyard , and he rattled open a kitchen window to air the room out while he was gone . Next door , he saw the daughter come into the yard and show her father a sheet of paper . The father curled up his lip and took a swallow from a tall tumbler , looking away . Mr. Boudreaux felt sorry for the girl when she placed a hand on the father 's shoulder and the man grabbed the sheet from her and balled it up . She put a forefinger to her glasses as if to bring the world into focus . The motion showed practice and patience . She was formless and looked overweight in her pleated skirt and baggy white blouse . Her carroty hair was gathered in a short tail above her neck , her lips were too big for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pale blue plastic , the kind of glasses little girls wore thirty years before . She stepped next to her father 's chair again , getting in his space , as Mr. Boudreaux 's grandson would say . The father began to yell , something about a damned science project . He waved his arms , and his face grew red . Another child might have cried . <p> The next afternoon , Mr. Boudreaux was on his knees , pulling grass by the backyard fence when he heard the school bus grind up LeBoeuf Street . He was still pulling when the father came home at four-thirty and sat in the lawn chair , next to the back steps . The girl appeared behind the screen door , like a shadow . <p> " It 's got to be turned in Monday , " she said . Even her voice was ordinary , a plain voice with little music in it . <p> The father put his glass against his forehead . " I do n't know anything about it , " he said . " Do you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifted at the screen , then dispersed like smoke , in a moment the mother came out and stepped carefully past her husband , not looking at him until she was safely on the grass . " I 'd help her " she said . " But i do n't know anything about that . Electricity . It 's something a man 'll have to do . " <p> The husband drained his drink and flung the ice cubes at the fence . Mr. Boudreaux felt a drop hit the back of his spotted hand . " Why ca n't she do something like a girl would do ? Something you could help her with . " <p> Mr. Boudreaux peered through the honeysuckle . The man was wearing jeans and a white button-down shirt with some sort of company emblem embroidered on the breast , a gay and meandering logo which suggested bowling alley or gas station . <p> The mother looked down and patted the grass in a semicircle with her left foot . " You 're her parent , too , " she said . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The father stood up , and the flimsy chair turned over on its side . He turned around and looked at it for a moment , then kicked it across the yard . <p> After dark , Mr. Boudreaux went out on his front porch with a glass of iced tea and listened , wondering whether the girl 's parents ever argued . He had never heard them , but then he remembered that since the coming of air conditioning , he 'd heard little from inside anyone 's house . When he first moved to the neighborhood , up and down LeBoeuf Street he could hear the tinny cheer of radios , the yelps of children chasing through the houses , a rare yelling match about money or relatives . But now there was only the aspirate hum of the heat pumps and the intermittent ahhh of an automobile 's tires on the subdivision 's ebony streets . He looked over at his fifteen-year-old Buick parked in the single drive . It embarrassed him to drive such a large old car through the neighborhood where everyone stood out and washed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to trade it off for something that would fit in . Next door , the father came out arid walked stiffly to his candy-apple car and drove away , dragging his tires at every shift of the gears , irk , irk . <p> The next morning , Mr. Boudreaux came out for the paper and saw Carmine sitting on her front steps waiting for the bus to appear out of the fog . Her eyes were red . He picked up the paper and began walking back toward the porch , telling himself , Do n't look . But at his front steps he felt a little electrical tug at his neck muscles , a blank moment of indecision . <p> He turned his head . " Good morning , little miss , " he called out , raising his paper . <p> " Morning , Mr. Boudreaux . " Her low voice was small in the fog . <p> " How you doing in school ? " He unfolded the paper and pretended to read the headline . <p> " Okay , " <p> He bounced once on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house and not look back . " It 's springtime , " he said . " My kids used to have to make their science projects this time of year " <p> She looked over at him , her eyebrows up in surprise . " You have kids ? " <p> Mr. Boudreaux realized how impossibly old he must seem . " Sure . A long time ago . They 're nurses and engineers and one 's a policeman way up in Virginia . They all had their science projects . What about you ? " <p> She looked down at a heavy brown shoe . " I want to do one , but no one can help me , " she said . <p> He banged the paper against his leg several times before he said anything more . He closed his eyes . " Is your momma home ? Let me talk to her a minute . " <p> That 's how it got started . After school , she rang his doorbell , and he led her into the kitchen where he fixed her a Coke float @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her drink in less than a minute , placing the glass in the sink and sitting down again at Mr. Boudreaux 's table , spreading open a spiral-bound tablet . She gave him a blank look of evaluation , an expression she might use on a strange dog . <p> Mr. Boudreaux sat down across from her . " Well , missy , what kind of project you interested in ? Your momma said you needed a little push in the right direction . " <p> " What did you do when you had a job ? " she asked , pushing her hair out of her eyes . <p> He blinked . " I started as a millwright at LeBlanc Sugar Mill , and when I retired , I was a foreman over all the maintenance people . " <p> She frowned . " Does that mean you do n't know anything about electricity ? " <p> Leaning back , he rubbed a spot over his eye . " I worked on a lot of motors in my time . " <p> Carmine scooted her chair closer and showed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn with legs , all running into a narrow cylinder and jumping one by one out of the other end of it . " These are electrons , " she said . Some of the electrons were running through a bigger cylinder , and more of them seemed to be coming out the other side . " The tube shapes are resistors , " she instructed . " Some let electrons through fast , some slow . " Her short linger led his attention along the rows of exiting electrons , which had little smiles drawn on them , as though they had earned passage to a wonderful place . She told him how resistors control current and how without them no one could have ever made a television or computer . <p> Mr. Boudreaux nodded . " So what you going to call this project ? " <p> " Resistance . " She said the word as though it had another meaning . <p> " And we got ta figure out how to demonstrate it , right ? " He closed his eyes and thought back to those late-night projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patrolman , had done friction . Friction , the old man thought . That was right up Sid 's alley . " We have to state a problem and show how it 's solved with resistors . Then we demonstrate how they work . " <p> Carmine bobbed her head . " You have done this before . " <p> The next afternoon , they sprawled on the rug in the den , drawing and brainstorming . When Mr. Boudreaux let the girl out at suppertime , he saw her father standing on the front walk , glowering . The next morning was Saturday , and he and Carmine got into his venerable Buick to go down to the electronics store at the mall . The girl hardly looked at her list . She spent her time browsing the tall pegboard sections hung with diodes and toggle switches , condensers and capacitors , fondling little transistors through the thin plastic bags . Mr. Boudreaux tended to business , buying a pack of foot-square circuit boards , little red push switches , eighteen-gauge wire . Carmine had brought him a dogeared book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memorized the banding codes for resistors . With this knowledge he selected an assortment of plastic cylinders which looked like tiny jelly beans decorated with red , black , and silver bands , an inch of silver wire coming out of each end . <p> Their purchases stowed in a loopy plastic bag , they walked the mall to the candy counter , where Mr. Boudreaux bought a quarter-pound of lime slices . Carmine took a green wedge from him , saying nothing , and they walked on through the strollers , teenagers , and senior citizens limping along in running shoes . Mr. Boudreaux looked at the children who were Carmine 's age . They seemed stylish and energetic as they played video games or preened in the reflections of shop windows . Carmine was mechanical , earnest , and as communicative as a very old pet dog . <p> When they got back to Mr. Boudreaux 's house , Carmine 's father was standing in their way , wavering in the slim line of grass that ridged the middle of the driveway . The old man got out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been drinking again . He pointed a chewed fingernail at Mr. Boudreaux . " You should have asked me before you took that girl off somewhere . " <p> " I asked your wife . You were n't awake yet . " <p> " Well , let me tell you , I was worried . I called up the police and checked you out . " Carmine came around the car and stood between them , staring down the street as though she could see all the way to Texas . <p> Mr. Boudreaux passed his tongue along his bottom lip . " The police . You called the police about me ? Why 'd you do that ? " <p> " You ca n't tell , nowadays . Old guys such as yourself and kids . You know ? " The father stuck his pale hands into a pair of tight work pants . <p> The old man looked at the ground . He was embarrassed hecause he did n't know what to think , other than that nobody used to imagine such things . Not in a million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your kid or something ? " he said at last . " Look . " He held out the plastic bag . " I helped her pay for her stuff " <p> Carmine 's father pointed a finger at Mr. Boudreaux . " She can pay for her own stuff . You keep your money in your pocket , " he said . " I do n't know why you think you got to do this . " He gave the girl a wounded glance and then turned toward his steps . <p> Mr. Boudreaux looked at Carmine . She pushed her glasses up her nose and looked back at him . " Did you have a little girl back when you were a father ? " she asked . <p> He looked at his house and then back at the child . " Yes , I did . Her name is Charlene . And I have another named Monica . " <p> For the first time that day , her expression changed and showed surprise . " What would anybody need with two girls ? " <p> That afternoon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide where to put headings , and how to divide the information up . After supper she came over , and they planned the display . Carmine drew out a design on lined paper with an oversized pencil . " I want those little button switches that work like doorbells here , " she said . " On the first circuit I want a straight wire to a flashlight bulb in one of those sockets we bought . On the second line I want a twenty-two-ohm resistor to the same size bulb . That 'll make the bulb glow dimmer . " She stuck out her tongue and bit it as she drew carbon ribbons of circuits . " The third button will turn on a line with two twenty-two-ohm resistors soldered together in series , and the bulb will glow dimmer . " She went on to draw in the fourth circuit , which would be an ordinary pencil wired to show how current can pass through carbon , " which is what resistors are made of , " she told him . A fifth circuit would have a rotary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbol for a variable resistor at this point and put down her pencil . <p> " Now what ? " Mr. Boudreaux asked , rubbing his eyes with his long forefingers . Since he 'd reached his late seventies , he 'd been going to bed around eight-thirty . At the moment , his knees were aching like great boils . <p> " Now we have to solder this together on the perforated circuit board . " <p> " Ow . I do n't know about that . " <p> She did n't look up . " Do n't you have a soldering iron ? " <p> " I have n't seen it in years . " They got up , and Carmine helped him down the back steps into the moonlit yard . Built onto the rear of the garage was a workshop . Mr. Boudreaux opened the door , and the glass in its top rattled . At one time he spent long hours here fixing the house 's appliances or rebuilding bicycles and gas-powered airplanes . Now he came in once or twice a year to look for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light switch . <p> " A workbench , " she sang , going over to a vise and turning its handle around . <p> Mr. Boudreaux looked for the soldering gun while she dusted the maple counter with a rag and spread out the components . " Here it is , " he said . But when he plugged the instrument in and pulled the trigger , a burst of sparks shot from the vents and a smell of melting Bakelite filled the shop . Holding it by its cord , he unplugged it and then threw it into the yard . The girl looked after the soldering iron sorrowfully . <p> " Do you have another one ? " <p> " No , honey . And it 's too late to go buy a new one . We 'll have to finish tomorrow . " He watched her look to the counter and purse her lips . " What you thinking ? " <p> " Sundays are not good days , " she told him . <p> He shook his head at the comment . " You 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leather shoes . " Mom and I have got to be there , and we 've got to stay quiet . " She looked up at him , and her face showed that she was smarter than he ever was . " We 've always got to be in the corner of his eye . " <p> " What 's that ? " He bent a furry ear toward her . <p> " He wants us around , but kind of on the side . Never the main thing he looks at . " <p> The old man looked up to a rusty sixteen-penny nail and took down his Turner gasoline blowtorch . " If this thing'II work , we 'll try to get our soldering done the old-fashioned way . " <p> She clapped her hands together once . " What is it ? " She put a forefinger on the brass tank . <p> " Well , you open it up here , " he told her , unscrewing a plug in the bottom and shaking out a few spoonfuls of stale , sweetsmelling gas . " Then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and use this little thumb pump on the side . " <p> " To make pressure ? " <p> " Yeah . Then you light the end of this horizontal tube and adjust the flame with these old knobs . " He dug around in a deep drawer under the counter , coming up with an arrow-shaped tool with a wooden handle on one end and an iron rod running out of that into a pointed bar of copper . " You got to set this heavy point in the flame , and when it gets hot enough , you touch it to the solder , which melts onto the wires . That 's what holds the wires together . " <p> The girl grabbed the wooden handle and waved the tool like a weapon , stabbing the air . <p> In a few minutes the blowtorch was sputtering and surging , humming out a feathery yellow flame . It had been over thirty years since Mr. Boudreaux had used such a torch for soldering , and it took several tries before the first wires were trapped in melted silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a circuit board , and for a minute , he was a younger man , looking down on the head of one of his own daughters . He felt expert as he guided Carmine 's short fingers and held the circuit board for her to thread the red wire through to the switch terminals . He felt back at work , almost as though he was getting things done at the mill . <p> The girl avoided his eyes , but did give him one glance before asking a question . " Why 're you helping me with this ? " <p> He guided her fingers as she threaded a wire under the board . " It just needed doing . " <p> " Did you really help your children with their projects ? " <p> " I do n't remember . Maybe their momma did . " <p> She was quiet as she turned in a stubby screw . " Did you ever have to do a science project ? " <p> He looked out the workshop window and closed one eye . " I do n't think science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she was n't smiling . Then he remembered something . " When I was in fifth grade I had to read a novel called Great Expectations . The teacher said we had to build something that was in the book , like an old house , or Miss Havisham 's wedding cake or some such foolishness . I forgot all about it until the night before and knew l was going to really catch it the next day if I showed up without it . " <p> Carmine took the hot copper away from the torch and soldered a connection herself . " What did you do ? " <p> He rubbed his chin . " I think I cried , I was so scared . My mother would whack me with a belt if I ever failed a course , and I was n't doing so good in English . Anyway , my daddy saw my long face and made me tell him what was wrong . He asked me what was in the book . " Mr. Boudreaux laughed . " I thought that was strange , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row . But I told him about Pip , and Pip 's father , and the prison ship . That caught his ear , and he asked me about that ship , so I told him . Then he went outside . That night I went to bed and could n't sleep hardly a wink . I remember that because I 've always been a good sleeper , l go out like a light about nine , ten o'clock , you know ? " The girl nodded , then turned a bulb into a socket . " When I got up for school , Daddy had left for work at the mill , and on the kitchen table was a foot-long sailing boat , painted black , three masts , deck hatches , gun ports , and a bowsprit , the rigging strung with black sewing thread . It was all done with a pocketknife , and it was warm to the touch because my momma said he had put it in the oven to dry the paint so it would be ready for school . " <p> The girl seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tied in with wire , " she said . <p> " The old man was like that , " Mr. Boudreaux told her . " He never asked me if I liked the boat , and I never said anything to him about it , even when I brought home a good grade for the project . " <p> When they were finished , all the light bulbs lit up as she predicted . He built a hinged wooden frame for the two posters that held her report and drawings . They set everything up on the workbench and stepped back . Mr. Boudreaux pretended to be a judge and clamped his fingers thoughtfully around his chin . " That 's a prize winner , " he said in a mock-serious voice . Then he looked down at Carmine . Her lips were in a straight line , her eyes dark and round . <p> The next day was Sunday , and Mr. Boudreaux went to eleven o'clock Mass , visiting afterward with the men his age who were still able to come out . They sat on the rim of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree and told well-worn jokes in Cajun French , then told tales of who was sick , who was dead . Mr. Landry , who had worked under Mr. Boudreaux at the sugar mill , asked him what he was doing with his granddaughter at the mall . <p> " That was a neighbor child , " Mr. Boudreaux told him . " My grandchildren live away . " <p> " What was she doing ? Asking you about the dinosaurs ? " He laughed and hit the shoulder of the man next to him . <p> " She 's doing a school thing , and I 'm helping her with it . " <p> Mr. Landry 's face settled into a question . " She lives on the north side of you ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> Mr. Landry shook his head . " My son works with her daddy . She needs all the help she can get . " <p> " He 's a piece of work , all right . " <p> The men broke up and moved away from each other , waving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the school , along the park , behind the ball field . He felt that by helping with the science project he had completed something important and that he and the girl had learned something . His old Buick hesitated in an intersection , and he looked at its faded upholstery , its dusty buttons and levers , thinking that he should buy a new car . He could cash in his insurance policy and finally use a little of his savings . <p> When he got home , even though he felt lightheaded , he began to clean out the glove compartment , search under the seats , empty the trunk of boots and old tools . He rested in the sun on his front steps , then decided to change into shorts , get the galvanized pail , and wash the car . He was standing in a pool of water from the hose , looking down at his white legs , when he heard the shouting begin next door . The mother 's keening yell was washed away by the drunken father 's roaring . The girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood on the withering lawn , looking back into the house . Mr. Boudreaux saw a wink of something white at the front door , and then the science project posters flew out onto the walkway , followed by the circuit board display and the little platform they had made for it . The father lurched down the steps , his unbuttoned white shirt pulled from his pants , his eyes narrowed and sick . He kicked the poster frame apart , and Carmine ran to avoid a flying hinge . She turned in time to see the circuit board crackle under a black shoe . <p> " Hey , " Mr. Boudreaux yelled . " Stop that . " <p> The father looked around for the voice and spotted the old man . " You go to hell " <p> Mr. Boudreaux 's back straightened . " Just because you ca n't handle your liquor do n't give you the right to treat your little girl like that . " <p> The father staggered toward him . " You old bastard , you got no right to try and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misfired once . The walk was so slippery he could n't even run away from the father , who was coming closer in a wobbly , stalking motion . He looked down at the father 's doubled fists . " You stay in your yard . If you give me trouble , I 'll call the cops . " The father gave him a shove , and Mr. Boudreaux went down hard in a grassy puddle . " Ow . You drunk worm . I 'm seventy-eight years old . " <p> " Leave us alone , " the father yelled . He raised a shoe , and for a moment the old man thought that he was going to kick him . Then the mother was at his side , pulling him away . <p> " Come back in the yard , Chet . Please , " she begged . She was not a small woman , and she had two hands on his arm . <p> Mr. Boudreaux squeezed the lever on the hose nozzle and sprayed the father in the stomach , and he stumbled backward against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You rummy . You a big man with old guys and little kids . " <p> " Screw you , old bastard . " The father shook water from his hair and tried to pull out of his wife 's hands . <p> " Aw , you a big man , " Mr. Boudreaux shouted , trying to stand up . When he finally was able to see over the roof of his Buick , the mother was pulling her husband up the steps , and Carmine was standing under a wilting magnolia tree , looking over at the fragments of her science project scattered along the walk . <p> Mr. Boudreaux 's lower back was sore . By eight o'clock he could n't move without considerable pain . He looked through his living room window at the house next door . He went out onto his porch and watched the light in Carmine 's bedroom window . Then he went in and watched television until nine . He adjusted the rabbit ears on his set and rolled the dial from station to station , not really paying attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the machine off and looked at it a long time , felt the cabinet , and tapped it with his fingers . Then he got a screwdriver , unscrewed the back , and peered in . Mr. Boudreaux pulled off all the knobs on the front , slid the works out of the case , and carried it over to his dining room table , placing it under the bright drop fixture . When he turned the works over , he smiled into the nest of resistors . He read the band values , and with a pair of pointed wire snips , removed several that bore two red bands and one black . Behind the selectors were two light sockets , and he cut these out , noting with a grimace that the bulbs in them drew too much power . <p> In the living room was his wife 's cabinet-model Magnavox HiFl . He slowly ran a finger along its walnut top . Then he pulled the knobs off and opened it up with a screwdriver , removing several feet of red and black wire , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voltage . The volume knob was a variable resistor , he now understood , and he removed that also . He went out to his workshop and took the little steel-tongued toggle switches off his old saber saw , his chain saw , his MoroTool . He needed one more and found that in the attic on a rusty set of barber 's clippers that had been his brother 's . Also in the attic he found his first daughter 's Royal manual typewriter . Mr. Boudreaux could type . He 'd learned in the army , so he brought down that , too . He emptied the new batteries out of a penlight he kept on his bedside table . They had bought extra sheets of poster board in case Carmine made a mistake while drawing the big resistors , but she had been careful . He dug the handwritten first draft of her report out of his trash can and penciled in the revisions he could remember . Then , on paper that was only slightly yellowed , he typed her report neatly , with proper headings . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , color-coded resistors traversed by round electrons with faces drawn on . His lettering was like a child 's , and this worried him , but he kept on , finishing up with instructions for operating the display . He drew in the last letter at two o'clock , then went out into the workshop to saw up a spruce two-by-four to make the poster frame again . He had no hinges , so he had to go to the cedar chest in his bedroom and remove the ones on the wooden box that held his family insurance policies . He mounted the posters with thumbtacks from an old corkboard which hung in the kitchen . The tacks ' heads were rusty , so he painted them over with gummy white correction fluid he 'd found in the box with the typewriter . <p> At four o'clock , he had to stop to take three aspirin for his back , and from the kitchen he looked across through the blue moonlight to the dark house next door , thinking maybe of all the dark houses in town where children endured the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the garage he found that there was no more gasoline for the old torch , which had whispered itself empty on the first project . On the front lawn , he cut a short length out of his new garden hose and siphoned fuel from his Buick , getting a charge of gas in his mouth , where it burned his gums under his dentures . Later , as the soldering tool heated in the aspirate voice of the torch , he felt he could spit a tongue of flame . <p> He ran the wires as she had run them , set the switches , mounted the light sockets , soldered the resistors in little silvery tornadoes of smoke . He found the bulbs left over from the first project and placed them into the sockets , wired in the battery , checked everything , then stepped back . The posters and display were duplicates of those the father had destroyed . Though the workshop window showed a trace of dawn , and though Mr. Boudreaux 's legs felt as though someone had shot them full of arrows , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pot of coffee and sat out in the dew on the front porch , waiting for the father to come out in his hurting , hungover fog , and drive away . At seven-fifteen , he was gone , and Mr. Boudreaux loaded the project into the back seat of his car , started the engine , and sat in it , waiting for the school bus . Carmine came out and waited by the garbage cans , and when the bus arrived , its seats stippled with white poster boards , for everyone 's project was due the same day , she looked up at the opened door , pushed her glasses up her nose , and got on . He followed the bus out of the neighborhood and down the long , oak-shaded avenue as the vehicle picked up kids in twos and threes , science projects at each stop . The farther he drove , the more fearful he became , thinking that maybe the girl would n't understand , or would think that he was doing this just to get back at her father , which in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought he 'd better pass the bus , turn around , and head home . But then what would he do with the project ? He would n't throw it away , and it would haunt him forever if he kept it . <p> The bus pulled into the school lot , and he followed it and parked . By the time he got to the covered walkway , children were pouring off , carrying jars of colored fluids , homemade generators , Styrofoam models of molecules . He had the bifold project in his arms , and when she came down the bus steps empty-handed , he spread it open for her . She stepped close and looked , lifted a page of the tacked-on report and checked the second , the third page . <p> " Where 's the display ? " she asked , not looking at him . <p> " It 's in the car here , " he said , sidling off to retrieve it . When he got back , he saw she had hitched her bookbag onto her shoulder and had the posters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , " she said , holding out her free hand , her face showing nothing . <p> He handed it to her . " You want me to help bring it in ? " <p> " No . How do the switches work ? " <p> He clicked one for her . " Up is on , down is off . " <p> She nodded , then squinted up at him . " I 'll be late . " <p> " Go on , then . " He watched her waddle off among her classmates , bearing her load , then he turned for his car . She could have called after him , smiled , and said thank you , but she did n't . <p> Because he was out so early , he decided to go shopping . He considered his options : the Buick lot , the appliance dealer 's , the hardware . After half an hour of driving around town slowly , he went into a department store and bought two small masonry pots filled with plastic flowers . They looked like the jonquils that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cypress fence . He drove to the old city graveyard , and he walked among the brick tombs and carefully-made marble angels , placing a colorful pot on the sun-washed slab of his father 's grave . His back pained him when he put down the flowers , and the bone-white tombs hurt his eyes as he turned completely around in this place where no one would say the things that could have been said , but that was all right with him . <p> <p> By TIM GAUTREAUX <p>
