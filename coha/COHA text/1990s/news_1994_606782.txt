<p> ACCORDING TO Dorothy Parker , the Algonquin Hotel 's legendary Round Table was nothing but a bunch of loudmouths showing off , the Roaring Twenties ought to have been called " The Dingy Decade " and as for her , a woman famous for being witty , she was " just a little Jewish girl trying to be cute . " There is a certain amount of truth  --  as well as self-loathing  --  in each of these harsh assessments . But while the mystique of Parker 's fellow lunching partners has faded over the years , hers remains persistently intact . <p> Since its initial publication in 1944 , " The Portable Dorothy Parker " has never gone out of print and , in the current edition , the somber-eyed portrait of Parker that used to be slightly larger than a postage stamp takes up the entire front cover , as if her intensity is no longer something that has to be contained . Although Parker assiduously avoided writing memoirs and left behind no diaries , that has n't stopped the production of several biographies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Alan Rudolph 's new film about her . God knows what Dorothy Parker would have made of Kurt Cobain ( she had trouble enough assessing Jack Kerouac ) , but the timelessness of her appeal seemed apparent when , in the aftermath of Cobain 's suicide in Seattle , a flyer circulated through the city bearing the Parker poem " Resume , " which lists the annoying drawbacks of various suicide methods and concludes , " You might as well live . " <p> Given all the ways in which Parker has stood the test of time , it 's perfectly understandable that for years now pundits ( usually male ) have rejoiced in pouncing upon some poor unsuspecting woman and labeling her " the contemporary Dorothy Parker . " Understandable , but completely misguided . How is it possible for someone to be the contemporary version of a woman who was , in so many respects , this culture 's first contemporary woman ? <p> Parker competed with men and insisted upon equal treatment not only in the workplace , but in the barroom and bedroom as well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , what could be more contemporary than that ? " Please God , " Parker typed in one of her frequent fits of dissatisfaction with her work , " make me stop writing like a woman . " Of course , had this request been granted , we would not still be talking about her . <p> Probably the most erroneous impression of Parker , held mostly by those familiar only with her most famous one-liners , is that she was a gay , flip , boozy chronicler of the decade that defined her just as relentlessly as she defined it . Such a view would have Parker attempting suicide , as she did on at least five separate occasions , just to keep the clever guys she drank with supplied with material : e.g. , " If you keep that up , Dottie , you might hurt yourself someday . " <p> In some quarters , Parker 's infatuations with death and alcohol might be part of what makes her so contemporary . Neither has fallen completely out of fashion since her demise , which was itself a testament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from natural causes in 1967 , when she was 73 . <p> What 's certain is that even a glancing survey of Parker 's light verse , short stories , theater and book reviews demonstrates how , as James Thurber wrote , " the wheels of her invention were turned by the damp hand of melancholy . " In all the different books detailing Parker 's life , the material about her that seems most dated and tourist-like  --  and there 's a lot that does  --  is the material that ignores this fact , so central to both her writing and emotional life . <p> In 1920 , Parker shared lofty literary aspirations with Robert Benchley , her loving best friend and managing editor at the first incarnation of Vanity Fair when she was beginning to make a name as a notoriously cranky theater critic . By the end of the ' 20s , the two of them could frequently be found sharing champagne at Polly Adler 's tony Manhattan brothel . <p> Almost as if providing ballast for Parker 's idealized vision of him as a frustrated but loyal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polly 's . He had also become such a well-known humorist that his one-time ambition to write a history of Queen Anne period humorists now sounds like part of his whimsical , self-deprecatory act . <p> Benchley claimed to have discovered he had no real talent for writing but could n't give it up because he was too famous . Parker 's dilemma was almost the opposite . Although she had proven the depth of her talent and sensibility as a short story writer , she was best known for producing what she called " doo-dads , " many of which were based directly on her proclivity for , in doo-dadese , " putting all my eggs in one bastard . " The irony of Parker and Benchley hanging out together in a fancy whorehouse could n't have been lost on either one of them . <p> As a writer , it 's easy for me to wonder how different things might have been for Parker if she had ever managed to finish the autobiographical novel she abandoned , not once but twice , before signing up in 1934 for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This Isle of Do-What's-Done-Before . " ( Does that sound contemporary ? ) Once she had been there long enough to appreciate the gulf that lay between what she wrote and the fragments of her sensibility that could be detected on-screen , her hefty paycheck became the thing that mattered most . <p> Parker did n't exactly waste her time in Hollywood . Along with Alan Campbell , a one-time actor who was both her second and third husband , Parker received a best screenplay nomination for the 1937 production of " A Star Is Born . " She put a lot of energy into leftist causes in general and the Screenwriter 's Guild in particular . A slow writer , Parker sweated just as much over Hollywood dreck as she did her finest short stories . But she felt guilty enough over ditching fiction to complain to F. Scott Fitzgerald about the impossibility of serving two masters . <p> From that point onward , Parker 's output dwindled , but she remained an icon for young women who dreamt of breaking into journalism and dazzling all the men around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Parker appeared in 1970 , however , one such woman , Nora Ephron , devoted her column in Esquire to denouncing Parker as a role model , promoting the comforts of sisterhood over the dubious distinction of being the only woman at the table . As much as I probably agreed with Ephron then , this now seems an easy sort of shot to take at someone who rose to prominence in an entirely different era . <p> In Parker 's heyday , few starkly personal literary novels were being written by her " sisters . " One of these was Zelda Fitzgerald , and we all know what happened to her . There 's a good chance that Parker 's novel  --  as far as she got with it , anyway  --  was truly terrible . But my hunch is that it could n't have been nearly so terrible as she undoubtedly thought it was . <p> " Big Blonde , " her best-known and most highly praised short story , describes the despairing days and drunken nights of Hazel Morse , a woman so like Parker that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second effort , with an overdose of carefully hoarded Veronal tablets . In a piece the New Yorker published last year to coincide with the centennial of Parker 's birth , it 's said that what makes " Big Blonde " so wonderful is Parker 's objectivity . Well , I 'm probably missing the point , but if I had been Dorothy Parker 's best friend  --  a thankless job , by all accounts , given the perversely familiar pleasure the motherless child in her took in feeling neglected  --  I 'd have encouraged her to write more out of her subjective experience , not less . I 'd have encouraged her to finish that novel . <p> Maybe Parker really was a sprinter by nature , not a marathon runner . Maybe completing a novel would have only deepened her depression instead of her talent . As it was , Parker ended her career the same way she began it , as an entertainingly scathing critic . It 's tempting to think that in her case , being a critic was part of what held her back as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what was n't . The Round Table was no Mermaid Tavern , and she , thank you very much , was no Edna St. Vincent Millay . <p> While it 's entirely in keeping with Dorothy Parker 's character to have set standards that virtually guaranteed she would never be able to please herself , she left ample evidence that at the core of her being lay a profound feeling for writing well . One way to measure its depth is to read her . Another is to listen to the impassioned turn her distinctly accented voice takes in an interview recorded several years before her death . <p> " Writing is the toughest way you can possibly take , " she says . " It 's the loneliest way there is . There you are , you and your paper  --  that 's all . And nobody puts on their paper what they really meant to be there . You ca n't do it , you ca n't do it . Is it too much to ask that you 're someday able to put something on your paper you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it yet , but I hope to . " <p> Hearing this for the first time , I promptly burst into tears . And to cadge a line from the ever-relevant lady herself , it 's impossible to enjoy a thing more than that . <p> Randy Sue Coburn , a Seattle-based writer , co-wrote the screenplay for " Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle .
