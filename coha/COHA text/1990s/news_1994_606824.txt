<p> In the past , banking industry officials dreaded being hauled before the House Banking Committee , where they might be lectured on such topics as the importance of community reinvestment or other regulatory requirements . <p> The midterm elections changed that . Those same officials now say they will look forward to testifying before the committee  --  on the importance of weakening such regulations . <p> The Republican takeover in November has reshaped the committee . It will convene in January with a new name , many new members and a radically different set of legislative priorities . But it also will have a moderate Republican leader , who is far from Democrats ' worst nightmare . Even consumer groups , upset by the elimination of the consumer credit and finance subcommittee , concede that things could be a lot worse . <p> Other House committees have been drastically altered by the Republican restructuring and agenda outlined in the " Contract With America . " But the renamed Banking and Financial Services Committee ( formerly known as the House Committee on Banking , Finance and Urban Affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the contract . And disputes before the committee , which in the past have generally split along industry rather than party lines , will probably continue to be free of partisan wrangling  --  except for one powder keg : Whitewater . <p> The change in committee philosophy is captured by the change in chairmen . Outgoing Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez ( D-Tex. ) is a populist who regularly railed against Federal Reserve monetary policies and called for more regulation , including consumer-protection rules more stringent than the banking industry has liked . Incoming chairman Jim Leach ( R-Iowa ) is a moderate Republican , a soft-spoken , thoughtful Princeton graduate and 18-year veteran of the committee , who has voiced support for the Fed for staying " above politics " and who has worried that too much regulation stifles the banking industry . <p> But the committee is likely to be at its partisan worst when the committee holds hearings on Whitewater next summer , according to Leach , who will discuss his agenda in further detail at a news conference today . " The Banking Committee in some ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ironically , we have in our jurisdiction the hottest political potato . " <p> Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato ( R-N.Y . ) , Leach 's counterpart on the Senate Banking Committee , has said he plans to hold hearings later in the legislative session . <p> Under Leach , the jurisdiction of the Banking and Financial Services Committee will not change much : The committee will still oversee the banking industry , housing and monetary policy , but now will be able to exercise some authority over the securities industry . The committee , which will have 27 Republican and 23 Democratic members , has shrunk by only one . The staff , which in 1993 consisted of just under 100 people , will be slashed by about one-third . <p> But the committee 's structure will change slightly . The committee , which used to have six subcommittees , will now have five : financial institutions and consumer credit ; capital markets , securities and government-sponsored enterprises ; housing and community opportunity ; general oversight and investigations ; and domestic and international monetary policy . Significantly , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial institutions panel , reassuring banks that they may not have to worry about hostile hearings like those Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II ( D-Mass. ) held last year on community reinvestment requirements and lending discrimination . <p> That change has consumer lobbyists worried . " I look forward to simply maintaining the consumer protections that we have , " said Susannah Goodman , legislative advocate at Public Citizen , the public interest lobby . " We 'll be lucky if we do that . " For example , she said , the committee probably will not hold hearings on provision of basic banking services , such as check cashing , to the poor , or on extending community reinvestment rules to non-bank lenders , including mortgage banks and credit unions .. <p> All that is fine with bankers , who hope Leach will roll back what they see as excessive rules . " There is going to be a serious look by the representatives at what in the consumer laws might be counterproductive , " said Edward Yingling , executive vice president for government relations at the American Bankers Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair lending enforcement by the Justice Department , which has drawn fierce industry criticism . <p> Leach may find himself under pressure from more conservative Republicans to pursue a more hard-line agenda , lobbyists and other congressional observers say . Conservative Republicans could try to push Leach to go much further , eliminating community reinvestment requirements , disclosure rules and other regulations that banks have long criticized . <p> No one is sure how Leach will react to that pressure . " Dear Mr. Leach , you 're Mr. Moderate , " said Public Citzen 's Goodman , " What are you going to do in the land of the Gingrich ? " <p> " Obviously within political parties on all issues there are differences of judgment , " Leach said in an interview . " The conservatives hold the vibrant edge for direction-setting in the Republican Party just as the liberals do in the Democratic Party , but America has historically found extremes unattractive . " <p> Leach said that " early in the Congress , perhaps on the first day , " he will introduce legislation to reform Depression-era @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lynch &; Co. , from owning or merging with a commercial bank and a commercial bank , in turn , from owning or merging with an investment bank . An effort to remove restrictions could pit big banks , which want to trade and underwrite securities , against securities firms , who say the additional competition would be fair only if they can in turn provide retail banking services . Previous efforts to change these laws have been stymied by Rep. John D. Dingell ( D-Mich. ) , chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee , but the Republican victory has removed that obstacle . <p> The battle lines in this debate  --  involving small banks , big banks and Wall Street  --  are typical , and they have little to do with party lines . In the past , on legislation Leach oversaw that will make it easier for banks to cross state lines , party politics were not a major factor , either . <p> Leach said he also plans to propose legislation on derivatives , the well-publicized financial instruments whose value is linked to  --  or " derived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment houses have voiced opposition to legislation that would restrict derivatives dealing , and regulators have echoed their concerns . <p> " The trouble with legislation is that it is very likely in this type of market to become rapidly obsolete , and could very readily become counterproductive to the required flexibility that we need to address the types of problems that we are addressing , " Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told a congressional committee two weeks ago . " This is a rapidly changing financial structure . " <p> " My own personal view is that derivatives are extremely useful instruments of finance , " Leach said . But serious losses resulting from excessive risk-taking or plain confusion about what determines derivatives ' value indicate that further oversight may be necessary , he added . <p> The committee also will consider reducing the number of bank regulators . Currently banks are regulated by three agencies  --  the Fed , the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency , and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .  --  and savings and loans are regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflicting and create excessive paperwork . The committee also will have to oversee the demise of the Resolution Trust Corp. , the agency that was created to deal with massive failures in the savings and loan industry and that will be absorbed by the FDIC at the end of next year . <p> Relatively low on Leach 's agenda is addressing a difference in the size of premiums paid by banks and thrifts for deposit insurance . The thrift industry has warned that because bank premiums will probably decline next year and thrift premiums will not , thrifts will be at a severe competitive disadvantage . If the premium differential is not eliminated , thrift executives say , profits would fall and some thrifts could be forced to close . <p> Further down the legislative pipeline is a new version of a " national treatment " bill that would require foreign governments to give U.S. banks operating abroad the same privileges foreign banks enjoy here . A version of that bill , which died in the Senate earlier this year , would have given the Treasury Department the power to deny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's home government discriminated against U.S. banks operating there . Although the expanded General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade passed by Congress earlier this month covers financial services for the first time , specific market-opening agreements remain to be negotiated . <p> Staff writer Peter Behr contributed to this report . <p> CAPTION : Rep. Jim Leach ( R-Iowa ) , an 18-year veteran , may find himself under pressure from more conservative Republicans to pursue a more hard-line agenda at the Banking Committee , lobbyists and other congressional observers say .
