Eighteenth-century Lt , wrought iron gates and a pleached hedge of European hornbeams define space and create " feelable rooms . " Photograph Yellow flag iris , hostas , and other perennials form a lush composition of contrasting colors and leaf shapes in this mixed border . // As Doug MacCarthy greets his garden , the details speak to himhosta leaves , sleek as wrapping paper and big as an elephant 's ears ; the musk of roses , luscious as dessert ; wind chimes singing in the branches of a maple ; the swirl of ironwork , glossy and hard . Anyone can see this is an extraordinary place . That is , except its owner . Doug was born with retinitis pigmentosa , a disease that causes progressive degeneration of the retina . For his first 32 years , he saw the world like you and I. He graduated from Princeton and became an accomplished builder . There came a day , however , when he could no longer read blueprints . He switched careers , went into banking , and later became a successful financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house with a lot of really bad ornamental wrought iron " in an affluent suburb of St. Louis . No garden to speak of existed , just a dozen pin oaks and a spacious , open lawn . But Doug and garden designer Charles Freeman perceived a blank canvas that needed painting . They 've now been painting for 16 years , fashioning a garden that appeals not only to the eye , but also to the ear , nose , and fingertips . They began by using walls and hedges to capture space out of wide-open nothingness and establish a series of garden rooms . " The concept works for me because it creates feelable , defined spaces , " explains Doug . " And for me , a defined space has a big advantage mentally-it stays put Once I walk the perimeter and determine what 's doing the enclosing-whether it 's a hedge or wall-and what 's in the enclosure , I have a mental note of what 's there . And when you 're blind , you live your life that way . You do n't like fluidity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Doug turns to his other senses , grown more acute since his blindness , to experience the beauty of his garden rooms . Sound proves his most valued guide . " I depend so heavily on sound , " he attests . " I miss a lot that you can see , but you miss a lot that I can hear . " To help Doug navigate , Charles placed a series of fountains at strategic points throughout the garden . Their gentle splash does more than soothe . Doug triangulates on the sound to pinpoint his location . Wind chimes , hung in the trees , also help . But they 're much less reliable , depending as they do on fickle breezes . Photograph ( Above ) Water trickles gently from the fountain into a lead basin in the perennial garden . Doug relies on the sounds of fountains to pinpoint his location . ( Inset ) Big-leaved hostas bordering the walk act as guides keeping Doug on the path . Massed plantings such as this one also simplify maintenance .

A hedged garden resonates . An open lawn retreats . A rush of sound pouring in denotes an open gate . Fragrant flowers contribute information that 's less immediate , though just as welcome . " I know the changing seasons by the changing smells , " says Doug . The honeyed procession begins in spring with lilac , sweet shrub , mock orange , and Korean spice viburnum . Roses , lilies , and hostas scent the summer nights . Sound , smell , and touch weigh heavily in this garden . We understand why . But the beauty of the place begs the question-why paint something wonderful for someone who ca n't see it ? The answer lies in the partnership between homeowner and designer . From the first , Doug took upon himself the design of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls and walks . " In the building business , I learned to see in three dimensions , " he notes . " I still do . I feel spaces . " Charles took charge of the plantings , devising lush compositions of flowers , ground covers , trees , and shrubs to provide yearround interest and delight visitors and friends . Many of Doug 's and Charles 's best ideas came from visiting other gardens . For example , Beatrix Farrand 's designs for Dumbarton Oaks in Washington , D.C. , provided blueprints for many of the walks . Vita Sackville-West 's famous gardens at Sissinghurst in England supplied the inspiration for the garden rooms . Photograph The intense perfume of Madame Isaac Pereire rose tells Doug it 's June . // Charles , relaxing by a fountain in the shade of a catalpa tree , says acting as Doug 's eyes during these trips honed his own skills as a designer . " When you have to verbalize every garden and describe what you 're seeing , it solidifies that image in your mind , " he explains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to retain memories of different gardens and translate them into reality here . " Were it possible to sip the day , today would taste like cognac . And in Doug MacCarthy 's garden , it sounds like morning , it smells like June , and it feels , I think , like serenity . <p>
