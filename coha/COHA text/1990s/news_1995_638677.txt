<p> LAKEWOOD - The question of whether to raise sales taxes and annex a site for a new courthouse and community center is at the center of a bitter battle for the Lakewood mayor 's chair between incumbent Linda Morton and Councilman Gene Motta . Motta decided to go after the mayor 's seat after David Bielby a real-estate broker and city gadfly said he persuaded Motta to take on Morton in the Nov. 7 election . Motta in the middle of his second four-year term as a councilman admitted that Bielby 's encouragement to run for mayor was " part of it " adding that he has received several calls from Lakewood residents outside his Ward 3 district who want Morton out of office . Last year the mayor promised to put ( the proposed annexation ) on the ballot and she did n't keep her promise " said Motta who wo n't lose his council seat if defeated for mayor in November . But Motta conceded that the full council not just Morton defeated the referendum with a 7-4 vote . Instead Bielby and his supporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ballot . If the sales tax is approved by a majority of Lakewood 's 73 200 voters the city will have the authority to sell $ 59.4 million in revenue bonds to build a new justice and community center on property adjacent to city hall at South Wadsworth Boulevard and West Alameda Avenue . The ballot question would allow the city to pay fair market price to the Bonfils-Stanton Foundation for the 48 acres commonly called the Belmar property . If no price agreement was reached the city would be required to condemn the property and acquire it through eminent-domain procedures in district court . I 'm running for mayor to support the ballot issue and to provide leadership we do n't have on council " Motta said . Morton opposes the proposed sales tax primarily because the money would go directly to the $ 59.4 million bond issue leaving nothing behind for other projects . Clearly the timing is wrong for this " Morton said . Among other things she said . " Villa Italia is against it . Equitable Real Estate owner of the Villa Italia Mall opposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belmar property and would like to put a Mervyn 's or Target store on the site to feed customers to Villa Italia . In 1993 however Lakewood voters defeated a proposed rezoning for a mix of commercial and residential development on the site . With this year 's ballot question Morton said her opponents want to buy the most expensive parcel of land in Lakewood . None of the costs for purchase and building the project were spelled out . It 's all very nebulous . " Bielby who heads the proposed sale-tax issue could n't predict what a fair market price for the property would be or how much of the construction would be included in the $ 59.4 million bond issue . Morton said the council already has agreed to spend $ 300 000 to lease city offices in the nearby Irongate building to relieve overcrowding . The bond issue would prevent city council from spending any portion of the sales-tax revenue on anything other than the acquisition or condemnation costs of the land and construction of the new centers . It also has a sunset provision that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With this proposal we have put in controls to spend the money on this location only and for municipal reasons " Bielby said . In an unusual repeat of history two Lakewood council candidates who are opposing each other this fall once served together on the Edgewater City Council . Bonnie Allison 59 served as a councilwoman and as Edgewater 's mayor in the mid-1970s with Louis Martinelli 60 who also was on council and served as mayor pro tem . Coincidentally they both eventuallymoved to Lakewood and the same council ward . In Arvada the races for mayor and three council seats appear for now to be sleepers . None of the candidates is taking personal jabs at the other . In Council District 2 incumbent Joanne Conte is seeking to retain her seat after a losing bid for the statehouse last fall . Conte who bills herself as Arvada 's only " full-time " council member has frequent and friendly telephone chats with her opponent Steve Urban whose slogan is " Urban stands for city . " Urban said he is n't running for Conte 's seat because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve the public " he said . I 've never done this before .
