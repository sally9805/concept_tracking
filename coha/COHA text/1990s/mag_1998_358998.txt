Lee Teng-hui , Taiwan 's first popularly elected President , talked with a group of TIME journalists last week . Excerpts : <P> TIME : President Clinton is expected to discuss Taiwan on his visit to Beijing . Does that worry you ? <P> Lee : I remain optimistic . Although Beijing will surely try to bargain very hard , I do n't believe the U.S. will make any concessions with regard to Taiwan because it is so important to the U.S. <P> TIME : Are you concerned that the U.S. might pressure Taiwan to move from talks with Beijing on technical issues to political issues like unification ? <P> Lee : It is impossible to distinguish between political issues and functional issues . It is not necessary to make that distinction . Our attitude toward dialogue is quite open . <P> TIME : Do you feel you can deal with Jiang Zemin and other Chinese leaders ? <P> Lee : The mainland 's basic policy toward Taiwan remains the same even though its tactics may appear more nimble . We look forward to Beijing 's extending its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy . <P> TIME : What do you think Beijing will do if the independence-minded Democratic Progressive Party gains power ? <P> Lee : Yes , Beijing is paying close attention to this issue . Its leaders ' focus should be directed not to the D.P.P. but to the people in Taiwan . If they keep trying to intimidate us and equate everything we do with so-called Taiwan independence  --  including foreign travel by our leadership and our participation in international relations  --  then our people will be alienated . That will lead to a greater desire for independence . <P> TIME : What will your relations with the mainland be like in 25 years ? <P> Lee : Mainland China will find it very difficult to maintain the nationalism and hegemonism that it relies on now for its rule . Society on the mainland will become more pluralized . In that case , cross-strait relations will grow closer than at present .
