The night he got mugged , Alan Lowe had stolen his manager Mr. Dugan 's long , hide-colored trench coat , which had been thoughtlessly left on the coat tree outside Dugan 's office . Alan knew he was doomed ; it was only a matter of time before Dugan fired him , so he thought : " Why not ? " He 'd been the last to leave that evening , and he 'd taken the coat off the hook as if lost in thought , swinging it casually over his arm . Afterwards , he 'd gone to a bar where he was sure he would n't see anyone he knew . He felt impressive and elegant in the coat . But by the time he left the bar , he had begun to worry again . He had to find some way to make Dugan like him . He had to find some way to hide how much he hated working at Pete Preneta and Co . He needed his job . He was thinking all this when he was thrown to the ground . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , he 'd awakened that morning in a cold terror over it . Apparently , he 'd been dreaming of his bills , because they were on a circular track in his head , like an image from a nightmare he 'd been startled out of . Even before he 'd showered or brushed his teeth , he found himself at his desk with all his bills piled in front of him , calculating . It was the first time in his life that he saw no escape from his own irresponsibility , and he panicked . <p> There were utility bills and rent that would be due in a few days . There was a government loan from college that was several months past due , but he had n't really looked at it carefully . DEMAND FOR PAYMENT , it said . He had three credit cards that had already reached their limit , and a few days before a waitress came slinking back to his table to inform him that Visa had instructed her to retain his card . He saw that even if he sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't change very much : the rate of interest was too high . That morning he 'd sworn to do something . But that evening , after he 'd stolen the trench coat , he 'd used a credit card to buy some drinks . One last time , he 'd thought . <p> In the comic version of the story , Alan was a typical , wide-eyed Nebraska boy , and it took him a long time to register what was actually happening . The men grabbed him around the neck and waist , and as he was thrown to the ground he was aware of his arms and legs waving languidly as tentacles . " Wait a minute , " he shouted . " Hold on , I 'm slipping . " That was when he struck the pavement and one of his attackers kicked him in the head . <p> Afterward , when he described the mugging to his co-workers and to his family back home , he found himself leaving out a good deal of what had really occurred . For example , he kept the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kick him over and over , shouting , " Where 's the money ? " But he did n't mention that as the men continued to kick him he 'd cried , " Momma , " and , " Oh , Mom , please help me , " with each blow . The character he played in the story had a certain dry wit , enduring the attack with a startled , dignified innocence . When , in the story , the men shouted : " Where 's the money ? " the narrator responded : " I spent it ! " He did n't want anyone to picture him as he often saw himself : squirming through the bits of garbage on the sidewalk , weeping , calling out for his mother . He did n't want them to imagine him playing dead less than two blocks from his apartment , his cheek pressed into a pool of his own vomit , staring at the things scattered in the patches of scrubby winter grass : a chicken bone , cigarette butts , the neck of a broken ketchup bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it made him actually dizzy with humiliation . <p> He was n't seriously injured , though he looked terrible the next day , his face covered with bruises and scabs . His ribs and head were sore from being kicked , but he was sure nothing was broken : It would have hurt more if there was , he thought . The policemen who 'd come to his apartment later , after he 'd managed to run the few yards to his door and call them , had suggested he go to the emergency room , just to be safe . But he refused . He did n't have any insurance , and he knew how much those things cost . <p> The truth was , the policemen were somewhat annoyed with him . He was n't able to tell them what the men looked like , and he was n't even sure in what direction they 'd run off . The policemen kept exchanging ironic looks . <p> " You gay ! " one of the men had asked him , and when Alan exclaimed , <p> " Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's who they tend to go after , " the policeman had said pointedly . " Fags . " <p> " I have a girlfriend , " Alan told them . <p> He and Sandy had n't dated in almost six months . But he did consider calling her that night . It would have been nice to have someone sleep over . There was a telephone pole outside his window , with rusty metal stakes driven into it so someone could climb up . In the next few days , he began to dream that he woke to find a face peering in his third-floor window , a grimacing man with a knife clenched in his teeth like <p> pirate . And when he was outside , even in a crowd , he often felt as if the space around him were shimmering , as if at any moment the people nearby might grab him and throw him onto the cement , kicking him with their sharp shoes . <p> At least it was a good story , one he could tell exceptionally well . The morning after he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the older secretary , the one who always called him " honey " and " sugar , " was very concerned about the neighborhood he lived in . When she first saw his face , she 'd let out a small cry of shock . Even Dugan had listened to Alan 's story , and Dugan , who was white , like Alan , said he was reminded of the time he himself was held up on the el platform by five Puerto Ricans with knives . Dugan pulled up his shirt to show them a pale , leech-like scar above his left nipple . They 'd tried to stab him in the heart . " Luckily , " Dugan said , " I do n't have one . " <p> As they all listened to Dugan , Alan found himself wondering what Dugan and his co-workers were thinking of him . There were often times when he would feel as if he were lifting out of his body and observing himself from above . He could see himself clearly at this particular moment , standing there in a business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a Brooks Brothers suit , it was ill-fitting , and he was certain that everyone could tell that it was used . They were polished , had gone to fancy schools , had rich parents . They were going to be wealthy and successful , and Alan was n't . Though he was twenty-two , he looked younger : big and gangly like a teenager who had n't yet grown into his body , with a round freckled face and cheeks that would not grow hair . His smile was broad and simple . He looked , people told him , like he was from Nebraska ; a redneck , as someone had once unkindly put it . Standing there , he was aware that each of his co-workers had probably developed an unflattering version of him in their minds . <p> The co-workers were generally cordial , though , even if they were n't friendly . They kept their opinions to themselves , unlike Dugan , whose advice to Alan had the jovial , insulting edge of a football coach . " Lowe , " he 'd said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a teamster . What the hell is that , Old Spice ? " It was  --  a Christmas gift from his father , who was , in fact , a teamster . " Lowe , " Dugan would say , " do you own an iron ? " Or : " From now on , Lowe , do n't bring a brown-bag lunch . You want the clients to think you 're Bob Cratchit ? " <p> Dugan was a small burly man in his mid-forties ; the backs of his hands and fingers were covered with dark bristly hair , and the day after the mugging , when Dugan leaned the ham of his palm against the top of Alan 's computer , it seemed his hair had a burnished glow , as if he 'd moussed it . " Lowe , " he said , in a confidential , fatherly voice . " Look , I do n't want to seem insensitive or anything , but you 've got to get some more professional-looking bandages , man . We ca n't have clients coming in here and seeing you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Car Accident . " <p> Alan looked up . He had been staring at the blinking cursor on his computer for well over half an hour , and he did n't want Dugan to see how blank his screen was . " What ? " he said . <p> Dugan told him again . He hated having to repeat himself ; he 'd take on the expression of a comic who had to explain his punch line . " This is the name of a drugstore on Superior , " Dugan said , and handed him a slip of paper . " I 'm sure they have something decent . Where 'd you get that stuff ? Woolworth 's ? " <p> " I just had a first-aid kit at home , " Alan said , and Dugan nodded , flexing his hand as Alan smiled sorrowfully . The hot core of loathing Alan felt for Dugan was often cooled by the knowledge that Dugan was probably right . In his own way , maybe Dugan was really trying to help him . And everyone else on the floor seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employees , little private jokes , and Alan would watch them laughing together beyond the glass wall of his cubicle . Some of them even called Dugan " Dave . " <p> " I 'll take care of it , " Alan said agreeably . He gave Dugan a thumbs up , having seen Dugan do this himself on occasion , and tucked the slip of paper into his pocket . But Dugan just stared at him . <p> " Good man , Lowe , " he said . <p> Sometimes Alan imagined that it was a small thing , a matter of shifting his attitude a few degrees to the right or left . Then Dugan and the rest of them would accept him . He had not been unpopular in college ; he 'd been in a fraternity , had even been elected secretary . He 'd been the only guy in his house to date a Tri-Delt , the most beautiful sorority on campus . And though his girlfriend Sandy had eventually decided she was really more interested in women , she still liked him ; as did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never commented on his clothes . <p> A terrible thing had happened to him when he graduated from college , he sometimes felt : a part of him had been stripped away , exposing the soft , ugly inside . That autumn , a homeless man had walked up to him and spit in his hair , for no reason . Apparently , the man just had n't liked his looks . Another time he 'd been by himself in a restaurant , sipping coffee , when a smartly-dressed , grandmotherly woman had glared at him from a nearby table . " Please do n't watch me while I 'm eating , sir , " she said coldly . And even his old friends from college called him less frequently . They had jobs they were settling into , new lives . <p> So why was n't Alan settling in as well ? What was wrong with him ? <p> In the mornings , he always resolved that his day at work would be a good one . Even that day , the morning after he was mugged , he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eager , the Pete Preneta and Co . Person they often spoke of in their memos . He loved the moment when he reached the elevator banks , the brush of shoulders as a group of people moved toward the opening doors , the sudden tingling in the pit of his stomach as the elevator glided upward . This was how he used to imagine himself when he was in high school , when he was riding in the passenger seat of his father 's pickup with empty beer cans and .22 shells rattling on the floor . He would see himself in a suit and tie , sitting down at a desk on the upper floors of a skyscraper ; he would see himself rich , his office full of gold-plated pens , large , intricate mahogany globes and a silver-leafed appointment book . <p> He sat at his desk and took the stack of papers from the in-box , smoothed and straightened them in the center of his desk . But when he looked down , it seemed as if these were the exact same memos and computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd only been working there for six months , but already it seemed there was no discernible beginning , middle or end . Minutes and words began to melt into one another with the hallucinatory tedium of a lava lamp . By ten , Alan would find himself falling into dreams , his eyes closed , his fingers poised above his keyboard as if in brief , brilliant thought . <p> He spent a little time applying his new bandages in the shining , brassy bathroom . Dugan had been right : the old ones looked awful-dingy . A crust of blood had appeared through the gauze he 'd taped to his forehead . But after he 'd finished , the afternoon extended like a dark tunnel in front of him , and he found himself on one of the long errands he often felt compelled to make at this time of day . <p> That afternoon , he 'd gone to the supply closet . He did this usually once or twice a week , and if he was lucky he would kill almost an hour collecting fine-point felt pens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to notice how much he took , just as no one seemed aware of how little work he 'd done , or where he was at any given point in the day . He always left his desk in a bit of a clutter , as if he 'd be returning any minute ; but no one , not even Dugan , seemed to be watching him . It was strange , he thought , because there had been no mention of Dugan 's missing trench coat , either . Perhaps Dugan had forgotten about it . <p> At home , after he had put away his cache of office supplies , he tried on the trench coat again . He had hurried back to his apartment in the waning late January light , his back prickling as the streetlights began to hum , turning blue in the dusk . He 'd jumped when a dour young woman had rushed past him on the sidewalk . Now , it was dark , and he pulled down the shades in all three rooms , fingering the black buttons of the trench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could see the trench coat had been ruined by the attack . It was wrinkled , scuffed with dirt . The sleeve had been torn a little , and the collar marked like a map with dark islands of blood . He doubted that a dry cleaner could bring it back to life , now . <p> He was in the habit of going out at night , sometimes with his old college friends , but most often these days , alone . There were a couple of bars he frequented  --  quiet , bluesy places that made him feel there was a certain melancholy elegance to drinking by himself ; there was an Italian restaurant he liked , and a Thai place . Sometimes he 'd go to a movie or shop at a big used-record store he knew . This was city life : he was independent , faceless , and yet always a part of some larger organism  --  like coral . <p> But tonight , he felt too nervous to go out . His muscles tingled as if something were about to pounce from the darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was no answer , only the sound of rings , each one like the threatening purr of a cat . <p> The next day , rent was due . But he did n't have enough money in his account , and he had even tried calling his parents . " Boy , I know it can be tough financially those first few years out of college , " his father had said . " You know we 'd help you out if we could , but we just ca n't . " He could n't bring himself to tell his father how desperate things were . How would he explain where his money had gone when he did n't know himself ? <p> He decided that rather than panic , he would just have to wait a few weeks until his next paycheck . Then he would just go without groceries for a while , that was all . He tried not to let himself imagine his debt rolling over and over , accumulating . It would be all right , he told himself . <p> He was thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he rounded the corner on the way to work and bumped into two boys . They had been walking close together , their shoulders almost touching , and he stepped into them as if into an invisible wall . <p> " Oh , " he said . " Excuse me ! " He grinned . They seemed young , maybe seniors in high school . <p> " You better take care , mister , " said the taller of the two . " Your head in the clouds . " <p> " Yes , well , " he said , a bit flustered . They were at the mouth of an alleyway , near a liquor store that had n't opened yet . In the distance , people were striding toward the rapid-transit station . " I guess I 'm a little spaced out , " he said . " Sorry . " The boys exchanged glances , and it was then that he began to have a feeling . He had n't been able to see his muggers  --  it was too dark and fast  --  but an image flashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he had the sudden intuition that these boys were his attackers . It was the way they looked at each other , as if trying not to chortle ; it was the way they had their eyes fixed on him . Yet they were so young and clean-cut . He told himself not to be paranoid . <p> " How much do you want for those sunglasses ? " the taller one said . <p> He was wearing a pair of yellow-tinted sunglasses that made him , he thought , look sort of hip . Sandy had given them to him . He took them off , and he sensed how easy it would be for the boys to pull him into the alleyway . He put his fingers on the grate across the liquor-store window . " They 're not for sale , " he said . " Thanks for offering . " <p> " I 'll give you ten dollars for them , " the taller one said . The boys smiled , and Alan watched as the taller one took a black leather wallet out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black wallets , Alan told himself . But it looked very much like the one the muggers had taken from him . <p> " Those are the nicest sunglasses I 've ever seen , " said the boy . <p> " No , no , " Alan said . " Seriously . They have sentimental value . " The two boys stood there , and Alan wondered whether he could grab something  --  a blade of broken glass , a stone  --  to fend them off . Then they turned . " Stay cool , " the smaller one said . When they turned the corner , walking toward the space of ground where he 'd been mugged , he thought he heard them laugh . <p> This was not a story that would amuse people , he thought : it made him sound insane . Often , he would finish relating some anecdote and the silent faces of his co-workers or friends would be like the heavy ticking of a clock . It made him cringe . Once , he 'd told someone about the time he had worms as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but afterward , when he was alone , he was so filled with disgust at himself that he 'd struck his idiot mouth with his fist , making it bleed . Once , he was trying to tell Sandy about the Pete Preneta Trainee Week  --  how the company had shipped them all to Atlanta , where they lived in dorms and learned about Firm policy  --  but Sandy stopped him halfway through . She shook her head . " You know what 's weird , " she said . " You 're not who you think you are . " She would n't explain what she meant . <p> Alan gazed out the window of the train . He 'd taken this trip hundreds of times now , but nothing ever looked familiar . They could be taking him anywhere . At some corners , buildings slid by only a few feet from the window ; walls shuffled past in a blur of colors and textures  --  grimy red brick or wood or ancient brownstone , the crowns and curlicues and stylized letters of gang graffiti , billboard models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there would be a flash of open sky , and an empty school yard would appear , or a street , tunneling its way toward Lake Michigan . Then , just as abruptly , the train descended into the underground , and there was only darkness , or in a sudden flicker of light , the crumbling damp walls and shadowy nooks and crannies of the subway . The train conductor mumbled out the names of the stops in bursts of static over the PA system , but Alan could never understand the words . Often , it was n't until he recognized his stop that he was sure he was n't going the wrong way . <p> The rent-of course it came back to him in the middle of the day , while he was trying to talk to Dugan . There was this buzz in his head , like interference from a distant station on the radio . <p> " So  --  like , my father , " Alan was telling Dugan , " is in the unions ? An organizer . He 's , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation had started , how it had led into this lie about his father . <p> " What union ? " Dugan said . He seemed vaguely interested , turning the heavy gold ring on his finger around and around . <p> " Teamster , " Alan said quickly . " A real old-time progressive , you know . " <p> " The unions are dying fast , " Dugan mused . He looked at Alan pointedly , and Alan tried to remember where the conversation had been going before this terrible detour . It had been something about Dugan 's parents . <p> " Well ... yeah , " Alan said . " That 's what I tell him . He 's always giving me crap about working here , for a corporation and all . But I tell him , you know , this is the nineties . " This was one of Dugan 's phrases , and Alan waited a moment for some slight acknowledgment . <p> " Hmmm , " Dugan said . This was the longest and most personal conversation Alan remembered he and Dugan ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , anyway , " Dugan said . <p> " Hey , " Alan said . " You know what I wanted to ask you . " He hesitated for a moment , but the buzz in his head had grown loud enough that he thought he could risk it . " You know those emergency loans they talk about in the employee handbook ? " <p> " Yeah ! " Dugan said . <p> " How do you get one ? " <p> Dugan considered him , his expression flickering . He looked suspicious , and Alan could sense that the rapport had been killed . So that 's why he came to my office , Dugan was thinking . " What 's the emergency ? " Dugan said at last . <p> " I do n't know , " Alan said weakly . " I 'm out of money ? " <p> Dugan 's face was blank for a long second . Then , as if Alan 's voice had just reached him from a long distance , he chuckled . " Nice , Lowe , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , on a Saturday , Alan saw Dugan walking down a street . This was in Alan 's neighborhood , far from the Gold Coast condo where Dugan lived . What was he doing here , Alan wondered , and he felt a trickling sensation go through him . He 'd never before seen someone from work in the civilian world , and there was something unsettling about it . He saw Dugan come out of an occult bookstore wearing a thick leather jacket with a fur collar , striding slowly , purposefully away from him . He waited for Dugan to get a bit ahead of him , then he followed . <p> It was an unseasonably warm day for January , and Alan had been wandering the street all morning , trying to stay out of the apartment for fear his landlord would come looking for him . But he 'd felt edgy and vulnerable out in the open , and he 'd been trying to stick close to people . For a while , he 'd browsed in windows beside an elderly lady in heavy makeup and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would think she was his mother , and he tried to look bored and impatient . It was n't long before he 'd made her nervous , however , and she hurried away . <p> He 'd followed Dugan a few blocks when he remembered that he was wearing the trench coat . The realization branched across his skin like frost : it was impossible , but he had actually forgotten that it was stolen . When he paid for the dry cleaning , it had been as if he 'd purchased the coat . It felt like he 'd always owned it , now . <p> He stopped and swiftly shed the coat . For a moment , he considered stashing it somewhere . But of course it would be stolen . He folded it a couple of times , and then rolled it up tightly , as his father had taught him to roll sleeping bags , on camping trips when he was a child . He bent down and picked up a piece of newspaper that was lying on the street , wrapping it carefully around the bundled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm , it looked like he was just carrying a newspaper  --  the Sunday edition , but a paper nevertheless . <p> Dugan had stopped too . He was peering into a storefront window , absently drumming his thighs with the heels of his hands , as if trying to remember a rune . From a distance , Dugan 's mouth looked odd , doll-like . It took Alan a minute to realize Dugan was whistling . <p> Alan hung back . He knew he should take his opportunity , turn back before Dugan caught sight of him . And yet there was something exciting about this . For once , it was as if he knew more than everyone else on the street , he had his own secret purpose . He was transformed into someone shadowy yet magnetic , someone larger . Maybe this was what his muggers had felt . <p> Dugan was completely unaware . He walked on , pausing sometimes in front of a store . Where was he going ? Alan cruised easily around the little islands of walking people , sometimes letting Dugan drift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned , he would surely see him . But he did n't turn . <p> At the end of the block , Dugan went into a coffee shop . When Alan got to the entrance , he peered in the doorway just in time to see the hostess leading Dugan to a booth . The angry-looking Greek man at the cash register looked over at Alan . Alan smiled . He 'd been in this coffee shop several times , and the man , the owner apparently , was always nasty to him . <p> " You coming in or going out ? What ? " the man said to him . " You want me to heat the whole world ? " Alan pulled back uncertainly , but he surprised himself by giving the man the finger . Then he went out quickly , imagining for a moment that the man might come after him . But the man just waved a tired hand at him , making an ugly face from beyond the glass doors . Alan tapped his crotch , as he 'd seen disgruntled people do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stepped back a few paces , out of the man 's line of vision , and leaned against the wall . He did n't want to get in a confrontation and risk drawing Dugan 's attention . <p> But he was pleased with himself . " Heat this " : it was a very urban thing to say , the kind of response Dugan himself might have for such a person . Generally , Alan never thought of quick comebacks until long after the fact ; often they would come to him when he was trying to go to sleep , and he lay there with his eyes open . <p> People walked by and he looked at their shoes . Sandy had once told him that if you make eye contact with people on the street , you 're asking for trouble : that was in July , when he 'd nodded at a man in a big Russian-style fur hat as he and Sandy came out of a bar . The man had followed them for blocks , asking for money , and they had n't been able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally given up on them . " What 's wrong with you ! " Sandy had said afterward . " Do you like being harassed ? " But it was hard to avoid looking into people 's faces ; often he 'd find himself smiling and saying " Morning " to those he passed , as his father used to on the streets of their small town . <p> But now , he did n't look up . He leaned back against the wall , hardening his face , narrowing his eyes as if he were concealing <p> weapon . It made him smile a little to imagine that some redneck was walking by , trying not to look at him . <p> When Dugan came out , that warm sensation of menace rose up in Alan like a rush of adrenalin . It was the opposite of what he 'd been feeling on the street for weeks now . He followed Dugan again . The people strolling by seemed as vulnerable and trusting as the pigeons that waddled around statues downtown , moving out of the paths of passersby so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It would n't feel bad to kick Dugan , he thought . There was something annoyingly mincing about the way he walked . He was so proud of those dainty , slipper-like Italian shoes , with their ridiculous sheen , and Alan could tell he was keeping an eye on the ground to avoid stepping in something that might mess them up a little . It would n't feel bad to take a blowtorch to those shoes . <p> Nothing bad could ever happen to Dugan : that was how he acted , that was what he said with his pace and his whistling . He would never lock eyes with a crazy man on the street ; such a person did n't quite exist in Dugan 's dimension . He never shuddered as strangers brushed past . Not even a knife in the heart could faze him . Alan 's hands were shaking , but it was a good feeling . When he was little , his father imagined he was going to be an athlete , and taught him how to box . If he let down his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face or chest , and by the end of a session , Alan 's hands would be shaking like that . " You got the butterflies ? " his father would say , feigning punches . " You nervous ? " That was good , his father told him . It meant his body was getting him prepared . <p> Prepared for what ? <p> He was n't going to do it , he thought . But then Dugan was slowing down , flexing his shoulders luxuriously , as he always did when he 'd made some nasty comment . Nice , Lowe . Very cute , Alan thought , and then he knew he was going to do it after all . They had strolled off the busy street , away from the shops and people , and when Alan saw Dugan turn down a narrow alleyway , toward a parking lot , Alan quickened . <p> He felt his hand pull the trench coat from under his arm ; he worked swiftly to unravel it as he came up on Dugan , stretching it out , and just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alan pulled the coat over his head from behind . <p> This muffled Dugan 's surprised cry ; Alan jerked back on the coat , and he could see the shape of Dugan 's face , like a mask emerging on the surface of the canvas . It was easy to knock him to the ground . Alan had once helped one of his father 's friends clip the ears of his calves , and this was much easier than throwing a calf . Dugan struck earth , and Alan landed on his back with both knees , knocking the wind out of him . <p> " Help ! " Dugan gasped , and Alan struck him with his fist . <p> " Shut up ! " Alan said in a deep voice . He was trying to imitate a street accent , but it came out more like a Southern one . " I 've got a knife , you motherfucker , and I 'll use it . " <p> " This is a busy street ! " Dugan cried . " Someone will be coming ! " His voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coat around Dugan 's neck , creating a sort of bag over Dugan 's head . But when he realized what Dugan was saying , it made sense : he had to hurry . They were kneeling beside a trash dumpster , and he maneuvered behind it with Dugan still beneath him , shoving toward the blackened back wall of the building as one might push off from a dock . Dugan 's hands clawed the cement , and Alan picked up a long shard of broken glass and pressed it against Dugan 's back . <p> " You think you 're so great , " Alan said through his teeth . " You really need to suffer a little , man . " His accent wavered , and he knew he should n't talk ; Dugan would surely recognize his voice . Alan pressed the glass harder against Dugan 's back , and Dugan let out a small shriek , though he was n't cut . <p> " For the Love of God , " cried Dugan . " I 've got money ! Credit cards ! Take them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dugan 's pocket and draw the wallet out . <p> But that was n't what he wanted . He did n't know what he wanted , really , or how this could possibly have happened . He could feel the adrenalin ebbing away , and he felt as if Dugan was a raft he was kneeling on , adrift on the open sea . <p> He did want Dugan to suffer  --  but there was nothing he could bring himself to do that would hurt him enough . He wished he could think of some word , something that would go straight through Dugan 's heart as no weapon could . <p> " You ... " he said , and he hoped his voice boomed . But he could n't think how to finish the sentence , and there was n't time to ponder it . " Say ' Momma , ' " Alan said at last , and Dugan paused for a moment , then did . <p> " Momma , " Dugan said woodenly . <p> Alan wanted to make him repeat it with more conviction , but his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could think was to reach down and pull off Dugan 's shoes . He was n't wearing socks , and his pale feet lay there like beached fish . Alan slipped his belt off and knotted it tightly around Dugan 's ankles . That would give him time to run , he thought , and he could picture himself melting into the groups of people on the distant street , walking lightly in Dugan 's shoes , off toward where the train was pulling into the station , waiting to bear him away . <p>
