<p> A dozen airlines are offering free tickets , first-class upgrades or double or triple mileage to members of their frequent-flier programs . <p> The promotions , which kicked off two weeks ago , continued to gain steam last week as more airlines rushed to hook passengers and outdo or match the competition . <p> The result : Greater options for travelers . <p> Most carriers are giving passengers free tickets for flying as few as two round trips by March 15 . Other carriers - TWA , Pan Am , Southwest Airlines and Alaska Airlines - are offering double or triple mileage instead . <p> Who has the best deal ? " It 's hard to say , " says Randy Petersen , publisher of Frequent , a frequent-flier newsletter . " The TWA offer and the Pan Am thing are probably just a little bit better . But I do n't know if they 're anything you 'd want to jump ship for . " <p> Petersen says the mileage promotions might benefit more people because they do n't carry minimum flight requirements or restrict the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credits earned from these programs can be added to existing credits that passengers had accumulated with the same carrier , he says . <p> Airlines are hoping that the promotions will shore up traffic this month and the first three months of next year . The first quarter is traditionally a slow travel period for the industry . <p> Before signing up , passengers should read the fine print . Restrictions and other conditions apply . Here are a few that could affect you : <p> - Do n't sweat it if you do n't already belong to a frequent-flier program . To take advantage of the offers , travelers can sign up at an airline 's ticket office or the airport ticket counter or call the airline directly . Unlike other carriers , American Airlines has set a Jan. 15 deadline for when new members can join its latest promotion . <p> - These offers do n't cover very cheap airfares . Passengers at United Airlines , for example , must pay a minimum of $ 200 per round trip to earn credit toward its promotion . At Northwest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't qualify . <p> - There is a limit on how many awards passengers can earn . Midway , for example , says members of its frequent-flier program can earn a maximum of only three round-trip tickets . Other airlines have similar guidelines . <p> - When a carrier says you can transfer your free ticket to a friend or relative , drill the airline for more information . The transfer might not be as simple as it sounds . At Northwest , a passenger who hands over a freebie still has to travel with the friend or relative . <p> - Of course , seats for free-travel awards are limited and might not be available on all flights . Also , the offers are subject to change , so call the airlines before booking . <p> TEXT OF GRAPHIC <p> Frequent- Carrier flyer plan Fly Earn Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan NA Triple mileage Qualifying dates 12/15/90-3/15/91 Travel dates NA Blackout dates NA American AAdvantage 3 round trips or 1 coach round tri 8 segments 2 coach round trips 5 round trips or 3 coach round trips <p> 14 segments <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Travel dates 5/15/91-12/31/91 Blackout dates June 29 ; July 7 ; Nov. 23-24 , 27 ; Dec. 1-2 , 20-23 , 26 , 28-29 , 1991 Continental OnePass 3 round trips 1 coach round trip or 8 segments 2 coach round trips 5 round trips or 3 coach round trips 14 segments 2 first-class round trips <p> 7 round trips or <p> 20 segments <p> 9 round trips or <p> 24 segments Qualifying dates 12/15/90-3/31/91 Travel dates 5/15/91-2/12/92 Blackout dates June 28-29 ; July 3,7 ; Nov. 22-23 , 26-27 ; Dec. 1-2 , 19-23 , 26-29 , 1991 Delta Frequent Flyer 8 segments 1 coach round trip or 14 segments 3 first class upgrades 20 segments 2 coach round trips or 6 upgrades <p> 3 coach round trips or <p> 9 upgrades Qualifying dates 12/15/90-3/15/91 Travel dates 5/15/91-12/31/91 Blackout dates Nov. 22-27 , 30 ; Dec. 1-2 , 22-24 , 28-30 , 1991 N/A for upgrades Eastern OnePass 1 corporate rate round trip 1 round trip weekend for $ 91 <p> 2 corporate rate round trips 1 coach round trip <p> 3 corporate rate round trips 1 unrestricted coach <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feb. 14-16 , 18 , 23-24 ; March 22-24 , 28 ; April 1,7 ; May 24 ; July 3,7 ; Nov. 27 ; Dec. 1-2 , 19-21 , 26-29 <p> Midway Flyers First 3 round trips or 8 segments 1 coach round trip 5 round trips or 2 coach round trip 14 segments 3 coach round trip 7 round trips or <p> 20 segments Qualifying dates 12/15/90-3/15/91 Travel dates 5/15/91-12/18/91 Blackout dates May 24 , 27-28 ; July 3-5 ; Aug. 30 ; Sept. 2-3 ; Nov. 27-30 ; Dec. 1-2,19-31 , 1991 <p> Northwest WorldPerks 3 round trips or 8 segments 1 coach round trip 5 round trips or 2 domestic round 14 segments trips or 1 round trip to Europe 7 round trips or 3 round trips or 20 segments 1 round trip to Hawaii Qualifying dates 12/25/90-3/25/91 Travel dates 5/1/91-12/15/91 ( domestic ) 9/11/91-12/11/91 ( Europe , Hawaii ) Blackout dates Nov. 22-Dec. 1 , 1991 Pan Am WorldPass NA Triple Mileage Qualifying dates 1/3/91-3/28/91 ; 3/1/91-4/30/91 ( S.
