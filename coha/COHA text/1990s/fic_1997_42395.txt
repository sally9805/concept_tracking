How could she win an argument against somebody with an early training in propaganda ? She had to resort finally to the truth , that rinky-dink little boat in the great sea of persuasion <p> IT was dusk ; the campus had turned to velvet . I walked the brick path to Humanities , which loomed there and seemed to incline toward me , as God does toward the sinner in the Book of Psalms . It was late on a Friday afternoon , when the air is fertile , about to split and reveal its warm fruit-that gold nucleus of time , the weekend . Inside , up the stairs , the door to Stasselova 's office was open , and the professor lifted his head . " Oh , " he said . " Yes . " He coughed , deep in his lungs , and motioned me in . He had requested this visit earlier in the day , following class . His course was titled Speaking in Tongues : Introductory Linguistics . Stasselova was about sixty-five and a big man , his torso an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architecture of St. Gustav College rose into the cobalt sky . It looked like a rendition of thought itself , rising out of the head in intricate , heartbreaking cornices that became more abstract and complicated as they rose . I was in my third week of college . I loved every moment of it , every footfall . The students resembled the students I 'd known in high school , Scandinavian midwesterners like myself , whose fathers were all pastors or some declension thereof-but the professors thrilled me . Most had come from the East Coast , and seemed fragile and miserable in the Midwest . Occasionally during class you could see hope for us rising in them , and then they would look like great birds flying over an uncertain landscape , asking mysterious questions , trying to lead us somewhere we could not yet go . I wanted to be noticed by them , to distinguish myself from the ordinary mass of students , and to this end I had plagiarized my first paper for Stasselova 's class . This was why , I presumed , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Common Harvest , " was on the desk between us . I had found it in the Kierkegaard Library . It was a chapter in an old green-cloth book that was so small I could palm it . The book had been written in 1945 , by a man named Delores Tretsky , and it had n't been signed out since 1956 . I began to leaf through it , and then crouched down to read . I read for a full hour ; I thought it beautiful . I had not once in all my life stopped for even a moment to consider grammar , to wonder how it rose out of history like a wing unfurling . I had intended to write my own paper , to synthesize , as Stasselova had suggested , my own ideas with the author 's , but I simply had nothing to contribute . It seemed even rude to combine this work with my own pale , unemotional ideas . So I lifted a chapter , only occasionally dimming some passages that were too fine , too blinding . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was holding his coffee cup over it , and I saw that coffee had already spilled on the page to form a small , murky pond . " Thank you , " I said .

" " You seem fully immersed in a study of oppression . Any reason for this ? " " Well , I do live in the world . " " Yes , that 's right . And you say here-a shocking line-that a language must sometimes be repressed , and replaced , for the larger good . You believe this ? " " Yes .

As children we were forced to speak Russian , even in our homes , even when we said good-night to our mothers as we fell asleep . " This was turning into a little piece of bad luck . " When did you write this ? " he asked . " Last week . " " It reads like it was written fifty years ago . It reads like Soviet propaganda . " " Oh , " I said . " I did n't mean it that way .

" " Unfortunately , you ca n't . " " Why not ? " " It 's complicated . " " In what way ? " " Well , she 's stopped eating . She 's very thin . Her parents were worried , so they took her home . " " Where does she live ? " " I do n't know . " We both sat silent . Luckily , I had experience lying in my adolescence , and knew it was possible to win even though both parties were aware of the lie . The exercise was not a search for truth but rather a test of exterior reserve . " I 'm sure she 'll be returning soon , " I said . " I 'll have her call you . " Stasselova smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , his sarcasm curled inside his concern . " Okay , " I said . I got up and hoisted my bag over my shoulder . As I stood , I could see the upper edge of the sun falling down off the hill on which St. Gustav was built . I 'd never seen the sun from this angle before , from above as it fell , as it so obviously lit up another part of the world , perhaps even flaming up the sights of Stasselova 's precious , oppressed Poland , its dark contested forests and burning cities , its dreamy and violent borders . MY roommate Solveig was permanently tan . She went twice a week to a tanning salon and bleached her hair frequently , so that it looked like radioactive foliage growing out of dark , moody sands . Despite all this she was very beautiful , and sensible . " Margaret , " she said when I came in that evening . " The library telephoned to recall a book . They said it was urgent . " I had thought he might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As I rifled through the clothes on my closet floor , I decided it would have to be burned . I would finish the book and then I would burn it . But first there was tonight , and I had that rare thing , a date . My date was from Stasselova 's class . His name was Hans ; he was a junior , and his father was a diplomat . He had almost auburn hair that fell to his neckline . He wore , always , long white shirts whose sleeves were just slightly , almost imperceptibly , puffed at the shoulders , like an elegant little joke , and very long , so they hung over his hands . I thought he was articulate , kind . I had in a moment of astonishment asked him out . The night was soft and warm . We walked through the tiny town , wandered its thin river . We ate burgers . He spoke of Moscow , where he had lived that summer . I had spent my childhood with a vision of Russia in the distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But this was 1987 , the beginning of perestroika , of glasnost , and views of Russia were changing . Television showed a country of rain and difficulty and great humility , and Gorbachev was always bowing to sign something or other , his head bearing a mysterious stain shaped like a continent one could almost but not quite identify . I said to Hans that I wanted to go there myself , though I had never thought of the idea before that moment . He said , " You can if you want . " We were in his small , iridescent apartment by now . " Or perhaps to Poland , " I said , thinking of Stasselova . " Poland , " Hans said . " Yes . What is left of it , after men like Stasselova . " " What do you mean , men like Stasselova ? " " Soviet puppets . " " Yet he is clearly anti-Soviet , " I said . " Now , yes . Everybody is anti-Soviet now . " The sign for the one Japanese restaurant in town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hans 's body into geometric shapes . He took my hand , and at that moment the whole world seemed to have entered his apartment . I found him intelligent , deliberate , large-hearted . " Now , " he said , " is the time to be anti-Soviet . " N Monday afternoon , in class , Hans sat across from me . We were all sitting around a conference table , waiting for Stasselova . Hans smiled . I gave him the peace sign across the table . When I looked back at him , moments later , Hans 's hands were casually laid out on the table , palms down . I saw then , for the first time , that his left hand tapered into only three fingers , which were fused together at the top knuckle . The hand looked delicate , surprising . I had not noticed this on our date , and now I wondered if he had purposely kept me from seeing it , or if I had somehow just missed it . For a brief , confused moment , I even wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hans looked me squarely in the eye . I smiled back . Stasselova then entered the room . In light of my date with Hans , I had almost forgotten my visit with him the previous Friday . I 'd meant to burn the book over the weekend in the darkness at the ravine , though I dreaded this . My mother was a librarian , and I knew that the vision of her daughter burning a book would have been like a sledgehammer to the heart . Throughout the class Stasselova seemed to be speaking directly to me , still chastising me . His eyes kept resting on me disapprovingly . " The reason for the sentence is to express the verb-a change , a desire . But the verb can not stand alone ; it needs to be supported , to be realized by a body , and thus the noun-just as the soul in its trajectory through life needs to be comforted by the body . " The sun 's rays slanted in on Stasselova as he veered into very interesting territory . " All things in revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need protection . For instance , when my country , Poland , was annexed by the Soviet Union , we had the choice of joining what was called Berling 's army , the Polish wing of the Russian army , or the independent Home Army . Many considered it anti-Polish to join the Russian army , but I believed , as did my comrades , that more could be done through the system , within the support of the system , than without . " He looked at me . I nodded . I was one of those students who nod a lot . His eyes were like brown velvet under glass . " This is the power of the sentence , " he said . " It acts out this drama of control and subversion . The noun always stands for what is , the status quo , and the verb for what might be , the ideal . " Across the table Hans 's damaged hand , spindly and nervy , drummed impatiently on the tabletop . I could tell he wanted to speak up . Stasselova turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " Years ago . Right or wrong , I thought it best at the time . I thought we could do more work for the Polish cause from within the Red Army than from outside it . " Hans 's face was impassive . He suddenly looked years older-austere , cold , priestly . Stasselova turned then to look at me . This was obviously an issue for him , I thought , and I nodded as he continued to speak . I really did feel supportive . Whatever army he thought was best at the time , that was fine with me . IN the evening I went to the ravine in the elm forest , which lay curled around the hill on which the campus was built . This forest seemed deeply peaceful to me , almost conscious . I did n't know the reason for this at the time-that many elms in a forest can spring from a single tree . In this case a single elm had divided herself into a forest , an individual with a continuous DNA in whose midst one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an old emotional wound . I crouched on its bank and glanced at the book one last time . I flicked open my lighter . The book caught fire instantly . As the flame approached my hand , I arced the book into the murky water . It looked spectacular , a high wing of flame rising from it . Inside , in one of its luminous chapters , I had read that the ability to use language and the ability to tame fire arose from the same warm , shimmering pool of genes , since in nature they did not appear one without the other . As I made my way out of the woods and into the long silver ditch that lined the highway , I heard about a thousand birds cry , and I craned my neck to see them lighting out from the tips of the elms . They looked like ideas would if released suddenly from the page and given bodies-shocked at how blood actually felt as it ran through the veins , as it sent them wheeling into the west , wings raking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I RETURNED and found Solveig turning in the lamplight . Her hair was piled on her head , so unnaturally blonde it looked ablaze , and her face was bronze . She looked a thousand years old . " Some guy called , " she said . " Stasselova or something . " He called again that night , at nearly midnight . I thought this unseemly . " So , " he said . " Solveig 's back . " " Yes , " I said , glancing at her . She was at her mirror , performing some ablution on her face . " She 's much better . " " Perhaps the three of us can now meet . " " Oh , " I said , " it 's too early . " " Too early in what ? " " In her recovery . " Solveig wheeled her head around to look at me . I smiled , shrugged . " I think she 'll be okay . " " I 'm not so sure . " " Listen , " he said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paper in my office , bringing in whatever materials you need , or the three of us can meet and clear this up . " " Fine , we 'll meet you . " " You know my hours . " " I do . " I hung up and explained to Solveig what had happened-Stasselova 's obsession with language and oppression , my plagiarism , the invocation of her name . Solveig nodded and said of course , whatever she could do she would . WHEN we arrived that Wednesday , the light had almost gone from his office but was still lingering outside the windows , like the light in fairy tales , rich and creepy . Solveig was brilliant . Just her posture , as she sat in the narrow chair , was enough initially to chasten Stasselova . In her presence men were driven to politeness , to sincerity , to a kind of deep , internal apology . He thanked her , bowing a little at his desk . " Your work has interested me , " he said . " It is not my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just discussed together some of the ideas . " " Such as ? " " Well , the necessity of a collective language , a mutual tongue . " " And why is that necessary ? " Stasselova leaned back and folded his hands across his vast torso . " To maintain order , " she said . And then the sun fell completely , blowing one last blast of light across the Americas before it settled into the Soviet Union , and some of that light , a glittery , barely perceptible dust , settled around Solveig 's head . She looked like a dominatrix , an intellectual dominatrix , delivering this brutal news . " And your history in psycholinguistics ? " he said . " I have only my personal history , " she said . " The things that have happened to me . " I would not have been surprised if at that declaration the whole university had imploded , turned to liquid , and flowed away . " Besides , " she said , " all the research and work was Margaret 's . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Then , Margaret , " he turned his gaze on me , " I see you are intimately connected with evolutionary history as well as Soviet ideology . As well , it appears , you 've been steeped in a lifetime 's study of linguistic psychosocial theory . " " Is it because she 's female , " Solveig asked , " that she 's made to account for every scrap of knowledge ? " " Look , " he said after a long , cruel silence , " I simply want to know from what cesspool these ideas arose . If you got them from a book , I will be relieved , but if these ideas are still floating around in your bloodlines , in your wretched little towns , I want to know . " I was about to cave in . Better a plagiarist than a fascist from a tainted bloodline . " I do n't really think you should be talking about our bloodlines , " Solveig said . " It 's probably not appropriate . " She enunciated the word " appropriate " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both he and I stared at her . She really was extraordinarily thin . In a certain light she could look shockingly beautiful , but in another , such as the dim one in Stasselova 's office , she could look rather threatening . Her contact lenses were the color of a night sky split by lightning . Her genetic information was almost entirely hidden-the color of her hair and eyes and skin , the shape of her body-and this gave her a psychological advantage of sorts . STASSELOVA " S lecture on Thursday afternoon was another strange little affair , given as long autumn rays of sun , embroidered by leaves , covered his face and body . He was onto his main obsession again , the verb-specifically , the work of the verb in the sentence , and how it relates to the work of a man in the world . " The revolution takes place from a position of stability , always . The true revolutionary will find his place within the status quo . " " And this is why you joined the Russian army in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startling us all . " I did not attack my own country , " Stasselova said . " Never . " " But you watched as the Nazis attacked it in August of 1944 , yes ? And used that attack for your own purposes ? " " This night I was there , it 's true , " he said , " on the banks of the Vistula , and I saw Warsaw burn . And I was wearing the fur hat of Russia , yes . But when I attempted to cross the Vistula , in order to help those of my countrymen who were escaping , I was brought down-clubbed with a rifle to the back of the head by my commanding officer , a Russian . " " That 's interesting , because in accounts of the time you are referred to as an officer yourself-Officer Stasselova , of course . " " Yes . I was a Polish officer though . Certainly you can infer the hierarchy involved ? " " What I can infer . . . " Hans 's voice rose , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can infer . . , " and for a moment the exchange reminded me of those rounds we sang at summer camp . " What you can infer , " Stasselova said , drowning out Hans , " is that this was an ambiguous time for those of us who were Polish . You ca n't judge after the fact . Perhaps you think that I should be dead on those banks , making the willows to grow . " Stasselova 's eyes were shot with the dying light ; he squinted at us and looked out the window momentarily . " You will stand there and think maybe certain men in certain times should not choose their own lives , should not want to live . " And then he turned away from Hans . I myself scowled at Hans . So rude ! " And so I did live , " Stasselova said finally . " Mostly because I was wearing my Russian hat , made of the fur of ten foxes . It was always Russia that dealt us blows , and it was always Russia that saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was with Hans in the woods . We were on our stomachs in a clearing , looking to the east , from where the rain was stalking us through the trees . " What I want to know , " Hans was saying , " is why is he always asking for you to see him ? " " Oh , " I said , " he thinks I plagiarized that first paper . " " Did you ? " " Not really . " " Why does he think so ? " " Says it smacks of Soviet propaganda . " " Really ? Well , he should know . " " I agree with him-that you 're judging him from an irrelevant stance . " " He was found guilty of treason by his own people , not me-by the Committee for Political Responsibility . Why else would he be here , teaching at some Lutheran college in Minnesota ? This is a guy who brought martial law down on his own people , and now we sit here in the afternoon and watch him march around in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Christ 's sake-to his own innocence . " " Yet all sorts of people were found guilty of all sorts of meaningless things by that committee . " " I bet he thinks you 're a real dream-this woman willing to absolve the old exterminator of his sins . " " That 's insulting , " I said . But I realized how fond I 'd grown of this professor in his little office , drinking his bitter coffee , night descending into the musky heart of Humanities . And then the rain was upon us . We could hear it on the tiny ledges of leaves above us more than feel it . " Let 's go , " Hans said , grabbing my hand with his left , damaged hand . The way his hand held mine was alluring ; his hand had the nimbus of an idea about it , as if the gene that had sprung this hand had a different world in mind , a better world , where hands had more torque when they grasped each other , and people held things differently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lanterns , and were passed on and on . MONDAY was gray , with long silver streaks of rain . I dragged myself out of the warmth of my bed and put on my rain slicker . At nine forty-five I headed toward Stasselova 's office . " Hello , " I said , knocking on the open door . " I 'm sorry to disturb you outside your office hours . " I was shivering ; I felt pathetic . " Margaret , " he said . " Hello . Come in . " As I sat down , he said , " You 've brought with you the smell of rain . " He poured me coffee in a Styrofoam cup . During our last class I had been so moved by his description of that night on the Vistula that I 'd decided to confess . But now I was hesitating . " Could I have some of this cream ? " I asked , pointing to a little tin cup of it on his windowsill . " There it is again , " he said , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ? " " That little verbal tic of yours . " " I did n't know I had one , " I said . " I noticed it first in class , " he said . " You say " this " instead of " that ' ; this cream , " not that cream . " The line people draw between the things they consider this and the things they consider that is the perimeter of their sphere of intimacy . You see ? Everything inside is this ; everything inside is close , is intimate . Since you pointed at the cream and it is farther from you than I am , " this " suggests that I am among the things you consider close to you . I 'm flattered , " he said , and handed me the creamer , which was , like him , sweating . What an idea-that with a few words you could catch another person in a little grammatical clutch , arrange the objects of the world such that they bordered the two of you . " At any rate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . " " You are ? " " Yes . I 've wanted to ask you something . " " Yes ? " " This spring the college will hold its annual symposium on language and politics . I thought you might present your paper . Usually one of the upperclassmen does this , but I thought your paper might be more appropriate . " " I thought you hated my paper . " " I do . " " Oh . " " So you 'll do it ? " " I 'll think about it , " I said . He nodded and smiled , as if the matter were settled . The rain was suddenly coming down very hard . It was loud , and we were silent for a few moments , listening . I stared beyond his head out the window , which was blurry with water , so that the turrets of the campus looked like a hallucination , like some shadow world looming back there in his unconscious . " This rain , " he said then , in a quiet , astonished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was meant to-quietly , with a sharp tip , but then , like an arrowhead , widening and widening , until it included the whole landscape around us . THE rain turned to snow , and winter settled on our campus . The face of nature turned away-beautiful and distracted . After Christmas at home ( where I received my report card , a tiny slip of paper that seemed to have flown across the snows to deliver me my A in Stasselova 's class ) I hunkered down in my dorm for the month of January , and barely emerged . The dorm in which most of us freshman girls lived was the elaborate , dark Agnes Mellby Hall , named after the stern , formidable virgin whose picture hung over the fireplace in our lounge . As winter crept over us , we retired to Mellby earlier and earlier . Every night that winter , in which most of us were nineteen , was a slumber party in the main sitting room among its ornate furnishings , all of which had the paws of beasts where they touched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Romans , but childish foods , popcorn and pizza and ice cream , most of us spiraling downstairs now and then to throw up in the one private bathroom . On one of those nights I was reading a book in the sitting room when I received a phone call from Solveig , who was down at a house party in town and wanted me to come help her home . She was n't completely drunk , but calculated that she would be in about forty-five minutes . Her body was like a tract of nature that she understood perfectly-a constellation whose movement across the night sky she could predict , or a gathering storm , or maybe , more accurately , a sparkling stream of elements into which she introduced alcohol with such careful calibration that her blood flowed exactly as she desired , uphill and down , intersecting precisely , chemically , with time and fertility . Solveig did not stay at the dorm with us much , but rather ran with an older pack of girls , feminists mostly , who that winter happened to be involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the president of the college , who was clearly terrified of them . About ten minutes before I was to leave , Stasselova appeared in the doorway of the sitting room . I had not seen him in more than a month , since the last day of class , but he had called a few times . I had not returned his calls , in the hopes that he would forget about my participation in the symposium . But here he was , wearing a long gray coat over his bulkiness . His head looked huge , the bones widely spaced , like the architecture of a grand civic building . The look in his eyes caused me to gaze out across the room and try to see what he was seeing : perhaps some debauched canvas of absolute female repose , girls lying everywhere in various modes of pajamas and sweats , surrounded by vast quantities of food and books . Some girlsand even I found this a bit creepy-had stuffed animals that they carried with them to the sitting room at night . I happened to be poised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a book spread in front of me , but almost all the rest were lying on their backs with their extremities cast about , feet propped on the couch or stretched up in the air at weird , hyperextended angles . We were Lutherans , after all , and unlike the more experienced , secular girls across the river , at the state college , we were losing our innocence right here , among ourselves . It was being taken from us physically , and we were just relaxing until it fell away completely . Stasselova , in spite of all he 'd seen in his life , which I 'd gleaned from what he said in class ( the corpulent Goering marching through the forest , marking off Nazi territory , and later Stalin 's horses breaking through the same woods , heralding the swath that would now be Soviet ) , still managed to look a little scared as he peered into our sitting room , eventually lifting a hand to wave at me . I got up and approached him . " Hey , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's good to see you . Thanks for the A. " " You deserved it . Listen , I have something for you , " he said , mildly gesturing for us to leave the doorway , because everybody was looking at us . " Great , " I said . " But you know , right now I need to walk downtown to pick up Solveig at a house party . " " Fine , " he said . " I 'll walk you . " " Oh . Okay . " I got my jacket , and the two of us stepped into the night . The snow had arranged itself in curling waves on the Mellby lawn , and stuck in it were hundreds of silver forks , which , in a flood of early-evening testosterone , the freshman boys had placed in the earth , a gesture appropriate to their sexual frustration and also to their faith in the future . Stasselova and I stepped between them . They looked spooky and lovely , like tiny silver grave sites in the snow . As we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pocket and handed it to me . On the front it said , in emerald-green letters , " 9th Annual Symposium on Language and Politics . " Inside , under " Keynote Student Speaker , " was my name . " Margaret Olafson , The Common Harvest . " " I stopped walking . We paused at the top of the stairs that floated down off the campus and into the town . I felt extremely , inordinately proud . Some winter lightning , a couple of great wings of it , flashed in the north . Stasselova looked paternal , grand . THE air at the party was beery and wildish , and the house itself-its many random rooms and slanting floors-seemed the product of a drunken adolescent mind . At first we could not spot Solveig , so Stasselova and I waited quietly in the hallway until a guy in a baseball cap came lurching toward us , shouting in a friendly way over the music that we could buy plastic glasses for the keg for two dollars apiece . Stasselova paid him and then threaded through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand in the keg line . I watched him as he patiently stood there , the snowflakes melting on his dark shoulders . And then Hans was on my arm . " What on earth ? " he said . " Why are you here ? I thought you hated these parties . " He 'd been dancing , apparently . He was soaked in sweat , his hair curling up at his neck . I pointed to Stasselova . " No kidding , " Hans said . " He showed up at my dorm as I was leaving to get Solveig . " " He came to Mellby ? " " Yes . " " God , look at him . I bet they had a nickname for him , like the Circus Man or something . All those old fascists had cheery nicknames . " Stasselova was now walking toward us . Behind him the picture window revealed a nearly black sky , with pretty crystalline stars around . He looked like a dream one might have in childhood . " He is not a fascist , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass . " Hans , yes , how are you ? This is a wonderful party , " Stasselova said , and it actually was . Sometimes these parties could seem deeply cozy , their wildness and noise an affirmation against the formless white midwestern winter surrounding us . He handed me a beer . " So , " he said rather formally , lifting his glass . " To youth . " " To experience , " Hans said , smiling , and lifted his glass . " To the party . " Stasselova looked pleased , his eyes shining from the soft lamplight . " The Party ? " Hans raised an eyebrow . " This party , " Stasselova said forcefully , cheerfully . " And to the committee , " Hans said . " The committee ? " " The Committee for Political Responsibility . " In one of Stasselova 's lectures he had taken great pains to explain to us that language did not describe events , it handled them , as a hand handles an object , and that in this way language made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hans had taken this to heart and was making lurching attempts in this direction . Mercifully , Solveig appeared . Her drunkenness and her dignity had synergized into something quite spectacular , an inner recklessness accompanied by great external restraint . Her hair looked the color of heat-bright white . She was wearing newly cut-off jeans and was absently holding the disassociated pant legs in her hand . " The professor , " she said , when she saw Stasselova . " The professor of oppression . " " Hello , Solveig . " " So you came , " she said , as if this had been the plan all along . " Yes . It 's nice to see you again . " " You as well , " she said . " Why are you here ? " The whole scene looked deeply romantic to me . " To take you home , " he said . " Home ? " she said , as if this were the most elegant and promising word in the language . " Yours or mine ? " " Yours , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is your home again ? " she asked . Her eyes were glimmering with complexity , like something that is given to human beings after evolution , as a gift . " I live downtown , " he said . " No , your real home . Your homeland . " He paused . " I am from Poland , " he said finally . " Then there . Let 's go there . I have always wanted to go to Poland . " Stasselova smiled . " Perhaps you would like it there . " " I have always wanted to see Wenceslaus Square . " " Well , that is nearby . " " Excellent . Let us go . " And Solveig swung open the front door and walked into the snow in her shorts and T-shirt . I kissed Hans good-bye , and Stasselova and I followed her . Once outside , Stasselova took off his coat and hung it around Solveig . Underneath his coat he was wearing a dark jacket and a tie . It looked sweet , and made me think that if one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found underneath . Solveig was walking before us on the narrow sidewalk . Above her , on the hill , hovered Humanities-great , intelligent , alight . She reached into the coat pocket and pulled out , to my astonishment , a fur hat . The hat ! The wind lifted , and the trees shook off a little of their silver snow . Humanities leaned over us , interested in its loving but secular way . I felt as sure about everything as those archaeologists who discover a single bone and can then hypothesize the entire animal . Solveig placed the hat on her head and turned to vamp for a moment , opening and closing the coat and raising her arms above her head in an exaggerated gesture of beauty . She looked like some stirring , turning simulacrum of communist and capitalist ideas . As she was doing this , we passed by the president 's house . It was an old-fashioned house , with high turrets , and had a bizarre modern wing hanging off one end of it . Solveig studied it for a moment as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , " Motherfucker ! " Stasselova looked as if he 'd been clubbed again in the back of the head , but he kept walking . He pretended that nothing had happened , did n't even turn his head to look at the house , but when I turned to him , I saw his eyes widen and his face stiffen with shock . I said " Oh " quietly , and grabbed his hand for a moment to comfort him , to let him know that everything was under control , that this was Minnesota . Look-the president 's house is still as dark as death , the moon is still high , the snow sparkling everywhere . His hand was extraordinarily big . After Hans 's hand , which I 'd held for the past few months , Stasselova 's more ordinary hand felt strange , almost mutant , its five fingers splayed and independent . THE next night , in the cafeteria , over a grisly neon dish called Festival Rice , I told Hans about the hat . " I saw the hat , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shouted , in what was a St. Gustav tradition , " I want a standing ovation ! " The entire room stood and erupted into wild applause and hooting . Hans and I stood as well , and as we clapped , I leaned over to yell , " He 's been telling the truth about that night overlooking Warsaw : I saw the hat he was wearing . " " What does that mean ? That means nothing . I have a fur hat . " " No , " I said . " It was this big Russian hat . You should have seen it . This big , beautiful Russian hat . Solveig put it on . It saved his life . " Hans did n't even try to object ; he just kind of gasped , as if the great gears of logic in his brain could not pass this syllogism through . We were still standing , clapping , applauding . I could n't help thinking of something Stasselova had said in class : that at rallies for Stalin , when he spoke to crowds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first to stop clapping . I AVOIDED my paper for the next month or so , until spring crashed in huge warm waves and I finally sought it out , sunk in its darkened drawer . It was a horrible surprise . I was not any more of a scholar , of course , than I had been six months earlier , when I 'd plagiarized it , but my eyes had now passed over Marx and a biography of Stalin ( microphones lodged in eyeglasses , streams of censors on their way to work , bloody corpses radiating out of Moscow ) and the gentle Bonhoeffer . Almost miraculously I had crossed that invisible line beyond which people turn into actual readers , when they start to hear the voice of the writer as clearly as in a conversation . " Language , " Tretsky had written , " is essentially a coercive act , and in the case of Eastern Europe it must be used as a tool to garden collective hopes and aspirations . " As I read , with Solveig napping at the other end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with his suggestions of annexations and , worse , of solutions , seemed to be reaching right off the page , his long , thin hand grasping me by the shirt . And I could almost hear the wild mazurka , as Stasselova had described it , fading , the cabarets closing down , the music turning into a chant , the bootheels falling , the language fortifying itself , becoming a stronghold-a fixed , unchanging system , as the paper said , a moral framework . ALMOST immediately I was on my way to Stasselova 's office , but not before my mother called . The golden brochures had gone out in the mail . " Sweetie ! " she said . " What 's this ? Keynote speaker ? Your father and I are beside ourselves . Good night ! " She always exclaimed " Good night ! " at times of great happiness . I could not dissuade her from coming , and as I fled the dorm , into the rare , hybrid air of early April , I was wishing for those bad , indifferent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives . The earth under my feet as I went to him was very sticky , almost lugubrious , like the earth one sometimes encounters in dreams . Stasselova was there , as always . He seemed pleased to see me . I sat down and said , " You know , I was thinking that maybe somebody else could take my place at the symposium . As I reread my paper , I realized it is n't really what I meant to say at all . " " Oh , " he said . " Of course you can deliver it . I would not abandon you at a moment like this . " " Really , I would n't take it as abandonment . " " I would not leave you in the lurch , " he said . " I promise . " I felt myself being carried , mysteriously , into the doomed symposium , despite my resolve on the way over to back out at all costs . How could I win an argument against somebody with an early training in propaganda ? I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the great sea of persuasion . " See , I did n't really write the paper myself . " " Well , every thinker builds an idea on the backs of those before him-or her , in your case . " He smiled at this . His teeth were very square , and humble , with small gaps between them . I could see that Stasselova was no longer after a confession . I was more valuable if I contained these ideas . Probably he 'd been subconsciously looking for me ever since he 'd lain on the muddy banks of the Vistula , Warsaw flaming across the waters . He could see within me all his failed ideals , the ugliness of his former beliefs contained in a benign vessel-a girl ! - high on a religious hill in the Midwest . He had found somebody he might oppose , and in this way absolve himself . He smiled . I could feel myself as indispensable in the organization of his psyche . Behind his head , in the sunset , the sun was n't falling , only receding farther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the days before a wedding one dreads , both endless and accelerated , the sky filling with springtime events-ravishing sun , great winds , and eccentric green storms that focused everyone 's attention skyward . And then the weekend of the symposium was upon us , the Saturday of my speech rising in the east . I awoke early and went to practice my paper on the red steps of Humanities , in whose auditorium my talk was to take place . Solveig was still sleeping , hung over from the night before . I 'd been with her for the first part of it , had watched her pursue a man she 'd discovered-a graduate student , actually , in town for the symposium . I had thought him a bit of a bore , but I trusted Solveig 's judgment . She approached men with stealth and insight , her vision driving into those truer , more isolated stretches of personality . I had practiced the paper countless times , and revised it , attempting to excise the most offensive lines without gutting the paper entirely and thus disappointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line " If we could agree on a common language , a single human tongue , perhaps then a single flag might unfurl over the excellent earth , one nation of like and companion souls . " Reading it now , I had a faint memory of my earlier enthusiasm for this paper , its surface promise , its murderous innocence . Remembering this , I looked out over the excellent earth , at the town below the hill . And there , as always , was a tiny Gothic graveyard looking peaceful , everything still and settled finally under the gnarled , knotty , nearly human arms of apple trees . There were no apples yet , of course : they were making their way down the bough , still liquid , or whatever they are before birth . At the sight of graves I could n't help thinking of Tretsky , my ghost-writer , in his dark suit under the earth , delightedly preparing , thanks to me , for his one last gasp . By noon the auditorium had filled with a crowd of about two hundred , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with Hans and Solveig , who sat together , and , two rows behind them , my long-suffering parents , flushed with pride . I sat alone on a slight stage at the front of the room , staring out at the auditorium , which was named Luther . It had wooden walls and was extremely tall ; it seemed humble and a little awkward , in that way the tall can seem . The windows stretched its full height , so that one could see the swell of earth on which Humanities was built , and then , above , all manner of weather , which this afternoon was running to rain . In front of these windows stood the reformed genius of martial law himself , the master of ceremonies , Stasselova . Behind him were maple trees , with small green leaves waving . He had always insisted in class that language as it rises in the mind looks like a tree branching , from finity to infinity . Let every voice cry out ! He had once said this , kind of absently , and water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising of the body 's water into the line of sight . After he introduced me , I stood in front of the crowd , my larynx rising quite against my will , and delivered my paper . I tried to speak each word as a discrete item , in order to persuade the audience not to synthesize the sentences into meaning . But when I lifted my head to look out at my listeners , I could see they were doing just that . When I got to the part where I said the individual did not exist-citizens were " merely shafts of light lost , redemptively , in the greater light of the state " -I saw Hans bow his head and rake his otherworldly hand through his hair . " . . . And if force is required to forge a singular and mutual grammar . then it is our sacred duty to hasten the birthpangs . " Even from this distance I could hear Stasselova 's breathing , and the sound of blood running through him like a quiet but rushing stream . And then my parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " force , " " flowering , " " blood " I could see that the very elegant parental machinery they had designed over the years , which sought always to translate my deeds into something lovely , light-bearing , full of promise , was spinning a little on its wheels . Only Solveig , that apparatchik of friendship , maintained her confidence in me . Even when she was hung over , her posture suggested a perfect alignment between heaven and earth . She kept nodding , encouraging me . I waited the entire speech for Stasselova to leap forward and confront me , to reassert his innocence in opposition to me , but he did not , even when I reached the end . He stood and watched as everybody clapped in bewilderment , and a flushed floral insignia rose on his cheeks . I had come to love his wide , excited face , the old circus man . He smiled at me . He was my teacher , and he had wrapped himself , his elaborate historical self , into this package , and stood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little lesson , which turned out to be not about Poland or fascism or war , borderlines or passion or loyalty , but just about the sentence : the importance of , the sweetness of . And I did long for it , to say one true sentence of my own , to leap into the subject , that sturdy vessel traveling upstream through the axonal predicate into what is possible ; into the object , which is all possibility ; into what little we know of the future , of eternity-the light of which , incidentally , was streaming in on us just then through the high windows . Above Stasselova 's head the storm clouds were dispersing , as if frightened by some impending good will , and I could see that the birds were out again , forming into that familiar pointy hieroglyph , as they 're told to do from deep within .
