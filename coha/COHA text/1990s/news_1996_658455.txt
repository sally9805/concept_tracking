<p> As the red-brick clock tower on Queen Street strikes 8 , hundreds of eager visitors file into three theaters in tiny Niagara-on-the-Lake , Ontario . The Shaw Festival , now in its 35th year , serves up plays , musicals , and mysteries 40 times each week from April through October , celebrating the life , times , and legacies of George Bernard Shaw . <p> " We call them plays about the beginning of the modern world , " explains festival artistic director Christopher Newton , who heads the venerable Canadian institution . Their mandate , he says , is to present the plays of Shaw ( a total of 52 ) and those who wrote during his lifetime ( 1856-1950 ) , encompassing " all the great plays of the modern world . " He explains : " During that period , ideas took over from sensations . " <p> Because the festival operates on a repertory system , with 11 plays operating on a rotating basis throughout its six-month season , visitors can see all the productions in a week . <p> This season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disciple " and " The Simpleton of the Unexpected Isles , " as well as Oscar Wilde 's " An Ideal Husband , " the 1930s musical " Mr. Cinders , " J.M. Barrie 's " Shall We Join the Ladies ? , " and Agatha Christie 's " The Hollow , " all featuring Canada 's top actors , designers , and directors . <p> Major productions , such as " Disciple " as well as " Hobson 's Choice " and " Rashomon , " are presented in the Festival Theatre , a sleek , modern structure with 861 seats , banked by outdoor garden , flagstone terrace , and lily pond . <p> Musicals and mysteries find their home at the Royal George Theatre , a turn-of-the-century , 328-seat house reminiscent of a more traditional era . Experimental , smaller , and more esoteric selections such as " Simpleton " and J.M. Synge 's " The Playboy of the Western World " play at the Court House Theatre , its 328 seats set up each May within the confines of the town 's courthouse banquet hall . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the venues for 733 performances . All three are located within blocks of one another , along the provincial town 's beautifully manicured streets . <p> Stylistic spectrum <p> Each production remains true to its origins . " The Devil 's Disciple " rings with its towering message of hypocrisy amid imposing wooden bastions from the 18th-century colonial wars of North America , capturing the isolation , irony , and greed Shaw laced throughout the text . <p> On the opposite end of the stylistic spectrum is " Rashomon , " written by Fay and Michael Kanin , based on the stories of Ryunosuke Akutagawa that inspired the acclaimed Akira Kurosawa film about feudal Japan 1,000 years ago . The powerful production pulls audiences into the surreal world of the imagined myth , combining original haunting music with a set that includes miles of red silk and a perilous hillside to weave its ambiguously lurid tale . <p> Bouncy production numbers , vivid costume , and wildly exaggerated acting heighten the fun of " Mr. Cinders , " a role-reversing satire of the Cinderella fairy tale . The play is set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rackets as dance props . <p> And dinner jackets , teacups , and French doors abound in " The Hollow . " The suspense is heightened by the design choice to present the Christie mystery in a black-and-white motif , accented sparingly with flashes of bold red . <p> All this theatrical activity , unique in its scope , has proven popular with audiences . Their support is evidenced by the festival 's income breakdown : 72 percent of the festival 's operating budget comes from ticket sales , with an average price of $ 31 . And with another 19 percent contributed by corporate and private-sector sponsorship , only 9 percent is derived from government funding . <p> Its proximity to Niagara Falls , a 20-minute ride away , channels visitors to the festival by thousands , with roughly two-thirds coming from Canada , another one-third from the United States , and 1 percent from other countries . At the height of the season , nearly 500 people operate the theaters , box offices , gift shops , reading series , seminars , and other programs that support the operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Theatre Calgary and moved on to serve as the director of the Vancouver Playhouse before assuming the helm at the Shaw in 1979 , has expanded and deepened the artistic offerings since his tenure began . <p> Under his leadership , the Royal George was added to the festival 's property list ; an extensive series of readings , lunchtime plays , and seminars has been developed ; and the regular menu of mysteries and musicals joined the dramatic offerings . <p> " It 's only within the last decade that we 've been doing the musicals and mysteries , and it came to a head when we did Frank Wedekind 's ' Lula ' at the Festival Theatre . We managed to get a lot of people who thought it was some kind of French farce , expecting plenty of laughs , and when it ends with the Countess being skewed by Jack the Ripper at the end , we had them running from the theater ! " <p> Newton concluded that a separate house dedicated to thrillers , mysteries , and musicals would " stream the audience more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . " We had been doing only musicals there , eight times a week , and the company was feeling isolated from the rest of the festival , so we wanted to add something equally ' popular . ' It occurred to me that not only was the musical invented during Shaw 's lifetime , but the murder-mystery was also . " <p> Along with Christie , fans of the whodunit genre can follow the clues each season in works by Emlyn Williams , Anthony Armstrong , and Dorothy Sayers . <p> Feather in actors ' cap <p> For actors , being selected to work a season at the Shaw Festival represents significant prestige . Now in his fourth season , Gordon Rand , who alternates between leads in " The Devil 's Disciple " and " The Playboy of the Western World , " finds it " nothing but rewarding , because I 'm sharing the stage with great actors who help me look good . " <p> Following a year as an apprentice , he gradually rose to larger and larger parts . The contrast between his two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

It allows you to get better and better . " <p> " I did n't have time to be nervous , " confesses apprentice Kenneth Delaney , an understudy tapped to go on when a principal actor fell ill in the " Disciple " company . " I had to go to a costume fitting , be sure that I could work with all the props , get the blocking straight , and rearrange the transitions , all in four hours . There was no time for nerves . And I 'm not sure I really remember what happened , " he grins . <p> Serving as understudy for 10 different roles , along with assignments " as a ' spear-carrier ' in two plays " leaves him little free time .

" Everyone takes care of everyone else . You 're treated as an equal , whether or not you 're in the union , a lead player , or an apprentice . It 's really nurturing . " <p> While the festival 's mandate period ends at mid-century , the surrounding region offers visitors recreational activities decidedly modern-day . <p> Tourists can choose from a variety of tour operators to glide over the pastoral Lake Ontario landscape in small planes , hover above Niagara Falls in choppers , or shoot the rapids on the Niagara River in speedy jet boats . Many tours welcome families with children and offer a different perspective on the stunning scenic district . <p> Local inns and hotels also insure that visitors experience the full range of possibilities . One of the most celebrated , the newly restored full-service Pillar and Post Inn , enhances its well-deserved reputation for attention to detail by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays . <p> Newton now revels in the relationship between the festival and the region 's other attractions , commenting on the various mutual programs in place between his organization and the fine restaurants , hotels , inns , wineries , and recreational activities . <p> " It did n't used to be terrific , because they did n't understand what we were , " he admits . " But now , we 're regarded as the little jewel in the crown for Niagara. "
