ON HER SEVENTY-SEVENTH BIRTHDAY , Rose 's husband for fifty-nine years , Major Riggs Glover , who had n't done much for the last two decades but take long walks when the weather was good and carve pieces of wood into angels and statues of his favorite presidents  --  George Washington and Ronald Reagan  --  surprised her terribly by beginning , much more gently and suddenly than she had ever expected , to die across from her at a table in her favorite restaurant . Her immediate response was : How dare you , Riggs Glover ! Not on my birthday . It was just like him to crush her heart in a season of joy , when she felt like coddling and nesting on the little things in life that brought her pleasure . He could be so tragic , casting shadows in her sunshine as when , almost fifty years ago , she received on Easter day a hand-delivered telegram from a colored soldier , anxious and embarrassed by the bad news he bore , informing her that her husband , Lieutenant L. R. Riggs Glover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region of the world whose name was terrible , foreign and communist-sounding to her , impossible even to pronounce as she felt her heart turn to the soft , muddy place where her husband 's grave would dig itself even on Easter , when everybody in Springfield , Tennessee , nodded at each other in the blue morning wash of sun to say , Hallelujah , Christ has risen ! For weeks , women friends brought her the sad cakes they had baked and drove her to church , where the congregation began to treat her , as a new widow , with an unpleasant and distant respect because her quiet pain scared so many women whose husbands were also in Korea . And sometimes , to her shame , she did wish it : she wished all their husbands dead if only she could have Riggs back . Seven weeks later , they found him naked in the communist wilderness , eating roots , insects , worms , and the meat of whatever he could kill . So they brought him back to Springfield , skinny and nearly mute with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Rose 's bed , sometimes screaming out of dark dreams because of all the soul-scars that killing other men had given him , and she cared for him , woke him and turned on the bedside lamp  --  because the dark scared him now  --  and whispered love into his blank face even though she had not always been the kind of woman who could comfort the weakness in men . Instead , as an attractive young woman , she had been demanding of her admirers , feeling in herself only a limited amount of mother-love  --  that indiscriminate , swollen affection for frail things . She had met Riggs at eighteen , attracted by his uniform , his boastfulness , and the way he seemed to dedicate all his masculine power to the respect of women ... to her as a woman . He was a pilot , and she imagined him in his element  --  the purity of air  --  while she , Rose Waters , knew only the long brown busted-open fields of Tennessee  --  the dirty earth where her life had happened . He called her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was clean , literary , flattering to her . " I could only ever love a woman whose name was a flower name , whose name was yours , Rose , " he told her . Not that she did n't make him struggle . Poor Riggs struggled , pleaded six months for the final gift of her virginity , a gift that Pleasant Grove Baptist Church had taught her to give only in matrimony , forcing him to say , " With us , Rose , it will be holy , I promise . How could such a love ever soil us ? " Of course she was a virgin , at least sort of , there being only one other small incident , which she chose to forget now that she was seventy-seven and Riggs had left her . For an old woman had rights against her own history , Rose thought . So yes , she was a virgin until one afternoon the way he sectioned an orange at Plower 's field  --  something about his delicious fingers gently dividing the fruit from its tight , greedy bundle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her open mouth  --  tempted her and they rolled away from their picnic , Riggs wriggling and slipping off her , stupid as a dying fish , wearing , even in the blush of their first sex together , his air force beret , his hat , because Riggs could do nothing in the world , even this , without a hat on his head . Then she knew , by the way he quickly spilt his small mess of pleasure outside her , that he was the true virgin . Poor Riggs . Afterward he apologized , though he could barely speak , and she saw for the first time something small and perishable in his eyes  --  something frightened of the world 's harsh light  --  that taught her that she , a woman , had at least enough mother-love for her sad pretender , a large man , an air force pilot , with something tiny and terrified inside him , whom Rose Waters married at eighteen . Then , as soon as the children came , they died . The first one turned to sadness and spilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it was her heart that had burst out from between her legs and exited forever . The next two lived just long enough to be named , their small lives exploding quietly in the night , silencing the names that Rose would , in her latest years , choose to forget because an old woman alone in the world should be allowed to spare herself a certain amount of pain . Next the war came and went , and perhaps it was better not to have children now that she had her husband to care for . But his nightmares too passed , because time smothers things slowly  --  everything  --  and they bought a store in the Springfield town square and called it Glovers , and though they would never be rich , they would always have enough , which Rose 's women friends with children told her to be grateful for . And Rose was grateful . During all this , time did not exactly pass but stood still and expanded , allowing more and more small , unimportant things to happen and fill the widening spaces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began to carve  --  at first ducks and geese and other North American fowl , then his favorite American presidents , and finally , as he worked less and less at the store and politics no longer mattered to him , angels of all sorts  --  fat Italian cherubs as well as powerful-looking adult angels , angels of revelation and retribution . He set his chestnut and oak figures everywhere around their little house , as if for protection . So carving became his art and Riggs became an artist and Rose never pried into this quietest part of her husband , never asked , " Why angels , Riggs ? Are you afraid of something ? " though she knew that he and she and everyone was . She volunteered at the school board and spent time with her friends in the afternoons and once even taught English , evenings , at the Latino Cultural Center in Nashville , driving the forty miles into the city in their boatlike Pontiac . She always felt like there were things to do  --  little adventures of charity and grace . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the spring bloomed outside to people too sick and immobilized to see for themselves . And as time expanded , Riggs 's and her love grew small and constant . The endearments they called each other became names of favorite foods . She called him " sweetcakes " and " dumplings " and he called her " my apple , " which she much preferred to " my flower " because what man called his wife " my apple " save for her Riggs ? So time had made him more original in his love . And then finally all of Rose 's history , all of her life in Springfield , as well as in the other small towns where Riggs 's short air force career had taken them , seemed to arrive at the beginning of her seventy-eighth year , when Riggs surprised her and gave her her last great pain by dying on her birthday , for which Fae Marney , her best friend for fifty-five years , came all the way from Knoxville , and Rose 's two living brothers , Burton and William Waters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kin  --  his sisters , Margaret and Ethel , and their husbands  --  drove long distances just to celebrate and share in her joy , God bless them . Altogether , they made a motorcade of four large cars driving to Mow 's , her and Riggs 's favorite catfish and fried-chicken restaurant . And there , in the orange evening sun of late spring that shone through the windows and made Riggs 's wrinkled face appear molten and oddly soft , he insisted on wearing his fishing cap crowned with the dark barbs of hooks and complained of feeling unwell before he could even take a bite of his favorite slaw , made with vinaigrette instead of mayonnaise dressing , just the way he liked it , when his right hand  --  the one holding the fork  --  fell into the large helping of mashed potatoes and gravy on his plate and he said , " Oh God , Rose . My hand ... my hand . " Not only the hand he ate with , but also the hand her poor pretender , her poor Riggs , carved his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his last moments , afraid , clumsy and virginal again , as on the day he made a mess of their first love together , before the stroke rose up and destroyed the little bit of water that was the rest of his soul on earth and knocked him to the floor of Mow 's , leaving Rose , at the beginning of her newest and oldest year , to be nobody 's apple .
