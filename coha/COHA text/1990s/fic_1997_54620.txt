The last cold front of the season came through in March . As the sun became warmer and the days longer , Gin felt the restlessness that came with spring . It was not the same restlessness she felt in the short , damp days of winter , the kind that brought a sadness as she looked out the window at the bare trees and pale sky , the kind that made her impatient while dressing Lucy in layers of heavy sweaters for school . During the winter , she imagined herself as a bird with broken wings who could not fly when that inexplicable and instinctual thing inside told it to go south . To just go . It was last winter when the restlessness became unbearable . The slightest reminder of warmth-a picture of a hammock in a catalog , the fruit section at the grocery store , the sourness from the paper mill that tinted the rain , the morning light that cast an orange glow upon her skin-had sent Gin into intense longing for the clear turquoise water of the Bahamas and the sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Gin had decided to buy the tug . The boat became a necessity , the thing that would numb the twinges of regret that welled up from her stomach and left a bitter taste in her mouth when she looked at her daughter 's dark-green eyes and could see nothing but Max . The boat would take her closer to that life , bring her back to the careless ease of cruising . <p> The tug was thirty-eight feet long . It had belonged to an old , weather-beaten couple who sadly acknowledged that their age kept them from enjoying the boat as much as they would have liked . Gin took their word that it was seaworthy and relied on her own feeling that the boat was strong . Gin had been on boats that were n't strong ; her gut told her so the second she stepped on their decks . But this tug gave her a good feeling . When she stepped onto it , it bowed slightly to balance itself . She slid her hand along the teak rail . It was smooth and well-oiled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat of red paint . The shallow keel would be good in the Bahamas , the strong cabin secure in storms . <p> " We 've had her for over ten years now , " the old man had said , his arm gently around his wife 's waist . " But we are grandparents and have chosen to act like it before the grandchildren are no longer children . " <p> " And my arthritis does n't allow me to move around as easily as I used to , " the woman added , rubbing her hip . <p> As Gin started to sign the bill of sale , she hesitated , pen in hand , and said , " I 'll take good care of your boat . I promise . " <p> " Once you sign that , dear , " the old woman said , " she will be your boat . " <p> Gin knew it would be difficult to save enough money and courage to leave at Lucy 's summer break , but the knowledge that she someday could go relieved the restlessness and sadness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes watch her hand as she signed . <p> In spring Gin 's restlessness was the kind that comes from a pursuit . There was something good coming , she could feel it . It was in the streets suddenly crowded with tourists , in the long , low notes from a saxophone in the market , notes that squeezed around the people , mingled with the sounds of Dixieland jazz and the motors of a hundred cars looking for a place to park and the whine of the crickets that no one could see but everyone could hear . It was the easy restlessness of a flower needing to bloom , gently pushing its sweet scent into the warm , salty air to mix with the scent of every other flower with the same urge . <p> One bright Sunday , Gin and Lucy rode the tandem bicycle through the less crowded streets of Charleston to the farmer 's market . Gin tried to take a different route every Sunday to give Lucy a chance to pick out her favorite houses . As they approached Colonial Lake , Gin felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go around the lake , Mom , " she said . <p> Gin carefully turned the handlebars ; they were stiff and a bit shaky . The bicycle , which had remained in perfect condition in the suburbs , had rusted after two months of salt air in the marina . As Gin was about to turn the first corner of the lake , Lucy said , " Stop . " <p> Gin pressed her heel against the brakes , and the bike slowed with a moan . She dropped her feet to the pavement , dragging them for a few inches until the bike stopped . Lucy kept her feet on the pedals , poised and ready to go . To their left was the Baker House , built with bricks the color of dried blood and topped with a dulled copper roof . <p> Lucy looked at it , contemplative , and asked , " What are those statues called , the ones that look like dogs with wings ? " <p> " Gargoyles ? " <p> " Yes , " Lucy said . " Gargoyles . That building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you like it now , without gargoyles ? " <p> Lucy tilted her head and bit her lower lip , then said , " No , but I would like it with them . " <p> Gin pointed at the house in front of them . " Do you like that one , Lucy ? " <p> It was a two-story white house with a wrought-iron gate around the front courtyard . There were several black mailboxes by the front door , giving away the shameful secret that it had been converted into apartments . <p> " No , " she said . <p> " Why not ? " <p> " There 's nothing different about it , " Lucy said . <p> Gin smiled . This was why she liked her daughter . <p> On the corner opposite the white house stood a high stone wall . A large hedge with yellow buds held a tight grip on the wall 's top edge , as if without that grip the shrubs would sink into their roots . Only half of the top story was visible from where Gin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and cracks spread out into the stucco like veins . This was the kind of house that neighborhood children ran past on their way home from school , scaring each other and themselves with fantasies of the old woman who lived there , who they heard once tried to kill a kid who climbed the wall to check the yard for bones , to see if she really did eat cats . By the gate to the house was a blue plastic box with newspapers hanging over the sides . <p> " And they recycle , " Lucy said . <p> Lucy had made Gin feel strong from the moment she knew she was pregnant . She and Max were in Nassau . It was easy to lose track of time when they were in port with nothing to do but have sex and sleep late and drink at the Poop Deck with the other sailors . But when her hangovers began lasting well into the afternoon , and sometimes without her having even one drink the night before , she thought something was wrong . When her cigarettes did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Max sat on the bow , a cup of coffee between his hands . He liked to sit there and look down the sides of the hull . The smooth dip in the lines appealed to him . They were clean . <p> Gin stood on the berth and lifted the top half of her body out of the hatch . " Do we have a calendar , Max ? " <p> " I do n't think so , chicken . Why ? " he asked . <p> " Well , is it March yet ? " <p> " It has been for about two weeks , " he said . " Why ? " <p> " We 've been here for about a month now , huh ? " <p> Max put his coffee down . " Are you ready to leave ? " <p> " No , " Gin said . " I was just wondering . " <p> She lowered herself into the cabin and went to the head , where she slid open the cabinet doors and pushed aside the eternally damp towels and washcloths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry in plastic bags , and found the unopened box of Playtex she had bought at 7-Eleven before they left Ft . Lauderdale . Under the sink she found another unopened box among the bottles of aspirin and sunblock . Gin went to the navigation station and found the travel log . Flipping the pages backward , tracing their course to Nassau from Freeport from Bimini , she stopped at the entry marked January 6-the day they left Ft . Lauderdale . <p> Gin returned to the head and took her diaphragm from the shelf above the sink . She removed the drinking cup from the center of the toothbrush holder and replaced it with the diaphragm ; the small rubber dome hung through the cup holder like a breast . She poured water into the diaphragm , then placed the empty cup on the sink directly below it . <p> Max was lying on the bow when she stepped off the boat . <p> " El pollo ! " He said this in the tone he 'd use to greet a friend seen unexpectedly , for the first time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " To the Poop Deck , " she said , hoping her voice sounded as casual and even as she tried to make it . <p> " Well , I guess it 's noon somewhere , " Max said and sat up . " Let me get my shoes . I 'll come with you . " <p> " No . You should sit in the sun . You 're looking pale these days , " she lied . Max 's skin held a deep copper color through the year . " I 'll see you in a bit . " Gin turned , then stopped . " I would n't go below for a while , " she said . " I stunk up the head pretty bad . " She felt a flush of embarrassment and walked quickly off the docks . <p> Gin sat alone at the bar and ordered a vodka tonic . She knew that at that moment her diaphragm was slowly dripping water into the cup , knew this would be her last drink for many months . As she lit her last cigarette , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back to the States and do this . <p> She sensed somehow that she would be all right . The life inside her belly filled her spirit . She had two hearts , two brains , four eyes-she was suddenly twice as good as before . There was no need to talk to Max . He would want her to have an abortion . He had told her all she needed to know last year in Puerto Rico . <p> At the beginning and well into their relationship , Gin tried to name the thing about Max that attracted her to him . If she knew , it was buried within her . She could feel it like a film on her skin , but could never find the right word to convey the sentiment . When they drank , they clung to each other . They felt as if the world became dependent on them . The lights and the music and the sound of the wind existed only in the way they touched and looked at each other . If the music grew louder , the wind stronger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper into each other . <p> But without alcohol , Gin and Max were as familiar to each other as siblings . They did not flirt or grope but walked several feet apart ... solitary . Like magnets of the same polarity , they had to be pushed together to touch , and they repelled when the hand that held them released its grip . <p> Gin had tried before to live without him , unsuccessfully . She knew he would not stop her from leaving now . " If that 's what you want to do , " he would say as he said before , " then it is what you have to do . " So she tapped out the cigarette , left five dollars on the bar , and went back to the boat to get her passport . <p> From far above , the colorful square of awnings in Marion Park would have looked like a game board , and all the people like animated game pieces tossed into the center . Underneath the awnings was another parade of color : from the deep , bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the greens of watermelons , asparagus , limes , string beans , dotted with yellow and red onions , red-orange tomatoes , and pale honeydew . The colors excited Lucy . As with the houses , she picked the brightest and the biggest . And though they were usually overripe and had to be thrown away sooner than the others , Gin always bought the fruits and vegetables Lucy carefully picked from the baskets and placed into her paper bag . But the honeydews were best ripe , when the juice was saturated with sugar and the flesh soft , and Gin took pride in her daughter for picking the best of that sweet fruit . <p> Lucy stood in front of the stall from Rosedale Farm , the stand with the biggest tomatoes and prettiest wildflowers . Gin watched her as she contemplated the tomatoes , picking each one up and looking all around it , giving it a little squeeze , then making her decision . <p> " Lucy , " she said , " how do you like living on the boat so far ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it . " <p> " Why ? " <p> " I think , " Lucy said , " because a lot of kids at school , their parents have boats . And they get to go out on weekends or when they visit their dads . But none of them live on them like we do . And I like to hear the water when I sleep . " <p> Gin felt guilty for questioning Lucy . It was something she had picked up from Max , who was never satisfied with a vague answer to a specific question . " I know you 're frightened to cross the Gulf , chicken , " he would say , " but why ? What about the crossing do n't you like ? " Or " I know you have trouble remembering foreign languages , but exactly what is it about Spanish that gives you trouble ? " His need for articulation and precision frustrated her . Gin trusted her instincts , her gut feeling . If the wind seemed a bit sinister in the harbor , then she did n't feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no knack for languages , then she 'd eat what she could order . But Max could n't accept such vagueness . He wanted to know why . She began demanding the same of him , questioning his statements and actions with the same persistence he used , hoping he would realize she did it in spite , that there was n't always an answer . Only he did n't mind . And just like Lucy , he always had an answer . <p> Lucy folded over the top of the bulging bag with her thin , awkward fingers . " Why 'd you want to know ? " she asked . <p> " Just curious , " Gin said , then paid the vendors for three tomatoes . <p> Puerto Rico was Gin 's favorite island , and the two months they spent there were the best time . They left many other ports on other islands unseen to spend the time in Puerto Rico , where they docked at the expensive marina in Fajardo and rented cars for weekend trips into the rain forest or to San Juan or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would take a week and circle the island , stopping in the fishing villages for breakfasts of beer and tacos . In some coastal towns , the ones with safe harbors and coves , expatriates mingled with the locals . Gin always envied their quick , smooth Spanish and the deep , sun-etched lines around their eyes and mouths that meant they had n't been to the States in years . In these small villages there was often a game of dominoes being played on an old , turned-over wooden barrel . Max would join the game , communicating easily with the other players . Gin had no interest in learning how to play dominoes . She enjoyed sitting at the open bar just off the horseshoe beach , relaxing and looking at the thick , green hills , the moored boats in the clear water , watching the tanned men and women ride dinghies into shore , and saying as little as possible . <p> " Cerveza y tacos , " she would say to the woman behind the bar ; then , holding up two fingers , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Pollo . " <p> Gin felt most comfortable in the bars and casinos in San Juan and Fajardo . Enough people spoke English that she could order food and drinks without the self-consciousness she felt in smaller towns . One night in San Juan , Max and Gin stayed at the Casa Blanca . They sat by the pool all day and played with the owner 's dog , a small white peekapoo named Patsy , who ran around sniffing the guests ' feet . Max made Gin order for them both , and she asked the bartender for Barrilito and fruit juice . They drank in the hot sun well into the afternoon , and just as Gin 's teeth became numb , they went to the casino . <p> Together , they played one slot machine , laughing whenever the cherries lined up and the bell sounded and they dove after the quarters that rolled onto the floor . Gin fed quarters , three at a time , while Max pulled the handle . When her hand found only the smooth plastic of the once-full cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> The rum took their minds out of the noisy casino , out of the lights and people and the filth of crumpled money passing through the hands of strangers . Gin and Max felt alone in the crowd , aware of the other gamblers only when bumped or pushed from behind . The fragments of conversation around them blended with laughter and the bells from the machines and the occasional joyous cries and applause of winners . <p> The more she drank , the more Gin tried to speak Spanish . The urge became uncontrollable , and she spoke the words quickly , without order or meaning . Walking back to the hotel , she pointed at cars . " Coche , " she said loudly . She pointed at her feet : " Mire , Max , zapatos . " When she saw a waiter squirting water at cats to chase them out of a restaurant 's patio , Gin said to him , " No , senor . Nos gustan los gatos . " <p> Max laughed . " Well , I think that 's the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took her arm and led her back to the hotel . " Come on , el pollo , let 's get some food . " <p> Gin laughed . " Did you just call me el pollo ? " <p> " Si , " he said . " El pollo . " <p> " I do n't think I like that nickname , Max . " <p> " Porque , chicken ? " <p> " You can call me that , " she said , " if you order dinner for me . No chicken . I want garlic shrimp and fried bananas . " <p> " Deal , " he said . <p> By the time the waiter brought the food , their excitement had worn off . They ate silently , carefully biting the prawns and placing the tails in rows on a plate between them . At a table near them , a woman sat with another couple . They were all tan and sharply dressed in lightweight linens that caught the breeze like the flame of a candle . The man 's long hair was slicked back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the same air of self-imposed dignity . The woman across from them smoked a cigarette , took slow drags and then lifted her head to blow the smoke into the air . A movement took Gin 's attention toward the floor , where a small boy sat fingering the woman 's long white skirt . There were many empty glasses on the table . <p> " Some people should n't have children , " she said . <p> " What ? " <p> " That woman in the white , " she said . Max followed her gaze . " How is that to raise a child , keeping him on the floor at your feet while you get drunk with your friends ? " <p> Max pushed his plate away . It clicked against the one in the center of the table . " And what lifestyle do you suppose you 're living ? " <p> " I do n't have children . " <p> " Yes , chicken , but what if you did ? " <p> " You mean , what if we did ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Then I suppose we 'd have to find one place to stay . Settle down . I do n't think cruising is conducive to raising a family . What do you think ? How would you feel if I did get pregnant ? " <p> " I would try not to feel anything , " Max said , lighting a cigarette . " That would make it easier when you had the abortion . " He smiled . <p> " What ? Are you going to pass that off as a joke ? " <p> Max leaned back , his face devoid of emotion . " I 've never seen myself as the father type . Now , let 's get a bottle of something from the bar and go down to the beach . " <p> Gin sat back and looked at him . He had lines around his green eyes and mouth and spoke Spanish smoothly . His hair , once brown , was sunbleached . Their cruising had started from a mutual restlessness that built to be too much ; the itching to pull up roots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that connected them to the safe world they had known . But somewhere along the way the restlessness ceased , and what pushed them around a small triangle in the Atlantic was the simple fact that they had been away from home too long to go back . Now Gin became tired of all the drinking and cruising . She felt like she had been living in a Hemingway novel , then realized that had been their goal from the beginning . A life of running away from responsibility , eternally wounded from a war that ended long before her life began , running from the very thing they faced every day out on the sea , the bigness of the ocean , the chilling thought of being alone and very small in something too large to comprehend . As she stood , Gin looked down at Max and said , " Hemingway 's dead . " She went to their room in the Casa Blanca alone . <p> It was not maternal instinct that fueled Gin 's anger and her desire to break the Max cycle . She had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never understood the selfless love of a mother , and she denied the existence of the biological clock . It was instead the running and the searching she and Max had done for the past years , sailing to the same ports looking for something they may have overlooked the last time , something to fill the holes left after all the loving and hating they could possibly do . They sought the atmosphere of their favorite bars and beaches , needing everything to find its way in , to keep them connected , because the ocean 's vastness , the strength of the wind and tide , and all that these meant were too much to take by oneself . They needed each other as much as they resented the need . <p> It all came down to one thing : Gin did n't want to be alone . <p> Lucy seldom asked about her father . When she did , Gin told her the truth . After they moved onto the tug , Lucy 's questioning became more frequent , especially on clear nights when the wind gently played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gin herself longed for the beaches and palm trees and drunken nights in casinos . She recognized and understood her daughter 's longing when Lucy looked off into the distance and lifted her face to the wind . It was the same as her own , a subtle nagging that said , There 's something going on out there that you need to see . <p> Gin knew from the hesitation in Lucy 's voice that she was going to ask about Max . " Mom , " Lucy said , then paused , assuring herself of Gin 's attention . " Do you think my father will ever come back ? " <p> " Yes . He 'll sail in one day , and you 'll meet him just as I did . " Gin held more faith in that than in anything in her life . But that faith dissolved when she thought of Max 's reaction to the daughter he knew nothing about . <p> " When will he come ? " <p> " When it 's right . " <p> " Am I anything like him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How ? " <p> " You 'll see when you meet him , " Gin said . <p> " Does it make you sad ? " Lucy 's voice was uncertain . <p> Gin softly pulled one of Lucy 's long brown curls and released it like a spring . " You 're too old for your body , " she said . <p> " Well , does it ? " <p> Looking at Lucy took away the anger she had once felt toward Max and left her with a tenderness she had never thought possible . She remembered the dizzy nights when they clung to each other and allowed the love they held down to emerge and embrace them , to protect them . The older Lucy got , the more Gin 's tenderness for Max prevailed , reduced the fear and anger of need to a small , painless black dot in her memory . " No , " Gin said , " it does n't make me sad at all . But you know what I 'm thinking ? " <p> " No , " Lucy said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep you in school here . That we 'll just take summers to go cruising and keep Charleston as our home for the rest of the year . ! think it will be good for us both to keep some roots . What do you say ? " <p> " I say that sounds good , " Lucy said . " That way it will be easier for my father to find us . " <p> " Do n't worry , baby . He will . " Gin smiled as she smoothed her daughter 's curls . " He will . " <p> <p> By D. PRINZO <p>
