And You Wonder Why We Get Called the Weird Watsons . It was one of those super-duper-cold Saturdays . One of those days that when you breathed out your breath kind of hung frozen in the air like a hunk of smoke and you could walk along and look exactly like a train blowing out big , fat , white puffs of smoke . It was so cold that if you were stupid enough to go outside your eyes would automatically blink a thousand times all by themselves , probably so the juice inside of them would n't freeze up . It was so cold that if you spit , the slob would be an ice cube before it hit the ground . It was about a zillion degrees below zero . It was even cold inside our house . We put sweaters and hats and scarves and three pairs of socks on and still were cold . The thermostat was turned all the way up and the furnace was banging and sounding like it was about to blow up but it still felt like Jack Frost had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real close together on the couch under a blanket . Dad said this would generate a little heat but he did n't have to tell us this , it seemed like the cold automatically made us want to get together and huddle up . My little sister , Joetta , sat in the middle and all you could see were her eyesbecause she had a scarf wrapped around her head . I was next to her and on the outside was my mother . Momma was the only one who was n't born in Flint so the cold was coldest to her . All you could see were her eyes too , and they were shooting bad looks at Dad . She always blamed him for bringing her all the way from Alabama to Michigan , a state she called a giant icebox . Dad was bundled next to Joey , trying to look at anything but Momma . Next to Dad , sitting with a little space between them , was my older brother , Byron . Byron had just turned thirteen so he was officially a teenage juvenile delinquent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch anybody or let anybody touch him , even if it meant he froze to death . Byron had tucked the blanket between him and Dad down into the cushion of the couch to make sure he could n't be touched . Dad turned on the TV to try to make us forget how cold we were but all that did was get him in trouble . There was a special news report on Channel 12 telling how bad the weather was and Dad groaned when the guy said , " If you think it 's cold now , wait until tonight , the temperature is expected to drop into record-low territory , possibly reaching the negative twenties ! In fact , we wo n't be seeing anything above zero for the next four to five days ! " He was smiling when he said this but none of the Watson family thought it was funny . We all looked over at Dad . He just shook his head and pulled the blanket over his eyes . Then the guy on the TV said , " Here 's a little something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some hope for the future : The temperature in Atlanta , Georgia is forecast to reach . . . " Dad coughed real loud and jumped off the couch to turn the TV off but we all heard the weatherman say , " . . . the mid-seventies ! " The guy might as well have tied Dad to a tree and said , " Ready , aim , fire ! " " Atlanta ! " Momma said . " That 's a hundred and fifty miles from home ! " " Wilona . . . , " Dad said . " I knew it , " Momma said . " I knew I should have listened to Moses Henderson ! " " Who ? " I asked . Dad said , " Oh Lord , not that sorry story . You 've got to let me tell about what happened with him . " Momma said , " There 's not a whole lot to tell , just a story about a young girl who made a bad choice . But if you do tell it , make sure you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as close as we could get because we knew Dad was going to try to make us forget about being cold by cutting up . Me and Joey started smiling right away , and Byron tried to look cool and bored . " Kids , " Dad said , " I almost was n't your father . You guys came real close to having a clown for a daddy named Hambone Henderson . . . . " " Daniel Watson , you stop right there . You 're the one who started that ' Hambone ' nonsense . Before you started that everyone called him his Christian name , Moses . And he was a respectable boy too , he was n't a clown at all . " " But the name stuck did n't it ? Hambone Henderson . Me and your granddaddy called him that because the boy had a head shaped like a hambone , had more knots and bumps on his head than a dinosaur . So as you guys sit here giving me these dirty looks because it 's a little chilly outside ask yourselves if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life being known as the Hambonettes . " Me and Joey cracked up , Byron kind of chuckled and Momma put her hand over her mouth . She did this whenever she was going to give a smile because she had a great big gap between her front teeth . If Momma thought something was funny , first you 'd see her trying to keep her lips together to hide the gap , then , if the smile got to be too strong , you 'd see the gap for a hot second before Momma 's hand would come up to cover it , then she 'd crack up too . Laughing only encouraged Dad to cut up more , so when he saw the whole family thinking he was funny he really started putting on a show . He stood up in front of the TV . " Yup , Hambone Henderson proposed to your mother around the same time I did . Fought dirty too , told your momma a pack of lies about me and when she did n't believe them he told her a pack of lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Hambone guy . " Wilona , I heard tell about the weather up that far north in Flint , Mitch-again , heard it 's colder than inside an icebox . Seen a movie about it , think it was made in Flint . Movie called Nanook of the North . Yup , do believe for sure it was made in Flint . Uh-huh , Flint , Mitch-again . " " Folks there live in these things called igloos . According to what I seen in this here movie most folks in Flint is Chinese . Do n't believe I seem nan one colored person in the whole dang city . You a ' Bama gal , do n't believe you 'd be too happy living in no igloo . Ai n't got nothing against ' em , but do n't believe you 'd be too happy living ' mongst a whole slew of Chinese folks . Do n't believe you 'd like the food . Only thing them Chinese folks in that movie et was whales and seals . Do n't believe you 'd like no whale meat . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like pork at all . " Momma pulled her hand away from her mouth . " Daniel Watson , you are one lying man ! Only thing you said that was true was that being in Flint is like living in an igloo . I knew I should have listened to Moses . Maybe these babies mighta been born with lumpy heads but at least they'da had warm lumpy heads ! " You know Birmingham is a good place , and I do n't mean the weather either . The life is slower , the people are friendlier " " Oh yeah , " Dad interrupted , " they 're a laugh a minute down there . Let 's see , where was that ' Coloreds Only ' bathroom downtown ? " " Daniel , you know what I mean , things are n't perfect but people are more honest about the way they feel " she took her mean eyes off Dad and put them on Byron " and folks there do know how to respect their parents . " Byron rolled his eyes like he did n't care . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couch 's cushion . Dad did n't like the direction the conversation was going so he called the landlord for the hundredth time . The phone was still busy . " That snake in the grass has got his phone off the hook . Well , it 's going to be too cold to stay here tonight , let me call Cydney . She just had that new furnace put in , maybe we can spend the night there . " Aunt Cydney was kind of mean but her house was always warm so we kept our fingers crossed that she was home . Everyone , even Byron , cheered when Dad got Aunt Cydney and she told us to hurry over before we froze to death . Dad went out to try and get the Brown Bomber started . That was what we called our car . It was a 1948 Plymouth that was dull brown and real big , Byron said it was turd brown . Uncle Bud gave it to Dad when it was thirteen years old and we 'd had it for two years . Me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time it did n't like to start up in the winter . After five minutes Dad came back in huffing and puffing and slapping his arms across his chest . " Well , it was touch and go for a while , but the Great Brown One pulled through again ! " Everyone cheered , but me and Byron quit cheering and started frowning right away . By the way Dad smiled at us we knew what was coming next . Dad pulled two ice scrapers out of his pocket and said , " O.K. , boys , let 's get out there and knock those windows out . " We moaned and groaned and put some more coats on and went outside to scrape the car 's windows . I could tell by the way he was pouting that Byron was going to try and get out of doing his share of he work . " I 'm not going to do your part , Byron , you 'd better do it and I 'm not playing either . " " Shut up , punk . " I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hacking away at the scab of ice that was all over the windows . I finished Momma 's window and took a break . Scraping ice off of windows when it 's that cold can kill you ! I did n't hear any sound coming from the other side of the car so I yelled out , " I 'm serious , Byron , I 'm not doing that side too , and I 'm only going to do half the windshield , I do n't care what you do to me . " The windshield on the Bomber was n't like the new 1963 cars , it had a big bar running down the middle of it , dividing it in half . " Shut your stupid mouth , I got something more important to do right now . " I peeked around the back of the car to see what By was up to . The only thing he 'd scraped off was the outside mirror and he was bending down to look at himself in it . He saw me and said , " You know what , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't no way two folks as ugly as your momma and daddy coulda give birth to someone as sharp as me ! " He was running his hands over his head like he was brushing his hair . I said , " Forget you , " and went back over to the other side of the car to finish the back window . I had half of the ice off when I had to stop again and catch my breath . I heard Byron mumble my name . I said , " You think I 'm stupid ? It 's not going to work this time . " He mumbled my name again . It sounded like his mouth was full of something . I knew this was a trick , I knew this was going to be How to Survive a Blizzard , Part Two . How to Survive a Blizzard , Part One had been last night when I was outside playing in the snow and Byron and his running buddy , Buphead , came walking by . Buphead has officially been a juvenile delinquent even longer than Byron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " you wan na learn somethin ' that might save your stupid life one day ? " I should have known better , but I was bored and I think maybe the cold weather was making my brain slow , so I said , " What 's that ? " " We gon na teach you how to survive a blizzard . " " How ? " Byron put his hands in front of his face and said " This is the most important thing to remember , O.K. ? " " Why ? " " Well , first we got ta show you what it feels like to be trapped in a blizzard . You ready ? " He whispered something to Buphead and they both laughed . " I 'm ready . " I should have known that the only reason Buphead and By would want to play with me was to do something mean . " O.K. , " By said , " first thing you got ta worry about is high winds . " Byron and Buphead each grabbed one of my arms and one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woo , blizzard warnings ! Blizzard warnings ! Wooo ! Take cover ! " Buphead counted to three and on the third swing they let me go in the air . I landed headfirst in a snowbank . But that was O.K. because I had on three coats , two sweaters , a T-shirt , three pairs of pants and four socks along with a scarf , a hat and a hood . These guys could n't have hurt me if they 'd thrown me off the Empire State Building ! ' After I climbed out of the snowbank they started laughing and so did I. " Cool , Baby Bruh , " By said , " you passed that part of the test with a B-plus , what you think , Buphead ? " Buphead said , " Yeah , I 'd give the little punk a A. " They whispered some more and started laughing again . " O.K. , " By said , " second thing you got ta learn is how to keep your balance in a high wind . You got ta be good at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dens . " They put me in between them and started making me spin round and round , it seemed like they spun me for about half an hour . When slob started flying out of my mouth they let me stop and I wobbled around for a while before they pushed me back in the same snow-bank . When everything stopped going in circles I got up and we all laughed again . They whispered some more and then By said , " What you think , Buphead ? He kept his balance a good long time , I 'm gon na give him a A-minus . " " I ai n't as hard a grader as you , I'ma give the little punk a double A-minus . " " O.K. , Kenny now the last part of Surviving a Blizzard , you ready ? " " Yup ! " " You passed the wind test and did real good on the balance test but now we got ta see if you ready to graduate . You remember what we told you was the most important part about survivin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we go . Buphead , tell him ' bout the final exam . "
