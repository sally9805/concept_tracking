Making the Landscape Your Own When artist Kate Palmer first traveled to New Mexico 's Sangre de Cristo Mountains , she was so taken with the landscape she found there that she decided to become a part of it . <p> The light that gilds the peaks of New Mexico 's Sangre de Cristo Mountains tends to leave a profound impression on visitors . Four centuries ago , Franciscan monks witnessed the ethereal glow cast upon the peaks by the setting sun and gave them a name meaning " the Blood of Christ . " More recently , oil painter Kate Palmer was so captivated by their beauty that she moved her home and studio to the foothills of the Sangres to immerse herself in the landscape she finds so deeply inspiring . <p> " Light is the real subject of my paintings , " the artist asserts . " And it was the vibrant light of the high desert that initially drew me to New Mexico . Light is the harmonizer , the common denominator that changes everything it touches . " This fascination is clear in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees , grass , and clouds suffused with the reflected amber light of the setting sun , and Evening of the Snowfall , in which a warm , red glow illuminates every element of an early January scene of the Galisteo Creek . She prefers to work in the early morning and late evening , when as she says , " the sun is low , shadows are long , colors are intense , and the light is magical . " <p> A student of such " magic , " Palmer is exacting in her description of light . For instance , while Tesuque Evening convincingly evokes the crisp , clear light in the high desert air of New Mexico , the artist renders the contrasting diffuse glow of the moist clime of the California coast between Monterey and Carmel in Asilomar Morning just as compellingly . <p> However , to capture a reality that exists beyond mere physical features , Palmer begins all her paintings with abstract patterns of color designed to convey the essence of a subject . " Painting is an interpretation , a translation , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against another , I am freed from the literal to achieve a sense of place . I use these patterns to establish the rhythm of the piece with passages of lights and darks , which will move the viewer through the painting . How far I carry this process along the spectrum of abstract to realistic is a personal and emotional decision based on the particulars of a scene to how much light I have left to paint by . " For example , in First Show she limited the composition to the essentials . " The patterns were strong enough to carry the painting , " she explains , " and time was short . " <p> When working on location , Palmer uses thin , transparent washes of oil paint to quickly establish an approximation of the finished painting . She stresses that getting the main components of the painting down helps to sustain the initial inspiration for the piece . In this first phase , she works out the problems of the painting , its rhythm , and the major compositional elements . She uses the strongest values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since she finds that " the darkest darks and the lightest lights tend to be the easiest to see , so you are more likely to get them right . " She suggests that artists find an area of the composition they know is right and proceed from there . Typically , she establishes the saturated darks first , making them rich , pure , and very dark . A spot of the lightest light gives her the tonal range of the work . " From then on , it 's a question of making comparisons : warmer or cooler , lighter or darker , " she says . " In this way , you 're better equipped to find the more difficult middle tones . " She then blocks in the large areas with colors similar to what she sees to establish the overall sense of the painting . " The colors may be close , but the values should be dead on , " she emphasizes . The artist considers some of these small on-site paintings to be finished works , and also uses them as studies for larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in much the same way as in the field . In addition to her on-location sketches and internalized sense of the site , she uses 35mm slides to provide additional information , but warns that these can be deceptive , distorting important elements such as color , values , and perspective . Even when working on a studio painting , she repeatedly returns to the original site under different light conditions and seasons to fully know the places she paints . Breaking Waves , for instance , displays her intimate knowledge of the California coast between Carmel and Monterey , which has become her second home for painting during the past several years . This allows her to build a relationship with her subjects , permitting them to seep into her subconscious and become a part of her . Palmer relishes the way her internalization of a place can inform her depiction of it . " This is what gives a work its depth , its shades of meaning that exist beyond the obvious , " she says . <p> Palmer believes that no single approach suits all conditions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be more creative . She continues to experiment with new colors , brushes , and painting surfaces . For example , while First Snow was painted almost entirely with a No. 6 sable brush , used both to apply thin washes and scoop up thick paint like a shovel , in Vallecitos Valley , she used a No. 810 Che son palette knife to apply the paint in sweeping strokes , some thick , some thin . Her plein air kit includes these tools as well as a larger No. 12 red sable brush , Nos. 2 , 4 , and 6 filbert bristle brushes , and Luco badger hair filberts Nos. 8 , 10 , and 12 . The artist 's palette consists of cadmium yellow light , cadmium orange , cadmium red light , yellow ochre , burnt sienna , alizarin crimson , sap green , viridian , ultramarine blue , cerulean blue , and La Franc &; Bourgeois ' titanium white . She may vary these colors in different locales , substituting turquoise or cobalt blue for cerulean blue , for example . To keep colors vibrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alizarin crimson and sap green , which yields a rich , clear brown . <p> The artist employs a variety of painting surfaces to achieve different effects . For instance , Tesuque Evening and Snowy River were painted on acrylic-primed Masonite panels , which she prepared by applying four to six layers of Liquitex acrylic gesso without sanding between the layers . The advantage of this surface is that it is very absorbent ; thin washes laid down in the beginning dry quickly , allowing her to build layers of paint wet over dry in a single session . In both paintings , Palmer used this technique to create a luminous effect from layers of transparent paint applied over a white ground . Asilomar Morning and Breaking Waves , on the other hand , were painted on Claessens double oil-primed Belgian linen canvas mounted on Masonite . The artist likes the feel and texture of the weave of this surface and the fluidity with which wet paint can be moved around on the linen and prefers it when painting wet-in-wet . <p> Since 1996 , Palmer has won 15 national and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1998 Antonio Cirino Memorial Award from the Annual Members Exhibition of the Salamagundi Club ; the 1996 Gene Magazzini Memorial Award from The Allied Artists of America 83rd Annual Exhibition ; the 1998 Art Times Award from the Catharine Lorillard Wolfe Art Club ; and the 1998 Jack Richeson &; Company/Best Artists Products Award from Audubon Artists , all based in New York City .
