Kazakhstan . Me and Jon 're standing in a jumble of rocks outside the scarred bubbletown that the last people who gave us a lift went into . Sunlight whites out the sky . Cars zip past overhead , so far up that I can only see a glinting stream flowing from horizon ' to horizon . Sweat trickles down inside my whitesuit . I hope they do n't start the civil war again until we get the hell out of this skanky little republic . <p> I close my eyes , concentrating on the rainbow-on-black display behind my lids which is worldspace 's version of the airway , and stick out my info thumb . Help us out , I yell in my street-gleaned English , please , we got ta make the Western Hemisphere by p.m . ! Come on you motherfuckers ! Tight asses ! <p> Right now the cars overhead are seeing my and Jon 's I.D.s flash up , proving that we 're safe , but nothing changes , all the little blips keep moving . Eyes still closed , fumbling with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back from my inner arm and key the signal to keep repeating . <p> Open . Over by the bubbletown , near-naked women and kids with cancerous skin are hoeing what looks like red dust . Now and again they glance suspiciously at us . They have lasers slung across their backs . <p> A mutant rat scuttles between the rocks . <p> Jon flops down on our suitcase and heaves a sigh . His protective suit billows around his gangly body . He does n't say anything , but I know he 's remembering that he told me to leave my whitesuit in our apartment for Daqing City to confiscate along with the rest of our things . I hated leaving the minute Mother died , but something cracked in me , and I knew it was our only chance . No Chinese , not even NPRC cadres , expect a daughter to take off when her mother 's not mourned or even buried . To get back at us , the city 'll sell everything Mother had , everything me and Jon had , too , to start paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grab you and suck you down . Once someone close to you dies , that 's it , you 're screwed . Jon did n't care : he 'd have been happy to sink into the snowdrift , scribbling away at his novel , as long as I was beside him . i made him come cause I need his citizenship to get into America . He told me the temp in Boston reaches forty C. Well , how was I supposed to believe him ? I never was anywhere that there is n't snow on the ground , and it 's acid , too . Even little kids know if they take off their whitesuits , they 're dead . I do n't think I could take mine off now . It 'd be like ripping out my trodes . Nakedness . <p> Jon opens his eyes and says in putonghua , which I must admit he speaks as well as I do , " Xiao . I just found a bounty the Vanuwes put on my head three years ago . You have n't used my I.D . to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I scowl at him . But inside my hood , I suck my teeth in worry . He does n't risk offending me unless something is seriously wrong . " ' S probably a blanket trace on anyone linked with your father . Jesus , your trodes dropped out of worldspace six years ago ! They only took notice of your dad three years ago ! " <p> He squints behind his visor . " Xiao , I 've been scouting . The Vanuwes 've expanded since they swallowed my family 's corp . Their prints are everywhere . It really would n't be good if they found me . " <p> Shit , I think , and I slither my hand inside my sleeve and blank Jon 's I.D . off the signal . Pray Buddha I have n't done something really dumb . " Do n't be so stiff . They probably do n't even care about you . " <p> " Xiaoling , they killed  --  " <p> " I know . " I recite in singsong , looking into the sky , " Jon Carneira senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a crooked world . Poor motherfucker . So the Vanuwes killed him , killed his whole family , and swallowed your corp . " <p> " I do n't think they 're going to give up until they finish the job . " <p> I do n't buy the saintly picture Jon paints of his father , but I 'm ready to believe these Vanuwe ratfaces killed old Carneira , if only cause he screwed them over . We have Vanuwes in Daqing , too , on a lesser scale . Like my boss at Kuocorp . We used to find bodies in suits down the sewers all the time . But Jon seems too innocent to 've had a corporate for a father : he 's committed his life to writing a novel on paper . Paper ! No one 's gon na print it , let alone read it , not even in America , and he says he does n't care . He has straight brown hair , no physique , and old-fashioned specs that make his blue eyes blend into his pale skin . I accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would take Mother and me back to America with him in a couple of months . Even then , I was scared her immuno-resistance was weakening . Then a distant relative of Jon 's came by , traveling under a layer of aliases a kilometer thick , and told him what happened . So he never went back . But by then it was too late , I 'd married him . I had a good few sleepless nights over that one . <p> His only redeeming feature , as far as I can see , is that he 's crazy over me and will do anything for me , though I 've never let him lay a finger on me . ( And Mother used to ask why we did n't have any children ! ) Even on our wedding night I would n't share a bed with him , so he let me have the bed and he slept on the floor . Sometimes , indoors , when I take off my whitesuit , I see him following me with his eyes , but he never ever tries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain . I ca n't . But I tell you this , it makes having things my way taste a bit sourer than I expected . <p> " Well , if the Vanuwes 're that single-minded , they 're sure to find you sooner or later , " I tell him , not cause I believe it , but to provoke him . I think we can beat them at their game . Hell , cyberspace is my game ! Sitting in a software plant all day 's so damn boring that it makes you red hot for whatever you do at night . And if that 's not sex , you 're bound to get pretty good at something . I think even in worldspace I can cope . I know Daqing cyberspace inside and out : me and the girls from Kuocorp thought we were such punks , using it as a hangout , a place to escape our husbands when we could n't hit the sewers for the snow . I guess we never really realized we were living in a bubble . But at five this morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed out . Worldspace is like a crowd of people murmuring at you day and night , pressing so dose you ca n't move . I ca n't believe Jon grew up in this static . But he did n't get trodes until he was twelve , he told me , in America it 's illegal to implant them any younger than that . At home they implant you as soon as you 're born . <p> Maybe that 's why the NPRC is the most powerful nation in the world , and America is sinking deeper into anarchy every year . <p> Me , I do n't care if it 's one howling wilderness , as long as I can get in , get a divorce from Jon , and get free . No Mother keeping on and on at me about grandchildren . No school . No Kuocorp . Nothing . <p> I look at Jon . His shoulders are hunched . He worries his lower lip . His hands wring each other like two mice fighting inside the sleeves of his protective suit . <p> " But maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's not like you 're any danger to them . " <p> His back straightens . His Adam 's apple jogs as he swallows . The sun shins on the tip of his nose . " You 're wrong . I 'm going to hunt them down . And carve my revenge out of them . " <p> " Jesus , " I say disgustedly . He is deadly serious . I turn my back on him Tan Xiaoling Carneira , Jon Carneira ! inside my head , and east of the bubbletown , a car is swooping down , growing larger and larger , stabilizing its forward motion with thrust until it settles in a puff of dust . " Come on ! " I run toward the car . I leave Jon to carry the duffel , as a matter of fact to come or not as he wants at this point cause I 'm really pissed off with his stupidity . I hide my relief that the car has stopped . I was afraid we 'd be here forever , alone . I hear a report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It bounces with the impact , like an impatient child . Hurry , hurry ! flashes in worldspace . I start to run . Jon flounders behind . <p> " I am writing a novel , " Mr. Melchisedec P. Assad says in English as we merge up into the airway with a muted roar of thrust . " That is why I pick the hitchhikers . I am harvesting material from the shores of the world . As the beachcomber strolling along the sandy shore , or the oily promenade , these days , but let us not be distracted by details , as he harvests the fruit of the tides , thus , thus 1 harvest the experience of the human race . " He has a florid , dark face . Meaty hands on the steering-wheel . This cat 's the chilliest thing I ever saw . The Kazakhs ' beat-up Puffster disappointed the hell out of me : this 's more like it . Soundproofed , so you can actually talk . Room behind the suede seats to stand up and stretch your legs . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cocktails , calmly ignoring the laserbeams zinging on the shell of his car . <p> " I ca n't believe this , " Jon says , grinning broadly . When I first saw him , sitting in the back of my schoolroom my senior year , looking out at us with a pad of paper on his knee , he had this same retarded grin on his face . " I 'm writing a novel too ! " <p> " Really ? On paper. ? " Assad turns to him . <p> " Yes ! I 'm fictionalizing the resurgence of Communism in China . " <p> " But this is fascinating . My work with history was also my inspiration . Ancient myths and legends ; actual paper fragments ; papyrus ; stone  --  " <p> " Mr. Assad , if you 're any good , you should write real novels , " I say harshly . " People read those . Even back home , in this little Chinese city I 'm not gon na name , we used to swap cartridges at school and access them when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what I say in putonghua . I do n't know how my patchy English ' mangles it . But he has listened gravely . " But , my dear , the book on paper is not basically a communication tool , but an art form . Has your friend here ever explained it to you in detail ? " I can see that even if I say yes , he 's going to explain it again . " The words are printed one after another . No layering . One can only move through it in one direction , forward , and the ending is a fixed thing : it does not respond to the wishes of the reader ! " <p> " But are n't you having trouble committing to a single resolution ? " ; on breaks in . Happy as a baby . Forgotten all about his precious Vanuwes . <p> I get up , leaving them interrupting each other so passionately that Assad takes his hands off the wheel to gesticulate , and move back . I lock myself in the tiny rest room and stare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hands , drag them down my cheeks . <p> Why did ; on ever fall in love with this ? What does he see in this specter ? <p> Black hair chopped off raggedly around my face ; rat-tail coils round my neck like a choker . Skin that 's never seen sun . Little slit eyes . People tell me I look Korean . I 'm as fat as a swaddled baby in the phur-lined whitesuit Mother bought me for my fifteenth birthday . <p> Mother . Because I had to get to the west , you do n't even get an honorable burial for all the years you gave me . I rip the whitesuit off , bumping the door so that it quivers in its flanges . Stuff it in the toilet and flush . With a monstrous choking sound , the whitesuit vanishes , and I imagine phur mixed with sewage fluttering down on a mile-wide area of Turkestan . At least now I can see my body . My collarbone is as sharp as the ridge that a metal-wheeled bike leaves in the mud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wear khaki Army cast-offs and a red brocade shirt that I did n't want to leave behind , held together with safety pins . I undo a pin , lift the shirt . My stomach is literally concave . I 'm losing flesh off my bones . I need a food pill . Too bad . <p> Both men turn to look at me when I come out . Mr. Assad 's eyebrows go up and his thick lips purse . " Keep your eyes on the fucking air , man , " I say , and Jon wraps an arm around my waist and drags me close to him , violently , so that I am squashed between the two front seats . Mr. Assad smiles and says something to Ion in a language I think is French . <p> " Melchisedec is very kind , " Jon says , not in putonghua but in the Daqing dialect that hardly anyone uses . His voice is expressionless . " He 's treating us to a free vacation at Legend . We 're going to stay with him in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week or two , okay ? " <p> " What 's Legend. ? " <p> Assad hears the word , beams at me and says proudly : " My creation . I have never married , so I suppose one could say that it is my child . " <p> Jon explains , " It 's an adventure park . Based on the myths and legends of the whole world . On a manmade island off the coast of Eritrea  --  that 's a country in East Africa . It 's supposed to be the world 's Eighth Wonder . " <p> Shit . I 'm reminded of the way my boss at Kuocorp used to invite the prettiest girls to stay at his climate-controlled mansion in Beijing . " Why the fuck are we going ? " <p> " Xiao , I do n't think we have much choice . " <p> I stare at Assad . He steers dexterously , arms wrapped round the wheel like it is a girl . He is smiling . The cyberspace visual , in a tank embedded in the dashboard , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of us . He is speeding . <p> I wrap my arms around myself . " Dirty old Euro  --  " I am close to tears . <p> Jon lowers his voice , and I realize he 's afraid of bugs , translators , or whatever else , and that he 's right . " I think it 's me . " <p> " He wants your scrawny ass ? " I twist away , look Jon up and down . Ca n't imagine anybody ever thinking he is  --  <p> " No ! " He lets out an explosive sigh . " He 's connected me with the bounty posted by the Vanuwes . I should have expected this . Should n't have been so open with him . His kind is always ready to recycle their own mother for a few bucks . " <p> " In the Master 's name , " I hiss . I grab Jon 's shoulder . Mr. Assad waggles an eyebrow inquiringly . So fucking deceptive , that fat friendly face . Still in Daqing dialect , " Come on , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Do n't be a little idiot ! " Jon never talks to me that way . I fall still in shock . " Men of this kind do n't travel unprotected ! We know the cat 's fully laserproof . We 're sitting in a maximum security vault . There 'll be explosives on every door , on the controls , on the bloody air vents  --  " <p> And I see the visuals have changed . We 're swooping down out of the airway into a dense swarm of cars , stubby-winged pastry puffs swooping past so close they fill the windshield , and then without warning a happy-faced clown brandishing a book painted on a landing pad plummets up at us as fast as if we are falling . <p> Secrets of the tarot ! " <p> The smell of chocolate fudge wafts across the fairway . Saliva fills my mouth . <p> " Relive your ancestors ' lives ! New bio-memory tech ! " <p> Do I love this place or does it make me vomit ? Ca n't make up my mind . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to look like a Moroccan souk , whatever that was . As noisy as Kuocorp gates at the end of a shift , I can tell you that , and the stall keepers got a blistering hard sell . The sideshow bouncers 're even worse . <p> " Do you have criminal tendencies ? Accredited phrenologist tells all ! " <p> " The ambrosia of the Greek Gods ! Only one credit ! " <p> And all the time , boulders , which are actually cars filled with laughing , screaming people , whistle overhead , hurled by a red-haired giant who ( the part of him I can see over the booths , anyway ) looks fucking realistic even though he 's twenty meters tall and anchored to the ground . On the other side of the souk , the boulders are landing in a tank of sea . The drops splatting on my face might have come from there , or they might just have come off the chickens being boiled in that stall there . I 'm gon na buy something to eat soon . Real food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to digest it ? Jon could tell me , but he 's gone . Finished . Dead . By this time anyway . <p> I get my ears pierced . My lobes are flaming hot and the earrings feel funny against my jaw  --  but I have to do something to celebrate . <p> " I flatter myself in believing you will like the park , " Assad asshole said to me after breakfast , when we were standing in the ninetieth-floor lounge of his scraper , looking down at the huge , wobbling , flashing bubble that covers Legend . " Many of our patrons are regular customers . As water flows to the low places . We hardly need to advertise anymore . " <p> Jon smiled sickly . What 's he doing quoting the Tao ? I thought , and I did n't answer . I could n't sleep last night in spite of us having had a waterbed ; Jon did n't either . We lay there on our backs not speaking . <p> Over by the other window-wall , an African girl in violet chiffon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American kids  --  hitchhikers too , suckers who Assad caught just like he caught us , for whatever they were worth  --  were playing cards . Some game I do n't know . They were laughing . You 're gon na get chewed up and spit out , too , I warned them inside my head , and I looked down through the glass . Far off over the sea , I could see Eritrea , like a shadow . Mr. Assad grabbed my hand in his big soft one , making me jump . Digging into his trousers pocket , he stuffed my fist with Legend credits . I have n't even counted them yet . " Buy yourself something pretty . " He sounded almost worried . " These rags simply do n't do , my dear . " <p> " What about you and Jon ? " I said suspiciously . " What you gon na do ? " <p> Jon grabbed me . He was pale , his lower lip red with biting . " Get out , Xiao ! " he whispered . " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't waste your chance ! " <p> He was right . What was I thinking ? " Sorry . Yeah . " My heart thudded . Ducking my head to Assad asshole , I went for the elevator . I could feel Jon wanting me to wave or blow a kiss or something . I did n't . While I dropped like a stone in the gilded box of the elevator , so fast I felt dizzy , I said aloud , " You crazy , girl ? Fuck America ! Fuck Jon ! You 're free , right now right here , free ! " <p> And I like this place . Hate to give that to Assad , but I do like it . ' S chill . Assad was right about my rags , too  --  I 've caught quite a few tourists giving me funny glances cause my Chinese face and my punk hair and the cast-offs all together mark me out . As soon as I find the right store I 'm gon na buy  --  <p> " The Three Fates tell your darkest secrets ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near-naked bouncer grins at me . " Do n't you wan na know if you really love him , Punksie ? " <p> " I 'm married , " I say , but then I remember I 'm not , not anymore . <p> I glance up at the velvet-draped entrance . Blink into cyberspace  --  the cloth 's real , the bouncer 's just a collection of interface chips . Almost desperately , I think , I got ta spend some of this cash ! I duck through a gaggle of Indian tourists and stick a thousand-credit bill in the bouncer 's hand . <p> " That 's a lot of money , Punksie  --  " <p> " Better not charge me extra , skanker , " I say . But I barely glance at the change he gives me before I slip inside . <p> The noise of the crowd shuts off like somebody hit a switch . <p> Panic . I ca n't see , but I can feel the open space all around me . More space than could possibly fit in the booth . More space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And my eyes adjust to the light . And the sun is brilliant , fresh , and I 'm standing on a green cliff under a huge blue windy sky . Far below , the sea murmurs on rocks . On my other side , grassy dunes roll gently away into a haze . The slopes are dotted with yellow-and-white flowers . The wind blowing in my face smells salty . Nothing moves in the whole huge vista except my hair , ruffling in the wind . A drop of sweat runs down between my shoulder blades . There is n't a sound except the sea on the rocks . <p> And my rat-tail lashes my cheek as I break , and whirl round , gasping , but the entrance is gone , it 's gone  --  <p> Eyes shut . Cyberspace . <p> You idiot , Xiao . <p> Colored mesh on black shows me the form of a low , empty tunnel stretching straight for a hundred meters . The booth . Nothing to be afraid of . It 's all an illusion . Only one way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . <p> But you 're not gon na back out , are you , Xiao ? Your mother always told you not to take no risks , syaujye , cause the officials they all the time look for somebody to pick on land outside the tunnel , the souk is teaming with color-mesh people , information coating their surfaces like oil , like they 're in a giant 's stir fry ) and that means you just about have to stick with this , do n't you , Xiao ? <p> Nails dig into palms . Breath ragged . I open my eyes . <p> Violet bowl of sky . Woolly clouds skimming along the horizon . Relax . I kneel down : the turf smells sharp . This is green itself . I pick one of the white flowers and put a petal on my tongue . Of course there 's no substance to it , but it evaporates with a bitter taste that makes my mouth go all sweet with saliva . <p> Fuck , the sea 's a long way down . <p> A sandy path leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I start walking . <p> The wind whistles softly in the grass . The path curves and dips and then dives over the edge of the cliff . I look down . There 's a ledge carved out of the reddish rock . Steep , but I can see places for handholds . I edge down . My hip hurts for real when I bang it on the rock . <p> And the cliff vanishes from under my hands and I tumble sideways , into a square , sunken pit brimful of sun . Three sides are vertical rock ; the other is open to the view . Every time I move , I crush flowers that cover the turf like thick pile on velvet . <p> I see them . <p> One of them is blonde . <p> One is dead . <p> So is the third . <p> All three of them are  --  were  --  white girls my age , or a little older , sprawling naked against the back of the pit . <p> " Ask and we will answer , " the living one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Eastern European . She sits in the middle , with an arm around each of the others . Both of them have lips parted and eyes half lidded like they 're sleeping , but the way their limbs are jumbled tells me they 're ready to be dressed for burial . " You need keep no secrets from yourself any longer . " Her eyes go blank for a moment . " Tan Xiaoling Carneira . You are a defector from the New People 's Republic of China . You are eighteen . Your father died when you were three . Your mother died three days ago . " <p> " What the fuck , " I whisper in amazement . Then I remember . This is a damn good illusion  --  but that 's all it is . They 're cybervisions . Illusions . I shut my eyes . <p> The undulating wall of the tunnel , rainbow on blackish-red . No blinking bits to indicate that any new chip is interfacing with my trodes . <p> Open . Three girls . <p> Close . Nothing . <p> Open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 're real . But you do n't have trodes . " <p> " Ask and we will answer . " Another one is speaking now . The one on the left . She 's a brunette and her breasts are a bit fuller  --  but she was dead ! <p> " Who are you ? " <p> The blonde slumps against her side , eyes vacant , reflecting the sky , one hand slack on the other girl 's thigh . <p> " We are Scarecrow , Nightmare , and Stickjoint . What do you wish to know ' " Scarecrow 's forehead wrinkles briefly . " Your mother died when  --  " and her voice shifts , so that if I did n't know better , I 'd think I was hearing a recording of myself  --  " when the heater went on the blink in the middle of the night  --  " <p> And the voice changes  --  " and you just shivered and curled tighter , too tired to get up and fix it , and when where her soul got out .

I 'm the youngest . I have the best idea of what it is to have to live in a welter of illusions , the way you outsiders do . " She fixes me with a green gaze . " Just let yourself love him , Xiaoling ! Why do you torture yourself like this ? " <p> I wo n't hear this . I wo n't . I grab her hand , rubbing the skin suspiciously . It 's warm and smooth , but old scars bracelet her wrist . " Who are you ? Where do you come from ? " <p> " Is that what you want to hear ? " She curls her fingers around my hand . I wrench away .

You did all you could for her , as she did for you , flesh of her flesh . Our mother sold us to a traveling circus . She was afraid of us . We nearly lost our minds when people crowded around our cages , ogling us , because we could not keep from speaking all of their memories at once , disjointedly . They thought we were speaking in tongues . They moved us to a church . It was Melchisedec Assad 's kindness that saved us . He bought us and brought us here , where we are safe .

There 's something underneath the illusion , then , though I never was anywhere so real as this sunny cliff . Never saw a blizzard as vast as this sky . <p> " Where are we really ? " I beg . " Are we sitting in a little dark tent ? Where ? " <p> Stickjoint laughs . " You climbed six flights of stairs . You did n't know it , though  --  there is an illusion that protects our privacy .

Such an enormous gap between illusion and reality , and it 's so difficult to see any gap at all  --  Nightmare sits up again , pushing Stickjoint 's body aside , and my voice spills from between her lips . Daqing dialect , nearly incomprehensible with passion . " I love him . Oh God oh God , I love him , and I 'm letting him die , just like I let Mother die . But it 's not too late . Not this time .

Rock crumbles under my boots , and I 'm falling <p> through the side of the booth <p> fighting my way free of the folds of velvet . I 'm in a narrow , dank alley between two booths . The smells of chocolate and olive oil and burnt sugar hit my nostrils , and the voices of the tourists crash into my ears like cymbals on either side of my head , and I stagger under the sheer weight of sensation . The bouncer looks down the alley at me , frowning under his bald unreal brows . " Punksie ! " <p> I take off at a run . <p> And they 're all around me now .

But I ca n't escape the NPRC either , can It No matter how far I go  --  <p> and as vividly as a cybervision I see the farm where the cloth was produced , a boundless sea of cotton in southern China .

Piped music tinkles in my ears . <p> After we get somewhere safe  --  <p> " I know it 's sort of weird to say this after three years . " I 'll smile .

I couldn't 've been , the Fates could n't have lied to me , not them and the giant and the Greek cook  --  they told me he was all right , he was good , and I was looking for danger in all the wrong  --  <p> Christ . <p> Jon . Half-lying on an elegant sofa with a gaping rip out of which the stuffing flows in a shiny , fused waterfall . Blood trickles from his nose , and from an awful wound on his torso which he has tried to stanch by knotting his shirt around his ribs . Melchisedec P. Assad sprawls beside the sofa , dead as a doornail if not having much head left is anything to go by , and there probably is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I do n't care , and I try to take Ion in my arms . But he goes as white as paper , and I jerk back . I bury my face in my hands , struggling to keep control . <p> " Hhhhh  --  darling  --  " His hand hits my back . He 's trying to comfort me . " Get out . They 're still here . They 're ransacking the place  --  " <p> " The Vanuwes . They came . " Too late  --  <p> " Not them . Bounty hunters in their pay . Never thought  --  " he smiles on one side of his face  --  " never thought I 'd rank higher on a bounty hunter 's wish list than a man like Melchisedec " He shuts his teeth , breasting a swell of pain . " But they killed him . " <p> " Wait . Bounty hunters  --  how 'd they get in ? What ' bout security ? " <p> " Disguised themselves as parts of Legend . Melchisedec was too trusting . Left himself wide open to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I lured them here . I caused his death . " He pushes me . " Get out , Xiao  --  " <p> I 'm about to tell him I love him , and hold on , tell him to hold on , because even if he ca n't move security 's got ta figure out what 's happening and if we can just stay alive for the next few minutes . . . when I hear a table being shoved over behind me and someone says in a harsh American accent , " Fuck-all in the east wing , Marge . Marge ! Where you at ? " <p> " Hush , King . Hush . Quite a nice little haul I have here . " And a giant chicken , two meters tall , strides with its head bobbing into my line of sight . First off it does n't see me . The woman inside the the holosuit must be counting bills or jewels . Then the chicken windmills backward , startled , and a laser pokes out of its chest feathers like a broken metal rib . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hands . I 'm going to shoot you , but first , who are you ? Is there anyone else ? Is security alerted ? " <p> I think about throwing myself at her . But somewhere among the potted plants and furniture , there is the other one . And I do n't kid myself I 'm faster than a laserbeam . I raise my hands . <p> " I 'll do anything you want ! " Jon chokes with an urgency that makes tears spring to my eyes . " Do n't hurt her ! Please ! Anything ! " <p> The muzzle swings . Laughter crackles inside the chicken , as if it is grinding rocks in its craw . It 's a damn good illusion , right down to the beady eyes darting between us , as if we are tasty insects it ca n't choose between . " Mmm ! Shall you tell us where your novel is hidden , then ? You told us you 'd die rather than see it destroyed . Changed your mind ? We know that is the thing most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's in the medicine compartment over the bathtub in the north wash room . " Jon has my hand . He 's rubbing it as if to keep me real . <p> A polar bear even bigger than the chicken , so big its head flickers in the ceiling , waddles straight through the sofa . The weight of the man inside the illusion dents the seat beside me as he scrambles invisibly over the back of the sofa . " Love it , Marge , " he says as he passes her , heading for the north wing , for Jon 's novel . " Beautiful . The high-minded little prick . He deserves it . " <p> Marge laughs , but the silver mouth of the laser does n't waver again until the bear returns with the heap of flutteringpages . Then , still staring at us with the chicken 's face , Marge aims upward and incinerates the pages fifty at a time as the bear tosses them at the ceiling . I dig my nails into Jon 's palm . I sense that he ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he ca n't take his eyes off it , the same way I could n't take my eyes off Nightmare as she told me my secrets . His face is a mask . Blood is dripping from his nose into his mouth , but he does n't seem to notice . <p> " All right , girl . " The chicken pecks at my face . I feel nothing , of course , but I press back into the gaping rip in the sofa . Marge lets out her gravelly laugh . " Gon na get along okay without your little punk geisha till we reach Boston , Carneira ? " <p> The man inside the bear pulls me upright . <p> " You 'll skanking well have to , that 's all . " <p> White flickering fur envelops me . I wonder how long it 's going to take to die . Time seems to stretch as Marge levels her laser . I am back in the cotton sea , squinting in the white southern heat the bolls are like whorls of light in my hand ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnoticed by the metal orangutans in the distance , gripping my picking sack . . . <p> And the cotton fragments in a shower of broken glass and laserbeams coming from the elevators . Real sun pours in through a smashed wall . Heavy , with jags in it , like half-frozen orange concentrate . I think at first I am dead ; then I realize it is security , arriving too late to save Assad or Jon 's novel land why am I thinking of Jon 's novel when I am standing like a block of wood in the middle of the crossfire , dying ? ) . Too late . The bear and chicken spasm jerkily , like flickering , perforated ghosts with gnarled cyborgs for cores , and I hear shouting , and something sears the back of my neck . <p> It 's all over . They let us go , reluctantly  --  they wanted live criminals , not dead ones . But eventually they realized that because of the evidence , they could n't make a legit case for us having killed Assad , Thank God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still think about him sometimes . When I look at someone dying , for example , and try to remember why people were ever created . <p> Once the officials of Rat World get their claws into you , they never let go . We 're on our way back to China . Just two more deportees , shipped from Legend through Saudarabia to Kabul , Afghanistan . Jon spent three months in the hospital there  --  Security stitched him up on the scene , but he needed some serious recuperation . I helped out with the kids at the holding point so I could stick around , too , and wait for him . <p> Now we 're in a slow carrier to Beijing . <p> I rest my head in Jon 's lap , making the best of the space we have on the cold metal floor . There 's only so much room , cause the carrier was stripped down years ago , and by mutual consent , families with children get the most space . Young people like us make up most of the deportees . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuzzy-headed kid tumbles over my feet ; I grin at it to distract it from crying , and pull up my knees so it can get past , tilting them sideways against our Government-issue duffel . Jon strokes my cheek , gazing into the dark heights of the carrier . He has a faint smile on his lips . " What are you thinking about ? " I ask . <p> The smile broadens . " Being here . With you . " <p> " I still think you were stupid to come , " I say severely . " You 're not an NPRC citizen . Nobody was making you . Eritrea police would 've filed your grievance against the Vanuwes . You would 've got your revenge . Damages enough to live on for the rest of your life . Stead you chose this . " <p> He smiles , shaking his head . " The Vanuwes are n't the kind of people who 'd be put off by a grievance . " <p> I break into a grin . " Jo-on . I wanted you to say it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' <p> " Yes . " <p> He bends down and kisses me . A man nearby smiles tiredly at us . <p> All around , depressed , vacant , resigned faces . I know the story : life savings wasted , nothing but taunts and penalties to look forward to at home . But you have to hold onto something . You have to make some gesture so you can hold up your head . " Why did n't you at least file a grievance ? " <p> He shrugs half shyly . " When that laserbeam went through me , I knew revenge did n't mean anything . It never did . That was the turning point . I used to lie awake asking myself what I 'd do in different situations ; the novel or this , the novel or that . But after death looked at me out of a laser muzzle , all my choices were easy . " <p> " I 'm gon na hold a memorial service for Mother when we get back , " I say . " They 'll have recycled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Jon nods . " Good . " <p> Embarrassed , I look away . The young mother bounces her toddler up and down , singing to it under her breath . It grins across its face . One pearly tooth . " Cute little morsel , " I say . <p> " Cute little morsel yourself . " Jon fingers the place where my rat-tail was seared off . <p> " Do n't , " I say , grabbing his hand , unable to stop myself from squeezing until it must hurt . " That tickles ! " <p> He brings my hand up and kisses it . I shut my eyes , almost overwhelmed by love . <p> And the carrier roars ponderously on . I can tell from the noise we 're low in the airway ; wallowing in the slipstream of exhaust pissed out by the westbound traffic , Japanese , Korean , Siberian cars and the limos of the NPRC ratfaces who feed off our blood , flying to Legend , or even to America . <p> <p> By Felicity Savage <p> Since Felicity Savage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 92/93 , she has become one of our most popular new writers .
