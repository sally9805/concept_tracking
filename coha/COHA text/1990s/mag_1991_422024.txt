<p> We hear a lot about preservation-versus-use arguments over Brazil 's best-known ecosystem , the rain forest . Last year , the staff of DEC 's office of public affairs bad a close-up view of bow Brazilians are working to preserve another of their many major ecosystems , the cerrado , and grappling with other complex environmental issues in their huge country . Silvia Czapski , a journalist and environmental communicator from the city of Itu in Sao Paolo State , Brazil , spent a month working with the bureau of publications . The following story , written during her stay in New York , is her first person account of Brazil 's environmental awakening . At home , Silvia directs communications and public relations for the citizen environmental group , Associacion Ituana de Protecao Ambiental ( Itu 's Association for Environmental Protection , or AIPA ) . She edits the group 's monthly newsletter , Urtiga , is a member of Sao Paulo State 's Council for Environment ( Conselho Estadual de Meio Ambiente ) , and represents AIPA on a forum planning environmental groups ' participation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Development , scheduled for 1992 in Brazil . <p> " Why do n't we try a balloon to take aerial photos of the protected area in Itu ? It must be cheaper than renting a helicopter or special airplane . And you know , satellite information is very far from our reality ... " <p> These were the first words I heard from Rinaldo Orlandi , on a warm Brazilian May Day in 1988 . A forestry engineer and specialist in environmental planning , he had joined our grassroots organization in the effort to maintain one of Sao Paulo State 's last areas of cerrado ( Brazilian savannas - pronounced se-ha ' - do ) as a reserve protected by law . He knew some technicians who were seeking cheaper ways to update environmental data . If we got the balloon , they would work as volunteers . <p> " If you take a 15-year-old map from a European country , and it tells that at point X you 'll find a tree , or a church , you are going to find it . In Brazil , even 10 years later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that tree , you can find a new-built town or a big sugarcane plantation . Things develop too fast in our country , we really need to renew our information , " he insisted . <p> " OK , " I answered , " let 's try to sell the idea to people who can get money for it . But my condition is : I want to fly in that balloon . " <p> We thought that the idea of using a primitive balloon to modernize environmental data might seem odd to others , but we were completely wrong . The directors of our grassroots organization AIPA became enthusiastic . They talked to the owners of a well-planned residential subdivision in the region , who decided to sponsor our proposal . They also had a condition : one of the balloon 's flights should cover their land . <p> I called Orlandi : " We 've got it . " But there was no time for celebrations . We were already in the best time of the year for balloon flights ( not so hot and not windy ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Itu ( pronounced e-too ' ) is a historic town of 150,000 inhabitants . Located just 60 miles from Sao Paulo City , the huge state capital with 17 million inhabitants in its metropolitan area , Itu attracts many tourists . Ituanos are very proud of their historic sites , but for many , environmental problems seem distant , in every sense of the term  --  Itu is situated about 2,000 miles south of the Amazon rainforest with its well-publicized conservation problems . <p> The story of how Ituanos began to fight for the conservation of the cerrado is one of a gradual awakening to the need to protect the last piece of land with the primitive characteristics of their region . Out of the small beginnings of a desire to protect local wildlife grew a battle for nature conservation . <p> In 1985 , some local farmers noticed that the wildlife of their cerrado was decreasing . Deer , capibara ( the biggest rodent ) , crested cariama ( a large bird similar to an ostrich ) and other native animals were seen less often . The farmers invited a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back the wildlife . <p> Dr. Ladislau Deutsch , the former director of Sao Paulo Zoo , gave the answer : animals were vanishing because their habitat was being destroyed . <p> It was true . In the last two decades , many new people were moving to Itu . Land was being subdivided , new houses were built where before one could find the typical bushes of the cerrado . Bringing Back the Cerrado <p> Dr. Deutsch suggested two choices for bringing back the wildlife : Breed some species and then set them free . To do this , it would be necessary to put a fence around the area to protect the animals , and to provide them special food to maintain the natural balance between original vegetation and animals already existing there . Restore the original vegetation , allowing the now-rare wild animals to multiply naturally . For that , a large number of local citizens would have to join a protectionist action . <p> The farmers ' reaction was immediate : even knowing that it would take longer and be more difficult in the beginning , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get more citizens involved , they formed AIPA . They decided to fight first for legal protection for a piece of cerrado owned by the state ( which should be transformed into a wilderness area ) and also for their farms ( which should become a restricted use area , a green belt for the cerrado . <p> It took some weeks to get an appointment with Itu 's mayor and local legislators . But when they got it , the answer was surprisingly good  --  in the beginning of 1986 , the law was promulgated . <p> Two characteristics of this law attracted nationwide attention : In Brazil , a special protected reserve is usually created by federal or state law , but the cerrado reserve in Itu was born through a municipal law and by request of local community ; The law includes the zoning of the protected area , determining where and what kind of activity can be done on each piece of land . In Brazil , usually these regulations come later on as a complement to the law . Restoring Life <p> Getting the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blowing wind at a windmill  --  they wanted to do more and more . But before starting restoration , they had to know what remained o f native life in the now-protected cerrado . They also wanted to have more Ituanos in the organization . Fortune helped them at that moment . <p> Early in 1986 , the Brazilian Congress approved a law authorizing tax deductible donations by businesses to cultural and environmental projects . The small AIPA  --  our grassroots organization  --  was the first group to receive the designation of " cultural organization " from the country 's ministry of culture . This enabled the association to get these tax deductible grants . <p> With this funding , some dreams could be transformed into reality . In 1987 , 11 scientists came to Itu 's cerrado to study its flora and fauna in all four seasons . They identified 187 species of vertebrates and hundreds of plant species . A nature photographer came with them . With his camera , he captured beautiful scenes from the life of the cerrado , whose bushes , at first view , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small flowers , strange forms of tree trunks , wild animals and hard-skinned fruits became precious educational material for AIPA . <p> The photos enlivened association members ' speeches to local organizations , schools and national meetings . The next year , they inspired a traveling exhibit which was shown in 17 towns of Sao Paulo State , and also at the National Congress , in Brasilia , the country 's capital . In all these places , local groups were invited to join the exhibit , presenting their work . <p> The hard economic situation in Brazil made it difficult to raise funding . More than half of AIPA 's activities continued to be done by volunteers . One good example of a volunteer activity is a pilot project to restore original cerrado vegetation in a damaged area two hectares ( about five acres ) in size . Technicians from two state agencies planned and carried out the project . Another state agency provided the right species of tree seedlings and , what is very rare in Brazil , soldiers from Itu 's army regiment did the planting work as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AIPA from the beginning , but it was not until 1987 that I got professionally involved . I was convinced that it was possible to use my technical knowledge as a journalist to help spread the love of natural life . And so I proposed Urtiga ( stinging nettle ) an eight-page monthly newsletter which discusses local environmental problems . Urtiga is a free supplement in all local newspapers . But it is also mailed to AIPA 's members , specialized journalists and environmental organizations . <p> Urtiga reflects the organization 's way of working , so it tries not to just denounce problems . It focuses on solutions , and on showing how local citizens can act to help environmental protection . Like other grassroots environmental organizations in historical towns , we link historical preservation to natural ecosystems protection . Once , we published an article written by a member about an abandoned theatre in Itu , the first theatre in Sao Paulo State . This article inspired a movement which is trying to raise grants for the restoration of that building . Beyond An Exclusive <p> When Rinaldo Orlandi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought what a good exclusive story it would be for the newsletter . but I knew that in this it would be better for AIPA to have widespread information about the experience and its results . In the few weeks we had to prepare for the flights , I called the local papers and nationwide TV channels . <p> By July , we were ready . And the morning we planned for the first flights was one of the most beautiful days in that season . Three TV channels and some newspaper reporters came . Like everybody else , I was anxiously looking at the last preparations . Would it work ? The only thing I was sure of was that I would not get my flight in that balloon until the last day , to allow for the technicians ' work . <p> " It 's great to film from here . There are no vibrations like I would have with a helicopter . And no windows to cut my view , or noise to interfere ! " one of the technicians described to us through a radio from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is good to photograph the details . But it also gets high enough to do what we need , " said the other technician when they came down . Everybody 's apprehension turned into satisfaction . <p> The problems arose the next day . " Too much wind . We ca n't fly , " announced the balloon 's pilot . <p> We could n't believe it . To us , it did not seem so windy . But in the five days , with two flights scheduled each day , the balloon went up only five times . If we had had to pay the time the technicians stayed at Itu awaiting the opportunity to fly , it would have cost as much as renting an airplane . <p> On the other hand , it was beautiful to see the balloon from earth and also to see the region from the balloon . And the photographs from balloon flights became the subject of a presentation in a scientific conference some months later . After the Balloon <p> AIPA was becoming known in Brazil . Several grassroots organizations from other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice , exchange experiences . We held a meeting of all the groups to find out the best ways to work . To prepare the meeting , five nongovernmental groups from different cities in Sao Paulo State formed the " green network " ( rede verde ) . The central question , which attracted more than 200 representatives , was : " What do we want from government , from community and from ourselves ? " <p> Last year the law which allowed tax deductible donations for organizations like AIPA ended . It was easy to continue with the newsletter , by carrying advertising . Some volunteer work . such as lobbying town assemblymen , goes on , too . But other projects are progressing too slowly : a recycling program in a part of the city ( Brazil is just beginning with this kind of experience ) , scientific research and , especially , a native species nursery are waiting for support . Even so , the members are not discouraged . They are working a lot where they can . <p> An important part of my work for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was an excellent chance to see how American people deal with environmental issues , sometimes very similar , sometimes so different . It is important to me to get into different realities , to find new ideas and  --  why not ?  --  more stories for Urtiga . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Over a four-season period , this group of researchers studied the animal and vegetable life of the protected cerrado at Itu . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The author displays a poster of Brazilian flora and fauna . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : A blue-green collibri , one the five species found in Itu 's protected area . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Protection of natural habitat is vital for maintaining native species such as this frog ( Hyla faber ) . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Green like the leaves , brown like the soil , this lizard ( Ameiva ameiva ) moves swiftly . <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : Two views of the cerrado  --  It appears to be a desert , but it really is the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clay beneath .

It is a concept that has attracted enthusiasm and hope in an area often characterised by disillusion and defeat . The interest in recovery arose from the experiences of people with severe mental health problems . Since then professional bodies , health care agencies and governments have become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental health policy , practice and services . <p> In mental health services recovery has three main meanings : a spontaneous and natural event  --  overcoming problems without intervention , the intended consequence of the skilful use of the full range of effective treatments , and finally personal recovery that can occur in the context of continuing symptoms or disabilities . <p> The first usage relates to resilience and robustness and is poorly understood ; the second is the focus of evidence-based practice and treatment guidelines ; and the third is about recovery of hope and ambition for living full and purposeful lives whatever the circumstances . It is this definition that is informing some current thinking on direction in mental health services . <p> L : EVIDENCE An emphasis on personal recovery focuses on collaboration , partnership working and self-directed care , all of which lead to choice and control for people who use services , their families and other supporters . <p> A recovery approach may be applicable across various client groups and connects with many of the ways in which cultures other than Europeans approach health challenges . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as such , can begin to fuse learning from our current UK population that includes European , Eastern and African views to inform services for the 21st century . <p> Recovery is the process of regaining active control over one 's life . This may involve discovering ( or rediscovering ) a positive sense of self , accepting and coping with the reality of any continuing distress or disability , finding meaning in one 's experiences , resolving personal , social or relationship issues that may contribute to one 's mental health difficulties , taking on satisfying and meaningful social roles , and calling on formal and/or informal systems of support as needed . <p> The need for services will vary . For some people , recovery may mean exiting from mental health services permanently or for much of the time . For others it may mean continuing to receive ongoing forms of medical , personal or social support that enable people to get on with their lives . <p> L : KEY THEMES IN RECOVERY * Recovery is about a set of values related to human living applied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shift of emphasis from pathology , illness and symptoms to health , strengths and wellness . * Hope is of central significance . If recovery is about one thing it is about the recovery of hope , without which it may not be possible to recover . That hope can arise from many sources , including being believed and believed in , and the example of peers . * Recovery involves a process of empowerment to regaining active control over one 's life . This includes developing confidence and taking increasing personal responsibility through effective self-care , self-management and self-directed care . * Finding meaning in and valuing personal experience can be important , as is faith including religious or secular spirituality. * Recovery approaches are positive about cultural , religious , sexual and other forms of diversity as sources of identity and belonging . * Recovery is supported by resolving personal , social or relationship problems and both understanding and realistically coming to terms with ongoing illness or disability . * Recovery is associated with social inclusion and being able to take on meaningful and satisfying social roles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , adequate personal finances , education and leisure facilities . * There is a pivotal need to discover ( or rediscover ) a positive sense of personal identity , separate from illness and disability . * The language used and the stories and meanings that are constructed around personal experience , conveyed in letters , reports and conversations , have significance as mediators of recovery processes . These shared meanings either support a sense of hope or carry an additional weight of morbidity , inviting pessimism and chronic illness . * Treatment is important but its capacity to support recovery lies in the opportunity to arrive at treatment decisions through negotiation and collaboration . * Recovery-based services emphasise the personal qualities of staff as much as their formal qualifications , and seeks to cultivate their capacity for hope , creativity , care and compassion , acceptance and resilience. * To support personal recovery , services need to move beyond preoccupations with risk avoidance and a narrow interpretation of evidence-based approaches towards working with creative risk-taking and what is meaningful to the individual and their family .
