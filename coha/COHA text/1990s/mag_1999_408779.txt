Recent fiction , essays , and self-help books ( Dumped ! , for one ) suggest that a harsh new mating system is emerging // WOMEN 'S tastes in popular reading have long favored two kinds of romances . One is the romance of failing in love and making a brilliant marriage . This centuries-old staple traces the progress of true love from wooing to wedding , through all the confusions and complications along the way . The other is more contemporary and appears prominently in women 's magazines , especially those aimed at educated women in the Baby Boom generation . It is the romance of finding a job and making a brilliant career . Here the progress is from first job to first six-figure salary . Complications arise in this narrative as well , but it ends happily with the acquisition of an executive title , a great wardrobe , and a bicoastal social life . What the two romances have in common is the optimistic and essentially liberal faith that a young woman can get what she wants through the shrewd exercise of her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , a vastly different kind of popular literature is emerging . It is written for and about the privileged members of a new generation . These young women , the highly educated daughters of educated Baby Boomers , are in their twenties and thirties , living and working on their own . Compared with earlier generations , they spend a long time in the mating market , and thus face prolonged exposure to the vicissitudes of love , including multiple breakups , fears of sexually transmitted disease , and infertility anxieties . They must also go through a prolonged period of higher education and career apprenticeship in order to establish themselves in a demanding job market . During these years they may be laid off , downsized , or fired at least once or twice . Neither their love life nor their work life is settled or secure . The new literature reflects these dual realities . Like traditional women 's stories , it deals with themes of love and work , often interweaving the two , but it breaks sharply with the romantic view of both . The defining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or landing the great job but precisely the opposite . It 's getting dumpedby a boyfriend or a boss or both . What 's more , these books challenge get what she wants . THE purest statement of the signature theme in this literature can be found in a batch of self-help books published over the past few years , with titles such as Dumped ! ; He Loved Me , He Loves Me Not ; The Heartbreak Handbook ; Getting Over Him ; Exorcising Your Ex ; How to Heal the Hurt by Hating ; and The Woman 's Book of Revenge . There is also a Complete Idiot @ Guide to Handling a Breakup . But this theme is not limited to self-help literature . It crosses over into other genres . Suzanne Yalof 's Getting Over John Doe is a minimemoir . Candace Bushnell 's Sex and the City is a collection of her columns in the New York Observer . Perhaps the most thorough treatment of the theme is found in recent coming-of-age fiction such as Melissa Bank 's critically acclaimed The Girls ' Guide to Hunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kate Christensen 's In the Drink , and Laura Zigman 's Animal Husbandry . Like Jane Austen 's Emma , the young women in these four books are handsome , clever , and rich in educational advantage ( a good education is the contemporary equivalent of propertied wealth ) . After graduating from elite colleges they move to Manhattan , find minuscule apartments , and seek their fortunes . Eventually they land jobs in the glamorous media or entertainment industry . But their jobs are lowlevel and short-term ; they are temps , parttimers , and freelancers . What 's more , their employment prospects do n't improve as time goes on : instead of moving up the career ladder , they get stuck at the level of the temp job . Far from making brilliant careers , they forever remain Girl Fridays . Their love lives are n't much more successful . They go out with attractive , highprofile men , but these men are not looking for a lifelong mate-they 're already encumbered by a wife or a live-in girlfriend , or they have weird habits ( wearing mouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Far from making brilliant marriages , these smart , funny , talented women forever remain girlfriends or ex-girlfriends . Consider Claudia Steiner , the twentynine-year-old protagonist of In the Drink . A Swarthmore graduate , she has spent nine post-college years in New York City in low-level jobs ( receptionist , dog walker , phone-sex scriptwriter , temp , waitress , housecleaner , and temp again ) when she lands an $18-an-hour position as a personal assistant to and ghostwriter for a celebrity author of mystery romances . Her boss , Jackie del Castellano , turns out to be egotistical and tyrannical ; she insists on pretending that Claudia , who is turning Jackie 's literary straw into bestselling gold , is merely providing a fresh insight or two . What 's more , Jackie routinely yells at , humiliates , and mistreats Claudia , and finally dumps her . Claudia 's home life is n't much better . She lives alone in a " rathole on an airshaft , " eats takeout , and drinks too much . She says , " I was like a tiny version of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of corruption and neglect . " And her love life is a mess . Although she is desperately in love with William , her childhood friend , she ca n't find the " bridge between friendship and romance . " Instead she falls into and out of relationships that follow a predictable course : " bantering dive-bar pickup , drunken sex , a rushed exchange of phone numbers afterwards on a subway platform , then other nights with more dive-bar bantering and drunken sex . " Bosses and boyfriends behave a lot alike in the novels . They make nice to you ( ever so briefly ) . Then they dump you . The bosses are invariably vain , capricious , self-centered , and hard-shelled women , not mentors but tormentors . In The Girls ' Guide to Hunting and Fishing , Jane Rosenal is a rising star in her publishing company until Mimi Howlett , her new boss , arrives . Mimi demotes Jane from the promising position of associate book editor to de facto personal assistant . She also relentlessly criticizes Jane 's professional work while generously offering her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from bad to worse following a firing . After Ariel Steiner , the protagonist in Run Catch Kiss , is dumped from her freelance job as a sex columnist and from her temp job in a Manhattan publishing company , she slides from a temp job in a bank in Queens to a part-time job in Brooklyn before hitting bottom with a waitressing job at a twelve-table restaurant in the Village . ( Her salary plummets from a high of $18 an hour to a low of $5.50 an hour plus tips . ) Jane Rosenal languishes as a temp worker in a bank . Boyfriends look good on paperthey 're a mostly upscale crowd of writers , publishers , artists , fund managers , and investment bankers-but they turn out to be cruel , careless , self-absorbed , socially clueless , and sexually inept . What 's more , as prospective mates they 're virtually indistinguishable . In the traditional romance there was one special guy for every special girl . The special girl found her special guy by administering a set of means and morals tests and then using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pack . Dump literature rejects this premise . It takes the opposing view-that men are all the same . " I 've gone out with the short , fat , and ugly , " says a woman journalist in Sex and the City , " and it does n't make any difference . They 're just as unappreciative and self-centered as the goodlooking ones . " In short , the existence of many men does n't guarantee the existence of many choices . There 's just One Guy . Take him or leave him . More precisely , take him and he 'll leave you . WHEN it comes to ending a relationship , male behavior is entirely predictable . According to dump literature , it 's over when he says ( pick one ) : a ) " I think maybe we should cool things for a while , " b ) " I 've been doing a lot of thinking , " c ) " God , this week is going to be terrible ... I 'm completely swamped , " or d ) " It 's not you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ex-girlfriends and ex-Girl Fridays do n't get downhearted . They get even . In these books the functional equivalent of romantic passion is revenge , served up fast and hot . The self-help books reject the therapeutic approach of grieving over a loss , which was popular in an earlier generation of books aimed mainly at divorcing couples . The best therapy , many of them advise , is to work through your grief on his property . Since many contemporary breakups involve a household as well as a relationship , the revenge schemes focus on destroying or defacing his stuff , including his car and clothing . Some of this is intended as mere fantasy , or played for laughs . But some scenarios recur so frequently-obsessively calling his answering machine and driving past his place , shredding his pictures or clothes , getting mutual friends to spy on him-that it is hard not to assume that they have been battle-tested . For the characters in the novels , writing is the best revenge . As one observes , " It 's the ultimate revenge fantasy . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obsessed with . " In Run Catch Kiss , Ariel Steiner takes revenge on the disgusting men she goes out with by lampooning them in her popular sex column . After her boyfriend dumps her , Jane Goodall , the protagonist in Animal Husbandry , turns to animal research for evidence on why men flee . She invents a theory based on the observation that a bull will ditch an old cow as soon as a new cow appears , and then gets a job writing about her " Old-Cow-NewCow " theory as a pseudonymous science columnist for a men 's magazine . Bosses are likewise targets for revenge . In a twist on the writing-as-revenge tactic , Claudia Steiner strikes back by unwriting : she erases the disk containing the text of her boss 's nearly completed book . Revenge is psychologically expedient , but it does not accomplish lasting personal transformation , much less social change . What is striking is how little this literature protests the cycle of temping and dumping and how little hope it holds out for an end to it . This is all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by all the advantages that education , fond parents , and a good therapist can provide . Nevertheless , the challenge for these women is not to avoid , let alone alter , the bleak disjunctions of life but merely to survive themto get over them and move on . In a world so blindly indifferent to individual merit and mettle a woman 's chief psychological resource is humor , and her only form of activism is to laugh it off and get back in the game . Despite its resignation , this literature is hardly weary or despondent . It is full of riffs , spoofs , quips , and mordant observations about men , women , and their mating and relating problems . The most appealing element of this humor is not its acidulous portrait of men and bosses but its unsparing view of women 's weaknesses and self-deceptions . " I could n't get enough of the most unsuitable men , " one character says . Another explains why she and her female boss were attracted to each other : " She was desperate , and I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the hilarity . After all , what is funny at twenty-five might be less so at thirty-five . Some of the characters are haunted by a vision of themselves in the future , living alone in a dark studio apartment , eating out of an open refrigerator , and earning a meager wage stuffing envelopes at home . And although the fiction resorts to the expedient of the happy ending , the girl-gets-guy resolutions that some employ are thoroughly unconvincing and entirely at odds with everything that has come before . Of course , no one believes that dump literature offers a documentary portrait of today 's educated young women . In its depiction of work it draws heavily on the experience of the authors ( themselves young ) , who , like aspiring actors , may have taken part-time or temp jobs in order to devote themselves more fully to their craft . Theirs is a very narrow slice of work life , hardly representative of the experience of the many post-college single women who enjoy far greater success in their careers than these fictional characters . Nor can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Few young women spend every night at clubs or have sex , drunken or otherwise , with a string of partners . What does ring true , however , is the depiction of what might be called the plight of the high-status woman . GIVEN the high divorce rate , today 's young women can not rely on marriage for economic security . Even if they aspire to marriage ( and according to survey research , most do ) , they have to be ready and able to support themselves with their own earnings . This has meant everincreasing education beyond high school . For women pursuing high-status professions the schooling can extend several years beyond college , well into their twenties . Then , for as much as another decade , such women must invest heavily in developing their careers . Indeed , women on the make adopt the same priorities as men on the make . Work is in the foreground , love in the middle distance or the background . Neither men nor women have the time or a pressing desire for marriage , especially when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it off and enter into relationships that offer some combination of sex , companionship , convenience , and economies of scale . By the time high-status single men and women reach their early thirties , however , their marriage prospects begin to diverge . Men 's educational and career achievements enhance their marriageability and increase the pool of prospective mates , because men tend to marry women of similar or lesser education , and the supply at or below their achievement level is large . For women of the same age and education the opposite is the case : high-status women tend to seek husbands of higher levels of education and achievement , and their lofty status decreases the pool of eligible mates . For men , age is no barrier to attracting women . A few gray hairs can be sexy . For women , age is no asset . A few gray hairs can send a woman racing to the colorist . Moreover , intragender competition can be fierce . High-status women find themselves in competition not only with other high-status women but also with younger women of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is thirtyish female physicians who , having finished their rigorous training , are ready for marriage . They find themselves up against slightly younger residents and interns along with a large pool of twentysomething nurses and other health professionals . Since the nurses and the physical therapists are in careers that can be disrupted and then picked up again , they may be more willing than the female physicians to stay home and raise children while their husbands pursue careers . This , too , can be a source of competitive disadvantage for the female physicians . By this stage in life single women of talent and accomplishment begin to grasp the principle that life is unfair in at least one key domain . Men may be able to pursue their careers singlemindedly during their twenties and postpone marriage until their thirties without compromising their fertility or opportunities to find a suitable mate , but women can not . Just at the moment when they are ready to slow down and share the pleasures of life with similarly successful mates , they look around and find that many of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an odd assortment : married men who want a girlfriend on the side ; divorced men with serious financial , childcustody , or ex-wife problems ; and single men who invite suspicion simply because they 're still single . These mating patterns lead to a plaint familiar among upscale single women in their thirties : " There are no good men left . " Thus the career strategy now favored by well-educated young women , in part to establish their own economic viability as a cushion against the likelihood of an eventual divorce , exacts a maddening cost of its own : it makes it less likely that they will marry in the first place . This is a classic case of what is known as goods in conflict . Taken separately , most of the dump books can be read as entertainments ; taken together , however , they suggest that an important and recent change is occurring in the lives of educated young women . The romance of love and marriage took its inspiration from a long-standing mating system , but the defining institutions of the old system are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decline . A new mating system is emerging , with its own complications and confusions , including the conflict that faces high-status women . These books are field reports on the new rules of engagementand disengagement . <p>
