What lies ahead for Robert Reed The following story should discourage anyone from making such predictions , but we 'll wager that Mr. Reed 's next book will be a collection of short stories entitled The Dragons of Spngplace . Perhaps it will even be published this April or May . But who can really say for sure ? <p> E WENT TO SCHOOL together . Kindergarten right up through high school . But Marv and me were never what you 'd call good buddies . In grade school and junior high , I bet we did n't say ten words to each other . In high school , Marv was in one of my gym classes , and because of our last names  --  Donner and Dubrook - we were stuck in the same homeroom . And yeah , sure , our senior year we shared a locker . And that 's it . That 's all . Even considering how things are going now , that 's all there is to tell . To me , Marvin Donner was this scruffy little blond twit who always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who said , " Cool , " and , " Neat , " while grinning way too much . The twit loved to smoke that ditch weed . From junior high on , he was our official class doper . The best thing I remember about him is that when we were locker mates , he kept telling me , " Do n't look behind my books , Steve . Okay ? And if you 've got to look , do n't take any more than you really need . " " Okay , Marv , " I would tell him . " Cool . Neat . Thanks . " Despite what you hear , a lot of us kids managed to stay sober and clear-headed in the " 70s . The occasional beer was it for me . I was this upstanding boy trying to hang out with the college-prep crowd . While Marv Donner was stuck in some blue-collar , pot-haze track . Shop classes and bonehead English , I 'm guessing . He was already playing the guitar . But back then , every guy tried playing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers . Marv used to sit outside at lunch , strumming hard and singing little songs that he must have written himself . Must have , because I did n't recognize any of them . And because they were n't very good . I can sort of remember their cheery noise and his scratchy little-kid voice and how he would strum and pick until something sounded absolutely awful . Then he would stop the show and twist the knobs , telling stupid jokes while trying to fix what could be fixed . Singing and pot . Marv 's life in the shell of a nut . During my last semester , I had an early geometry class . One morning , about a week before graduation , I got to school late . One of the counselors was waiting at my locker . Ms. Vitovsky was this chunky little woman who took everything seriously . She said , " Steve , " with a voice that made me hold my breath . She said , " I have awful news . " Then she gathered herself before telling me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It took me a few seconds to put Marv and Marvin together . I blinked and straight away , I asked , " Is he dead ? " Miss Vitovsky gave me a brave little smile , then said , " No . But he 's badly hurt . " Because she thought I needed it , she put a hand on my shoulder . Then she told me , " His car hit a light pole . He 's in intensive care . At General , if you want to visit him . " What I was thinking about was that I was late for class . I shook my head and admitted , " You know , I barely know the guy . " " Really ? I thought you were good friends . " I wrestled open my locker . Man 's books were on the top shelf , their plasticized covers looking new . That 's how much he needed books . On the spur of the moment , I reached up and peeked behind them . Nothing there . " I 've seen you talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why she had mistaken us for friends . I grabbed my books , slammed the locker , then told her , " Sorry . " " By any chance then ... do you know who his friends are ... ? " Again , " Sorry . " " Well , " she had to tell me , " Marvin is going to pull through . " She touched me on the elbow . I can remember the squeeze of her fingers and her eyes looking damp , and I remember her voice breaking as she said , " If anyone asks , tell them . Tell them that he should make a full recovery . Would you do that , please ? " Our fallen comrade did n't make it to graduation , naturally . But Marv got himself mentioned . Our principal publicly wished him well . Which caused our valedictorian to do the same in her long , boring speech . Using their best Cheech and Chong voices , my classmates repeated a string of bad pothead jokes . And I made some little comment about driving into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all it takes , " I asked , " why do n't we all do it ? " Summer was busy , and boring . I spent it stocking and clerking at my father 's little grocery store , saving up my money and having zero time for socializing . I went to City College in the fall and found myself in a new circle of friends . Around Christmas , I bumped into one of my old circle . Both of us were out shopping . We spent most of our breath promising that we 'd get together soon . Lying , in other words . Then the guy told me , in passing , " I hear Marv got out of the hospital . Finally . He 's living at home again . " I had n't thought about my lockermate for months , nearly . But I said , " Yeah , that 's great to hear . " As if I already knew it . As if I 'd spent my nights worrying . Four more years slipped past without Marvin Donner . I met this beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And while that was happening , I started screwing her best friend , Molly . Which was n't the smartest trick . Then after both girls dumped me , I met Cathy , who was pretty enough , and fun enough , and we were married just before our senior year . I graduated from City College with a degree in business . My father hired me . Bribed me . Whichever . Maybe it was n't smart to return to the grocery . But Cathy was pregnant - with twins , we found out - and she had a talent for spending everything we had . That 's why I took over managing the store , working some bruising hours . Early one morning , driving to work , I heard this odd song that just kept going and going . It was pretty enough , I guess . And the refrain sounded like it belonged on the radio . Light and fun , and all that . " What might be , should be , will be , " it went . Then , " Will be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished . The disc jockey put it to bed after five minutes or so . " ' Will Be " is the title , " he announced . " By a local talent . Marvin Donner . " I could have rushed over to Musicland and bought the " 45 . I 've met hundreds who did , or at least claim they did . But frankly I 've never been much for pop music . Sometimes , I go for years without even playing any of my Beatles albums . " Will Be " was in the Top Forty for three quick weeks , peaking at 31st before quietly drowning in the disco sea . An old classmate came into the grocery one day . He reported that Marv still looked like the same blond-haired twit . That he was living at home with Mom . Still . And that he was making pretty good money singing at the local clubs . I heard " Will Be " a few times , always on the radio . Usually I was in the Chevy , which had shitty speakers . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on their big cabinet stereo . That was the only time when I really listened to the words , and some of them stuck . " The plague will come in the blood , " stuck . And , " The sandman burns the desert . " Grim bullshit like that , and no wonder it did n't sell better . That 's what I was thinking . Then I heard that line about " The ragged rings of Neptune , " and I was thinking , " Poor Marv . " Saturn is the planet with rings , " I was thinking . And I shook my head , feeling awfully superior to that stupid little doper . Life melted past trying to keep his family happY and afloat . And the . I was this kid just trying to keep his family happy and afloat . And then I was n't the kid anymore . I was living out on the edge of town , in a house with four bedrooms and as many toilets . But the twins were out of college , and the other two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred to me that more than half my life was done , and if changes were going to be made , I needed to make them now . It was a pretty typical divorce . Pissy and bloody , and left unfinished for too long . In the end , Cathygot a fat slice of the grocery . But I found myself being philosophical about the loss . The grocery was my father 's , not mine . And Dad was safely dead , immune to what was happening to his legacy and to me . No , what mattered in my life was me . Finally . I rented this upscale one-bedroom apartment and leased the best sports utility 4X4 that I could afford . Then like millions of brave grayhairs before me , I went out patrolling for willing young women . My third date was a single gal in her twenties . Named Lucee . " The same as Lucy , " she told me , " only different . " Maybe she was n't as pretty as some , and I think she could have misplaced ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she had some wonky beliefs . Before we were done with dinner , I learned all about Chinese herbal treatments and how the Shriners had a role in Kennedy 's assassination . But on the bright side , we ended up back at my apartment and in my bed , and at one point , while I was lying happily on my back , Lucee started humming a familiar little melody . " What 's that song ? " I managed to grunt . She said something that I could n't quite decipher . " The song , " I moaned . Then her mouth was empty , and she said , " Will be , " as if that was enough . As if I should know instantly what she meant . " Will be what ? " I said . " It 's about the future , Steve . Do n't you know the song ? " I had n't thought about " Will Be " in years . Or Marv Donner . That 's why I just lay there , sputtering , " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pulled herself up over me , sex forgotten for things more cosmic and vital . " It 's all they talk about on the Internet , " she informed me . " I ca n't believe you 've never heard of it . " " Will Be " ? Again , she hummed the refrain . " Wait , " I muttered . " ' What might be , should be , will be ... ? " " She grinned and said , " You do know it ! " " Well , sure . I used to hear it on the radio . Back when you were wearing diapers , practically . " That put a light in her eyes . " Really ? " " The singer ... he 's a local guy ... " " He is , " she agreed . I rolled out from under her and looked at those bright eyes . Then I told her the clincher . " You know , I went to school with Marv . We were lockermates . Buddies , even . " Her eyes changed their color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scooted back a bit and shook her head , pointing out , " A minute ago , you did n't know what I was talking about . " Asking me , " Just how gullible do you think I am ? " Lucee taught me the basics that night . The song was obscure for a lot of years , she admitted . But then some music buff in Albany or Indiana was playing the old " 45 , and he realized that certain passages made sense . The sandman who started the fire was Saddam , of course . The poison in the blood was AIDs . And Neptune really had a goofy set of rings . Which was something that I did n't know until that moment . According to the Internet , and my date , a bunch of predictions had already come true . And others looked ready to . And yet . I did n't hear anything more about " Will Be " for several months . Lucee was exaggerating the song 's importance , because even the wonkiest rumors on the Net creep out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I did n't hear anything more about it from Lucee , either . She did n't return any of my calls , and after a week or two , or three , I decided she was too crazy anyway and gave up on her . Out of curiosity , I looked for my old lockermate in the phone book . No Marvin Donners , or MaNs . But it had been a lot of years , and even potheads move away . And besides , your modem prophets usually have a 900 stuck in front of their phone numbers . Those next months were pretty lousy . When I was married , the world seemed filled with young willing women . But after Lucee I plunged into a stale stretch where I was n't meeting anyone , young or otherwise . And where every other part of my life was full of problems , too . The store roof began springing leaks , and my freezers were coming to the end of their natural lives . My assistant manager left me for one of the big chains . And all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping up with the monthly extortion payments . In the middle of everything , I spotted an article in our local paper . Reprinted straight from The New York Times , it talked about an obscure song and all the ludicrous predictions that had come true . Plus those still waiting for the chance . Read his lyrics in the proper . way , wrote the reporter , and the songwriter had successfully predicted every President starting with Reagan . " The chimp 's sidekick , " Marv called him . Bush was , " Texas Yale . " Then there was , " The little rock has busy rocks . " Plus our current Top Dog : " The hero from the flatlands ! " And there were other predictions that became history . " The eye-toldus what to do ! " was the Iranian hostage mess . Three Mile Island was " The Amish meltdown . " The collapse of the Soviet Union had its own full verse , complete with the birthmark and the wall tumbling down and tanks shooting at their White House . Plus there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jove 's pimply child , " was a moon of Jupiter . Apparently . " A man from New York is born twice , " was the billionaire 's clone baby , announced just weeks ago . And " The sun lives inside a bottle of light . " Which was n't a doper 's mutterings . But instead , I learned from the article , was a pretty fair description of the newest fusion reactors . Yet what really impressed me , and sold it for most of the world , was what had n't quite come true . Yet . " After the third day of the third month of the century 's third year , " Marv once sang , " the bear kills a third of everything . " The reporter made the easy guess about the bear 's identity . What 's more , that predicted date arrived a week later , and exactly on cue , our stock market took a wild tumble , hundreds of billions of dollars evaporating in a single horrible day . Economic nightmares have warnings . But usually not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and weeks , what started as crazy electrons on the Internet turned into the only story on the news . Even the stock market took second billing . " Will Be " was the subject of every editorial and a hundred special in-depth reports . The Flatland Hero mentioned the song at his press conference , joking that Mr. Donner was the newest member of his cabinet . And overnight , our little city filled up with cameras and reporters vying for a word with or even a glimpse of our most famous citizen . Oh , yeah . Marv still lived nearby . With Mom , as it turned out . And Mom happened to like a certain fat old reporter who worked at one of the local stations . That 's why he beat out a brigade of Pulitzer winners to get the interview of the century . Of the millennium . Whatever . Expecting history , I watched that show . My first impression was that Marv had n't aged at all . My one-time locker buddy was sitting in the tiny living room of his mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His hair was thinning but blond still , and it was still just as long , tied in a ponytail . But on second glance , I noticed that his face had that sickly wrinkled look that you find in kids who die of old age at fourteen . Normally I would have thought Marv looked silly . Old hippies always do . But knowing what kinds of gifts he had at his beck and call had me thinking , " On him , it looks right . Just like a prophet should be ... ! " The lucky reporter was flustered enough to tremble , and his voice cracked and broke and sometimes stopped altogether . " Where did you ... did you ... think up this wonderful song ... ? " Marv gave him a doper 's vague stare , then with a smoke-roughened voice said , " On my back . When I was in the hospital . There was n't anything to do but look far ahead . " The reporter gulped and said , " Yes ... I see ... " He had n't done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... in the hospital ... ? " " I was n't feeling good . " Then Marv broke into an odd little laugh , something in the eyes either very wise or very empty . " But I got better . I got well . " " Well ... that 's good to hear . " Another gulp , then , " Can you tell me ? How did you look into the future ? " A giggle . Then Marv leaned forward and told him , " Carefully . I did it carefully . " The interview lurched along like that . Stupid questions followed with words that might mean everything , or nothing . Depending on how you heard them . Finally the reporter mustered up his courage , asking , " But what about the future ? Is there anything that is n't in your song - tn " Stop ! " a woman barked . Then a white-haired old gal - his mother , I guessed - came running into the picture , hands raised , screaming , " We warned you ! We are not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her son . Except she was clear-eyed and tough as gravel . With a strength that took everyone by surprise , she shoved the camera out of Marv 's face , telling the world , " It 's over . We 're done ! Leave us alone ! " " D NEVER FOUND TIME or the excuse to make it to any high school reunion . But it seemed important that summer . The economy was still buckling beneath us , and just like the song predicted - " Siberia goes bye-bye " - a civil war was brewing in Russia . With all of these important things happening , the reunion became a kind of duty . A way of elbow-scraping with history . Even when it was announced that your most famous alum would n't attend , I did . All of us did . How else could you come to terms with what was happening ? I ended up in the corner of a packed ballroom , shooting the shit with most of my old circle . The men were fat or balding , or both . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the talkers still liked to talk . And the ones who always knew the gossip at school were the ones pretending to know it all now . " The car crash is what did it , " one fellow assured us . " Marv got a pretty good head injury . Obviously the damage did something to his wiring . " We nodded . Obviously , absolutely . Then another in-the-know said , " He still does n't function too well . I saw him when he was still performing . Remember the Cottonwood House ? His mom had to practically lead him up on stage and back off again . " Then with a wicked little wink , the guy added , " He wears a diaper , too . The way I hear it . " Again , we did our nods . Then I said , " She 's quite a gal , his mom is . " " The way I hear it , " said a woman , " it 's Mom who stole back the rights to his song . Six or seven years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all had a good chuckle about that . " Plus , " said one baldie , " she 's responsible for that deal with their new label . The Donners , I hear , get fifty percent of every sale . " Someone else said , " It 's two hundred million sold now . Worldwide . " A third said , " It 's half a billion , if you count the pirates . " I just nodded and listened , and nodded some more . Then a younger woman-a blonde with fat glasses who had married into the circle  --  asked , " But what does the rest of the song mean ? " She was looking at me , I realized . " What 's Will Be " still got to tell us ? " I did n't have any special clue . But she seemed to expect something out of me , which is why I said , " Westfall 's our next President . " I 'd read it somewhere , and I was n't the only one . " ' A gray-beard leads us into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's got to be the Senator . It 's got to be ! " Then someone else said , " It 's with China , the war is . " As if there was n't any doubt . " ' The crowded man reaches for his island , " " the quoter continued . Then he paused , waiting for everyone 's eyes to settle on him . And that 's when he informed us , " The Mainland is going to invade Taiwan . " We could n't stop agreeing with him . Then his loyal wife added , " And we 'll win that war , too . " " Blood on the water , blood on the land , " " he sang . Worse than Marv , even . " And when blood is in the sky , the fight is won . " " " ' Blood in the sky ? " " I asked . " Space warfare , " he replied . In an instant . As if he 'd written the line himself . It went on that way for most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we were reneating the same verses for the fiftieth time - we could n't seem to drop the subject . I did n't hear a whisper about anyone 's kids or spouses or jobs , and nobody heard anything about my adventures , either . I did try to bail out . Once . I was up at the bar , shelling out too much for my second beer , and a tall woman appeared next to me , saying , " Steve ? Steve Dubrook ? " I looked at the name tag , then the face . Two or three tucks had left her skin stretched over old cheekbones . A tight little mouth smiled , and that 's when I remembered Jean . Our class president and valedictorian . She went off to the Ivy League , I remembered , and came out a tough , successful lawyer . I sputtered something like , " Hello . How 's stuff , Jean ? " " We were just talking , " she confessed , gesturing at the best-dressed group in the place . " ' Who knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event , I mean . And I think it 's you , Steve Dubrook . " " No , " I said . Pointblank . But she did n't believe me . " You two used to hang out together - " " We shared a locker , " I began . " And , " she added , " you listened while he abused that poor guitar . Remember those lunchtime concerts - ? " " I sat there once or twice . I guess . " She laughed . As if I was an idiot , she shook her head and said , " Judging by those lukewarm responses , I 'm guessing that you do n't see Marvin anymore . Is that a correct assessment , Steve ? " Jean was a stuck-up bitch in high school , and life just seemed to have honed those talents . " That 's too bad , " she told me . Then laughing again , she added , " What you should do , you know , is send a gift to your old buddy . With a note . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy you are for his welldeserved success . " Then she said , " I 've already sent my gift . " I had to ask , " Why bother ? " She found my stupidity to be fun . " Because , " she told me , giggling like a school girl . " Because that little shitfaced drug-addict is the most important and powerful man in our world today . " The economy kept up its robust collapse . By New Year 's , my store was suffering . My families were going to the cut-rate supermarkets , and my loyal customers - the ones who started with my father and stayed with me through lean times - were getting to that age where they were eating little , or being shipped off to nursing homes , or they were dead . I was n't bankrupt . Things were n't that bad , yet . But even after cutting back on payroll and working seventy hour weeks , I could see a bankruptcy in my personal future . Meanwhile , Marv was prospering . He and Mom bought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restoration . They moved in Christmas morning , and immediately the VIPs started falling over themselves , eager for an audience with our resident Visionary . Billionaires paid for the privilege . I heard . While politicians and the Hollywood-types gave what they could . I 'm assuming . Every night , the news gave an update on Marvin Donner 's social calendar . In February , it was the President himself . The old war hero dropped into town in Air Force One , just for the honor of standing on that wide old porch , shaking hands with a fellow who the Secret Service , on any normal day , would have watched extra close . Asked what he and the old hippie had discussed , the President said , " Issues . Trends . The promise of the future . " In other words , " No comment . " Next week , Senator Westfall announced his candidacy from the same porch . Marv stood next to him , staring off into nothingness . The Senator stroked his gray beard for the cameras , then told the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserve everything that Americans deserved and rightly expected . Who could argue with that ? And then he mentioned the Chinese without mentioning them . " Who else has a mandate to lead in times of strife and struggle ? " he asked us . " Who else is there but me ? " About that time , I got up the nerve to do what Jean recommended . The way I figured it , it would n't hurt . And maybe , just maybe , Marv would throw some business my way . Since I did n't know his eating habits , I decided on fruit . I put together a dozen big baskets of everything . The best and the exotic . Then after a good deal of hard thinking and doubts , I settled on a simple note written with my best pen . " Missed you at graduation , " I wrote . " All the best . " Steve Dubrook . " The baskets and my note were sent , and nothing happened . Which was a surprise , somehow . Like when you have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then it was weeks later , in the spring , and I got back to the apartment late one night , turning on the TV , the news telling me that Vladivostok had thrown off Moscow 's shackles and Westfall was leading in every poll and some astronomers in Chile had followed a suggestion in the " Will Be " lyrics . " The great comet comes from under our feet . " Sure enough , a giant lump of ice was falling toward the sun , its orbit ready to swing it within a couple million miles of the great Marvin Donner . And that 's when the phone rang . I figured trouble at work . One of the old freezers passed on , probably . I picked up , starting with a crisp , " What is it ? " The voice at the other end introduced herself as Miss So-and-so , and I was cordially invited to share dinner with Mr. Donner . " Would tomorrow night be convenient ? " I heard . " Perhaps at seven o'clock ? " I knew it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretary did n't give me time to make an ass of myself . " A car will pick you up , if you wish , " she told me . " At home or at work . " " Home , " I blurted . " That would be best , sir . " " This is ... this is for dinner ... ? " " Yes , sir , " she told me . Smooth as can be . Then she added , " And we ask that you come alone , Mr. Dubrook . And please , let 's keep this meeting strictly confidential . " For every reason , I was excited . Nervous . Nearly sick to my stomach , frankly . The car arrived at a quarter till . It was an ordinary sedan driven by some ex-Marine-type who greeted me by name , then said exactly three more words to me . " Buckle up , sir . " We arrived at the Redhall at exactly seven . A big iron gate swung open for us , and the driver let me off at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and walked across the enormous porch , thinking of all those important people who had come here , and because of it , practically doubling over from my bellyache . Just like the gate , the front door swung open for me . But instead of the butler that I expected , I found a young woman . Early twenties at the most . Tall and blonde , wearing tight slacks and a tighter shirt , and if anything thinner than she was beautiful . She said , " Hello , " with a soft , familiar voice . Then she said her name just as I remembered her . " Whitney Larson . " A songwriter and singer whose last album must have done dynamite business . Considering that even I knew who she was . Whitney called me , " Mr. Dubrook . " I mumbled something about liking her songs . " Oh , god , " she said . As if surprised . " Really ? Thank you so , so much ! " I just about panicked . What if she asked me questions about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me toward a set of French doors , telling me , " They 're waiting in here , Mr. Dubrook . " Here was some sort of parlor done up like a room in a museum . The tall chairs and big rug belonged to the late 1800s . Even the air tasted stuffy and old , I was thinking . As if I 'd just stepped back in time . They were Marv and his mother . I knew Marv 's face better than my own . That 's what television does for a person . He was sitting in the tallest chair , and I looked at him and tried to smile , and he stared through me for what felt like a year , big pale eyes brightening up with what looked to me , of all things , like tears . I tried to say , " Good to see you , Marv . " I do n't know if I got the words out . Then his mother was standing next to me . Maybe seventy years old , but vigorous as an old Chevy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , I was n't too sure . But she told me , " It 's good to meet you . It 's always a pleasure to know my son 's friends . " " And ... it 's good meeting you ... " I managed . Then I started to say , " Ma'am . " Mary cut me off . He shouted , " Is it ? " The eyes fought to focus on me . His body fought gravity and a pair of clumsy legs , trying to climb out of that antique chair while he sputtered , " Is it ? Is it ? " Whitney said , " No , love . " " No- ? " " Dinner . He 's here for dinner . " The girl seemed like a pro . She grabbed the seer by his shoulders , then steered him toward me . " Darling , " she purred , " Mr. Dubrook is a big fan of mine . " The pale eyes found me . His raspy voice said , " Are you ? A fan ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's good to see you . How are you , Marv ? " The question was too much . Again , the eyes lost contact . The boyish face suddenly filled with little wrinkles , and he looked old . More frail than his mother , easily . But he managed to tell me , " Not real bad . You know ? tw I nodded . As if I understood . Then his mother placed herself between us , saying , " This is such fun . Let 's continue this in the dining room . Shall we ? " ITHOUT QUESTION , it was some dinner . Their dining room was enormous and fancy and very modern - as modern as the parlor seemed old and we sat at one end of a glass table meant for forty , four fancy place settings waiting for us . Marv got the end position and an extra soft chair . His mother sat on his right , Whitney on his left , and when I hovered for a second , the girl patted the chair next to her , saying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I settled . Someone said , " Steve . " Marv 's voice was different now . Clearer , louder . I looked up and saw him staring at me , his face excited now . Then he took in a big breath and Then he sagged up against me , and to nobody in particular , he said , " It 's all right . It 's fine . " IS BEDROOM must have been the library once . It was on the ground floor , and it was huge , the tall walls covered with fancy , mostly empty bookshelves . Marv had me close the door . I felt like a high schooler spending time in a buddy 's house . I kept my voice down . I asked him , " Where do you want to go ? " and he had me ease him down on the edge of his enormous bed . Then I took the trouble of picking up a fancy-looking guitar , all bright and clean with a red-and-black checkered sling to ride the shoulder . Turning toward him , I asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward , showing me the top of his head . Intentionally , I mean . Ghostly fingers pulled apart the long hair , and where it was thinnest , I could see the vicious scars caused by his car crash . " I have headaches , " he said . " Always . " I said , " I 'm sorry . " " Maybe that 's why ... " he began . Then he hesitated , giving me a long , sad look before he told me , " Out of kindness , maybe . Because of my pain ? " I did n't have a clue what he was telling me . All I could think of saying was , " Maybe . " The guitar sat on the bed next to Mary . Forgotten . Up on the wall , between a window and the closed door , was a long whiteboard . Like something you 'd see in school . The date was written on it in big black numbers . " Are you all right , Marv ? Do you need anything ? " He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I started to ask him , " What do you need - ? " But he interrupted me . " I 'm sorry I could n't make it . To graduation , I mean . " " You had better things to do , " I told him . He snorted , then laughed . Which made him wince in pain , and he doubled over and coughed a few times . Weakly . From the other side of the door , his mother called out , " Are you all right , Marvin ? " at her own food , she helped Mom deal with Marv . Two Big Macs were sawed into bite sized pieces , and the women used their fingers , giving the poor guy advice about when to chew and when it was time to swallow . I tried not to stare . I tried to join in the conversation and give reasonable answers to the occasional question thrown my way . Once or twice , Whitney asked about my life . Then Mom would steer us back to her son . How did I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I said , " Pretty well , I think , " and I sensed from her face that it was n't the best possible answer . But before I could make another stab at it , she shook her head , telling me : " You know , you 're the only one who 's gotten to visit us . Among his childhood friends , I mean . " I guess I felt honored . That 's what I told her , at least . She wiped her son 's mouth . Not gently , but hard , like someone who could n't remember when she was n't wiping that mouth . Then Marv blurted out , " I asked . " He swallowed and said , " For you to come here . " I looked at him . " Thanks . " " Old ... friend ... " the poor guy croaked . " Yes , dear . Steve is a friend . " Mom wiped again , even harder this time . I put down what was left of my sandwich . Marv reached for me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still managed to be awfully thin . The hand was bones and pink fingernails and those pads of callus that guitar players get . On the spur of the moment , I asked , " Do you still play much , Marv ? " " Want to hear ... ? " he asked . A devilish grin filled his face . Then to his mother and his apparent girlfriend , he said , " Alone . In my room . " Neither woman spoke , nor moved . just like that , Marv was in charge . By himself , he tried to rise to his feet . Midway up , he paused and took a deep breath . Then I joined him , putting a hand under a skinny arm , feeling like a giant when I eased him into the standing position . Both women watched me , and I could n't read either of their faces . Then Marv pulled himself out of my hands , and he kissed both women on their mouths , telling them in a quiet , practiced way , " I love you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders , and old Mom just patted him on the back , telling him , " No . " Calmly and matter-offactly , she said , " This is dinner . Just dinner . " Then she told him the date . Whitney leaned close to me , and as if we were in study hall , she whispered , " It 's a matter of time . Marvin is uprooted in time . " All I could do was nod and say , " Huh . " " Uprooted , " she repeated , as if it was the official medical term . " One of our recent visitors was a Nobel winner , " she continued . " A physicist . Or a mathematician . Either way , he explained that somehow Marvin 's brain works backward . Sometimes the electrons travel in reverse inside him , and all of a sudden , the future turns into his past . Which is why he remembers things that have n't happened . And why he can seem , now and again , a little bit confused . " Again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mom . " Is that the way Dr. Roonie explained it ? " The old gal shook her head . " Not really . No . " But instead of setting us straight , she wadded up a napkin and dabbed the spit off of her son 's mouth and chin . The kitchen door opened . I found myself glad for the interruption . But instead of a fancy meal brought on silver trays , I saw another exMarine type carrying a pair of huge white sacks from McDonald 's . Mom tore both sacks open , then handed out the treasures . " Mr. Dubrook . A Big Mac , or a fish sandwich ? " " A Big Mac . Please . " " Shake or pop ? " " A shake ... I guess ... " " We have both , " she promised . I was nervous and a little confused . " Okay , " I said . " Both . " Which made her grimace . But she pushed two cups toward me , then made a third cup with one hand , holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid legs carrying him out of the room in a dead sprint , then back again , a cold can of pop in hand . The rest of the meal was only a little more soothing . Whitney kept trying to explain Marv 's state-of-mind . Or lack of it . And I tried to understand what she was telling me . Dinner for her was a diet Coke and a fish sandwich , minus the fish . When she was n't picking " No , " he replied . Then he was laughing again , his face twisted from the pleasure or the pain . I could n't tell which . Only one set of shelves had books . It looked like an old woman 's library . Reader 's Digest condensations , plus a few hundred romance paperbacks . I stared at the books because I did n't want to look at him anymore . Then I heard Marv telling me , " Yeah , it 's there , " as if I knew what he was talking about . " Right where you expect it , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clue in my head , I asked , " What are you talking about ? " He just smiled looking iust like that Roofv little twit that I 'd barely known all those years ago . Quietly , in a near-whisper , he said , " It 's on the top shelf . Behind the books . " " Are you still smoking ditch weed ? " I asked . He winked at me . And chuckled . I told him , " I hope you know , I never looked in your hiding place . " No response . " Except , " I added , " when they told me you were hurt . I was afraid they 'd search our locker , and I 'd get blamed for your shit . " " Look , " he urged me now . " I want you to . " I reached high , expecting a plastic sack full of drugs . But instead of that , I found an old spiral notebook , the paper one yellow and brittle . I opened it and flipped through the tired pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I was seeing . Words , written fast and sloppy . But I could decipher enough words to realize , " This is your song . Is n't it ? " " My song , " he chimed . Then again , he told me , " Look . " I thought I was . But then something obvious hit me , and I understood what he wanted . Trembling , I flipped to the last page , and I read it . After so many months of hearing Will Be on every radio , I knew instantly that this verse had never been sung in public . I said , " Shit . " " You found it , " he whispered . Then with a louder voice , he added , " This is n't the time . It 's too early . " I read the verse three or four times . Always , my eyes stuck on the name Steve Dubrook . Then I could n't read it anymore , and not knowing what to do , I put the notebook back in its hiding place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't remember being angry , or scared . I just wanted very much to be somewhere else in the world . " Come see me again , " Marv told me . That 's when I turned and told him , " You know , I was n't your friend . Trust me on that . We shared a locker , that 's all . I barely knew you ... you little shit ... " Marv smiled anyway , and he lay back on his bed , telling me , or maybe telling himself , " Some days , I want to die so much ... " I practically ran for the front door . His mother was sitting in the parlor , waiting for me . Her face was a mixture of anger and something else . Indifference . Acceptance . Whatever . She was bolt upright in one of the old chairs , her hands knotted up in her lap and her eyes cutting through me until I had to tell her , " I wo n't do it . It 's bullshit , and I wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " But you do n't have any choice . Do you ? " I turned and walked outside , crossing that giant porch . Whitney was waiting . She came at me and smiled in the oddest way . And as I was trying to slip around her , she planted a little wet kiss on my lips . " What 's that for ? " I sputtered . She just smiled in a bleak , forgiving way . Again , I said , " What ? " " I 'm an excellent judge of people , " the girl purred . " And I think you 're really a fine person , Mr. Dubrook . When it 's time and you do it , you 'll be acting out of kindness . Just like Marv wants - " " Fuck Marv ! " I screamed . And that was the moment , the very first one , that I actually felt that maybe I could , like the song says , " Put a bullet into the singer 's face . " The rest of my story is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tried to live my own life , taking care of my business and enjoying the occasional date . There were days when I very nearly convinced myself that the last verse would remain secret . A private mistake . But there were also days when Whitney or Mother Donner would come into my store , pretending to need groceries . In other words , they were checking up on me , and reminding me that they had n't forgotten . One day , I walked up to that old woman . " I wo n't do it , " I promised . " I wo n't shoot him , or kick him . Or even see him again . " Which would have been welcome news , if you 're a normal mom with a normal kid . But she was n't . In her mind , I was an agent of God or the Future . Whichever . And since I needed prodding , she must have gotten Whitney to talk with Rolling Stone . At the end of the interview , apparently by accident , the girl let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then she told the world what was supposed to happen . And if that was n't sick enough , she let the reporter know just enough to follow the trail back to me . I thought I had a plan ready . If the secret ever broke , I told myself , I was going to empty out the cash drawers and my bank accounts and borrow on my credit cards . Then I would disappear into Mexico , or out on the high seas somewhere . The problem was that I needed time to vanish . Which the press did n't give me . I went to bed as one person , then woke up famous . Infamous . Whatever . Police had to set up barricades around my store to hold back the crowds , then the car traffic got too heavy , and they shut down the street in front of us . But still thousands came through the doors in those first days , hoping to see the famous angel of death , and sometimes they would buy a pack of gum or a package of T-bones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was I stupid to ever think that I could actually vanish , but I was even more of an idiot to think that I 'd want to . Letterman and Leno had fun at my expense . Those old bastards told their stupid jokes , and I got angry . But it did n't do any good , so I just stopped watching them . People I met and people who 'd known me for years wanted to know how it was to be part of the most famous song of all time . But really , is n't that what we 've all been doing for the last year , anyway ? Everything 's been decided for us . Everyone has agreed . In another year-plus , Westfall will be our President and we 'll be fighting with China . And of course we 'll win . We know that 's the truth because some guy who ca n't even hold up half a conversation once wrote something that never actually mentioned the Chinese . Sometimes I lie awake , and I just wonder . Lucee 's back in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the store every day . Just to wink and wave and hope that I 'll give her two seconds of time . I 'm the hub of history , she tells me . When I give her the chance . In these last weeks , about a hundred different lawyers have sent me business cards . One of them wrote , " Think of me afterward . If it looks like a mercy killing , I can get you 2 to 5 . Down to time served , with good behavior . " Just the other day , I was pulled over for doing fifty in a thirty-five zone . But the cop recognized me and let me off with a warning . Or two warnings , really . He said , " Mr. Dubrook , " with a quiet , serious voice . He said , " The kind way , really , is to put it here . " Then he touched his own temple , giving me this knowing little wink . Honestly , a man has to just wonder . There 's a thousand ways to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every version works well enough . So why could n't some head-wounded druggy write a bunch of nonsense that only seems to have come true ? We 've been playing this huge and dangerous and very stupid game . Tomorrow , Senator Westfall blows back into town . He 's leading in the polls by barely thirty points , and his opponent has grown his own scraggly gray beard . Which means it 's time for another visit to poor Marv . Maybe I could get onto the grounds , and with a cheap revolver , put a bullet into the mansion 's fancy woodwork . Then I would sit in a prison cell for the next few years , safe and tidy , and people around the world would realize that not everything in that damned song was going to come true . Except I do n't want to sit in any prison . Ever . And I suppose I could kill myself now . Today . That would hopefully put an end to this craziness . But I 'm not going to be that kind of hero . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cornered me against the greeting cards . She told me exactly how many days it was until the big day , then she asked me how it felt to be one of God 's angels . " Shit , " I said . I told her that I was just going to keep living my life . And why not ? My business is booming . There 's some nice ladies who find me intriguing but they do n't bring these things up over dinner . Or in bed . Plus Letterman 's people are talking about a little something next month . And of course , people like you are paying for this interview . For me , life has never been better . But Lucee could n't drop it . She kept calling me God 's angel and asking how it felt . And finally , I flat-out told her , " I 'm not going to shoot anyone . Particularly not Marvin Donner . When the big day comes , I 'm going to be somewhere else . And I 'm not telling where . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How can you avoid your destiny ? " " Easily , " I replied . " But if you do n't do this one thing , " she sputtered , in horror , " then our future ... it 's totally and forever changed ... ! " Which made me laugh . That 's what I did . I just held my belly and shook my head and laughed , and after a little moment , I said , " Darling . " I said , " Do n't you get it ? That 's the way it 's always been . " " T
