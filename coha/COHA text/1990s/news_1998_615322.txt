<p> U.S. Senate hopeful Bob Inglis trots through downtown Aynor , pausing long enough to shake voters ' hands and tout his conservative vision for South Carolina . <p> But even as he hustles along the route of this small town 's recent parade , the 38-year-old Republican never catches up with his rival , Sen. Ernest " Fritz " Hollings . <p> Hollings , the Democratic incumbent first elected 32 years ago , is riding high as grand marshal of the Harvest Hoe-Down Festival parade . Popular in this Democratic patch of increasingly Republican South Carolina , he waves from the back of a burgundy Chevrolet Caprice convertible . <p> Inglis would love to rain on Hollings ' parade , but recent polls shows that the South 's senior Democrat is hanging on to his lead in the bruising battle for South Carolina 's political soul . <p> Even so , Hollings ca n't help but glance over his shoulder in what is shaping up to be one of America 's fiercest congressional races . In national terms , it also is one of the most pivotal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who earlier proposed that he and Hollings agree to a contract of civility , recently called Hollings a " sugar daddy " of federal dollars for South Carolina . <p> Contending that Hollings , 76 , is out of touch with South Carolinians , the Inglis campaign offered the senator a free cellular phone and beeper programmed with the message , " Senator , South Carolina deserves to hear from you . " <p> Hollings declined the offer . He has agreed to two debates this month with Inglis , whom he has labeled at different times as a " hypocrite , " a " total fraud " and an " opportunist . . . who has no record at all . " <p> An Inglis victory on Nov. 3 would strengthen the GOP 's control of South Carolina politics in Washington as well as in Columbia , where the Confederate battle flag fluttering atop the Statehouse signals a conservative tilt . <p> Although Hollings has raised a reported $ 2.5 million for the campaign compared with Inglis ' $ 1.4 million , he concedes this race is his toughest ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bid to gain an even firmer hold on the U.S. Senate . <p> Pundits say the outcome could be influenced by the Clinton-Lewinsky sex scandal as well as South Carolina Gov . David Beasley 's re-election troubles . <p> As a member of the House Judiciary Committee investigating whether to launch impeachment proceedings against the president , Inglis has urged Clinton to resign . Hollings has criticized the president 's behavior but has n't called for his resignation . <p> " Clinton is really an albatross for Hollings , " said Clemson University political scientist Charles Dunn . " Clinton was never real popular in this state except among blacks . " <p> If black voters express their displeasure over the Clinton affair by staying away from the polls , Hollings would suffer , Dunn said . On the other hand , voters incensed by Republicans ' release of thousands of pages of lurid details about Clinton and the former White House intern could penalize Republican candidates . <p> The Inglis camp also could be hurt by Republican Beasley 's suddenly tight race with former state legislator Jim Hodges , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsuccessfully to outlaw video poker , estimates that the gambling industry is spending $ 1 million to $ 2 million a week on Hodges ' campaign . <p> South Carolina Democrats hope that financial support will help revive their party , while Inglis concedes , " The video poker thing has fueled some Democratic resurgence because they get money that they have n't had in the past . " <p> Hollings and Inglis are from different eras , reflecting the sweeping political and cultural changes in South Carolina and across the South . <p> Inglis depicts Hollings as out of step on welfare reform and other initiatives intended to wean Americans from federal aid . <p> Hollings " walks around . . . basically offering to be the sugar daddy who will hand out government programs and grants , " Inglis said . <p> A " government guarantee gives me a place in public housing ; it gives me a community center ; it gives me a welfare check , " Inglis said . " Free enterprise and opportunity gives me a three-bedroom , one-and-a-half bath house with a concrete driveway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hollings touts his long incumbency , which has helped him pump money for roads , bridges and other projects into his state . <p> The senator 's campaign staff has attacked Inglis ' voting record , painting him as a U.S. congressman opposed to many federal spending projects , some in South Carolina . <p> Inglis has voted against legislation that would provide federal funds for Charleston bridge repairs . Closer to home , he refused to sign a South Carolina delegation letter asking for federal money to improve the Greenville-Spartanburg Airport . <p> Hollings , a Charleston lawyer elected as South Carolina 's governor in 1958 , rose to prominence when Lowcountry Democrats ruled state politics . <p> In recent years , the power has shifted upstate , where a booming industrial economy has given Republicans a foothold that is spreading fast to other increasingly prosperous areas , such as Rock Hill , Hilton Head Island and Myrtle Beach . <p> A turning point came in 1996 , the first time a majority of voters  --  51 percent  --  identified themselves as Republicans in a state once solidly Democratic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whites , " said Glen Broach , a Winthrop University political scientist . <p> Buoyed by the political shift are young Republicans such as Inglis , a Greenville lawyer who has served three terms in the U.S. House . He 's a conservative Christian whose wife and five children sometimes accompany him on the campaign trail . <p> Well-known upstate , Inglis faces one of his toughest challenges while trying to spread his name among voters in the Midlands and the Lowcountry . <p> " That may be the Achilles ' heel of the Inglis campaign : People have never voted for him outside of his district , " said Blease Graham , a University of South Carolina political scientist . <p> Yet on the campaign trail , it 's hard to miss Inglis , or at least his bright-red RV , which is festooned with a much-larger-than-life photograph of the candidate 's head and a slogan : " Finally , someone 's listening ! " <p> Even though Inglis supported the 1994 re-election of South Carolina 's senior senator , Republican Strom Thurmond , Inglis favors term limits as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He 's obviously taking aim at Hollings , first elected to the Senate in 1966 , when Inglis was in elementary school . Inglis , who refuses money from political action committees , portrays Hollings as a relic of " old-time politics . " <p> Hollings counters that Inglis " takes laundered PAC money " when he accepts contributions from the state and national Republican parties , which take PAC money . <p> At Inglis ' campaign headquarters in Columbia , staffers keep track of Hollings ' remarks , hoping he 'll say something offensive , as he did in 1992 . <p> That year , amid Japanese-American tension elevated by Japanese officials ' remark that Americans lack a work ethic , Hollings told factory workers in Hartsville , S.C. , that they " should draw a mushroom cloud and put under it : Made in America by lazy and illiterate Americans and tested in Japan . " <p> Despite such occasional missteps , Hollings has a broad base of support . <p> He won a narrow 1992 victory over Republican Tommy Harnett , a former U.S. congressman . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including ones still clinging to government help in their struggle toward prosperity . <p> He also has a loyal following among those who regard him as an early leader of South Carolina 's transformation from a rural , agricultural economy to a diversified industrial base . <p> Hollings played a role in the creation of the state 's network of technical colleges , a lure to global manufacturers such as BMW Manufacturing Corp . in Greer . <p> Hollings also is a big supporter of the state 's tobacco farmers and textile and apparel industries , which , despite hard times , remain influential in state politics . <p> In a recent stump speech in Aynor , a farming community of 470 people in Horry County , Hollings pledged support to keep family farms alive . <p> " That 's the heartbeat not just of South Carolina , but the heatbeat of America , " said Hollings , whose nostalgic message struck a chord with many in the crowd . <p> Aynor Mayor John Dawsey said , " When people in the community have problems , we are able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . " <p> Inglis predicts his message will play better than Hollings ' in Republican strongholds such as Myrtle Beach . <p> And , he says , he and his party have the momentum . <p> " The state is six years more Republican than it was when the senator ran , " Inglis said .
