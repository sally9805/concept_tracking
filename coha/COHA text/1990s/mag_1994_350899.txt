Even before the storm that trampled through the East Coast of the U.S. last week , the 15th such tempest in the nastiest winter in recent memory , American insurance companies had forlornly concluded that all their carefully calculated predictions about the world 's weather have been blown way off course . Aetna Life and Casualty announced last Monday that first-quarter earnings would plunge $120 million  --  in part because of claims related to January and February 's weather . Industrywide , weather-related claims for these two months may total $825 million , on top of $1.75 billion in insured losses caused by the monstrous winter storm that battered 24 states in March a year ago and $19.5 billion in losses caused by Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki in 1992 . <P> That kind of hemorrhaging tends to draw executive attention . While scientists debate whether and when global warming will occur , property insurers are suffering the consequences of a climate that they believe is already changing , at least in terms of financial risk . Storms , floods and droughts are hitting populated areas with greater frequency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 years . Natural disasters during the ' 80s , for instance , were 94% more frequent than in the 1970s . While it is possible that such a jump falls within normal climatic variation , insurance executives realize that it also conforms with patterns predicted for global warming . <P> PREDICTION : As warming heats the oceans , the area of water warm enough to produce hurricanes ( water temperatures above 80 degreesF ) will expand , producing longer and more intense storm seasons . <P> REALITY : The area of ocean where surface waters are warmer than 80 degreesF has already expanded one-sixth during the past 20 years . <P> PREDICTION : Sea levels will rise as warmer oceans expand and ice caps and snow cover melt . <P> REALITY : During the past 100 years , the sea level has risen 1 ft. along the U.S. Atlantic Coast , causing beaches to recede between 200 ft. and 300 ft. on average . Stephen Leatherman , director of the University of Maryland 's Laboratory for Coastal Research , says sea level is now at the highest mark in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times as fast as before . <P> Faced with such unsettling coincidences , some key industry figures have begun to wonder whether they are n't seeing a preview of the costs climate change may impose on society . " The insurance business is first in line to be affected by climate change , " says Franklin Nutter , president of the Reinsurance Association of America . " It is clear that global warming could bankrupt the industry . " Insurers must set their premiums in anticipation of future calamities , Nutter and his colleagues know , and when they look ahead , they see prospects even more alarming than those in the recent past .
