Good reporting is seldom easy or comfortable . But for correspondent Ted Gup , getting to the bottom of this week 's BUSINESS story about life and hard times in a West Virginia coal community was especially unsettling . " The first time I entered a low-seam coal mine was one of the most claustrophobic experiences of my life , " says Gup . " You lie on your back on a metal sled , and the distance between the floor and ceiling is never greater than 40 inches . You 're in utter darkness  --  except for the light on your hard hat . You eat your lunch on your back with your pail on your belly . Twenty-four hours after you get out , the insides of your nostrils are still black with dust . " <P> For Gup , an investigative reporter with a taste for hands-on journalism , there was no question that to write about coal miners he would have to go into the mines . Two years ago , he logged 35,000 miles following the trail of illicit ivory for a cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 days with loggers in the forests of Oregon to cover the battle over the spotted owl . " If a story is worth doing , it 's worth doing thoroughly , " he says . " I find that whatever truth there is emerges not in the second or third interview , but well down the line . " <P> - All told , Gup spent a month in Logan County , W. Va. , a microcosm for hundreds of company towns built around ailing industries . " It 's a subtle story , " says senior editor Stephen Koepp . " It 's about how these people became dependent on , almost addicted to , a way of life . " It 's also a story about cheating and corruption , practices that Gup experienced firsthand . One day a mine tour he had been promised was abruptly canceled . Reason given : a federal agent was inspecting the facilities , although there was no inspector there . Several witnesses told Gup the real reason was that safety equipment hastily erected for an earlier inspection had been removed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day after Gup visited  --  which sent a warning , intended or not , to other mine operators to keep TIME out . " They 're more accustomed to dealing with reporters who call from Washington , " Gup says . " It 's harder to control us when we 're in the mines . " Which is precisely why a good reporter insists on going in.
