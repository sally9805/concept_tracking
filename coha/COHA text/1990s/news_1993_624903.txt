<p> It was the kind of death that might have been filed away as a mystery forever . <p> A seemingly healthy , 58-year-old Angelina County nurse checks into her own hospital and dies in early June , and no one can find a cause . <p> But two factors played a major role in unraveling the mystery : <p> The similarity between her death and that of 22 people in the Four Corners area of the southwestern United States . <p> The public health community 's growing concern about emerging new viruses and bacteria . <p> The sudden outbreak of rodent-borne hantaviruses in the Southwest took the public by surprise , but experts were ready for it . <p> A group of them predicted this kind of problem in a report issued last October by the Washington , D.C.-based Institute of Medicine . <p> The report warns that emergence of new infectious diseases is inevitable . <p> " " It takes eternal vigilance , " said Dr. Joshua Lederberg of Rockefeller University in New York City who headed the study . <p> " " Hantaviruses were among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human population , " he said . <p> Dr.Alan Barrett , a researcher at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston who has intensively studied these kinds of viruses , explained that there are two different types of emerging microbes : Those that appear to be totally new , such as human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , and those that change habitat by jumping from animals to man . <p> That was the pattern taken by the hantaviruses . <p> " " That is related to environment and ecology , " he said . <p> Previous cases could have been overlooked , Barrett said , if they occurred singly . " " We were n't looking for it . " <p> But when a number of people became ill in the isolated Four Corners area  --  where New Mexico , Arizona , Colorado and Utah converge  --  the problem became clear , he said . <p> In fact , it appears there have been previous infections there , Barrett said . <p> The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta has found blood samples indicating the virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , no one looked for the cause . <p> " " Now that we know the infection exists , people will start to go back to look for it , " he said . <p> Texas health officials are still puzzling over how the woman , who had not traveled to the Four Corners area , contracted hantavirus . It was the first U.S.case to occur outside that area . <p> The success of researchers in New Mexico in identifying the virus was due , in part , to the isolation of the area and the good communication among the public health providers working with local Native American populations , Lederberg said . <p> But while 12 cases in isolated areas of the southwestern U.S. first rang an alarm , " " as many cases in a crowded metropolitan area would n't have drawn attention , " Lederberg said . <p> In the report that he co-authored , experts called for a more organized approach to such investigations with better support and more information sharing . It is an approach that Texas officials support as they attempt to learn about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would be nice if we could catch such outbreaks after the first case or three , " Lederberg said . <p> There are six known forms of hantaviruses worldwide , and two were first identified in the United States in the mid-1980s  --  one in Maryland and one in the south central town of Leakey , Texas . <p> While each infects rodents , neither has been shown to cause disease in humans . <p> However , the first form of the virus , found near the River Hantaan in China , is particularly virulent , attacking the kidneys and causing a hemorrhagic fever , a deadly bleeding condition . <p> A milder form of the disease was first identified in Seoul , South Korea , and is known by that city 's name although it can be found in many parts of the world , said Barrett . <p> The Puumala form of hantavirus was first found in Finland and the Thottalayan form is another Asian virus , Barrett said . <p> The cases in New Mexico appear most closely related to the Seoul viruses , Barnett said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lungs instead of the kidneys . <p> Barrett hastens to add , though , that the hantaviruses in the Four Corners region are probably native to the United States . <p> In addition to the viruses found in Leakey and Baltimore , a variant was discovered in Houston rats in 1984 by tests now considered crude . <p> There probably will be more cases of hantavirus infections reported in coming months because doctors are aware of the possibility , predicted Dr. Robert Couch of Baylor College of Medicine . <p> Couch pointed out that Legionnaire 's and Lyme disease were virtually unknown until outbreaks aroused concern . But testing of old blood specimens indicated that the disease had almost certainly struck before . <p> The problem occurs when man invades animal habitats , he said . <p> " " Once it 's in the population ( of rodents ) , there are increasing infections in that animal reservoir . It will spill over into the human population , " Couch said . <p> That 's what happens almost annually in Houston , when mosquitoes bite birds infected with the St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the human population . <p> In hospitals where patients are treated with strong drugs to knock out infection , newly emerging microbes are frequently recognized and reported , Couch said . Each represents a new set of problems for doctors and nurses alike . <p> " " It 's a major cause of infection and disease , " Couch said . <p> Lederberg 's group warned that tracking and responding to disease outbreaks is the only way that science can control the threat of new microbes . <p> Part of the problem is complacency , the New York scientist said . <p> " " We had astounding success with the antibiotic revolution , " Lederberg said . <p> His report recommends : <p> Better methods for tracking and responding to disease outbreaks . <p> More resources for the CDC so it can develop new disease tracking strategies and better ways to monitor hospital-acquired infections . <p> Establishment of a federal database about new infectious diseases , including information on how to get drugs and vaccines . <p> Encouragement of a global infectious disease surveillance system . <p> Development of new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insects that carry them . <p> Setting up training programs for experts in the field of tracking and treating such diseases . <p> Such measures are crucial to solving the problem , said Lederberg . The current AIDS pandemic is an example . <p> " " AIDS caught us with our guard down . Who would have thought such a tiny virus could pack such a wallop ? " he asked . <p> Another pandemic is not out of the question , he said . The biggest threat is influenza . <p> Currently , most of the world 's population has some immunity to flu viruses because they 've had the disease before . Even if they are infected with a new variant of the virus , their immune response makes the symptoms less severe . <p> There has n't been a totally new form of flu virus since 1919 , when it hit the world in epidemic proportions , killing millions . <p> It 's for that kind of disaster that Lederberg and his colleagues believe that the world should prepare . <p> " " It 's a necessity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private companies are unwilling to develop the resources needed to make a vaccine against that kind of threat as soon as it pops up , then the public sector should do it , Lederberg said . " " I guarantee that that kind of disaster will come again . "
