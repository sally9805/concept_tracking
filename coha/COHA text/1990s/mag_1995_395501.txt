If  --  as it is often said  --  love makes the world go " round , then Hollywood has n't done much to show that loving relationships between Black men and Black women have been and continue to be a major part of this scenario . During the past 50 years , filmmakers  --  with the exception of a very few  --  have portrayed Black love as nothing more than pure lust and sex . No romance . No affection . No devotion . None of the passion , tenderness and individual respect that are so prominent in the love stories that are played out every day by millions of Black men and Black women in the real world . " It 's my personal opinion that Hollywood has never supported in their images or given credence to Black family life , and therefore if you are not portraying the Black family as a strong , viable institution and you do n't believe there are strong Black families headed by a Black man and Black woman , then it 's very difficult to portray a very sensitive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Mary Smith , president of the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame , Inc . Traditionally , Black love has been depicted as something far removed from White romantic relationships , where White actors frequently portray characters involved in sensitive , passionate love scenes that exhibit the beauty and depth of love between a man and woman . Prior to 1945 , there were few Black leading men who were n't " characters , " and films that touched on Black romance often were more comic than long and featured some unbelievable pairings like Lena Horne and Eddie ( Rochester ) Anderson in Cabin In The Sky , and Horne and Bill Robinson in Stormy Weather . Although the realistic portrayal of Black love has never been on Hollywood 's priority list , a small number of movies has given the world some insight into the real Black love story . But nothing really changed until after World War II . The " character " actors were replaced by the likes of Sidney Poitier , Harry Belafonte and Sammy Davis Jr. , who were thrust into leading-man roles and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kitt in such movies as Porgy and Bess and Anna Lucasta , the story of a reformed prostitute . It was during the ' ' 50s that Belafonte and Dandridge displayed a special kind of magic in a series of movies , but perhaps no film sparked as much interest as the 1954 production of Carmen Jones . In the lavish , all-Black production , Belafonte and Dandridge were involved in a steamy , passionate love affair . It was the first time that many Black viewers had seen Black actors involved in a sizzling romance that in some ways mirrored their own . Dandridge twisted the title role ( based on the opera Carmen ) around her finger , playing a sexy factory worker who corrupts Belafonte , dumps him and is killed by him for her unfaithfulness . That performance earned her an Academy Award nomination as Best Actress of the Year , making her the first Black to gain such an honor . In the process , her glamor and grandeur turned her into an authentic sex symbol for Black and White America , but Hollywood was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a leading lady , and leading ladies make love to leading men . With Dorothy 's sex appeal , her character had to reflect her sensuality . At the time , Belafonte and Poitier were the only Black romantic male leads . But rather than team her with them or some other charismatic Black actor , producers decided to cast her in some less-than-memorable interracial love roles that had to be limited to little more than hand holding . It was not until 1959 that Dandridge was featured in another Black romance  --  Porgy and Bess , in which she portrayed Poitier 's love interest . Dandridge 's plight , critics say , is just one example of how racism manifests itself in Hollywood 's decision-making process . " There is this agenda that comes out of Hollywood , whether it is conscious or unconscious , whether it 's knee-jerk racism or strategized racism , the fact of the matter is that the Black male and the Black female do n't get a fair shake in terms of the type of sensibilities and sensitivities that one finds in many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who is president of William Greaves Productions , Inc. , in New York . " You have to face up to the fact that America has not yet emerged from the Middle Ages in terms of its race relations . It 's a long , hard fight to convert this country into the democracy it purports to be . " The fight to convert Hollywood essentially began in the ' ' 60s during the Civil Rights Movement . It was a time when the redefinition of the Black experience was aggressively addressed and Sidney Poitier had established himself as the only Black actor to work consistently in leading dramatic roles . Although the Academy Award-winner made his mark on the decade , he was viewed as a rather chaste character until 1968 . That 's when his idea for a Black love story was developed into the romantic comedy For Love of Ivy . In it , Poitier , a suave professional gambler , uses his charm to sweep Abbey Lincoln off her feet , and in the process , presents his audience with a new dimension of his character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Black male/Black female relationship they had been looking for , many observers believe that the best of the handful of sensitive love stories that appeared in the ' ' 60s was the 1963 production of Nothing But A Man . The low-budget , independently produced film about life in segregated rural Alabama starred Ivan Dixon and Abbey Lincoln and is widely regarded as one of the best films ever made about Black family life . Not only did the film deal with the love of two people who exhibited respect and support for each other , it also dealt with the pride of a man who struggled to earn a decent salary so that he could support his family . Perhaps this love story was more appealing because the couple faced numerous hardships but eventually overcame them together . More importantly , Nothing But A Man also showed a loving relationship could be expressed in ways other than hugging and kissing , and jumping in an out of bed . However , with all of its positives , the film 's commercial success was limited due to its distributor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line has always been Hollywood 's guide , and moviemakers still adhere to their beliefs that the majority of the people in this country wo n't pay to see a story in which there is a strong , loving relationship within a black family . But many of those who were leery about producing Black love stories had no problem funding films in the ' ' 70s that launched the " Blaxploitation " era and gave birth to the Black superstud . That explosion of movies gave us the likes of Shaft , Sweet Sweetback 's Baadassss Song , Super Fly , The Mack and Melinda . Although these productions created employment for Black actors and actresses , they brought a whole new range of negativity and stereotypes , including the portrayal of Black women as sexual playthings who slipped into bed with one man after another without prior emotional involvement or romantic prelude . Even though the " superstud " movies dominated the ' ' 70s , there were some excellent films that explored Black love and romance and turned out to be among the most popular productions during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Claudine ( Diahann Carroll and James Earl Jones ) and Lady Sings The Blues ( Billy Dee Williams and Diana Ross ) are three of the most memorable . The " Blaxploitation " era gave way to the ' ' 80s , which ushered in some new perspectives and some surprises , including the pairing of Cicely Tyson and Richard Pryor in Bustin ' Loose . On the surface sore thought it was an ill-fated match , but the romantic comedy turned out to be a beautiful love story , where  --  during a hectic , cross-country bus ride with a bunch of rowdy kids  --  the two gradually fall in love and later profess that love for each other . Some critics still say it was Pryor 's best work on film to date . By the mid- ' ' 80s a new group of Black independent filmmakers , led by Spike Lee , began producing a variety of films that addressed a wide range of subjects that Black audiences could identify with , including those that dealt with Black love . Lee got the ball rolling with She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later capitalized on Denzel Washington 's matinee idol persona when he teamed the Academy Award-winner with Joie Lee in Mo ' Better Blues . Not surprisingly , these young , innovative filmmakers have highlighted many aspects of Black love , oftentimes choosing not to rely on the predictable , tried-and-true story lines that have become routine . In Coming to America , for example , Eddie Murphy employed the usual scenario of boy sees girl , boy pursues girl , and boy finally gets girl . Later , though , Boomerang offered a different twist and delivered a message that opened the eyes of millions of Black men . In the film , the tables are turned on Murphy , a suave ladies ' man who falls in love with his career-driven boss ( Robin Givens ) . They enter into a brief on-again , off-again sexual affair , but Givens wo n't take him seriously and eventually casts him aside . Along the way Murphy learns the difference between sex and the true love that 's offered by Halle Berry . Reginald Hudlin , who co-produced the movie with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many complaints about guys who are immature in their treatment of women , and to make a story about a guy who not only is obsessed with women but leans to appreciate their true value , we thought would be a story that audiences would connect to . " Simply put , movie insiders say , if this kind of connection is to be strengthened  --  and if it there is to be a continuous true depiction of the real Black love story  --  it will be delivered by independent Black filmmakers like the Hudlin brothers . It 's doubtful , for example , that the passion and caring displayed by Jada Pinkett and Allen Payne in last summer 's hit Jason 's Lyric would have been on the screen without the efforts of producer George Jackson and producer/director Doug McHenry . " It really does n't make sense to rely upon another culture to describe you and define you , " says Smith of the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame . " Regardless of how well-meaning they may be , I do n't think it 's truly possible for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these images and tell our own story . " That story  --  the one about Black love and romance  --  basically has been the victim of Hollywood 's cold shoulder . But with more aggressive action by Black filmmakers and Hollywood 's eventual acknowledgement that romance is indeed a part of the African-American experience , perhaps the industry will no longer restrict or ignore genuine love relationships between Black men and Black women , but rather embrace them .  --  Lisa C.
