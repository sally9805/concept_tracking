Heroes , it seems , do n't have to be human // Most days they stick to their routinewallowing in mud , cracking sunflower seeds , chasing cars . But when danger strikes , they step to the fore , often on four feet . They 're animal heroes , and they ask nothing for their bravery ) though most would n't turn down a pat and an extra scoop of kibble-and maybe one of those cool chew toys , as long as you 're asking ) . " Animals do n't act out of instinct any more than we do , " says Elizabeth Marshall Thomas , author of 1993 's bestseller The Hidden Life of Dogs . " We see a need to help , and we rush in .

After passing through the woods , they headed home across frozen Lake Simcoe . But as the dogs bounded ahead , Gilchrist , 61 , felt the ice give way . " I was walking along and went " pop " right through , " he recalls . " It happened so fast . I thought , This could be the end .

As they thrashed about , Tiree appeared . " All I could think was that she 'd meet our same fate , " says Gilchrist . Instead the whining dog crouched on her belly and crawled to the hole .

While the 200-pound Gilchrist hung on , the dogs clawed backward until he was safe . " They had every right to run ashore , " says Gilchrist , who , back home , gave his dogs a hot bath . " They risked their lives to save me . " Having since won several awards for heroism , Tiree , 2 , is back to her happy-go-lucky self , but Tara , 5 , " is paranoid now about water , " says Gilchrist . Of course , so is he . " I will never go out on the lake when it 's frozen-or let my animals . " The Cat 's Meow Despite the heartbreak they had already suffered-three children who died during birthBernita Rogers , a nurse , and her husband , Roy , then an Army lieutenant colonel stationed at Fort Leavenworth , Kans. , were determined to have a family . So when their fourth child , Stacey , though premature , was born healthy in May 1986 , the couple were ecstatic . " Needless to say , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us . " Six weeks later the five-pound infant came down with what appeared to be a cold . Immediately , Bernita rushed Stacey to a doctor . " He thought I was overreacting , " she says . " He told me to just put a humidifier in her room . " Back at home , as Stacey napped in her nursery , Bernita tried to relax in another room , but Midnight , the family cat , would n't let her . " He was being such a nuisance , " she says . " He kept jumping on my lap and batting my legs . This was n't his usual behavior . " Shooed away , Midnight persisted . " I heard him through the baby monitor in the nursery-an eerie moaning sound , " says Bernita . Alarmed , she ran to Stacey 's room , where the frantic cat was perched atop the dresser-and Stacey was blue and gasping for air . Taken to the hospital , she was resuscitated for respiratory failure and diagnosed with a viral infection . If not for Midnight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . " Now 11 , Stacey lives with her parents in Kansas City . A healthy fifth-grader , she thinks the whole story is " kinda neat . " As for Midnight , now 13 , he does n't have much energy for hunting-or heroics . " Mostly he likes to just lie in the sun , " says Stacey . " I think he could do that all day . " Circle of Friends Daisy , the 25-year-old " bell cow " of Donald Mottram 's farm in Meidrim , west Wales , knows her job and does it well . " She saves me a lot of work , " says Mottram , 55 .

Motorbiking across his property to tend to a sick calf , Mottram suddenly felt a " horrendous thump " on his back . Landing faceup , he found an angry 3,300-pound bull , on loan to him for breeding , hovering overhead . " He started stamping on my chest and shoulders , " says Mottram . " I thought I was going to die . " Falling unconscious , he came to surrounded by a large group of his cows .

" Pig 's Feat After losing their 33-acre Oregon farm in 1995 , Collin and Deb Stolpe headed to Aurora , Colo. , living in their converted school bus . With them was Snort , Deb 's newborn potbellied pig . " Baby Snort was like a three-pound bag of sugar , " says Deb , 44 . Collin , 48 , was less smitten : " I was n't looking for ward to living in these quarters with a pig . " Then , on Nov. 14 , 1995 , Snort 's presence proved invaluable . That night , with the windows shut tight to block the cold , Deb was roused by Snort 's squealing : " She was oinking , snorting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deb carried the housebroken pig outside . She did the same an hour later . But when Snort squealed a third time , Deb turned to Collin-only to find him convulsing . " I thought he was having a heart attack , " she says . With her speech suddenly slurred and her vision hazy , Deb realized she too was unwell . Taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital , the Stolpes were diagnosed with near-fatal levels of carbon monoxide poisoning caused by their propane heater . Says attending physician Dr. William Clem : " The Stolpes were far better off for having been awakened . " Snort now lives in a children 's petting zoo near the Sioux City , Iowa , apartment the Stolpes moved to in January . But the couple-Collin remodels homes , and Deb works at a Ford dealership-visit often . " It 's kind of embarrassing to have a pig save your life , " says Collin . " But I thank God she was there that night " cause I have a lot of living left .

As always , Haven , the Chihuahua belonging to his grandmother Phyllis Ingham , was nearby . " Sean loves to crack and eat pecans , and so does Haven , " says Sean 's mother , Lisa Harry , 25 , a homemaker . " We were all just having a nice time . " Trouble began after Sean wandered over to a pile of hay . " I heard him scream , " says Lisa . " It was an unbelievable scream , one that I had never heard . I just froze . " A three-foot poisonous black water moccasin-no doubt visiting from the nearby swamp-had lunged at the toddler 's legs , and was now hanging by its fangs from Sean 's pants . " The snake was jerking Sean so that his whole body was wiggling , " says Lisa . Immediately , Haven leapt into action . " She jumped right on the snake , put her paws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she got it off . " Though Sean 's jeans were sprayed with venom-and bore two fang-holes-he had not been poisoned . " A bite certainly could have killed him , " says Dr. Henry Gainey , who treated Sean at a nearby hospital . But Sean has yet to show the 21/2-year-old dog proper gratitude . Instead he tends to poke his fingers in her eyes . Sighs Ingram : " He 's wanting to love her , but does n't realize he 's hurting her .

Minutes earlier , Lisa Nibley , 15 , and her brother Joey , 12 , tourists from Battle Ground , Wash. , who had been swimming , found themselves caught in the river 's current . Joey managed to reach shore ; his sister , whose screams alerted the dog , had not . " Norman swam after her , and my jaw just dropped , " says Annette .

" Gator Aid At 2:30 a.m. on Nov. 19 , 1993 , Gail Ennis was awakened by loud squawking coming from her 11-year-old African Grey parrot , Louie . Stumbling into the living room of her Delray Beach , Fla. , home to check the birdcage , she saw the reason for the bird 's alarm : the toothy grin of an alligator pressed against the window . Alarmed , Ennis , 54 , a homemaker , began calling 911 from the kitchen when she heard a pop . Turning around , she saw the gator-having pushed through the screen-roaming the house . " His mouth was wide open , and he hissed , " she recalls . Hearing the commotion , her husband , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bed and grabbed his .357 Magnum .

Though aflutter during the incident , Louie no doubt learned from the experience . Along with " good morning " and " good night , " he now repeatedly squawks , " It 's okay , it 's okay " - the words Gail used to soothe him after the incident . Trial by Fire After battling a blaze in an abandoned auto shop on March 29 last year , New York City firefighters were startled to hear meowing . There , amid the smoke , sat three crying kittens ; across the street were two more . Within moments , their mother , a badly injured calico , was found nearby . " She had done her job and pulled them out one by one , " says firefighter David Giannelli , who placed the animals in a box .
