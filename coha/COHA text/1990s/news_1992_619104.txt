<p> One year after Bill Honig coasted into a third term as superintendent of California schools , his reign as one of the nation 's most respected education leaders is being severely tested by an onslaught of legal challenges . <p> Honig 's troubles are distinct from his years of warring with former Governor George Deukmejian over the education budget or his sparring with the governor 's appointed state school board over classroom policy . <p> But his predicament  --  which already has forced the resignation of his wife , Nancy , as president of her nonprofit group , the Quality Education Project  --  has its roots in those very battles . <p> " He is head and shoulders above any state superintendent in the nation , " said Ramon Cortines , superintendent of San Francisco schools . " He is an advocate for education and a vociferous , tenacious advocate for the appropriate money . ( But ) there is no doubt that this type of thing hampers one 's effectiveness . You ca n't explain these types of situations away . " <p> Through a combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capitalize on those errors , Honig finds him self embroiled in a state criminal investigation , a federal audit alleging conflict-of-interest violations with the Quality Education Project , and a lawsuit against him by his own Board of Education . Outcomes of each are expected within the next several weeks . <p> Many educators believe that Honig will survive these challenges . To date , none of the cases has produced evidence of wrongdoing , despite nearly a year 's worth of inquiries . <p> Nevertheless , even Honig 's political supporters say the charges against him have damaged his credibility and hampered his ability to run the nation 's largest school system . Anticipating the end of an era , four key members of Honig 's inner circle all left the department within three months of one another this past fall . <p> Together , the accusations offer an unprecedented challenge to the integrity of the outspoken educator and unnerve supporters who want the superintendent intact for a major forthcoming battle against a school-choice initiative that seeks to use public education money for private-school tuition . <p> The distraction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's budding reform movement . Honig says he now is forced to spend about a third of his time just defending himself in these cases . <p> " It has me personally scared , " said Mike Kirst , former president of the Board of Education and now an education professor at Stanford University . " We need him . " <p> Honig said last week that he is unsure whether he will seek a fourth term in 1994 . State Senator Frank Hill , R-Whitter , for whom Honig has campaigned and with whom he has fought about education , said : " I think he 's very wounded . I think he 'll have a major challenge in the Democratic primary . There 's a real level of frustration out there . " <p> Already , the name of state Senator Gary Hart , D-Santa Barbara , chairman of the Senate Education Committee , has been floated as a possible challenger . " It 's an office that holds some interest for him , " said Joe Caves , Hart 's legislative aide . <p> Quietly , indirectly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat . Here are some of them : <p> * Conservative Christian groups , which hold great sway over the billion-dollar textbook industry , have been angry with Honig since at least 1989 , when he persuaded the state school board to expand the teaching of evolution in science texts . The Rev. Louis Sheldon , chairman of the pro- creationist Traditional Values Coalition , accused him of intimidating the board . <p> At the same time , the board showed its sympathy for the fundamentalists by removing references to evolution as scientific fact and banning the mention of a U.S. Supreme Court decision that questioned the validity of creationism . <p> * In 1987 , Assembly conservatives , who had halted state-mandated bilingual education , became furious when Honig sent a memo to districts that they said ignored the new rules . Hill , who was then an assemblyman , wrote a counter- memo denouncing Honig . <p> * Even traditional allies of Honig , such as the powerful California Teachers Association , dropped their support of him last year after a labor dispute . The fact that few friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant . <p> " There are a lot of enemies out there , " said Ralph Slynn , executive director of the California Teachers Union . " The textbook industry , for example , is big money and big ideology . It 's no wonder that he 's been a target . " <p> Others say Honig 's suggestion in 1988 that he might run for governor was enough to put his enemies on notice to try to oust him . <p> Honig , 6-foot-5 and lanky as a greyhound , is praised by educators in and out of California as an intelligent visionary who has managed to keep children 's issues consistently if uncomfortably at the top of the state agenda . The former corporate lawyer continually amazes those who send him their new research papers only to find he has already read them . <p> To many observers , the 54-year- old Honig presents a man straddling two worlds . A wealthy socialite with an elegant home in Pacific Heights , he holds an image that seems to be incongruous with the tenacious politician running through hallways issuing orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " He has carved out a direction that is being emulated by many other states , " said Susan Fuhrman , director of the Consortium for Policy Research in Education at Rutgers University . " He has set very high expectations and tied state policy to them . This is , believe it or not , a big change . " <p> During Honig 's decade in office , California has led the nation in education reform . The transformation includes whole districts using team-teaching techniques and coordinating lesson plans for math , language , social studies and sometimes even physical education . In many schools , teachers have demanded and earned greater decision-making powers . <p> As a co-author of Proposition 98 , California 's school-financing guarantee , Honig also led the fight against its suspension by the state Legislature . <p> " People ca n't understand why you 'd give your enemies a chance to go after you , " Honig said in a recent interview . " My response is , look  --  you 're not going to understand me unless you understand that my reason for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> But the very zeal that has earned him accolades from educators has irritated his opponents . <p> They cite test scores that have improved little since 1987 and low satisfaction with graduates among California employers . Just four of every 10 candidates for entry-level jobs at Pacific Telesis pass the entry exam , said Sam Ginn , chief executive officer and chairman of the education committee at the Business Round Table , an influential consortium of executives . <p> Often-heard complaints suggest that Honig 's attentions to his wife 's Quality Education Project have been excessive , inappropriate and possibly illegal . Yet Honig is unrepentant , even righteous , about touting the benefits of the program to encourage parent involvement in schools . <p> " People see him as a classy , public-spirited guy , " said one insider who did not want to be named . " But how do you justify to the average man in the street , whether true or not , a nonprofit program where your wife is making $ 108,000 a year ? It does n't sell in the post-Watergate era @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board of Education , either . <p> Trouble had been brewing a year ago between the board  --  Republican appointees of former Governor George Deukmejian  --  and Honig , a Democrat . The board could not get Honig to authorize salaries for a dozen people the board wanted to hire , including four secretaries , an attorney and a deputy to Honig himself . <p> Furthermore , the board did not like Honig 's directives to school districts , such as the one about bilingual education , and sought to preview all such memorandums . <p> In November , the state board became the first to sue a state superintendent , in an action that is expected to cost taxpayers $ 150,000 in private attorney 's fees . The matter is being heard by an appellate court in Sacramento . <p> It was in this contentious climate that the board asked Nancy Honig last February to explain the relationship of the Quality Education Project to the Education Department . <p> Board members knew that she ran the organization from the Honig home and paid rent for its space . They also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if not solely , on the advice of QEP on matters involving parental involvement . Most members were satisfied with Nancy Honig 's testimony . Joe Stein , now the board president , was not . <p> " I took it upon myself to write a letter to the Fair Political Practices Commission and ask for an investigation into this , " Stein said . <p> But the commission would not take the case . So Stein turned to Attorney General Dan Lungren , who has also supported fundamentalist causes such as school prayer , to launch a criminal inquiry into Honig 's activities . Lungren agreed , even conducting a surprise search of Honig 's home in October . <p> So far , the only indication of possible action against Honig is contained in a preliminary report by federal auditors , who are expected to recommend that the U.S. government require California to refund $ 222,590 that Honig allegedly allowed to be paid for salaries of four employees of the Quality Education Project . <p> Honig denies the charge and disputes the auditors ' allegation that he " used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence of QEP " by writing memos and issuing directives in support of the program . <p> But the appearance of trouble can be as damaging as actual misdeeds , educators say . <p> " I think this has damaged him , " said Mary Bergen , president of California Federation of Teachers . " He has to give a lot of time and attention to what 's going on here , and it does divert from the positive things that his department has been involved in . ( But ) we have a lot of politically motivated action going on  --  more than I 've seen in my lifetime . He probably should have kept a better eye on things . "
