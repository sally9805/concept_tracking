Section : THIS LAND <p> In 1935 , botanist Edward N. Transeau described patches of prairie found east of the Great Plains , in Michigan , Illinois , Indiana , and Ohio . He believed these isolated patches were remnants of what had once been an arm of prairieland , which he called the prairie peninsula . One of the easternmost of these patches , called Buffalo Beats , lies near Athens in southeastern Ohio , on land now part of Wayne National Forest . It is named for the American bison , which may well have grazed there when it roamed this part of Ohio . <p> I visited Buffalo Beats one warm May afternoon in the company of forest ranger Joe Newcomb and botanist Marilyn Ortt of the Ohio Heritage Program , an organization that assists the Forest Service in managing the prairie . After a short but steep climb through a dense forest of black , scarlet , and white oaks , we reached the top of a ridge where the forest ended abruptly and a half acre of prairie vegetation was exposed to sunlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloom , punctuated by an occasional splash of orange from false dandelions , yellow from cinquefoils , and gold from golden alexanders . Leaves of many other species were evident , some just beginning to unfold : blazing-star , yellow gentian , rattlesnake-master , stiff goldenrod , whorled rosin-weed , and the dominant grasses ( big blue-stem and Indian grass ) would be flowering vigorously by autumn . <p> Lifelong residents of the area recall that this forest opening existed during their childhood , and several botanists have traced its condition for more than half a century . Howard Wistendahl described Buffalo Beats in 1962 , when it covered about two acres . To help explain the presence of prairie plants in the heart of the predominantly oak forest , Wistendahl examined the soil . He noted that the dense forest , with its oaks and an understory of maple-leaved viburnum , grew on a light-colored , shaly soil , while the prairie had developed on a layer of dark red clay that was deposited several inches deep over the shaly soil . The clay held more water , provided more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil . <p> The clay was deepest at the center of the prairie and thinned out at its border . Wistendahl defined three zones of vegetation . The prairie , devoid of all trees , occupied the deeper red clay . A forest with an understory of mixed forest and prairie species grew where only a thin layer of red clay covered the shaly soil . Beyond this " transition zone " was the regular forest . <p> Two decades after Wistendahl 's work , Dennis Hardin restudied Buffalo Beats and discovered that the forest had encroached so much that only about a half acre of reasonably intact prairie remained . Even there , woodland trees , shrubs , and herbaceous plants were invading . Two prairie species , the whorled rosinweed and the milk spurge , had become more common , and several others , including the hairy sunflower , continued to flourish in the transition zone . But rarer prairie herbs had become still rarer , and big bluestem , the dominant prairie grass , had decreased from 50 percent of the cover to only 16 percent . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a management plan , which the Forest Service and the Ohio Heritage Program are now implementing . In early spring of 1986 , fifty trees with a diameter of six inches or more were cut down within the prairie and removed , along with some woody plants in the transition zone . One huge branch of an oak tree that extended halfway across the prairie was also pruned because the shade it cast encouraged the growth of forest species . These steps aided the growth of some prairie plants during the spring and summer but also brought an unwelcome influx of poison ivy , which , along with woody seedlings and stump sprouts , is now being weeded out periodically by hand . <p> Despite the increased exposure to sunlight following the tree cutting , many prairie plants in Buffalo Beats still did not flower or set seeds . As a further experiment , during the spring of 1987 the southern half of the prairie was burned . This triggered rattlesnake-masters , yellow gentians , hairy sunflowers , and stiff goldenrods to bloom profusely that summer and autumn , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The management team is reluctant to bum the entire prairie , however , for fear of destroying the insect population . Entomologists have found that Buffalo Beats is a haven for insects , including some very uncommon ones . Two species unique to the area seem to depend completely on the subulate phlox that grows there . <p> The questions of the origin and age of Buffalo Beats have intrigued botanists for years . In 1942 ecologist Paul Sears suggested that the warming trend that ended the last Ice Age some 12,000 years ago may have eventually rendered the climate in the eastern United States hotter and drier than it is today , allowing the development of Transeau 's " prairie peninsula . " But how can we tell whether Buffalo Beats is a remnant of this ancient prairie or a more recent colonization by prairie plants of an artificial forest clearing ? <p> A recently developed technique has helped resolve this question . Plants take up silicon from the soil and eventually deposit it in their leaves as granules of silicon dioxide known as opaline phytoliths . These microscopic phytoliths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants , may persist in the soil for as much as 13,000 years . Forest soil scientists P J. Kalisz and S. E. Boettcher took soil samples in and around Buffalo Beats and discovered that the phytoliths found in the prairie soil were almost exclusively from nonwoody , prairie-type species , while those in the transition zone were from a mixture of prairie and forest plants , and those in the forest soil were almost exclusively produced by trees . They concluded that the prairie had occupied the ridgetop for at least 13,000 years and probably once extended over what is now called the transition zone . <p> The existence of a virgin patch of prairie in this region is remarkable , considering that all other tillable tracts have at least been tried for agriculture . Marilyn Ortt has studied the ownership of the land as far back as the records go and found that except for an inconsequential three-day period , the land has belonged to absentee owners who were not around to farm this small parcel . Recently , in a fine . gesture of conservation , the Quaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beats , gave up its claim in an agreement signed with the Forest Service . As a result , there is renewed hope that the tiny prairie will be preserved for future generations .
