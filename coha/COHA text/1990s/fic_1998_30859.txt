Sometimes it 's the easy way that 's hard . Abra Lewis Dixon had carefully sculpted her exterior existence . She paid close attention to her physical environment  --  the trunk formation of a Japanese maple , the many red shades that came before its brilliant autumnal crimson . She regularly consulted her Farmer 's Almanac so she could better predict the weather ; she liked to be prepared . The interior stuff , however , was too unwieldy , unpredictable , and difficult . She left that unattended , willing herself to believe it insignificant . She sat at the oak vanity her mother had given her as a housewarming gift , looking at her reflection  --  so much like her mother 's  --  noticing for the first time that parentheses had formed around her mouth , adding to the diminutive lines under her eyes . Her skin was parched . She twisted open the gold-rimmed top on the heavy smoked-glass jar , scooping out a mound of precious skin cream with her finger , smoothing it over her cheeks , forehead . A different potion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Looking at herself again , waiting to see a change , Abra ran her fingers across the grooves of the antique vanity , the one she 'd always loved . She tried to imagine her face covered with wrinkles , her hair the color and texture of cotton , but she could n't . Childhood was much closer , a blink ago . When she was a child , she 'd lose herself at her mother 's vanity , playing in all her mother 's makeup and perfumed creams and fine talc in cardboard containers ; her neck wrapped with her mother 's best leopard-print silk-chiffon scarf and her pubescent face made up with lipstick , rouge , and Groucho Marx eyebrows . She 'd pulled herely one of the dozens of maintenance types married couples have all the time , mundane dialogues with mundane concerns : Do n't forget to go to the cleaners . Do we have any beer ? What are we doing this weekend ? This conversation was just to confirm that Cullen would meet her tonight at Sherry and David 's at seven . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Steptoe-Warrens were a significant part of Abra and Cullen 's social life , and , as often happened , the men ended up in one room ; the women in another . Abra and Cullen were friends of the Steptoe-Warrens and acquainted with the other regulars . There were friends and there were couple friends , who all got along as long as the evening 's subjects remained superficial . Abra sat in an ancillary room , a den off the living room , observing the men who spoke in loud Black American dialects reserved only for each other . She watched Ray through the glassless window in the living room as he talked about the Million Man March , acting out with his hands and arms the emotional impact of the event and what it had meant to him . " First , I was n't gon na go . Then I do n't know why , but that mornin ' I just jumped up , pulled on my jeans , and headed to First Baptist , where I knew I could jump on the van they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a semicircle of cane-backed chairs , ottomans , and a love seat , looked at him , nodding , understanding his feelings because they , too , had struggled with the idea of going . All of them , except Cullen , had decided finally to go , to make the emotional pledge with brothers from around the country , to atone , to do better by their families , even though every brother in this room was living America 's wet dream . These men were members of America 's upper class , the top 2 percent wage earners  --  going to work in thousand-dollar suits , doing deals in the high-seven and eight figures , living with their intact families in fantasy suburban spreads or enviable co-op apartments . They were all functioning schizophrenics , held master degrees in ruling-class customs , which meant checking anything ethnic at the door . All these men bonded on the duality issue . At their high-paying professions they had to do two jobs : the one they were hired to do and the other unspoken one  --  to adopt landed White-boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other cultural schizophrenics . " You know , it was like the greatest thing I could 've done , man . When the radio alarm went off that mornin ' , Coltrane was blowin ' and y'all know , to me he is what Jesus Christ is to Christians . I took that as a sign , " Ray said . The others were nodding between gulps of Cristal or Coronas with lime , snacking on bean dip , salsa , and blue corn chips , the precursors to the catered buffet dinner . Abra searched Cullen 's eyes to see if they revealed sadness for what he 'd missed . She did n't detect any . No one asked him if he 'd gone , and he did n't volunteer anything . Cullen graduated Howard , summa , a reformed nerd , and the most focused person she 'd ever met . Abra had recognized him as a swan even before he did , and now she was the envy of most women . " This White guy at my office asked me why I went . He said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shit , but he just could n't get what I 'd get outta somethin ' like the march , " said Ray , a tax lawyer at a Wall Street firm . " I told him , ' Man , you see me here , doin ' my thing , tryin ' to make partner , but when I walk outta here at night , I say a little prayer of thanks for the car service home . You know why ? ' I said to him . ' Cause I 'm a Black man first , and the moment my feet hit the pavement , the average White person out here is assumin ' I 'm gon na knock ' em over the head , and I ca n't get a cab . ' The dude kinda looked at me , like he was seein ' me for the first time , and he just nodded . I do n't know if he got what I was tryin ' to say , but I think he thought about it . " Sherry Steptoe and David Warren liked to entertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two other couples , like the Dixons , had opted for suburbia . Yet David , because of Sherry , held on to their life in the city . David and Cullen had gone to college together . David was a lawyer , but he worked for a record company , on its business side . He was nice but about as interesting as iceberg lettuce . Sherry , on the other hand , had a lively disposition and was a copywriter at the same record company , which is where she and David had met . She was unlike all the women David had gone out with , and she had a kid to boot , a child who was an infant when they first started seeing each other . David fell hard for Sherry and her son , and they got married at a small affair of about thirty people at a cafe in Greenwich Village . At the wedding Sherry could n't stop crying , and everybody said it was because she was still postpartum , but a few of the couple 's inner circle always wondered if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daddy . Sherry had told Abra that the main reason she did n't want to leave the city was that moving to suburbia would make David too central to her life , and s he did n't want that . In the city she still had all of her friends , her work , little Jack 's play groups , and enough distractions . In the suburbs she 'd become Jack 's mother , David 's wife , and then a career person . She ran her fingers through her thick red-brown hair and wrinkled her nose at the thought , " Eeooh , no thanks . " Abra , on the other hand , had gone peacefully into the land of leaf blowers because she did n't want to argue with Cullen , and he was central to her life . Where they lived would n't make a difference . Abra looked around the room at the other couples and tried to figure which ones were really in love and which ones had simply settled for the best deal . Ray and Hanna really loved each other , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall : Woody Allen stops and asks them what the secret to a happy relationship is . The woman says , " I 'm very shallow and empty and have no ideas and nothing interesting to say , " and the man says , " And I 'm exactly the same way . " Hanna was a dentist , " an orthodontist , " she would say . They were supposed to be waiting until she had established her practice before having kids , but now that Ray 's partnership looked like a done deal , he was putting pressure on her to quit and start a family . Bert and Lisa operated in parallel universes , with neither compromising courses . She was pregnant and telling everyone that as soon as she had the baby , they were getting divorced because Bert was disappointed in her . She had failed to live up to her resume , which was replete with Ivy League degrees , and she held a job about as well as a sieve holds soup . Bert was pissed and would tell anybody who 'd listen that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a siphon . Everyone felt sorry for them . After dinner , David and Sherry 's live-in , Consuelo , put coffee , tea , and assorted fruit tarts on the breakfront in the dining room . Abra was tired and did n't want coffee or tea , but she also never wanted to do anything to upset any custom  --  people drink coffee or tea after dinner  --  so she doused her coffee with Sambuca . She chewed a piece of the blueberry tart and watched Lisa and Bert go at it over when Lisa should begin her maternity leave . Abra looked over to give Cullen the " exit " sign , but he was in rapt discussion with David . She could n't hear what they were talking about , but they both looked serious . She guessed accurately that they were discussing work , complaining about the demands . They were leaning against a built-in mahogany bookcase . Cullen looking fresh out of business school , wearing his English loafers , button-down , oxford-cloth shirt rolled up to the elbows , and blue-and-green rep tie loosened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and their life together she was and pitied Lisa and Bert for not knowing what marital bliss felt like . " So how 's the dessert ? " Sherry asked , sitting down next to Abra and cutting off a piece of strawberry-kiwi tart . " Great . Did Connie make them ? " " Nah , I picked them up at Pascal 's . So how 's the business going ? " She pulled her chair closer . " Good , at least the TV part is . We 've got a film script in circulation , but so far , no bites . " " Now Natasha does just the film part in L.A. ? " " No , she runs the TV production stuff , too . We both do TV and film . I go out there as often as she needs me to , and she comes here sometimes . Actually she 's coming in tomorrow . " " So is s he more the creative ... " " Kind of . I 'm in charge of more of the business . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people think it 's stupid , " Abra said . " Anybody in this room ? " Sherry smirked and looked in Cullen 's direction . " No , I 'd be surprised if he could even tell you the name . " " Hmm , is there trouble in paradise ? " " No , not at all , I just know that my business is not at the top of my husband 's agenda . In his mind , he 's the breadwinner and my work is like the Junior League , " Abra said . " Puhleeze , these guys , " Sherry said , then sipped her tea . " I 'm exaggerating , slightly , but it does n't bother me . " " Well , you 're a better woman than me . " " Look , we 're talking about ten years together . We 've got this massive house to decorate , we 're trying to have a baby , his making partner , me running a business  --  there 's only so much my little sweetie can deal with at once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the coffee table . " You should have a party for your anniversary , I mean ten years  --  " " Ten total , together . We 've been married almost five . " " Whatever . It 's still nothing to sneeze at . I 'm not sure we 'll make three . " She laughed a hollow laugh and Abra smiled sympathetically . " My wedding day was the happiest day of my life , " Abra said . " You really love Cullen , huh ? " Sherry asked , looking at Abra as if she 'd just revealed a row of jack-o ' - lantern teeth . " Yeah , I do . He 's the most important thing to me . " " You 're lucky . " " I know . " " Most married people I know are just , you know , going through the motions . Like look around this room . " " Sherry , you really think that ? " " I know that . The women probably would n't have gotten married at all . " Abra lo oked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through their eclectic home , which they had filled with antiques and African art . The picture of Buppie perfection . How could they not be happy ? It was predestined , like DNA  --  these were the people happiness was meant for . Cullen tapped Abra on her shoulder , and Sherry got up . " You ready to go ? " he said , sitting down in Sherry 's chair . Abra leaned toward him and kissed him with an open mouth . She held his face in her hands . " Do you know how much I love you ? " " Um , I think so . How much have you had to drink ? I saw you hittin ' that Sambuca . " " I 'm not drunk . I just love you . " Cullen shifted in his seat , hoping no one was watching them . He was n't one for PDA . " Me too . You ready to go ? " " More than , " she said , and smiled a lecherous smile . Abra ran her hand over his thigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was sensuous . They said good night to Sherry and David at the elevator and walked the few blocks to the garage , holding hands . " You know we have an anniversary coming up ? " Abra said . " Course . " " So do you want to go away or do something ? " " Well , sweetie , I would , but I do n't think I 'll be able to get away right now . Things are really busy and  --  " " I know not now , but what about in a few weeks ? Maybe we can go back to St. Bart 's ? " " Ah , that would be great . We 'll see , okay ? " The attendant pulled the car around , Cullen tipped him , and Abra got into the driver 's seat . She checked her flawless lipstick in the rearview mirror before she drove off . " Did you have a good time ? " Cullen asked , changing the radio to the all-business news station . " Yeah I did , but I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I know . I feel sorry for him . " " What about her ? " " Well , they 're both our friends . " " I know . I just want everybody to be happy . Do you think the others are happy ? " " About what ? " " Their lives ? Their relationships . " " Why would n't they be ? They have everything , they 're successful . What could be wrong ? " " Well , Sherry 's not in love with David , and Hanna and Ray , well they 're in love , I suppose . " " Well , there you have it ; two out of four are good marriages . We 're the cultural norm . " Abra steered the 740 onto the West Side Highway and switched on a Will Downing CD . Cullen had leaned back onto the headrest and would be asleep within seconds . Abra bobbed her head to Will Downing 's crooning as it washed over the percussion . She looked over at Cullen sleeping , his mouth open , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd structured her life , and it was as close to perfection as possible . Theirs was one of the two good marriages . She let that reassure her on the drive home .
