1 . WHERE WE WERE We were in bed We were sauced We were plastered We were stoned We were drumming floors We were bathed in TV light We were alive We were together We were back in the world . * And she 's still not used to the noises he makes in other rooms . She hears him pacing the floor and snapping his fingers as if he ca n't contain the ideas popping into his head . Dropping the green cotton skirt over her silky green blouse , she thinks it 's crazy , dressing up this way to watch TV , but Rooster will twirl her around , three times at least , like she was the main show and he wo n't let it end . Before him , men were so ordinary , so predictable . He surprises her breath away , driving them into Manhattan at 3:00 A.M. , the tall glass buildings filled with blue light and no people , his arm wrapping her waist . He never lets her stray from his side . Back home , they sneak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bed till noon , their bodies tight together . It worries her the way he can go on with no sleep , expecting her to do the same , although when she ca n't he leaves her be , takes off by himself . Once they 're married he 'll settle down . He 's just excited , the way she is , about everything . Yesterday she missed her morning classes and arrived in a daze at the afternoon workshops , where the teacher was shagging hair . In the evening she found the time to perm the wig on her mannequin , which used to reside on the kitchen table until Rooster covered it and moved it to the window ledge . The eye sockets gave him the creeps . Soon she 'll graduate and look for a full-time job . Rooster too . Then they can rent a place , their own , maybe buy it someday , and he can listen to music all night if he wants to . She weaves the last strands of her hair into a French braid , and with arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Listen up , men , he 'll say , Millie and I are getting married . She opens the closet door , studies the shoe rack . They agree , today is perfect for the announcement . They 'll all be together . He 'd better remember . She searches out her beige , high-heeled pumps . * He counts twenty-two steps from the bedroom door to the end of the living room . If he walks across the couch , it 's only nineteen . He glances out the window . Looks like an afternoon storm that could last minutes , or days . No use trying to keep dry . The heavens are tricky . The key is not to care . He switches on a lamp in the rapidly darkening room . Listens for the drumbeat of Millie 's heels . She does n't like him barging in while she 's dressing . She says that he 's got to give her some privacy . Soon there 'll be thunder , lightning . He begins snapping his fingers . Twenty-two steps . He turns , fixes his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anchors need to be close to their boats . He switches on another lamp , drops into a chair . A thunderclap rumbles deep in his chest . This vessel 's ready to steer out of here . He stands up . Twenty-two steps . He looks for a magazine . None in sight . He glances out at the yellow house across the street . A patch of grass black as the sky . He flicks on the TV . Nothing . Goddamn box . Not even plugged in . Jesus . He ca n't be prowling around looking for a socket . Shit . Twenty-two steps . He opens the bedroom door . " Hey , baby . " She 's slipping on her shoes . He wraps his arms around her , nuzzles his face into her clean-smelling hair . Make love , he thinks , so deep inside he 'll hear nothing but the feathery sounds that come off her breath . " Do n't mess me . " He unzips her skirt . " You ca n't be messed , baby . " " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late . They 're always late . " He sits her on his lap . " Pretty bird , why should we ever leave this room ? " He slips off the barrette , begins unbraiding her silky , orange-red hair that 's like a morning sun , a ' Nam moon . He traces the line of freckles marching down her neck . " We need to count these . " He peers into her green saucer eyes scattered with infinite black and yellow specks . " Tiger eyes . " " Ever see one ? " " Heh , heh . They saw me . " He lifts her blouse over her head . " Do n't undress me anymore . " She shakes her shoulders . " Why not ? " He lays her on the bed , sliding up beside her . " Do n't you want to go the party , Rooster ? " His name , that name , still so strange from her lips . " We will . I 'll dress you . " " Let 's not be late . They 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Filled with the after-sweet tiredness of loving her , he might be able to sit still for the car ride . " Right . Ca n't expect him to leave the bubble till the bluebird flies through Manhattan . " " He 's home as long as you are . " " Maybe yes , maybe no . " " Riddles again . " " But you understand them . " " Do I ? " " I 'm the middle of the riddle and you 're marrying me anyway . " " Be serious . " " Serious is a hole in the hourglass . " Her pale brows create little frown lines like a puppy 's , low on her forehead . He needs to take her with him into oblivion . He rubs the back of his hand on her soft cheek . " I 'd rather do carefree . " " You need to do something . " " Yeah , something . " " Like school . The government will pay . " " They ca n't pay me what they owe me , sweet bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's over for you . Forget it . " " Forgotten , baby , like old garbage . It just stinks , that 's all . Hey , I 've got it figured : you 're a beautician , so I 'll be a barber . We 'll open a shop , serve bubbly while we cut , and charge the men extra for seeing you . Except no grunts . " His fingers play along her arm . " How come ? " " They need the hair . To cover their mugs , the shaggy bastards . " She lifts his beard . " Nothing hidden there . " " You smell so good . " He presses himself against her softness . One hand finds the knob of her hipbone , holding on not to glide away . " Whatever you want , " he whispers , not sure why . " Do you mean it ? " " You name it , " he whispers again . " I want a house someday . " " One place for the rest of your life ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why not ? " " What about camping out ? " " Once in a while . " " With just sleeping bags . " " Okay . " " Good . Because I saw this large estate in South Hampton . We could set up a hooch facing the water , cook on the beach . No one 's there after October . " " But we 'll be working then . " " It 's our shop . We 're the bosses . We can take our vacations when we want . " He slides back up and looks into round , flecked eyes full of doubt . " Smile , Millie . What 's the worst thing that could happen ? " His lips on hers , searching for the immediate warmth . * " Jason , Jason , " he chides himself . " Caught short , man , short . " He spreads the green , heart-shaped dexies on the kitchen table . Chips on a bingo card , except they cover only four spaces and he has twenty-four hours to get through before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Damn . Damn . Contact 's got to be made before tomorrow . He ca n't interview for anything on nothing . Wo n't be easy . Man does n't live normally , has no phone , does n't take checks . Pray he gets his message at the rug store and arrives with a pocketful in the morning . He 'll borrow some cash from his sister . Ida 's shy on asking questions . Not Deede , though . A hint 'll get you a million from her . He 'll head for Manhattan before dawn , before she wakes , leave a note saying he went to Jones Beach . Not much of a lie . They should never have downpaid on this place . No one scores an easy hit in the burbs . Except Deede hates the city . Whatever will he do later ? Not even one downer . Shit ! He 'll be wearing eyeballs all night . He 'll never kick the habit of staying alert in the dark . Thank the good Buddha for Rod 's party . Watergate Party . Beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows what the men need . If he tips enough sauce , that 'll wipe out hours , and Frankie 's driving both ways . Once they took care of each other . Now they 're in separate holes . Fear opened them up . All those nights he talked away , confessing whatever lay on his chest . Like him rummaging that dead boy 's body , still warm . What did he expect to find ? A worthless photo that he 'll never show to Deede . It might scare her , maybe away from him . Then where would home be ? He slides two pills into his palm . Studies them . He 'll do these , then at two the next , and at five the final one . That should take care of the light time . He has to think strategically . No , that 's the LT 's job . His is to get through . He takes the OJ out of the fridge , swallows the pills , and drinks until the pulpy , acidic taste clogs his throat . Shit ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letting the place rot . He glances at floor , walls , window . Immaculate . The way he likes it . No , she 's okay . Her footsteps overhead . He wads the remaining two pills into a Kleenex and slips it in his pants pocket . He ca n't stay here , waiting to lift off . He advances on the stairs . " Deede ? Deede ! " " What ? " He catches the urgency in his voice , sits down on a step . His eyes sweep the orderly living room . Calm , man , be calm . Not a mansion , but nifty . Fixed up just the way he wants . No greens . No earth colors at all . Sky , sun , and water , he told her , he can live with that . Yeah , he 's starting to feel it . Only a little rush , but it 's there . He stands . " I 'm coming to get you . " She 's there at the top in her little-boy pajamas . " Hey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You want to keep Frankie 's motor running ? " She slips her arms around his neck . " I want to talk about the party . " " Not again , come on . " " You 're going to booze away the hours . " " We 're going to sit in Rod 's new house and watch Nixon 's ass get whipped by the little pricks who worked for him . " She pushes past him . " I need a cup of coffee . " Light as a feather , strong as a horse . He follows her small , lithe body into the kitchen . She fills the kettle , flips on the gas . Quick , sharp movements . He glimpses her smooth olive cheeks , full pink lips . The girl does n't need an ounce of makeup . " I 'll have one , too , thick . " " It 's too early for espresso . " " Not for me . " She checks out the dewy shine in his eyes , the red patches on his cheeks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets stoned nowadays , she reminds herself . At least his hair is n't down to his ankles or crawling all over his face like the others . " Let me help . " He comes up behind her . If they make love , he might consider forgetting the damn party . They can watch those clowns on their own TV . Actually , they do n't have to leave the house at all . She relaxes against him . " Want to skip the coffee ? " She gyrates her hips . " Just phone them . " " And say what ? " He drops the question into her hair . " I do n't know . That we were out late , ca n't make it . " She slides her arm around his waist . " They 'll be disappointed . " Still whispering . " Tell them we 'll get together soon . Let 's go to bed , just for a while . You know we have n't loved for a few days . " She beams at him . Maybe a quickie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll take a lifetime to coax him hard now . Besides , he needs the men today . " It 's already set up , sweetheart . We have to be there . " He kisses her cheek , then carefully moves away . With one hand balled into a fist , she counts out spoonfuls of coffee . Why does she bother ? He 's on his way , that 's for sure . The party will finish him , damn them all . " Play and noise . A whole day of it . I ca n't take it that long . " " Then have a few drinks . That 's what parties are for . " " I do n't like whiskey . " She sits across from him at the table , staring . " Smoke some dope . Lift off , just for an hour . Look down on the everyday shit . " He reaches for her hand , turns it palm up . " See that life-line , that 's money in the bank . The question is : how are you going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bank . " " We 're talking life-lines here . " The kettle screams . He jumps up , knocking the chair . Catches it just in time . " Shut that fuckin ' thing off . " She darts to the stove , kills the flame , pours the boiling water into the espresso pot . " I 'm sorry . " His face flushed , his mouth a thin , tight line . " I 'm sorry . " She says it in a voice meant to keep him calm . " Soon as it cools , the kettle 's gone , " she croons . " I 'll turn on some music . We 'll get in a party mood , okay ? We 're going to Rod 's , are n't we ? " She reaches out for him . " Yeah , right , " he mumbles , stepping back . " Sure as shit . " She straightens the chair . " Go on , hurry , get dressed . " She nods , watching him , then runs up the stairs . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of scotch from the cabinet . There 's only an inch left . He meant to save it for tonight . He tips the bottle to his mouth . The liquid burns a path down his throat . He pours espresso into a mug , pulls out the tissue , pops the remaining pills , drinks them down with sips of too-hot coffee . The kettle ruined his high . He needs to start again . * Goddamn Chevy in front is crawling , and the road 's too narrow to pass . Maybe he 'll let Ida take the wheel . She 's not a fan of his driving anyway . Probably he wo n't , probably he 'll keep her near him so he can smell her sweetness , see her soft roundness under her light summer dress . He 's the one with the edges . Right , Papa-san ? He wo n't mention the truck to her , not yet . Independent movers rake in shitloads of money . The lifting , carrying , that 'll be easy . Getting caught in traffic jams , that might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash than he 's ever had . Now he has zilch , plus a truck . The first cross-country trip , he 'll take Ida . They 'll sleep in motels , cheap , cozy , clean , with pictures on the walls that have no meaning , and neighbors who have no names . She 'll like that . With her brother out of the house , the place is finally hers ; and he knows what 's coming , it 's natural , healthy , everyone 's next step . But he ca n't marry , ca n't even move in . The sweet , loving nights spent with her , and he 's awake until dawn , then guns the car onto the expressway , windows rolled down , doors unlocked , speeding past all possibility of surprise . The car in front is taking its Sunday-school time . He presses the horn and does n't let up either . At least he 's out of the old drunk 's place now . What a pair they make . Him waking up screaming from a nightmare , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When Pauli was there , they ignored the old man , or tried to . He glances at the look-alike houses creeping by . Somehow , wherever his sister is , he knows she would n't live around here . The last time he saw Pauli , that night before he left , a bad scene . She , trying to talk him out of it . His father yelling , " Frankie will do like other boys . " She , stubborn . " I do n't want some shiny-faced soldier handing me a flag . We can help you . " Which was all his father needed . " We can help you ? Who do you think you are , Ladybird ! " She , pronouncing each word as if it were a warning . " You do n't have to go . We have ways . " " Jail ? " She , laughing . " I counsel men like him all week , strangers who will live , and not in jail either . " Her hand trying to find his . " Your coward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the rest of his life . " " He does n't have to be like you , a little man afraid of everything ! " The old drunk flinging her past the couch . She , lifting herself to her feet , and leaving with one last pleading look back at him but not a word . Them , fighting over him like two dogs over raw meat . He , following the arrows to the Jersey buses , hoping she 'd turn up to say good-bye , walking down a dimly lit staircase , through a door , into the gray dawn . Jesus , it was cold . He still remembers the little dance he was tapping out to keep warm when the door opened . Not Pauli , but a husky kid with wild yellow curls around a big , baby face . " Fort Dix ? " the kid asks . " Yeah . " " Bus must be late , not that I care . If it never comes , ca n't go . Simple logic . The way I see it . We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who to take . I mean , this could be the beginning of the end of our lives . So what 's the rush ? Simple logic . The way I see it , it 's not Germany or Italy . It 's tiger and monkey land . " The bus like the rush of Rod 's words crashing down the ramp just to get them . And anything slower still makes him crazy . He wonders if Rod even remembers that ride . He pokes his head out the window . The empty road is there somewhere . He may have to flatten a few lawns to get to it , but once he does , he can pedal the gas , lift the pressure off his head . Anyway , he ca n't be dawdling , Papa-san , Ida 's waiting , his buddies , too . The good people , not the fools , liars , and jerk-offs . He 's riding the Chevy 's bumper at minus ten miles an hour when suddenly it stops . His foot smashes the brake . A dog loping across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Still , man , be still , " he mutters . Hey , Papa-san , what do I do ? The Chevy creeps forward again , shining a spiteful chrome smile back at him . He strains to catch the image that pops into his head , but it 's gone before he can grasp it , leaving only the terror , and the question -- where will he be when it shows up again . The tremors are in his arms now , his body no longer listening to reason . He pulls the car over , jumps out , begins humping toward Ida 's place . Pay attention , Papa-san , remember where we parked . * Emma does a slow turn in the middle of the living room . New beige carpet , new blue couch , new coffee table , new chairs , new nineteen-inch TV inside its sleek black console . And it scares her -- all of it -- because nothing has prepared her for luck . Not even Rod coming home intact . It 's the whole cake , plus a well-stocked freezer . She 's never owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a downstairs , even a basement that Rod 's father plans to finish . And she believes him , too . He 's a builder by nature as well as by trade , like Rod . And easy to keep books for . She makes no mistakes . Yesterday , when she pointed out an error on an invoice , it was as if she 'd given him a gold brick , not a few extra dollars . " Emma ? Where is anything ? " Rod stands at the head of the stairs , naked , a towel around his neck . " I had a system with all the boxes . " " In closets . " " My fatigues do n't like closets . " " What exactly are you looking for ? " " Maybe a T-shirt ? " " In the chest of drawers , top one 's yours . " " We 're not sharing our drawers ? " He flips off the towel , slides it around his waist . " Come here , do the dance . " She shakes her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big , black-lettered sign : SPILL A DRINK AND DIE ! FILTHY SHOES OFF THE COUCH ! NO JUMPING ON FURNITURE . OR ELSE ! ! ! But they wo n't listen to orders or follow instructions . She 'll have to watch Ida 's brother carefully , Jason can get out of control , Rooster , too . Frankie worries her the least . She gazes at the maple tree , their maple tree , hers , which will turn red and yellow in the fall , so they say . It 's beautiful to stand here when it gets dark outside and the house is lit around her . While Rod was away she never chain-locked the apartment door . In case he arrived while she slept . The silliness of it often struck her , but she did n't dare change lest the gods take it out on him . She still leaves a night lamp burning to appease them . She 's too happy . Anything could happen . Her eyes slide down the quiet street . Their raucous coming will leave its imprint . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and tugs her toward the chair . " Worrying that the men will forget this is our house and lay waste . " " Not funny . " She straddles his lap , facing him . " It 's nice of us to have everyone visit . I mean , we spent a pretty penny for the food and I do n't even know what you paid for the booze . " " Does n't matter . They 've earned the best , and I aim to please . Give a kiss . " She brushes his forehead with her lips . His face is amazingly round . His blond hair unbelievable . The only blond in his family . " Where 'd you come from , " she whispers . " Listen , no tours of the house , okay ? " " Why ? " " Makes me uncomfortable . " " But they 've never seen it before . " " Yeah , well , it 's just a house . Wait until they get their own . " " Then turn on the hearings now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movies . " The beeping horn sends her off his lap . " Shut them up ! " She pushes him toward the door . She does n't even know the neighbors yet . In the vestibule , she hears Rod shouting , " This way , men ! " " A palace , son , " Rooster says , peering over his granny glasses . " My man here 's a sultan and I see the grapes . " He nudges Frankie toward the bar that Rod 's set up on the coffee table . Ida kisses her cheek , squeezes her hand , whispers " Looks nice . " Ida 's brother clicks the TV on . " Where are the little shits ? " Jason begins switching from channel to channel . " Wait a long minute . " Rooster drops onto the floor near Millie . " Give the boys time for nature 's calling . " Jason reaches for the scotch bottle . She moves to lower the volume . " Hey , Emma , no can make out . " Jason turns it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Not now , sweetheart . " " Find Jason the hearings , " Deede says . " Man can discover such things for himself , " Rooster mutters . " Emma , how big are these digs ? " Frankie asks . " Three bedrooms upstairs , plus what you see down here . " Rooster whistles . " This is the place for all good men to come to the aid of their friends , " Rod recites . " Who needs another scotch ? " Jason holds up his already empty glass . " Not you , " Deede mutters . " Man must do what he must do . " Rooster passes Jason a new glass . " What I do , I do well . " Jason pours a heavy couple of inches into Rooster 's glass and his own . " Ought to hire yourself out as a bartender . " " He 'll do better than that , " Deede says . " He has an interview at a bank tomorrow . " " No shit . " Frankie toasts him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program , " Deede replies . " My brother 's very versatile , " Ida tells them . " Jason 's been the banker for every crapshoot I won . " Frankie drops a short laugh . " He needs no training . " " It does n't translate into civilian life , " Rod says seriously . " Nothing does , my man . " " We 're talking jobs , " Deede snaps , " maybe even becoming a manager . " " You 're talking jobs , sweetheart . Me , I 'm having an interview . Hey , what 's this ? " Jason turns the volume up another notch . " General Hospital , " Millie says . " It 's depressing . Turn it off . " " Ca n't . Have to locate Nixon 's men . " Jason places his glass on top of the set and once again switches channels , stopping nowhere . " Man 's in an inquiring mood , " Rooster quips . " Someone please find Jason the hearings . " Emma 's voice echoes in her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud . Rod throws her a disapproving glance , like she 's the crazy one . Maybe she is , maybe she 's gotten herself a role in a fantasy she never auditioned for . She kneels in front of the set . If she can find the hearings , perhaps it 'll calm them down . " Wait , do n't make them disappear . " Jason 's at her side . " It 's just some soap opera , " she whispers . " Yeah , but that 's the channel we want . " Stubborn as a child . " Nixon 's men are on their way . " He sits back and stares into the screen . " Why in hell would you want to see a bunch of ugly men when we have such lovely ladies right here ? " Frankie nods in Ida 's direction . " We 're a sight better than Nixon 's flunkies . " Millie tosses back her head . " Besides , why spend good time on bad people ? " " Especially when you have zilch in common with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " Rod pats his butt . " They 've got fat wallets . " " They 're going to be out on the streets real soon , " Ida says . " But , hey , who cares ? " " Even so , " Rod continues , " nobody 's going to pick their pockets . They 'll never have to worry about money . " " Correct , " Deede snaps . " Unlike you guys . " " These men can hold their own with the best of them . " Millie kisses Rooster 's cheek . " The woman speaks the truth . " " Go ahead , put down what you ca n't have , " Deede says . " What 's that ? " Ida asks . " Money , honey , no doubt there . " Rod refills Frankie 's drink . " And trouble . Nixon 's men got trouble , now , " Rooster adds . " Who gives a shit . " Jason shrugs . " True , fella , those men have not earned our concern . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rooster , " Millie chides , " we 're not watching the hearings yet . " " I bet I can find those shits on my TV , something 's wrong with yours . " " Drunk already . " Deede shakes her head . " We are the way we are , " Jason tells her . " High but mighty . " Rooster flaps one arm . " Down and out , " Deede mumbles . " That reminds me ... where 's Sean ? " Frankie asks . Deede shrugs . " Closeted with Tess is my guess . " " Incapacitated , " Jason adds . " Wrong word , right thought . " Rooster grins . " Deede gave him Tess , and they are busy , busy , " Jason says . " Busy ? " Emma mutters half to herself , her stomach beginning to churn at the idea of two more people , two strangers , coming here . " In bed , Emma , like the world 's their playpen . " Deede shakes her head . " You gentle ladies are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , my man , we are on their sides , a better place to be . " Emma scans the room . Jason 's still staring at the tube . Frankie has his leg draped over the arm of her favorite beige chair . On the floor Rooster and Millie already lie spooned together . But she 'd take it . Right now . Just the way it is . If only she could freeze them here for the rest of the day . " Everything 's new , " comes out of her mouth . They all look at her . They 're waiting for the joke , she thinks . And if she knew one , she 'd tell it , put them at their ease , especially Rod . But joking 's not her style . Besides , their laughter 's too close to hysteria to be real , and it makes her anxious that Rod will forget he 's a normal , married man with responsibilities . A house , a wife , and more to come . It 's what she wants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes her hand , tugs her out of the room , though not before she hears Jason 's whoop as he recognizes someone , God knows who , on the TV . Following Ida upstairs , she wonders if Rod will miss her . Probably he 'll be relieved without her scrutiny . Tonight , though , tonight in the darkness , then he 'll seek her out . She pushes open the newly sanded bedroom door , pulls a small folding chair close to the window , where she can see the maple tree , the quiet street , the hot , white sky . " They wo n't miss us for a while , " Ida says , dropping into the rocking chair , stretching out her long legs until her bare feet rest on the bed . " I was thinking the same . " " They may even calm down . We 're their audience . We listen , clap , laugh at their antics . On the other hand , maybe they wo n't even notice we 're gone .
