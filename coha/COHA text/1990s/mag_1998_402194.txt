News reports warn us that African-American men are , on average , among the least healthy groups in the world . " For all the medical breakthroughs we have seen in the past century , we still see significant disparities in the medical conditions of racial groups in this country , " says David Satcher , M.D. , Ph.D. , assistant secretary for health and U.S. surgeon general . " This is particularly true among Black men . " Consider these facts : * 1n 1996 , Black men in the United States could expect to live , on average , for 66 years , while the life expectancy for White men was 73.6 years ; for Black women , it was 74.2 years . * Today an estimated 1 in 50 Black men are infected with HIV compared with 1 in 250 White men . * 1frican-American men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , poverty , poor access to health care and other social ills contribute to Black men 's inferior health status , but complacency is a factor as well . Like most men , my friends and I do n't get regular physicals . Many of us do n't have our own doctors , and we get checkups only when our aches and pains become impossible to ignore and we are coaxed into getting help-usually by our women . But we can surmount the statistics . Health experts such as Satcher say the problems that afflict Black men can be prevented through lifestyle changes . To help the men in your life take better care of themselves , offer your encouragement , along with the following information on four major ills brothers face : Heart Attack Triggered by an insufficient blood supply to the heart , heart attack is the number one cause of death for men and women .

" Prepare meals that are low in fat and high in fiber , " Douglass says . " That means less meat and more grains . " So cut back on " soul foods " that tend to be heavy in fat , meat and salt ; replace them with five servings of fruits and vegetables per day . * 1et some exercise-together . " We must develop an environment where exercise is part of our culture , " says Douglass .
