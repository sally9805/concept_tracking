<p> IN the window at Central Fish Company on Ninth Avenue lies the produce of the sea . Tiny cockles peek through the mounds of ice , as if buried in sand . Hulking catfish glare at the neat rows of shimmering sardines , and clams are piled up like rocks . At the center of this ordered tableau is a single glistening wild striped bass  --  more than two feet long  --  regally posed , a prince of the Atlantic . <p> Its placement in the display is well deserved . The wild striped bass has long been the prize of sport fishermen , a moneymaker for commercial fishermen and the darling of chefs . <p> But just a decade ago , you could n't have found a wild striped bass at Central Fish , or at any market in New York City . Low stocks of the fish and the presence of toxic substances in local waters had led to a ban on commercial fishing for the bass . It was a low point for one of the most revered fish in the Atlantic , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the same brutish vigor it uses to wrestle a fisherman on the line , the wild striped bass came back . " I was relieved and excited to see it , " said Rick Moonen , the chef at Oceana , on West 54th Street . " I missed it . " Its resurgence is so strong that in 1996 more wild striped bass were spawned in the Chesapeake Bay than in any other year since records were first kept in 1954 . And right now , both fishermen and cooks are more optimistic about the prospects for the fish than they have been in decades . Byron Young , a marine resources specialist for the New York State Environmental Conservation Department , sees the striped bass as the hero of " one of the good-news stories in fisheries these days . " <p> While it was gone , a farmed variety of the wild striped bass  --  which is called , simply , striped bass , while the real thing is always designated wild  --  tried to pick up the slack but without much success . The farmed bass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is actually a hybrid , a combination of white and striped bass that lacks much of the character of the wild fish . <p> Plenty of restaurants serve the farmed version hoping that customers wo n't notice the difference . But the farmed version is about as close to the wild as a dog is to a wolf . <p> The real thing , which is sometimes called a striper , linesider or rockfish , is unmistakable . It is not just a large fish , but also a beefy one , marked with strong black stripes that seem carefully stitched on , stretching from behind its gills to its tail . <p> Among its beastly peers like monkfish and tuna , it is a beautiful specimen . And yet it has a rugged edge , suggesting that it has been raised in rough waters . You can taste its story in its succulent flesh : it takes on the sweetness of the fresh river waters where it is spawned , salinity from the ocean and meatiness from muscling its way down the Eastern coastline . <p> In the 1960 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chefs in New York . For them , its texture and flavor provided an American equivalent for the loup de mer , a firm-textured , white-fleshed fish , and the bar raye , a Mediterranean relative of the bass with a smaller body but similar shape . <p> At La Caravelle on West 55th Street , Roger Fessaguet , who was then the chef and an owner , would poach one whole nearly every day for the lunch service , presenting it to diners on a cart with green sauce or mayonnaise . Nearby , at La Cote Basque , wild striped bass and salmon would be poached for lunch , too . " It sold like crazy , " said Mr. Moonen , who began his career at La Cote Basque . <p> Even today , with a much greater variety of fish available , the wild striped bass is regarded as one of the greatest fish in the Atlantic . " There are few fish that really belong to the upper caste , " said Daniel Boulud , the chef at Daniel , on East 76th Street . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joins , on his list , black sea bass , arctic char , tuna and red snapper . <p> If it were not for conservationists , though , stocks of the fish could have been wiped out . Through the 1970 's , wild striped bass were harvested with almost no restrictions . " Anything that would be taken in a net or fit on a hook was killed , " said John Field , a species coordinator with the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission . The bass were overfished and caught very young  --  some as small as 12 inches  --  causing the population to dip severely . <p> In 1981 , the commission took action , forming a management plan to rebuild the stock . But then New York 's fishery was struck another blow . Traces of polychlorinated biphenyls , the chemical contaminants known as PCB 's , were found to be on the rise in the Hudson River and waters surrounding Long Island . The State Environmental Conservation Department abruptly shut down commercial fishing for the bass , imposing a ban that lasted from 1986 to 1989 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in lesser-known fish , like skate and monkfish . So they moved on , dropping the wild striped bass from their menus as if it had become extinct . <p> The hiatus proved useful for the wild striped bass . It was able to reproduce freely , and its stock revived . In all areas except the Hudson , New York Harbor and western Long Island Sound , PCB levels were brought under control and the fish was deemed safe to eat once a week . <p> Today , fishing for the bass has become an entirely different business . The free-for-all days are over : strict size limitations , which vary by state ( 18 inches and up ) , are being enforced , along with quotas . <p> " It 's a high-profile fishery , " said Michael Terrell , an environmental conservation officer for New York State , who tracks down poachers . " The population is being re-established , and we are keeping close tabs on them . " <p> Coastal states from Massachusetts to North Carolina  --  with the exception of Connecticut , New Jersey and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allocated quotas for the number of bass that can be harvested . Last year , under New York State 's quota , only 45,397 were taken by commercial fishermen . <p> Seasons differ from state to state , beginning earlier in the North and ending later in the South . In New York , the commercial season for wild striped bass is July 1 to Dec. 15 , but for the consumer the season goes on . As the harvest moves down the coast , the availability of the bass extends year round , with the leanest period being March through June , the spawning period . Now , for instance , fish markets around the city are carrying stripers from Maryland , Virginia and North Carolina , where the season is still open . <p> And at all times , the farmed impostor is available in just about every fish store . But some fish experts are concerned about what they see as deceptive labeling . " It 's really false advertising , " said Mr. Young of the State Environmental Conservation Department . " It 's not a wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller  --  one to two pounds , as opposed to an average six to eight pounds for the wild  --  but the aquaculture striped bass , which has scattered rather than solid lateral lines , also happens to be a hybrid . The farmed version is a genetic wonder . It has the growth rate of a white bass , which means it can reach market size ( 12 to 14 inches ) in less than a year , a length that would take two years for a wild striped bass . <p> Tasting the wild and farmed striped bass side by side reveals their greatest difference . The farmed one has more fragile flesh but , many chefs agree , is inferior in flavor . " It 's muddy and bland , " said Eric Ripert , the chef at Le Bernardin , on West 51st Street . He will not serve it in his restaurant . Nor will Mr. Boulud at Daniel or Mr. Moonen at Oceana . <p> " It tastes more of the protein it eats all day than it does of itself , " Mr. Boulud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fed to the fish . <p> The wild striped bass , on the other hand , is a muscular fish . " It 's very special , because it 's not a fish that sits around so much , " Mr. Boulud said . It is not , he said , like the fragile Dover sole that " you can flake with your fork . " The flesh of the wild striped bass is firm but velvety and flakes in large slabs . <p> It can , of course , be filleted and steamed , cut into steaks and broiled . But why do that to a trophy fish ? <p> " The ultimate way of serving it , " Mr. Boulud said , " is whole . " Poaching , braising , roasting or grilling the fish whole , he said , retains the natural moisture and as much flavor as possible . Mr. Fessaguet , who has cooked the bass in every possible way , concurred , saying that he preferred poaching to draw out the essence . <p> Many home cooks , though , cower at dealing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It seems labor-intensive , " said Stephanie Lawrence , a homemaker from the Upper West Side , as she bought fillets of salmon at Citarella . But poaching a whole fish happens to be remarkably easy . With such a big fish , it is nice to just plunk it into a pan and turn on the heat . It can be simmered in a fish poacher or laid diagonally in a roasting pan . ( Poachers range from 16 to 36 inches long , with 24 inches as the minimum size for poaching a wild striped bass . ) <p> A whole fish , which usually needs to be ordered a few days in advance from a fish market , should be poached in a court-bouillon , a mixture of water , wine , aromatic vegetables and herbs . You can go Asian with lemon grass and ginger , stick to the traditional French mixture of carrots , onion , celery and a bouquet garni , or just keep it simple with a single herb and lemon slices . <p> Start the fish in cool liquid and simmer it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The timing is calculated by measuring the fish ( lying on its side ) at its thickest point , and poaching 7 minutes per inch . Then shut off the heat and let the fish steep in the court-bouillon a few minutes ; Mr. Boulud said this helps it retain its moisture . <p> A poached wild striped bass can be served warm or at room temperature , slathered with fruity olive oil , lemon juice and a sprinkling of coarse salt . But a vinaigrette , a vegetable sauce or even a spicy mayonnaise ( loosened with some of the court-bouillon ) is delicious , too , as long as it does not compete with the subtle flavors of the fish . <p> A whole poached wild striped bass should be taken to the table as you would a Thanksgiving turkey or a crown roast of pork , with a twinkle of extravagance and festivity . Fillet it at the table , with everyone passing plates and , as any connoisseur will tell you , do n't forget to eat the cheeks .
