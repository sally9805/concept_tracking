Prospects look bleak for America 's hunters . Only about 12 percent of Americans still hunt , and the percentage seems to be dwindling year by year . In 1982 , Americans spent 109,000 hours hunting on U.S. public lands ; by 1990 , the figure had dropped to less than half that . Part of this change probably reflects the shrinking population of small-town America , where hunting has always been a part of the rural way of life . But public attitudes are changing , too . Although most of us still think it all right to hunt for meat , many people oppose hunting for trophies or recreation . One poll shows that almost a third of all Americans feel sport hunting should be illegal . And that feeling is being promoted by organized antihunters , who are hard at work circulating petitions and propaganda , pressing for new laws and regulations to limit hunting , and even running through the woods in front of hunters to scare off their prey . Each side in this confrontation sees the other as a congregation of lunatics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prove their manhood by drilling anything that moves . For their pan , hunters view their opponents as sentimental fluffheads , who dream of the natural world as a happy Eden and idealize wild animals as little innocent people in bunny suits . Many hunters blame this antihunting sentiment on Walt Disney . A lot of hunting writers seem to think it all began with the 1942 release of Bambi and that if this film and certain other Disney products could somehow be suppressed , opposition to hunting would evaporate . Warren Page , a former editor of Field and Stream , expressed this view in a 1973 speech : In this country we have undergone an entire generation of brainwashing . Not only our kids but our wives , our brothers , our mothers , our cousins , our brothers-in-law have for twenty-five years been subjected to constant film and TV presentations of the Disney myth . In the Wonderful World of Disney ... the lion and the lamb love one another and only man is the bastard in the black hat ... whose chief aim is the spilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Syndrome . The Disney films may not have started out that way , but once it became clear that sentimentality and outright anthropomorphism would make money , that 's the way the films went .... They deliberately misinform viewers of basic biological facts . Bambi bashing pervades the defensive protests of today 's embattled outdoorsmen . " Too many antihunters believe in the Bambi quality of animals , " writes sports columnist Jim Wilson . " Those animals do n't procreate or eliminate wastes or eat one another , they gaily romp and play their lives away .... These people never knew or do n't want to know that death is as quotidian in the wild as sucking air in and blowing it out . " The hunters are surely right about one thing : for all its saccharine sweetness and childish whimsy , Disney 's Bambi is probably the most effective piece of antihunting propaganda ever made . It had a wide and deep influence on modern attitudes toward hunting , wildlife , and the wilderness . The Bambi myth was the creation of an ambitious young Hungarian writer named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in search of fame and fortune . Changing his Jewish-sounding name to Felix Salten , he began turning out volume after volume of plays , stories , and criticism and quickly became a major force in Viennese literary circles . Salten 's life , like those of many middle-class Viennese , seethed with public and private contradictions . A pillar of Establishment propriety on the surface , he was also the secret author of a notorious pornographic novel , The Memoirs of Josephine Mutzenbacher . An aristocratically contemptuous critic of American society and culture , he was also a Rotarian and the German translator of the long-running Broadway hit Abie 's Irish Rose . He liked to go hunting with Hapsburg aristocrats and even owned a private hunting preserve of his own just outside of Vienna . But he was also an ardent animal lover , and his hunting experiences led him to produce a masterpiece of antihunting sentiment . Salten 's novel Bambi : A Forest Life appeared in 1924 . Written in the decaying capital of the defeated and dismembered Hapsburg empire , in an intellectual atmosphere dominated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political extremists , the book radiates a cold aura of pessimism . " Death is the central theme of Bambi , " writes **25;89;TOOLONG George Reiger . " Something fears dying , or does die in terrible agony , in almost every chapter . " The forest world that Salten describes in sometimes exquisitely poetic prose provides a backdrop of intense color and beauty in front of which his animal characters suffer and bleed and limp and die awful , uncomprehending deaths . Some of those deaths result from disease or predation , but these natural evils seem trivial compared with the terrors inflicted on the animals by the satanic two-legged demigod they call Him with a capital H. The young roebuck Bambi finds himself dodging bullets within seconds after his first glimpse of a human , and he staggers through the book watching one after another of his friends and relatives fall to hunters ' guns . Although Salten 's tame animals revere humans as gods and the wild animals abominate them as demons , they all acknowledge human dominion over nature . " No one can escape Him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book . " He kills what He wants .... He can do anything . " " I worship Him , I serve Him , " yelps a dog to a maimed fox . " He 's all-powerful . He 's above all of you .... Everything that lives or grows comes from Him . " At the end of the book , this delusion is dispelled for Bambi when his dying father takes him to view the corpse of a murdered poacher . Bambi thereby learns the great secret : Homo sapiens is only another dying animal , and the governance of the world lies elsewhere . The English translation of Bambi appeared in 1928 . The translator was the young Whittaker Chambers , who had joined the Communist party not long before and was later to become famous as Richard Nixon 's star witness in the Alger Hiss case . The English novelist and Nobelist John Galsworthy , a virulent opponent of hunting , contributed a foreword to the translation , calling Salten 's book " a little masterpiece . " Reviewers were ecstatic . " The author , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has given us the life story of a forest deer , and Felix Salten 's comprehension of the entire universe as well .... Throw away your Spinozan tomes on pantheism and read Bambi . " Salten 's books would probably be as little read nowadays as Spinoza 's were it not for another event in 1928 . That September in a New York recording studio , a young film maker named Walt Disney managed to get a sound recording of " Turkey in the Straw " synchronized with the movements of a cartoon mouse . As a result of this cinematic breakthrough , Bambi 's name was going to become virtually synonymous with " deer , " although neither Disney nor Salten expected it yet . Walt Disney was born in Chicago in 1901 . When he was five years old , his family left the city and moved to a farm in Missouri . Disney always remembered the four years he spent on that farm as the happiest part of his childhood , and the idyllic farmyard and the animal friends he made there turn up again and again in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memories of the place involved hunting . When Disney 's family arrived , they found the farm overrun with rabbits , and Walt crept into the fields with his older brother Roy to watch them in their springtime mating rituals . Charmed and excited by all the March-hare antics , Walt spent the next few days memorializing them in his very first cartoons : childish sketches of cottontails playing peekaboo in the grass . But when Roy next returned to the fields , he brought along his air rifle and shot the biggest buck bunny he saw . Walt dissolved in tears when Roy broke the thrashing rabbit 's neck , and he refused to touch the rabbit stew their mother served up that evening . The contrast that this incident embodied between innocent animal desire and malign human contrivance was to recur in several Disney films . He would impress that love-and-death opposition on the world with particular force in Bambi . Disney began his film career making animated ads in Kansas City . Moving to Hollywood in 1923 , he pressed toward heights that no one before him had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing and barnyard humor of the first Mickey Mouse cartoons in 1928 , Disney and his artists took less than a decade to learn how to inspire pity and terror , as well as laughter , with a twelve-per-second flow of talking-animal caricatures . Everybody , including the intellectuals , went wild over the results . " A great many people , " gushed film critic Gilbert Seldes in 1937 , " consider Disney as the great satirist of the machine age . " Bambi posed serious challenges even for the Disney studio . The Disney cartoon animals of the 1930s had rounded outlines and a rubbery consistency , which made them easier to draw and gave their movements the conviction of exaggeration . They were drawn as bipeds with human hands , so that the animators could use gestures to express the characters ' emotions . When Disney selected Bambi for his second animated feature , he knew that these habits had to be abandoned . What Salten was saying about life , death , suffering , and God could not be put in the mouth of a cartoon deer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the animated deer the potential for tragedy , an unprecedentedly realistic set of drawing conventions had to be developed . The Bambi animators were told that they could use whatever human expressions they could impose upon the stiff , elongated face of a deer , but human-looking postures and movements were forbidden . The animators gritted their teeth and began imagining themselves into the bodies of deer , learning to express human feelings with shifts in weight support and gait patterns , with head and neck posture , with flicks of the ears and tail . Work on the script began in 1937 . The first story treatments were frivolous pastiches of cornball dialogue and Silly Symphony sight gags . But during 1938 and 1939 , as the clouds of war gathered in Europe and the Pacific , the script drafts grew increasingly tense and despairing and began to center on human cruelty and violence . On September 1 , 1939 , the day that German tanks struck across the Polish border and plunged Europe into World War II , the film 's story editor Perce Pearce announced that all predators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ script . " There 's nobody swooping down and eating someone else and their one common enemy is Man . That 's the conflict there  --  and keep it simple . " The first reasonably complete script treatment for Bambi that survives was written near the end of 1939 . It is saturated with bitter detestation of human beings and their weaponry . The fawns Bambi and Faline are shot at ( but missed ) as they play in a sunny meadow . The deer gather for a colloquium on human depravity . " Whenever man comes into the forest , there 's nothing but fear ! " cry the animals . " He kills without mercy ! " Bambi 's mother declares her faith in the possibility of human love . A little later , she and Bambi are stalked by a hunter . They flee , but a shot rings out ; we see her jerk in midleap and fall dead . As Bambi wanders the forest crying for his lost mother , he hears what he thinks is her voice and runs toward it joyously  --  to discover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bleeding and gasping with pain , Bambi staggers back to the thicket where he was born . He begins calling for his mother again and falls down , apparently dead . His anxious father arrives to watch over him until the unconscious fawn begins to breathe once more . Humans reenter the forest after Bambi has grown into an antlered buck . Hunting dogs run in the vanguard , praising human omnipotence and tearing cornered animals to bits . Friend Hare , the prototype of Thumper , intercepts a bullet and dies at Bambi 's feet , murmuring , " I do n't understand  --  What have I ever done to Them ? " After a fire set by the intruders devastates the forest , Bambi 's father leads him through the smoldering ashes to a man 's charred cadaver , revealing the great secret of Homo sapiens ' animal nature . The film ends in a scene of rebirth , with the forest sprouting anew and Bambi glimpsing Faline with two newborn fawns . In succeeding drafts , the script grew simpler and sweeter , and the animals ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until no dialogue remained to establish their superstitious awe of humanity . The climactic scene with the cooked cadaver was reluctantly dropped from the film in the last stages of production , and with it went the last vestiges of Salten 's attempted reconciliation of human beings with nature . The only remaining discussion of the human presence is Bambi 's question , " What happened , Mother ? Why did we all run ? " and Mother 's slow , portentous response : " Man ... was in the forest . " The prickly uncertainties of Salten 's novel are replaced in the film by the crystalline simplicities of myth . Deer biology is distorted to fit the familiar symbolic cycle of the agricultural year ; like John Barleycorn , Bambi is born and sows his seed in the spring and is cut down in the autumn . Christian symbolism pervades the film 's opening scenes . After the adoring animals finish hailing the birth of the young prince and depart , the camera pulls back to show mother and child nestled in a thorny thicket  --  a tableau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture "  --  while a remote , godlike father looks down from a heavenly crag . Contemporary psychoanalytic gimmicks also made their way into Bambi . The first English translation of Jung 's Archetypes of the Collective Unconscious appeared in 1939 . Late in that year , the Disney conception of Faline abruptly changed from a shy fawn to a teasing , seductive minx who repeatedly shows up as a double of Bambi 's reflection in the water . All this bears a suspiciously minute resemblance to Jung 's description of his " anima " archetype . Freudian motifs are also prominent in the film . As one might expect of an intellectual in Freud 's Vienna , Salten had put plenty of Oedipal conflict into his book , and the Disney people picked up on it . Bambi 's film father is strong , scary , and forbiddingly distant , and the tension between them is resolved only by the wrenching death of Bambi 's mother . The film portrays the natural world as a realm of peace and beauty , saturated with innocent love in all its varieties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the animals ' permanently dilated pupils , like those of a Renaissance courtesan on belladonna . The sole source of discord in the magic forest is the human presence , which manifests itself as a wave of mad slaughter and ecological catastrophe . The Freudian opposition between the instincts of life and death is equated throughout the film with the symbolic opposition of humanity to nature , and no possible resolution of the conflict is hinted at . Conflict between humanity and nature is mirrored even in the film 's musical score . Like Fantasia , Bambi is essentially a silent movie : a wordless , rhythmical ballet performed to an orchestral accompaniment . ( The final script contains less than a thousand spoken words . ) The alienation of the human species from the natural order is symbolized by barring the human presence completely from the universal dance . Human beings are represented only by ominous , lurching music that  --  unlike the rest of the score  --  is unaccompanied by onscreen choreography . All these psychological and symbolic devices chugging away in Disney 's Bambi  --  its archetypal characters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pagan mythology , its perfectly choreographed universal dances of all things not human , its A-B-A architecture silently proclaiming the eternal recurrence of nature , its superbly executed animation , its occasionally breathtaking visual beauty , and its despairing subliminal consciousness of the implacable onrush of World War II  --  give the movie the force of a sledgehammer for many viewers , despite its pervasive and repellent cuteness . " I came out of Bambi on my hands and knees , " recalled director Richard Williams in a 1989 interview . Reviewing Bambi when it was rereleased in 1988 , critic Roger Ebert described it as " a parable of sexism , nihilism , and despair , portraying absentee fathers and passive mothers in a world of death and violence , " and called it unsuitable for young and impressionable children . The first attack on Bambi by America 's outdoorsmen came in 1942 from Raymond J. Brown , the editor of Outdoor Life . Denouncing the movie as " the worst insult ever offered in any form to American sportsmen , " Brown complained that Bambi showed hunters engaging in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with dogs . Now hunters ' attacks on Bambi are , if anything , more strident and insistent , but they no longer criticize it as a slur on the honor of sportsmen . The line commonly encountered nowadays is that the movie is nature-fakery , a fantastic distortion of the facts about the behavior of wild beasts , and that children who see it are misled into a foolish sentimentalism about wildlife . American hunters , who tend to cluster toward the political right , have also picked up the scent of Marxism and atheism in Bambi . In a 1980 article in Field and Stream , George Reiger argues that Salten wrote Bambi out of a pious liberal revulsion against the carnage of World War I , and Chambers was attracted to it because of his Marxist inability " to accept the impersonal realities of nature . " But in Reiger 's eyes , what Disney himself " and his staff of little helpers " are guilty of is not Marxism but blasphemy  --  specifically mockery of Christ . Reiger complains that " in Disney 's version , once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whitetail Superstar , man 's hunting of deer becomes a crime comparable to the persecution of Christ . " Is there any truth in what these writers say about the Bambi syndrome and its importance ? Certainly none of the things that hunters object to in the film originated with Disney . The vision of the wilderness as an Eden and of man as a destructive intruder into the harmony of nature extends back into classical and medieval thinking . Wounded deer have for centuries personified injured innocence . They are common symbols of the crucified Christ in medieval literature ; one fourteenth-century German poet described Jesus as a hunted stag " whose hoof is stained with blood , for He ransomed us at so great a price . " Moral indignation over hunting flared up now and then even in antiquity and has become steadily more commonplace in Western culture since the Renaissance . The notion that all this is Walt Disney 's fault is wishful thinking on the part of Reiger , Page , and other outdoorsmen . Yet if Disney did not invent the symbolism that portrays hunted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gave it a mass audience , an irresistible graphic expression , and a mythical embodiment that it would not otherwise have had . Bambi has become emblematic of deer in general . Stand for an hour or two in front of a deer pen at a zoo ; some child or its mother is sure to point to a deer and exclaim , " Look ! Bambi ! " ( I have heard the name applied to sika , axis , white-tailed and mule deer , as well as to various more or less gracile antelopes , up to and including the big , cowlike nilgai of India . ) Even some jocular hunters like to call their quarry " Bambis . " Bambi seems to be on his way to becoming a lower-case noun , as his predecessor Reynard the Fox did in the French language . As the stereotypic deer , Bambi symbolizes all those things we associate with deer , including doe-eyed innocence , wilderness , and the natural order . ( When James Watt became U.S. Secretary of the Interior , editorial cartoons showed the forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and comedian Mark Russell announced that Bambi was leaving for Canada . ) Some historians of forestry think that the forest-fire sequence in Bambi was what drove the U.S. Forest Service to launch a no-burn policy two years later . Bambi also had an important influence as the prototype for Disney 's True-Life Adventures of the 1950s . Two central conventions of those pioneering wildlife films derive from Bambi . One is the eternal recurrence , in which a final return to the starting place marks one round of nature 's ancient and unchanging cycle . The other is the exclusion of the human image from the picture  --  and , by implication , from the kingdom of nature . Even hunters fall prey to the Bambi syndrome . One ex-hunter interviewed by the writer John Mitchell for his book The Hunt admitted that his attitude was changed by his two daughters , who " got the idea every deer is named Bambi . And I began to wonder what is sport and what is n't . " In the last paragraphs of his book , Mitchell tells of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his rifle 's sights . Suddenly , he stops , ejects his cartridge , and collapses , trembling uncontrollably after staring into " the eyes  --  the huge glistening eyes that had torn my own away from the cross hairs on the shoulder . " In a 1982 Smithsonian article , Mitchell frankly blamed his shakes on Bambi : " Walt Disney got to me early .... I wept for Bambi when the huntsmen slew its mamma ; yet today I count deer slayers among my closest friends , and ... occasionally join them afield , bearing arms . But I have never shot a deer , or at one . " Bambi and other Disney films had a profound impact on American attitudes toward hunting , wildlife , and nature . Today , fifty-one years since the first release of Bambi , they continue to have a similar impact on children and adults alike , and their influence is sure to be strengthened by the videotape revolution that has put copies of these movies into millions of American homes . These Disney products have been influential not only because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are predisposed to think for other reasons . Much of their force derives from our vision of the natural world as a special , mystical realm from which human beings are alienated by their culture and technology . That vision was not dreamed up in the Disney studios . It has deep roots in the Romantic rebellion against scientific materialism , and its branches extend into just about every aspect of twentieth-century thought , from psychoanalysis to postmodernism . Ironically , that same vision is also central to hunting as we define and understand it . The line we draw between the human world and nature is what separates wild from domestic animals and thereby distinguishes the hunter 's craft from the butcher 's . When hunters say , as many do , that they go hunting to restore their sense of oneness with nature , they are at bottom expressing the same sort of sentimental reverence for " nature " that underlies the Bambi syndrome .
