Section : MY BRUSH WITH HISTORY <p> What I 'm about to record is true , including the parts I 've forgotten . Seeing the movie Quiz Show disinterred a memory almost half a century old . On the way back there , though , I must pause first at 1958 , when Charles Van Doren was holding forth on the tube and piling up all that money on the " Twenty-One " show . Being something of a snob at the time , I had n't acquired the habit of watching television . Besides , I was a book editor , and my evenings were spent reading manuscripts . <p> But I did watch Charlie . His sister Ann lived two doors down Bleecker Street from me , and he and I were nodding acquaintances . Also , I myself had won some money as a contestant on a quiz show back in the dark ages of radio . So week after week I watched  --  with empathy , with a degree of jealousy ( radio quiz winners won hundreds , not hundreds of thousands ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the contestants searched their souls in the isolation booths began to seem awfully studied . Their depiction in Quiz Show was certainly among the movie 's best effects and vividly recalled for me my own brief moment of stand-up glory and my early basic training in how broadcasters control who wins quiz shows and why . <p> In the 1940s , radio shows were produced by advertising agencies . Four days after my discharge from the Army late in December 1945 my godfather , Pete Barnum , a Madison Avenue advertising executive , arranged to get me on a quiz show , of which there seemed to be dozens on the air . This one was so sparsely produced , and its emcee so uncelebrated and free of charisma , that I have forgotten its name , and his . <p> As instructed , I turned up an hour and a quarter before the broadcast at the production office in the Times Square district . Two men in suits were huddled with two young soldiers in the back of the big room , and another functionary was talking with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a far corner . These , I gathered , were the other contestants . <p> A shirtsleeved man , maybe forty years old , who turned out to be the announcer/emcee , approached and greeted me by name . " You must be Max , " he said . " Close , " I said . <p> The contestants would be assigned different categories of questions , he told me . Mine was to be the dates on which notable events of the year just past had occurred . He would name an event , and I was to guess , within thirty days , when it had taken place . It would n't be fitting for him to lay it all out for me , he said stuffily , but for starters it might be a good idea if I brushed up on V-E Day , and on just when Charlie Chaplin 's paternity suit was brought or settled or hit the headlines . <p> I told him I had been overseas for the entire year and was rusty on domestic news events . But I was already planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sixth Avenue , and I recall my flush of annoyance when he made the suggestion I visit such a store to catch up on the year 's happenings . Thinking back , I suppose each of us carried some shoulder chips as baggage into our colloquy . He probably resented my being sponsored , as it were , by an advertising honcho , and I resented his obvious relish at being able to dispense or withhold information of value to me . <p> As the announcer and I talked , I could not help noticing that the two soldiers seemed to be getting walked through their routine more exhaustively than I , an observation I was not shy about mentioning to the announcer . <p> " I may as well tell you , " he said , " one of the soldiers is going to be the winner . " <p> I do n't know why he told me , and I do n't expect he was supposed to . Perhaps it was because he thought I , a known nepot , ought to be sophisticated enough to understand the logic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my nose in this foregone conclusion . <p> " How come ? " I asked him . <p> " They 're in uniform . It 's as simple as that . The audience will be rooting for them . " <p> I , feeling the natural contempt of a twenty-three-year-old overseas veteran toward teenage stateside recruits , pointed out that their tunics were unadorned by any mark of rank or length or theater of service , and they in fact gave every evidence of having been in the Army approximately long enough to get their teeth fixed at Fort Dix , whereas the uniform I had taken off four days earlier had borne sergeant 's stripes , a YANK patch on the shoulder signifying my status as a combat correspondent on the Army weekly , plus ribbons signifying Pacific Theater , Air Medal , and , yes , the Good Conduct Medal over the left breast pocket . <p> " If I 'd worn it , would I have had a shot at being the winner ? " <p> " We could n't have three soldiers , " he replied , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a veteran , how come you 're not wearing the ruptured duck ? " This was the universal nickname for the gold-colored lapel pin issued to all discharged servicemen . <p> I shrugged . " I 'm just not . " I was n't about to articulate to this patronizing oaf my feeling that the ruptured duck was uncool  --  or corny , as I probably thought of it then . <p> " By the way , " he said , " how do you want to be billed ? How do we introduce you ? " <p> I told him I was goofing off while awaiting word of acceptance to Harvard graduate school . It was true enough , but it sounded a bit stuffy and elitist to us both . He suggested " college student . " <p> If the audience was into soldiers , I wanted whatever piece of that action I could get . " How about ' recently discharged veteran ' ? " <p> So we decided he 'd combine the two designations . <p> I was making a move toward the door when one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself and walked over to say something to the announcer , who immediately raised his hand to summon me back . The other man called me by name , my right name , and introduced himself as the show 's producer . He made affectionate mention of Pete Barnum and indicated the announcer had accidentally neglected to , remind me of one matter that could come up on the program on which they wanted to brief me : They wanted me to remember the date of April 12 . " It 's the date of FDR 's death , " he said , " and it 's a date we think every American should know . The audience will want you to hit it right on the head  --  no thirty-day leeway . Listen , you do well , there 's no reason you could n't win second-prize money , O.K. ? See you back here no later than quarter to eight . " <p> I was not too proud to thank him , and as I left for the back-issue store , I thought over what I 'd been told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stempel on " Twenty-One " was , of course , at work even in 1945 . The producers would have been crazy not to have tilted the decision to one of the GIs . The uniforms would n't be visible to people listening on their radios , but radio shows drew their energy from the enthusiasm and applause of the studio audience , and back then soldier was a synonym for winner . A guy in a suit meant nothing . <p> Notwithstanding , I schemed for a way to upstage the two rookies as I speed-read my way through a stack of old Newsweeks . <p> When I returned to the office where I 'd been briefed , I passed the main entrance to the theater . Then , as now , it did n't take much to attract a crowd in New York . It was a cold night , . but there was a big gang out front , waiting for the doors to open so they could file in and watch our little gavotte . <p> Inside there was a podium . There were bright lights and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mike , and the audience was obediently enthusiastic as questions were asked and answered . I looked over at the deadpan faces of four or five men behind the glass of the control booth , and one of them gave me a perfunctory high-sign wave . It was the producer . <p> I have no recollection of how the girl did or of just how things were arranged so that one of the soldiers did indeed wind up with the most points . I answered all my questions correctly enough , and I did win second-prize money . The other questions are long forgotten , but I got Chaplin right . The memory I still carry with me is of my final exchange with my interlocutor . <p> " What day did President Franklin D. Roosevelt die ? " <p> I paused , eyes cast upward , as if the answer lay in the files above the stage . The studio audience 's anxiety for me to get it right was palpable . Finally I spoke , and I was emphatic . " April thirteenth . " <p> There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty-day limit , of course , but I 'd been given the exact date , the date all Americans were expected to know and I 'd muffed it . <p> The announcer shot me a scathing look . I 'd double-crossed him . " The thirteenth ? " He made the word sound like sacrilege . <p> " No ? Not the thirteenth ? I could have sworn  --  oh-h-h . " I said , and I raised my hand dramatically . " I know . Out where I was , in the Pacific , I was on the other side of the International Date Line . Back here in the States I do n't believe I added " for you civilians , " but it was surely there in my tone it was the twelfth , of course . But at the 73rd Very Heavy Bombardment Wing on Saipan it was definitely the thirteenth . " <p> Immodesty compels me to admit the crowd went wild . I looked over and saw that even the producer and his cohorts in the control booth were laughing and clapping . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand over it . " Pretty cute , Harvard , " he whispered .
