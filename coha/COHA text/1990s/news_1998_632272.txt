<p> President Clinton 's proposal to extend Medicare to early retirees ages 62-64 and laid-off workers over age 55 merits cautious consideration . <p> In principle , there is no reason Medicare ought to be limited to those 65 or older . As a matter of fact , Medicare already is available to Americans of all ages who suffer from kidney failure . At the same time , with Medicare teetering on the brink of bankruptcy , any benefit expansion that exacerbates the fiscal problems afflicting Medicare is ill-advised . <p> The Clinton administration claims the president 's proposal is self-financing . Those who are 62-64 would pay a monthly Medicare premium of $ 300 and a monthly Medicare premium surcharge of $ 10-$ 50 once they reach 65 and qualify for the regular Medicare program . Laid-off workers over 55 would pay $ 400 per month . <p> The Clinton administration represents its proposal as simply allowing those who could afford to do so to buy into Medicare before age 65 . The key question is whether it really is self-financing . Would the premiums charged those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Those over 55 who are healthy often can purchase insurance from the private sector for no more than it would cost them to buy into Medicare under the Clinton proposal . For those with health problems  --  those with the greatest need for health insurance  --  finding affordable insurance is a different matter . <p> The risk inherent in the Clinton proposal is that those most likely to buy into Medicare would be those with serious health problems unable to find affordable private insurance , which could result in benefit costs far exceeding the revenues from the premiums paid by those buying in . If that were the case , implementing the Clinton proposal would have the ironic impact of hastening the fiscal demise of Medicare . <p> The Clinton proposal does have the salutary effect of reminding us that there are several million Americans who do not have access to affordable health insurance . The need for health reform is urgent . But whatever is done must be practical , rather than yet another fiscally irresponsible program that accomplishes little more than exacerbating the fiscal woes afflicting Medicare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Augustana College , <p> Rock Island <p> By e-mail <p> A drop in the bucket <p> Despite Gov . Edgar 's veto of the education tax credit bill , I would like to think we are drawing closer to an era when tax dollars collected from all citizens will be available to support the education of all students , not just the students who attend state schools . <p> The state long has supported educational diversity at the college level with the Illinois State Scholarship program , which assists students attending the college of their choice , state or private . Federal programs offer similar assistance on the college level and for preschools of choice as well . Minnesota and Iowa have educational tax credit programs for K-12 students , programs that have been upheld in court . <p> Perhaps Illinois ' elementary and high school students soon will have the same freedom that others enjoy . The Legislature can hasten that time by voting to override the governor 's veto . <p> As for the money involved ( a maximum of $ 500 per family ) , the 300,000 Illinois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more than $ 6,000 in tax support if they were in the public schools . That amounts to nearly $ 2 billion additional taxpayer expense were these students to attend public schools . <p> If Illinois citizens would gladly pay that extra cost to support students enrolled in public schools , I can not see them denying a much lesser cost to support students in nonpublic schools . <p> Thomas Hetland , <p> president , <p> Driscoll Catholic High School , <p> Addison <p> Live free or else <p> By his veto of the private school tuition bill , Gov . Edgar has saved the state taxpayers more than $ 150 million and helped preserve religious freedom . <p> For more than a decade , the religious right has promoted one scheme after another to wreck the public school system and our religious freedoms . We must be ever vigilant that such schemes not succeed . <p> Raymond Mostek , <p> Illinois State Director , <p> Americans for <p> Religious Liberty , <p> Silver Spring , Md . <p> Watch your wallet <p> Parents of public school students as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veto of the tuition tax credit bill . <p> Opponents failed to mention that public school parents also were eligible to receive a tax credit . The bill specifically defined schools as " any public or nonpublic elementary school or secondary school in Illinois that is in compliance with Title VI . . . " Furthermore , " qualified education expenses " include book fees and lab fees . <p> We are the government . It 's our money . This bill was about letting taxpayers keep more of their money for the education of their children  --  in public or private school . <p> Taxpayers everywhere need to take note : Your contributions to the educational system are not appreciated . They are expected , demanded and confiscated as the system 's own . <p> Mary Ann Dolce , Wheaton <p> Forecast : dim <p> Regarding " Polls find it may truly be a happy new year : Most see good times coming " ( news story , Jan. 1 ) : While 60 percent polled believed their communities will have more job opportunities , the polls once again have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job opportunities and the decline of employers ' offering affordable health insurance . <p> As a parent of a young adult just out of high school who is looking for employment as well as health insurance coverage , there is less optimism in my family . My son held a fast-food job , worked full-time hours and could n't get health insurance through his employer . Try to pay for auto insurance , private health insurance and everything else on minimum wage . <p> The adage " an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure " does n't mean anything if you ca n't afford that ounce . <p> Carol Beyer , Algonquin <p> The vaccine debate <p> Regarding " Parents debate hepatitis B shots for kids " ( news story , Jan. 11 ) , here 's another opinion on vaccines : <p> Hepatitis B differs from the other illnesses against which children are vaccinated in that it is an adult illness associated with specific high-risk behavior . Infants are at risk of contracting this illness at birth only if their mothers are infected with the virus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diseases Seminar in Washington , D.C. , regarding the safety of the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations and the duration infants would be protected from hepatitis B  --  many felt immunity would not persist into adolescence , making infant immunization a wasted effort . <p> The pediatrics academy is not recommending adolescent immunization , except for those known to engage in high-risk behavior . <p> Dr. Mayer Eisenstein 's statement ( news story , Jan. 12 ) that " there is no transmission of Hepatitis B child to child " holds ground especially among healthy mothers who are not in the high-risk group and therefore can not infect their newborn . <p> Grace Girdwain , Burbank <p> Function over form <p> Lee Bey is right ( column , Dec. 27 ) . River North 's frog atop Rainforest Cafe is grotesque . On the other hand , if chic furniture stores display eclectic dining arrangements  --  Queen Anne chairs ( circa 1700 ) around a 1998 glass table  --  why is an attractive , 1920s-vintage steakhouse facade on the 1950s bare concrete base of Marina Towers odious ? Maybe it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enough money so Marina City owners can repair the crumbling garage floors ! <p> William J. O'Donohue , Hinsdale <p> Really honked off <p> Mayor Daley has vastly improved the quality of life in Chicago by targeting everyday nuisance crimes . But there is one unaddressed problem affecting workers and residents : incessant and unnecessary beeping by drivers . <p> In my 11th floor office at Wacker and Monroe , I am continually disturbed by beeping from the street . With suburbanites getting this noisy , disruptive image of city life as they try to work in their offices , Chicago always will be chasing after residents . <p> Daley needs to direct police to aggressively ticket these offenders who are destroying the quality of life in Chicago . <p> Kathryn M. Kinnerk , <p> Near West Side <p> I got ta be me <p> Regarding the letter writer ( Jan. 6 ) who took exception to Hollywood 's comic caricature of Mr. Magoo , and the stereotyping of Italians in gangster roles : Grow up ! <p> If someone does n't like me , my ethnic origin or my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ egotistical enough to consider it their hard luck that they wo n't have the chance to enjoy my company or what I have to offer , and my good fortune that I 'm not obliged to associate with them . <p> G.P.
