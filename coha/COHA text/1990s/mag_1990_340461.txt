Who could resist the temptation ? The ever solicitous Citibank dangled before me in the autumn mail an offer of a preapproved Visa card that would grant one frequent-flyer mile on American Airlines for each dollar charged . The lure of these two American obsessions  --  credit and free travel  --  proved irresistible , so I mailed the form and soon received cards for my wife and me . A month later , after we had rung up more than $4,200 in charges ( about 20% of what would be needed for a free round-trip domestic ticket ) , my wife pulled out the card to purchase a blouse . " Sorry , " said the clerk after running the card through the computer three times . " Your card is no good . I have to take it . " <P> A call to Citibank produced a perplexing explanation : " Sorry , you have a derogatory credit statement , " intoned the clerk . Pursuing it further , I was connected to a Mr. Thomas , who put matters even more bluntly : " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he declared . A repossessed car , about $70,000 in tax liens , a bankruptcy adjustment plan and scads of debts unpaid . " That ca n't be me , " I protested , explaining that I was a paragon of fiscal responsibility . He was unpersuaded . <P> Suddenly , the credit-travel enticement had turned into a Kafkaesque nightmare of mistaken identities , computer screw-ups and human errors , all spilling out of the vast and powerful credit-reporting system that tries to keep tabs on $720 billion in total U.S. consumer debt . But this was not just one person 's bad dream . While the credit industry claims that errors are discovered in fewer than 0.5% of individual credit records , some analysts believe glitches are more common . According to a study by James Williams of Consolidated Information Services , a New Jersey credit bureau , 40% of the 150 million people with credit histories on file with the three largest repositories  --  TRW in Orange , Calif. , Trans Union in Chicago and Equifax in Atlanta  --  have one or more errors in their files . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , others can wreak havoc . For the most part , people remain blissfully unaware of the problems until , like $ me , they are mysteriously stripped of a credit card or rejected for a loan . Says M.E. Buckner , president of Informative Research , a mortgage-credit- reporting company in Anaheim , Calif. : " There are mistakes in the system , and we have mechanisms to correct them , but you correct the system only when a consumer complains . " <P> In mid-argument with Mr. Thomas , a light clicked on in my head . Three years ago , the Internal Revenue Service had snooped around my neighborhood asking about a Michael G. Riley and his horrendous credit history . After many phone calls , the IRS admitted it had the wrong man . Perhaps my deadbeat namesake had returned to haunt my credit rating . Hearing this tale , Mr. Thomas softened a bit and told me to send him some identifying papers . Then he dropped another bombshell : Citibank , he said , had discovered a " death alert " filed on my Social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit a disaster , I was also officially dead .
