It must seem odd to the duck and deer populations that Americans have paid more than $255 million this summer for the experience of being prey . In Jurassic Park we had the supreme thrill of being hunted for food by creatures far larger , faster , and  --  counting teeth and claws  --  better armed than we are . With the raptors closing in , we saw how vulnerable the human body is  --  no claws , no exoskeleton , no blinding poison sprays . Take away our guns and high-voltage fences and we are , from a typical predator perspective , tasty mounds of unwrapped meat . <P> If the experience resonates to the most ancient layers of our brains , it 's probably because we spent our first million years or so not just hunting and gathering , but being hunted and gathered . T. Rex had been gone for 60 million years when our progenitors came along , but there were saber-toothed tigers , lions , cougars , leopards , bears , wolves and wild boars waiting at the edge of every human settlement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunter " has flatteringly obscured our true prehistory as prey . According to the myth , " man " climbed down from the trees one day , strode out into the savanna with a sharpened stick in his hand and started slaughtering the local ungulates . After that , supposedly , the only violence prehumans had to worry about was from other stick-wielding bipeds like themselves . Thus some punctured australopithecine skulls found in Africa were at first chalked up to " intentional armed assault "  --  until someone pointed out that the punctures precisely fit the tooth gap of the leopard . <P> Humans did n't even invent effective action-at-a-distance weapons until a mere 40,000 or so years ago . Only with these new tools , like the bow and arrow and the spear thrower , could our ancestors begin to mimic the speed and sharpness of a big cat 's claws . Even so , predator animals remained a major threat . As late as the 7th century B.C. , a stela erected by the Assyrian King Assurbanipal recounts the ferocity of the lions and tigers after torrential rains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King , of course , stamped out the beasts . <P> Our collective memory of the war against the predator beasts is preserved in myth and fairy tale . Typically , a mythical hero starts out by taking on the carnivorous monster that is ravaging the land : Perseus saves Andromeda from becoming a sea monster 's snack . Theseus conquers the Minotaur who likes to munch on Athenian youth . Beowulf destroys the loathsome night-feeding Grendel . Heracles takes on a whole zoo of horrors : lions , hydras , boars . In European fairy tales it 's the wolves you have to watch out for  --  if the cannibal witches do n't get you first .
