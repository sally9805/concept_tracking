<p> Paul Moorcraft looks at the struggle to maintain white supremacy in what is now Zimbabwe , a hundred years after Cecil Rhodes ' pioneers carved out a British colony there . <p> It is exactly one hundred years since Cecil Rhodes ' pioneer column trundled into Mashonaland to establish Fort Salisbury and the new colonial state named after its founder : Rhodesia . A decade ago white-ruled Rhodesia became the independent state of Zimbabwe . In the 1890s the first settlers brutally suppressed a series of native rebellions ' or Chimurenga ( the Shona word for resistance ' ) , as the indigenous peoples called their defence against alien invaders . Thereafter , white Rhodesians fought a number of wars on behalf of the British Empire and then indulged in a traumatic civil war that lasted fourteen years and took over 30,000 lives . The bitterness remains , not least among the many  --  often partisan  --  writers who are struggling to explain and explore the war 's many facets , some still shrouded in secrecy . <p> The very nature of the act of rebellion against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its critics , the illegal , declaration of independence in 1965  --  is still fiercely debated . For the white Rhodesians , it wag in retrospect , a colossal blunder . The self-governing British colony of Southern Rhodesia , to use its correct designation , was practically independent in all but name . That had been the case since 1923 or , arguably , 1911 . Provided the right kind of constitutional verbiage could have been conjured up , both Labour and Conservative administrations in London would have been happy to remove that colonial albatross from its neck . If Ian Smith , the Rhodesian prime minister , had been half as cynical as some of the British politicians he dealt with , he could have agreed to any legal wording , secured Rhodesian independence and then torn up the agreement . But his Rhodesian Front Party wanted more than a legalisation of the status quo ; it was committed to achieving full sovereignty so as to turn the clock back . <p> The white supremacists wanted to strip the African majority of the few rights it held in 1965 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the same measure of independence as the other states in the former Central African federation , Zambia ( Northern Rhodesia ) and Malawi ( Nyasaland ) . The whites in power in Salisbury argued that they had proved their experience and success in governing the country , especially compared with the untried black politicians who took over in the neighbouring states . Smith and his followers reckoned that London would not , in the final analysis , use force against the rebel colony , partly because of its brave war record on behalf of Britain : per head of ( white ) population Rhodesia had contributed more in both world wars than any other part of the empire , including the United Kingdom . More especially , a large proportion of the white Rhodesian population had served in the British armed forces in the Second World War , and close ties existed with the senior echelons of the British services . Many British ex-servicemen , especially from the Royal Air Force , had settled in the prosperous colony . <p> Whatever the moral and political arguments , Britain did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt now that after a few resignations here and there , the army , the Royal Navy and even the Royal Air Force ( supposedly the most disaffected service ) would have carried out any orders to subdue the first national treason against the Crown since the American War of Independence . On the Rhodesian side , UDI was a military bluff . According to a very senior Rhodesian intelligence officer , except for one or two senior members of the British South Africa Police the Rhodesian police force and a few South African hotheads in the depleted Rhodesian Light Infantry ' , white Rhodesians would not have resisted a rapid show of force . The bluff , though , was never called . That master tactician , the British Prime Minister Harold Wilson , threw away his best cards by renouncing force at the outset . He opted for sanctions instead . Threatening to throw the book ' at the Rhodesian Front , he simply flicked a few pages . . . one at a time . Sanctions were a gesture , never a concerted policy . Until 1974 they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed to end the war in weeks rather than months ' , as Wilson had premised , for a number of reasons . Above all , they were applied slowly , half-heartedly and cynically . Britain , for one , kept on supplying oil to the rebels . Washington made a point of trading in strategic materials , especially chrome . The Soviet bloc accounted for more than hag of Rhodesia 's illicit deals , as Ken Flower , the head of Rhodesia 's Central Intelligence Organisation ( CIO ) , made clear in his recent memoirs . Many of these transactions were arranged through plant companies in Austria , West Germany , Switzerland and Belgium . Heavy machinery came from the East , usually in ship meets brought by Yugoslavs who had no qualms about flying to Salisbury , as long as their passports were not stamped . As one Rhodesian Special Branch officer involved with these deals noted recently : Slavs were popular with Rhodesian immigration officers because they inevitably brought gifts of plum brandy and offered around cigarettes of heavily scented tobacco ' . <p> The most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to the greatest paradox of the Rhodesian war . Rhodesia broke away from Britain to avoid black rule and then , with the onset of the guerrilla war , became completely dependent upon a South African regime which was even more determined than Britain to establish a black leader in Salisbury . Above all , the South African government dreaded the possibility of a victorious Marxist army marching through the streets of Salisbury , a precedent which it feared might be repeated in Pretoria . Rhodesia transformed itself from a self-governing British colony into an occasionally truculent , but inevitably subservient , sector of Afrikaner imperium . Ian Smith became , in effect , the leader of another South African homeland . Pretoria selfishly manipulated its Rhodesian satrapy ( while making a huge profit on sanctions-breaking to the captive rebel market ) by providing just enough military support to allow Smith time to reach the elusive settlement ' with black ' moderates ' . This policy totally backfired and merely served to lengthen the savage war . <p> Until 1973 Britain tried hard to settle with Salisbury . In each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by what he termed his four constituencies ' : the Conservatives , the Commonwealth , the United Nations and South Africa . The inevitable compromises that ensued gave Wilson 's policies that madcap flair ' , in the words of the American ambassador to Zambia . The end result was an impasse : no force , no confrontation with South Africa and no sell-out ' . The inherent contradictions meant more leaky sanctions and growing white Rhodesian intransigence . Thus ensued the long diplomatic melodrama punctuated by angry encounters on ships , foolish estimates and silly superlatives . These negotiations gave Smith credibility at home and some respectability abroad . Meanwhile , Pretoria played a subtle game until 1978 , when the Prime Minister , P.W . Botha , risked nearly all to back the so-called internal settlement ' , with Bishop Muzorewa playing the role of useful idiot ' , to use a Marxist phrase . <p> In 1965 , few of the key players in the Rhodesian saga foresaw the main elements of the unfolding Greek tragedy . Not only was black rule inevitable , but it was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with UDI , Rhodesian whites were unlikely to accept that fate without a considerable struggle . That struggle was bound to be prolonged , if , firstly , the black nationalist movement was to become divided , and , secondly , international pressures , especially sanctions , were not comprehensively applied . Black nationalists spent as much time fighting each other as combating Smith 's troops , and Pretoria made a political point of circumventing sanctions to show that an even larger possible set of sanctions against apartheid would not work . In the 1970s comprehensive sanctions against South Africa as well as Rhodesia were not on the main political agenda . <p> And so the Rhodesian saga was to be decided largely on the battlefield . The war can be divided into three stages : from UDI to 1972 , the small Rhodesian security forces were engaged in a conflict they could have won decisively in military terms ; from 1972 to 1976 , it could be described as no-win ' war ; and from 1976 to 1980 the Rhodesians were sucked into a war they were manifestly losing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeat was around the corner for white Rhodesia . <p> The military reasons for white Rhodesia 's long survival were essentially threefold : nationalist divisions , the operational efficiency of the Rhodesian forces and massive South African support , particularly in the last phase of the fighting . The South Africans first intervened in 1967 , when they sent approximately 2,000 members of the South African Police ( SAP ) to help guard the northern border with Zambia . Policemen were sent for two reasons . Salisbury always insisted that it was counteracting a criminal conspiracy by external Communist-inspired agitators , not an internal civil war against racial injustice , and , secondly , Pretoria did not initially contribute army units as this could have been construed as a military intervention in a British colony . <p> Rhodesia 's senior commanders were hostile to this initial intercession , but they were firmly told by Smith that the South Africans were needed for political as much as military reasons . Often ill-trained , overconfident and bored , many of these policemen performed abysmally . Until a number of them were killed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , according to Rhodesian observers . Their reluctant allies used to call the SAP contingents clumpies ' because of their poor bushcraft . Eventually the Rhodesians were issued with explicit orders not to call their allies by disparaging names . ( Presumably an order ignored as much as the official instructions to the Rhodesian Special Air Service to desist from referring to their own Combined Operations HQ as the Muppet Show ' . ) <p> The South Africans rapidly learnt , however , for they were in Rhodesia to improve their own counter-insurgency skills as much as to pull their neighbour 's chestnuts out of the fire ' , as their Prime Minister , John Vorster , put it . Vorster used this force as a political lever . In 1975 he recalled the police ( but left his pilots and helicopters on loan ) , as a part of his detente exercise with black nationalist leaders such as Kenneth Kaunda . Then , in 1976 , during the American peace initiative led by Henry Kissinger , Vorster played a major role in bringing Smith to heel . Tying Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jelly to a wall ' . But the Afrikaner did just that when he cut off nearly all military shipments to Smith . Rhodesian troops in the field were sometimes reduced to a few days ' supplies of ammunition . In this sense , Vorster did as much as the guerrilla leader Robert Mugabe to break the Rhodesian fighting spirit . Pretoria feared that an escalation of the war would prompt direct Cuban and Russian involvement , just as had happened in the Angolan war . <p> So Smith was compelled to utter the unsayable and accept majority rule ( though he never defined the term ) . White morale slumped . But the ensuing conference in Geneva collapsed and Vorster resumed military aid . More pilots and equipment were loaned , particularly aircraft such as Alouettes and Canberras which , because they were in both Rhodesian and South African arsenals , could be passed off as Rhodesian weapons . One of the most vital forms of assistance was the loan of army signallers , who formed V Troop ' . This unit eavesdropped on nearly all the guerrilla and host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the South African defence minister , had always tried to back Ian Smith to the hilt , but Vorster and particularly his eminence grise , the intelligence chief Hendrik van den Bergh , spiked some of Botha 's more adventurous plans to intervene in Rhodesia , as well as in Angola and Mozambique . When Botha became prime minister in September 1978 , South African equipment and troops ( often in Rhodesian uniform ) poured in . Large South African helicopters ( the French-supplied Pumas ) and the crack Reconnaissance Commandos took tart in Rhodesian cross-border raids ( externals ' in Rhodesian parlance ) , especially against guerrilla bases in Mozambique . In raids elsewhere , against Zambia and Angola , South African air force Mirage fighters stood in reserve should Russian- or Cuban-piloted MiGs have intervened . Numerous South African agents also infiltrated Rhodesia , and the local Special Branch was hard-pressed to keep these supposedly allied spies under surveillance . Pretoria also recruited widely to establish an extensive spy network for the time when Zimbabwe became independent . <p> The stage was now set for a rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had indeed prepared a conventional invasion plan for Russia 's proteges , Joshua Nkomo 's army , based in Zambia . Nkomo 's better-trained troops formed , with Mugabe 's guerrillas , the Patriotic Front alliance which was dedicated to destroying white minority rule . <p> By mid- 1979 , 95 per cent of Rhodesia was under martial law . In effect , the senior generals , led by Lieutenant-General Peter Walls , who had served in the Black Watch , and Ken Flower of the CIO , a Cornishman , were running the country behind the facade of the new prime minister , Bishop Muzorewa . The bishop had emerged victorious from the elections of April 1979 , which had been boycotted by the Patriotic Front . Ian Smith , however , was still in the Cabinet , as Minister without Portfolio , or Minister with all the Portfolios ' , as Nkomo dubbed him . Hardliners in the Rhodesian Front still insisted that the war could be won militarily ; under Muzorewa the raids on the neighbouring states were intensified , but already large swathes of the country could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were no formal liberated areas inside Rhodesia , but government infrastructure  --  schools , clinics , animal dip-tanks and local government  --  had been wiped out in the more isolated native reserves ' or Tribal Trust Lands , where most of the approximately six million Africans lived . Guerrilla commissars , especially in eastern Rhodesia , along the long porous border with Mozambique , were building up rudimentary administrative systems to support Mugabe 's Zimbabwe African National Union ( ZANU ) party . The Marxist government in Mozambique fully backed Mugabe and sent in at least 500 Mozambican regular troops to assist ZANU inside Rhodesia . White power was being swamped by the sheer numbers of the guerrillas . As one member of the elite Selous Scouts put it , after a major raid into Mozambique in 1979 : We knew then that we could never beat them . They had so much equipment and there were so many of them . They would just keep coming with more and more . ' <p> Short of international recognition and the removal of sanctions , Muzorewa 's shaky government , controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could not have survived for perhaps more than another year . Only massive South African military intervention could have propped it up , but that might have prompted the kind of Eastern bloc conventional assault that so concerned Pretoria . The South African government never recognised the Smith or Muzorewa regimes , nor did any other state . The vital factor was always British recognition . Despite the fact that a Conservative observer group officially acknowledged the fairness of the April 1979 election , the new British Prime Minister , Margaret Thatcher , refused to accord diplomatic recognition to Muzorewa 's government . That was the bishop 's death knell . <p> At the ensuing Lancaster House Conference he was persuaded , despite Smith 's adamant opposition , to resign . In December 1979 Lord Soames took over as governor : the first time in the long imperial recessional that a colonial official had replaced an African president . Senior security officials such as Walls and Flower had played an important part in persuading the Rhodesian politicians that the war was lost and that only a political compromise could forestall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and international role in forging a settlement , despite the last-ditch opposition of Rhodesian Front politicians . In this paradoxical sense , military intervention was required to maintain the Clausewitzian paradigm of civilian supremacy . <p> Walls and Flower , despite their mutual personal antagonism , ensured that the Lancaster House Agreement remained in force throughout the difficult period of the ceasefire and finally Mugabe 's overwhelming electoral victory . Smith was shunted aside , while Walls and Flower played at being diplomats in London , South Africa and Mozambique . Then came the final test of their politicking : the prevention of the alleged coup in March 1980 . Despite the fact that many bitter Rhodesian soldiers and policemen still believe that an elaborately planned coup was aborted , in fact there was no formal coup de main waiting for the blue touch paper to be lit . There were a number of contingency plans to prevent a pre-emptive assault by Mugabe 's men and another one to annihilate the ZANU guerrillas in their ceasefire assembly points should they have refused to accept the verdict of the February 1980 elections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South Africans and the presumed passive assistance of Mugabe 's ally and rival , Nkomo , whose guerrillas were not a target . But there does not appear to be any evidence that the Rhodesians deliberately planned to stage a coup to stop Mugabe from winning . The official intelligence line , despite warnings from Special Branch to the contrary , was that Mugabe would not win a majority of seats . Contingency schemes existed for bogus ballot boxes to be stuffed with pro-Muzorewa ballots and there were four semi-official assassination operations planned or activated to kill Mugabe , including one at Lancaster House . But no elaborate coup plot emerged , for the simple reason that nearly every Rhodesian decision-maker firmly believed that Mugabe would not win , and nor would the British let him . They were convinced that London had concocted the ABM plan : Anybody But Mugabe ' . When he did win , many Rhodesians felt utterly betrayed . They argued that the elections had been fraudulent , mainly because of the massive intimidation . Full details of such charges came a little later . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against unconstitutional action . He told his staff at the Combined Operations HQ in Salisbury that Rhodesia will not copy the rest of Africa ' . <p> In April 1980 Zimbabwe became independent . A right-wing Conservative prime minister had caused , probably by accident , the first electoral triumph of a Marxist in Africa . White Rhodesians had hated Wilson in the 1960s , now their loathing was focused on Thatcher 's foreign secretary , the peer who had stage-managed the Lancaster House marathon : Peter Carrington . To many Rhodesians , Lancaster House and the following elections had been a stab in the back , another Munich . They had not been defeated , but cheated . Carrington was a second Chamberlain . According to the Rhodesian Assistant Secretary of Defence , Carrington had separately and definitively promised both Mugabe and Muzorewa that London unofficially supported each man . In Carrington 's view , ' the defence official said , the only way to stop the fighting was to hand over to Mugabe . It was a convenient way of getting rid of the problem . It was dishonest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With hindsight , however , it could be argued that Carrington 's diplomacy was astute : the main contenders in the election acquiesced in the British-supervised programme only because each man was convinced he could win . Nevertheless , it was ironic that a namesake , Major-General Sir Frederick Carrington , had presided over the consolidation of white power in Rhodesia in 1896 , after the first Chimurenga . ( The guerrillas referred to the fighting in the 1970s as the second , or continuing , Chimurenga . ) Symbolically , what one Carrington gave , another took away . Or such was the judgement of white Conservatives in Rhodesia . In another perspective , Lancaster House had ended the war and perhaps saved white Rhodesians from the worst excesses of their own folly . <p> White Rhodesia had been a suburb masquerading as a country . The whites had numbered , at their peak , just 275,000 . They had spat into the winds of change and the rebellion was terminated after much bloodshed . But the Rhodesians were not defeated militarily , although they would have been , despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces is one of tactical brilliance and strategic ineptitude . Rarely in military chronicles have such thinly-stretched troops , hampered by chronic manpower , training , equipment and financial constraints achieved such consistent successes against enemy forces which enjoyed the tactical and strategic initiative for most of the war , and often reached numerical parity in the field . But the Rhodesian obsession with successful operational techniques created a fatal blindness to the strategic and political imperatives required to counter a protracted insurgency . The initial aim of the war was to prevent the passing of power to any black government , no matter how moderate . An admission of racism , if only within the high command and Cabinet , might have produced a more coherent grand strategy , but no clear political programme  --  beyond a vague preservation of the status quo  --  was ever articulated . Rhodesian grand strategy , such as it was , was shot through with a fatal negativism . There was little faith in far-reaching reform as a war-winner . Such a recognition , of course , would have undermined the very reasons for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggled long and hard against the only thing which could have avoided war  --  African participation in national politics . To change horses in mid-stream was extremely difficult , but the Rhodesians did try it : the war shifted from a confrontation with the principle of black majority rule to a war for the sort of black government white Rhodesians were prepared to live under . But once the principle of having any kind of majority rule at all was conceded , the Rhodesians ' war aims became increasingly confused and their strategy consistently weaker . <p> Faced with the inner weaknesses of their strategies , the Rhodesians resorted to more and more desperate measures . The policy of winning hearts and minds ' was largely abandoned in the field just as the first moves towards a political strategy of a moderate black government were coming to fruition . Perversely , it was considered that black participation in the political process would permit tougher , war-winning operations . Martial law was extended , the punitive destruction of villages and livestock of those who were accused of aiding the guerrillas became routine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one senior officer at Combined Operations admitted : We relied 90 per cent on force and 10 percent on psychology and half of that went off half-cock . The guerrillas relied 90 percent on psychology and only 10 percent on force . ' The insurgents had a clear vision of their purpose : to break the back of white supremacy and establish a black majority government . This gave the guerrillas remarkable stamina and their cause the strength to weather numerous political crises and almost consistent military defeat in the field . The apparent simplicity of the guerrilla objectives did , however , mask enormous confusion and conflict as to how to achieve those objectives . At times , dissension among the nationalists was far more potent than the fire power of the Rhodesians in delaying majority rule . Nevertheless , despite being clothed in the ferocious Asian garb of a people 's war , the guerrillas accomplished what Marxists would term a bourgeois nationalist revolution ' . <p> After the war some Rhodesians insisted that the war had been winnable . They asserted that detente in the mid-1970s had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been indefinitely imprisoned or shot , and that the guerrilla bases in the frontline states should have been obliterated in the early 1970s . War is war , ' argued the die-hards , so why did n't we bomb Lusaka or do a " dam-buster " on the massive Cahora Bassa dam and knock out Mozambique in one single blow ? ' Such an escalation , as we have seen , depended upon the wholehearted support of Pretoria which was never forth-coming . Any successful long-term containment of the guerrillas would have been dependent upon diplomatic recognition and military aid from the West . Yet that would never have been given to a white-dominated government . If a plausible political solution-perhaps an assertive Muzorewa administration in 1976 - had been gracefully conceded by the Rhodesian Front , then Anglo-American military backing might have led to a defeat of the Patriotic Front , if the guerrillas had chosen to fight on . But . in the pattern of all colonial wars , the Rhodesians always gave too little , far too late . <p> Sanctions , too , played a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the pressure of the guerrilla war . Initially , economic constraints were merely a nuisance : shortages of razor blades , ladies ' stockings and good whisky resulted ; and , as Flower points out in his memoirs , the Salisbury Club ran out of port for the first time since 1896 . By the late 1970s sanctions were undoubtedly biting . They did contribute to winding down the morale of the whites and prompting emigration , thus draining the life-blood of white military manpower . <p> Most of the consequences of sanctions were unintended . While privileged whites suffered a loss of perhaps ten Rhodesian dollars per capita per annum , most of the hardships were shifted on to the poorest blacks , particularly in the Tribal Trust Lands and the neighbouring black states . Sanctions polarised the political spectrum : whites became more intransigent ; but , similarly , black peasants became radicalised as they slipped deeper into poverty and into the propaganda grip of the guerrillas . The incomplete sanctions against Rhodesia generated international credibility and legitimacy for the liberation movements , created a far more radicalised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspired the conditions for the victory of the most revolutionary black contender for power , a far cry from making the whites bend the knee in a few months as Wilson had predicted . <p> Pretoria , particularly in 1976 , was also instrumental in forcing Smith to compromise . War , sanctions , propaganda and Pretoria overwhelmed the rebellion , but its repercussions still reverberate throughout southern Africa . Mugabe 's accession to power emphasised the basic tenet of pan-Africanism : that Africa can not be truly free until the whole continent is purged of white supremacy . <p> Many questions about the war still remain unanswered , especially concerning the intelligence and dirty-tricks operations . The Rhodesians meddled in many other conflicts , ranging from the Biafran struggle to the civil wars in Angola and Mozambique as well as sponsoring coupe , such as in the Comores . They dabbled with chemical warfare and prompted a number of high- level assassinations , although whether the death in 1979 of the senior ZANU military commander , Josiah Tongogara , was murder by Rhodesians or his own men , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the intrigue associated with sanctions ' evasion remains undisclosed , although recent events in Eastern Europe may soon open up archives there to researchers . A large amount of the Rhodesian documentation on the war was destroyed just before Mugabe took over , or spirited away to South Africa . Much of that information detailed South African involvement . There , too , a great deal more needs to be said . <p> As most writers on the Rhodesian war admit , the saga needs a comprehensive , balanced treatment . By general consensus the Rhodesian tragedy awaits the kind of treatment Alistair Horne gave the Algerian war in his masterly A Savage War of Peace . Just possibly , that might avoid another hundred years ' war of words between future historians of Rhodesia 's futile defiance . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Gesture politics ; Ian Smith signing Rhodesia 's unilateral declaration of independence ' , November 1965 .

While the Malay elite held administrative positions and ordinary Malays continued to subsist on fishing and small scale agriculture , the British imported Chinese labor primarily from Fujian and Guandong provinces to work as traders and in tin mines and Indian labor to work in the bureaucracy and on rubber plantations . This division of labor stemming from the British colonial legacy is mirrored in the contemporary stereotyping of Malaysian ethnic identities -- Malays control politics , Chinese control economics , and Indians are prominent in manual labor on plantations and in the professions ( Lockwood 2003 , Nagata 1997 ) . <p> At the end of the 19th century , many Hadramouts ( from what is today Yemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Singapore and started to question the Islamic legitimacy of the rule of the Malay sultans and the form of Islam practiced by ordinary Malays .

The British returned with a proposal for a new policy treating the three ethnic groups equally that would undermine any remaining political authority of the sultans . This proposal , though never implemented , heightened popular Malay resentment of the Chinese as did the formation of predominantly Chinese communist rebel groups ( Nagata 1997 , Voll 1994 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties formed and led an anti-British movement . In 1945 , the Malayan National Party ( MNP ) , the precursor of today 's leading Islamic political party PAS ( Parti Islam Se-Malaysia ) , was established . The following year the United Malays ' National Organization ( UMNO ) formed . Both groups advocated Malay preeminence and were anti-communist ( Voll 1994 ) . <p> These two parties answered the identity question of " who is the Malay ? " differently . The MNP defined Malayness in terms of religion , race , and language . In contrast , UMNO used race , language , and custom . The place of Islam for Malay identity , then , became the defining difference between the MNP ( now PAS ) and UMNO and continues to shape the identity politics in Malaysia ( Safi n.d. ) . ( n2 ) <p> Over the next decade , UMNO , which formed an alliance with the noncommunist Chinese and Indian elites , became the leading Malay political party . This coalition swept national elections in 1955 and has ruled Malaysia , then Malaya , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Singapore joined in 1963 and Singapore withdrew in 1965 leaving Malaysia in its current configuration ( Voll 1994 ) . <p> Early Malay activism focused around Malay language rights , e.g. , the use of Bahasa Malayu rather than English as the official language of the country and in all governmental institutions . However , by the early 1970s , Islam became the central focus of debates over Malay identity ( Nagata 1997 , Voll 1994 ) . <p> Several events laid the foundations for the Islamic resurgence . The most dramatic triggering event was the Malay-Chinese race riots in 1969 . Malay-Chinese tensions remained hidden under the surface of peaceful cooperation for more than a decade after independence . However , on May 13 , 1969 , these Malay-Chinese tensions , held in check to that point by British authorities and the ruling alliance led by UMNO erupted into open conflict on the streets of Kuala Lumpur . These race riots stemmed from economic inequalities between the ethnic Malays and Chinese that originated from British colonial immigration and labor policies , and Chinese participation in the communist movement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government for maintaining inter-racial harmony , a key element underlying popular Malay support of secularist-leaning UMNO following independence ( Nagata 1997 , Voll 1994 ) . <p> The 1969 race riots demonstrated that a coalition government alone was insufficient to maintain inter-community harmony . One major response to these riots was the New Economic Policy ( NEP ) in 1970 . The NEP was designed to create national unity by attacking major sources of inter-community tensions . First , the NEP aimed to eradicate poverty regardless of race . Second , the NEP aimed to eliminate the linkages between race and economic function . This second aspect essentially provided the Malays with an affirmative action program that mandated quotas for ethnic Malays in education and hiring because they were economically worst off as a group . The overall strategy was to eliminate many of the barriers between ethnic groups thus promoting greater unity ( Government of Malaysia 1971 , Khoo Boo Teik 2003 , Williamson 2002 ) . <p> The NEP enabled thousands of Malays to study abroad where they encountered Muslim students from around the world . Many of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Association ) in the United States and returned to Malaysia with a stronger sense of their identity as Muslims . The ideas of Muslim activists and scholars like Ismail Al-Faruqi , S. H. Nasr , Sayyid Qutb , Hassan Al-Banna , and Ali Shariati also returned in these students minds as well as in printed form . Syed Naquib Al-Attas , an Indonesian born and Euro-American educated Malaysian scholar of Hadramout descent , also became influential from his post at the University of Malaya ( Voll 1994 ) . <p> The dakwah movement also emerged at this time . " Dakwah " is the Malay term used to describe a wide variety of Islamically oriented Malay groups of which the most influential is ABIM ( Angkatan Belia Islam Malaysia or Malay Muslim Youth League ) . ABIM was founded by Anwar Ibrahim around the issue of Malay language rights before shifting towards an Islamic focus . In 1982 , Anwar accepted an invitation from the then newly elected Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and joined UMNO . Anwar 's Islamic credentials legitimized UMNO in the face of the Islamic revival and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " became official government policy in 1984 ( Lotfalian 1999 ) . <p> The 1980s and 1990s saw the implementation of a number of formal and informal Islamically-oriented government sponsored programs including an Islamic Bank , a Shariah judicial system parallel to the secular judicial system , the International Islamic University , the National Mosque , and the general encouragement of integrating Islamic symbolism into architectural designs . During the same period , however , the government has also cracked down on many Islamic organizations . This seemingly contradictory behavior should be interpreted as the UMNO led government 's co-optation of Islam and Islamic symbolism for its own purposes , including battles with PAS and other Islamic groups and individuals over Malay and Malaysian identity . This brings us full circle to Malaysian modernity . <p> L : Malaysian Modernity and the New Malay For the Malaysian government , economic development , first in the form of the National Economic Policy ( NEP ) and later the National Development Policy ( NDP ) that was incorporated into Vision 2020 , is in a very real sense a social policy designed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a process that Benedict Anderson ( 1991 ) described as creating an imagined community . <p> Mahathir 's Vision 2020 is now 15 years into a 30-year long plan . Originating as an address to the Malaysian Business Council in 1991 titled " The Way Forward , " Mahathir ( 1991 ) outlined what he meant by a fully developed nation and how his definition differed from Western definitions that relied solely on economic criteria . Mahathir 's definition included all aspects of society . This is clearly evident in " The Way Forward " and in the 1995 book The Voice of Asia co-authored with Shitaro Ishihara , who was then Prime Minister of Japan , in which Mahathir stated ( 1995:20 ) : <p> In formulating Vision 2020 , we had to define what we meant by " developed country . " Does the term refer simply to a per capita income of at least US$16,000 , or does it also imply stability and solid cultural values ? All these factors have to be considered , but it is clear that wealth alone does not constitute development . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has money but no technology ... . Nor is a country developed , in our sense of the word , if it has money and technology but lacks firm moral values . Many Western societies , for example , are morally decadent . There is diminishing respect for the institutions of the family and marriage , and some even permit same-gender marriages . To us , that is not development . You must maintain cultural and moral values . We do not want to be just a rich country . <p> For Mahathir , then , developed status requires three things : money , technology , and moral values . Moral values are critical to combat Westernization in both a general sense and in the sense of what many Malaysians view as a decline in moral values associated with the rise of modernity in the West . <p> Gaonkar ( 2001 ) , for example , identifies two strands of modernity in classic social theory derived from studies of the West : ( 1 ) societal modernization and ( 2 ) cultural modernity . Societal modernization involves both social and cognitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutionalization of market-driven industrial economies , bureaucratically administered states , modes of popular government , rule of law , mass media , and increased mobility , literacy , and urbanization " ( Gaonkar 2001:2 ) . The cognitive transformations include " the growth of scientific consciousness , the development of a secular outlook , the doctrine of progress , the primacy of instrumental rationality , the fact-value split , individualistic understandings of the self , contractualist understandings of society , and so on " ( Gaonkar 2001:1-2 ) . The societal modernization strand of modernity is linked to the development of capitalism in the West and is well described by Max Weber ( 1958 1904 ) among others . This view of modernity corresponds well to Vision 2020 's plans for economic and technoscientific development though it does not address the question of values . <p> Cultural modernity rose in opposition to societal modernization primarily in the aesthetic realm of literature and art beginning in the late eighteenth century and expanded via the popular media , entertainment , commercial arts , and advertising . Advocates of cultural modernity turned away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and experiential transgressions of middle class norms and sensibilities . Baudelaire 's valorization of modernity as " the transient , the fleeting , the contingent " condition of everyday life in opposition to the contemplative , the eternal , and the idealized --  " nearly all our originality comes from the stamp that time impresses upon our sensibility " ( cited in Gaonkar 2001:4 )  - -  exemplifies well the notion of cultural modernity . Baudelaire 's vision celebrates the spectacle and novelty of modern life . However , Baudelaire 's modernity can also lapse into narcissism and hedonism due to its lack of normative limits . This is the type of modernity and Westernization that Mahathir and most Malaysians fear and which accounts for the centrality of values in all the discourses of modernity in Malaysia . <p> For Vision 2020 to succeed , Malaysia 's GDP must average 8% growth annually over the 30 years of the plan . In order to achieve this , according to Mahathir , requires a transformation to a knowledge-based economy ( or K-economy ) . <p> Science and technology are central to Malaysia 's plans to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and development , and infrastructure are important locations for government investment . Among the government 's investments in infrastructure are the new Kuala Lumpur International Airport ( KLIA ) , a Light Rail Transit ( LRT ) monorail in and around Kuala Lumpur , a second Proton factory ( Proton is the national car manufactured in cooperation with Mitsubishi ) , Putrajaya ( Malaysia 's new capital ) and the Multimedia Super Corridor ( MSC ) . <p> Of particular note is the MSC , designed to attract high-tech , multinational corporations and push Malaysia into the forefront of the information based economies of the 21st century . The MSC is a centerpiece of national pride and symbolizes Malaysia 's modernization program . Stretching 50 km from Kuala Lumpur to KLIA and Cyberjaya ( a brand new , totally wired Cyber city ) and 15 km wide , the MSC is projected to cost approximately RM50 billion and represents a huge investment for a nation of 22 million people with a 1998 federal budget of just over RM64 billion or just under US$17 billion. ( n3 ) <p> In a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its physical infrastructure ) is easier to accomplish than remaking Malaysian identity . Building the MSC with its smart schools in smart cities located on former agricultural plantations primarily requires capital ( substantial as that may be ) to build facilities designed by a relatively small group of Malaysian and foreign businesspeople , thinkers , scientists , and engineers using new but fairly established technology imported from abroad . Remaking the Malaysians to thrive in such an environment while retaining their cultural and moral values seems a much larger challenge . <p> The question of Malay nationalism is intertwined with and at times at loggerheads with the goal of national unity and creating a Malaysian identity . The NDP and Vision 2020 extend the economic and structural goals of the NEP to the remaking of the Malay identity . The success of Malaysia 's economic and social transformations requires a transformation in Malay identity to what the popular press has characterized as a new breed of Malay and Mahthir has called the " Melayu Baru " or " New Malay " ( Thompson 2003 ) . According to Mahathir , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rational , and tolerant Muslim who can combat neo-colonialism while simultaneously understanding and developing Malaysia 's new information based technologies and economy . The new Malay also conforms to descriptions of modern citizens in classic social theory in that the new Malay is an urbanized participant in the industrialized economy and is entrepreneurial ( Thompson 2003 ) . <p> This image of the new Malay represents a complete rupture with the earlier image of the Malay peasant living in a kampung ( village ) surviving by subsistence farming and fishing . Mahathir ( 1970 ) has been highly critical of Malay peasants . Despite this , he argues that Malays must retain their cultural and moral values as they otherwise transform themselves into New Malays . What , however , are these cultural and moral values that need to be retained ? <p> L : Old and New Malay Values Mahathir is a leading advocate for " Asian values . " The notion of Asian values developed from the earlier concept " Confucian values " promoted in the 1970s by then Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew and others as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Singapore , Hong Kong , and Taiwan . The transformation to Asian values emerged as Asian economies increasingly integrated and regional groups like the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) were formed and as Japanese foreign direct investment increased . <p> For Mahathir , Asian values like hard work , family , and community solidarity are central to Malaysian development . In order to promote Asian values among the citizenry of Malaysia , the Ministry of Education in its Integrated Curriculum has identified sixteen " universal values " which the ministry believes are compatible with all religions , cultures , and norms of Malaysian society and are to be inculcated in all disciplines including in specific moral and Islamic education courses which make up 10% of instruction time at the primary level and 14% at the secondary level . These values are : compassion/empathy , self-reliance , humility/modesty , respect , love , justice , freedom , courage , cleanliness of body and mind , honesty/integrity , diligence , co-operation , moderation , gratitude , rationality , and public spiritedness ( Hashim 1996 ) . <p> The Malaysian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and technology at the National Science Center . The recently opened National Science Center located in the suburbs of Kuala Lumpur is a museum that emphasizes hands-on exhibits attractive to children and exhibits that document the contributions of Muslim scientists and engineers . Indeed , even the architectural design , which resembles a mosque without minarets , reflects government efforts to link technoscientific development and cultural and moral values . <p> This linkage is made extraordinarily clear as one walks into the large exhibition space under the glass dome . Straight ahead is an exhibit on space exploration that includes information on Malaysia 's first communications satellite while flying high above is a large , traditional Malay kite . The message is obvious -- we may have started off from humble roots , but we have come far and can achieve even greater things . <p> Indeed , much of the new skyline of Kuala Lumpur is architecturally designed to link Islamic values explicitly to the urban landscape . The Petronas twin towers and the KL Tower are prime examples . Both structures draw on traditional Islamic symbolism and motifs while their functions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industries . The twin towers house the Petronas oil company and an immense shopping mall at their base , while the KL Tower serves as a communications relay tower. ( n4 ) <p> While the values listed above hardly contradict Western norms and values , Mahathir ( 1995 ) devotes a chapter to the contrasts he sees between " Western Modernism and Eastern Thought . " Mahathir argues that the West has separated religious and secular life and replaced religious values with hedonistic ones like materialism , sensual gratification , and selfishness that are leading the West to " an impending collapse " ( 1995:81 ) . <p> This belief makes Mahathir 's decision to build the MSC even more daring . Because the development of a knowledge-based economy requires the free flow of information and ideas on a global scale , Mahathir has no choice but to allow the Western ideas and consumerism that he fears into Malaysia via the internet and other communication media . Mahathir has no choice because he needs the assistance of global corporations and their capital if the MSC is to succeed . And one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a policy of no censorship of the internet. ( n5 ) <p> Mahathir and other Malaysians developing the MSC recognize many potential implications , both benefits and dangers , inherent with a free flow of information . Azzman Sheriffadeen , a Malaysian CEO and futurist trained in engineering , recognizes that the MSC can contribute immensely to the Malaysian economy because information technology services are not spacially constrained . Thus , these services can be produced anywhere ( in this case in Malaysia ) and consumed globally due to the cheap and unfettered flow of information via the internet and other communication media ( Azzman Shariffadeen 1994 ) . <p> Azzman Shariffadeen also recognizes the social implications of the free flow of information : " Knowledge is a double-edged sword . Improper use can lead to destruction -- destruction of self , society , or even civilizations " ( Azzman Shariffadeen 1997:10 ) . He also states that social , cultural , and political institutions and mechanisms do not exist to counter the potential abuse of knowledge . However , in the end , he believes that if the citizenry is enculturated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiment can enable a transformation of Malaysian society along utopian lines , meaning a self-regulating society with unlimited access to information in which rulers are wise and citizens actively participate in their own governance -- a society in which human dignity forms the foundation for individuals ' rights not to live in poverty or hunger ( Azzman Shariffadeen 1997 ) . <p> L : The Discontents There are voices , however , within Malaysia , opposed to Mahathir 's vision for Malaysian modernity . This does not mean that they want Malaysia to reject economic , technological , or social development , nor does it mean that they want Malaysia to be Westernized . Rather , these discontents , if you will , have a different interpretation of which values ought to be valorized , promoted , and acted out . The fault line between Malaysian modernity and its discontents should not be dismissed simply as a political struggle for power between Mahathir and the ousted and then jailed former Deputy Prime Minister and heir apparent Anwar Ibrahim . While this is certainly an important aspect of the disagreements over Malaysian modernity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Malay and Malaysian identity . At a very fundamental level , the issues in the struggle for political control of Malaysia and the questions of Malay and Malaysian identity are the same . What role can and should Islam play in the contemporary world and specifically in Malaysia ? And how does one define Islam ? <p> One of the leading discontents is Chandra Muzaffar . Muzaffar was a professor at the University of Malaya until he was fired in the wake of the Anwar controversy . He has been an outspoken human rights activist for some time and is now the vice president of the opposition National Justice Party ( Keadilan ) led by Anwar and his wife Wan Aziza . <p> Muzaffar has been critical of many government policies . In a position paper , Muzaffar ( 1996 ) addressed the Asian values debate . He made the point that the values cited as Asian , e.g. , hard work , discipline , thriftiness , family solidarity , community cohesiveness , and loyalty to authority are only partly responsible for Asian economic growth , are not uniquely Asian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Asians hold . He notes that other factors like the circulation of Japanese capital in East Asia , focus on human resource development , the existence of sound infrastructural facilities , emphasis on export oriented industrialization , and general peace and stability in the region were also important in East Asian development He notes that while these values may be on the decline in the West in the face of individualism they are not limited to Asians . And most importantly , Muzaffar notes that these economic and political values described as Asian ignore other Asian values derived from religion . He calls for a re-interpretation of religious doctrine in order to emphasize the " universal spiritual worldview and its perennial moral values " in each religion in order to foster inter-civilizational dialogue including Western secularism . Muzaffar ( 1996 ) concludes : " When such a transformed , reformed religion becomes a way of life , Asian values will cease to be synonymous with hard work or loyalty to authority , and will be equated , as it sic should be , with justice , compassion and love . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that Mahathir 's Asian values were nothing more than a screen to hide the fact that Mahathir is a " crass capitalist " who uses old , anti-colonialist rhetoric to stay in power rather than being the great nationalist and anti-colonialist he represents himself as . Muzaffar said that Mahathir 's real Asian values were what he called the " 6 Ms " : money , market , machines , media , mega-ism , and Mahathirism . This then is Muzaffar 's alternative characterization of Malaysian modernity ( Personal communication ) . <p> According to Muzaffar , Islam is also a screen for Mahathir . Mahathir has instituted a system of Islamic banks operating without interest to complement the extent banks . He was also instrumental in Malaysia 's opening of the International Islamic University of Malaysia ( IIUM ) in cooperation with the Organization of Islamic Conference ( OIC ) . However , Muzaffar views these actions as cynical moves to maintain popular support from ethnic Malays as Islam has become increasingly important for ethnic Malay identity ( Personal communication ) . <p> In contrast , Muzaffar believes Anwar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The distinction Muzaffar draws between Asian economic and political values and universalistic moral and religious values is similar to the differences between Mahathir 's Asian values and Anwar 's Asian renaissance concept . According to Anwar ( 1996:17-18 ) : <p> By Asian Renaissance we mean the revival of the arts and sciences under the influence of the classical models based on strong moral and religious foundations ; a cultural resurgence dominated by a reflowering of art and literature , architecture and music and advancements in science and technology . <p> Thus , Anwar 's vision of society is founded not upon economic and political imperatives but upon education and religious values . <p> Two other oppositional political parties vocally oppose Malaysian modernity . The Parti Islam Se-Malaysia ( PAS ) is the main Islamically-oriented party and a direct descendent of the first political party founded in Malaysia and older by a year or so than Mahathir 's party , the United Malay National Organization ( UMNO ) , which has ruled continuously since independence in 1957 . PAS has long called for an Islamic state . While PAS has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the institutionalization of Shariah ( Islamic law ) , it is gaining popular support among ethnic Malays and now controls two state governments . PAS is concerned about UMNO 's Islamic commitment in policy . This concern is not new originating as it does with PAS 's and UMNO 's definition of " Malay . " PAS argued for religion , race , and language as the criteria , while UMNO argued for race , language , and custom . However , this charge has a new salience given Anwar 's 1998 ousting and imprisonment since most Malays saw him as the main source of Islamic legitimacy within UMNO . <p> As was noted previously , recently retired longtime Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and the Malaysian government have used the Islamic University and similar large-scale projects like the building of mosques and instituting an Islamic banking system to legitimize the government with Malay Muslims . Another strategy for legitimation with this constituency was bringing Anwar Ibrahim into the government apparently with the urging and support of Ismail Al-Faruqi who was a consultant on Islamic and educational concerns for the Malaysian government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . n6 Anwar has been strongly influenced by the ideas of the IIIT and by other leading proponents of Islamic science like S.H . Nasr and Syed Naquib Al-Attas . <p> The second opposition party is the Democratic Action Party ( DAP ) . Though it is not officially an ethnically-based party like UMNO , DAP is the primary Chinese opposition party . DAP has challenged Mahathir and UMNO regarding the inclusiveness of its policies towards non-Malays . Why for example is Mahathir concerned about creating the so-called New Malay they ask ? What about the ethnic Chinese , Indians , and indigenous peoples that together make-up roughly half of Malaysia 's citizens ? And while there remain serious differences among the opposition parties , not least of which is the role of Islam and Shariah in governing Malaysia , the three opposition parties are working together . <p> L : IIUM The International Islamic University , Malaysia ( IIUM ) was founded in 1983 by the government of Malaysia and co-sponsored by the Organization of Islamic Conference ( OIC ) specifically in order to integrate Islamic values and knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malaysia ( Nagata 1984 ) . IIUM is a site at which the discourses of Vision 2020 , alternative Malaysian discourses , and Malaysian and global Islamic discourses intersect as IIUM explicitly attempts to integrate knowledge and Islamic values . Educational institutions in the Muslim world are excellent sites in which to examine discursive relationships among Islam , modernity , globalization , and identity grounded within a highly localized setting as Lukens-Bull ( Lukens-Bull 2005 ) has demonstrated for Java and for similar reasons that Peletz ( 2002 ) suggests for the case of Islamic courts in Malaysia . Thus , IIUM provides an ideal site within which to examine the tensions present in attempts to construct a Malaysian modernity , Malaysian identity , and Malay identity . <p> In 1984 , the Third International Conference on the Islamization of Knowledge convened in Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia . Co-sponsored by the IIIT and the Malaysian Ministry of Youth and Culture , this conference was also important for bringing the IIIT 's ideas to Malaysia . One participant at this conference was Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad who stated his support for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Following the success of the Malaysian conference , the IIIT opened a branch office in Malaysia associated with IIUM . As Minister of Education , Anwar became the President of IIUM and recruited AbdulHamid AbuSulayman from the IIIT to become Rector of the university and run the day-to-day operations in 1988 . The IIIT even briefly considered moving their headquarters to Malaysia in the mid-1990s. ( n7 ) <p> The goal of integrating knowledge and Islamic values is quite evident in Anwar Ibrahim 's " President 's Message " in the IIUM catalog where he talks about the importance of revitalizing the intellectual tradition of the ummah , integrating Islamic learning as a basis for intellectual creativity , and integrating Islamic and world oriented approaches in each individual 's personality . According to Anwar Ibrahim ( International Islamic University Malaysia 1998:v ) : <p> The survival of the Muslim civilisation will and must be a work of scholarship , a scholarship that is not merely abstract but also informed by and sensitive to the pressing problems and concerns of the world in which we live . Knowledge is the most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not equip themselves to succeed and thrive in the new economy of knowledge they will fall further behind . If Muslims do not learn how to enter the new economy of knowledge through the conceptual world of Islam they consign themselves to a future that is as fractured and problem ridden as has been our recent past . <p> It is also clear that the discourse of Vision 2020/Malaysian modernity has shaped greatly the discourse of legitimation of IIUM . Islam is good not just for individual Muslims , it is critical for success in the new global economy . In the first paragraph on page one the catalog states ( International Islamic University Malaysia 1998:1 ) : <p> IIUM regards knowledge as a trust from Allah to be utilised , in accordance with his guidance , for the benefit of life ... By integrating sources of revealed knowledge with an arts and sciences curriculum the University contributes both to the enrichment of the intellectual tradition and the advancement of the individual and society . <p> And furthermore , the longest subsection in the " General Information " section is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs a graduate from each of the kulliyas or colleges might expect . <p> The mission of IIUM intersects with the goals of Vision 2020 and with the plan to reconstruct Malay identity . At the same time , however , they are not identical . While Mahathir may view the mission of IIUM as producing Malaysian and particularly Malay citizens with 21st century skill sets accompanied by Islamic values , the goal of IIUM is unifying Islamic values and knowledge and instilling this unified Islamic orientation or world view in students -- Muslim Malay students , Muslim international students , and potentially to non-Muslim Malaysian students as well . The intersection of these overlapping but differing agendas has created difficulties at IIUM of accomplishing their primary goal -- providing a curriculum that unifies Islamic values and knowledge and instilling it in students . <p> The situation is further complicated in that at least two different strands of Islamization of knowledge are represented at IIUM . The first and more dominant strand is the IOK derived from Ismail Al-Faruqi and the IIIT . The second strand is present in the thought of Syed Naquib Al-Attas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Civilization ( ISTAC ) , a special , fully autonomous post-graduate teaching and research unit attached to IIUM when I was there. n8 I first examine the situation at IIUM in general before examining the specific case of ISTAC . <p> At IIUM , the exact mechanism of the integration of Islam and knowledge is still being worked out . In theory , the integration takes place through a combination of required courses on Islamic civilization , Islamic content in all courses , and informal sessions held weekly . However , in practice this model has had mixed results at best . Initially , the Center for Fundamental Knowledge ( CFK ) organized and taught the formal core courses on Islamic civilization , implemented compulsory weekly halaqah tarbiyah al-Islamiya ( Islamic education meetings ) , and ' ibadah seminars held each semester . The CFK became the Department of Islamic Revealed Knowledge and Heritage in the Kulliyah of Islamic Revealed Knowledge and Human Sciences ( IRKHS ) as IIUM expanded from 180 students into a major university . And while the department now offers its own degree program , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Amin 1997 ) . <p> Few of the faculty members I spoke with about how they operationalized the integration of Islam and knowledge in the courses they taught even said they made a substantive effort in this direction . In many courses , the Islamization of the curriculum meant assigning one or two relevant IIIT publications or then rector AbuSulayman 's ( 1993 ) book Crisis in the Muslim Mind. n9 One professor of sociology and anthropology who taught for 30 years in the United States before accepting a post at IIUM told me that he taught his courses exactly as he taught them in the United States and he gave me syllabi for courses on Criminology and Deviant Behavior as evidence ( Personal communication ) . <p> One non-Muslim graduate student in political science told me that until she took the course " Islamization of Political Science , " which I also attended , she had no idea what IIUM meant when they said " Islamization " because all of her courses were similar to courses she took at the secular university where she had completed her undergraduate degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She said she came to IIUM to get a Masters degree and did not think about the Islamic orientation of the university at all when deciding where to apply and attend . Interestingly , a fellow political science graduate student who was Muslim and a friend of this woman did not know that she was not a Muslim until she told me this in her presence because she chose to wear a head scarf while at IIUM " out of respect " ( Personal communication ) . <p> In a detailed analysis of the Islamization of knowledge focusing on the economics department at IIUM , Haneef and Amin ( 1997 ) describe the decline in Islamic content and integration in the economics curriculum . For example , they noted that the core courses on Islamic civilization have been reduced from 22 credit hours to 12 credit hours . Similarly , they conducted content analysis on final exam questions in economics classes and found that while Islamic content was high in courses dealing specifically with economics from an Islamic perspective in courses dealing with " conventional , " i.e. non-Islamic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 1993-94 school years ( Haneef and Amin 1997 ) . <p> As the curriculum changed from a structured model in which students had to take particular courses during particular years and semesters of their studies to a flexible system in which students could take any course at anytime as long as they met the prerequisites , Haneef and Amin ( 1997 ) found that students ' attitudes towards the Islamic core courses had changed . In the former system , students took the required core courses on Islamic civilization early in their studies and could then more easily relate Islamic concepts to economics . With the institutionalization of the flexible system , students tended to delay taking the required Islamic courses until their final year and therefore had much less background in Islamic heritage to help them conceptualize the relevance of Islam to economics . At the same time , students started viewing the required economics courses as the essential core curriculum rather than the courses on Islamic civilization which they now viewed as unimportant or even " irrelevant . " As Haneef and Amin ( 1997 ) summarized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economics courses , considering them of direct relevance in their future careers . " <p> To a great extent , the administration recognizes and acknowledges this situation . At one point before I was in Malaysia , IIIT 's Malaysian office played an explicit advisory role . By the fall of 1998 , however , IIUM was relying on several faculty members who at one time or another had been associated with the IIIT or Association of Muslim Social Scientists . For example , Dr. M'hand Berkouk , an Algerian political scientist and Head of the Department of General Studies at IIUM , was developing faculty-training sessions on how to offer integrated courses . Berkouk became aware of IIIT when he was invited to participate in an IIIT conference at the University of Southampton in the United Kingdom where he was on the faculty . At the time , he was the only Muslim teaching political science in the United Kingdom . He enjoyed the intellectual environment at the conference and eventually became involved with IIIT 's London office and networking to establish the European Association of Muslim Social Scientists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his work with IIIT . He came to IIUM in September 1997 in order to get exposed to different ideas and develop a different side of his personality by learning more about Islam despite getting only 20% of his previous salary teaching at the University of Southampton. ( n10 ) <p> According to Berkouk , two special diploma programs were being developed for faculty in order to help them better integrate the social and human sciences with the Islamic sciences in their teaching . The first diploma program is for social and human science faculty in order to introduce them to the principles and methods of the Shariah sciences including : Qur'anic studies , Sunnah studies , Usul al-Din , Fiqh , and Usul al-Fiqh . The course will culminate with a seminar on the integration of knowledge . The " ultimate objective " of this diploma is " the Islamization of Knowledge with the aim to usher in an ideal world order for humanity at large . " ( n11 ) <p> The second diploma program is for faculty teaching in the Islamic revealed knowledge program . This diploma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods of the social and human sciences through six modules including : psychology , sociology and anthropology , political science , communications , social research methods , and comprehensive relational studies. n12 This course culminates in a seminar on the integration of knowledge as well . The goal of this diploma program is to enable faculty to " acquire and develop rational and integrated approaches to knowledge and teaching . " ( n13 ) <p> Each of these special diplomas consists of 120 contact hours with 80% attendance and passage of a final examination required to receive the diploma . The diploma programs were voluntary at first though plans called for them to become compulsory over time . Berkouk said that there was significant resistance to requiring the diplomas for faculty . However , in the end , the faculty senate agreed to the new initiative ( Personal communication ) . ( n14 ) <p> The difference between the goals of the two diploma programs is both interesting and illuminating . The goal of the diploma program for the social and human science faculty is both broad and utopian . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In contrast , the goal of the diploma program for the Islamic studies faculty is narrow and mundane -- essentially coming down to improving scholarship and teaching . The differences stem largely from the differences in the perspectives of the two faculties . Social and human scientists I spoke to at IIUM , and particularly faculty trained and previously living in the West , often noted that they came to IIUM and Malaysia in order to learn more about Islam and make a personal contribution to the success of Muslim civilization . For example , Berkouk 's comment about developing another side of his personality is relevant here . And while I do not have a specific example to support this claim , I suggest that the Islamic studies faculty holds attitudes more similar to that of PAS , the main Islamic party in Malaysia , which argues that the key to transforming society is the implementation of Shariah . <p> At the same time , Berkouk also said that a course for undergraduates that unified Islamic and social sciences was to be offered the following semester . This course would include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social science , Islamic methodology , and Islamic epistemology . Other courses on quantitative analysis and statistics from an Islamic perspective and " reformed Islamic sciences not traditional Islamic sciences " were planned for the following fall semester ( Personal communication ) . <p> In the fall of 1998 , however , with faculty training sessions and unified courses only on paper or at the discretion of individual professors , the primary means of providing students an Islamic perspective is through half-day required study sessions each Friday morning . Generally led by graduate students , the students I spoke to about these sessions were generally underwhelmed . According to students serious about Islam , these sessions were generally considered uninformative . According to students who were not serious about Islam , these sessions were generally considered time that could be better spent at study or recreation . <p> Students often also participate in student organized and led halaqah groups which read , memorize , and discuss the Qur'an . I attended several sessions of one halaqah group . The group at any particular session consisted of between six and eight students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of primarily international students studying at IIUM though there was at least one Malay member . The group met once a week on Friday afternoons at the IIUM mosque . We all sat on the marble floor in a circle , which is why the groups are named halaqah groups because halaqah is the Arabic word for circle . The students were to read and memorize a short section of the Qur'an each week . After students took turns reciting a few verses each , one student who was assigned the task the previous week would present a basic translation from Arabic to English n15 and an overview of the verses followed by an interpretation of the text usually drawing upon an authoritative source . This would be followed by a general discussion with individuals free to pose questions or offer comments on the text , the interpretive presentation , or any related matter . <p> Other students join the Malaysian Muslim Youth League ( ABIM ) . Founded by Anwar Ibrahim in 1971 as a student , ABIM organized around the issue of Malay language rights before transforming into an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom of religion at its core . ABIM is not directly linked with the Islamization of knowledge debate though the ABIM chapter at IIUM was forming an IOK Circle discussion group. ( n16 ) <p> There was also a general IOK Circle group that met about twice a month in the evening in an IIUM classroom in addition to the ABIM affiliated IOK Circle discussion group . Two undergraduate students including the son of a Pakistani diplomat and the nephew of a leading figure at the IIIT organized the IOK Circle meetings . Each meeting features one or more invited speakers who present a lecture on a topic related to the Islamization of knowledge or a commentary on a book ( often by the author ) central to the Islamization of knowledge . Approximately 20 students and faculty attended each of the IOK Circles I was present at with students representing the vast majority of attendees . <p> At one of the meetings , I was invited to give a commentary on the IIUM Rector AbdulHamid AbuSulayman 's ( 1993 ) book Crisis in the Muslim Mind . I was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trip out of the country. n17 I was fairly critical of the book in my presentation . I began with a basic summary of AbuSulayman 's main argument that Islamic civilization is in a state of crisis , the crisis is a crisis of thought , and he recommends an action plan to reunify knowledge and spread this knowledge throughout society . Then , I read the following quote outlining AbuSulayman 's criteria for evaluating knowledge and scholarship more generally : <p> The kind of knowledge to be sought and used ... is that which is sound in its principles , aims , and structure . Knowledge without these characteristics will be worthless when measured against the standards of Islamic teachings and principles . Any structure of Muslim knowledge that does not provide the Muslim mind with the means to achieve the best possible understanding and performance is not a true Islamic structure or methodology for thought , knowledge , or life . ( AbuSulayman 1993:99 ) <p> I then used AbuSulayman 's own criteria to critique the book . I did not critique the aims of the book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I did argue forcefully that in terms of principles and structure the book failed to meet the standards of either Western or Islamic scholarship. ( n18 ) <p> Louay Safi then gave a second commentary on the book. n19 Safi 's presentation took a different approach to my own . Safi argued that AbuSulayman 's book ought to be viewed as " intellectual activism " rather than as scholarship in a strict sense . He then outlined several points where he agreed or disagreed with AbuSulayman . <p> A question and answer session followed Safi 's presentation . The audience reaction was quite spirited as some individuals defended AbuSulayman and others agreed with at least some of the critiques Safi and I made . The importance of recounting this episode is that it highlights the strong feelings of attachment that many students have to both AbuSulayman and this book and to Islam in general . The students who attended the IOK Circle meetings were already interested in the Islamization of knowledge and for many of them it was specifically because of AbuSulayman 's Crisis in the Muslim Mind . Crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IIUM and most students encounter it more than once . And , for a few at least , Crisis in the Muslim Mind has transformed their way of thinking about the Islamic heritage . For example , one student before reading works published by IIIT , including AbuSulayman 's Crisis in the Muslim Mind , advocated a Salafi interpretation of Islam and wore a long beard . After reading the works of the IIIT , he is clean-shaven and is willing to critically examine the Islamic heritage including Salafi interpretations ( Personal communication ) . <p> A second theme in the question and answer session was whether I could legitimately criticize AbuSulayman 's book . Related to this theme were the issues of my familiarity with the Islamization of knowledge and also whether I had read Crisis in the Muslim Mind in its original Arabic or the English translation of the original. n20 I deflected both issues successfully and had some support doing this from a few individuals in the audience . The underlying question was the question of authenticity as it relates to authority . <p> The question of authenticity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the place of Islam and on who has the authority to represent Islam . In a separate interview , Safi discussed the question of authenticity . Safi argued that all scholarship depends upon a particular worldview and is thus not value free : " there is no escape from metaphysical understanding ... . you can not say that people can do research without having any metaphysical commitments or any ontological understanding . " Thus , religion is central to research because religion " gives answers to the most basic and profound questions about life -- who we are , where we come from , where we are heading , what is the purpose of what we see around us . " Therefore , those researchers who hold an Islamic understanding of the universe must relate their scholarship to their metaphysical beliefs " or otherwise something will be missing there . You can never be authentic if you ignore those fundamental things that influence your outlook in life . " When I then suggested that this leads logically to the point that Westerners could not do Islamic social science , Safi agreed partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholarship but not advance it . He stated , " You can critique something you do n't believe in , something you do n't agree with , but you ca n't bring it to heart . So , definitely , Western scholars can be authentic only if they were true to their own experiences and consciousness . " <p> The question of authenticity also is relevant for Muslims working in the Western tradition . According to Safi , the result of Muslim individuals working within the Western tradition is inauthentic scholarship that mimics others . This also relates back to AbuSulayman 's view , and that of IIIT , that there is a crisis of thought originating in the separation of Islamic and modern sciences . In an interview , AbuSulayman told me that the reason education needs to be reformed in the Muslim world is because there is no church in Islam . Therefore , in contrast to Christianity where there is both a church and a state , the only sources for the enculturation of Islamic values are education and the family . Without an institutionalized church to enculturate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly why he wrote Crisis in the Muslim Mind ( Personal communication ) . <p> AbuSulayman , contrary to my commentary on the book , felt that Crisis in the Muslim Mind is scholarly , systematic , and comprehensive . He did say , however , that the book was based more upon reflection than research . AbuSulayman noted the difference in tone between his book , which is highly critical of the Islamic heritage , and the work of Al-Faruqi , which is generally positive toward the Islamic heritage . AbuSulayman said this difference relates to the context in which each was writing and the intended audiences . AbuSulayman was writing in Arabic for Muslims from within the Muslim world while Al-Faruqi was living in the West and writing for a Western audience ( Personal communication ) . These differences in location and audience are also critical for understanding the episode of the closing of the Malaysian branch office of IIIT that was housed at IIUM and led by Louay Safi . <p> While I was in the midst of my Malaysian fieldwork , the IIITM ( IIIT Malaysia ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years had passed since the IIIT had seriously considered moving its headquarters to Malaysia , this was a big surprise both to me and to students who participated in the IOK Circle discussion groups and the rumors were flying . The main thrust of all the rumors was that IIITM was closed because of its close ties to Anwar Ibrahim -- Anwar invited IIIT personnel to work at IIUM and open a branch office , sits on the Board of Directors for IIIT affiliated organizations , and IIIT related individuals like Dr. Taha Al-Alwani spoke out publicly in defense of Anwar . There were even rumors that all of IIUM would be closed due to the loyalty of IIUM students to Anwar . <p> The rumors concerning the closing of IIITM being related to the Anwar crisis certainly seemed plausible since no one I had spoken to before the news broke had mentioned there was even a possibility of IIITM closing and the students I spoke to had no foreknowledge either . However , according to four different individuals who were present at the meeting who I asked repeatedly over a two year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fully adopted the same goals as the IIIT and therefore IIUM no longer needed the guidance and consultation of IIIT . While in the end , the closing of IIITM apparently was unrelated to the Anwar situation , the students ' reading of the episode highlights the discursive entanglements present when closely examined within particular sites . <p> The second strand of IOK at IIUM is that of Syed Muhammad Naquib Al-Attas and several colleagues at ISTAC . Al-Attas first discussed the idea for ISTAC with Anwar Ibrahim , a former student of Al-Attas and then Minister of Education , in 1986 , and ISTAC was formally established in 1987 with Al-Attas as Founder-Director ( Mohd Nor Wan Daud 1991 ) . ( n21 ) <p> The administration of ISTAC has a particular institutional vision derived from the thought and research of Al-Attas himself . Wan , who has written extensively on ISTAC , told me that ISTAC " is not just a center of learning ... . It is a center of learning developed by a philosopher and a scholar and based on a very strong philosophical understanding " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orig. 1978 ) defines Islamization as : <p> The liberation of man first from magical , mythological , animistic , national-cultural tradition , and then from secular control over his reason and his language . The man of Islam is he whose reason and language are no longer controlled by magic , mythology , animism , his own national and cultural traditions and secularism . He is liberated from both the magical and the secular world views ... . It is also liberation from subservience to his physical demands which inclines toward the secular and injustice to his true self or soul , for man as physical being inclines towards forgetfulness of his true nature , becoming ignorant of his true purpose and unjust to it . Islamization is a process not so much of evolution as that of devolution to original nature ... . His ' evolution ' towards perfection is his progress towards realization of his original nature as spirit . This in the individual , personal , existential sense Islamization refers to what is described above in which the Holy Prophet represents the highest and most perfect Example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refers to the Community 's striving towards realization of the moral and ethical quality of social perfection achieved during the age of the Holy Prophet ( may God bless and give him Peace ! ) who created it under Divine Guidance . <p> The basic idea is that reality consists of differences created by Allah . Allah also created what might be called a natural order but in reality is a supernatural or divine order . For Al-Attas and his colleagues , when the world is organized based upon this divine order this constitutes justice and the result is justice , harmony , and peace . And the knowledge and discipline of that order is adab . As Professor Wan explained , adab " is a key element in our identity . Adab is the discipline of the mind -- always wanting to put things in their right places " ( Personal communication ) . In summary , for Al-Attas and his colleagues , Islamization is the application of adab . <p> Al-Attas intends to realize his definition of Islamization in practice through ISTAC . As Al-Attas told me , he " tries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and ISTAC is one such reality . Al-Attas was deeply involved in creating ISTAC . Al-Attas made every important decision himself from the physical location where ISTAC was built to the architectural design and even the furnishings and the landscaping. ( n22 ) <p> The linkage between metaphysics and the everyday lived world is important for understanding Al-Attas . For Al-Attas and his colleagues , Islam is experienced in daily life if one lives according to the correct adab . Professor Wan , for example , almost always explained abstract concepts like " Islamization , " " adab , " and " justice " by grounding them in terms of everyday interpersonal relationships between husband and wife , between parents and children , between siblings , often using his family and friends as examples . Al-Attas and his colleagues argue that not only did Muslims live this way in the time of the Prophet Muhammad but that many Muslims continue to live their lives this way right now . The goal is to have all Muslims live according to the correct adab . <p> L : Conclusion The conceptualization of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways in which modernity unfolds across time and space . Gaonkar ( 2001 ) notes how even within the Western tradition the term modern has been differently conceptualized across time . In one conceptualization , the old instructs the new . The old is the standard by which each age measures excellence and " must seek to emulate under altered conditions without ever hoping to surpass it " ( Gaonkar 2001:6 ) . Anwar Ibrahim and many of the opposition figures and groups I discuss would take a similar stance . In the second conceptualization , the modern is associated with progress in knowledge and material well-being and is better than the past . This perspective is represented by Mahathir and Vision 2020 . In the third conceptualization ( post Baudelaire ) , modernity is associated with the present . Novelty and the present are valorized and the modern neither looks to the past for models or a standard nor claims the authority to " instruct the future " ( Gaonkar 2001:6 ) . This again is the conceptualization that nearly all parties in Malaysia fear . Drawing on Foucault , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these conceptualizations of modernity is " an attitude of questioning the present . " <p> I use " modernity " in a comparative sense and as a cultural space structured by the logic of capitalism in which Muslims are making and re-making modernity -- Malaysian , Malay , Islamic . Donham captures well what I have in mind when he describes modernity as a discursive space or public sphere in which " an argument takes place " and " at least some actors invoke notions of the modern in claims to power " and where " ideas of tradition are constructed and reconstructed " ( Donham 2002:244-245 , emphasis in original ) . ( n23 ) <p> While some scholars have questioned the utility of modernity as a theoretical construct given its empirical variability and use in practice , I agree with Knauft ( 2002 ) and Gaonkar ( 2001 ) that the idea of alternative modernities is theoretically productive . The Malaysian politicians and Muslim intellectuals engaged in the Islamization of knowledge debate are critically engaging with notions of modernity both in a comparative manner and are actively and creatively making and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The rise of identity-based groups within states , whether they are based on religion , ethnicity , gender , or race , at one time thought to contradict the homogenizing aspects of globalization must now be viewed as an outcome of globalization . Specifically , as state hegemony declines , the ability of the state to create citizen-based identities declines . As Friedman ( 2003:7 ) states : <p> If the modernist nation-state is based on the identification of a subject population with a national project that defines its members , in principle , in terms of equality and political representivity , and which is future oriented and developmentalistic , when this project loses its power of attraction , its subjects must look elsewhere ... . This leads to a range of cultural identifications that fragment and ethnify the former political units , from ethnic to religious to sexual , all in the vacuum left by a vanishing future . <p> This , in turn , creates the conditions under which alternative modernities can emerge and prosper . <p> Malaysian modernity embodied in Vision 2020 and its plans to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Malay and Malaysian identity . In Malaysia , " official " Islam is entrenched in the national development agenda . The Islamization of knowledge is thus interpreted within this context as an avenue to advance the Malaysian economy . At IIUM , the Islamization of knowledge , while officially advocated , is often subordinated to rhetoric more in line with the Malaysian economic development agenda . If the IIIT approach to the Islamization of knowledge appears on the surface compatible with the Malaysian modernity embodied in Vision 2020 , the approach of Al-Attas is problematic in that it foregrounds the spiritual goals of Islam while explicitly subordinating the " physical demands " of the secular world . Despite these apparent differences , both versions of the Islamization of knowledge have failed to transform IIUM or engage large audiences of Malaysians beyond the academic world . If at the IIUM , the IIIT version has failed due in some part to the subordination of the goals of IIUM to the national development plan Vision 2020 and Al-Attas ' version has failed to succeed as well , these and other Islamic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Centre for Public Policy Studies in Malaysia reports in a recent survey that 90 percent of respondents were proud to be Malaysian ; however , only 45 percent of Malaysians considered themselves Malaysian first while 42 percent viewed themselves as members of their ethnic group first . Twelve percent considered themselves as equally Malaysian and a member of their ethnic group . Among Muslims , given a choice between being Malay , Muslim , or Malaysian as their primary identity , 72.7 percent chose being Muslim ( Centre for Public Policy Studies 2006 ) . <p> Ultimately , the question remains whether or not the Malaysian government 's top-down social engineering project or any of the other alternatives will succeed at unifying Malaysia . By utilizing a discourse about modernity , Islam , and technoscience that is value-rich rather than value-free , this debate raises anew the questions " Whose modernity ? Whose values ?

I would like to thank the National Science Foundation and the Graduate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my research on Islam , science , and modernity . And , especially , I would like to thank everyone I met and worked with in Malaysia . <p> L : Footnotes n1 Malaysia is a multi-ethnic , multi-lingual , and religiously plural state in Southeast Asia located partly on the same peninsula as its northern neighbor , Thailand , and partly on the northern half of Borneo that it shares with Indonesia and Brunei . Of the approximately 27 million Malaysians , 53 percent are ethnically Malays , 26 percent are Chinese , 8 percent are Indian , 12 percent are non-Malay bumiputras , and other ethnicities comprise the final 1 percent . In terms of religious affiliation , 60.4 percent are Muslim , 19.2 percent are Buddhist , 9.1 percent are Christian , 6.3 percent are Hindu , 2.6 percent practice traditional Chinese religion , and 2.4 percent either practice another religion or no religion ( Lockwood 2003 ) . <p> I refer to the ex-Prime Minister Mahathir throughout this article because he was the primary mover behind Vision 2020 and was in power during my fieldwork in Malaysia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mahathir agenda . <p> n2 Article 160 of the Malaysian Constitution defines " Malay " as " a person who professes the religion of Islam , habitually speaks the Malay language , conforms to Malay custom " and was either born or resided in Malaysia or Singapore before or on Merdeka Day ( Malaysia 's Independence Day ) or the issue of such a person . <p> n3 In the wake of the Asian financial crisis that began in 1997 , Malaysia pegged the exchange rate of its national currency the ringgit at RM3.80 to $1 . The peg remained in place until Prime Minister Badawi refloated the exchange rate within hours of China 's decision to do the same . <p> n4 For example see the websites for the Petronas Towers and KL Tower where the Islamically-inspired architecture is discussed . **44;913;TOOLONG pettweb.nsf/frmhomehi ?

For a brief description see Nuttall ( 1998 ) . <p> n6 The IIIT is a think tank with headquarters in Herndon , Virginia , and branch offices in numerous Muslim and Western nations that advocates the Islamization of knowledge , the integration of Islamic values with modern knowledge , as a solution to the problems within the Muslim world . <p> n7 Anwar Ibrahim has a long affiliation with the IIIT and IIIT offshoot , Graduate School of Islamic and Social Sciences ( GSISS ) . He is a longtime member of the Board of Trustees for both IIIT and GSISS and was ( and may still be ) Chairman of the Board of Trustees at GSISS when I was there in 1997 . <p> n8 ISTAC has since 2002 lost its independent status and is incorporated into IIUM as a Kulliyyah . <p> n9 Crisis in the Muslim Mind is even assigned as required reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting to note that Berkouk , though a practicing Muslim , became involved with IIIT and then IIUM despite having had only three days of formal religious training at a Qur'anic school when he was four years old ( Personal communication ) . <p> n11 The information and the quote are from an internal document detailing the diploma program put together by the Department of General Studies at IIUM in the author 's possession . <p> n12 Comprehensive relational studies included sections on computers and scientific analysis , innovative thinking , economics in the age of globalization , and legal thinking . <p> n13 The information and the quote are from an internal document detailing the diploma program put together by the Department of General Studies at IIUM in the author 's possession . <p> n14 Interestingly , the idea behind the diploma programs harkens back to early ideas proposed by the IIIT . Specifically , the IIIT argued for the training of individuals with integrated perspectives combining both Islamic and modern knowledge who could then instruct future generations of students in a similar manner . <p> n15 The students came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had some Arabic language training the relative abilities were highly variable . Thus , the language of choice was English which is the language of instruction at IIUM and therefore common to all students . <p> n16 ABIM did have some interaction with the MSA in the United States , however , at least during its formative period ( Al-Attas , personal communication ) . Due to the political circumstances in Malaysia during the fall of 1998 with the ousting , arrest , and trial of Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and the subsequent Reformasi movement , I was not able to interview a large number of Malaysian students including representatives of ABIM . Even some Malaysian faculty members were hesitant to speak in any detail about anything related to Anwar including his links to the Islamization of knowledge debate and participants in the debate and his support of Islamization at IIUM that seemed completely separate from the political situation . In addition , I would like to note that my fieldwork in Malaysia was delayed a month and then shortened due to the political situation and Anwar 's close ties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to study . For example , Munawar Anees , a biologist and participant in the Islamization of knowledge debates from an Ijmali perspective and also a speechwriter for Anwar , was among the individuals arrested for allegedly allowing himself to be sodomized by Anwar . I had arranged to rent Anees ' spare bedroom while in Malaysia which was one reason for the delayed departure . The second reason was an email from a Malaysian professor I had met previously who recommended delaying my plans indefinitely because , as an American , I would likely be viewed as a CIA agent . <p> n17 I had heard mixed reviews about the book , and I only hesitantly agreed because I was unsure how my comments might affect my ongoing research . At the same time , I decided that the most interesting data is often gathered by full participation . The IOK Circle meeting occurred at IIUM on the evening of November 6 , 1998 . <p> n18 Without going into all the details of my critique , I noted four main structural faults and two main faults in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I argued that ( 1 ) the text is not logically ordered , ( 2 ) the text is quite repetitive and significant portions of the text are either tangential to the main arguments or are ignored when AbuSulayman summarizes his arguments and proposes his action plan , ( 3 ) AbuSulayman seems to make several contradictory statements on several key issues at different palces in the text , and ( 4 ) there are logical flaws in AbuSulayman 's argument . In terms of faults in terms of the principles of scholarship , I argued that ( 1 ) AbuSulayman presents no evidence to support his assertions and ( 2 ) many of the assertions are problematic . <p> n19 Louay Safi , a political scientist born in Syria but now an American citizen , is a second example of someone connected to IIIT being brought in to IIUM . Safi participated regularly in the Association of Muslim Social Scientists conferences as a graduate student at Wayne State University in Detroit . Through AMSS , Safi had met many individuals from the IIIT and IIUM . After completing his PhD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistant professor of political science at IIUM , which he accepted . After teaching for two years , Safi joined the staff of IIIT 's Malaysian office ( IIITM ) as Deputy Director when it opened in 1994 . Safi quickly rose through the ranks at IIITM and IIUM becoming Executive Director of IIITM in 1996 and Dean of the Research Center at IIUM in 1998 . <p> n20 Some individuals present were familiar with my research on the Islamization of knowledge debate and they supported my credibility on the subject in general . In terms of language , I noted that I read the English translation partly because I was asked only three days earlier and also because I knew the translator quite well and he had told me that the Arabic version , if anything , had more examples of the faults I had described in my presentation . In this , I also had some support from individuals present who had read the Arabic version or both versions . <p> n21 Al-Attas was born in Indonesia in 1931 . Of Hadramaut descent , he spent his childhood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malaysia . After completing secondary school , Al-Attas joined the Malay Regiment and was selected for advanced military education at Eton Hall and then the Royal Military Academy in Sandhurst , England . He saw active duty fighting against the communists in Malaya . He resigned his commission to pursue his education at the University of Malaya in Singapore . He went on for his MA degree at McGill University in Montreal and his PhD at the University of London . Al-Attas returned to the University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur . He was among the founders of the National University of Malaysia , the founder of the Institute of Malay Language , Literature , and Culture at the National University , and he is the founder-director of ISTAC . This brief summary is based upon the introductory remarks given by Professor Wan at the conferment of the Al-Ghazali Chair to Al-Attas at ISTAC ( Mohd Nor Wan Daud 1994 ) . <p> n22 For an extended discussion of the history and philosophy of ISTAC see Wan ( 1991 ) . <p> n23 See also Lukens-Bull ( 2005 ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Muslim Mind .
