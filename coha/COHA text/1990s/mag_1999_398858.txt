Section : THE Pastel PAGE <p> Sheldon Tapley was born in Maracaibo , Venezuela , in 1959 to British parents and was raised in Europe and the United States . After receiving his B.4. degree from Grinnell College in Grinnell , Iowa , the artist earned a M.F.A. degree in printmaking at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln . His work is in museum , corporate , and private collections across the country . In 1998 Tapley received an Al Smith Fellowship from the Kentucky Arts Council . He currently teaches painting and drawing at Centre College in Danville , Kentucky , and is represented by Tatistcheff Gallery in New York City . <p> Looking at a still-life pastel by Sheldon Tapley is like listening to a jazz trio play variations on Vivaldi . Although the notes may have been composed centuries ago , the feeling and interpretation of the music is entirely fresh and original . In a similar way , Tapley , who teaches painting and drawing at Centre College in Danville , Kentucky , and exhibits at Tatistcheff Gallery in New York City , masterfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision that is thoroughly modern and personal in his pastel still lifes . <p> Working in a demanding realist style , Tapley paints with all the authority and craftsmanship of such 17th-century Spanish still-life masters as Francisco de Zurbaran ( 1598-1664 ) and Juan Sanchez-Cotan ( 1561-1627 ) . In his exquisite pastel Contemplative Still Life , for instance , one can easily detect Tapley 's connection with the work of Sanchez-Cotan , a Carthusian monk who was himself an artist famous for the spare , almost monastic restraint of his still-life compositions . Tapley picks up on Sanchez-Cotan 's ascetic mood and applies it to his own work , but this is where his homage to the past ends and his originality begins . Dazzling the viewer with the beauty and virtuosity of his illusionistic technique , he not only employs trompe l'oeil , but pushes the illusions even further by delivering a small self-portrait as a distorted reflection in the blue vase , much like the style of the Italian Mannerist Parmigianino ( 1503-1540 ) . <p> All of Tapley 's work is marked by a unique poetic quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But although still life is an art form that easily lends itself to allegory and symbolism , Tapley is quick to point out that a literal or symbolic reading of his painting is misleading . " Reason can dry out a picture , " he contends . " If you 're not careful , allegory can become too mechanistic and lead to message making . And if the viewer can read the message , who needs the painting ? " <p> Tapley relies instead on his intuition when selecting the imagery for his paintings . His choice of objects , while not necessarily random , is based either on what he finds aesthetically pleasing or what happens to be available in his studio , which is an abandoned high school classroom on the Centre College campus . Occasionally the school 's theater department , located nearby , gives him discarded props and tables that he recycles into his still lifes . <p> Once he has decided to include a particular item , such as the Matisse print in Vessel , which he added simply because he was fond of the painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because the nudes in the Matisse print are feeding a turtle , Tapley added an empty turtle shell he had recently found on a neighbor 's lawn . The turtle shell , in turn , led to an affinity with the shape of the orange jug newly purchased by his wife from the local flea market . <p> Like many artists who have mastered their craft , Tapley , a former printmaker , has returned to a fundamentally simple approach to pastel painting . First of all , because he works directly from setups in his studio , he spends a great deal of time arranging and rearranging his arsenal of objects . Art reproductions , workman 's tools , flea market vases , and a never-ending supply of fresh-cut flowers from the family garden often find a place in his work . <p> When he does decide to do preliminary drawings or sketches , he keeps this early material near his easel for reference throughout the painting process . But more often , he creates his composition simply by arranging and rearranging the actual objects and rendering an occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper , a heavy sheet with internal sizing that can handle all the rubbing , scraping , and drawing that comes in the natural course of a pastel painting . But before he turns to pastel , Tapley works up the picture entirely in vine charcoal , which affords rapid alterations as it can be easily erased . <p> After he is satisfied with the charcoal drawing , he blows as much excess charcoal off the paper as possible , leaving just the barest ghost of the image . This trace of an image then serves as a guide for his pastel work . Using only Schmincke pastels , which he prefers for their softness , size , and color variety , he builds up his initial layers with a lot of blending , mostly with his fingers and the palm of his hand . The artist employs all sides of the pastel stick to make his marks : He uses the tips for most of his strokes and the sides for the larger areas . For fine details , he finds that the little knifelike edges of freshly broken crayons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make corrections in the pastel work , he uses a straight-edge razor to scrape the color off , usually down to the very surface of the paper itself . For very small areas , he breaks off the ends of razor blades to make tiny scrapers . <p> Once satisfied with the composition , the colors , the degree of illusion , and the textural surfaces , he considers the work finished . Only then does he fix his pastel painting with several light coats of Blair pastel fixative . Tapley 's images extend to the very edge of the sheet of paper and are framed so that the deckled torn paper edges are visible . <p> Tapley is an artist who has fully realized his artistic roots and is now working at the peak of his craft . His paintings display a technical virtuosity as well as an intellectual acuteness , and his true talent rests in combining these two qualities into a personal art that leaves us with a strong humanistic impact . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Sheldon Tapley <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Harlequin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection . <p> Vessel , 1998 , pastel , 15 x 16 .
