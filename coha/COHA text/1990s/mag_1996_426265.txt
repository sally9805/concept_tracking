Heavy traffic on the Web is changing its very nature . An industry analyst explains what the Internet bottleneck means to business . // The third week of March is no time for an avid basketball fan to find himself stuck in London . While the Brits were busy celebrating their rugby team 's capture of something called the Five Nations Championship , I desperately needed a fix of the drama and excitement of the big dance-the NCAA college hoop championships . So I ventured out into the streets in search of public Internet access . Luckily , I happened upon the Spider Cafe , complete with five donated Silicon Graphics terminals and two appropriately configured PCs . Two pounds , seventy-five pence per half-hour of access seemed a more than reasonable price to pay to placate my need for scores from the colonies . So I sat down , ordered an espresso , and logged into ESPN 's Website , ESPNet SportsZone ( http : //espnet.sportszone.com ) . What happened next was a seminal event with regard to my perception of the Internet and its future . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tech support person ( who doubles as a waitress ) , I was taken aback by her excuse . " It 's already 5 P.M. , and the States are online now . That always slows things down . " This one comment amplified a theory-no , a fear-that I have had for quite some time : The vision of the Internet as a shared , everyone's-equal network is nothing more than an academiabased , egalitarian dream that is inherently unsustainable . PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS on the Internet appear to be increasing . The December 1995 issue of an Internet newsletter called the Cook Report ( http : //pobox.com/cook ) noted that " with new users continuing to clamber aboard the Internet in record numbers , questions arise about the capacity of the infrastructure to sustain the growth . " In early February , David Garrison , CEO of Netcom , a leading Internet access provider , sent an Email to customers that began , " The Internet is experiencing growing pains . " More recently , USA Today published an article focusing on the way commercial traffic is hampering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result of exponential growth in the number of users , and the increase in the number of video and audio files being downloaded from the Web . These large multimedia files take up more than their fair share of Internet bandwidth , potentially displacing higher priority types of data , such as corporate E-mails . It would appear that the answer to these problems is simple : more bandwidth . But bandwidth comes at a cost . The Baby Bells seem more likely to protect their dividends than to jump-start expensive projects such as driving fiber optic cable deeper into neighborhoods around the country . At least one Internet service providerUUNet-has recently shelved an equity offering that would have given it capital to increase capacity at a time when competitors like AT &T; and MCI are butting into its business . What 's more , added capacity would not by itself guarantee that performance would improve . Just as software programs expand to take advantage of each advance in microprocessor technology , so too will media types expand to fill the available capacity on the Internet . One solution to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applications : E-mail , for example , would have the " right of way " over big video files . This allocation process , known as bandwidth prioritization , is also essential for applications that ca n't tolerate delays , such as video telephony or live audio and video feeds from a rock concert . UNFORTUNATELY , bandwidth allocation is difficult to implement . The Internet 's communication standard , called TCP/IP , is a simple , elegant technology that allows people running Macs , PCs , and workstations to share data on a network . Every transmission gets broken into standard-size packets-like little envelopes of data . Each packet carries an address but no information about what is inside . Without such information , there 's no way to identify the high-priority messages . Photograph First Boston analyst Gurley : The dream of one Internet for all is unsustainable. // What compounds the problem is that the network traversed by Internet messages is different from the one that delivers your phone calls . When you make a call from New York to San Francisco , the telephone system opens up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Internet 's network , the packets that constitute your message do n't all travel by the same route-some may go via Detroit , others via Dallas , Kansas City , or Pittsburgh-to then be reassembled in the right order at their destination . Guaranteeing bandwidth on such a dispersed network is extremely difficult . There are ambitious proposals to change the nature of the network or extend the TCP/IP protocol so that the address can include information about packet content . But these proposals are technologically complex and would require coordination between operators of adjacent networks . Such cooperation has been the rule since the days when the Internet was primarily a network of universities and government agencies , but as commercial traffic increases , the larger entities on the Net , like AT &T; and MCI , may feel less inclined to work with smaller service providers . In an atmosphere of increased congestion and declining cooperation , the Internet is bound to change from the entity we currently enjoy . While it 's hard to see exactly how it will evolve , three key trends should emerge over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Perhaps the most important development will be the rise of networks that lie somewhere between the Internet and intranets ( internal corporate networks that use Web technology ) . In a middle-net , service is guaranteed and real-time applications are possible . This is analogous to when groups of settlers in the Wild West formed communities so that they could define values that everyone would be expected to uphold . In a controlled environment it is easier to create schools , churches , and businesses . The only difference in the electronic world is that communities are determined by network proximity rather than geographic location . The desirability of such middle-nets is one reason the online services are n't dead yet . AOL , for instance , offers its subscribers differentiated content and guaranteed performance within the confines of its network . But AOL also gives subscribers a simple link to the greater Internet beyond its borders . Another kind of proliferating middle-net is the so-called virtual private network , in which a company contracts with an Internet service provider to connect two far-flung sites . The provider uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sites travel only on its own portion of the Internet . That way it can guarantee delivery , because it can modify TCP/IP to suit its needs . The company is also connected to the public Internet , but the content on the middle-net is available only to employees and selected customers . AT &T; is putting itself in position to create a fascinating kind of middle-net . When it recently introduced its Internet access service , it offered discounted access to elementary and secondary schools . Imagine the market power that comes with controlling a middlenet consisting of the majority of schools in the U.S. Besides connecting them to the Internet , AT &T; could connect schools to one another over its proprietary lines . That could give it an iron-fisted hold over the education software market . COMMODITY CONTENT TAKES OFF . We 're accustomed to thinking of content as high-value-added stuff-multimedia , magazine spinoffs , video clips-that may fuel profits on the Web . But basic commodity content , like stock prices , news , weather , and sports scores , may be more important . Small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access to the Net , given the arrival of competitors like AT &T,; with its huge , readymade customer base . So some will become consumer-oriented middle-nets , providing basic content at extremely high speeds . AOL users , for instance , already get stock quotes within the service faster than they can off the Internet . This means that service providers will need to sign up Internet content providers as soon as possible . Netcom , for example , recently announced that it would provide subscribers with personalized news assembled from a variety of wire services by Individual Inc. of Burlington , Massachusetts . PRICING BY PRIORITY . Without bandwidth prioritization , the most effective way to control congestion is to limit demand . We may see this kind of solution soon . Service providers may need to rein in their unlimited-usage pricing , choosing instead to bill by the bit , charge by the hour , or assess surcharges on heavy users . To date , such fees have been resisted by the Netcoms of the world , which have been trying to capture as many customers as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of people going online , the time may be right for tiered pricing . Would consumers still flock to the Web if they were n't guaranteed low flat fees for unlimited usage ? MIDDLE-NETS and new pricing structures offer short-term solutions to the problem of limited bandwidth . But their adoption may delay long-term solutions . The Internet is unlikely to soon become the medium of choice for phone calls or real-time video in anything other than an experimental fashion . This should not be taken as a eulogy for the Internet . In spite of my experience at the Spider Cafe , I remain quite optimistic about the Internet 's future and importance as a global communications infrastructure . It 's just that that future may not be the utopia some people imagine .
