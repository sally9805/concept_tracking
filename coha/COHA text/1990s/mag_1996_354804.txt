" DID YOU ASK FOR your future . <P> You will be old , infirm and , inevitably at some point , near death . You may or may not be in physical distress , but in an age of crushing health-care costs , you will be a burden to your loved ones , to say nothing of society . And thanks to courts that back in 1996 legalized doctor-assisted suicide for the first time in American history , all around you thousands of your aging contemporaries will be taking their life . <P> You may want to live those last few remaining weeks or months . You may have no intention of shortening your life . But now the question that before 1996 rarely arose  --  and when it did arise , only in the most hushed and guilty tones  --  will be raised routinely : Others are letting go ; others are giving way ; should not you too ? <P> Of course , the judges who plumbed the depths of the Constitution to find the " right " to physician-assisted suicide  --  a right unfindable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightmare scenario . Psychological pressure on the elderly and infirm to take drugs to hasten death ? Why , " there should be none , " breezily decrees the Second Circuit Court of Appeals . <P> King Canute had a better grip on reality . This nightmare scenario is not a hypothesis ; it has been tested in Holland and proved a fact . Holland is the only jurisdiction in the Western world that heretofore permitted physician-assisted suicide . The practice is now widespread ( perhaps 2,000 to 3,000 cases a year ; the U.S. equivalent would be 40,000 to 60,000 ) and abused . Indeed , legalization has resulted in so much abuse  --  not just psychological pressure but a shocking number of cases of out-and-out involuntary euthanasia , inconvenient and defenseless patients simply put to death without their consent  --  that last year the Dutch government was forced to change its euthanasia laws . <P> Judge Roger Miner , writing for the Second Circuit , uncomprehendingly admits the reality of the nightmare : " It seems clear that some physicians in the Netherlands practice nonvoluntary euthanasia , although it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why would such things occur in the Netherlands ? Are the people there morally inferior to Americans ? Are the doctors somehow crueler and more uncaring ? <P> Of course not . The obvious reason is that doctors there were relieved of the constraint of the law . The absolute ethical norm established since the time of Hippocrates  --  that doctors must not kill  --  was removed in the name of compassion , and the inevitable happened . Good , ordinary doctors , in their zeal to be ever more compassionate in terminating useless and suffering life , began killing people who did not even ask for it . Once given power heretofore reserved to God , some exceeded their narrow mandate and acted like God . Surprise . <P> In America the great moral barrier protecting us from such monstrous God-doctoring is the one separating passive from active euthanasia . Pulling the plug for the dying is permitted . Prescribing death-dealing drugs to those who are quite self-sustaining is not . It is this distinction that the judges are intent on destroying .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
