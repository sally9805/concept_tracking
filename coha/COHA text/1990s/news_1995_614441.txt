<p> The gruesome photographs brought the trial back to reality . During eight days of laborious testimony , Dr. Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran , the Los Angeles County coroner , laid out the evidence of murder in the O.J. Simpson trial . <p> Lakshmanan 's testimony was a compelling example of the power that coroners , pathologists and medical examiners have in murder cases . But his testimony also picked the scab on a problem that has been festering in America 's criminal justice system . <p> Just how reliable is the testimony given by coroners and medical examiners " to a reasonable degree of medical certainty " ? <p> At the start of his testimony Lakshmanan promptly acknowledged autopsy errors by Dr. Irwin Golden , the deputy medical examiner . But , he hastily added , these mistakes were irrelevant to the final conclusions in the case . <p> Still , prosecutors announced , they would not call Golden as a witness . This prompted the defense to suggest that Golden 's mistakes so embarrassed the prosecution that they were hiding him . <p> It might be easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical evidence , overwhelmingly , is so solid that coroners and medical examiners really do deserve the immense deference their testimony generally gets at trial . <p> But interviews with more than three dozen coroners , medical examiners , forensic pathologists , legal experts and people who have been victimized by the system paint a disturbing picture of a process that is , at best , woefully inadequate ; at worst , often inept . <p> " We 're still living in the dark ages " when it comes to death investigations , says Dr. Michael Baden . " It 's a national disgrace . " <p> Baden , director of the New York state police 's forensic sciences unit , has been retained by the Simpson defense team as an expert witness . <p> Dr. Werner Spitz , the former chief medical examiner for Wayne County , Mich. , and a consulting forensic pathologist near Detroit , estimates that up to 70 percent of the country is poorly served by its system for investigating unnatural deaths . <p> " Is this an enlightened system ? " Spitz asks . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than what they have in many Third World countries . " <p> Of the nearly 2.2 million deaths reported in the United States in 1992 , almost 7 percent , or nearly 143,000 deaths , were classified as unnatural , according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ' Division of Vital Statistics . <p> The importance of a proper death investigation can not be overestimated , up to and including the possibility that it could lead to a criminal prosecution . <p> A death certificate can either compound a family 's grief or bring peace of mind . It is used to resolve a range of legal issues , from insurance coverage to death benefits to civil liability . <p> Among this country 's more than 3,000 individual jurisdictions , there is no uniform method for certifying deaths . No two states do it alike . Within some states the process varies from county to county . <p> Only a handful of states and large U.S. urban areas with medical- examiner systems require that death investigations be conducted by board- certified or board-eligible forensic pathologists - specialists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as those from gunshot , stabbing , poison or blunt force . <p> Only four states - Ohio , Kansas , North Dakota and Louisiana - require that a coroner be a doctor . In North Dakota the requirement applies only to counties with more than 8,000 people . And Louisiana makes an exception for parishes in which no doctor is willing to serve . <p> As a result a disproportionate number of coroners are actually funeral home directors who have fallen into their line of work because they happen to be in the business of transporting bodies . Sheriff 's deputies , school bus drivers and tow-truck operators also have served as coroners . So have gas station attendants , bar owners , jewelry salesmen and accountants . <p> Small wonder that every four years in one Kentucky county , the hardest-fought race is the one between the same two rival funeral home directors who want to be coroner . The winner 's funeral parlor gets all the coroner 's business . <p> And who would fault the logic of one tow-truck driver campaigning for county coroner in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to pick up the wrecks . I might as well get the bodies too . " <p> Many coroners operate on a shoestring budget , which forces them to cut corners whenever and wherever they can . Too many rely for autopsies on hospital pathologists , who are trained to study the ravages of disease , not to reconstruct how somebody died . <p> " Asking a hospital pathologist to do an autopsy on the victim of a violent death is like asking a dermatologist to perform brain surgery , " Baden says . <p> Medical examiner systems come with their own set of problems , not the least of which is the shortage of highly skilled personnel . <p> Of the nearly 671,000 doctors licensed to practice in the United States , fewe r than 3 percent , or 17,149 , are specialists in pathology , according to the American Medical Association . Only 435 are board- eligible forensic pathologists , of whom 335 are board-certified . Not all forensic pathologists work full time . At least 12 states do n't employ any at all . <p> One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the work , which can be both dirty and demanding . Medical examiners are on call 24 hours a day . Their caseloads are often crushing . Many of their offices are chronically understaffed and ill-equipped . They must spend a lot of time in court . A medical examiner 's relatively poor pay does n't help . <p> Nobody knows how many murders go undetected , how many killers go free , how many innocent people are convicted of a crime that never occurred or how many suicides are covered up in deference to the next of kin . <p> " It probably happens more often than we know of , or would like to think , " says Dr. Boyd Stephens , San Francisco 's chief medical examiner . " But if everything 's not done properly in the beginning , nobody 's usually ever going to know whether a mistake was made . " <p> In the Simpson case , Golden made numerous errors - more than 30 , according to his boss , Lakshmanan . They included mislabeling a container of body fluid , failing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserving the contents of Nicole Brown Simpson 's stomach , which could have provided clues about the exact time of her death . Golden also made mistakes in other autopsies . <p> In Memphis , Shelby County Medical Examiner Dr. Jerry Francisco has a history of controversial autopsy findings . In the 1977 death of singer Elvis Presley , Francisco announced that Presley died of heart disease , despite autopsy results that showed extensive prescription drug abuse . In another case , Francisco ruled that a black man who had been beaten by police died as a result of an " accident " when blood from head wounds collected in the man 's lungs , suffocating him . The police department used the ruling to exonerate the officers involved and return them to active duty . <p> Consider also the notorious case of Ralph Erdmann . The former medical examiner for more than 40 west Texas counties , Erdmann pleaded no contest in 1992 to charges of faking or botching hundreds of autopsies over a nine-year period . He was placed on 10 years ' probation , ordered to perform 200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical license . <p> Kenneth Reno knows all too well what can happen when something goes wrong with an autopsy . In 1991 the Detroit-area man spent nearly six months in jail awaiting trial for a double murder he did n't commit . <p> One night Reno was watching television with his 21-year-old daughter , Robin , when his dentures broke on a popcorn kernel . His wife , Carlynne , was in bed asleep . He went to the store to get some glue . He returned a half-hour later and found his wife dead and his daughter mortally wounded . <p> Each had been stabbed more than a dozen times . <p> When Reno asked his daughter who had stabbed her , he said she replied , " Tommy . . . Tom Collins . " <p> When he asked who Collins was , Reno said , Robin identified him as a friend of the father of her 2-year-old daughter . <p> Moments later Reno 's daughter died . <p> The next day Reno was charged with two counts of murder . He was prosecuted mainly on the strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cords had been cut , rendering her incapable of speaking . <p> Despite the autopsy report , Dan Less , the Wayne County assistant prosecutor , still had doubts about Reno 's guilt . It did n't make sense for Reno to make up the story because the whereabouts of the man he had accused could easily be checked out . <p> The autopsy report on Reno 's wife provided another clue that something was amiss . It said the woman had still-intact natural teeth , but Less knew the victim had false teeth , which had been knocked out during the attack . <p> So the prosecutor asked four outside experts , including a throat specialist , to review the autopsy report and Robin 's larynx , which had been preserved as evidence . All four concluded that Robin 's vocal cords had not been cut , making Reno 's story all the more credible . <p> Six months later Tom Collins , the man Robin had identified as her assailant , was arrested for a burglary . Eventually he confessed to the killings and was sentenced to life in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of safeguards put in place , " Reno said of the system of investigating deaths . " It might cost a little more money , but where there 's a life involved , it would be worth it . " <p> Yet , while the shortcomings of the system may be all too obvious , a solution is more elusive . <p> Some forensic pathologists suggest giving medical examiners civil- service status or allying them more closely with medical schools , which have a strong tradition of independence . <p> Some advocate setting up regional forensic science centers that offer continuing education and the services of an expert . Some propose creating a private system that operates on a fee-for-service basis . <p> But nearly all agree on some basic needs . These include : &gt; Higher salaries to lure more bright young doctors into the field . &gt; A uniform set of national standards to govern the profession . &gt; Better training for employees to minimize the potential for error . <p> &gt; Improved funding to ensure that each investigation gets the attention it deserves . <p> At the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly publicized testimony , this often overlooked area of the criminal justice system is likely to come under increased scrutiny . <p> Mark Hansen is a reporter and Gary Hengstler is editor of the ABA ( American Bar Association ) Journal , from which this article is adapted .
