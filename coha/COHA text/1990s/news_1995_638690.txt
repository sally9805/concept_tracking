<p> Any parent who 's tangled with a toddler over whether chocolate-frosted doughnuts will be on the morning menu knows that helping kids to make food choices is one of the toughest jobs around . <p> It does n't get any easier . School-agers are eager to " do it themselves " and be in control of their own diet ; adolescents are notorious for their bad eating habits . <p> And the experts do n't seem to be much help . In the face of newspaper headlines like " U.S. Kids Getting Fatter , " doctors and nutritionists are putting out books that argue over how much we should actually worry about chubby children . <p> One book by two Massachusetts pediatricians , " Let Them Eat Cake ! " ( Villard , $ 19.95 ) says exactly that : Parents should n't be controlling what kids eat , and if they want cake , or candy , or snacks four times a day , then we should n't obsess about that , as long as they 're healthy , with normal growth and development . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jay Gordon , who was on TV 's now-canceled " The Home Show " and is pediatrician to the stars ' kids . He lists cow 's milk , chicken , eggs , hamburger and fish as " dangerous foods ; " calls wieners " one of the scariest foods around ; " says kids should never ever be taken to a fast-food restaurant ; and likens allowing your child to have a piece of candy to letting him have a glass of bourbon . <p> " I view candy as a punishment , not a treat , " he writes in his rigid book " Good Food Today , Great Kids Tomorrow " ( Michael Wiese Productions , $ 17.95 ) . ( Gordon DOES approve of grain-based stir-fries , soy milk , and fruit compotes for dessert . ) <p> What most of the experts do seem to agree on is that kids are , indeed , putting on the pounds . A Tufts University School of Medicine study showed that obesity has increased 55 percent among children . Its author termed obesity in kids as " the disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Health Statistics followed up with a report this month that 4.7 million American youths ages 6-17 are " severely overweight . " <p> So what are parents supposed to do ? Maybe the adults are struggling with extra pounds themselves , or remember the cruel " Fatty , Fatty 2-by-4 " jokes that kids can hurl at one another . <p> A more middle-of-the road approach is advanced by Dr. Laura Nathanson , whose " Portable Pediatrician for Parents " book is a Bible for many parents , and who now weighs in on food issues . <p> " Kidshapes : A Guide to Helping Your Children Control Their Weight , " ( Harper Collins , $ 17.50 ) argues that you should indeed be concerned about tubby toddlers and fat 5-year-olds , but that kids can learn to make their own responsible , healthy food decisions about what and how much they eat . <p> Nathanson does advocate controlling the snack monster - snacks too often tend to be unhealthy , and they can trap kids into thinking they need to eat constantly - but unlike some kid-food zealots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give in occasionally to their children 's whims . <p> And she 's not happy with the nation 's pediatricians , who , she says , are sidestepping food and weight issues . <p> " Pediatricians tend to respond to parents ' concerns by just ducking the issue . ... In medical training , we do n't learn to deal with healthy kids , just sick ones . <p> " And they have this silly attitude that if you do n't tell a kid he 's overweight , if you do n't talk about it , the kid wo n't know . But kids do ! " she said . <p> One of the biggest keys to helping children learn to eat well is avoiding power struggles , said Nathanson . <p> " You try to make the situation control the behavior , rather than the parent controlling it , " she said . In other words , if your preschooler wants snacks and wants to choose her own , create her own cupboard drawer or bin in the refrigerator , and stock it with only good things . She learns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice , and Mom can be confident it 's a healthy choice . <p> The " Three Big Rules of Toddler Eating " as Nathanson sees them are : 1 ) the adult decides what variety of food to offer , 2 ) the toddler decides how much of each to eat , and 3 ) adults decide the maximum , but not the minimum , offered . <p> For example , Junior wants more macaroni and cheese , but you believe he 's had enough ? " Say ' That 's all there is for lunch . ' Stop there . Say no more . " <p> Nathanson goes easy on parents . <p> " We put pressure on parents to be perfect that 's unfortunate , " she said . <p> In her book , she adds , " If Finicky Eater refuses to eat a bite of anything else , remember , It 's not your fault ! Your duty was to present a plate of delicious , nutritious food . You did . Her job is to eat it . Merely say , ' Lunch is over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ' <p> One of Nathanson 's big issues is juice ; she hates it as a choice for babies and children and is even " very mad at juice , " she writes . It 's " highly overrated " as a beverage , and the proliferation of tiny boxes that kids tote around with them is a plague upon America , as she sees it . <p> " It causes children to think all beverages should be sweet , and that there 's something wrong with water , " she said . <p> Unlike the " Let Them Eat Cake " authors - of whom Nathanson is critical - she is very concerned when toddlers and preschoolers begin to show signs of chubbiness , because it may indicate a future problem . The 3-5 age group is the last time parents can be an intimate force in their kids ' lives ; later , friends , school , the media and the desire to separate kick in , " so this is a very special time ; make the most of it , " writes Nathanson . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These fat cells do n't go away ; they are there for life , " she writes . <p> But being concerned does n't mean obsessing over extra pounds , or putting a 4-year-old on a diet . <p> " Children should never have to lose weight all they have to do is grow into it . It 's a matter of slowing down that gain , " she said . <p> That 's why acknowledging at an early age that a child may be prone to putting on extra weight is important . Parents can redouble efforts to teach about healthy choices and nutritional food , she said . <p> She advises parents to chuck the typical " Weight for Age , " which compare a child 's weight to others of his age , and instead plot a " Weight for Height " growth chart . That gives an idea if a child 's size is appropriate for his or her height , and is a better clue to where the child 's weight is going , said Nathanson . <p> Her other big concern is growing inactivity among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical education , she said . <p> " Kids are n't running around enough , " she said . Her book offers tips for ways to get kids off the couch and active . <p> " Kidshapes " : Advice by the Ages <p> BABIES : 1-4 months ( when " Roly-Poly is Hunky-Dory " ) <p> Even plump babies should n't lose weight or go hungry . Baby 's brain must be well-nourished . <p> Babies under 4 months rarely need solids . <p> Do n't start juice unless you " want your child to have tooth decay , and to refuse milk and water because they are n't sweet enough . " <p> INFANTS : 4-12 months <p> Very plump infants should n't lose weight , but only slow down rate of gain . <p> Babies this age already are forming food-related habits and attitudes . <p> Refrain from using food as reward , bribe , entertainment or punishment ; demand the same of caregivers . <p> Parents decide what gets offered and baby decides how is eaten . <p> TODDLERS : 1-3 years <p> Most toddlers need about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these should be from 16 ounces of whole milk daily . Easiest way to reduce fat calories for Twos and older is to cut fat in milk ; serve 1 percent or nonfat . <p> Statistically , little girls who gain too much weight are likely to start this at age 1-2 ; boys start it between 2-3 . <p> PRESCHOOLERS : 3-5 years <p> Most eat one good meal a day and " just pick " the rest of the day . <p> Given regularly-timed meals and nutritious snacks , most will eat the amounts they need , with parents offering help in regulating . <p> Food traps for this group include fat-rich meals and snacks such as cheese and cold cuts , juice as a beverage , too much milk , and constant munchies of crackers and cookies . <p> SCHOOL-AGERS : 5-Puberty <p> The top of kids is not to slim down , but to feel great about themselves .

These are present for life . <p> If a child is obese at 7 , the chance of being obese as an adult is 40 percent . If obese at 11 , the risk increases to 75 percent . <p> Main focus of parents must be on encouraging child to exercise aerobically for at least a half-hour a day , five days a week .
