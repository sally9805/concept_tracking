GETTING STARTED // The Greatest Misconception about Service Marketing // In a free-association test , most people  --  including most people in business  --  will equate the word " marketing " with selling and advertising : pushing the goods . // In this popular view , marketing means taking what you have and shoving it down buyers ' throats . " We need better marketing " invariably means " We need to get our name out "  --  with ads , publicity , and maybe some direct mail . // Unfortunately , this focus on getting the word outside distracts companies from the inside , and from the first rule of service marketing : The core of service marketing is the service itself . // I am not suggesting that if you build a better service , the world will beat a path to your door . Many " better services " are foundering because of rotten marketing . Nor am I suggesting that getting the word out is enough . Getting the word out and attracting people to a flawed service is the preferred strategy for killing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying : The first principle of service marketing is Guy Kawasaki 's first principle of computer marketing : // Get better reality . " Better reality " in your service will make marketing easier , cheaper , and more profitable . In fact , some companies have improved their " reality " so much they can almost eliminate the " getting the word out " part of their marketing plans . // The first step in service marketing is your service . // A World on Hold // For years we 've heard this is a cold , hard world . // What makes us think that ? // It 's not our family , friends , or neighbors ; we get this idea from dealing with services . // We get it from calling a public television station in New York , which puts us on hold for six minutes before it tells us  --  electronically  --  to call back ; all lines are busy . We get it from the credit card company that sends a replacement card three months late . We get it from the Minneapolis printer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't call until the following Monday ( my experiences in just the last three weeks ) . // Will Beckwith , age ten , says it perfectly : Too often , service sucks . // Service quality has sunk so low that if no one complains about your service , you should n't feel good . Most people have given up complaining . // Why has service gotten so bad ? // It is partly because companies can not show precisely that investing more in improving service  --  whether in training , salaries , or increased staffing  --  will earn them more . To improve their profits , companies squeeze costs by squeezing their service until someone  --  usually a client  --  screams . // Think of the times when you have received extraordinary service . How much more did you end up spending with that company ? How many people did you tell about your experience ? How much did they spend ? // No , you can not get a precise figure , but it is a huge figure . And it 's all in that company 's bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rent a list , dash off a press release  --  fix your service . // The Lake Wobegon Effect : Overestimating Yourself // " The Average American thinks he is n't , " someone once said . Psychologists have proved it . // We think we 're better than we are . // When researchers asked students to rate their ability to get along with others , 60 percent rated themselves in the top 10 percent . Ninety-four percent of university professors say they are doing a better job than their average colleague . Most men think they are good-looking . // Our illusions of superiority are so widespread that psychologists have come up with a name for it . They call it the Lake Wobegon Effect , after Garrison Keillor 's famous radio show sign-off from his fictional hometown , Lake Wobegon , " where the women are strong , the men are good-looking , and all of the children are above average . " // Being human , everyone in your company suffers from the Lake Wobegon effect , too . You think you are better than you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Service in this country is so bad that you can offer above average service and still stink . By definition , the odds are that you 're average . // Assume your service is bad . It ca n't hurt , and it will force you to improve . // Those Cartoons Are n't Funny // You 've seen the Quality , Service , Price , Pick One signs , and the You Want It When ? cartoons . ( Not surprisingly , it 's the worst services that are most likely to display these cartoons. ) // When I see these cartoons , which suggest that customers expect too much , I always tell the clerk , " I 'm going to talk to a couple other places before I decide . " // But I have decided . I 'm not coming back . // If you decide that you can not offer quality , speed , and price , you 're not trying hard enough . // How can McDonald 's deliver spotless rest rooms and world-class french fries in 50 seconds for 79 cents ? // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clients Set Your Standards // In many service businesses , the industry  --  not the client  --  defines quality . // Consider advertising , law , and architecture , for example . // In advertising , when most creative people say , " That 's a really good ad , " they do n't mean that the ad might build the client 's business . They just mean that it has a good headline , good visual  --  it 's good . Neat . Cool . // Lawyers think the same way . They 'll say , " That 's a really good brief . " Never mind that the brief was equally effective for the client $5,000 earlier . And never mind that the brief covers an issue that might have been avoided entirely through good lawyering. // Many architects treasure buildings that are enormously inconvenient for the people who work inside . Still , architects call them great buildings . Quality service produced them . // Ask : Who is setting your standards  --  your industry , your ego , or your clients ? // Bad News : You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee shop one morning , hopeful . // Four people are in line , but I decide I can bear that . // Unfortunately , nothing is in line behind the counter . A server hands Customer One a large decaf . The customer had asked for a small regular . The other server is flirting with Customer Two . It 's touching and nostalgic to me , but not entertaining enough to make me overlook the delay . // Four minutes later , I get my large latte. // Twenty years ago , I might have accepted that delay . Twenty years ago , I also accepted rest rooms carpeted with wet paper towels , waiters wearing catsup- stained aprons and chewing Bazooka bubble gum , and ten-day delivery from catalogs . // Then McDonald 's came along and raised everyone 's standards for rest rooms , better restaurants raised our expectations of waiters , and Federal Express raised our standards for catalog delivery . Those services changed our expectations forever . // Now we expect cleaner rest rooms , faster services , and more attentive waiters. // More people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disney World ; they know how clean , friendly , and creative service can be . // They have seen world-class service , and now every service has to accept it . Printers , for one wretched example , can not expect their customers to tolerate service that meets printing industry standards if those industry standards fall below customers ' expectations , which they routinely do . The printers ' customers have been to Disney World , and that experience has raised their expectations . // A service that does not jump to meet these rising expectations will have a small revolution and a customer exodus on its hands . // Ignore your industry 's benchmarks , and copy Disney 's . // The Butterfly Effect // In 1963 , meteorologist Edward Lorenz announced a stunning conclusion . // For decades , people had viewed the universe as a large machine in which causes matched effects . People presumed that big causes had big effects , and little causes produced little effects . Lorenz doubted this . // The question posed to Lorenz sounded strange but simple : Could the flap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in North Carolina ? // After considerable study , Lorenz answered yes . // Lorenz 's postulation of what is now called the Butterfly Effect was one of several findings in the last twenty years that reflect the unpredictability of everything : weather , the likely outcome of direct marketing programs , and the distant but often enormous effects of tiny causes . // One group of people was not surprised by Lorenz 's discovery , however . Those people had seen the Butterfly Effect at work every day . They were careful observers of service companies  --  a world where tiny efforts often produce enormous , though sometimes distant , effects . // Remember the Butterfly Effect . Tiny cause , huge effect . // A Butterfly Named Roger // On September 16 , 1993 , a Minneapolis man remembered that Dayton 's suit department had promised they would have his summer-weight jacket repaired and ready by that afternoon . // The executive approached the register and was quickly met by an energetic dark- haired clerk named Roger Azzam. // " I 'm here for the jacket , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alterations with bad news . " Sorry , not ready . " The executive had barely started to complain that his heart was set on getting the jacket when Roger disappeared , shouting , " Be right back ! " // Almost as quickly , Roger returned . " They will do it right now and have the jacket in five minutes , I promise , " he said . // The customer reacted as most people would . He was touched . Actually , he was more than touched . The clerk had gone so far out of his way that the customer now felt indebted to him . // While the customer waited , he started walking through three aisles of sports jackets . // He spotted a handsome brown herringbone Hugo Boss jacket with a matching price tag : $575. // Naturally , the story ends with the executive buying the $575 jacket  --  but not only that . He also had to buy a $110 pair of black slacks and a $55 brown , black , and white ? striped tie to match them . // In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Roger Azzam 's five-minute dash up to Alterations  --  created a $740 sale . Not to mention the value of all the publicity Dayton 's is getting here right now for Roger 's gesture . // The morning after that sale , the senior buyer in Dayton 's men 's suits department reviewed the sales figures on his computer screen . " I sold another of those Hugo Boss jackets , " he complimented himself , crediting his shrewd buying and understanding of his customers . But Dayton 's buyer did not sell the jacket . Roger Azzam did  --  with a gesture almost as tiny as the flap of a butterfly 's wings . // Be a Roger , and hire Rogers . Flap your wings .
