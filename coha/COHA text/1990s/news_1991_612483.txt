<p> Each week the Gwinnett Extra asks readers to respond to a question of public interest . <p> Do you still believe in Santa Claus ? Why or why not ? <p> Is Santa Claus for real ? A little girl named Virginia had her doubts , but not the mock Court of Historical Review and Appeals . <p> The just-for-fun court convened over lunch in 1989 and said you better believe Santa is real . <p> Still , disbelievers abound , despite the moving testimonies of films such as " Miracle on 34th Street " or , more recently , the animated television special about Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer . <p> Some people are fearful that Santa and other Christmas traditions may overwhelm the religious underpinnings of the holiday . <p> But others believe Santa brings out the good in everyone . <p> What do you think ? Is St. Nick still real in your heart ? ; Of course ! Jesus is proof . <p> Of course I believe in Santa Claus . Because Santa Claus is the act of giving and Jesus Christ was given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason for the season . <p> Personally , I do n't believe in Santa Claus because I do n't think he could fit in a fax machine to be faxed everywhere on Christmas Eve . <p> Yes , I believe in Santa Claus because he brings me presents . He 's just a jolly good fellow . He makes all the kids happy , makes old men like me happy , makes my wife happy . So I believe in Santa Claus . <p> I believe in the spirit of Christmas and the fact that we give and ought to give and look forward to giving more than receiving gifts . I think the joy of Christmas is first of all receiving the ultimate gift , God 's son , Jesus . When we know Jesus as our personal savior we are in a better position to understand the true significance of giving . <p> To me , Santa Claus represents giving . <p> The reason I do n't believe in Santa Claus is because I woke up one morning and my mom and my dad were sticking presents under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One night on Christmas I hung a note in the doorway in the hall and it had a little box on it and over the box it said , " If you are real , Santa , please check the box . " <p> Then I woke up the next morning and the box was checked and my parents were sleeping and they did n't do it . <p> In the sense that Santa represents the child in all of us , and that good feeling that we receive from giving and celebrating the true meaning of Christmas , yes . <p> No , I do n't . I believe in Christmas , though . I do n't believe he 's the real reason for Christmas . <p> The man needs a new tailor . He 's been wearing the same suit for years . At least he got rid of the bellbottoms . Maybe the stone-washed look . ... <p> Sure , I believe in Santa Claus . I love seeing the spirit of Christmas in little children . <p> Yes , I do . Why do I ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's like love . You ca n't see it but that does n't mean it 's not there . <p> Just because you ca n't see Santa come down the chimney does n't mean he does n't exist . He could even be a she . Ai n't no telling . Maybe the Mister stays at home . Maybe they alternate years . <p> Gerald Blaney , State Court solicitor ; Now that I 'm older , yes <p> Beauty P. Baldwin , Buford schools superintendent ; No , he ca n't fit in the fax <p> The Rev. Calvin Webb , Pastor , White Oak Baptist Church ; Santa Claus makes us happy <p> Charles Grady , Security guard ; Yes , Santa means giving <p> The Rev. Walter Gilbert Pastor , Zion Hill Baptist Church ; No , it 's mom and dad <p> Tommy McCullough , 8 Buford Elementary ; Yes , he answered my note <p> Eric Pfeifer , 7 Buford Elementary ; Santa is the child in all of us <p> George G. Thompson , Gwinnett school superintendent ; No , I do n't believe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he needs a tailor <p> Marc Head Bill Head Funeral Home ; I believe in Santa Claus <p> Bill Head Owner , Bill Head Funeral Home ; Yes , but Santa is a bit shy <p> The Rev. Frances West , Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Gwinnett ; Yes ! My stockings are up <p> Bill Baughman Gwinnett Extension Service ; He is the spirit of Christmas <p> Karen Haake Artist , Pinckneyville Arts Center ; It 's got ta be true , has n't it ? <p> Richard Garmon Garmon 's Auto Service ; I still believe in Santa Claus <p> Butch Conway Lawrenceville police chief ; He always leaves something <p> J. Curtis McGill , County commissioner ; Oh yes , absolutely I do . And the funny thing is I did not when I was a small child . I was born in the Depression , and I think children of the Depression tried to be realistic - and that meant not believing in things there were not real . <p> But the spirit that Santa Claus personifies - giving and joy and spontaneity and generosity - yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the world . ... It 's the giving when you do n't have to give that I think Santa Claus personifies . <p> Sure I believe in Santa Claus . We 've got 11 stockings hanging on our mantel . If I did n't believe somebody was going to fill them up , I would n't put them there . <p> I do . Because I believe he 's a spiritual representation of what Christmas is all about . I feel that way because instead of feeling materialistic about the holidays , people convey warmth to each other . And he is a symbol of warmth and generosity at Christmas and parallels the teachings of Jesus . <p> Sure I do . Why ? It 's always been a special time to me . I guess if you believe it 's just like believing in God . You 're believing in something you have n't seen before . It 's got ta be true , has n't it ? <p> Yes , I still believe in Santa Claus . Because of all good things that still happen and the goodness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always delivers me presents under my tree on Christmas Day . And if he 's not leaving them there , I do n't know who is . <p> Question <p> for next week : <p> What was the best thing about 1991 , and what do you expect in 1992 ? <p> To respond , please leave an answer on the Gwinnett Extra Newsline , 222-2049 or fax an answer to 263-3011 by 4 p.m .
