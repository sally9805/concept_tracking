<p> One day recently , Takashi Ozawa , a sixth-grader with a passion for soccer , arrived home in this bedroom community an hour from Tokyo with a question for his mother . What had she done when she had been a teacher , and a student forgot his book ? In the course of their talk , the issue behind the question came out . To discipline Takashi and four others who had forgotten their texts , their teacher called them to the front of the class and struck them . " I got very agitated , " remembers Kyoko Ozawa , who demanded and got apologies from the teacher and school principal . " I try to have a lot of communication with my kids . When Takashi told me about this , I said ' You do n't have to put yourself in a position where he can do that . ' " Japan 's Ministry of Education would probably approve of Mrs. Ozawa 's actions . Parents taking more responsibility for the behavior of their children , even challenging teachers , is central to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , truancy , and delinquency , the ministry is trying to teach adults a thing or two about parenting . A report called " Let 's Talk to Our Children " offers advice on everything from play time to family holidays ( see box below ) . But the report is controversial , helping to fuel a national discussion about the role of families today . <p> The price of economic success ? The report questions the fundamental tenets of modern Japanese society . It intimates that the current formula for economic success - men work long hours while women raise children , fitting-in taking precedence over challenging the norm , and study before play ( even to the exclusion of play ) - is fostering imbalances within the family . Absentee fathers , child-rearing with the sole focus on future careers , and abdication of parental responsibility to educational institutions are producing unprecedented social ills among youths here . The ministry 's report is subtitled " a crisis of confidence in raising the next generation , " a widely held sentiment . Newspaper articles ask , " What has happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a national high school speech contest argued that parents no longer fulfill their traditional roles . " The family is the most fundamental unit of the society where we all learn its basic rules and also how to love others , " said Tatekimi Matsuzaki of Kasukabe Kyoei High last month . He said mothers are n't providing proper love and fathers are n't teaching discipline . " When my father started coming home late , we could n't spend so much time together ... I began to turn into a spoiled brat ... My father was something like the foundation of morals and justice . So , when he began to be absent from the house , our house was like a society without any law enforcement . Thus , discipline taught by fathers is necessary for children to know the rules of the society we live in , and with that we learn how to get along with others . " Even the entertainment industry has chimed in . Takeshi Kitano , a popular creator of violent , nihilistic films , offered this advice in an article : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're free . Do what you want , ' " he wrote . " If we set limits and tell them how they have to go about things , they find out how to enjoy themselves within those limits . " In the last few years , Japanese kids have been testing limits as never before . Reports of teen violence , crime , and rising drug use have dominated the media , and a series of school killings have shocked the nation . While the numbers are tiny compared to the US , they have profoundly unsettled Japan , which has long thought of itself as a safe and stable country . In the hunt for the roots of this juvenile instability , the magnifying glass is now poised over parents . The Central Council for Education , meeting to discuss curriculum revisions last year , decided solutions lie , at least partially , at home . " We want to teach kids respect for life , independence , and integrity , " says Yoshiko Takahashi , who heads the School Management Research Department within the Tokyo Board of Education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in schools , it had to include families . Parents have great responsibility for teaching kids character . " This might sound self-evident to North American or European ears , but children here spend an enormous amount of time in school or educational settings . Takashi Ozawa , for instance , comes home from school at 3 p.m. , studies , eats , then heads to a cram school from 6 p.m. to 9:30 p.m . On Mondays , he squeezes in an English class . <p> It takes a village Moreover , Japanese see a child 's development as a community responsibility , and to ask if the ministry 's report interferes in private lives is to draw blank looks . " Schools and parents are responsible for raising children , " says Akiko Haga , of the Tokyo Board of Education , who describes this attitude as a part of Japan 's collective " village mentality . " Ms. Haga attributes many of the current problems to Japan 's rapid postwar modernization and its erosion of the village mentality . Rebuilding Japan meant men worked long hours , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family homes once housed several generations , nuclear families became the norm . The ministry guidelines , Haga says , are an attempt to recreate old family values . They recommend , among other things , more family chats ; less dependence between mothers and their children , and more parenting by fathers . Another suggestion is to give children household chores . Often , children are not expected to set the table or do any work around the house because mothers want to keep them free to study . Critics call the guidelines a flight of fancy . " I want the education ministry and the government to face reality , " says Tokyo psychologist Naoko Misawa , who has worked extensively with young children . She says families have degenerated to the point where they ca n't function properly . " Japan succeeded in raising good corporate warriors , but failed in raising family men . It 's a problem with this country . " Indeed , the ministry 's report does seem to run counter to the accepted order of things in Japan today , where individuality is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play and maximum study , and where fathers are often absent . Certainly this has been the Ozawas ' experience . Like many fathers , Takashi 's dad has been posted to another province and is home only on weekends . Because the Ozawas want Takashi to do well , father-son time is devoted to math and science review . Soccer comes second . " Japanese husbands think training and education are a mother 's job , " explains Ozawa , as she and Takashi enjoy a post-school , pre-cram-school piece of cake at their dining room table . " They 're always busy working hard and think it 's important for their family to do that . " She does n't resent the ministry 's attempt to tell her how to raise her child , but says its recommendations are misguided . " It 's unrealistic because the core problem wo n't change - society and the way it 's structured , " she says . " It may happen over 10 to 20 years , but they 'd have to get rid of entrance exams first . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Some people may call it unrealistic , " says Ms. Takahashi , " but we ca n't change anything that way . " The report signals what the ideal is . " This gives parents a great opportunity to ask , ' What are the basics ? ' " <p> A GOVERNMENT 'S GUIDE FOR PARENTING The Japanese Ministry of Education 's answer to a rash of youth crimes : better parenting . In a recently released report , the ministry outlined how parents could improve their child-rearing . * Encourage kids ' goals and dreams . * Have more family talks . * Plan family activities . * Do n't meddle too much in your kids ' business . * Fathers should spend more time with their children . * Teach children responsibility by giving them chores . * Read with your children . * Expose kids to plants and pets to foster a respect for life . * Limit what is watched on TV. * Do n't let children lock themselves in their rooms . * Recognize that play is important . * Praise your children . * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yoshiko Matsushita contributed to this report
