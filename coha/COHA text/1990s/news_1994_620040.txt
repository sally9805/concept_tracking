<p> " Sex in the workplace ? Sex is the workplace , " says one woman when I mention the subject . It may be significant that she is in advertising . Another woman , who has just made partner in a prestigious law firm , has a diametrically different perspective . " I 've never been involved with anyone or seen anyone else in such a situation , " she says . " And when I 'm told that there 's something going on in my firm , my jaw drops . " <p> Here we have the full spectrum , from hyperactivity to inactivity , of what has become the most disputed , most avoided , most explosive topic of the ' 90s office . The furor over sexual harassment rages like an undeclared war between men and women . But lost in the screaming matches ( and icy silences ) over this admittedly murky area is the most common manifestation of workplace sexuality , that which is neither consent nor coercion : the sexually tinged looks , words and exchanges that take place every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of careers . <p> There are , after all , encounters between men and women that do n't lead to wrack and ruin , mental distress or mega-dollar lawsuits . Drowned out in the so- called debate are the delicate moments when sex and work come together for what may be a brief flirtation . . . or a lasting union . Nor do we hear much about the times when the overbearing male is sent packing by a joke or a rebuff ; when a possible instance of harassment is deflected by an intelligent woman . <p> With all the litigation prompted by the crossing of those ever- elusive boundaries , one hardly dares allude to the part played by charm and seduction in the evolution of one 's career . But , in truth , the sparks of mutual attraction are a natural element in the atmosphere of any office , and some people build careers on understanding how to ignite them . <p> We all know those people  --  male and female  --  who seem to have been born knowing how to seduce . Their flattery is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at you and listen intently , focus like laser beams . For that moment , you 're the only person on earth . The report you 're explaining is utterly fascinating . You 're putty in their hands , at least for the first three or four encounters . From there , the exchange becomes more serious ( and more extracurricular ) , or the flirtation settles into a mutually beneficial ( but completely harmless ) pattern . Or , after you 've used up all your prime insights and your ideas are running a little thin , you catch a wavering of the gaze . Time for another target . It may not be flattering , but it 's not lethal , either . <p> Sex has always been in the workplace , more or less , just as it has always been in the family , more or less . The taboos governing one may be more stringent than those governing the other , but seduction , manipulation and the eroticizing of power create currents and tensions that underlie most of our interactions . Not jut between men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . Starting with the original family romance , desire mixed in with the love of mothers and fathers , we move on to their surrogates : teachers and camp counselors , the mentors in high school who are gradually joined , but never replaced , by peers . The workplace is a continuation of those yearnings of adolescence . We do n't like to admit it  --  do n't really have a framework in which to discuss it  --  but the chemistry between colleagues collaborating on a new account , drawing up a proposal or making a breakthrough in research can be one of the most erotic things going . <p> The dynamic of workplace sex was once the preserve of male bosses and female secretaries . The image was that of a middle- aged man susceptible to the blandishments of an eyelash-batting underling with shapely legs and plunging blouse . The rewards were a pay raise for her and an affair for him , and the whole thing was conducted in a manner that was meant to be sub-rosa but rarely was . " In the ' 70s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office was a singles bar , only respectable . " Now the dynamic is quite different , with women struggling alongside and competing with men , and with mentor relationships taking on other dimensions , including role reversals . <p> Although the glass ceiling is still largely intact , there are certainly enough women in middle management and , in smaller companies , top management  --  as well as female entrepreneurs  --  that the boss-secretary duo can be female-female or female-male without provoking a sexual identity crisis . In movies of the ' 40s , when a woman was in a position of authority , she had to be punished for her lack of femininity and the anxiety such role reversal produced . In the pioneering " His Girl Friday , " Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell jostle and spar as editor and ace reporter , their antagonism both covering up and revealing the tremendous chemistry between them . But a really competent and well-educated woman executive is still fodder for sexist humor ( consider the villainous role played by Sigourney Weaver in " Working Girl " ) . Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and erotic possibilities of men and women working together . Think of Holly Hunter leading virgin network correspondent William Hurt through his first newscast in " Broadcast News . " It 's an emergency situation , they 're both in a tight spot , communicating by earphone , and as they work the high- wire act together , we feel the high  --  both erotic and professional  --  that goes with it . <p> People who are shy or awkward in the world outside the office can come into their own at work ; it becomes the medium of courtship , an arena where , unlike a date , they do n't have to be self- conscious about whether they 're pleasing or whether they 'll be rejected . <p> As a southerner , I may be open to charges of special pleading , regional bias , in acknowledging  --  and , in some cases , approving of  --  sexual sparks in the office . No self-respecting southern woman would think of invading male territory without all the tricks of womanly warfare at her disposal . Did I , in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company , stoop to flirting with my colleagues and boss ? You bet . Did I enjoy my position as the only woman in a department of male colleagues ? Same answer . But my charms , such as they were , were deployed  --  as I believe are those of many southern women  --  less to advance my career than to allay the fears of men . And there 's the rub : A certain kind of flirtatiousness becomes a form of dissembling , a mask to hide one 's brains and ambitions . <p> Which undermines the point of most people 's workplace flirtations . As is often the case , what seems to be about sex is really about something else : power . Men use power one way , women another , but both tend to deny their power , like rich people who want to believe that people love them for themselves and not their money . <p> For women , flirting can be deceptive : A woman distracts a man and gains power over him . But the person in the actual power seat still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male . There are innumerable men who still feel a kind of compulsion to come on to a woman  --  their masculinity depends on it . Underlying it all may be a fear of women 's power , but the form that fear takes can be pretty lethal to women . Thus , women often feel caught between men who are either sexual aggressors or closet misogynists . I have several friends who have gotten in trouble with bosses  --  and gotten fired  --  simply because they were women : adult , smart and . . . threatening . <p> The balance is still lopsided , with women gaining some of the power but shouldering the lion 's share of sexual responsibility . In many of the stories I 've heard , women somehow end up with the burden of having to intuit which way the wind is blowing , to fend off delicately ; the burden of having to think about it in advance . <p> " The problem , " says Alexandra , a computer programmer , " is that to get the job , you have to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to make people like me . It 's a never-ending chess game , where the idea is to checkmate the king and not lose the queen . " <p> It is not always an easy game to finesse . A friend did some writing for a magazine editor who was a notorious womanizer . She was married and figured a few flirtatious lunches could n't hurt  --  the editor was so enthusiastic about her writing , his suggestions so brilliant . ( For many of us now , our sexual vanity is our work : Remember Woody Allen reading Dianne Wiest 's play in " Hannah and Her Sisters " ? She waits with bated breath until Allen , a potential mentor , pronounces it " good . " ) But then my friend found out that the editor had been bragging to his editor , the owner of the publication and **26;34;TOOLONG , about his affair with her . Moral : You simply ca n't know if someone you work for is a pathological liar or some other form of neurotic specimen , but you can bet that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sexual arena . Trouble may come not when you cross the line but when you are perceived as having crossed it . <p> The more people I talked to about where that line is drawn , the more this article took the form of an ongoing argument  --  between men women , between women in different professions , between women and myself , between myself ( younger ) and myself ( today ) . The one unifying principle , implicit in discussions that veer away from harassment toward subtler expressions of sexuality , was women 's liking for men and a certain confidence in their ability to handle a sticky situation . Very few women I talked to had been subjected to advances they could n't manage or rebuff . <p> These situations seemed to come in two varieties : come-ons by men who knew better but felt it a badge of manhood to play out the sexual game , whether invited or not ; and men who misunderstood a woman 's " platonic " interest . <p> Of course , knowing that the chemistry is there does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . Restraint is the better part of valor in a working relationship . If you 're getting ( or giving ) mixed signals , chances are you 're headed for trouble . Look at what happened in " Fatal Attraction . " Michael Douglas and Glenn Close , after meeting and being drawn to each other in a publisher 's office , have lunch , during which they dance around each other and the prospect of a fling ( it 's the best scene in the movie ) . They flirt , trying to establish whether they 're speaking the same language , negotiate the ground rules  --  i.e. , a no- strings one-night fling . They seem to come to terms , until later , when Close comes after Douglas with a knife and a paternity suit . " You broke the rules ! " he cries . And she did . What 's the moral of this story ? <p> There are several . One is , beware of the no-strings affair . Insinuating themselves into any union of two people are the long tentacles of the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no such thing as a " sex- only " encounter . Another is , make sure you 're on an equal footing , with the parity of both being married or unmarried , and on the same professional level . Paul Newman was once quoted as saying he 'd have an affair only with a woman who had as much to lose as he did , and that 's a pretty good rule of thumb . Douglas has a marriage , a home and a child ; Close has none of these . Then there 's the clash that no one to my knowledge has pointed out : He 's a lawyer ; she 's in publishing . Different personality types : He 's literal and unemotional ; she 's imaginative and self-dramatizing . Finally , when all other differences pale , he 's a man ; she 's a woman . He wants sex . She wants love . It 's a sexual stereotype that may be changing , but I suspect there 's still a lot of truth in it . <p> And there 's another cliche that still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men to blur the boundaries between the professional and the personal . It makes us seem more humane , but also less able to be detached when necessary . It 's something we continually have to watch out for  --  empathy is our strong suit , but it can make us vulnerable in certain situations : when we reach out to someone who does n't want our help ; when something we 've done has been criticized and we take it as a personal assault . There are myriad sensitivities that can interfere with our work and our work relations rather than coming to their aid . The sexual arena is one in which a little detachment , a little realistic appraisal , might help . <p> Marian , a psychiatric social worker , described a situation in which she found herself lunching regularly with man who was something of a guru at the institution where she worked : a shy , scholarly older man with whom she had wonderful , stimulating conversations . One day , riding back to the office in a cab , he lunged . She recoiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How could he do that ? " she moaned to her analyst at their next session . <p> " How could he not ? " asked the analyst . <p> Of course . She realized that she simply had n't wanted to see him as a potential lover and had blinded herself to all the unconscious shadings and inevitable consequences of their intense rapport . Surely , I suggested to Marian , there would have been an intermediate step , a conversational way to lay your cards on the table mutually . <p> " No , " she said . " In this case , I was behaving seductively . I wanted him to fall for me , and I was n't willing to pay the price . " <p> Ah , with freedom comes responsibility . Another cliche , perhaps , but one women still have trouble with . After all , we 've only recently emerged from a world in which sexual activity was synonymous with being a fallen woman , a tart . We 're used to being sought , protesting , then allowing ourselves to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when women were ladies , there was no question about what sex meant . It was verboten . If it happened , it led to marriage , and that set the limits all the way down the line . Now nobody knows quite where the boundaries are . This leads to an increase in misunderstandings , with a single act or gesture open to multiple interpretations . What some people would see as a crossing of the line others might hardly notice . A flip remark made to the wrong person may be greeted with more horror than a physical come-on made to another . <p> A male friend who owned a financial-counseling firm was asked by a client to give secretarial work to his niece , a conscientious , quiet girl . One day , as a tease , my friend Walter leaned over her shoulder and said , " Why do n't you stop pretending and get back to the street , where you belong ? " Before he knew what was happening , the young woman had fled  --  for good . It was the first time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joke had misfired completely . He had not only failed to understand how he was perceived , but had assumed that even a very young woman in the rough-and-tumble business world of New York would be sophisticated enough to fend off a playful , Murphy Brown-like insult . <p> When both people are experienced professionals , the intent of a flirtation  --  or harassment  --  is usually clear , even if it 's not admitted . Caroline , a medical researcher , told me the story of an Ivy League professor who interviewed her for a job over lunch : " At the end of the lunch , he kissed me , or tried to . I just dismissed it , deciding it was meant as a friendly gesture , and took the job . A few weeks after we 'd been working together , he walked into my office and shut the door  --  which was appropriate for what we were doing  --  but then looked at me and said , ' I ca n't believe this , but I 'm falling madly in love with you . ' It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then I got upset . I realized this was for real and that I had understood the intent behind the first encounter . I walked over and held the door for him to leave . What I could n't get over was how inept he was . I 'd been in plenty of situations where a man would make a remark , then wait to see if you 'd respond . I 'd given him no encouragement ; I was happily married , and he knew it . Then , a few months later , we were both attending a meeting in New York and found ourselves alone in an elevator . He tried to kiss me again . This was not acceptable . I backed off , rebuffed him . Then he got embarrassed and pretended it was an accident . <p> " This was a very sexist , very obnoxious man , but eminent in his field , and I did n't know what to do . I was new in the job and in the area . I wondered : Was this typical of the university ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other women not be offended by what I thought was odious behavior ? I finally got together with some women friends , and that was very helpful . Then I found out he had an international reputation ( for behaving this way ) . For years I was constantly nervous about his contact with research assistants and younger women who might not know how to handle the situation . Now I would tell them , ' Do n't get in a room alone with him . ' But then I was afraid I 'd be held responsible if I blew the whistle , or that I 'd be branded a troublemaker . Finally , a woman on the faculty reported him to his dean . Everyone was told that if it ever happened again , it was the end for him . But I 've had reports that he 's still there and , no doubt , still at it . " <p> The specter of sexual harassment has a chilling effect in most offices . Law firms are especially sensitive to the issue , as are universities , both hotbeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to have a female teaching assistant , " one male professor confessed , while a female student complained that professors are nervous about having conferences with students of the opposite sex . <p> In fact , situations in which women are the harassers and wreak vengeance on men for rejecting them seem to exist mostly in the fevered brains of paranoid writers like Michael Crichton , who recently brought us " Disclosure , " and David Mamet , whose play " Oleanna " deals with a student 's false accusations against her professor . Their vision of women as sexual Furies bent on destruction may play well to a world confused by the emergence of women as professionals , but reality still favors men , and what Mamet and Crichton really seem to be angry about is the refusal of women to play traditional roles as stay-at-home wives or submissive helpmeets . In " Oleanna , " a whiny female student turns , implausibly , into a feminist termagant , and in " Disclosure , " the author 's ire appears to be directed less at the sexually blackmailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The pleasing-woman role is still one of the devices most often used to get by and get ahead at work . " You have to show you have a sense of humor , which usually means laughing at your boss ' jokes , but only when they 're really funny , " says Alexandra , the computer programmer . " If they begin going over the line , just use a pained smile . The trick is to make the laugh so warm and pleasing that the boss will stay on the other side just to enjoy the warmth he gets from it . If you 're generally cheerful , just by stopping the cheerfulness , by turning it on and off , you can exercise a great deal of control . <p> " I 'm all for the feminist movement , " Alexandra continues , " because it tends to make men more cautious and easier to control . Even if things have gone a little overboard , if it will just stop men from reflexively making sexual remarks , it 's a good thing . On the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The main thing is not to be too obvious , to dress attractively but not provocatively . Many women overplay their hands by coming on too strong too soon . It creates confusion for the man and can cause serious misunderstandings . " <p> Veronique Vienne , a creative director who has worked in several corporations , freely admits to flirting at work , and liking it . " Frenchwomen all flirt . It 's a way of taking control , " she says . " I flirt with guys who are having bad days . I hug them , put a kiss on their forehead . You have to feel self-confident about your own sexuality ( to do it well ) , " she adds . " If you 're married or have a good relationship with a man , it 's easier to be relaxed in the office . " <p> Sarah , an editor from North Carolina , says , " I know the word flirt has a bad odor  --  it sounds cheap  --  but what goes on between a man and a woman is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's not just ' Hey , you turn me on , let 's hop in the sack . ' It does n't have to go that far at all . In fact , what we call flirting may be a way of acknowledging sexual tension without having sex . It 's all the little byplay , the thrust and parry by which a male and female acknowledge their attraction and discover what is special about it . <p> " For instance , I love to tease . I 'm very good at it , and a lot of men love it . With those who respond , it makes them relax . It tells them I 've noticed them . With those who do n't , it becomes a form of hidden aggression , and I stop . " <p> Vienne stepped over the line once and has never forgotten it : " I once had a French boss who brought out the worst in me . He did n't flirt ; he was very straight , and so was I with him . But one day he walked into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day he wore a blue tie  --  and I said , ' You look wonderful . That blue tie goes with your eyes . ' Instantly I knew our relationship had taken a turn . He was very embarrassed , but I think I was more embarrassed . I had stepped over a subtle border . I had allowed myself to do what men do all the time . We got back on track after that , " she remembers , " and I had increased respect for him . I saw he was not someone I could manipulate . " <p> A compliment , Vienne points out , paid in a certain way , stymies the recipient and gives an advantage to the complimenter . " It 's a form of aggression , " she says . " Maybe I was late on a report . It was a way to dispel the tension . There was a certain manipulation in it . " Men do it almost unconsciously , and women practice it as an art form . <p> " Now , " Vienne says , " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man or a woman . On the other hand , my feeling is that there are sexual tensions between men and women , and to deny it is puritanical , noncreative and counterproductive . The tensions are mutual , and normal . Acting on them is unwise , but acknowledging them is honest . " <p> The lawyer who finds that sex in the workplace has never been an issue for her is a very attractive woman in her late 40s who , having raised two children , is both work- and family-minded . " Maybe it 's because I was n't looking for it , " she says . " And because it is a law firm : the sensitivity of the issue now and the nature of the work  --  long hours , having to be above reproach , and it being a conservative profession and therefore more straitlaced in the first place . " <p> And your male colleagues ? I ask . <p> " They 've always treated me as a colleague rather than a sex object . I have late-night dinners or trips with clients , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncomfortable situation . If someone does come on at work or makes an inappropriate remark , I just slough it off . Usually , a man who does that has a reputation , and he 's done it with other women . " All in all , she feels , as more and more women join firms , they will set their own terms , signal exactly what they want . <p> Barbara Roberts , the president of FPG , a stock-photography agency , has been misquoted , she says , by the Wall Street Journal as suggesting that women on Wall Street have to accept that male flirtation and aggressiveness come with the territory . In fact , she feels that women should " conserve their energy " by choosing their battles and tolerating " a little bit " of this behavior . But she describes the thoroughly liberating feeling of being in a woman-owned company now , after ending almost two decades as a senior vice president and director at Dean Witter . Being a beautiful woman on Wall Street , she says , meant " 18 years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman first and foremost . It created such stress that it was one of the reasons I left . It 's horribly annoying , when you 're really interested in your work , to rarely be allowed to forget that you 're a woman . Now I run my own company , where there are no demarcations between old and young , black and white , gay and straight . You 're taken only for your talent , and it 's totally freeing . If you have a culture where everyone treats each other with respect , flirtation is not an issue . I know that being a woman helped me in my career on Wall Street , but I would come home in a rage at the end of the day . I found that I was n't being true to myself . I wanted to forget I was a woman , and I had a problem with southern women who did use their sex . " <p> Yes , I thought , I agree . It 's why I do n't do it anymore . But why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the end , getting and succeeding at a job is a complicated and often desperate process , even without the gender trade- offs a woman must constantly calculate . We tend to rely on the tools we know best . Sometimes they 're helpful and harmless ; sometimes not . <p> The worst thing we can do is approach each situation as if it were a mine field about to explode into a melodrama . Every woman can point to a bad scene here and a bad scene there , and though we 're less sure of the rules now than ever before , we have to keep going . Instead of straitjacketing ourselves in the interest of purging the workplace of any whiff of danger  --  and desire  --  it is perhaps wiser , and certainly more realistic , to accept and enjoy a little spillover of affection and attraction . On the other hand , in an ongoing , intimate setting like an office , the idea of a " no-strings affair " is an oxymoron . Like " safe sex , " or " one-night stand . @ @ @ @ @ @
