// It 's been called the strangest 75 square miles on the North American continent . Craters of the Moon National Monument , in southern Idaho , is the caldera of not just one volcano , but of an immense rupture called the Great Rift , a 60mile-long crack in the earth . The rupture is the source of numerous fissure vents , 25 volcanic cinder cones , and 60 different lava flows formed over 15,000 years , most recently 2,000 years ago . Volcanic activity here is by no means extinct ; geologists predict another eruption some day . The park is only 75 miles from Sun Valley , and the Park Service grooms about five miles of trail for Nordic skiing each winter . The flatter terrain is great for beginning skinny skiers , and the cinder cones are perfect for novice to intermediate telemark skiers , with some of the sweetest , dreamiest powdered sugar this side of Alta . Some of the most surreal geologic features are only a few minutes ' ski from the parking lot . Farther out , beyond the monument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a vast region of stark volcanic features flanking the Great Rift . But it 's not for winter novices . Though the touring is easy , Craters in winter is far from tame . First , middle , and last , there is the weather : The same loop around the cinder cones that is an afternoon s lark in summer can become a major expedition in winter . Because of topography and elevation , the park is a climatic as well as geologic island , attracting brutal cold and snows that leave surrounding areas unscathed . Though the air may be warm and the ground bare only three miles away , a mere 300 feet lower , Craters can have icy winds , deep snowpack , and whiteout storms that victimize the unprepared . There are other dangers , too : Venture off the paths , and at best you may find your skis shredded by sharp lava rocks . At worst you could fall as much as 60 feet through the " skylights " of hidden lava tubes , treacherous pitfalls camouflaged by snow that are the remnants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park is called the " Devil 's Orchard . " But we are intrigued by the rivers of petrifled lava flows and gardens of rugged lava monoliths and cinder cone basis ; and by the caves , lava tubes , tunnels , and spatter cones . Four of us-a Baby Boomer crew from Montana , happiest in winter with skis on our feet-were drawn to the prospect of skiing through these wonders , a new frontier for all of us . We 've lived much of our lives on the edge , around the fringes of convention . Beverly is a magazine editor , author , and neighborhood piano teacher who has carved out a life for herself in the rugged country just east of the Continental Divide . Tim is , as Beverly calls him , " my OTL " or Own True Love , an artist and teacher who threw over a big house and affluent lifestyle in Pittsburgh to come West and be an environmental activist . And Oliver , my OTL and favorite TC ( traveling companion ) , will ski just about anything , and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our first day at Craters proves to be seductive enough-a bluebird sky and a warm , bright sun make it hard to believe the weather here could ever be anything but temperate . We set out on the main trail and soon discover fine-grained powder that is a delight against our skis . The most versatile boards for these conditions are the backcountry touring skis I 'm on , which are a kind of hybrid between cross-country skinny skis and downhill telemark skis : They boast wide shovels and metal edges , but still have double camber and are available waxless . The metal edges give control and responsiveness for turning , especially when conditions get icy . The double camber provides liveliness for touring , and the wide shovels allow flotation on untracked powder . Oliver wears his with mohair climbing skins , giving him the advantage in scaling steeper slopes while still permitting plenty of downhill glide . Tim and Beverly get along well enough on conventional skinny skis . We gaze out over the Green Dragon Flows , which extend five miles to the east but seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains . The lava beds look like fields of blackened , petrified vomit , stippled with white . They are punctuated by monoliths of craggy lava , blocks of the North Crater that broke free and rafted here on lava flows ; they now stand like statues . With contorted snags of long-dead limber pines framing the scene , the flows appear as enormous , haunted graveyards . Soon we are banking around the North and Paisley cinder cones , snowcovered foothills of highly porous black and red pebbles , that rise 500 feet above us . The leeward slopes of these gentle mounds-they are 15 to 20 degrees in pitch-make great beginning telemark terrain : gradual enough to ascend without skins and just steep enough to gather speed for a long series of linking turns . Oliver , Beverly , and I frequently detour off the main trail and up onto the cones ' flanks . Each slope seems better than the last , and by late afternoon-our turnaround time-our looping tracks adorn the cones for a mile . That evening we pull into the village of Arco , 19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , society , and slumber . Arco is a down-at-the-heels and forgotten desert town , with a smattering of motels and restaurants . It 's a haphazard place : Liquor , for example , can be found at the hardware store , which is open when the sign on the door says CLOSED , and closed when the sign says OPEN . The town is littered with boarded-up hotels and bleak , empty storefronts , as well as the pitted remnants of wonderful murals of mountain scenes , painted in full color on the foundations and walls of buildings in every block . These murals seem all that remain of the dreams of an earlier era . Where to stay ? We opt for the D-K Motel , which becomes our base camp for the duration . The D-K boasts friendly and helpful proprietors , clean rooms with phone and cable and kitchenettes , bathtubs , passably firm mattresses , and a marquee inviting us to SKI THE MOON . A short walk away is Pickles Restaurant ; its main virtues are a nonsmoking dining area , homemade hash browns made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pickles . Over our pickle and potato supper , we spread topographic maps across the table and plot our next day of skiing . We plan to climb the Inferno Cone , accessible from the main trail , and telemark down its 500 feet of vertical . The next day dawns overcast and is comfortably in the 20s , but windy . The trail begins as wind-scoured ice but soon reverts to remarkably dry powder that has blown over yesterday 's tracks . Beverly skis ahead and up onto some of the angular , erratic volcanic-rock formations , then down the icy windpack on the other side . We begin our ascent up a saddle , looking back now and then to glimpse the vast expanse of snow-covered volcanic landscape below us and the Green Dragon and Serrate lava flows that reach out to the plains . Each time we gain enough elevation to make several linking tele turns , we about-face and descend before resuming our climb . We 're having a blast , and we 're only about two miles from the parking lot . " Now this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a particularly satisfying descent . Photograph Spatter cones-minivolcanoes formed as the lava flow cooled and became tacky-are one of Craters oddest features . // After yo-yoing our way gradually to the top of the saddle , we look over the other side into the crater basin . The light is so flat it is nearly impossible to read the lay of the land : Is that slope a gradual descent , or is there a drop-off partway down ? Tim and I feel our way down with our skis in the blinding white , then ascend a small rise ; we stop and look back in time to see Beverly and Oliver telemarking down behind us , making figure eights around our figure 11s . Oliver , with his mohair skins , easily beats us to the top of Inferno ; he can ski straight up the cone . The rest of us make a zig-zag approach , angling first south , then kick-turning to face north and angling up again . The higher we go , the more wind crust and ice we encounter , and the more we rely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the slope . . Near the top of the cone , under the lee side of a magnificent old limber pine , its outstretched arms twisted into graceful curves , we find shelter on a bare patch of black cinders . We shed our skis here and , using poles for balance on the uneven but shallow snow , head up to explore the summit of the cone , leaving behind smudged black footprints from the cinders . " It looks like chimney sweeps have been here , " laughs Beverly . At the park bench and interpretive sign on top , the wind roars into us from across the open desert . For seemingly hundreds of miles in any direction , the world is etched in black and white , like a scratchy old silent film . It 's a study in monochrome , a charcoal sketch of the chain of cinder cones along the Great Rift . Big Cinder Butte , one of the largest basaltic cinder cones in the world , towers above the lava plain in the distance . The scene is as otherworldly as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violently , pelting our faces and blinding us with needle-sharp snow . We decide to retreat to the protection of the cinder-cone basin and head back to the car . As we defrost ourselves in the car , we agree we 've earned a good supper , and we are determined to avoid a pickle-andpotato repeat in Arco . At the enthusiastic suggestion of our motel proprietress , we head 44 miles north up U.S. 93 to the town of Mackay and the Bear Bottom Inn . The inn is an old house in town , lovingly restored by a mother-and-daughter team . Wooden bear statues flank the front door , and dancing bears are stenciled on the inside walls , which are also decorated with several varieties of barbed wire . The Western kitsch decor continues at the bar , where bottom halves of the stools are chainsaw sculptures of horses , cowboys , high-button-booted ladies , and loggers . Seated , you acquire , centaurlike when viewed from behind , a new bottom half . After the dismal cuisine of Arco , the Bear Bottom Inn is heaven . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daniels pepper sauce for the excellent steaks , is created right there in the kitchen . We are grateful for one another 's company on yet another adventure in the snow , grateful for the perfect balance of flavors on our palates , and eager for our next and last day at Craters , when we 'll explore the spatter cones beyond Inferno . During the night , 11 inches of new snow falls : dense , damp snow , the consistency of a new cake of cream cheese , snow that portends avalanche danger . Before we even reach the park , we decide to avoid the cinder cones and pass on yo-yoing . The danger of slab avalanches is high , and the snow is so stiff it would torque our knees , anyway .

Craggy monoliths ( below ) punctuate the vast lava fields . // The wild blows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are intimidating like an enemy army storming our battlements , it rages into the huge plate-glass windows , a horizontal rant . However , both Oliver and Beverly feel comfortable with the extreme conditions , and we all must return home tomorrow . If we want to see the spatter cones , only two to three miles out , it 's now or never . " Hey , if you wait for perfect weather in this climate , you 'll never do anything , " says Tim . " Let 's get going and see how bad it is . If you do n't go , you wo n't know . " So we set out , storm jackets zipped to our noses , hood brims shielding our faces , fleece pants gathering rime . It 's not very cold , just very windy , and as soon as we 're on the lee side of the North Crater , it 's actually pleasant to be out . When we begin our ascent of the saddle , we 're rewarded for our perseverance by the sun peeking out . Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panorama of the Lost River Range rising to the north , far out beyond the lava . Beverly and I hoot with delight and hop bunny-fashion on our skis into the wind , exhilarated by its embrace . Over the top we go , turning down into the lovely crater basin , which now has long shadows cast across it by the windsheared limber pines . In the crater basin the snow is gently drifted in wind ripples , or sastrugi . They look like topographic map contours , or ripples of sand eroded by the sea . The sastrugi are beautiful , creating a lovely texture across the rolling belly of the basin as they glint in the sun . Their appearance is adequate compensation for the rough skiing surface they create . Photograph Stray off the trail , and sharp-edged lava rocks can shred ski bases ; lava tubes covered by snow " skylights " can be as dangerous as crevasses. // We mount the easy saddle between Inferno Cone to the east and the Big Craters to the west , then glide down to the spatter cones on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Blue Dragon lava flows , which reach out 10 miles and beyond into the darkness of an oncoming storm . The spatter cones are minivolcanoes , less than 50 feet high . They were formed when the gases in the molten lava dissipated ; the lava then lost its frothy quality and became tacky in texture , so that it was tossed out of the vent as globs of lava paste called spatter . The globs partially welded together to build up spatter cones , much the way wet sand dribbled on the beach will form a sand castle . From a distance and when silhouetted against the white of the cinder cones , they look mysterious and dark , like medieval castles perched on isolated peaks , their high battlements clinging to the ragged rock . A path winds up the face of one spatter cone , and we take off our skis to climb into its maw . The cone 's surface is broken and jagged , like a mound of peanut brittle or rock candy , all hard edges , angles in every direction , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into sinuous shapes as well . " It looks like sea kelp , " observes Tim . Inside the cavernous mouth of the cone are permanent drifts of snow ; they never melt because volcanic rock is such a good insulator . We peer down into the dark beyond and wonder how deep the cavern goes . Signs tell us the lava came from 40 miles within the earth 's core . Down the rabbit hole ? We 're not that curious . Beyond the spatter cones are twisted dead trees and more crater-wall fragments and the vast reaches of the Blue Dragon Flow . But as we begin our exploration down the North Crater Trail , the weather shifts , and we 're broadsided by violent winds carrying hard snow pellets and by black cinders whipping vertically into the sky . We decide to ski into the protection of some trees twisting in the gale ; the wind is so forceful it actually pushes us uphill . Suddenly the cinder cones and all other landmarks vanish in a whiteout . Conditions change so swiftly , it 's shocking . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We agree to change course and return to the car by following the metal posts that mark a nearby paved road every 20 feet or so . This route is about a mile longer , but it offers the comfort of a marked trail . Trying to navigate the cinder-cone basin without landmarks would be folly . Our anxiety is short-lived , however . Once we are back in the lee of the cinder cones , the wind abates and the low clouds lift . The ski back is gentle and rolling , and someone else had skied the route today and left us fresh tracks to follow . No more punching through white concrete to break trail . By now , both Tim 's and my knees ache from the hours of pulling through the heavy snow . Sore but serene from endorphin highs , we 're soon back in the car and on the highway , heading east into a shower of drifting clouds that skim the crest of the Lost River Range . Illuminated by the low afternoon sun , falling snow looks like beams from heaven striking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , falcons , and bald eagles soar , burdened by the prey in their claws ; the new snow must have given them an advantage in their hunt . At the junction of U.S. 93 , we turn north toward home . Wisps of clouds touch down on the surrounding peaks , backlit by the pinks , oranges , and reds of the sunset . With just a tiny leap of the imagination , the mountains look like volcanoes smoldering. s Sidebar Craters of the Moon National Monument Sidebar Craters of the Moon National Monumentis located in south-central Idaho , midway between Boise and Jackson , Wyoming . U.S. Highways 20 , 26 , and 93 give access to the park and are usually snowpacked in the winter . There is no public transportation to the park . Scheduled airlines serve Idaho Falls , Tw , ain Falls , and Hailey , near Sun Valley , where you can rent a car at the airport . The park 's visitor center is open daily in winter , except on holidays , from 8 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. The center offers free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topographic maps , and other information . For current snow conditions , call them at 208-527-3257 . The scenic loop , site of the groomed trail , is usually skiable from late November through March , with the best skiing in January . Temperatures range from 45 degrees to well below zero , and skiers should be prepared for blizzards and high winds at all times . Winter camping is permitted in the main campground ; however , it is not plowed , and skiers should be prepared to camp in the snow . Wood fires are not permitted anywhere in the park . The closest lodging is in Arco , 19 miles northeast of the park . The D-K motel ( 800-231-0134 ) , where we stayed , appeared to be the nicest in town . Rates range from $30 to $47 .
