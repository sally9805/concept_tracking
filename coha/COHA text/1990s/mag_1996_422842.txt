PROBABLY THE BIGGEST mistake fly fishermen make  --  and this includes so-called experts as well as mediocre anglers  --  is that we stick to one or two tried-and-true presentations 99 percent of the time . I even know a few otherwise excellent anglers who fish dry flies exclusively , no matter what the conditions . When the fish are n't taking , many anglers think that a change in pattern is a cure-all , though actually only a change in presentation will solve the problem . Except when they are swimming streamers during high-water conditions , fly fishermen usually present their flies with upstream casts . And why not ? For decades the experts have agreed that the dead-drift dry fly is the best tactic for surface-feeding trout , and the upstream weighted nymph is most productive for fish that seem glued to the bottom . It 's all too easy to convince ourselves that we 're being smart by playing the percentages . The only fly in this ointment , as you may have discovered , is that there are times when neither of these basic presentations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main reason for such failures is that heavily fished trout have seen an endless flotilla of floaters overhead and a steady procession of nymphs bumping them on their noses . Fish can get just as turned off by the same old presentation as they can by the same old fly pattern . After being pricked or caught and released several times , they 're just not having any more . Yet you do n't have to travel to wilderness waters to make decent catches . What you need to do is make your flies travel in a different though still natural manner . What are these alternative presentations ? Let 's start at the top with the dry fly and work our way down . It has recently become popular to give a dry caddisfly imitation an occasional twitch , preferably in an across and upstream direction  --  to imitate the flutterings of the egg layers . But few anglers ever do this with their mayfly patterns even though many mayflies , especially the larger species , frequently have difficulty getting airborne and hop and skitter before taking off . Whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen times or more , I wade up slightly above and across from him . Then I cast my fly out 2 feet above his lie and just twinkle it in the surface film with a slight twitch of my rod tip . Although this same floater may have previously failed to fool the fish on its own merits , the slight jiggle makes it look like it is alive , and that 's often the clincher . There are even times and places that call for a nearly straight downstream dry-fly presentation . Snags or trees that have toppled into the river are choice hangouts for trout . Often the only way you can get a floater to fish in such places is by drifting it down from upstream . The very tail ends of pools are usually best fished from above , too . At dusk , good fish tend to drop to the bottom of a pool to sip spent flies ; a favorite lie for such feeding is where the water starts to speed up and break into a riffle . If you try to cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below , however , the faster water near you will snatch your fly line . This is sure to hurry your fly , causing it to furrow the surface and alarm the fish . In both situations , it 's best to cast mainly but not directly downstream . Stand 5 feet or so to one side of a straight down-current line and stop your rod abruptly at the vertical on the forward cast . This will put enough slack in your line so that your fly floats down to the fish drag-free . If the fly floats past the fish untaken , tighten the line and let the fly swing directly below you , off to one side of the fish . Then you can pick it off the water to recast without spooking the fish . THEN THERE 'S AN OLD BUT NEARLY forgotten way to prospect for trout with an active floater . Remember Edward R. Hewitt 's Neversink skaters ? These flies were tied with oversized hackles on small light-wire hooks . Hewitt used to twitch them erratically across the surface of slow , deep pools ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even during the brightness of midday . I have n't seen any of Hewitt 's skaters in tackle shops for decades , but a big , well-greased variant on a smallish hook performs nearly as well . Dun and ginger/ grizzly are my favorite colors . Give this trick a try sometime when your favorite pool seems utterly dead . The old-fashioned winged wet fly is worth retrying , too . While its across and downstream swing may not be as deadly as a deep-drifted nymph on individual fish , you can cover many times more water . Overcivilized trout are n't used to seeing artificials behave this way nowadays . PERHAPS THE DEADLIEST OF ALL WET-fly presentations is the dancing dropper . This technique can be murder on fast runs and pocket water . To set up this rig , tie a bulky bucktail to the end of a rather stout leader . Pattern does n't matter . This is just a sea anchor to keep your line and leader taut against the current . About 3 to 4 feet up this leader , tie a dropper fly onto 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here , the fly type and pattern are extremely important . Choose a substantial fly . Size 10 or 12 is ideal . You have to offer the fish a meaty enough morsel to make its perilous trip to the surface worth the effort . Fat-bodied flies with soft hen or gamebird hackles are the best . When such all-hackle patterns enter and leave the surface film , their fibers expand and contract , as if the fly were a tiny octopus with a life of its own . Yellows , tans , and browns work best for me . Cast your pair of flies downstream , then hold your rod nearly vertical . Forget about the bucktail . Take in or let out line until the dropper is just kissing the surface . Dance this fly over likely lies . Also wobble your rod tip from side to side and up and down so that your fly zigzags as it skips in and out of the surface film . Do n't give up too quickly over obvious hotspots . A dry fly cast upstream on such water will float past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juicy , pulsing fly that hovers over its head for 30 seconds or more is usually too much to ignore . NYMPHS CAN BE FISHED IN DIFFERENT and enticing ways , too . A deep dead-drift nymph imitates an immature insect that has been dislodged or is migrating downstream . But what about nymphs and caddisfly pupae that are rising to the surface to hatch out ? Is n't this the time when trout feed on them most eagerly ? To imitate these upwardly mobile insects , much the same technique has been worked out independently on both sides of the Atlantic . Stream-keeper Frank Sawyer on Britain 's Hampshire Avon River developed the " induced take , " and the legendary Jim Leisenring of Pennsylvania limestone country gave us what is now known as the " Leisenring lift . " A nymph or all-hackle wet fly is cast several feet above a fish or its suspected lie . The artificial sinks as it dead-drifts downstream , and when it 's about a foot in front of the trout 's nose , the line is tightened  --  causing the fly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently hatching fly will often get the attention of a fish that has ignored the same pattern dead-drifted past it . You can exaggerate this rising action to fool trout that are taking emerging caddisflies , which usually zip to the surface much more abruptly than mayflies do . Position yourself directly above a rising fish , or nearly so . Cast your fly off to one side of the trout to get its exact measure , then haul in a foot of line . Cast directly at the fish , but stop your rod suddenly at the vertical as recommended above for casting a dry fly downstream . This will land your fly only halfway to the trout ; the fly will start sinking immediately on the slack line . When the line goes tight , your fly will rise vertically and quickly right in front of the fish 's nose . Only the most blase trout can ignore a fly behaving like this . Whether you choose a nymph or a caddisfly pupa imitation , your artificial will be more effective if it has been weighted with lead wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunk before it reaches the fish , the greater its upward rise will be  --  and the greater the temptation . EVEN MINNOW-IMITATING FLIES , which are usually fished mechanically across and downstream with a twitch retrieve , can benefit from a change of pace . One of the most productive streamer fishermen I know often uses his favorite fly in low water . He casts tiny inch-long patterns directly upstream and draws them back just slightly faster than the current . He claims this often stirs up fish that have ignored his nymphs and dries . By a freak accident years ago , I discovered a totally different way to present bucktails . I was fishing a 25-foot-wide stream , which produced mostly small stocked fish , not 50 miles from the Empire State Building . The stream did have one pool that I was convinced held bigger , perhaps even wild , trout . The only trouble with this paradise was that it was lined with willows , which made covering the water difficult . The only way I could fish this stretch was to inch upstream , belly-button @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limiting my presentation to roll-casting . I rarely saw rises in this deep water , so I usually fished it with a bucktail , feeling that " big fly , big fish " was the smart play here . One evening , during the split-second that my fly was racing along the surface before rolling up and over , a trout savaged my bucktail not 5 feet in front of me . Why my vintage bamboo rod did n't shatter , I 'll never know . But I landed that fish , a solid 16-incher , and still my personal best for that stream . That strike was a once-in-a-lifetime occurrence , but I still tried to figure out why that fish had gone after my fly so aggressively . There were two reasons , I concluded . First , a terrified baitfish racing along the surface was obviously being chased by another trout and the old carnivore wanted to get there first . Second , he had no time to stop , look , or listen before some reflex was triggered . I have never experienced another take halfway through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that re-creates the actions that made the fish strike . It works often enough so that I always try it before I leave a slow , deep hole . Since I ca n't possibly hand-strip line fast enough to keep the fly skittering on top , I cast the bucktail across-stream and the instant it hits the water , I raise my rod rapidly , wobbling the tip from side to side to zigzag the fly along the surface . Obviously , there are severe limitations to this technique . I ca n't keep the fly on top if I have more than 30 to 35 feet of line out . And I ca n't make the fly travel this way for more than 8 or 9 feet before I run out of rod length . The entire presentation lasts little more than a second . But that short sprint across the surface is often enough to nail a really good fish . I 'm fully resigned to the fact that neither I nor anyone else will be able to fool all of the fish all of the time . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wider variety of presentations , I really do fool more of the trout more of the time . <p>                     @x The Mayor Ignores the Rules <p> For someone born and bred right here in the rainwater basin of the central great plains , Llwellyn Jones-the mayor and presumptive leader of Emlyn Springs , Nebraska-is showing a sad lack of common sense . His ladyfriend and bedfellow for the past twenty-five years , Alvina Closs , is flummoxed . <p> " Ca n't you wait an hour ? " she is saying . " You can still get in nine holes-maybe even eighteen-after it blows over . " <p> " I 've got a tee time reserved , " he answers . " I 'm expected . " <p> " We do n't live in Miami ! " Alvina counters , shrilly . " It 's not as if there 's a crowd of people waiting to play . Why ca n't you wait ? " <p> " I 'm going now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No explanation . No compromise . <p> " You and your goddamned golf . " <p> He gives her a level , noncommittal look . " I 'll be home by happy hour , " he says . Then he turns around and walks up the stairs and toward the bedroom , his posture erect , his gait processional . If he thinks I 'm going to follow him up there , Viney says to herself , molars clenched , he 's got another thing coming . <p> Plenty of others share Viney 's agitation . The smallest and least civilized townsfolk are the most distraught : the babies , all of them , even the easy ones , are confounding their mothers with uncharacteristic , colicky behavior . The babies have been fed and changed and burped and read to and sung to and walked and held but still they are out of sorts . They are determined to cry , naptime be damned . There are grumpy toddlers , too , throwing tantrums , caterwauling in unison . Family pets all over town are nervous and misbehaving-fluttering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mangling good leather shoes even though they know better . Premenstrual girls are arguing with their mothers , moping in front of the television , or daydreaming on polyester bedspreads behind violently slammed doors . Teenaged boys contemplate their troubled complexions with dismay . Afternoon trysts are not going well . Noses tickle without relief . The carpenters in town curse and measure again , cut again , curse again , measure again . At the Williams ' mansion , Miss Hazel 's most promising student strikes a C-sharp . Hazel cringes in the parlor ; in the kitchen , her younger sister Wauneeta cringes , too . Downtown at the piano hospital , Blind Tom experiences a sudden unaccounted-for burst of tinnitus as he applies a cotton swab saturated with milk to a stained bit of ivory he found last week by the side of the road near Hallam . Next to the old train depot , the aged citizens encamped at the St. David 's Home for the Elderly are experiencing intestinal problems ; not a one of them , not even Mr. Eustace Craven , whose bowels have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has had a decent BM all day . <p> And in the living room of the house that has been Llwellyn Jones ' primary place of residence for a quarter of a century , Viney turns her back on the mayor and plants herself at the picture window-arms folded , mouth adamantly stitched shut , brows lowering , wearing an expression that no one but her dearest friend has ever seen . <p> Viney rarely frowns . She does five minutes of facial exercises and acupressure every morning and makes an effort to keep her countenance ( a word she routinely mispronounces as continence ) relaxed and neutral . Time need n't be the enemy . A person does n't have to spend a fortune on facelifts and creams . Alvina Closs is seventy-four years old , almost seventy-five , but she looks at least ten years younger . Maybe even fifteen . <p> She scrutinizes the ballooning clouds advancing from the south . The baby blanket blue of the sky is darkening , graying . She can hear Llwellyn banging around in the bedroom , opening and closing bureau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Viney ca n't for the life of her imagine what 's gotten into him . The mayor is usually so easygoing , a model of the compromising spirit . It 's one of the many reasons they 've stayed together for so long . <p> Many positive things could be said of Viney 's late husband Waldo , but a flexible nature was not one of them . They had sex in the same position their entire married life , and Waldo required some form of red meat at every meal . He 'd choke down a slice of turkey at Thanksgiving , but that was the extent of it . Chicken ? " Dirty birds , " he 'd say , although that did n't keep him from eating eggs fried in butter eight days a week . Fish ? Forget it , even when his friends brought home fresh perch from the Big Blue . It was meat , meat , meat with Waldo , which is why-Viney knows this for a fact-he dropped dead of a massive heart attack when he was only 32 years old , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a beautiful body . She 's still mad at him . <p> The window needs cleaning . They have n't had a good rain for days-although Viney 's oldest daughter said it sprinkled up in Omaha yesterday . The topsoil is parched , the wind has been relentless . There 's dust on everything . Viney takes up yesterday 's newspaper and her spray bottle of water and Coke and gets to it . <p> The picture window is a relatively new addition . Waldo installed it back in 1962 , not long before he collapsed in the parking lot of the Surf'n'Turf , where they 'd gone to celebrate their fifteenth wedding anniversary . Waldo was handy , that was one of his attributes . He made a lot of improvements to the house when he was alive . Up and down ladders , hammering , hoisting , sawing , drilling . All those comforting male noises . <p> Alvina Closs has been a widow longer than she was married . She 's been an adulteress longer than she 's been a wife . She would have dried up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heart , too-if it had n't been for Llwellyn Dewey Jones , and Hope . <p> Welly comes back downstairs and goes out through the kitchen door , not exactly slamming it but giving the action just enough oomph to set the door harp clanging over-energetically . What 's wrong with him ? <p> Viney hears him out in the backyard , thumping his shoes together , clearing off the dirt between the spikes . She pictures great bricks of dense sod being flung about the yard , and then falling into a serene , elliptical orbit with Welly at the center : a small angry god in argyle socks , giving birth to a new solar system in which the terrain of every planet is an immense , impeccably groomed PGA golf course . <p> Viney resumes window-cleaning . She does a few naso-labial stretches and waits for Welly to reappear . Surely he wo n't leave without patching things up . <p> Viney 's house is one of the oldest in town , if not the finest or fanciest : a whitewashed two-story saltbox built back in 1910 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her mother , aunts , and uncles were born here , as was Viney , as were Viney 's four children . She keeps her house , and Welly keeps his , even though they 've been sleeping together since the nation 's bicentennial . <p> In part , it 's for appearances ' sake-but it 's also because the house provides Alvina Closs with a sense of personal and historical continuity . Frankly , she 's never cared a good goddamn what people think of her and Llwellyn and their unusual arrangement , and she 's always deeply regretted the fact that Welly and the children did n't move in here after Hope went up . <p> But that 's a sore subject and another story entirely . <p> Welly is in the attached garage now-another of Waldo 's contributions-opening the garage door with the remote . Maybe he wo n't come back inside to say goodbye after all . <p> The phrase " friable earth " voices itself in Viney 's mind suddenly . Where has she heard that expression ? What does it mean ? She goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced the family Bible on the lectern with a massive Webster 's International Collegiate Dictionary . She makes a point of learning a new word every day and then using it in conversation . Staying mentally agile is crucial as one ages . There is no reason why a person should stop learning . Yesterday 's word was " sangfroid . " <p> And then she remembers : One of her granddaughters-the one who 's having so much trouble getting pregnant-told her recently that she was diagnosed as having a friable uterus . Viney was a registered nurse for over thirty years and maintains a keen interest in the medical field ; nevertheless this expression was unfamiliar . She did n't have the heart to ask what it meant at the time , and a good thing , too : <p> Friable , she reads . Brittle . Readily crumbled . Pulverable . <p> How in the world does a uterus crumble ? <p> Viney looks up . Llwellyn has backed out of the garage and is loading his clubs into the trunk of his Marquis . He 's going then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome-bears a sour residue , the result , she supposes , of their recent spat . <p> The sex in the beginning was very good , probably because it felt illicit , even though their adultery was completely sanctioned-more than that , encouraged - by Llwellyn 's wife Hope . <p> Viney and Welly still have sex , at least once a month , after lunch . Welly is an improviser , a person who bends , goes with the flow . They have their routines of course , but overall their life together has been one of freedom , quiet adventure , and discovery-both in and out of the bedroom . Viney has kept them on a semi-vegetarian lacto-ovo diet since 1980-relying heavily on Dr. Walker 's Diet and Salad and Juicing for Life - and she credits this with their physical health , mental acuity , and active love life . Viney pictures the two of them engaged in stimulating conversation over glasses of beet juice until they are well into their 100 's . Dr. Walker himself lived to be 110 . No one has yet found any reason whatsoever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago , when she charged through the front door of McKeever 's Funeral Home , and , ignoring staff urgings to be reasonable ( " State law my ass ! " she proclaimed ) , stormed down to the basement prep room to see Waldo 's pre-embalmed remains-such a strange word in that context , remains , because at that point Wally was still all there-she noticed a protrusion , something like a tent-pole , midway down the sheet . " What 's that ? " she 'd asked , even though she had a pretty good idea . She was thinking about the fact that it was her fifteenth wedding anniversary , her husband was dead , and never once had they had sex with her on top . <p> Malwyn McKeever repositioned himself so that she no longer had a view of Waldo 's nether-regions . " It 's a reflex , " Mal said , clearly embarrassed by the question . " A common post-mortem reflex . " <p> " That figures , " Viney muttered . She had stopped crying and was starting to feel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young and foolish enough back then to believe that the worst thing in the world had just happened to her . She did n't know anything . <p> She was curious to hear about how embalmers deal with post-mortem stiffies-imagining this almost made her laugh-but Mal 's face was as pink as a medium-rare steak . So she picked out a coffin , signed the papers , and ( vowing to never put herself through the experience of laying eyes on him again ) bid farewell to her beautiful dead husband 's erect remains . <p> She could never in a million years have gotten Waldo to drink carrot- ginger juice on a daily basis or sit through a program on educational television . <p> Why just last night she and Welly were watching one of those science shows on PBS about stem cell research and a whole new branch of study called regenerative medicine . There 's a group of doctors now who believe that people with spinal cord injuries can walk again . They 've done things like remove stem cells from people 's noses and pack them into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or necks or are suffering from some other kind of damage to their nervous systems . Lo and behold those cells start regenerating . People who 've never been able to do so much as wiggle a toe have started flexing their feet ! They 've even done this with a person 's heart , a young boy whose idiot friend was playing around with a nail gun and shot him right through the left ventricle . Nobody believed it was possible to regenerate heart tissue , but sure enough , they 've done it ! <p> Viney tried to engage Welly in a conversation about the TV show when they were getting ready for bed , but for some reason he was unusually quiet ( possibly the subject matter was upsetting given their shared history , the wheelchair-bound and so forth ) so she did n't push him . <p> Even though they have never officially tied the knot , they are bound together in all the ways that matter-through the rituals of everyday living , dependability , courtesy , and an innate sense of when to talk and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these days is , in Viney 's opinion , a bad idea . Living with another human being is a stormy enough proposition without stirring up trouble over this and that and every last little thing . As far as she can tell , this obsession with talking and listening , sharing feelings and so on has n't done one blessed thing for the institution of marriage . Just look at the statistics . Viney 's own children are example enough of the state of things : one divorced , one separated , one in counseling . None of Welly 's kids have ever even gotten married . Viney has always felt sad for them - and for Welly , too , with no grandbabies-but maybe it 's for the best . Co-habitation is not for the faint of heart . <p> Viney regrets getting snippy . She should n't have made a fuss , pushed him like that . It 's one of those men things , a matter of pride , and there 's nothing she can do now to stop him . She watches him slam the trunk closed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could use some new golf shoes . She got him that pair a couple of Christmases ago . It 's not like he has n't gotten good use out of them . <p> A wind kicks up . The bamboo chimes shudder ; the whirly-gig in the rose bed spins madly . Welly starts the car . A cloud of exhaust is instantly dissipated . <p> It 's August ! Viney thinks with sudden clarity . That 's what it is , that explains everything . The Joneses always get owly in late August . Criminy , the whole town does for that matter , it 's not as if what happened to them did n't happen to the rest of us . <p> Welly 's children must be feeling it , too-Bonnie a few blocks away , Larken and Gaelan up in Lincoln . Poor kids . None of them are happy , none of them have ever really settled down . Viney glances at the photographs of Llwellyn and Hope 's children , prominently displayed on the fireplace mantle along with the pictures of her own blood kin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurriedly pushes open the screen door and scurries out to the curb to wave goodbye , but it 's too late . Welly is already turning the car onto Bridge Street . He does n't see her . <p> Viney sighs . That man does love to whack things with a stick . Funny . He 's not even very good at it . <p> She gives an assessing look to the accumulating clouds off to the southwest , checks the thermometer on the garage , and sniffs the air . The wind is high now , and cooling . The thick humid air that 's hovered over town for the past few days is being pushed aside . <p> Viney goes in . She changes into footless tights and a leotard . She 'll do her exercise video and then figure out something for dinner . <p> Maybe he 'll get to the club and run into Alan or Glen . They 'll have a drink . That 's probably what he 'll do . He wo n't tee off when it 's sure to storm soon . <p> Viney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pushes the play button . <p> While the FBI reminds her of the penalties associated with video piracy , she unrolls her mat , sits down in lotus , and closes her eyes . <p> It 's Friday . They 'll have frozen lemon pepper filets and that new Stauffer 's Teriyaki Rice and Vegetables . She 'll whip up a salad from Dr. Walker 's cookbook . She 'll make a fresh lime and celery juice tonic and mix it with spring water . <p> The music begins . The steady , sangfroid voice of the yoga instructor encourages her to relax , relax . Breathe . <p> And for dessert , they 'll have big dishes of that Fat-Free Rocky Road that Welly likes so much . <p> The living are n't the only ones unsettled . The dead-especially the fathers-are also perturbed by the mayor 's behavior . <p> There he goes , they 're thinking : kicking up dust with that gas guzzler he drives , hell-bent to engage in his favorite form of outdoor recreation , putting himself in the path of what any fool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worst possible hour of the day . <p> Idiot . <p> The dead fathers of Emlyn Springs are obstinate homebodies . They value routine . They keep close to their caskets . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
