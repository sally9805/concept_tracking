<p> Loud , dirty , and dangerous , personal watercraft are the latest motorized use to invade the parks . While superintendents grapple with the craft on a park-by-park basis , many believe that a comprehensive , systemwide policy is needed before the machines become entrenched . <p> ON A RECENT MORNING , personal watercraft ( water motorcycles , popularly known by the brand name Jet Ski ) clustered in the shallows of Lake Mohave at Lake Mead National Recreation Area in Nevada . Zigzagging parallel to the shoreline , " doing doughnuts , " and jumping wakes , exhibitionist operators showcased their stunts for uninterested sunbathers . While operators flouted a 5-mph speed limit in effect near shore , their craft emitted chainsaw-like buzzing and acrid exhaust . <p> Once unknown to park system waters , such scenes have become increasingly common since 1988 , when easy-to-handle , relatively cheap personal watercraft ( PWC ) models , which average about $5,700 each , began luring people out onto the water in unprecedented numbers . With about 200,000 PWCs sold annually , these machines represent the fastest growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Park Service ( NPS ) does not formally track PWCs operating within its jurisdiction , evidence abounds of their popularity . Rangers estimate that the number of craft has increased by about 30 percent at Olympic National Park in Washington since 1993 and nearly doubled at Lake Mead from 1993 to 1994 . <p> Currently , PWCs can be found in 36 park units , 27 of which report problems of some kind , including speeding and harassing park wildlife . <p> " These are fast , quick craft that have little to do with the appreciation of a national park , " says Phil Pearl , NPCA 's Pacific Northwest regional director . " They are thrill vehicles , that 's how Hawaii defines them , and it 's why they are facing restrictions in other states , and why Switzerland banned them . " <p> Pearl maintains that NPS has the authority to ban PWCs outright and should do so , but so far , restrictions have come on a park-by-park basis , with individual superintendents determining the fate of PWCs . At Glacier National Park in Montana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general management plan is under consideration . But at Olympic National Park in Washington , officials are considering a designated zone for PWC use on Lake Crescent . Loud and Dirty <p> Besides the fact that PWCs have little to do with the appreciation of national parks , at least three other characteristics make them inappropriate . They are dirty , noisy , and unsafe . Running today 's typical model for one hour releases about the same amount of smog-generating pollutants as driving a car 800 miles . New Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) exhaust limits will incrementally be incorporated into new models over the next ten years . But slow fleet turnover will hamper these controls in achieving their projected 70 percent reduction in air pollution before 2051 . <p> Moreover , EPA has yet to address the discharge by PWCs of up to 30 percent of their unburned fuel into the water . This , despite Michigan State University research indicating that the toxicity of such discharges , made 50,000 times worse by ultraviolet light , damages ecologically essential plankton ; and University of Stockholm research demonstrating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment . " <p> Dr. Russell Long , director of the Earth Island Institute 's Blue Water Network , says that EPA dismisses such incriminating research " out of hand , " because of an inappropriate concern for controlling costs for manufacturers  --  despite the successful marketing in Europe of machines that are 80 percent cleaner than those sold in this country . Cleaner machines use fuel-injection engines ; only about 600 of the 1.2 million PWCs in the United States use this system . The remainder use the dirtier , noisier two-stroke engines . <p> Each PWC emits about 80 decibels of noise  --  the equivalent of that emanating from a running vacuum cleaner . Like other powerboats , PWCs barely meet lenient Park Service noise limits , which are 82 decibels at 82 feet . But when operators repeatedly rev and decelerate the machines during typical antics  --  with frequent changes in loudness and pitch  --  the cacophony becomes chaotic and disruptive . <p> Studies conducted by Jim Rodgers , wildlife biologist for the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission , prove what rangers anecdotally report : Noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than does that from other boats . Rodgers suspects that such dispersal , which may force nesting birds to abandon eggs at crucial times and reduce mating and feeding , is exacerbated by the boats ' spray , which spews much farther than that of other powerboats . Rangers also report that PWCs destroy plants when they go into shallow water-and the record contains many cases of operators intentionally harassing birds , seals , and other creatures . Water Hazards <p> Impacts of PWCs are compounded when operators form what one wildlife biologist calls " packs , " which are unique to these craft . As many as 15 PWCs may relentlessly circle landmarks , such as otherwise inaccessible islands . <p> Ironically , scientists also warn that personal watercraft , whose engines work without the noisy propellers of other powerboats , may be so quiet underwater that they fail to sound subsurface warnings as they quickly and unpredictably zigzag , posing collision hazards for unsuspecting surfacing whales and dolphins as well as slow-moving Florida manatees , which tend to linger near the surface . <p> PWCs pose hazards not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While these craft currently represent about 10 percent of the nation 's recreational boats , they account for 30 to 50 percent of the accidents . In 1995 , the nation 's PWC operators were involved in 3,700 accidents , including many within national parks . Among these statistics was a double fatality involving a crash between two personal watercraft on Lake Mead . " Jet Skiers turn on a dime , often forgetting that another is behind them , " says Coast Guard statistician Bruce Schmidt . <p> Personal watercraft can take hairpin turns at 60 mph and zoom through water only two feet deep , yet their braking power remains limited . And although PWCs can be catapulted from waves like water-to-air missiles , they can not be steered during re-entry into the water . Moreover , several states that contain national park sites , including Utah and Colorado , either have no minimum age requirements , or allow even 1 2-year-olds to operate these vessels , as in California and Minnesota . Intrinsically Inappropriate <p> But even if PWCs were safe and environmentally friendly , the sanctity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Pearl . Why ? Because national parks were created to protect and foster appreciation for natural resources , not to provide playgrounds for motorized equipment . <p> And while other types of boaters usually enjoy additional activities , such as fishing and sightseeing , personal watercraft users usually focus myopically on joyriding without regard for their surroundings . <p> " No one group of users should be allowed to destroy the peace and tranquillity that the majority of park visitors have come to enjoy , " says Pearl . " PWCs are inappropriate for places whose mission is to protect natural , cultural , and wilderness values . There are plenty of alternative places to use these machines . " <p> Supporting Pearl 's position is a 1995 survey sponsored by NPCA and conducted by Colorado State University , which shows that more than 70 percent of U.S. citizens consider " peace and quiet " important features of national parks . The Snowmobile Precedent <p> NPS has just begun to grapple with the problem of PWCs , but the dangers of surrendering to proliferating motorized craft have already been exposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catering to local concessioners , the Park Service did not restrain snowmobiles when they first appeared in the park during the mid-1970s . Now during a typical winter , Yellowstone hosts up to 1,500 snowmobiles daily , many more than anticipated . <p> Their sallow exhausts taint the sky , and the whine of two-stroke engines shatters the quiet . Additionally , bison frequently follow snowmobile trails out of the park in search of food . This year , following a particularly severe winter . more than 1,000 bison were shot or slaughtered because of fears in Montana that the animals would spread brucellosis , a disease that causes cattle to abort . See Forum , page 43 . " Snowmobiles in Yellowstone were not well thought out in the beginning , " concedes Mike Murray , the park 's assistant chief ranger . <p> Pearl says a similar problem could arise with PWCs if decisive action is not taken soon . " Wait 20 years , when PWCs are faster ... and there are more of them , " he warns . Without strict controls , " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Uniform Policy Needed <p> Increasingly , park managers are either considering or have implemented bans on PWCs . In 1989 , Everglades National Park conducted a study on PWCs that recommended banning the machines throughout the park system . Everglades , along with Dry Tortugas , Virgin Islands , and Yellowstone national parks , banned personal watercraft during the late 1980s and early 1990s . Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming banned them on two of three lakes . <p> Biscayne National Park in Florida now restricts PWCs from some areas throughout the Columbus Day weekend , when an annual sail regatta has traditionally drawn a dangerous mix of crowds and alcohol . Recently . concern over personal watercraft prompted Gateway National Recreation Area in New York and New Jersey to bar all powerboats from certain sensitive wetlands . And Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona is increasing enforcement of PWC prohibitions along the canyon 's white-water stretches , and reviewing possible restrictions within the park 's lake zone . <p> Meanwhile national parks such as Big Bend in Texas , Glacier in Montana , Isle Royale in Michigan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with Lake Mead National Recreation Area , and national seashores including Point Reyes in California and Cape Cod in Massachusetts , are considering controls or bans of PWCs . <p> But Pearl believes that what 's missing is a standard policy . A systemwide review of the emerging problem , says Pearl , would encourage NPS to take early , consistent , and decisive stands on potentially divisive issues . Many park superintendents agree that taking an early stand is better than waiting for a problem to develop . <p> " If you address inappropriate uses ahead of time , you 've got some disgruntled visitors , but that 's all , " explains Voyageurs National Park Superintendent Barbara West . " One of the hardest things for park managers is to stop uses that are already established . " <p> To ensure effective responses to offensive park uses in the future , Pearl advocates overhauls to some National Park Service approaches . He encourages a return to the type of headquarters-based decision-making over critical issues that prevailed before budget cutting and the agency reorganization during the early 1990s reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed local political pressures to rule the day . Progressive Opposition <p> Recently , resistance to controls has become more contentious . PWCs have become the latest hot-button issue in the " Wise Use " movement 's campaign to force the Park Service and other agencies to open up public lands to profit-making enterprises and motorized uses . At Olympic , for example , a hearing on a plan to zone a portion of Lake Crescent for personal watercraft drew two local associations with ties to national " Wise Use " groups . <p> Debate over personal watercraft nearly stalled a seven-month mediation process led by a team charged with developing a new management plan for Voyageurs . Sen. Paul Wellstone ( D-Minn. ) requested the mediation to search for a compromise between conflicting legislative proposals offered by other members of the Minnesota congressional delegation . The mediation board developed a tentative agreement in January , but in February , members of organizations representing motorized interests withdrew their support . <p> At issue is a possible ban on personal watercraft and restrictions on snowmobiles on the park 's Chain of Lakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Kawasaki and Yamaha  --  also make PWCs . <p> Even with strict controls , the dynamic personal watercraft industry warrants vigilance . Wet suits are helping to make PWCs a year-round craft , and new hauling boats are transporting PWCs to remote , offshore points , extending the machines ' reach beyond their fuel range . New three-seater hybrids are making some laws aimed at two-seater models moot . <p> To prevent this in the future , Pearl recommends a PWC definition that uses a power-to-length ratio . A typical powerboat , for instance , has a three-to-one power-to-length ratio , translating to a 50-hp motor on a 16-foot boat . A PWC has a 1 2-to-one power-to-length ratio . <p> Pearl says that NPS should prohibit new types of motorized craft in all of its jurisdictions until their worthiness can be established ; in other words , the burden of proof should be shifted from the opponents to the proponents of such vehicles . <p> " These things are so controversial , why let them into the parks without studying them ? " asks Pearl . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies determine that they are not detrimental , they should be allowed in only those parks where motorized boating use is permitted by the unit 's authorizing legislation . " <p> The number of PWCs nearly doubled at Lake Mead National Recreation Area in Nevada from 1993 to 1994 . <p> Canoeists enjoy Two Medicine Lake in Glacier , where PWCs have been banned pending consideration of a general management plan . <p> BY LILY WHITEMAN <p> <p> LlLY WHITEMAN is an environmental freelance writer based in Washington , D.C. <p>
