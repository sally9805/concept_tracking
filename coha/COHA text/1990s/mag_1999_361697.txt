Internet stocks have defied convention and gravity for the better part of two years . Never mind that to these outfits , profit is mostly a concept . They had cool products , hip clients , catchy names , irreverent ads , promise  --  lots of promise  --  and more . They had panache . They were cocktail chatter , and their stocks ( and stockholders ) were giddy . The money-losing online bookseller Amazon.com long ago blew past venerable Sears in terms of market value . At the time , investors gasped and marveled . They kept buying , but at least they noticed . By April , though , Amazon 's worth was fast approaching that of Sears and Wal-Mart combined , and nobody was paying attention . <P> They are now . Amazon 's April apex , it turns out , was the top of the market for Internet stocks . On average , they have declined 32% , and many , including Amazon , have halved . So , is it time to declare the Internet bubble burst and set the Net stocks next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , computer leasing ( 1970s ) and , yes , tulips ( 1600s ) ? <P> Not so fast . The Net wonders are n't dead . They 're just going to behave differently as this industry , like so many before it , enters the next phase of development . That phase will include the creation of tons of stock as new IPOs flood the market in search of easy money ( yours ) . And it will include the inevitable shakeout as investors sort out the jewels from the junk . The only question is , How fast will all this happen ? <P> Internet analysts , as confused as the rest of us , are riding the fence . They recognize that the recent Internet-stock drop could be just another fake-out  --  " an intrusion of rational thinking , " says one  --  like the dips in January and last autumn . In both cases , patience and faith were rewarded when those stocks roared back from sharp declines . But the pros are n't exactly backing up the truck to get their fill . It 's more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who manages the Firsthand Technology Fund , ventures that this may prove to be a good time to start buying Net stocks if you 've been out of the game  --  and are a long-term investor . So , you 're jumping in with both feet , right , Kevin ? After he stops laughing , Landis says , " We 've just got away from the scary point at which people say , ' I do n't know how to value it , but I have to own it anyway . ' But we 're nowhere near levels where you can start making a value argument . " <P> The new-economy Net stocks are now up against some old-economy fundamentals they have n't faced before . Rising interest rates are a big deal . The 30-year Treasury-bond yield popped over 6% last week , its highest level in more than a year , and could well stay there . Speculative stocks ( and Internet defines the category ) tend to get hard hit when higher rates threaten to slow the economy and the market . There are also basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &T; shut it out of cable access ? ) and Amazon ( Can it reverse slowing revenue growth ? ) .
