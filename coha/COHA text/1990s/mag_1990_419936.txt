Many aquatic plants will flourish in a small tub or trough <p> In 1878 WATERLILIES grown in tubs excited a great deal of attention when Harvard University landscapers first displayed them on the main lawn of the campus . Today similar displays are found in the yards of amateur and accomplished water gardeners , sporting everything from interesting aquatic plants to the most precious of waterlilies . Yet such small-scale water gardens are well within the reach of any gardener seeking a versatile , attractive , and surprisingly easy project . If you would like to give water gardening a try before digging a pool , or if your space is limited to a deck , patio , or terrace balcony , you 'll find that growing plants in a container is simple , fun , and rewarding . <p> Probably the largest water plant you will want to raise in a container is a waterlily . Waterlilies have certain minimum space requirements that dictate the size of the container you choose . Many will survive and flower when planted in a five-inch pot , but the pot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant will also need at least two feet to stretch its foliage across the water 's surface . If you wish to include bog plants and oxygenating plants ( to help control algae ) , you 'll have to allow enough room for their needs as well . <p> Tubs , troughs , and old sinks have been used for miniature water gardens , and water-garden suppliers now offer a variety of suitable containers . A perennial favorite , and always an excellent choice for a display , is the half whiskey barrel found at any garden center or building-supply store . However , toxins in the wood  --  even after several cleanings  --  may foul the water , soil , and plants . Some water gardeners seal " the inside of the barrel with a fiberglass-based glaze ( available at craft and hobby shops ) , but the glaze has been from the side of the known to separate barrel . The easiest and least expensive solution is to use durable plastic see " How to Line Half-Barrel , " on page 21 , for instructions . <p> Choose a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ container with water and plants . Selecting the right spot will eliminate the need to empty the container and reposition it later . Pay attention to how much sunshine is available . Waterlilies love sun  --  the more the better . Do n't be afraid , however to try a display in filtered sun ; some waterlilies adapt to less-than-full sun . Plant Selection <p> ( Waterlilies come in a wide assortment of colors , some which are particularly adaptable to small containers . If a waterlily starts to outgrow its space , you can restrain it by periodically removing its outer ( older ) leaves . <p> While there are exceptions to every rule , hardy waterlilies ( whose blooms rest on the surface of the water ) tend to perform better in cooler climates , while tropical waterlilies ( whose blooms rise above the surface of the water ) generally do better in warmer climates . A particularly striking choice is the " changeable " or " sunset " hardy waterlilies ; their flowers change color each clay as they darken with age . <p> Many bog plants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and attain sizes in keeping with a miniature garden . To keep your display interesting , choose plants with contrasting forms , such as upright-growing plants and spreading plants . <p> A small water garden ought to include an oxygenating plant . These plants produce oxygen and absorb nutrients through their underwater leaves and stems , leaving algae little opportunity to develop . Parrot's-feather ( Myriophyllum aquaticum ) , awl-leaf arrowhead ( Sagittaria subulata ) , and waterweed ( Elodea ) are all good choices . <p> You might also add several handfuls floating plants . These do not need to be potted in soil , as they are able to absorb nutrients directly from the water . Floating plants quickly cover the water 's surface , helping to control algae by blocking the sun . Duckweed ( Lemna ) , water fern ( Azolla ) , water lettuce ( Pirtia stratiotes ) , and water hyacinth ( Eichhornia crassipes ) are all good choices . Floating plants are often aggressive growers , however , so you may have to keep their numbers under control . Many are noxious weeds in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure they stay confined to the container . <p> All of these plants grow well together , so feel free to experiment with different combinations . A half-barrel garden can comfortably hold a waterlily , one or two bog plants , and an oxygenating plant . In smaller containers , you may have to omit the waterlily . Proper Planting <p> Waterlilies require warm water to grow and produce blooms . Fortunately , water confined to a small container warms up quickly . It is safe to plant most tropical waterlilies , bog plants , oxygenating plants , and floating plants when the water temperature remains over 70 degrees Fahrenheit . Hardy waterlilies and hardy bog plants can be planted at almost any time , although planting them when water temperatures remain above 55 degrees is best . <p> Never plant a waterlily or other water-garden plant in potting soil ; always use a heavy garden loam . Clay loam from the vegetable garden is excellent for this purpose , although topsoil will do as well . In any event , the soil should be dark in color and exhibit a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become dislodged . Do not add sand or peat moss  --  sand offers no benefits to the plants , and peat moss breaks away from soil and floats in the water . <p> Although some water plants can get away with more cramped conditions , a good pot size for many is a #2 nursery can ( eight inches deep by eight inches wide ) . Four of these will fit on the floor of a half-barrel garden . Bear in mind that most waterlilies like to be at least five inches underwater , while many bog plants can be submerged as little as two inches . Those that need to be closer to the surface can be elevated on bricks or overturned containers . <p> Fertilize the plants at planting time . A low-analysis ( 5-10-5 , 6-10-4 ) granular fertilizer is fine ; use one ounce per eight quarts of soil . Mix it into the soil first . If you prefer to use the fertilizer tablets sold by water-garden suppliers , fill each pot halfway with soil and set the plant in , then add the tablet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , use the tablets at the rate recommended by the supplier . Differences in soil , climate , and plants might dictate later changes in your fertilizing regimen . <p> In any event , firm the soil around the plant to avoid air pockets . To prevent the water from muddying , top off each pot with a half-inch of sand or pea gravel to hold the soil in place . Also , unless you have memorized the names of your plants , you may wish to insert labels in each pot . At this point , you can further eliminate air pockets by thoroughly soaking the plant in its pot ( and waiting for the water to drain out ) . Finally , slowly lower each plant into the container at an angle to allow air to escape and to prevent the plant from breaking away from the soil . <p> Add any floating plants after the potted ones are in place . A small number of floating plants will soon multiply to cover the water 's surface . Maintaining the Display <p> Maintaining your little water garden will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to resist scrutinizing it daily . A healthy container-grown waterlily produces flowers all summer long . Individual flowers generally last three days before sinking below the water 's surface , at which time they should be pruned away . Occasional pruning of outer leaves and yellowing leaves will also be necessary ; always remove them at the crown so that the remnants do n't stay behind to rot or crowd the environment . <p> Bog plants will require similar tidying , especially as they mature . Oxygenating plants can be rampant growers , so feel free to prune them liberally . <p> Both waterlilies and bog plants should be fertilized regularly . Waterlilies in general benefit from monthly feedings , while bog plants as a rule need about half as much fertilizer as waterlilies . Poke the fertilizer down into tile pot , well into the soil and under the plant 's roots  --  tablets are perhaps the most practical form of fertilizer at this point . <p> It is not uncommon for a newly planted waterlily to lose leaves . Do n't be dismayed . More than likely the plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Growth should resume in two or three weeks . <p> Very few troubles plague a well-planted container garden . Do n't be alarmed if algae develop . Scrape off and discard what algae you can , and be patient . As your oxygenating plants and other plants mature , the algae will gradually abate . Sometimes mosquitoes lay their eggs in water gardens . If this is a problem , try adding mosquito fish ( Gambusia ) to control the larvae . Goldfish are also suitable except in extremely hot climates , where the water in a small container may get too hot for them . Controlling pests by hand is never a big chore . If aphids infest the outer leaves of a waterlily , simply trim off and destroy the affected leaves . Tiny caterpillars caught nibbling on leaves can be handpicked ( do n't forget : to check the undersides of the leaves as well ) . The algicides and pesticides intended for larger water gardens carry their own risks to pool life  --  both animal and plant  --  and these products are in any event excessive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants are in individual pots , you can easily change their positions within the container if you wish . If you decide to change the location of the container itself , simply remove the plants , place them in a shady spot , empty the container , move it to its new location , refill it , set in your plants  --  and you 're back in business . <p> Water lost to evaporation will have to be replaced periodically . Place the hose against the inside of the container to avoid disturbing the plants . <p> You may find your plants a bit more vigorous than you anticipated . Roots emerging from the bottom of a pot can be cut back  --  the plant will survive . Better still , remove the plant , divide it , and repot . Then you will have some extra plants to share with a neighbor or to begin your second water garden . Fall Cleanup <p> When danger of frost approaches , it 's time to prepare the water garden for winter . Unlike a full-size pool , a container will probably freeze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants , hardy and tropical . <p> A hardy waterlily , stripped of its leaves , can be stored in a cool , protected place such as a cellar . Mulch the pot with pine needles or straw , keep it moist , and do not allow the roots to freeze . Hardy bog plants will enter a period of dormancy and can be trimmed back and stored in the same manner . <p> Some water gardeners simply discard tender plants at the end of the growing season , but they too can be saved for next year 's display . Store the tender tubers of tropical waterlilies in moist sand at about 55 degrees ( any warmer , and they may sprout prematurely ) . Bog plants of tropical origin and floating plants will make it through the winter in an aquarium , as long as the water is warm ( between 60 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit ) . They may die back a bit , but they 'll come back to life next year . Do not fertilize the plants during the winter months . <p> If you added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer , they should still be alive . They too can spend the winter inside an aquarium . <p> The container should then be emptied and washed out , as debris and algae may have accumulated on its sides and bottom . In the case of a half-barrel , refill it and leave it outside all winter , as indoor conditions will cause it to dry out and the bands may slip down . Store non-wooden containers out of the weather in the garage or cellar . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Some plants that thrive in a small water garden include the waterlily Chromatella ' , spike rush , floating water lettuce , and trailing parrot's-feather . <p> By Joe Tomocik <p> <p> Joe Tomocik is in charge of the water gardens at Denver Botanic Gardens . <p> HOW TO LINE A HALF-BARREL <p> At 24 inches wide and 18 inches deep , a half-barrel is an excellent choice for a small water garden . When selecting a barrel , do not pick one at random , as all are not alike . Reject those that are cut unevenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling off . And be careful when handling a barrel  --  they are fairly heavy and a bit awkward to move . A sprained back would certainly put a damper on your water-gardening adventure . <p> Begin by soaking and cleaning the barrel . The wood will swell with absorbed water and leak less with each filling ; most barrels hold water to with in several inches of the top after several fillings . Scrub out the barrel with a mild detergent and rinse it thoroughly . Starting out with a clean barrel is simply a sanitary measure ; sometimes they are caked with debris or oils that can be harmful to plants . <p> Once the barrel is clean and in its chosen site , it is ready to be lined with thick plastic . Garbage-can liners are not strong enough for the job . Watergarden suppliers offer polyvinyl chloride ( PVC ) and other durable synthetic materials of varying thickness , from 12 millimeters to 45 millimeters ; these materials have proved suitable for lining garden pools and can give years of excellent service . Building-supply centers , hardware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polyethylene sheeting that can be used to line a barrel . If you choose a material that 's less than 10 millimeters thick , however , you should use two layers to improve the liner 's longevity . <p> As you set out to line your barrel , you 'll need the following materials : a measuring tape , heavy-duty shears , a professional staple gun and 3/8-inch staples , and string . All of these items are available at any building-supply center or hardware store . Find a fiat area to work in , and cut a five-by-five-foot square piece of lining material . Cut it out carefully with the heavy shears , laying the string along the plastic as a guide . Remember to cut two pieces if your material is less than 10 millimeters thick . Place the square liner in the barrel . The center of the liner should coincide with the center of the barrel . This is easily done by jockeying it back and forth until the amount of overlap is the same all the way around . Partially fill the barrel with water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barrel . Now the liner will look something like a cupcake liner . Continue filling the barrel to the top . Trim the liner so that there is only two inches of overlap all the way around the barrel . Pull the liner over the top of the barrel and staple it to the outside approximately an inch from the top . Fold the liner under as you work your way around , stapling every two inches . This prevents water from seeping down between the liner and the barrel . Your barrel is now ready for planting . <p> The portion of the liner that is out of the water is more subject to deterioration from ultraviolet rays . Using a heavy-grade material or doubling the liner gives added protection . A five-foot-square piece of material works well with these instructions ; a somewhat smaller piece would do if you decide you 'd rather staple the top inside the barrel . <p> Over time , the barrel will weather ; many people prefer this look . The metal bands will rust unless you sand them , then coat them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : STEPS ON HOW TO LINE A HALF-BARREL <p> By Joe Tomocik <p> STOCKING THE POND <p> The following are tried-and-true candidates for the container water garden .
