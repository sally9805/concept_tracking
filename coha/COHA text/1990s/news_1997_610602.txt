<p> Come Fridays at noon , D.C. Mayor Marion Barry , the District 's control board , the city 's squabbling politicians , legions of city workers and even some of the District 's overlords on Capitol Hill halt their battles and join in common ritual . They flip on their radios to the " D.C. Politics Hour "  --  a weekly dose of insight and insults about the city that ca n't . <p> When D.C. 's top pols do n't like what they hear , they call in or even drop in at WAMU 's Tenleytown studios , making Derek McGinty and Mark Plotkin 's show a must-listen for District politicos and a unique peek into the city 's inner workings for thousands of listeners , urban and suburban alike . <p> McGinty , midday talk host on WAMU ( 88.5 FM ) and a multimedia star , and Plotkin , an erstwhile city politician turned commentator and schmoozer , make the hour sizzle with an improvised style that 's as reminiscent of Martin and Lewis as it is of Jennings and Brinkley . <p> Plotkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtually see his arms waving about as he rails against the dark forces of the control board and the junta running the city school system . ( Listeners eager to see the arm movements can tune into the rebroadcast on WETA-TV , Channel 26 , Fridays at 11 p.m . ) <p> McGinty , 38 , is the cool one , the voice of reason , concerned for the city of his birth but pragmatic enough to welcome any and all outside help . Some weeks McGinty sounds as if he 'd embrace tanks on every corner if it would balance the budget . <p> " We had some initial testiness and settled into our groove , " says McGinty of the six-year-old show . " Mark is Mark . There are times he goes over the top , but without him , the show would n't be of much interest . " <p> Plotkin returns the compliment . " When the station was looking for a new talk host , I argued against Derek 's employment , " he recalls . " His interest in American politics was less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more than holds his own with the show 's rotating panel of local newspaper and TV reporters . In an era when radio and TV have virtually abandoned serious coverage of local politics , the " Politics Hour " is frenetic in the manner of so many media-age political discussion shows , but it 's not dumb and demeaning like " The McLaughlin Group " or those other TV shout-outs . McGinty , Plotkin and company actually talk policy . They 're the Car Guys of the political chat biz . <p> " Some people call and say the show is not serious enough , " Plotkin says . " I say , ' Hang on , let me get you the number for the Brookings Institution . ' " <p> McGinty has tried to duplicate the D.C. program 's success with a monthly Virginia and Maryland hour , but the suburban edition has n't caught fire . <p> " There 's not enough going on in the suburbs to do it weekly , " he says . " And it does n't have the characters the District has . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give much credit for the show 's success  --  it has about 35,000 listeners , according to Arbitron  --  to the much-maligned mayor . " The reelection of Marion Barry was the Mark Plotkin Full Employment Act , " McGinty cracks . <p> The only caveat to issue about the " Politics Hour "  --  and the other nine hours a week when McGinty 's smart , no-nonsense interviews grace WAMU 's airwaves  --  is that McGinty may not be long for our radios . <p> Yes , that was McGinty hosting a talk show on PBS the other night . And yes , that 's McGinty reporting on Bryant Gumbel 's new CBS-TV newsmagazine . And that smooth , jovial voice handling the anchor honors on NPR 's " All Things Considered " this summer  --  yep , McGinty . <p> McGinty has had offers or discussions with every major TV network , but says he 's waiting for the perfect job . " I like what I do here , and I know I wo n't have as much control over what I do anywhere else , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us when we have to see what else we can accomplish . " <p> Although McGinty was the standout in this summer 's series of substitute hosts on " All Things Considered , " he says he 's too wedded to live interviewing to chain himself to an anchor desk . <p> And he admits that TV beckons  --  the national reach , the network resources , the cash . " We ca n't forget that , " he says , chuckling . " I 'd be lying if I said otherwise . " He 'll report occasional stories for Gumbel 's " Public Eye , " telling tales " that reflect larger societal problems . " And his quarterly PBS talk shows will continue . <p> " I do n't know what Derek 's future will be , " says Steve Martin , WAMU 's program director . " He is very committed to the daily talk show , but obviously he ca n't say no to some of these very lucrative offers . There 's not a whole lot we can do about that . We just have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bites <p> Gospel 's heyday : Washington 's ninth Christian radio station  --  and the area 's third all-gospel outlet  --  signed on last week at 1030 on the AM dial . WWGB  --  the new call letters stand for Washington Gospel Broadcast  --  will go up against WYCB-AM ( 1340 ) and WPGC-AM ( 1580 ) in the burgeoning black Christian broadcasting field . <p> The idea of this market supporting three gospel stations may seem a stretch , but WWGB 's owner , Mortenson Broadcasting , believes it can find a niche . " We 're playing the Word to help people correct their lives , " says WWGB General Manager Carl DeShazior . The station , based in Suitland , broadcasts sunrise to sunset on the old WINX frequency , which has been silent in recent months . <p> Aiming at a 35-and-up audience , WWGB will steer clear of the rousing , Kirk Franklin-style music that is the heart of WPGC 's offering . Instead , WWGB will play mostly traditional gospel , including daily concerts from 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m . <p> The new station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sumner  --  the only WDCU program that thus far has found life after the station 's demise . The show will air Sunday mornings from 6 to 11 . <p> More hip-hop , less pop : WPGC-FM ( 95.5 ) , for many years the most popular station in town , has seen its ratings slip during the past year , hit hard both by Z-104 's Top 40 format and by the new No. 1 , black hits WKYS-FM ( 93.9 ) . Now the CBS-owned giant is fighting back , edging away from its coy attitude of " We play black music , but we 're not a black station , " and adopting a harder , more street-based sound . <p> " Representing hip-hop and R &B"; is the station 's new slogan , and last week , PGC removed longtime midday deejay Christina Kelley . It 's the latest in a series of moves to create a younger , blacker sound . Station managers could not be reached for comment . <p> " I 'm black , but I do n't have that black sound , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who hopes to remain in the Washington area . No replacement has been named . <p> New Country : Thunder 107.7 , the Manassas-based country station , last week became WUPP , UpCountry 107.7 . The new format is an attempt to distinguish the suburban station from the big city country sound of WMZQ-FM ( 98.7 ) . The new sound promises to include no ballads , no soft pop and far fewer new songs . <p> " Nashville is not releasing the quality of product it had in the early- to mid- ' 90s , " says Mark Lapidus , the consultant who created the new sound . WUPP will target 18- to 44-year-olds , with a male leaning . <p> Country stations generally are in a sagging period , and Thunder was no exception . <p> In other country news , WMZQ ( 98.7 ) morning show hosts Gary Murphy and Jessica Cash will be on CBS-TV
