Section : THE Pastel PAGE <p> It took many years of working with a variety of surface before I finally discovered the warmth and textural beauty of linen canvas . An ideal ground for pastels , the soft-woven surface of linen is perfect for portraits , landscapes , still lifes , and figurative i paintings  --  even for the image on my annual Christmas card . As with any material , it requires practice to maximize its potential . <p> Although there are many linen canvases to choose , I prefer Fredrix 's No. 1088 Galactica . Because I work on the unprimed ; side of the canvas , I personally inspect each roll to see if any white primer has leaked from the primed side . <p> Back in my studio , I securely tack the canvas on the wall and arrange my pastels across two large , flat drawing tables . I usually work with hard Nupastels and several soft pastels made by Sennelier , Unison , and Holbein . <p> With a pencil and tracing paper , I then determine a precise c design and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While this may seem like an idle exercise , it allows me to approach the canvas with a sense of the finished painting in mind , so I can concentrate on the aesthetics of my work . <p> Once I decide on the appropriate size and composition for the painting , I mask off the specific area on the canvas and start drawing with a sharpened piece of Conte crayon #2450 . Then I lightly spray the drawing with a workable fixative . ( I use fixative sparingly throughout the painting process . ) <p> At this point , an intuitive choice of color comes into play . Complementary colors are an important facet of my technique . I start conservatively with mostly neutral tones and gold ochres , olive greens , and timbers , blocking in areas softly and boldly , keeping everything loose and unstructured without concentrating on any specific area . While working over the entire canvas , I sometimes use a Conte crayon to reestablish certain sections of the original drawing . <p> Once the neutrals and a few of the complementary colors have been roughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject and background , making sure the colors interact with and against each other . Depending on how I feel about a particular area of the painting , I run strokes in random directions using the blunt end of the pastel stick . For example , as I near completion of a portrait , I follow the form of the subject 's arm with my strokes . With neutral underlying strokes running in the opposite direction , the breakup of different colors generates texture and form . <p> I believe in using high-key colors that relate to the overall painting . For instance , a blouse can appear white by using a particular combination of colors , such as high-key blues , pinks , and yellows . Other than for the highlight in the eyes , I never use white in a portrait . If a color is too intense , I tone it down by overstroking it with neutrals . Accents of color can have a dazzling effect on the overall appearance of a painting . <p> I often leave portions of the canvas exposed . The beauty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrasts and heightens other colors . I use colors in the background of my portraits to enhance the subject and overall ambiance of the painting . <p> Upon completion , I spray the painting lightly with Lascaux fixative . As a final step , I affix the canvas to a piece of 3/16 " Gator Board that has been previously cut to size . To ensure complete adhesion to the board , I place the painting facedown on a piece of clean paper and spray the primed side of the canvas with 3M 's Super 77 Spray . Next , I set it faceup on the sized Gator Board , cover the painting surface with a clean sheet of paper , and place it faceup in a vacuum press for five to six minutes . I then trim the mounted painting , leaving a 1/2 " border on all sides . <p> Before framing , I photograph the painting for my portfolio . Because I consider my pastels paintings , not drawings , I generally prefer an inner liner to a mat for my work . Therefore , I frame them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them under glass . The glass must be separated from the painting by a small invisible strip . TIPS FOR USING PASTELS ON LINEN CANVAS Working the canvas too vigorously will result in small nubs , much like those found on the sleeves of a well-worn sweater . However , the same electric fuzz buster that works OH a sweater can be used on a canvas to remove these nubs  --  and it wo n't disturb your painting . If you want to make a major correction , a small shop vacuum will remove the pastel from the canvas and eliminate pastel dust floating in the air . In the early stages of a portrait , I establish the highlight in the eyes with a white pastel . Once the portrait is finished , I touch in the final highlight using a fine-pointed brush and white casein . DEMONSTRATION : PORTRAIT OF SARAH <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Step 1 . First , I measured the canvas to the desired size and taped the edges with masking tape . Then drew the subject with a sharpened Conte #2450 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Step 2 . At this stage , I stroked neutrals in and around the face , using timbers , earthy greens , and ochres , both warm and cool . I tested colors in the blouse ( pinks , golds , and greens ) to see what felt right for that part of the painting . I placed darks in the background for contrast with the girl 's face and shoulders . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Step 3 . At this point , the painting began to take on the likeness of the subject . I added more ochres and warm yellow reds as well as cool timbers to the face and established a more refined finish to the eyes with highlights . I also added lights and darks to the hair . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Step 4 . Here I decided the blouse would be a blue color with an underpainting of warm yellow , oranges , and cool magentas . More darks were added to the background . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Step 5 . I added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the cheek and chin , and final lights in the hair . Notice how the colors from the earlier stages still remain in the background . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The completed painting : Portrait of Sarah , 1993 , pastel on linen , 24 x 19 .
