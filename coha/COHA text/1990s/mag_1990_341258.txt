One of the world 's most powerful Germans lives in Rome . Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger , 63 , is prefect of the Vatican 's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , and thus guardian of church orthodoxy for 900 million Roman Catholics . It is said that Pope John Paul II makes no important decisions without consulting Ratzinger , who was born in Marktl am Inn , Bavaria .
