PRIMARY RACES , ESPECIALLY the early ones , look so earnest and earthy it is easy to mistake them for truly democratic exercises . When Pat Buchanan walked away with New Hampshire last week , he took pleasure in arguing that The People had found their voice , jostled the conventional wisdom , spooked the party elders and voted their hearts . <P> That helps explain why a lot of Republicans decided long ago that too much democracy is a dangerous thing when it comes to nominating a President . In the next four weeks the game of presidential politics turns very serious , very unforgiving and very unpopulist . It 's affirmative action for party elders ; if a rebel like Buchanan wants to be President , he could do twice as well as anyone else and find that even that might not be enough . <P> The reason for this is that the process  --  the calendar , the rules , the role of the Governors  --  is intended to favor the candidate sanctioned by the party . If all goes according to plan , Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing so far has gone as planned , and party lawyers can imagine a scene like this : a fractured convention , with clumps of delegates nominally pledged each to Dole , Lamar Alexander , Pat Buchanan and Steve Forbes ; more than half the delegates not legally bound to any candidate at all under various state rules ; no clear sign of a nominee ; the vice presidency up in the air ; 20 or so Republican Governors pining for it ; and open warfare between the centrists and the 30% or so of delegates who are conservative Christians . All turning in the widening gyre of television and a computer age . " I think it could be the best race of the century in terms of a nomination fight , " says G.O.P. consultant Paul Wilson . " And we get to watch it . " <P> Of course , this is the kind of chaos the party meant to stamp out . By any traditional reckoning , it was going to be over by the end of March , when 66% of the delegates are technically chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was designed to slingshot an early front runner into inevitability . Now it may not even save one from ignominy . Dole alone has raised the money for the ads and traveling necessary in a multifront war . He has $6.4 million cash on hand ( although he is bumping up against the primary season 's legal spending limit ) ; Buchanan and Alexander have roughly $1 million each . <P> But oddly enough , money may not be paramount in a field where four or five candidates insist on dividing the anti-Pat vote . That 's because the rules for selecting delegates are different in the primary states that come later in the race . Until now , the primary calendar has been an almost quaint exercise in good government . Almost all the delegates apportioned so far have been handed out fair and square , one man , one vote  --  the candidate with 30% of the vote got about 30% of the delegates .
