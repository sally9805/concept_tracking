CONCEPT VEHICLES ARE splashy , high-tech prototypes rolled out by manufacturers for car shows . The futuristic styling  --  usually the result of taking the " what if ... " concept to the nth degree  --  often impresses an audience by its sheer audacity . These visionary vehicles certainly are fun to look at , but they 're hardly practical . FIELD &; STREAM 's concept vehicle is more down to earth . During the past year , we 've taken an existing truck  --  a compact 4x4 pickup  --  and modified it to be more useful to the average hunter and fisherman . Since pickup trucks often see double duty as commuter and work vehicles , our design needed to be flexible enough to accommodate both the outdoor and the working worlds . That meant adding only bolt-on accessories , any of which could be removed with a minimum of fuss . ( For more detailed information on the Chevrolet S-10 MaxiCab 4x4 pickup , see the April 1991 issue ; for more information on the bolt-on accessories , see the November 1991 issue . ) Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a custom-built storage deck for the cargo bed . To get a functional , easy-to-build unit , we consulted with experienced woodworker John Decker . Our charge to him : develop a storage system that allows easy access yet provides secure storage . His response : " There are many ways to go ; the most important is not to overbuild . You do n't want to outsmart yourself . " When he delivered the prototype , he said , " I 'm used to building furniture . You make it hold the things you want in the space you have . It rarely moves , unless you 're going to clean under it . Contrast that with a set of removable storage cabinets that must sustain the rigors of offroad driving and also fit in the bed of a compact truck , and you 've got an interesting challenge . " First , the truck is n't built with the idea of installing storage cabinets . I had to design around the wheel wells , the tight-lock clamps these hold the cap in place , and the fuel filler pipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole thing could be held in place without drilling any holes in the truck in keeping with the philosophy of bolt-on additions . " Actually , that worked out pretty well . The side cabinets are held fore and aft by the wheel wells and the tight-lock clamps . Sliding the gun cabinet in between the two side cabinets locked everything in place like a large wooden puzzle . In addition , a pair of stove bolts fasten the side cabinets to the center gun cabinet . Nothing is going to move . " The centerpiece of the finished deck is the locking two-drawer gun cabinet . Here 's how it works : lower the tailgate , unlock the cabinet lid , and pull up lightly on the lid . The internal gas strut ( a pistonlike device ) then takes over , raising the lid for you . The strut also holds the lid up so you can attend to the guns with both hands . With the lid up , pull the sliding drawers out and remove the cased guns . The sliding drawers not only ease stowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from road shocks . Since the drawers are suspended above the pickup bed , the guns are insulated from most jolts caused by ruts and bumps . The tailgate cabinets on each side of the gun cabinet feature top lids and side doors , doubling access . The doors open only after the tailgate is lowered , and the lids lock with a wooden pivot . The shelf in each tailgate compartment rests on adjustable brackets ; that way , you can alter the shelf height to suit your needs . The middle storage areas adjacent to the tailgate cabinets are shallow reservoirs with lids that lie over the wheel wells . The forward cabinets are deeper ( they 're in front of the wheel wells ) , but harder to reach . Each has a lid also . The best way to determine which gear goes where is to use a form of triage : the more an item is used , the closer to the tailgate it should be . In this way , the tailgate storage is for high-priority items needed over the course of a day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other small items such as insect repellent , calls , and first-aid kits can be stored here also . The middle compartments are ideal for boots , camo clothes , daypacks , etc . Because the forward pair of cabinets is difficult to reach , they should hold infrequently used items such as tire chains , flares , battery cables , winch accessories , emergency tools , etc . Between the forward portion of the gun cabinet and the cab wall is a 6-inch-deep storage area . With the lid removed , the space will hold a large ice chest next to the sliding rear window ; that way your partner can reach through the window to get a cold soda or cold cuts for lunch . The well keeps the chest from sliding around . This storage area also can be used to stow other seldom-used items . Though most owners of stretched-cab compact pickups do n't plan on sleeping in the 6-foot-long cargo bed , the gun cabinet is strong enough to support you if you need to spend the night under the cap . That means it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . The project does n't require a lot of exotic tools . A table or hand-held circular saw , drill , screw gun , and router are the major power tools ; the usual assortment of hand tools  --  hammer , screwdrivers , chisels , tape measure , etc.  --  round out the equipment list . " Building the cabinets was pretty straightforward , " Decker says . " I dadoed the joints in the side cabinets and applied carpenter 's glue before screwing them together . I recessed the screws that showed , then plugged them with 3/8-inch diameter wood plugs . The lids on top of the side cabinets are mounted with mortised butt hinges . I was going to use fully hidden European-style hinges , but they cost too much and require special tools . The rearward doors are mounted on piano hinges . " The gun cabinet is glued and screwed together without dadoes . Half-inch plywood forms the base of the cabinet . I used 3/4-inch plywood on top so it would be strong enough to support heavy loads . " I bought the gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local auto parts store . Most were way too stiff for the lightweight lid . I pressed down on each one to check resistance and found that most did n't budge . I bought the one with the least resistance . " The visible portions of the cabinet are finished with satin polyurethane . I brushed on the first two coats , let them dry , and then fine-sanded the finish before spraying the final coat . I finished the insides of the cabinets with a single coat of polyurethane . " To make the unit look nice , I used cherry plywood . But at nearly $90 per sheet , that 's an expensive option . You can build the whole thing out of construction-grade plywood for considerably less . A nice compromise would be birch plywood , which costs about half that of cherry plywood . At $2.90 a board foot , the solid cherry doors were expensive , but I felt it was important to make the doors solid so I could round all the exposed corners and rout out the recessed door pulls . " The project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabinets on sawhorses in my driveway . The advantage was I did n't have to keep going up and down the basement steps all the time as I fit the cabinets exactly into the truck . The disadvantage was that my work was open to the scrutiny of my neighbors  --  but this turned out to be an advantage , as many neighbors offered valuable observations . For example , my bowhunting neighbor said he could modify the basic design to accommodate his compound bow . Instead of two gun drawers , he 'd build one long one ( eliminating the rear storage area ) for his compound bow . He 'd use the middle cabinet over the wheel wells to store his arrows . And a fishing buddy suggested I make one long top lid ( rather than three ) so fishing rods could be clipped to the underside . " Use the plans ( on page 49 ) as a guide . ( Plans omitted ) Though the plans were developed around the S-10 , you can modify the basic design to fit any pickup truck . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fishing needs . CONSTRUCTION COSTS * Hardware and fasteners ( includes drawer slides , gas strut , screws , and miscellaneous items such as sandpaper and finish , etc. ) cost $170 . The wood cost $345 , mainly because we used more expensive cherry plywood as well as solid cherry . You should be able to reduce the cost of the wood by two-thirds by substituting construction-grade plywood for the cherry plywood . Doing so would bring the total cost down to about $315 .
