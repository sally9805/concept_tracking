Tina Turner bounds up the steps of her manager 's suburban Los Angeles home with the energy of a schoolgirl , running in pointy-toed black-suede heels , pumping those amazing legs with practiced precision . The wig she is wearing today is strawberry blonde , cut short in a shag . Her loose white blouse is sheer , showing a white lace bra underneath cupping perfect breasts that still point to the sun . The jeans are skintight , with those deliberate rips designed to make the new look old and torn , a bit wild and ragged . What other 53-year-old could pull this off ? At once punk and suburban matron , sexy and pure , basic and classy , Tina Turner has always managed to contradict our expectations . I admit I 'm expecting someone other than this gracious woman who is somewhat prim and properly making tea in the kitchen of her manager 's hillside Sherman Oaks home . Where 's the raunchy , bawdy , soul-belting singer of my teenage youth ? The better half of that Ike and Tina Turner Revne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blues ? That performer , as we knew her , is dead and gone . Resurrected in her place is the timeless Tina Turner , recharged and reinvented , a soul survivor who proves every day that living well is still the best revenge . It 's been nearly ten years since Tina Turner shot back onto the charts like a flaming meteor with her stunning 1984 solo album , Private Dancer , which earned her three Grammy Awards and a brand-new generation of fans . Incredibly , the hit single from the album " What 's Love Got to Do With It ? " was the first number-one song Tina Turner-had had in an extraordinary career that has spanned more than 30 years and been , alternately , in the words of the songs she herself made immortal , " river deep " and " mountain high . " The story of Tina Turner 's remarkable life is being brought to the big screen this month in the motion picture What 's Love Got to Do With It ? She is also rehearsing a sound track of the film with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the autobiography I , Tina : My Story , the film documents her stormy marriage to the man who first made her famous , Ike Turner . " Of course I 'm honored , " Tina says . " I 'm thrilled that someone thinks my life is interesting enough to make into a movie . Usually that comes much later . After you 're dead . But at least I 'm here and can defend myself . " She laughs a deep , throaty laugh , easy and confident . Tina Turner is in many ways a woman beyond defending . Her saga has become by now a well-known cautionary tale of love and hate , sex and violence suffered in an abusive marriage . The screen version stars Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne and has a running time of about two hours . That 's not a whole lot of time to tell the complex and complicated story of the girl from Nuthbush , Tenessee , named Anna Mae Bullock and the man who became her Svengali and husband . " How can you put 16 years into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have preferred the story 's being told on the smaller screen , with the longer running time of the TV miniseries . Then she quickly adds , " It could be fantastic , so I 'm not going to say anything bad about the movie . The message I want to have come from it is that I was strong a woman . I was n't just a battered woman . " Indeed , Tina Turner has never fit neatly into either stereotype or fantasy . She is as honest as she is gutsy , and just as she refuses to be a victim , neither does she waste a lot of time assigning blame or looking back . " I 'm not worried about anything from the past , " she notes . " Clearing the inside is what makes dreams come true . " Tina likes to say she is " just a country girl from Nutbush who had a dream . " But when she emerged on the music scene in the early sixties , she also had an act that would seduce a generation . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardest-working performers in show business . Pumping and pulsating across the stage in swinging wigs , spike heels and slinky minis , she and her backup singers , the Ikettes , crafted by the crafty Ike Turner , were the rock-and-soul singers whose very style and stance spelled s-e-x . Yet Tina Turner , the performer who exudes pure sexuality onstage , is not at all comfortable with the sex-image persona . " It 's not something I 've been proud of  --  having sexuality as an image  --  because mine usually gets associated with raunchy , " she explains . " And it 's based solely on what people see when I 'm onstage . Even I have thought , God , look at the picture . What else can you think when you can look up from the audience and see someone 's crotch ? " Tina , however , has learned to accept the image . " I realized I would have to accept it and let it pass because I know how I feel about myself . My performance is sexual if you want to see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some see it as athletic . For me , it 's just fun . I 've always danced with a lot of energy  --  that 's just how I am . If I 'm singing " Hot Legs , " then I 'm going to have hot legs . If I 'm singing " Honky Tonk Women , " then I 'm going to be a honky-tonk woman . I like to give the people something visual , but it 's an act  --  the other side of Anna Mae Bullock . I like to play . But I do n't see myself as sexy . Dorothy Dandridge was very curvy and beautiful and sexy  --  I 'm not at all like that . " Her fans , of course , do not agree . At 53 , Tina Turner has the toned , taut body of a 25-year-old . Thirty-odd years of winding and grinding during nonstop two-hours-at-a-stretch performances around the world have kept the machine a perfect , well-tuned instrument that struts , glides and shimmies on legs that have become as legendary as her music . Performing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need anything else ? " she asks , chuckling . In addition to the great body , there is the great face , which has weathered the storm of abuse with astonishing flawlessness . The high cheekbones , sensual mouth and smooth caramel skin show not a scar from the years of beatings suffered at the hands of a violent husband  --  testament to the combination of good genes from both her African-American and Native American ancestral stock . Tina has grown philosophical about those years spent with Ike . " I 've forgiven Ike , " she says , " but I have n't had the need to sit and talk with him . If I see him , it 's " Hello , how are you ? " but there 's no conversation . I 've done all of that . I was a friend . But now I 'm finished with that person . There comes a time in your life when you do n't invite certain vibrations back . " Ike , the guitar-playing leader of the band that accompanied what came to be known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager-husband who created Tina Turner , then became the nemesis wife abuser who tormented her . " Ike was very good to me at first , when we were friends , " Tina explains . " Then we had a hit record " A Fool in Love , " which rose to number two on the R &B; charts in 1961 , and he became obsessive and afraid that someone would take me away from him . I think that interfered with the friendship . And then drugs interfered . I told him that I would n't leave him . It was his shortcoming that he did n't realize I 'm loyal and I gave my word . That 's why I stayed . I was in control of staying . Intellectuals can put any kind of label on it they want to : I was a victimized woman , battered , blah , blah , blah . I do n't give a crap about that . I did what I had to do there . And I finished it . " Tina stayed only partly because she wanted to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for . " This man had had a hard time , " she explains . " He had a lot of anger as a Black man growing up in Mississippi  --  this is a man who walked from Mississippi to Tennessee when he left home . He should have stayed a producer , but he wanted to be a star , and I felt he deserved that . And he became that . " But there were also Ike and Tina 's four sons to consider ( two were Ike 's by another woman , one was Tina 's by a former boyfriend and one was Ike and Tina 's together ) . " I loved Ike , " Tina says of what perhaps finally kept her around . " But I was never in love . On some level it was a form of addiction because I depended on him . He was very good to me when we were friends . " It was when Ike and Tina became lovers that they stopped being friends and trouble started . " We definitely would have had a longer-lasting relationship if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She is n't sure exactly why sex changes things , only that it does . Issues of power and control suddenly become paramount , insecurities are heightened , vulnerabilities exposed . What Tina is sure of , though , is that she and Ike Turner have been around the dance floor before  --  in another lifetime  --  and that their years together in this lifetime represented some karmic debt owed , some unfinished business demanding resolution . " I 'm a practicing Buddhist and I believe in karma and reincarnation  --  that there are other lives , that the soul goes on . There is nothing else that makes sense in terms of Ike and me being together in this life . I was never attracted to him sexually , and he was never attracted to me sexually . " For a woman who has become the closest Black America has had to a bona fide sex goddess , sex has never been particularly on Tina Turner 's mind . Nor has Tina been particularly dependent on the love of a man to define her , her years with Ike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she says . " That 's never been my orientation . Unfortunately , too many women today do n't value their own independence . " Tina clearly does . She credits the strength she gained from the discipline of Buddhism ( a member of the Ikettes introduced her to the religion in the early seventies ) as giving her the courage to finally up and leave Ike in 1976 . They were in Dallas on the first stop on a national tour . Ike had beaten her bloody en route from the airport to the hotel . After he 'd fallen asleep in the hotel room , Tina threw on a cape to cover her bloodstained suit , put on sunglasses to mask her bruised face , wrapped her head in a scarf and ran out of the hotel onto the streets of Dallas with 36 cents and a Mobil credit card in her pocket . She found refuge in a nearby Ramada Inn . After she told the manager who she was , he put her up in his best suite . She then called Ike 's lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to L.A. and gave her a place to stay there . Thus began the slow climb back from marital violence to freedom , independence and the kind of mainstream superstardom that had always eluded the Ike and Tina Turner Revue . For several years after leaving Ike , Tina made a living doing everything from cleaning and organizing the homes of the various people kind enough to take her in to appearing on game shows and then doing cabaret acts . Ann-Margret , the singer and dancer who was a regular hit on the Las Vegas circuit , was pivotal in helping Tina break into that lucrative venue . At the time of the split , the Ike and Tina Turner Revue had begun the crossover move to big club and hotel acts and also found a large and appreciative audience in Europe , thanks largely to their 1969 tour with the Rolling Stones . As a solo act Tina turned out indeed to have that undefinable quality known as star power , but her lounge act seemed a throwback to the sixties , and she had yet to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she met Roger Davies , the Australian manager who would take her career in hand and firmly guide it straight to the top . Davies first made her get rid of her band and most of the dancers  --  the old bump-and-grind routine was dated . And most daring of all , he changed the music she sang : The bellowing rock and roll and rhythm and blues that had been the Tina Turner trademark were replaced with a slicker , more polished mixture of rock and pop . The new Tina Turner still gives off much heat dining her performances ; there 's still the sexual magnetism , though her Famous legs are now just as likely to be wrapped in tight leather jeans as exposed in slinky minidresses . There are still the wigs  --  shorter and shag-cut now . " I 've had weaves and I 've worn extensions , " Tina says without guile or hesitation . " What can I tell you ? I like the freedom and ease of wigs . I have mine custom-made and I buy a very good quality of hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere . " Since her Grammy-winning Private Dancer album , Tina has had two major world tours ; costarred in a Mel Gibson movie , Madmax Beyond Thunderdome ; and been the subject of a music documentary about her life that aired on the Disney channel last March . She 's now set to make history as a living Black woman whose story is being told in film . What else is there , except maybe the love of a good man ? Tina has that too , with Erwin Bach , a German she has been seeing for about six years who is a record-company executive and 16 years younger than she is . " You would think that he 's older than his years , " Tina points out . Is love with a white man different from love with a Black one ? " Nobody 's ever asked me that , but I 'd have to say that love is love , " Tina answers slowly . " Something else might sometimes interfere  --  culture , for one thing . And the attitudes that go with the culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . But I have n't really had enough Black men to compare . Relationships with white men have been a learning process . I 've learned how they think , and I 've been treated very nicely , in a feminine sort of way . I 've been made to feel that I 'm cared for . " These days Tina Turner would n't have it any other way . Marriage , however , is not a priority in the relationship . " I 've been married , " Tina notes , " and my attitude about marriage is that people do it for a few reasons : It 's a ceremony , it 's a crutch , it 's a dependency , and I do n't need any of them  --  neither does my boyfriend . We 're both independent . We 're together . We do n't need the vows . I 'm happy that I have a mate . " What Tina Turner would really like is to take off about five years from the grueling grind of globe-trotting performing . " I 've been everywhere except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her rigorous touring schedule . She has also broken records for the sheer number of screaming , adoring fans who show up at her concerts . In 1988 , for instance , a record-breaking 182,000 ticket holders jammed Maracana Soccer Stadium in Brazil during her colossal Foreign Affair tour . Tina , like many African-American stars , plays to a much more devoted following abroad than in the States , and as a result , she divides her time between Los Angeles , Germany and France , where she has residences . " We 're appreciated in Europe because we 're considered artists . And Europe has always appreciated its artists . " Truth be told , fans have always appreciated Tina Turner on both sides of the Atlantic . But now she 's finally starting to get her propers . This tough lady just keeps on burnin ' ' . ANGELA BASSETT PLAYS LIVING LEGEND TINA TURNER Suddenly last summer , the casting call spread like wildfire across the land . For reenacting the rags-to-riches life of one Anna Mae Bullock  --  who would grow up to enthrall the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lured the likes of half the actresses in Hollywood . Head shots from Tina-wannabes poured into the Disney offices . But the coveted role finally went to 34-year-old Angela Bassett , who last year played Katherine Jackson in the television miniseries The Jacksons : An American Dream and Betty Shabazz in the film Malcolm X. It was the challenge of playing a character from ages 15 to 53  --  a rarefied opportunity for a Black actress a la Roots , Queen or Sounder  --  that enticed the Florida native to answer the call . And , yes , she plays the diva with " Proud Mary " precision . Q : How did you prepare for this high-energy role ? A : I had a dialect coach , a singing coach , a choreographer and a personal trainer for 30 days before the filming began . I lifted weights for two hours a day , six days a week , and went on a high-protein , no-sweets diet  --  egg whites , tuna without mayo , vegetables  --  to get Tina 's incredibly muscular physique . If I had had two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to enter a bodybuilding contest afterward . I have to admit , though , once filming began and I saw the results of the all the hard work I 'd put in , I was like , " Wow , this is great ! " Q : How did you feel about playing a living legend ? A : Well , both Betty Shabazz and Katherine Jackson are still alive . But playing Tina was a real challenge because I 'd never played a character of such great sex appeal before . I was really skeptical about the role until I met her in person . Q : What was your one-on-one impression of Tina ? A : I met Tina Turner for the first time only a few days before my audition at a recording studio in Los Angeles . She had just flown in from Germany . When I walked into the room , she immediately hugged me and told her manager that she thought I was " beautiful , " and then she started showing me some of the dance routines from her days with the Ikettes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that she 's just a warm , down-to-earth person . Her sex-goddess image is only a public persona . In fact she 's a dedicated performer , who loves what she does for a living . Seeing her energy , her serious work ethic and just how beautiful she really is up close was all the inspiration I needed to be able to take on anything . When I walked out of that room , I was flying on cloud nine and I knew I would give the part everything I had ! Audrey Edwards is the editor-at-large of this magazine . <p>
