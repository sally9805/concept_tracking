The old tractors just keep coming around the corner of Mulberry and Main in downtown Wilmington , Ohio , a sputtering battalion of Oliver Super 55s , McCormick Farmalls and Minneapolis Molines  --  the stars of the Clinton County Corn Festival 's 1997 parade . Families line the sidewalks , children wave to the farmers as they pass , but after 20 minutes Kathy Wiley has seen enough . A sylphlike executive secretary at Warner Bros. in Burbank , Calif. , Wiley , 31 , switches off her videocamera and wrinkles her nose at her husband Jim , who is busy snapping photos . <P> " More tractors , " Kathy says . <P> " Yeah ! " says Jim , 38 , a barrel-chested film-distribution manager with a chubby , boyish face . He lowers his camera . " I never knew there were so many different kinds . " His eyes are glittering . <P> " I know , " says Kathy , whose eyes are not . " I 'm like , Will it ever end ? " Then she sees her husband 's enthusiasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she ca n't help glancing up at the autumn clouds , which are sprinkling cool , fat raindrops onto the parade . <P> " I love this weather , " Jim says . <P> " You 've loved everything since we got here , " Kathy teases . <P> Jim makes a face . " In L.A. I endured 15 solid years of sunshine , " he says . " All those rays every day  --  they aggravated me . " <P> The Wileys may look like tourists , but they are not . Emigres from urban America , they have come to rural southwestern Ohio to escape L.A. 's noise , traffic , crime , smog and cost of living  --  not to mention its cutthroat film industry  --  and reach for the kind of safe , close-knit way of life Jim recalls from his childhood in tiny Sharpsville , Pa . " Living in L.A. , my vision became blurred and twisted , " he says . " I was spoiled . I had secretaries doing everything for me . All I did was talk on the phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim quit his job as a manager at Warner Bros. and took a position in Wilmington ( pop . 13,000 ) with Technicolor 's fast-growing film-distribution unit , one of many cutting-edge firms relocating to small-town America . He is elated at the move , but Kathy , born and raised in the San Fernando Valley , is n't so sure . Still working at Warner Bros. and settling affairs in Burbank , she came to Wilmington for the first time a week before the parade , wearing a fixed smile and a dazed , where-am-I ? stare . The couple spent the week house hunting on the back roads of Ohio , videotaping faded barns , visiting newly sprouted subdivisions , stopping by an auction where a farmhouse and its contents were put on the block . There they met Gary Kersey , a garrulous auctioneer who took one look at Kathy 's tight black jeans and Jim 's designer eyewear and asked , " You folks have any idea what you 're getting yourselves into ?
