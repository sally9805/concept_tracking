On a raw Sunday morning in the desert uplands north of Los Angeles , 15 disciples gather by a wire fence to absorb the teachings of a visiting guru . " Are you nervous ? " the guru asks Katie Stangler , 16 , in his thick Scottish brogue . Katie nods . " Ah , you do n't have to be . Just do your usual thing , and forget I 'm here . I 'll come in and help you if you 're struggling . " <P> Katie is struggling within seconds . Her Border collie lunges at a trio of sheep , sending them skittering in panic . " Down , Tess , " she yells , to little effect . The guru takes her elbow . " We 'll try to dispense with some of that energy , " he says . Within 10 minutes , aided by a flexible wand and a set of arcane commands  --  Come bye , Away to me , Take time  --  he has woven girl , collie and ewes into a graceful choreography of pursuit and capture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tess prostrates herself smartly . " Look at that , " the guru exclaims . " I thought you said that dog did n't know how to lie down ! " On the sidelines , the disciples cheer . <P> The guru is a handsome , 40-year-old Highlander named Alasdair MacRae , widely regarded as the most dangerous of all " dangerous men "  --  the insider 's term for virtuoso sheepdog handlers . The son of a tenant farmer , MacRae is a newfangled sort of celebrity . In centuries past , those who handled sheepdogs were known as shepherds , and their occupation was so humble that many fled to America to escape it . These days , however , competitive sheepherding ranks among the fastest-growing outdoor sports in the U.S. Fifteen years ago , perhaps a dozen sheepdog trials were held each year ; now there are more than 250 . Tens of thousands of prosperous suburbanites , like those here , spend every weekend training their dogs to usher scatterbrained sheep into formations of almost military precision . And each handler dreams of being the next MacRae @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them with Nan , the Michael Jordan of Border collies ) has dominated the U.S. National Finals . <P> There is little money to be had in sheepdog trialing ; even the richest purses fail to break $3,000 . Nor , for the less than dangerous , is there much glory . " You get knocked down , " says Adrienne Paier Wienir , 55 , an artist from Encino , displaying a fresh bruise on her forehead . " You get covered with dust and sheep snot . " <P> So what 's the attraction ? Part of it is nostalgia . " Sheepherding harks back to an age when life was less complicated , " says Wienir . " There 's that ancient sense of pastoral peacefulness . " Harried aristocrats from Marie Antoinette onward have unwound by playing peasant , and in flush times the middle classes follow suit .
