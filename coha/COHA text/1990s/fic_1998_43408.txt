Chantal <p> She still does n't know . <p> Chantal sits cross-legged on my futon , leaning back against the blue cushions . She hugs my stuffed lion close . Its golden fur glows in the light of my single working lamp , blending into her honey-brown skin . Her skin is a legacy of her despised mother , the fashion model . She is n't as gorgeous as her mother had been , and she is n't looking her best at the moment , tears running down her face , dressed in rumpled clothing she 's slept in for two days , but she 's still quite beautiful . Not that I 'm objective . <p> I 'm trying to listen to her telling me again just how much she 'd loved Jeff , but even the gallon of chocolate ice cream before us is starting to lose its appeal as I listen to the story for the hundredth time , in yet another variation . She 's done this before . Fallen in love , had great sex , realized she had picked a jerk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always line with the wrong guy . It was only a month or so ago that I 'd started to wonder if she were really a lesbian . <p> We 'd discussed it before , since I 'd come out to her years ago , but she 'd always denied the possibility and changed the topic . She 'd started avoiding my touch then too , giving brief hugs on greeting and parting and sitting much farther away than she had before . Right now I 'm regretting having a full-size futon , large enough that she can easily sit out of reach . I 'd have to lean way over before could run my fingers over those impossibly long brown legs , curving down her calf to cup her foot in my small hands , gently rubbing her toes . She starts sniffling again , and I hand her another tissue . <p> My heart is beating much too fast , and I ca n't stop looking at her , hoping she wo n't notice it . Time is achingly slow . I avoid looking at my watch . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh no . If it were up to me , I would have her safe in my bed , in my arms forever . <p> The doorbell rings . She looks up helplessly . <p> " Do n't worry , Chantal . I 'll get rid of whoever it is . Just hang on a sec . " Her sniffle is quickly smothered in tissues . <p> " Who is it ? " <p> " Domino 's delivery . " <p> " We did n't order any . " <p> " Hey , I got your pizza right here . " <p> The voice is muffled by the intercom . " I 'd better go down . " I tell her . Huddled there in her huge green flannel shirt , bleached blond hair falling across her face , she is so much a child . <p> Down the half flight of stairs , the man in the crisp white shirt stands holding a pizza , having come through our broken security doors . He holds out the pizza box . I reach out ; he drops the box and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crumbling plaster wall of the stairwell . I am almost falling onto him . I tense , then feel the prick of a knife through my black t-shirt . It is uncomfortably cold against my rib . <p> " Christ ! " explodes unbidden from my throat , my voice rising dangerously . " What the fuck are you ... " <p> " Shut up , you stupid bitch . " he says , deceptively calm , in a voice pitched to carry through my open door . I can tell he is nervous . The knife trembles against me , and I am terrified of what is happening here in this now unfriendly building . This scene has gone out of control , and I no longer know what he , or I , will do . We enter my apartment , and he swings the door closed with his foot , not bothering to turn the lock . <p> Chantal has risen from the futon and stands framed in a halo of flickering light . That lamp has never been reliable , and in this uncertain moment it sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not a sound , bitch . " he warns , cutting off the scream that is only now rising in her throat . " If the neighbors hear anything unpleasant , that 's it for your girlfriend . " <p> Chantal sinks down onto rumpied blue blankets , a moan caught in her butterfly mouth and frightened eyes locked on the glint of bright steel against black silk . I feel a sharp pain where the knife point lies poised against me , but it is impossible to tell if I am actually bleeding against the black . <p> " Strip . " he orders her , an unnerving thread of excitement clear in the tremor of his voice . <p> She shakes her head mutely in protest , wrapping her arms tight around her golden body . She must not know how that motion pulls the shirt taut against full breasts , how it pulls the fabric sliding up her legs , baring even more tawny thigh . I catch my breath in pleasure at the sight , and am brought back to reality only by the lifting of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start to shift away he slides a tightly-muscled arm across my throat , pulling me back . He has lifted the knife only to bring it to my throat , and I freeze . He slowly slides the knife down the front of my silk top , slicing it cleanly in half , leaving the fabric to flap aimlessly in the wind of the creaking fan . I wear no bra at one a.m . Small dark breasts have fallen free , nipples hard with fear , and the cold breeze . and excitement . I am wearing only black silk shorts now , and I can not help but think how beautiful he and I must look , black silk against his white shirt and pants , brown curls so oddly similar . He looks like my brother , I suddenly think , and then must struggle down dangerous laughter . My nerves are being stretched far too taut . <p> He lifts the blade up to a breast and I am truly frozen now as he holds the knife point a fraction of an inch away from tender skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If before his voice was nervous with excitement , it is now implacable . It would take someone far braver than my poor fawn to resist . She slowly begins to unbutton the oversized shirt . He is not content with the flannel slowly slipping from her shoulders . <p> " Stand and strip . " he says , and she obeys almost silently , muffling the whimpers deep in her throat . Endless moments later she has unbuttoned the last button and the shirt falls unheeded to the floor . My gaze slips back and forth between her , ( never before has she seemed so beautiful ) , and the possessive wanting in his eyes . <p> " Come here , " he says . At that I stiffen even more , wanting to slap that look from his face , that purr from his voice . <p> Her hands flutter up and down her body as she walks toward us , futilely attempting to preserve some shred of modesty , of dignity . It is useless . She is too fragile a flower to stand up against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within me . She stops , shivering in the direct wind from the ceiling fan . <p> His knife hand suddenly drops away from my breast , although his left arm is still rigid against my throat . He is fumbling with the zipper on his pants , finally dropping them to lie puddled on the floor around his feet . His legs are startlingly pale , almost blending into the white cloth . He wears no underwear , and his erection pokes out from his shirttails , rising hungrily . He smells of soap . <p> " On your knees , bitch . " he says to her , the hunger clear in the hoarseness of his voice . " Suck me off . " <p> And I ca n't take anymore . I jerk sideways , pulling free . His knife hand comes up quickly though , and his other hand swings in a wide grab for Chantal , only to be blocked as I step calmly in front of it . <p> " No . " I say , the words dry in my throat as I strive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please " as I slide to my knees in front of him , " let me . " My eyes are locked on his , and I fervently hope that he can see in them that he has pushed me far enough , farther than is safe for any of us . I am all too aware of Chantal 's gasp behind me , the only sound she has let herself make , and of her skin inches away from mine . I wait for his response , unable to read past desire in deep brown eyes . <p> He stares in silence for long seconds , knife poised . He looks me over slowly , insolently , and I will myself not to stiffen against his intrusive gaze . Finally he nods , silently . I lean forward and run my tongue down his stiff erection , I trace small , lazy circles around the shaft . I feel the pulse beating in him , as the salty fluid rises . I tease the head with flicking tongue until the growing fever in the eyes I have not dared glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for long . I suddenly realize that I find this man beautiful after all , and if he had n't had a knife to my throat I might have wanted this as much as he did . I realize that I do want him , despite the knife . I begin to tremble . <p> It is quickly over , and I swallow carefully , not wanting to rouse his dangerous unpredictability . I wait , kneeling in front of him , holding his eyes with mine once more , willing him not to look away , not to glance at Chantal . He seems to read my desire . His next words are addressed solely to me , " Strip . Lie down . " He seems to disregard Chantal , though his body is still tight . I do not think I can get the knife away . I rise obediently , and quickly step out of the black silk shorts , not wanting them to be torn as well . Some part of my mind must still believe that we will survive this . <p> I lie down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clear space in the center , baring the dark green sheets . I stretch lazily , offering my body up for him to drink deep . My eyes are focused on his face , on the raw desire battling with some indefinable thought . I doubt I could look away if I wanted to . Some tiny detached part of me wants desperately to photograph his face . <p> Portrait of a rapist . I am shattering into a hundred different elements , held together only by the need to protect . <p> His free hand is suddenly on Chantal 's shoulder , twisting her cruelly around , off-balance . Then the hilt of the knife is shoved into the small of her back , and she falls onto me . I voice a wordless protest , but she falls silent , curving so as not to hit too hard . Even in this she is graceful . Then he speaks . <p> " Go on , bitch . Fuck her . I want to watch you sluts fucking each other on your nice , clean sheets . Eat her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and higher , and I wonder if perhaps the neighbors will hear . Doubtful  --  the walls are not that thin . Chantal is shaking her bead at the stream of invective , terror blossoming , a flower in her face . And suddenly I reach up and hold her face still in my hands , my eyes promising her that it will be all right . An outright lie ; I have no idea what will happen after this . She reaches a hand up to clasp one of mine , then buries her head in my shoulder . <p> For this moment , this man is giving me a perversion of my deepest desires . It would be unfair to ask me to refrain . <p> I draw her down next to me on the green sheets , promising myself that I will be ever so gentle with her , that she will find joy . Chantal has gone still . Her eyes are closed , and she looks terrifyingly defenseless . I bend to drop butterfly kisses on her cheek , her neck , her shoulder . Carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Somehow I think that would be too much . For her , and for me . Her nipples are soft pools of darkness in the golden expanse of her torso . I lick my way down to them , nipping gently until they stand erect against my tongue . She has begun to move a little , confused by her body 's reactions . But she voices no protest . My frail love has no way of understanding this night , her only hope to trust in me to keep her safe . <p> His breathing is loud in the room , and as I kiss lower and lower on her sweet body , the first moan comes from him . It is a sound of pure frustration , and I am surprised that he restrains himself . <p> Then I am lost in the scent of her rising up beneath me , the brush of my breasts along her long legs , the caress of her curling hair against my cheek . And the greatest joy is that she is responding to my touch , my tongue , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers in my hair , running nails across the tender places of my neck . The lamp flickers wildly in the room ; as she comes moaning in my mouth we arch together suddenly still . <p> Chantal relaxes beneath me , her still-heavy breaths sounding . I can not hear him , I realize . I halfraise , and twist my body up into the wind from the fan . There is enough light to see clearly that he is not there . The knife lies , discarded , well within arm 's reach . He has closed the door behind him . And suddenly I am battling the impulse to reach out and take the knife and hold it to her sweet flesh , gaining a night of unbearable pleasure as she fulfills my every desire . <p> And also gaining her hatred , I shake my head , dismissing the last foolish thoughts . This will have to be enough . Her trust , her faith . Her slick body molded to my own . The memory of her arching against me . And the chance that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I lie down against her , realizing that she is somehow , impossibly , asleep . I am suddenly eager to join her . <p> The phone rings . I get up to answer , knowing who it will be . <p> " Forgive me , " he says . " I should have stayed with your plan . Bringing the knife was a mistake . You were both too beautiful , and I got ... carried away . " He pauses , embarrassed . " I 'll buy you a new shirt . " <p> " Forgiven . " I say , and hang up . How can I condemn him ? I asked him to come , after all . I go back to the bed and gather her into my arms . She murmurs in her sleep an uddles closer . I hold her tight in ... tive embrace , so that n ... hurt her . <p> Article copyright Trikone . <p> Article copyright Trikone . <p>                    @
