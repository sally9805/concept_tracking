Happiness and hatred walk side by side on South Africa 's road to democracy . Nelson Mandela wants to focus attention on the better life to come , " the historic moment when all South Africans , blacks and whites , will work together to build a new country . " But while joyous crowds of African National Congress supporters chant and cheer at his every appearance , Afrikaner Resistance Movement leader Eugene Terreblanche warns of trouble to come if whites are not given their own state . Last week a visibly angry Mandela repeatedly interrupted his upbeat campaign speeches to warn that he would match violence with violence if right-wing sabotage did not stop . In the past month , more than 40 bomb blasts have brought down electrical pylons and damaged A.N.C . offices and homes , as white holdouts like Terreblanche call for " total war . " <P> The national election campaign of 1994 , the first in which black South Africans will be allowed to vote , is under way  --  four years after Mandela 's release from prison . Although his message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the election does not seem to be in serious jeopardy . As the 75- year-old leader of the A.N.C . sped from stadium to stadium in his cream- colored Mercedes , he gave clenched-fist salutes and spoke solemnly to the faithful . His tones were alternately regal and schoolmasterish , his jokes slow to develop , and much of his dry but earnest text came straight out of a yellow-and-white binder labeled BRIEFING NOTES  --  CONFIDENTIAL . <P> His stiffness does not matter : the crowds shout and ululate no matter what he utters . He is making an effortless transition from freedom hero to South Africa 's President-almost-elect . His organization , however , must work much harder to transform itself from a liberation movement with a history of violence into a modern , functioning , grass-roots political party . Some of Mandela 's top lieutenants are learning to perfect their new roles as politicians under the tutelage of Swedish Social Democrats and such Clinton campaign stalwarts as pollster Stanley Greenberg and media adviser Frank Greer . The foreign experts are coaching the A.N.C . on everything from organizational structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to handle reporters . <P> That may add polish , but the A.N.C . bandwagon is already a juggernaut . There is hardly any doubt that the Congress will win a majority in the country 's first free , multiracial parliamentary and provincial elections on April 26 , 27 and 28 . But the A.N.C . wants to win really big and capture at least 67% of the 22.4 million eligible voters in the nation of 38 million people . That way the A.N.C . would take 328 seats , or two-thirds of the 490-seat bicameral Parliament  --  enough to write and ratify the permanent constitution all by itself .
