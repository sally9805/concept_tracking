<p> U.S. Army Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf , commander of U.S. troops in Operation Desert Storm , gave a briefing Sunday in which he announced that U.S. warplanes blew up an oil pipeline complex in Kuwait to stop the flow of crude oil into the Persian Gulf . Following are excerpts : After nine days , we 've flown over 22,000 sorties and air operations . In those air operations , we have over 26 air-to-air kills by the coalition air forces . ... <p> The coalition also continues to attack his ( Saddam 's ) air force in the air , whenever we have an opportunity to do that , and we also attacked them in their hardened shelters . <p> As you probably know , our air campaign has started to force his air force into Iran . Just since yesterday , we have over 39 aircraft that have gone into Iran . To be precise , in the last 24 hours , since 1900 hours last night to 1900 hours tonight , we have had 23 aircraft go into Iran . Most of them have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losses in the last 48 hours . <p> As far as naval operations are concerned , coalition forces have been actively attacking enemy patrol and mine-laying craft in the north Arabian Gulf and near Bubiyan Island . As of today , 18 enemy vessels have been sunk or badly damaged . <p> Ground operations continue to be limited to sporadic artillery and rocket- launcher fire by the Iraqis ... and coalition forces are countering that by employing close air support and artillery counter-battery fire . <p> As far as air defense activities are concerned ... to date , the Iraqis have fired 51 Scud missiles , 26 at Saudi Arabia and 25 at Israel . The most recent attack was last night , at about 10 : 48 local time ... On the oil spill : <p> We consulted with experts from Saudi Arabia , Aramco ( Arabian American Oil Co. ) experts , petroleum engineers , oil field engineers , and also people from the environmental agency of Saudi Arabia . <p> They said , first of all , about the best thing we could do right away would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire . ... It would burn off a great deal of the pollutants that otherwise would go into the gulf and continue to flow down . The other thing they did is ask me to somehow cut off the flow of oil to this buoy . That became a major interest of ours because , of course , we are not in the business of destroying Kuwait while we are liberating Kuwait , and we certainly did n't want to go in and completely destroy the oil field or do undue damage . On stopping the spill : <p> On the evening of the 25th , after we had gotten the recommendations from these experts , we just happened to have a circumstantial happening out here at the Sea Island terminal . The United States Navy encountered a small boat ... of the type that is suspected of supporting mine-laying craft , also a small boat that has anti-aircraft on it . And it 's the type of small boat that they 've been going after out in the area because those boats have been shooting at them . They engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sea Island terminal and , as a result of that engagement , the Sea Island terminal caught fire . <p> What the petroleum engineers and the oil field experts advised us to do was to take out these manifolds . They said if we could destroy the manifold here ... it was the type of damage that could be repaired very quickly once we went back into the area , in approximately two weeks ' time was their estimate . On oil spill 's effect on war timetable : <p> I do n't think there 's going to be any acceleration or any pressure at all . On Saddam Hussein 's threats : <p> Saddam Hussein did , in fact , say he was going to do this sort of thing before , and we did expect him to do it , exactly this sort of thing . He 's announced all along that he would do things to destroy the Kuwaiti oil fields . He 's also announced that he would go ahead and pour oil into the gulf to try and defeat amphibious operations , which incidentally this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Iraqi air force will always remain a threat so long as they have one airplane , but , as Gen. ( Colin Powell stated earlier this week , we have gained and maintained air superiority . We have freedom of action to operate any time we want to up there . And every time they fly , we shoot them down ... but the threat is always there , and we 're never , ever going to assume away the threat . On Iraqi surprises : <p> The only thing that 's really surprised me , as I 've already stated many times , about the Iraqis is the fact that their air force particularly has n't chosen to fight . And also how easy it was to completely take out his air defense system in such a way that we have freedom of action . There are a lot of surprises out there . I and my entire staff spend most of our time trying to think of what those surprises could be so that we 're ready for them . On Iran 's neutrality : <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter , and the Iranian government has stated that any planes from either country that come into Iran will remain there until the termination of the conflict . I think at this time we should take Iran at its word . They have consistently been supporters of the United Nations resolutions , and I see no reason why we should suspect at this time that they will change . I will also say , however , that we would be absolutely not worth our salt as military people if we ignored the fact that those planes could fly back out of Iran after us , and , therefore , we obviously have contingencies that will take care of that situation if it were to occur . On psyching out Saddam : <p> I 've been trying to psychologically intimidate him from long before the beginning of this conflict . I think we have pretty well predicted for Saddam Hussein exactly what would happen if he went to war against us , and he did n't choose to believe it . On Scud missile launchers : <p> We 've continued to attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large secondary explosions . ... We had a report last night of three that we attacked and successfully destroyed . But , again , it 's very difficult to confirm that sort of thing because you 're talking about a very small target , a very mobile target , and many times you 're attacking them at night as well as daytime . On war damage to Kuwait : <p> That 's an impossible question to answer . You know , he 's already gone after the Al Warfa oil fields down in the southern area ; he tried to destroy them . ... It 's entirely likely that he 's going to continue to do the same thing . So I do n't think there 's any way we can say , ever say , that we could liberate Kuwait without any more damage being done to Kuwait . On Iraq 's Republican Guard : <p> So far , I would declare our campaign against the Republican Guard as highly successful , just based upon the delivery methods and the volume that we 've been able to put on them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be under that type of attack right now . On reports of carpet bombing Kuwait : <p> I do n't know what the definition of " carpet bombing " is , and last night I turned to my air component commander and asked him the same question ; he said he does n't know what the definition of " carpet bombing " is . I do n't think what we 're doing would be described as carpet bombing . ... We 're being very , very careful in our direction of attacks to avoid damage of any kind to civilian installations . On bombing 's impact on Iraqi army : <p> To the Iraqi armed forces , it 's done exactly what we intended it to do to date , and I would n't just limit it to the army . I 'd include the army , the navy and the air force . On Iraq 's capabilities : <p> We have neutralized their manufacturing capability , their nuclear manufacturing capability . I could never say that there is no such thing as a nuclear weapon , although I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But what we in fact said was we had eliminated their manufacturing capability . And I would tell you we 're continuing to do exactly the same thing with the chemical and biological capability . We 're making sure that it will be a very , very long time before they 'll have the capability to build that type of weapon again . On bombing civilian targets : <p> We are probably endangering our pilots more than they would otherwise be endangered by following this course of action . By requiring that the pilots fly in a certain direction of flight or use a certain type of munition that requires them to go to altitudes that they normally would n't be required to go to , those pilots are at much more risk than they would be otherwise . But we have deliberately decided to do this in order to avoid unnecessary civilian casualties , in order to avoid destroying these religious shrines . On environmental impact of war : <p> I think that that is a ridiculous argument when you consider the cost of human life that the alternative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will probably be argued long after my time and long after your time , but I certainly do n't accept the fact that we should not fight a despot on the basis of the fact that we might , for some reason , pollute a shore . And I do n't take that lightly , because , believe me , I 'm a lover of the outdoors , I 'm a lover of the environment , I 'm a conservationist . But I think some great man once said there are some things worth fighting for . And I certainly believe that also . On the role of the Saudi air force : <p> The role of the Royal Saudi Air Force speaks for itself . Today , we had two pilots that shot down two aircraft . Those pilots are quite proud of themselves tonight , but the first pilot to shoot down two aircraft was a Royal Saudi airman . CUTLINE : SCHWARZKOPF : ' We are doing more than we ever have .
