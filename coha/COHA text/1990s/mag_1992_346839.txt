As the Soviet Union recedes into history , the threat of global thermonuclear warfare is waning considerably . But we are just beginning to learn some of the secrets of that cold war era when the two superpowers were locked in a state of high alert . This week correspondent Ted Gup advances our understanding greatly with a cover story focusing on the Federal Government 's grand plan to preserve post-apocalypse control . As Ted reports , planning went far beyond contingencies to shelter top-level bureaucrats and ensure the survival of the U.S. government . It also included plans to rescue the nation 's cultural heritage , from Leonardo da Vinci 's Ginevra de ' Benci to the Declaration of Independence . <P> For Gup , 41 , interest in this alarming story can be traced back to his childhood in Canton , Ohio .

Since bringing his energies to TIME , he has chronicled the illegal trade in elephant ivory , brought attention to the endangered spotted owl , documented corruption in college basketball and scrutinized the plight of West Virginia coal miners . <P> The doomsday government story required Gup to dig even deeper . " I ate a lot of dust , " he says , while sifting through reams of official archives . He unearthed documents about how Washington planned to protect the Bill of Rights and the Constitution . During the reporting , Ted thought frequently of his two toddler sons David and Matthew . " I pray that they wo n't have to grow up under a cloud of anxiety and that all of this will seem exotic and far away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only ones piling up the medals in Barcelona . TIME 's art critic Robert Hughes also excelled when he was awarded the first prize for literature in the Olimpiada Cultural . In a ceremony at the Palacio de la Zarzuela , Hughes was honored by the government of Catalonia for his book Barcelona . The prize , which was presented by King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia of Spain , included a bronze Miro trophy .
