In The Teachings of Don Juan , Carlos Castaneda learns from his Yaqui shaman that each person has his " spot " in the world , a place where the strength of the earth wells up and protects him from the demons of the psyche . But because of the work my father used to do , I come from nowhere and have no spot . Often I feel I 've built my life atop an emptiness that could implode at any moment . It is , moreover , an emptiness held firm by silence , by the untellable oddity of my childhood . My wife , who rolls her eyes when my most mundane childhood stories play out in places such as Baghdad , Piraeus , Petra , or Shiraz , does n't believe that I am awed by her childhood in a small Catholic parish on the South Side of Chicago . She ca n't understand that I envy her because she is a real American  --  because she experienced a childhood other Americans recognize . We all try to make sense of our lives by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these stories are subject to conventions . The chief of these , in this country at least , is a prohibition against the exotic . A Southern boyhood , or a prep-school boyhood , or an only-child boyhood might be interesting , but to be told they must be grounded in the ordinary . If the prep school is in Bogota , or if the father is a Rockefeller , the story becomes real and untellable . And if the father is a spy  --  or , as he prefers to call himself , an intelligence officer  --  the story becomes untellable twice over . You grow up swearing an oath of silence without knowing it and owing allegiance to an institution you will never see or know . But now , after the demise of the Soviet Union and the war against Iraq , I have come to realize that my childhood had a certain historical specificity . It was , with more intensity than most , a Cold War childhood . Born precisely at midcentury , I was made to understand at a very young age that somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being fought , that our side was locked in a struggle with another side , and that what was at stake was the very shape of the future . Of course , every American child of my generation was born into a world structured by this Manichaean paradigm  --  us against them , good against evil  --  but when your father 's daily work actually contributes to the struggle , it has a different , more intimate , meaning . Not that my father was vocal about the Cold War . I never heard him say a word against the Russians . But somehow we knew ( I think probably from our grandmother , his doting mother ) that he did not work for money , and that his work mattered in some deeper , stronger way that could never be discussed . When we were " home " in the United States , Dad left the house for " work " in some unspecified " office " we never saw . Overseas , however , his work was more visible , no matter how painstakingly he tried to conceal it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what my father did was the very ground we walked on , and the elan with which he and his colleagues conducted themselves was the air we breathed . For them , World War II had never ended . They slipped out of flight jackets and fatigues and into gray suits , but their new anonymity was even more lustrous than their celebrated role as soldiers . They were an elite . They were a team . They knew one another , but no one knew them . On spring weekends we took picnics to ancient ruins in the desert ; while the mothers scratched in the sand for shards and the men relaxed with cold martinis poured from my parents ' thermos , my brothers and I scouted the hillocks and ravines , finally sneaking up behind the men , listening to their deep laughter , their sudden moments of seriousness , and unconsciously reproducing in our games of creeping and spying the work a number of them performed out of their embassy offices . Hearing their laughter in memory now , I feel that it perfectly expressed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a relaxed picnic with the family ; the next , a trek in dusty Land Rovers deep into the wastes where the oil pipelines ran ; where a solitary coffeehouse marked the borders of Iraq , Syria , and Jordan ; where Arab armies engaged in maneuvers ; where bedouin chieftains beckoned them into black-cloth tents for hot , sugary tea drunk from little glasses with gold rims . My brothers and I came to accept certain announcements as plain matters of fact . Mother : " Your father wo n't be home tonight . " Father : " I 'm expecting visitors this afternoon ; I want you all to stay outside the house until after five . " One morning my older brother sprang from behind a door to scare our father , who instantly spun around , fists raised to strike , and then , ashen , explained that we were never , ever to jump out and scare him . And in order to make his prohibition convincing , he had to drop a corner of the curtain he kept between us and his profession . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to sneak up behind me like that , and I have to be ready to defend myself , " he explained gently . " I might hurt you before I could stop myself . " Many years later , in another country , a team of men from the embassy came to our house with suitcases of electronics equipment , tripod-mounted antennas , headphones , and other gear , and my brothers and I were old enough to realize what they were doing  --  debugging our house . But we were hardly surprised . Without ever knowing that we knew , we had understood for some time that our father was a spy . The silence of this acknowledged fact was the silence that legitimated many other silences within the family . " There are certain things we do n't talk about , " we were told . " It would be better if you did n't mention to your friends where we went this weekend . " I realize now how often we must have been part of my father 's cover . When we went as a family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet rose water ( " Drink a little to be polite ! " ) on the terrace while he and my father conversed inside , we made a quite different impression on the neighbors than my father would have made arriving and entering the house alone . We were a family of conspirators . One afternoon my best friend saw all of us piling into an army helicopter that had landed in the fields near our house . The next day he confronted me with what he had seen , and I blithely denied it . Us ? Piling into a helicopter ? What on earth for ? And because he had no one to corroborate the outrageous thing he had seen , my friend shook his head and soon disbelieved it himself . More than most other children , I think , I grew up seeing the world double . I saw not just the doubleness of adults pretending things to children but the doubleness of adults pretending things to one another . And knowing no other world , this seemed normal to me . The Cold War , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretended to be  --  a war of doubleness  --  was thus the architecture of my family and childhood . For middle-class Americans back home , and for children my age growing up in suburban neighborhoods of bikes and lawns and newspaper routes  --  things I knew about only from movies and old television shows  --  the Cold War was at most the sound of distant thunder . It came home to them only at moments  --  when Francis Gary Powers was shot down , when Nikita Khrushchev famously banged his shoe on a table at the United Nations . I found , when I entered college in 1968 , that my new friends were shocked by revelations about American duplicity at home and abroad . My father and his colleagues had done their work too well . All their efforts at the front lines , keeping the enemy at bay , had preserved the American delusion that the world could be seen in terms of right and wrong , Communism and democracy . That the United States had actually undermined democracies ( in , for example , Iran ) was incredible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew , or thought they had known , about the world , about power , about history . I joined them in their expressions of outrage , I marched with them on Washington , but though I shared their disapproval of American policies I could not quite share their disgust and disappointment . I had been prepared , having known for as long as I could remember that things are seldom what they seem . In 1957 we went overseas for the first time , sailing from New York on the S.S. Excambian and bound for Beirut . There we stayed briefly at the Hotel St. Georges , at that time the city 's only luxury hotel , a faded , fin de siecle symbol of an era about to pass , and which my memory conflates with the " large , proud , rose-colored hotel " of F. Scott Fitzgerald 's Tender Is the Night . The St. Georges , however , had no " bright tan prayer rug of a beach . " The green Mediterranean thundered onto the rocks surrounding the great railed veranda that jutted into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hotel , spearing with tiny forks the scalloped butter pats nestled in their dewy serving dish and drinking dark hot chocolate from a pewter urn . In the evening , as the sky flushed to apricot over the water , children and their nannies were given license to run , skip , hide , play over the veranda . Then night fell and waiters circulated busily , setting out tables , lighting small lanterns . Long after our bedtime we boys crouched on our balcony , peering down at the grown-ups eating their dinner , listening to the murmur of their conversation mingling with the murmur of waves in the darkness beyond the lights . My senses  --  the senses of a seven-year-old  --  absorbed everything . I was a roll of film stretched open beneath the summer sun . Every photon that hit me sank and stayed . Even today , when I happen to get a starched white napkin at a restaurant , the smell of fresh bread issuing miraculously from the fabric strips away the years and drops me , a boy , into the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these memories are now more than ever evanescent sensations . Whether we know it or not , in Brattleboro as much as in Beirut , history flows through childhood the way light passes through the curtains of a bedroom . I see now that the rolls and butter I consumed on the veranda of the St. Georges were not ahistorical fragments tumbling through the empty space of time but precise embodiments of French colonialism , which at that very moment was giving way to an American " presence . " The St. Georges itself is just such history writ large . It was named , of course , for the warrior-saint whose lance speared the serpent of heathenism and whose emblem accompanied thousands of Christian soldiers during the Crusades . Since the time we stayed there , it metamorphosed gradually into a modern but charmless hotel in the American style . Later still , seized now by one and now by another militant faction , it crumbled under twenty years of internecine warfare to a ghostly , but miraculously functioning , ruin  --  like the city itself . We flew from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the embassy , and stepped out of the airplane into a heat so white and thick that I gasped . Driving to what would be our house , I gazed stupidly at the tall palm trees  --  I had never seen palms before  --  beneath whose leaves hung clusters of what looked like enormous cockroaches ( dates , my mother explained ) . The car stopped at a pair of gates set in a high mud wall . Twenty feet away , on a pile of refuse bulkier than the car , two emaciated dogs lolled motionless , not even panting . The gates swung open . This was " our " garden and that was " our " house . Inside , we found the shutters closed , the hall dark as a cave . Huge fans turned beneath immensely high ceilings . The American couple who had met us at the airport introduced us to our cook , our houseboy , our nanny , and our gardener . In low tones the American woman spoke reassuringly to our mother . Then the grown-ups moved into the " library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we boys were left alone to explore . Looking back , I realize how young my parents were ( in their early thirties ) and how innocent . All of this was as new to them as it was to us . Still , I am astonished that they did not explain more to us . They had just transported their children to a place that was as different as another planet , and they simply let us loose in it . We were on our own , instructed only not to drink the water from the faucets and never to ask the servants for anything . We ambled around the shadowy house , touching , smelling , examining . In the library brown veins ran down the walls , and the books we opened had tiny sand tunnels running through them . Termites , my father explained . The kitchen cupboards were stocked with foods we had never heard of : squash ( not sodas ) , biscuits ( not crackers ) , sweets ( not candies ) . Down in the basement we found the belongings , awaiting shipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we pried into the boxes and lifted out treasures  --  chief among them a magnificent set of albums filled with huge , colorful stamps , most of them , if I remember correctly , from the Belgian Congo  --  my father 's predecessor 's former post . One evening a light rain fell . We stood at an open upstairs window and looked down over the garden wall at the street . Traffic had halted and Baghdadis ran out of the shops , hands uplifted , to touch and greet the spattering drops . Soon thereafter the days grew cooler at last ; we began to play in the garden . Arranging our soldiers ( all of them British lead soldiers with red uniforms and black beaver hats  --  the only kind available in the local stores ) on fortifications we had built alongside the irrigation ditches , we stayed for hours in our smaller world that we could control and understand . Like all colonial children , we discovered the mysteries of servants ' quarters  --  a small building behind the kitchen , occupied by our cook and houseboy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often we played our spying games on them , climbing into the trees near their door and watching them move back and forth from the kitchen to their quarters , understanding almost nothing of what they said but delighting in the mere fact of being unseen , unheard , and watching . We had just begun to explore the world beyond the garden walls  --  riding our bikes to the British Council library one afternoon , where we watched Laurence Olivier in the film version of Richard III  --  when the mood of the city palpably changed . Winter dust storms blew out of the desert , and coated trees and streets and cars in a fine yellow dust that penetrated doors and shutters and blurred the glossy surface of the dining-room table . But more than the weather changed . One day our cook invited us to go with him to a hanging , and when my older brother went to ask our mother for permission , she slapped him before she could think or speak . When we drove down Al-Raschid Street , we began to notice more crowds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The city seemed to turn in upon itself . Then we learned the word " curfew " when the government imposed one . At dusk merchants pulled down the metal grates in front of their shops and went home . Even the tiny corner store where we bought Mars bars and firecrackers closed before dark . Because we had diplomatic plates on our car , we were allowed to drive after dusk , and the city we passed through seemed to eye us through a thousand shuttered windows . Then it happened . The army revolted . The young king whose face was familiar to us from the stamps we collected was shot in his palace . We heard rumors that a mob chased two Americans into the Hilton Hotel , caught them in the lobby , dragged them outside , and tore them limb from limb . Tanks and armored cars squatted at the end of our street . My mother came into our room and told us to pick one book and one toy each . We were packing . We were leaving that night on a special plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution " and " evacuation . " While my father remained with a small delegation in Iraq , we flew to Rome , where we stayed for three days at the luxurious Hassler Hotel before moving to a tiny pensione in a street of perpetual shadows . Through the open bedroom window there came the sounds and smells of that great city , waking us in the morning and lulling us to sleep at night . I was eight years old  --  listless , restless , perhaps irked by my father 's double absence . One day at lunch I watched my mother open a fresh pack of cigarettes , then I covertly pocketed the slender strip of red cellophane she discarded in the ashtray . That afternoon , during siesta , in obedience to some inarticulate inner prompting , I walked down the hall to the pensione 's only bathroom , tied one end of the red strip to the bolt of the lock , closed the door , and carefully pulled the strip back through , thereby locking the door from the outside . With a swift jerk I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then I returned to our bedroom and told my incredulous brothers what I had done . We waited . At four o'clock the pensione began to stir . Pans clattered in the kitchen . The telephone rang in the vestibule . Footsteps padded by as people woke up and made their way to the bathroom . Gradually a murmur arose in the hall , and we drifted out to see what was the matter . A small crowd milled in front of the bathroom . Someone knocked , then thumped , then banged . Angry voices shouted in Italian . The proprietress emerged from the kitchen , straightened her apron , and knocked . No answer . She shouted . No answer . Finally they sent for a man who put a ladder against the wall of the building , climbed two stories , entered through the bathroom window , and opened the bathroom door to the angry , mystified crowd . " Ma chi e ? " cried the landlady , pouncing on a shred of the red strip dangling from the lock . At that point we thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our father was not there to catch us in the act of imitating him . We spent eight months in Rome without my father . Mother moved us into and out of a series of apartments with dysfunctional central heating . She found us a pretty English nanny named Nina whom I loved but who had an Italian boyfriend who was a pilot for a mercenary army fighting somewhere in Africa . Mother bought us matching flannel shorts and V-necked blue sweaters and took us out for dinner to small restaurants where the men made much of us and more of her  --  a beautiful young woman alone in Rome with her three boys . After the inevitable violinist had played the inevitable song that brought the inevitable tears to Mother 's dark eyes , we walked home through the cobblestone streets , banging our heels on the manhole covers embossed with the letters S.P.Q.R. S.P.Q.R. : Senatus Populusque Romanus . An empire once , a city now . Who can account for the influence that the vestiges of empire had on the historical consciousness of an eight-year-old American boy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the yellow Roman light , the knowledge that history is more than an aggregate of moments , of names of generals and dates of battles learned in school . History turns suddenly on a pivot . Whole orders of being pass away . No one tried to answer because I never asked the question that shadowed every monument and ruin we saw : what happened ? But I felt that no gradual process of change could possibly connect the Arch of Constantine with the Fiats and Vespas swirling noisily beneath it . History must be dramatic , swift , inexplicable . And it is ; the Cold War ended in three months , without a shot fired . We were living in Maadi , a suburb of Cairo , when the Six-Day War between Israel and Egypt broke out in June of 1967 . Egypt immediately severed diplomatic relations with the United States , and for the second time in my life I was evacuated , this time to Athens . Once again my father stayed behind to perform the invisible work that sustained us . None of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : he wrote one postcard , telling us that he went out a lot at night wearing the soft-soled shoes he jokingly called his " brothel creepers . " Many years later , however , and after much wine , he uncharacteristically dropped the veil and let one story slip out . On the night President Gamal Abdel Nasser announced he would resign , my father had needed to go out and visit certain " people " in various quarters of Cairo . The city was in upheaval . Distraught crowds roamed the streets , carrying placards of Nasser and crying out for vengeance against Israel and its chief ally , the United States . Around midnight , in a dark street of one of the city 's poorer sections , my father turned a corner and found himself twenty yards away from just such a crowd . ( He is recognizably American and speaks no Arabic . ) Almost before he could move , he was surrounded . A young man seized him by the arms , and instead of resisting , my father took the young man 's hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasses . The man paused , stepped back , then turned and quieted the crowd . When he had finished , he put his arm around my father and guided him through the mass , which parted like the waters of the Red Sea . My father continued quietly on his way . What had happened ? On seeing the crowd , my father spat on his hands and rubbed them beneath his eyes . The moisture there convinced the young man that my father , like so many Egyptians , had been weeping with sorrow at the news that Nasser planned to resign . This is what the man had explained to the crowd and why they had let my father through . An example of quick thinking , no doubt . But more than that . My father , I know , truly was saddened by Nasser 's announcement ; if he were a man capable of crying easily , he might have cried that night . He was n't just tricking the crowd ; he was feeling with them . But at the same time this moment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an act of duplicity . There will always be a need for subterfuge in foreign relations and in the gathering of intelligence , but during the Cold War these necessities became enshrined as virtues . And not just overseas . For many American men of my father 's generation , the Cold War paradigm of interminable struggle against an implacable foe was just the most focused articulation of a general state of being . Unlike Vietnam veterans later , many men of my father 's generation who returned home from war may not have had to deal with the shock of peace . There was no peace . A new war was nurtured into being , providing them a field in which to go on fighting  --  not just abroad but at home , where the ethos of conflict made the pursuit of success a cause , not just a fate . While the idea of capitalism had to be protected by cold warriors like my father , its actual triumph could be assured only by the unremitting and self-sacrificing struggle of corporate cadres back home  --  a struggle that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now what ? Thirty years ago , on a spring night in Washington , a man who was an intelligence officer stood with a martini in hand beside a charcoal grill , watching the coals glow . That afternoon he had left a large office building , driven home anonymously , had doffed tie and jacket and rolled up his shirtsleeves . Now his sneakers rested lightly on the brick patio of a Georgetown garden , and his gaze , when he looked up at the pale spring sky , was at once vague and vigilant . We played at his feet , and he protected us . Inside the house his wife , our mother , made potato salad and placed plastic forks and paper plates on a tray to carry out to us . Today my own young children take root and flourish in a small town in New England . Outside , sprawled on a chaise longue and sipping wine as hamburgers cook , I protect them from nothing . Their horizon does not end at a wall topped with barbed wire but expands indefinitely . I realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exact opposite of my father 's . Against his commitment to silence I oppose my claims to speech  --  as a teacher and a writer . At the same time , though , I inevitably reproduce him  --  in manner , in temperament , and even in work . Closeted in my study , demanding a household of silence while I write , I may be as mysterious to my sons as my father was to his . Constantine Cavafy 's poem " Waiting for the Barbarians " asks : " And now , without the Barbarians , what is to become of us ? /After all , those people were a kind of solution . " The premise of the Cold War was a bipolar world , every nation allied with us or with our " enemies . " For more than forty years the Cold War made this particular construction of reality more real than others . For many Americans  --  and I hope for my sons , whose shouts float up from the bottom of the garden  --  a choice has emerged : to view the world as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varied partnerships ; or to retrench behind a new polarity , peering over the battlements at the numerous , angry poor . Not , unfortunately , that these options necessarily exclude each other . I rise to prod the hamburgers . The world is no longer two ; it is many . But the boys have armed themselves anyway , I see . Hefting sticks , since we do n't allow them toy guns , they stalk each other through the dusk . At their age my brothers and I mowed down legions of Nazis and Commies . Watching my sons join the ancient hunt , I wonder : who will be designated as their enemies ?
