Sometimes in the act of giving pleasure the hinge of my jaw 'll catch , and I wo n't be able to open my mouth all the way . It does n't happen when I talk or eat . Or yawn . Or get my teeth cleaned . It happens only in the event named above , and it hurts if I force it , and I ca n't always remember which way last time I wiggled to get free , and I recall instead the two men I saw once and never again , one of whom held my hair with one hand and pounded my face with the other , the side where the hinge of my jaw gets stuck now sometimes , till I was in the car with the door closed shut . <p> There was no pain . I remember that clearly , though it does n't improve things . There was just the tiredness , the utter weakness a fish must feel , gills pulsing , pinned by a foot to the floor of the boat . <p> Gina had it worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fifteen men on a beach in Mexico , fog so thick you could n't see two feet in front . But you could hear her chanting , om om om , low and sweet like blowing into a seashell , Clark said . She was his friend , a traveling buddy , that 's all  --  he stresses this . Someone had a gun . When the chanting stopped , Clark stepped toward the silence that had become a hole into which Gina was falling , and the gun waved him back . Get the foock from here , said the gun 's bearer , or I blow your brains from your head ! Clark , who was to become a professor of composition and rhetoric , repressed the impulse to say , It 's get the fuck back or I 'll blow your brains out . Feeling , among other things , crazy compassion for the guy who 'd seen some but not enough American movies . Still the gun was multilingual . When the chanting started again Clark began shaking . Sometimes now , fifteen years later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quicksand , no strength to save even himself . He wonders if he 'll be able to rise to the necessary occasion if it 's his lover in danger . Wonders if this is why he 's thirty-eight right now with no lover . <p> When the man who picked us up outside of Binghamton stopped at Goody 's Bar and Package Liquor , I wan na check on my friend , Lenny and I froze like deer in headlights . It was so late , so moonless dark , so far , still , from where we were heading , that we just held still on the cracked plastic of the front seat , staring out at the blank night beyond the windshield , till the man and his friend stood on opposite sides of the car  --  bookends , brackets , end-punctuation to our suburban Jewish English-major lives . I 'll take shotgun , says the friend , and when Lenny does n't budge , not from machismo but a failure to access the jargon , he pulls him out of the car . Let 's go , Tama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barking across town . But I start moving , I have my arms around my pack and a toe on the ground , about to shift my weight out the door back to my life forever , when the friend jumps in , and the car takes off with my feet sticking our . I feel with a spurt of dread one of my sandals coming off . Start to lose myself in the web of what it might symbolize . <p> Afterward , in the hotel we found in downtown Binghamton , Lenny told me how trying to call the police he forgot 911 . It was a crazy thing , his mind was just not working , he had to ask at the 7-Eleven  --  he cried as he told me . <p> You do n't have to feel guilty , I said generously . I was working on empathy , a step in my personal program of character development , feeling the feelings of the other . I had been a self-centered child , or so it was said . They could have killed you , I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Lenny 's guilt kept him up in our muggy hotel room , made him think about taking a martial-arts course , about seeing a counselor . It was 1978 . Jimmy Carter was in office , though we did n't think about it Disco screamed through the open window . We went over his responses in depth , from their origin in the American frontier ethic to his relationship with his blustery father . <p> Hey , thanks , Lenny said . But he looked at me as if I 'd become someone else . To help him find his way back to me I described what he 'd missed , the looks and personality of the driver 's friend , not much older than us , hard and skinny , with army-short hair the color of his scalp . Who in a book would be named something from the Bible but called by the name of an unattractive minor animal , Mink or Wolverine . Would swear every other word . To me he said over and over , Shut the fuck up . I had no idea I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fingers , trying to disengage without hurting him , as my mother said to do with my younger sister . Through the hotel window came someone 's clear rage : I was better off before I met you ! <p> Lenny said , You could have bitten his arm . Or stuck your fingers in his eyes . <p> Clearly , he wanted to break up with me . <p> Have mercy , I said . <p> The next morning we went back for my sandal  --  I knew the place more or less , and who 'd want one shoe ? But though we looked for an hour and found a woman 's pointy-toed pump ( leather uppers ) there was nothing of mine . <p> My old socialist landlord , former union baker , was mugged , once , by a group of junior-high thugs who not only took his wallet but punched him in the stomach . For no reason . In bed a week , he blamed not the boys but the System ( capitalism ) , which drains out all your human feeling , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger to dip in the soup I 'd brought him : Punks . I pity ' em . <p> Afterward Gina ran naked into the ocean , said it had passed through without touching her . I am not this body , she said to herself , my sister/alter ego . I 've never met her in fact , but part of me aspires to her . A more devout Buddhist than I am a Jew , she has a system large enough to comprise what happened to her . Although her fingers trembled slightly , her face and voice , I imagine , were calm without the comfort of a boyfriend . The assault had failed to reach the radiant core of her . <p> I gave a pair of policemen the details of my assailants , including tone of voice , texture and smell of skin . I bought a baking-powder douche because baking powder cancels refrigerator odors and sounds cleaner than clean , no ? But for me , for weeks afterward , though I 'd upended my torso for quick and easy entry , it burned when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't the same either . I used to love to smooch him , on the couch , in the car driving  --  I loved the smell of him , even when he had n't brushed his teeth for a while . When school started in the fall we were planning to share an apartment . But afterward , with the pain gone so we could have sex again , we kissed only when he wanted to , not ever from my own impulse . <p> I think I 'm angry , I remember saying . <p> With those guys ? I do n't blame you . <p> I do n't know , I said , and he looked scared to death . I did not pursue the subject . <p> To be sure , nothing 's resolved with " those guys , " over whom in my dreams and daytime fantasies I wield the knife of castration . <p> But they are n't only out of reach of my actual vengeance , they 're out of my ken , Bad Guys , from nightmares and not daily life  --  no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school started , I studied somewhat harder than before . I did not become pregnant . Lenny and I very slowly became unacquainted . Like those Moslem men who cast out their violated wives and sisters , he felt I should have saved myself . ( I might be wrong here . ) At . this moment I do not know where he is or what he is doing . His degree , I think , was in psychology . <p> I switched to European history , which I teach now ( medieval and Renaissance ) at a small-town branch of a state university . I publish infrequent articles . I 'm writing a book about Christian saints . I 'm married to a sweet and burly man who teaches social studies and coaches wrestling at the local high school , who 'll protect me from marauders on the street . But when a male student cites an opinion with any ruffle of animosity I find it : hard to disagree . Now class , who can address what Richard is saying ? The area in which I feel utterly safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from people like the " guys " but something Lenny said a night or so after the event , Tell me the truth , was there any , er , pleasure ? He was embarrassed . But he just had to know . <p> I want to beat on him  --  I think about that . To sock him in the mouth , the eye , watch it turn dark the next day . What kind of pleasure ? , I 'll scream . Is there pleasure for you being 100 percent at someone 's mercy ? <p> There was nothing but terror in the event  --  I 've gone over it moment by moment looking for nuances , with friends , shrinks , and now husband Dan , though he 's not big on nuances . He does n't find power erotic at either pole . The sort of thinking that mixes good and evil he finds " sick . " I sleep well in the absoluteness of his distinctions . And that he does not require oral sex . When I do it as a favor he seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy at our son 's summer camp , not so big himself , who likes to play with the little kids , the preschoolers , Mercy , it 's called In this game you take someone 's thin wrist in your two hands and twist in opposite directions till the fragile chains of cells pull away from each other with a sensation that feels partly like ripping and partly like burning . it 's supposed to stop when the victim yells Mercy ! or maybe just a little later , this game of machismo , of personal grit in the face of pain , good practice , perhaps , for dissidents of repressive regimes who will not betray their comrades . But when I go to pick Noah up in the gym where the children wait for their rides , the weird kid is holding his arm , and Noah , who rarely cries from physical pain , has this blank look , as if the world has just opened its horrendous possibilities . What do you think you 're doing ! I hiss at the boy , and he puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shoulders : If you ever touch him again , do you hear me ? , if you put another hand on my son , I 'm coming for you , do you hear what I 'm saying , you think you know about pain but that 's nothing compared to what I 'll do to you ! <p> Big talk . It bounces off his skull of some weird , impermeable fusion of lead , kryptonite and pure evil . He twists his fingers deeper in his ears , shuts his eyes . I give him a shake , not as hard as I 'd like , in truth I want to kill this boy for making the world one shade darker for my child so full of light . This is a bad kid , I say to myself , with , obviously , problems at home . He has trouble controlling himself , the director says , seating him in a corner to wait for his mother who has n't brought him up properly , as I turn to hide the fact of my shaking , from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does n't get therapy soon and maybe even if he does , this demon boy from whom I must save my boy so utterly different from him . <p> But the next day when I poke my head in the door Noah is with him again . The two spring apart with identical expressions of rapturous guilt , as if caught in some complicit , consensual lovemaking . <p> In pain there is , or so I recall from childhood , a sexual element . I used to draw Prometheus on his rock , belly open to the beak and talons of Zeus 's avenging vulture . And Joan at the stake , flames lapping the hem of her tattered dress ( crayoned brown to resemble a sack ) . My fifth-grade teacher asked us once , seriously , was there anything we 'd give our lives for ? I loved this teacher . My sister and I played spy and counterspy , one or the other being captured by the Russians . Confess ! she 'd scream : Would you rather be Red or Dead ? , further compressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workbench . I remember a dark ecstatic quiver , not the sole province of male children . <p> The old pain/pleasure thing . Aside from God , that 's the heart of it , and maybe even as big as God , at least people cry Jesus , cry Satan with the same blood urgency , seeking the pleasure of pain in hope of the same  --  we need a German word here  --  **30;30;TOOLONG , I knew it once better than I do now , having set it down somewhere or stashed it in some inner pocket , incongruent with the work of becoming a grown-up citizen human being , what people do to keep their livers intact . <p> But in Roman Empire days , Julitta , a new Christian , saw her child murdered by a government official and rejoiced in his martyr 's death . It 's part legend , part fact : inextricable . Julitta is wealthy , noble , running from the Imperial law . Her son Cyricus , three , grown close to her body and soul over two years of hiding and wandering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurls him off his lap and down steps the way you throw off a pesky kitten . The steps are hard gleaming marble . Julitta , rhapsodic in the Christian death of her toddler martyr , goes serenely to her own , which will be accompanied by torture . Mother and son saints , Julitta and little Cyricus . <p> It was 304 ( date substantiated ) , with Diocletian fixated on the Christian Problem when he should have been securing his borders . More than the Huns he feared monotheism , the laser force of the One God overwhelming the wild crackling Olympian bonfire . But what is this drive to cast oneself into the bonfire ? In Alexandria a Christian grandmother named Apollonia is beaten by members of an anti-Christian mob . Some of her teeth fall out . Renounce ! someone cries , or it 's the pyre for you ! But when they light it she walks in of her own free will : Saint Apollonia . <p> With young Christian girls  --  virgins  --  sainthood was harder to come by . Moved perhaps by their youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lives and more if they returned to the Imperial fold , sacrificed to Minerva , married a noble . Catherine is my favorite , high-born , beautiful and learned . Denying her faith she can marry the emperor . Both she rejects , instead converting fifty philosophers hired to best her in debate along with the empress she was to supplant . There are no documents to support any of these tales but they inspired medieval Christians including Joan of Arc . Beaten and left to die in prison , Saint Catherine is fed by a dove . The spiked wheel designed to end her life in torment falls to pieces as she 's bound to it , its spikes injuring several spectators . She bends her head to the block , calling down blessings on those who 'll remember her , ecstatic mirroring the agony of Christ . Milk flows from her severed veins and arteries . The instrument of torture that failed to harm her will be called the catherine wheel . <p> But at dusk when a tree or stop sign turns into the figure of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unimaginable suffering or ecstasy . Nor , in my self-defense class , can I strike the padded attacker with even half my strength . My blows have an element of caress . I am neither saint nor self-protector . My ego refuses either to die or prevail . <p> Do n't think so much , says my instructor , herself a rape victim turned fierce with her message . You have the power to save your life . <p> I know that in theory . <p> You do n't have to be a saint , says Dan . <p> If I were a saint I 'd have forgiven them . <p> They 're scum ! Dan saps . <p> That 's what makes it so hard . <p> It 's what separates the medieval mind from that of the Renaissance , I tell my students , the notion of there being two sides . It 's the perspective from the mountaintop . Good-hearted , inept Jimmy Carter . What removes us from Catherine on one side and the Huns on the other , a sense of the unresolvable ambiguity of practically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My personal Huns had no such interior division . Resolute and fierce , they followed the rush of their blood to its culmination in act . If their minds held a self-image , it was n't even as naughty boys but as executors of a primitive justice . The younger , the wolverine , kept calling me whore , as if rape were a punishment he was meting out for my promiscuity . Cornell  --  the name on my sweatshirt  --  ' s a real cathouse ! , he kept saying that . He went first , and after waiting patiently for his friend , slightly paunchy , limper of dick , to finish , he re-unzipped and said he wanted to do it again , not in the car but on the cool night asphalt of the empty lot we were parked in , and this time I was to show how much I liked it . <p> Sometimes now I stop my car in bad neighborhoods , buy a Coke from a store outside of which stand dissolute teens trying to get up the energy to mug someone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be played and replayed till it comes out right or else covers over what in fact occurred , what I have n't detailed yet , not even to Dan . <p> But fifteen years ago my jaw was starting to hurt , something like a molar toothache , an augmenting pain with no end in sight . Then in the face of Wolverine 's uncircumcised dick , his bullet-shaped , almost hairless head , I push panic to one sector . From the small area of mind that can still think and speak come words from some high-school play , sticky nauseous-sweet in the back of my throat : You are a kind man . You 're a good and merciful man . Not to Wolverine but to the older , limper one . Prone on his backseat , I half raise my head , palms together in the Christian prayer position , though there 's nothing Christian in what I am doing , no ideal to exalt , of faith or sexual purity , no one 's life to save besides my own . I speak into his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tracks : I 've learned my lesson . I do n't need to be hurt anymore , please , really I do n't . <p> Kiss my hand , he says . <p> I do so . <p> Kiss my dick , says Wolverine . <p> I reach , but clumsily . He pulls back the flap of gentile skin . <p> Kiss it I said ! <p> I lean farther forward , alert , blank  --  whoever I was in the past or might be in the future in a bubble rising up and up . Then Limp-dick grabs his buddy by the back of his shirt . Stop farting around , he says . <p> Keep your eyes off the plates , Wolverine says to me . One look back and we 're coming for you ! <p> Thank you , I say , once , so as not to seem ironic . <p> But I do not feel ironic . I feel unambiguous gratitude . Later I 'll hate them for rubbing my face in the smallness and smarminess of my female power . But there on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love for the limp one for thwarting his friend . Between his rear plate and my view in the approaching dawn he stands , his arms crossed like a genie from a bottle , like my hero-deliverer , my God in his mercy . <p> I 'd rather be Red than dead , I say to myself . I 'd rather be anything than dead . <p> I walk in my one shoe away down the road . <p>
