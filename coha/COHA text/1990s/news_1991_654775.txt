<p> " WHAT I love is that you can change your face completely - anything is possible . " Actress Judi Dench , quoted at the end of an exhibition called " Slap ! " ( at London 's Theatre Museum through April 7 , is clearly pro-makeup . <p> Actor Denholm Elliott , quoted in the same context , is ( at least theoretically ) anti-makeup : " My attitude to makeup , " he says , " is the same as my attitude to directors - never use them . " <p> It was the British makeup artist Rosemarie Swinfield who suggested this exhibition in the first place . It 's subtitled " A Celebration of Stage Make-Up , " and traces its history from the time of poisonous potions via greasy sticks to today 's various and sometimes highly sophisticated techniques . <p> " Everyone 's fascinated by stage makeup , " Ms. Swinfield firmly believes . Nor is she taken in for a moment by Mr. Elliott 's humorous disclaimer . She 's sure he ca n't do without directors - or makeup . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basement of the Charles Fox company in Covent Garden , she lowers her voice confidentially : " It 's a curious thing ... ( male ) actors actually do n't like people to know they 're using it . They want it , but they do n't want anyone to know it 's there . " <p> In fact , such an attitude is perfectly in line with Swinfield 's own approach to her art . <p> She quotes Douglas Young , the man who trained her at the Max Factor Salon on Bond Street . " He said , ' If it 's working well you do n't notice it . " ' She adds : " It should be engraved on the head of every actor , I think . " <p> What she teaches her drama students , she says ( and quite a number of notables have passed through her hands at two of Britain 's leading drama schools ) , are " makeups to cheat the director ! " <p> Though this may not be the period of " the grand makeups " ( things like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion , " exceptions " ) , it is the period of doing more with less . <p> Her work with Nigel Hawthorn in preparing for his remarkable portrayal of C.S. Lewis in " Shadowlands " - a hit in London , now in New York - is a case in point . She liked the challenge . " He did n't want anyone to say ' Oh , he 's relying on his makeup " ' she says . " C.S. Lewis has been described as a man with the mind of an angel and the face of a butcher . " <p> IN her book , not inappropriately called " Goodbye Greasepaint , " Swinfield describes how she very subtly made Mr. Hawthorn 's features seem heavier and ruddier , altering the appearance of his nose with highlight and giving " a feeling of high color " to his cheeks by means of stippled " EF9 supracolor . " <p> She showed me the chart for this makeup . It looks deceptively simple . No use of latex or " putty . " Even an early notion of spraying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pink when it was washed out ) was abandoned . Little more was done than to strategically place " pales " ( highlights to make his face fuller ) , a brown shader to make his mouth look slightly bigger and the area under his eyes looser . <p> Certainly a " natural " makeup , but makeup nevertheless . But that 's Swinfield 's trademark : she 's " valued for the subtlety of her work " says Catherine Haill of the Theatre Museum , who was coorganizer of " Slap ! " <p> Swinfield says in her book that " There has been a quiet revolution in stage makeup over the last few years ; so quiet , in fact , that many people are not even aware of it . " <p> Factors in this revolution she lists as improved lighting , more intimate theater , film , and television makeup techniques adapted for stage use and a move away from conventional greasepaints , as colors have greatly improved . <p> Her own development comes out of the late ' 50s and ' 60s " when theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Old fashioned makeup , new theater . " <p> Some people , however , started to see the anomaly . They began to realize , as Swinfield puts it , that " in a gritty play you could n't come out with lip gloss on and all those things ! " <p> Looking back at photos of a naturalistic play like " Look Back in Anger " ( 1957 ) , the new , more natural makeup used does not look particularly natural anymore . <p> " But compared to some other actress at the time , " Swinfield says , " who might have had big false eyelashes and a lot of color on her eyes , it 's natural . " <p> If things changed then for women , for men " it changed to an almost total rejection . " <p> SINCE then , things have balanced out . <p> " The makeup in today 's theater is like the last piece of jigsaw , " Swinfield maintains . " You do n't have to do the grand gesture . Small , very important things change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she feels , is the final touch once he or she has worked out everything else to do with a role . <p> " Inside first , and then , finally , the makeup - and then you 've got the outside as well . " <p> This is her answer to young actors who often feel makeup is somehow " false " because everything should come from " inside . " <p> Such an attitude could hardly be more different in philosophy from Laurence Olivier 's often famous makeup that derived from his conviction that a character was built from the outside in . Swinfield tells how , when she worked at Max Factor , Olivier ( " He was very , very fascinated with makeup " ) " would come and spend a whole afternoon just working on a makeup . I heard he would probably go off and consult with someone else as well . " <p> She brings out the chart of one of Olivier 's remarkable transformations - into " Othello . " She heard that " he wanted to have false ears , false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - and he had to be persuaded down until he eventually came to this . " No latex at all . An " unusual " makeup in her opinion , " done with pancake . To get the shining bits it was wiped off with another kind of clear makeup , body tint . The shine is important . A ' pale ' would give a rather flat look . It 's one of the most famous of theater makeups . Nothing dated about it - you could do it again today . There was n't a lot of makeup , you see , it 's just a matter of getting it right . I can change the look of a face entirely by changing the shape of your nostrils . " <p> At this point in the interview , an earlier mistake caught up with me . <p> I had asked to see her demonstrate her skills . But her planned student for training that day had not materialized . <p> I really would , I said , like to see her at work on some victim . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subtle things , " she reiterated . " And doing pretty ladies gets very dull . I like doing cuts and bruises ... In fact - that 's what I 'll do on you . Very simple . Absolutely real in close-up . When I 've finished with you you can go out and meet your wife and she 'll cry ! Come and sit here . " <p> I should have run for it . <p> I 'd overlooked the fact that in the ' 70s Swinfield , in a career that has taken her into virtually every aspect of professional makeup , worked with Christopher Lee in " Dracula has Risen from the Grave " and Peter Cushing in " The Blood Beast Terror . " <p> Perhaps , after all , subtlety and the natural look can be very potent techniques .
