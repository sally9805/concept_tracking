A PARTIAL LUNAR ECLIPSE A partial lunar eclipse takes place on the night of June 14/15 , when the Moon slides into the dark shadow of Earth . This eclipse is visible from all of the contiguous United States and southern Canada . Total solar eclipses can be seen only by those standing inside a narrow path on Earth 's surface , but lunar eclipses are a more global experience . They are visible anywhere the Moon is visible , from an entire Earth hemisphere . Your first awareness of a dark notch along the northern edge of the Moon  --  the first sign to most people that the eclipse has begun  --  may come at the exact moment that someone else a thousand miles away notices the same notch . It 's almost as though the face of the Moon is a blank screen , on which we 're all watching the same movie . The time of the eclipse for you depends on your time zone . The Moon enters the darkest part of Earth 's shadow at 11:17 p.m . EDT ( 8:17 p.m . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a.m . EDT on June 15 . Then Earth 's shadow covers 69 percent of the Moon 's face . The Moon leaves this dark shadow at 2:27 a.m . EDT . Take note of the darkness of the shadow during this eclipse . It may appear darker than usual , due to the sulfuric acid mist and fine particles of volcanic ash  --  known collectively to scientists as " aerosols "  --  blown into our planet 's stratosphere during the eruption of Mount Pinatubo a year ago . In most lunar eclipses , some sunlight refracts through Earth 's atmosphere into the shadow on the Moon 's face . Volcanic dust may now be serving to block this effect . Also , be aware that there is a lesser eclipse happening before and after the main event . Earth 's shadow has two parts , a dark inner " umbra " and a lighter surrounding " penumbra . " The Moon first enters the lighter penumbral shadow at 10:09 p.m . EDT . This shadow appears as no more than a dusky shade on the Moon 's face . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see it . Even this ephemeral shading is gone after 3:45 a.m . EDT . The Moon is in a fairly distant part of its orbit on the night that the eclipse takes place . It may appear slightly smaller to you , compared with other Full Moons . On the night of the eclipse , the Moon is officially in front of the constellation Ophiuchus , not far from the bright star Antares in the constellation Scorpius . Also , this is the Full Moon nearest the solstice on June 20 . The Sun rides high in the sky at the solstice , and the Full Moon is opposite the Sun . Thus the Full Moon of June always makes an exceptionally low arc across the sky as seen from the Northern Hemisphere . MERCURY IN THE EVENING This month the innermost planet Mercury begins one of its better evening apparitions for this year . That does n't mean that the planet is fabulously noticeable , only that you can see it if you look for it . If you watch the west-northwestern sky just after sunset during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into view against a background of bright twilight . It starts out very low in the sky as June opens , but it creeps higher with the end of each new day . On June 16 , look for Mercury to mark the bottom of an isosceles triangle with the stars Castor and Pollux in the constellation Gemini . On June 24 and 25 , Mercury makes a line with these two stars . Afterward , the starry " eyes " of the Gemini twins drop into the Sun 's glare , but Mercury remains visible in the west after sunset into July . Mercury is highest in the sky toward the month 's end , when it shines at magnitude 0.1 . It 's actually a bit higher up after sunset around June 27 than it is when at its greatest angular distance from the Sun  --  called its greatest elongation  --  on July 5 . THE JUNE SOLSTICE On June 20 at 11:14 p.m . EDT , the Sun reaches its most northerly point on the imaginary celestial sphere surrounding Earth . This is the June solstice , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a hallmark in Earth 's 600-million-mile orbit around the Sun . On this day , the Sun 's rays extend across and beyond the North Pole , while falling short of the South Pole , reaching only the near side of the Antarctic Circle . At this solstice each year the North Pole basks in the light of a midnight Sun , while the South Pole freezes in noontime darkness . Even if Earth did n't tilt on its axis , sunlight would n't fall evenly on our planet . Because Earth is round , sunlight would beat straight down at the equator , while only glancing off the poles . Earth 's axial tilt complicates this picture . As Earth travels around the Sun , the Northern and Southern Hemispheres trade places in receiving the most direct rays of sunlight . It is the changing angle at which the Sun 's rays strike Earth that gives us the change in the seasons . Northern Hemisphere summer and Southern Hemisphere winter are technically the longest seasons . That 's because in early July Earth reaches its aphelion or farthest point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the June solstice and September equinox than between any other solstice and equinox . JUNE 'S PLANETS Mercury can be found low in the west after sunset in the last three weeks of June and into July . It is brighter at the beginning of this period , but it is easier to see in late June because it is higher in the sky . The last of the winter stars slide down behind Mercury and disappear into the twilight this month . The planet is 5deg south of Pollux on June 22 . By the end of the month , Jupiter is bearing down on Mercury from slightly higher in the west after sunset . The two planets are separated by 35deg on June 30 . The giant planet is easy to see throughout June . It shines very brightly at magnitude - 2.0 in the constellation Leo . Jupiter is still near Leo 's brightest star , Regulus , sometimes called " the heart of the Lion . " It will follow this star into the Sun 's glare in August . Look for Jupiter near the waxing Moon on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more prominent in preparation for its August opposition . It brightens from magnitude 0.7 to 0.5 this month . Early in the month it rises around midnight , but you 'll find it in the east-southeast only about two hours after sunset by the month 's end . Saturn is in the constellation Capricornus , the Sea Goat of ancient mythology , whose shape resembles an arrowhead . Saturn rises near the Moon late at night on June 18/19 . You can see Saturn in the southern sky at dawn this month . While all the other planets pursue their steady courses across our sky , Mars lingers near the fiery glow of the coming dawn . It is now coming up about three hours before the Sun and appears low in the east before sunup , shining at magnitude 0.9 . It seems as though Mars will never leave this location in our sky ! But by the end of summer , you 'll notice that Mars suddenly seems to be getting much brighter . What 's happening is that Earth is creeping closer to Mars in our smaller , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweep over into the evening sky this fall . It 'll dazzle us at opposition in early 1993 . This month , Mars is still moving rapidly eastward in front of the stars , and it passes from Pisces into Aries . Look for Mars near the waning Moon on the morning of June 26 . Venus can not be seen this month . From Earth 's vantage point , it is behind the Sun , in superior conjunction , on June 13 . THE STARRY SKY This month 's lunar eclipse takes place at the feet of the constellation Ophiuchus the Serpent-Bearer . This constellation sprawls over such a large area of the sky and is generally so faint that you may never have gotten a good look at it . Especially if you are in a country location , be sure to trace the outline of this mighty star figure as the sky darkens during the eclipse . Ophiuchus is joined in legend and in the sky to the constellation of the Serpent . The western part of the snake 's body is the serpent 's head , Serpens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cauda . There are many who disagree , but to me Ophiuchus looks just like a giant man grappling with a snake . The name Ophiuchus comes literally from the Greek phrase meaning " the man that holds the serpent . " In Greek mythology , the constellation Ophiuchus is identified with Aesculapius , said to have been the first doctor . According to the legend , Aesculapius killed a snake . Almost immediately another snake carrying an herb in its mouth slithered into the room . This herb revived the dead snake . Aesculapius studied the herb and learned about its healing powers . He became a great healer , expert at saving lives . But this infuriated Hades , god of the underworld , and he persuaded Zeus to kill the doctor with a thunderbolt and place him in the heavens . This legend has given rise to a typical symbol of medical professionals : a staff with a serpent wound around it .
