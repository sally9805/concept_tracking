<p> For the USA 's banks , this has been the most ominous week of perhaps the industry 's worst year since the Great Depression . <p> Bold , frightening headlines nearly every day . Sunday , Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . Chairman William Seidman , the nation 's top bank regulator , said the fund insuring America 's savings is bleeding at an alarming rate because of the high cost of bank failures , and needs a massive cash transfusion . Monday , banking expert R. Dan Brumbaugh , who sounded the earliest warnings on the savings-and-loan catastrophe , told Congress the insurance fund is already broke and needs a taxpayer bailout , just like S &Ls.; Tuesday , Citicorp , the USA 's largest banking company , said it is slashing jobs and its stock dividend , and is setting aside $ 340 million to cover bad loans . Citicorp is n't the first bank to take such drastic action , and experts say it wo n't be the last . Amid all the news came more urgent warnings that the entire banking system must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Despite endless assurances to the contrary , are the USA 's 12,000 banks on the verge of an S &L-style; collapse ? With banks so strained , are savings safe ? Can customers borrow ? Will the nation 's banking system be able to withstand a severe recession ? <p> Bank customers are nervous , concedes Seidman , 69 , who is also head of the Resolution Trust Corp. , the agency selling the assets of failed S &Ls.; And Seidman ( pronounced Seed-man ) admits he 's worried about consumer psychology getting out of hand . " We 've had a few little runs on banks , " he said . But he quickly added that the nation 's banks are in no way a repeat of the S &L; mess . " Mr. Brumbaugh is full of baloney , " he said . Here are Seidman 's views - taken from an hour-long interview this week with USA TODAY 's Jim Mc Tague and Gary Jacobson - on some of the main questions facing the banking industry : <p> Q : Is the public panicked ? <p> A : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deal of nervousness out there . And I think the nervousness is more on the borrower side than it is on the depositor side . We need a financial system that is providing credit or we are going to have serious economic problems . The biggest problem we are looking at is the economic downturn . We do n't want it to get worse and we do n't want it to last very long . But if the financial system is impaired or perceived to be impaired , that can certainly make the downturn worse . <p> Q : What advice do you have for depositors who have begun to worry about their money ? <p> A : As long as you have an insured account under $ 100,000 , you need only to worry about your government . Insurance is as good as your government . I think everybody needs to show some concern for improving our financial system 's performance . It clearly is not working as well as we would like . On the other hand , we often forget that 89% of banks have been profitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they earned $ 3.5 billion during last quarter alone . We do n't have an industrywide malaise like we did in the S &L; crisis . If there is a strong economic upturn in midyear , we will not be worrying about refunding the FDIC fund , and we wo n't be worrying about taxpayer bailouts . <p> Q : How deep and how long will the downturn be ? <p> A : Clearly the Middle East situation will have an effect on the economy , one way or another . Clearly the banking situation and the way it is handled can have an important effect . We have to work our way out of what I consider to be excessive debt that we got into during the 1980s . <p> Q : How do you get bankers to lend more , and , at the same time , deal with excessive debt ? <p> A : The answer is that there are a lot of borrowers who should n't receive more . But generally , when there 's excessive debt , you have to work your way out of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more costly to shut a borrower down and force him into bankruptcy . <p> Q : You 've asked Congress to let you have some extra tools - like forbearance - to help cope with the banking problems . But critics claim similar relaxations exacerbated the S &L; mess . ( Forbearance permits regulators to lower the levels of funds that owners must maintain in their banks to absorb losses . ) <p> A : There 's clear evidence that when you use forbearance in the manner bank regulators did in the farm area , it works out well for banks and the economy . <p> Q : How badly will you need new tools ? <p> A : At the moment we can pretty much handle things the way we 've gone at it to date . But these are what I call plan-ahead tools . We 're trying to think what kinds of things might be necessary down the line if things do get worse . What we have to do might clearly involve how we handle failures . The purist way is the RTC way . Close them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to be said for that , but it is very costly , both in terms of money and people who end up without jobs and communities without services . When you close down an institution and put its assets on the junk pile , the value goes down . We can trace a 10% to 20% loss in value by that very act . <p> Q : There will be about 170 bank failures this year and you 're projecting 180 next year . Will we ever get back to the level of 10 or fewer that we had in 1980 ? <p> A : I doubt it , and I do n't know that we want to . That was a totally regulated era where the banks became very noncompetitive and fairly inefficient . We are in a much more competitive world now . As long as we are a country with 12,000 banks , we 're going to see bank failures because there simply are n't 12,000 great managements . <p> Q : Is there a healthy level of bank failures ? <p> A : I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or bad . But clearly you ca n't have the insurance costs become so high as to make the whole industry noncompetitive . And we 're getting close to that . ( Banks will pay an insurance premium of 19.5 cents per $ 100 of deposits , beginning Jan. 1 . Seidman wants to raise that to 23 cents . ) <p> Q : How long will it take you to sell the assets from dead S &Ls?; <p> A : If the last piece is sold in 10 years , that will be a good record . We have 148,000 lawsuits and they 're not going to be over very quickly . But the big push will really be in the next two to three years . <p> Q : It took over 20 years to work through the bank and S &L; assets seized by the government in the Great Depression . Why wo n't this happen now ? <p> A : Well , this is n't the Great Depression by any means ; 4,000 to 5,000 banks failed then . The unemployment rate was 25% . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you think regulators overreacted in Texas or are overreacting in New England now ? <p> A : I certainly do n't agree with that in Texas . Nobody ever accused the regulators of doing much in Texas except arriving on the battlefield after the war and shooting the wounded . I 'm sure that there is a regulator who has overreacted and probably more than one . But to say the problem in New England is caused by the regulators is to ignore the facts . Their economy is in a major slump . <p> Q : Where are the healthiest banks in the USA ? <p> A : There are healthy banks everywhere . Even in New Hampshire , which is suffering great problems . But generally if you go out to the center of the country to places like Ohio and Michigan , you 'll find a very solid banking situation . <p> Q : Statistics show that big banks are in a great deal more trouble than small ones . <p> A : Bigger banks are much more subject to competition not only from other banks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the bigger banks are under greater pressure than the small ones . But if you look at bank failures among the two groups , they 're proportionate . <p> Q : If the banking system is overhauled , how should banks be changed ? <p> A : I favor creating a low-risk bank , which is strictly supervised and excluded from making risky direct investments in businesses and no-down- payment commercial real-estate loans . At the same time , bankers would be allowed to conduct riskier ventures in separate subsidiaries . <p> Q : What will that mean for consumers ? <p> A : The consumer is going to get better service . Maybe there will be two windows at the bank when you walk in . One window will say " Insured " and you 'll get a lower rate on your deposits . Another window with a flashing red light will say " Uninsured , " and offer you higher rates in exchange for higher risk . <p> Q : Does n't that mean customers will need more sophistication ? <p> A : Most people wo n't notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people will be using insured accounts . Maybe they 'll be limited to three accounts , which I also do n't think will affect many people . The average customer will see banks that are more efficient . CUTLINE : SEIDMAN : ' We do n't have an industrywide malaise like we did in the S &L; crisis . If there is a strong economic upturn in midyear ... we wo n't be worrying about taxpayer bailouts. '
