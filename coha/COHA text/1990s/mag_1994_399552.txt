On the sandy volleyball court behind a Monona , Wis. neighborhood bar , fragile-looking woman wearing an oversize lavender T-shirt leaps to slam the ball over the net , her short-cropped blonde hair riffling in the breeze . Back in the car after helping her coed team win its weekly game , she nonchalantly slides off that mop of hair and dabs a tissue over her perspiring bald head . " Losing my hair , " she confides , " upset me more than losing my breast . " Amy Parks , 38 , knows better than anyone how much she still has to lose . Last year the divorced mother of Heather , 15 , and Nate , 12 , seemed ready for the best days of her life . She had a challenging job as a design engineer at Universal Presentation Concepts , a Madison manufacturer of retail display fixtures , that paid in the $30,000s . In addition , in February she had married 35-year-old Bob Schmook , " my best friend , " a bright , funny $30,000-a-year X-ray technologist at local St. Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the couple became ecstatic in June when they learned that Parks was pregnant " I had my whole life in perfect order , " she says . It was n't until a July prenatal checkup that her family doctor found the lump in her left breast . A month later , the couple were forced to face excruciating alternatives to save her life : Either undergo a modified radical mastectomy to remove the entire breast plus nearby lymph nodes ; or terminate her pregnancy , have only the cancerous lump cut out and follow that with radiation treatments that would almost certainly leave their newborn with birth defects or leukemia . With either option , her doctor said her chances of living 10 to 15 years or longer were seven in 10 , provided her lymph nodes remained free of disease . They chose the mastectomy and their baby . But by the time Gretchen was born , cancer-free and healthy , on Feb. 1 , 1994 , Parks ' unusually aggressive malignancy had spread to her bones , lungs and liver . While the scourge of AIDS absorbs the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year , for instance , five times as many government dollars are going for AIDS as for breast cancer research  --  it 's easy to forget that Amy Parks ' disease has also reached epidemic proportions . An estimated 46,000 American women will die of breast cancer this year alone  --  up from 35,500 in 1980  --  and 182,000 more will be diagnosed , 69% more than in 1980 . According to the American Cancer Society , a woman born 50 years ago had a one in 20 chance of developing breast cancer sometime in her life . The odds have soared to one in eight for women born today . Despite the rising incidence , most patients receive the same treatment as two decades ago , typically some combination of surgery , chemotherapy and radiation . And the survival rates for patients with advanced breast cancer  --  an average of two years  --  have n't changed appreciably . Parks is unluckier than most : She 's one of fewer than 1% of breast cancer victims who are diagnosed with the disease while pregnant and one of only 6% who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfortunate : She died of the cancer at 45 when Parks was 14 . Characteristically , Parks is fighting back  --  and struggling against the heartbreaking obstacles that increasingly confront seriously ill Americans . Like many health insurers , her family 's health maintenance organization , DeanCare HMO of Madison , does not cover the $100,000 treatment that some doctors say is now her best bet : high-dose chemotherapy combined with a bone-marrow transplant . Says Dr. John L. Cova , a medical technology consultant for the Health Insurance Association of America : " Paying for this treatment is the single most explosive issue in health care today . " Although the treatment is routinely covered for other kinds of cancers , including leukemia and lymphoma , the National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) considers it " investigational " for breast cancer because , says the NCI , " more data are needed " to establish whether it 's effective . That leaves Parks and Schmook , whose net worth totals only $127,440 , searching for less costly therapies while dealing with the loss of Parks ' income , caring for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do when Parks ' illness gets the better of her . " The surprising thing about this disease is that I did everything right , " the usually upbeat Parks says wanly . With her family history in mind , she had her first mammogram in October 1991 , at age 35 , followed by another in August 1992 , even though the NCI had n't recommended regular mammograms until age 40 and recently amended that to 50  --  even for women with family cancer histories . Both tests were clean . Nevertheless , in July 1993 there was the lump . Late in August , a surgeon performed a biopsy . " When he told me it was malignant , " remembers Parks with a laugh , " I kept looking over my shoulder to see who he was talking to . It could n't be me ! " Says the normally easygoing Schmook : " I was furious at everything and everyone . " So began the couple 's agonizing choices . HMO oncologist Ed Prendergast spelled out the options  --  including , according to standard medical practice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lumpectomy and radiation . And if she continued her pregnancy and decided on modified mastectomy , there was another catch : A follow-up CAT scan to determine whether the cancer had spread would be inadvisable because it too involves radiation . She says that she and her husband gave the decision only " an hour 's worth " of thought . " We wanted this baby very much , " she explains , " and the mastectomy was n't presented as any riskier than the lumpectomy and radiation . " She had the surgery six days later . " Once the shock wore off , I was pretty optimistic . I was given a long-term survival rate of 70% . The odds were on my side . " Then , last December , in the seventh month of pregnancy , Parks felt a lump in her right breast . The doctors initially dismissed it as a swollen lymph node . But Parks was n't reassured . In late January , doctors finally performed a biopsy . " Bob and I both knew , " she says . " We were sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said , ' It 's not what you want to hear . ' " With Parks so close to delivery , her doctors decided to induce labor on Jan. 31 , three weeks before Parks ' due date . Seven-pound , three-ounce Gretchen was born the next day . The following week Parks had both a bone and CAT scan to determine how far the cancer had spread . The results were devastating . Malignant tumors had spread to her liver , both lungs and to her sternum and spine . Diagnosis : Stage IV , the most advanced phase of breast cancer . According to the NCI , only 18% of Stage OV victims live more than five years . Doctors ca n't say to what degree Parks ' decision to continue her pregnancy may have contributed to the spread of her disease . What is clear is that time is running out . " There is no cure for these women , " says Dr. Jeffrey Abrams , a breast cancer specialist at the Institute . " All we can do is try to palliate symptoms and extend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began the standard chemotherapy regimen that she continues today . She takes three cancer-killing drugs for two weeks out of every four : adriamycin and fluorouracil , which are administered intravenously at a clinic twice over every two-week period , and cytoxan tablets three times a day for the same period . Out-of-pocket costs to the family for this roughly $850-a-month pharmacy bill remain minimal : $35.70 every two weeks for DeanCare HMO coverage , which requires no deductible and no co-insurance except for a $10 co-payment on brand-name drugs . Oncologist Prendergast says that he will continue the chemotherapy until Parks ' cancer is in remission , probably until Thanksgiving . When the cancer returns , the chemotherapy treatment will be repeated . " It 's an endless loop , " sums up Parks . " And then you die . " Parks did n't like the prognosis . So in March she and Schmook visited Dr. Patrick Stiff , an oncologist at Loyola University in Chicago . Stiff recommended near-fatal doses of chemotherapy  --  five to 10 times higher than standard regimens  --  along with a variation on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stem-cell transplant . In such a transplant , the stem cells  --  primitive cells that produce infection-fighting blood components  --  do not come from another donor but from the patient herself . First doctors collect the cells from the patient 's bloodstream or bone marrow . Then she enters the hospital for about four days of intensive oral and intravenous chemotherapy to kill cancer cells . After waiting a few days for the drugs to wash out of the woman 's body , doctors replace the stem cells so they can rebuild the patient 's by now severely weakened immune system . Assuming no complications , the woman is discharged about two weeks later . Last year , at least 120 U.S. academic centers conducted an estimated 1,000 of the procedures , which cost about $100,000 each , according to Karen Antman , Columbia University 's chief oncologist . Stiff says that almost 25% of Stage IV patients who receive the treatment at Loyola survive three to five years or more without any recurrence of cancer , vs. fewer than 5% of similarly diagnosed patients who get standard chemotherapy . Stiff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undergo the transplant within six weeks  --  before year 's end . However , there remains the sobering matter of cost . When Parks called the HMO , a customer service rep said that the transplant procedure is not covered . " It is not a standard benefit for breast cancer , " says Jack Turcott , president of DeanCare HMO , " because it is a new treatment and it is very high-cost . " Such scenarios are multiplying all across the country . As health-care costs skyrocket , doctors and patients are being forced into badgering insurers to pay for treatments like HDC/ABMT . Says L. Susan Slavin , a lawyer with Slavin &; Steinberg in Westbury , N.Y . and founder of the pro-bono Breast Cancer Legal Advocacy Project : " These women are desperate ill . It 's outrageous that they have to fight insurers when they should be fighting the cancer . " On the other hand , there is deep disagreement among healthcare professionals on whether bone-marrow therapy has been tested thoroughly enough to be a proven treatment for advanced breast cancer . For its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trials to evaluate how effective HDC/ABMT is in treating breast cancer among 1,200 women nationwide . ( Loyola is not one of the participating medical centers . ) Results will not be known for at least three more years . " The very fact that NCI needs to test this treatment proves it 's experimental , " contends the Health Insurance Association 's Cova . " And when you cover the cost of experimental treatment , you raise health insurance premiums for everyone . " Many doctors vehemently disagree . " We know that HDC/ABMT is effective for many patients , " says oncologist Antman . " It 's the only treatment that offers hope for long-term survival . " Several state legislatures concur : In the past few years , Massachusetts , New Hampshire , Vermont and Virginia have passed laws mandating insurance coverage for HDC/ABMT for breast cancer victims . Wisconsin , however , has not . ( In August , a congressional subcommittee was scheduled to examine whether federal employee health plans should begin to require the coverage . ) It may have taken only an hour for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having Parks lose her breast , but their choices keep getting harder . The sheer expense of HDC/ABMT  --  combined with its unknown and sometimes debilitating results  --  have left the couple torn . " There 's no way we can afford $100,000 , " Schmook says flatly . " What bothers me , " adds Parks , " is that the high-dose chemo destroys your immune system . The women I saw at Loyola looked like death warmed over . " In fact , according to the NCI 's Abrams , there is approximately a 5% chance that the treatment itself can kill . ( Stiff says that no fatalities have occurred in the 30 stem-cell transplants performed at Loyola during the past 18 months . ) Shaken and unsure , Parks began investigating some unconventional alternatives . Last spring , for instance , she became excited about a book called The Healing Journey by California radiation oncologist O. Carl Simonton , who argues that meditation and positive visualization can bolster cancer patients ' immune systems to help defeat the disease . ( Typical exercise : " Imagine your white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize and remove any cancer cells . " ) " These women need some kind of hope , " acknowledges Paul Carbone , director of the University of Wisconsin 's cancer center , " but there is not a lot of conclusive proof that meditation helps . " Nevertheless , early in May , Parks and Schmook flew to Simonton 's Pacific Palisades cancer center for a weeklong " educational and psychotherapeutic session . " Since the $3,250 cost was n't covered by insurance , she borrowed $3,000 from her father . Says the cautious Schmook : " What Simonton does is harmless at worst and very beneficial at best . Amy believes it  --  that 's the important thing . " Puzzling over why she became ill , Parks points to the estrogen surge of pregnancy ( estrogen is a known risk factor for breast cancer ) ; a meat-and cheese-heavy diet ( fat consumption can promote tumor growth ) and genetics ( scientists are trying to identify a breast cancer gene , which is thought to be carried by one in 200 women and to be responsible for 5% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Including work she brought home , Parks was toiling 65 hours a week . " I internalized everything , " she says . Now , after accepting a job layoff in February , Parks has radically changed her routine . After waking at 8 a.m. , she frequently meditates for about half an hour . Often she spends two to three hours researching the latest in experimental cancer treatments , such as gene therapies and immunotherapies , mostly from books and articles sent by her sisters-in-law Peggy Schmook and Karen Boettcher , both Minneapolis librarians . She prepares mostly vegetarian meals and pops daily doses of vitamins A , C , E , betacarotene , calcium , calcium magnesium and a multivitamin , plus iron " when I feel tired " ( supplement cost : $15 a month , not covered by insurance ) . She also attends three different free support groups of breast cancer patients . Ever the optimist , Parks cites a landmark 1989 study at Stanford University showing that metastatic breast cancer patients who met with support groups survived on average nearly 18 months longer than women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . In recent weeks , the five foot , three inch , 115-pound Parks has been severely nauseated for 10 of the 14 days she is on chemotherapy . " Imagine the worst hangover you 've ever had , " says Parks , who sometimes ca n't get up for hours . But she does n't focus on those times . " I do n't feel like I 'm dying , " she insists . " I understand that , statistically , I have an incurable disease . But spontaneous remissions do occur . There is a part of me that believes if I remove the things from my life that are hurting my immune system , I can be cured . " Then , she adds , " I 'm not afraid of death itself . What scares me is that I 'll miss my kids growing up . I know darn well that Gretchen wo n't remember me . " In fact , the most difficult time so far has been talking about her illness to Heather and Nate , whose custody she shares with her ex-husband ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know I will be dying , " she says evenly , " so they can prepare themselves and say good-bye . I took them aside separately and said , ' I have something I want to tell you . But first I woman who is still alive 10 years after a terminal breast cancer prognosis thanks in part to changing her diet and lifestyle . " I said this exact thing is happening to me . The doctors say I 'm going to die . But it wo n't be soon , and I 'm going to do everything in my power to make sure I do n't . " Almost everything , that is , but the bone-marrow procedure . Even if Parks were accepted into one of the NCI trial programs , there 's almost no chance that the family 's HMO , the NCI or the medical facility would pay for it . Still , says Schmook , " if Amy felt very positive about a treatment , of course we 'd try to pay . But $100,000 for a bone-marrow transplant is money we do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could tap . With early retirement in mind , the couple have stashed away $34,900 in four savings accounts ; $7,600 in the aggressive stock fund Kaufmann ( up 6.5% for the 12 months to Aug. 1 ) ; $7,100 in two fixed-income IRAs ; and $1,500 in Phoenix Balanced fund ( up 1% ) . Their only major liability is a $58,000 mortgage on the $98,500 three-bedroom ranch house Parks owns ( monthly payment plus property taxes : $830 ) . A $300-a-month second mortgage is almost paid off . Parks would have to sell the house to get the full $100,000 for the chemo-and-transplant procedure  --  a drastic move that neither spouse is willing to make . " We ca n't sacrifice Gretchen 's or the other kids ' well-being for a treatment that may or may not work , " says Schmook sadly . The couple have pondered asking their parents for money , but " they do n't have much to spare , " Schmook says . What about community fund raising or asking friends for help ? " We 'd feel funny about that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could sue the HMO . Juries tend to be sympathetic to women in Parks ' position : Last December , for example , the estate of Nelene Fox , like Parks a mother of three with Stage IV breast cancer , won $89 million in damages from the Woodland Hills , Calif . HMO that had denied payment for just such a transplant . But after examining the DeanCare HMO policy document at MONEY 's request , attorney Slavin does n't offer hope . " Unlike most insurance contracts , this document states clearly it will not cover transplants like this one , " she says . " Her chances of winning in court are slim . " By March , Parks had drawn up a new will giving most of her assets to her husband , smaller bequests to her brother Clark , 34 and a cousin , and dividing her $60,000 worth of life insurance ( half term , half whole life ) evenly among her three children , held in trust by Schmook until they turn 21 . Parks ' ex-husband will gain legal custody of the older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared a living will , which describes specific life-prolonging medical treatment she does  --  or does n't  --  want if she becomes incapacitated . Schmook is having a tough time supporting the family now because Parks ' $256 weekly unemployment checks ran out in July and her only current income is $400 a month in child support . Still , he must face how he would manage the family finances after Parks is gone . Child care in the hospital where he works , for example , costs $130 a week " I can raise Gretchen alone , " he says , " but I wo n't be going on vacations . " He has $60,000 worth of term life insurance , supplied by his employer , as well as long-term disability coverage that would replace 60% of his income . Another benefit : a 403(b) retirement savings plan , under which he can contribute a maximum of $900 a year into an annuity . ( He does not yet participate . ) Park who late in July took off on a two-week camping trip to the Grand Canyon with Schmook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of plans . She 'll concentrate on her passion for cartooning , hoping to sell some drawings to newspapers and magazines ( see the example on page 89 ) . And she still wants to take Heather on a long-promised trip to Mexico or Florida to celebrate her 16th birthday in November . " I could sit in a corner and wait to die , " Parks says with a smile . " But what a waste of life . " THE ADVICE * Find an advocate . Even though Parks ' informal research into cancer treatments is valuable , she could benefit from professional advice . The Medical Care Ombudsman Program ( 301-657-0404 ) in Bethesda , Md. provides free assessment of treatment options from a volunteer panel of top doctors . And that could make a big difference . " For instance , " says Grace Powers Monaco , the program 's director , " if she is accepted into a transplant clinical trial , we can sometimes make insurers pay by pressuring them with our own medical recommendations . " * Immediately apply for Social Security disability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ACS Investment Advisors in Madison . You must wait five months to receive benefits after you stop working owing to disability or terminal illness ; Parks qualified as of July . ( The taxable monthly benefit amount , about $1,100 for Parks , is based on former salary and number of dependents . ) Once Parks dies , her three children will get roughly a third of that amount each until they turn 18 or graduate from high school . * Keep a heavy cash position . Because the Parks-Schmooks may need their $34,900 in cash over the next year to pay unreimbursed medical bills , they should make no other investments , says Madison family and money counselor Connie Kilmark . And although Schmook should be taking advantage of his company 403(b) savings plan , he should wait a while because of restrictions he 'd face if he needed the money soon . If Parks dies , Schmook should keep as much $15,000 , or six months ' salary , in cash for emergencies . For long-term growth , the remainder of his money belongs in a diversified portfolio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Axelrod . She favors growth and income fund Mutual Beacon ( no load ; up 14.3% for the 12 months to Aug. 1 ; 800-553-3014 ) and international fund SoGen Overseas ( 3.75% load ; up 13.9% since its inception on Sept. 1 , 1993 ; 800-334-2143 ) . Finally , Schmook needs to update his own life insurance coverage . An additional $200,000 of 15-year level term coverage would cost him a reasonable $270 a year at solid insurer First Colony ( 804-845-0911 ) . He should also update his will to name a guardian for Gretchen . Moreover , both Schmook and Parks should prepare living wills as soon as possible ( about $100 ) . Parks and Schmook agreed to apply for Social Security disability and prepare living wills soon . Parks also will contact the Medical Care Ombudsman Program . But the couple is still hesitant about the transplant procedure . To their relief , the chemo seems to be working : A July CAT scan showed the cancer to be in remission everywhere except in Parks ' liver . " The trick now is getting it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . <p>
