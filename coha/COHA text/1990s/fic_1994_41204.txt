The Moon Over Crete : Part Two <p> Lily could hardly keep her plans to herself all week . She was so distracted she forgot completely about a book report that was due Wednesday , and had to write it feverishly during lunch . <p> Finally , Saturday arrived . She took a shower , slipped a skirt into her backpack ( in Crete no one wore jeans ) , and bounded down the stairs . I 'm already Dad ! " she yelled . <p> Lily 's parents were sitting at the kitchen table with the newspaper spread out all over , nibbing dried peaches and sipping hot ginseng tea . <p> " Are n't you going to eat anything , Lily ? " her dad asked . " I just made some cherry-almond granola . " <p> Lily was too excited to eat . " Mrs. Zinn said I had to get to her house early today . " She grabbed the car keys from their hook and started toward the door . " I 'll be waiting in the car . " <p> " Lily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgetting something ? " <p> Lily turned around and mentally checked off the items in her backpack . Skirt , lucky arrowhead she 'd found on the playground , a paperback book called The Mystery of the Cauldron . " No , " she said . <p> " What about your flute ? " <p> Oh , yeah ! " Lily took the stairs two at a time , grabbed her instrument , and ran down again , jumping off the next-to-last step . <p> As they drove to Mrs. Zinn 's house . Dad asked , " So what 're you so excited about today ? " Is Mrs. Zinn planning a recital ? " <p> " No . " Lily tried to look a little less excited so Dad would n't get too suspicious . " Are n't the leaves pretty now ? " She knew this would distract her dad , since he really liked talking about fall laves . <p> They pulled up in front of Mrs. Zinn 's house . Lily flying the car door open and scrambled out . <p> " I 'll be back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the house . Lily stopped short , before she remembered that no matter how long a time-travel trip took , no time passed in the present . <p> Mrs. Zinn greeted her at the door in a flowing skirt and blouse . " I picked this up last time I was in ancient Crete , " Mrs. Zinn explained , as though she were talking about a trip to Europe . " We 'll get you into some real Cretan clothes once we get there . We 'll be staying with a dear friend of mine , whose daughter is about the same age as you are . Go put you skirt on - we may as well get started . " <p> Lily had n't realized they were going to be staying overnight . " How long will we be there fore ? " <p> " Oh ... it will seem like a few weeks , or even longer , but of course it wo n't be anytime at all . I have a few things I 'd like to do there . I was planning to go anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She went into the bathroom to change . But once the door was closed , instead of putting on her clothing she sat down on the toilet seat cover . A few weeks ! Or longer ! Even if it was n't any time at all , as Mrs. Zinn insisted , it would still seem like a long time to be far away from home . Should she decide not to go after all ? <p> Lily looked around at the neat bathroom , with matching peach-colored towels , rug , shower curtain , even peach-colored little soap 's shaped like shells . If she stayed home , how boring life would be , especially after discovering Mrs. Zinn 's secret . She wanted to go , even if she was scared a little . She jumped up , pulled off her jeans , and buttoned on her skirt and blouse . <p> " Mrs. Zinn ! " she called as she opened the door . " Can I ask you a question ? " <p> " Certainly , dear . " Mrs. Zinn was sitting calmly in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of skein of pale pink yarn . " My son 's wife is going to have a baby ! A little girl , " Mrs. Zinn smiled happily . " They have n't told me yet , but since I saw the child already I thought I might as well start on a few things for it . What did you want to ask her ? " <p> " Well ... if we get to Crete and I do n't like it ... I mean . I 'm sure I will , but if I do n't ... do you think we could come home sooner than a few weeks ? " <p> Mrs. Zinn laid her knitting in her lap and sat silently in thought several seconds . " Well , as I mentioned I was hoping to be there long enough to do a few things . If you fell ill . I would of course bring you home immediately . But if it were just homesickness - do you get homesick easily ? Because if you do , maybe we should wait for a shorter trip for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think of waiting . " I do n't think I 've ever gotten homesick , and I 've stayed with my grandparents lots of times by myself . I 'm sure I 'll be fine . " She smiled bravely . Her head was swimming and her heart beat rapidly . " <p> " Fabulous , " said Mrs. Zinn . " Then we 'll start . " She turned off the radio , pulled down the blinds , and settled back into her chair . She picked up the green stone seal from ancient Crete which she 'd shown Lily last week . " Sit right here next to me and hold my hand . Lily . Now close your eyes. , breath deeply , and try to make your mind blank . " She sounded just like Dad When he was trying to get Lily to meditate . <p> They sat in silence for a few minutes . The more Lily tried to make her mind blank , the more her thoughts wandered . She thought about the story Mrs. Zinn told about Crete , and about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and about how Mom said they were having pizza for dinner . Her nose itched , and the waistband of her skirt felt too tight . She even opened her eyes for a second and looked over at Mrs. Zinn . Her eyes were closed and she looked like she was asleep , except Lily knew she was n't from the tight grip she kept on Lily 's hand . Then - <p> Lily could n't describe how she was feeling - kind of like she had no body anymore . She could n't see or hear of feel anything , but still she somehow sensed she was being sucked or propelled through something very fast . She could n't tell how long it lasted . It was n't painful , but did n't feel good either , and Lily could n't wait to be done with it and be together again in one place . <p> Suddenly she could see , hear , and feel again . She and Mrs. Zinn were sitting on a beach , still holding hands . Mrs. Zinn laughed delightedly . " I did it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in amazement and little fear . The sky was a clear blue , and the sea sparkled with golden flecks of sunlight . The sand they were sitting on was pleasantly warm . It looked so normal Lily wondered whether Mrs. Zinn had n't transported them to California by mistake . Then she saw two people walking down the beach . They were both wearing very short skirts , and both had long dark hair flowing over their shoulders . Lily had never seen clothes like that before . To Lily 's surprise and embarrassment , they stripped off their skirts to reveal no clothes underneath , and she saw that one was a young man and one a young woman . They both ran laughing into the waves . <p> " Yes , I should have warned you that here in Crete , no one is very worried about clothing - they 'd sooner have it off than on ! " Mrs. Zinn laughed again and stood up to brush off her skirt . " Well , we may as well make our way to my friend Inasha . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works at the palace . " Mrs. Zinn started walking , and Lily jumped up to follow her . <p> They could see ships in the sea as they walked uphill , past neat orchards and homes . The houses all seemed to have lots of shaded porches , and clusters of building grouped together any which way . Lily saw people working in gardens , strumming instruments and singing , and playing with children . It was hard to tell if they were men or women sometimes because all worse their hair long , and many had on short skirts . Most of them looked at Lily and Mrs. Zinn and waved . <p> " Do n't they think it 's strange to see us here ? " asked Lily , surprised that people do n't stare at her . <p> " They 're used visitors . People are always sailing in from the lands we call Greece . Egypt , Turkey , the Middle East , and even England . But you can be sure they 'll find out who we are . With no TV or radio or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Mrs. Zinn laughed . <p> " What do you think of Crete to far ? " Mrs. Zinn asked . <p> Lily thought for a moment . " It seems so - modern ! All these building and ships and ... I thought you said we were going back in time a long way ! <p> Mrs. Zinn laughed . " Our culture owes a lot to the Cretans . Did you know the potter 's wheel was invented on this island ? And it 's my feeling that our American democracy would not be even as fair and equal as it is , if Crete had n't influenced Greek democracy ? <p> The pottery workshop was inside the palace . As they walked toward it . Lily saw that looked like horns protruding from the palace roof . " Those are sculptures of bull 's horns . " explained Mrs. Zinn . " The built is a sacred animal for the Cretans . " The palace was certainly large , but it a sacred animal for the Cretans . " The palace was certainly large , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or imposing , the way Lily imagined a place would be . In fact , it looked kind of funny with its horns sticking up like that . <p> Mrs. Zinn led Lily through hallways and rooms , and up and down stairs . Lily tried to remember the route they were taking , but she turned so many corners she could n't kept it straight . Finally they came to the workshop - a large , airy , light-filled room . Lilly gazed in silence at the dozen or more potters deftly forming vases , bowls , plates , cups , and other objects , which took shape under their fingers as the potter 's wheels whirled . Other people sat at desks by the windows , painting the formed and hardened pieces . Lily stepped quietly over to a painter and watched as the outlines of an octopus appeared on a pitcher , its eight long legs curled around the round shape . <p> Mrs. Zinn had found Inasha , and was now hugging her . They were both laughing and talking at the same time . Lily walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She especially liked one plate showing a monkey trying to catch butterflies , which were so colorful and vibrant they seemed almost ready to fly off the plate ! <p> Mrs. Zinn talked to Inasha for a long time , and Lily got bored . She saw a hallway near the bench she was sitting on . Should she explore ? She looked at Mrs. Zinn , who showed no intention of leaving . Lily stood up and ducked into the passageway . <p> It was dim , but she saw light ahead . She wandered down the hall , through a doorway , and into another hall . She heard voices , and followed the sounds into a large room with pillars . <p> Parents and children were resting , talking and playing . She looked hard at two children playing a game to decide if they were girls or boys . Both had long hair and flat chests , and were wearing short skits . She could n't decide with they were . It felt strange not knowing whether they were boys or girls , or one of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yawned and looked around . She decided to explore some more . But soon . In the large palace , she was completely lost with no idea how to find the pottery studio and Mrs. Zinn again . She listened carefully for voices to guide her back . Finally she heard some in the distance , and followed them . As they grew louder , she realized they were chanting or singing . <p> The chanting was coming through a doorway farther along the wall . Lily peeked inside . The singers seemed to be behind the curtains at the opposite end of the room . Should she go in further ? She looked over the shoulder . No one watching her , so she quickly stepped in . <p> It was dark , except for a tall lamp burning in the corner . Five or six women stood with their backs to Lily , singing . Lily was n't sure it was all right for her to be watching , and started to edge away from the doorway . Just then a woman with graying hair glanced at her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dim lamplight . She beckoned Lily to come in , and made a space for her in the semi-circle . <p> Lily hesitated . What was she getting herself into ? What would they expect her to do ? Would they discover she was n't a Cretan and punish her for intruding on their ceremony ? Before Lily could decide what to so , the woman reached out , took Lily 's hand , and pulled her gently forward into the space . <p> Lily 's eyes grew adjusted to the darkness , and she saw statues on the ledge in front of her , statues of women dressed in the same layered dresses these women were wearing . These goddesses seemed to be holding snakes in their upraised hands , or letting snakes crawl on them . But they did n't look alarmed at all . In fact , they were smiling brightly with their eyes open wide . Surrounding the idols were fruits , flowers , and shells . <p> Lily thought it was a lot like the Indian ceremonies she 'd seen her grandmother perform . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't take too long . Her grandmother 's always seemed to last forever ! A woman handed her a flask and motioned for her to pour a little of its contents into a bowl . Lily did so - it seemed to be oil , and it smelled like perfume . <p> After all the women had poured some oil , they stopped singing . That was the end of the ceremony , and as they filed out of the room they talked and laughed with each other . The woman who 'd pulled Lily in asked her a question . <p> " I do n't understand ! Lily said , trying to smile as politely as she could . She needed to get back to Mrs. Zinn and Inasha , but how could she get directions from these women ? Lily turned to the gray-haired woman and said . " Where is the pottery workshop ? " She made the shapes of a vase and a plate in the air with her hands . <p> But the woman just looked at her with a puzzled expression . Then Lily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inasha , I want to go where Inasha is . " <p> The woman repeated . " Inasha ? " , then started to the woman beside her , pointing to Lily . The second woman asked Lily a question , enunciating each word very slowly . Lily still did n't understand , of course . She looked around the courtyard for some kind of prop of clue , and she saw two children drawing on the paying stones with chalk . She ran over to them and held out her hand for a piece of chalk , which they gave her . Then she ran back to the two women and started drawing on the ground the vase with the octopus , she 'd seen . <p> " Aah ! Inasha ! " And the women started talking to each other rapidly . They stood up and led her out the courtyard and back into the maze of hallways and rooms . Soon she was back in the pottery workshops . Their entrance seemed to cause a commotion . The potters exclaimed and all got up to greet the women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for walking off by herself . " You could have been lost of days , " she said . " the palace is a very confusing place . You could have gotten into the storerooms and never been seen or heard from for weeks , even ! " Lily nodded , but could n't believed she 'd been in any danger . And if she had well , it was a better story to tell her friends when she got home ! But she had to admit she was very relieved to find Mrs. Zinn again . <p> Illustration ( Girl in a room with huge vase ) <p>
