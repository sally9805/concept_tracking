<p> ATLANTA - The Olympic Games evoke images of global fellowship , good sportsmanship , and tear-filled eyes watching flags rise up in patriotic salute to noble champions . <p> But if you 're talking about housing during the 1996 Olympic Games , the image hovering over Atlanta today is one of " money . " <p> A certain amount of basic greed is emerging because of a simple fact : 2 million people will be pouring into this city next summer , but Atlanta has only 55,000 hotel rooms . <p> Visitors have already booked every hotel room within 80 miles of downtown Atlanta . College dormitories , church gymnasiums and inner-city loft apartments are being converted into hostels during the Olympic siege . <p> Hotels as far away as Nashville , Tenn. - a five-hour drive - expect to get Olympic guests during the event , which runs from July 19 through Aug. 4 <p> To make up for the shortfall of hotel rooms , some Atlanta home-owners are renting out their houses during the Olympics , and demanding phenomenal prices . <p> For a mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlanta 's affluent Buckhead area for three weeks . <p> A more modest seven-bedroom , 6 1/2-bath home can be rented for $ 125,000 . That 's about one-tenth of what it would cost to buy the home . <p> Brokers hope that corporations will spring for the big bucks necessary to secure one of these behemoths . It 's billed as a great way to entertain your best clients and reward your top executives . <p> Earlier this month , a Coca-Cola executive from Albuquerque , N.M. , leased a $ 450,000 house in Conyers , just outside Atlanta . He 's paying $ 1,385 per night for seven nights for his family to use two bedrooms and two baths in the home . The deal includes valuable transportation to the games . <p> Sixty-three-year-old Dottie Taylor recently signed a deal to lease her three-bedroom home in suburban Alpharetta for $ 14,000 . <p> Taylor said she will remove from her home most of her personal items , clothes and photos of her family when she vacates to make room for the Olympic tenants . <p> " " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , " Taylor said . She 's paying an additional $ 25 to upgrade her insurance coverage , which will cover property damage and thefts . <p> But she 's a little worried because her tenants are from New Orleans , and she believes people from that city like to party . <p> " " If they spill bourbon or something on my carpet , I 'll just replace it . The insurance company knows this , " Taylor said . <p> Taylor and her husband , Wilbur , a 65-year-old medical equipment salesman , will spend the days of the Olympics in their log cabin in the Blue Ridge Mountains , far away from Atlanta 's bustle . They have n't decided how they will spend the windfall from the Olympic rental , but Dottie Taylor is dreaming of a plan to set sail on a cruise ship soon . <p> Not everybody who is renting out a home has a mountain cabin to flee to during the Olympics . <p> Some of the temporary Olympic landlords are moving in with relatives while their homes are rented . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move in with their next-door neighbors and split the rental revenues with them . <p> Other homeowners are becoming hoteliers , chauffeurs and chefs , using their own bedrooms , cars and kitchens and staying home as they operate short-term bed and breakfast operations during the Olympics . <p> Anne Treadwell , an enterprising Atlanta saleswoman , has organized a new company , Homeowners United Georgia 96 , to match Olympic tourists with Atlanta homeowners who want to operate temporary bed-and-breakfasts . <p> " " My homeowners do n't move out , they move over , " Treadwell said . <p> Providing transportation to the game venues is important because rental cars will be hard to get , and attendees will have to park in satellite parking lots miles away from the inner core of the Olympic venues , Treadwell said . <p> Drivers ' access to downtown will be extremely restricted . So Treadwell is encouraging her homeowner clients to include transportation as part of the bed-and-breakfast package . She said one homeowner recently purchased an extra large van with that in mind . <p> Henry Fisher , a 51-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by renting the bedrooms of his four-bedroom home in suburban Duluth , Ga. , during the Olympics . <p> Fisher plans to sleep in the recreation room of his home , while guests are upstairs in the bedrooms . " " We thought it was a good opportunity to make some extra bucks while also meeting some people from across the waters , " said Fisher , who lives about 22 miles north of downtown . <p> Mel Davidson , owner of a seven-bedroom mansion on 12.5 acres in Conyers , knows that he could score big during the Olympics , if a corporation comes along to rent his entire home during the games . <p> His home could provide parking for 80 cars , and it has plenty of large rooms and places to seat a sizable banquet party . <p> Davidson does n't want to estimate how much he could make , but he knows it 's a lot . He is skeptical about estimates that some may pay more than $ 100,000 to rent his home . <p> " " I do n't know of anyone who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing , " Davidson said . But his house is on the market just the same . <p> Homeowners pay hefty commissions to be a part of the gold rush . <p> The officially sanctioned Private Housing 1996 , a coalition of area Realtor and apartment trade groups , requires homeowners to pay a 45 percent commission for leasing services . <p> Then , competition arose . Independent realty companies jumped into the fray . <p> Most of them are charging 30 to 35 percent commissions , said Robert Locke , owner of Crown Management , an Atlanta property manager that is heavily involved in Olympic rentals . <p> The response from Atlanta homeowners wanting to rent has been overwhelming at times . <p> " " We had 400 phone calls this afternoon , " Locke said a few hours after an appearance on an Atlanta lunch-hour television show . <p> Locke 's firm has been getting phone calls from potential guests from across the nation and around the world , but leasing was slow until after the Christmas holidays , when activity began improving considerably , Locke said . Leasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Private Housing 1996 has already booked $ 5 million of rentals in private homes and apartments , said D.W. " " Dusty " Rhoades , executive vice president of the group . More than 1,500 apartment units and 500 single-family homes already have been rented through Private Housing , which requires a minimum stay of six nights . <p> Prices generally range from $ 150 per bedroom per night to $ 300 per room per night , Rhoades said . <p> There is no ordinance governing potential price gouging in renting private homes during the Olympics , but laws have been enacted to control hotel rates , Rhoades said . <p> If you want to get a hotel room in Atlanta , forget it . They have been booked for months . But that does n't stop people from trying . <p> " " I would guess we get at least 100 calls a day , " said Greg Brown , manager of the 1,200-room Atlanta Hilton . " " We get faxes every day from Hilton properties overseas . " All Brown can do is say " " no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room elsewhere . <p> Olympic regulars will soon learn that Los Angeles , which has 93,000 hotel rooms , had a much bigger inventory of hotels to offer for the 1984 Olympics than does Atlanta . <p> For Atlanta 's Olympics , even hotels in neighboring states are booking up . <p> In Chattanooga , Tenn. , the 361-room Chattanooga Choo-Choo Holiday Inn is already 60 percent booked during the Olympics , said Bob Doak , general manager of the hotel , which is 125 miles north of Atlanta . <p> " " We 've got a large group of Asians and Middle Easterners staying at our hotel , " Doak said . <p> He said his rates are " " slightly above " the hotel 's 1995 average rate in the high $ 90s . He declined to elaborate , but he said the hotel was not gouging . <p> " " We are not taking advantage of the once-in-the-lifetime Olympics in Atlanta , " Doak said . <p> The Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games has filed a lawsuit against at least one Atlanta hotel that was accused of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's committed to snuffing out gouging before it begins . <p> Outrage erupted last year when an Atlanta apartment landlord , Intown Properties , began to get what was diagnosed as an aggressive case of Olympic greed . <p> The landlord reportedly notified tenants they could either agree to sublease their apartments during the Olympics - with furniture in place and the utilities on - or they could pay $ 3,000 per month in rent for their modest apartments . <p> In the face of bad publicity and public pressure , the landlord backed down , said Dan Boling of the Atlanta Tenants Rights Association . <p> Some apartment owners have been raising rents or declining to give long-term leases , and the tenants association suspects that landlords are scheming to create apartment vacancies that can be turned into Olympic gold . <p> Boling , 33 , said he is being hit with an $ 85 rent hike for his one-bedroom unit , and that is forcing him to consider moving out from the apartment complex where he has lived for seven years . <p> " " At first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Boling said . " " Now I 'm losing my home because the city has the Olympics coming to town . "
