PETERSON KILLED THE DOG on a cold windy Tuesday afternoon . He shot it in its own front yard for no other reason than that he did n't like dogs . And he laughed as we came running from kitchens and garages and back yards to find out what had happened . He laughed at Kelli Horoshi , the girl Elizabeth hired to walk Seaboy in the afternoons while she worked , laughed at her as she knelt on the damp ground and cried , holding Seaboy 's head , and trying to stop the bleeding with the thin tail ends of her shirt . <p> The police came , shook their heads , and took Peterson downtown in handcuffs . He walked to the patrol car with a smirky kind of grin on his face . Kelli Horoshi 's mother came too and took her home . Kelli could n't stop crying and she kept apologizing . " I 'm sorry . I could n't help it . " And we could n't tell if she was apologizing because she could n't stop crying or because Seaboy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with the body , so I ended up sitting on the front lawn beside it until Elizabeth came home . <p> She could see right away that something was wrong  --  me sitting there like that with Seaboy on the ground not moving  --  but she pulled all the way up to the garage before she stopped the car . She turned the engine off and sat there looking straight ahead . <p> After what seemed like a long long time , but was probably only a couple of minutes , she came and looked down at him . He was stiff and he did n't look real somehow with the life gone out of him . I 'd always thought of him as noble , though I was n't much of a dog person myself . He was big for a Doberman Pinscher , which Elizabeth said was a fault , but which I thought made him fine . He would stand sometimes on her porch in the summer twilight , listening . His whole body seemed alert , ears pricked , eyes bright , nose quivering , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had looked a little out of place  --  as did cool and elegant Elizabeth herself  --  in our aging neighborhood of weathered bungalows and Prairie-style two-stories with wide , shaded overhangs . He looked like a prince standing at the entrance to his castle , surveying his territory with indulgence and serenity . <p> " What happened ? " Elizabeth 's voice was calm , but I knew how much she had loved that dog . <p> " Elizabeth , I 'm sorry  --  " <p> " What happened ? " <p> Even when I told her , her expression did n't change . " Thank you for staying with him , " she said when I finished . Then , she turned and walked into the house . <p> I stood there with my shoulders hunched against the wind . What was I supposed to do now ? I looked at Seaboy . Three years ago , I 'd lost my husband when he wrapped our new Buick around a telephone pole . It had n't been anyone 's fault , except maybe his own  --  too many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him anyway , the bum , and if he 'd died like Seaboy had , in cold blood , just like that , well , I ca n't even imagine how that would feel . Of course , Seaboy was just a dog . And like I said , I 'm not a dog person . But still ... <p> Elizabeth returned . She 'd changed into faded blue jeans , an old flannel shirt , work boots and gloves . Her graying blond hair was still bound in the smooth chignon that she usually wore to work and it made a stark contrast to the faded utility of her clothes . The akin around her eyes looked as if it had been stretched tight . She carried a blanket which she laid on the ground beside Seaboy . She walked to the other side and squatted down beside him . She put one hand out and rested it for a moment on his shoulder . I almost cried . <p> A car drove by up on the main road , honking its horn at something or other , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunched , then she straightened , and I never saw her falter again . She put both hands under Seaboy 's body , rolled him onto the blanket , and started dragging him into the back yard . <p> I knew she did n't want me there . This was something private , and she was a very private person . But I could n't bear the thought of it , that she would have no one . I grabbed the other end of the blanket and followed her . <p> It took two hours to dig the hole we buried Seaboy in . She chose a spot in the very back of the big yard , underneath a huge old sycamore tree . When we finished it was long past dark . My fingers were numb from holding the flashlight and my face felt like a block of ice . <p> " Come up to the house , " Elizabeth said as she straightened and brushed dirt off her jeans , " I 'll make coffee . " <p> There was a bright comfort about Elizabeth 's kitchen with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Warmth began to seep back into my bones . The afternoon 's events seemed surreal , unable to compete with the ordinary smells of brewing coffee and lemon-scented cleaner . I kept expecting to see Seaboy in his usual place on the woven blue rug near the sink . <p> Elizabeth poured two mugs of coffee , handed one to me and sat down . She seemed unable to settle . She kept looking at the leashes and collars hung neatly beside the door . Finally , she rose , walked into the back room , and returned with a large box . She stripped the leashes from the rack with Seaboy 's name engraved on it . <p> " Elizabeth , " I began , but she was already gone . I followed her into the study where she had opened the doors of the secretary desk . With great care and gentleness , she removed Seaboy 's obedience ribbons , his tracking plaques , and his two high-in-trial trophies . " You do n't have to do this now , " I said , wishing I had followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , " I do . " She went to the kitchen for a roll of tape , put it on top of the box and carried the whole thing up to the attic . I looked around the study , closed the secretary doors which she had left standing open , and , because I could n't think what else to do , I followed her . <p> I found Elizabeth kneeling on the attic floor trying to tape the box closed . She was crying , brushing the tears angrily away as fast as they could fall . <p> " Let me help , " I said , kneeling beside her . I held the flaps together while she taped them down . She taped the lid both ways twice . She taped around the sides three times . She taped every seam until the dispenser ran dry . Then she sat back and looked at it without speaking . <p> " It 's not  --  " I began . <p> She threw the empty tape dispenser across the room . The sound as it crashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stood up . <p> " Why would he do it ? " She starred to pace , ten steps to one side of the attic , ten steps back to the center of the room . " Why ? " <p> " I do n't  --  " <p> She turned and faced me . " There was no reason . It was brutal and mean and there was no reason for it . And what 's going to happen to him ? " She was pacing again . " What ? Nothing . Not really . A fine , maybe ? A couple of months in jail ? Community service ? A little inconvenience for him and it 's over . " <p> I put my hand on the landing rail and rose . " That 's about what happened last time , " I agreed . <p> She stopped again . " Last time ? " <p> I dusted off one of her trunks with my handkerchief and sat down . " Maybe that was before you moved here . He Shot the Donalds ' cat with a bow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fined him five hundred dollars for cruelty to animals and made him pay the Donalds one hundred dollars to buy another cat , but that was it . And there was that other time too , when Mrs. O'Shane 's poodle drowned . We could never prove it was him , but ... " <p> Elizabeth looked fierce . " Why do you let him ? " <p> " Let him ? We ca n't do anything . What can we do ? I mean , we call the police . I 'm always the first one to call the police whenever there 's any trouble . " I was breathing a little hard and I was glad that Elizabeth turned away and started stacking boxes to make room for the new one . We 'd never had cross words before , but she had a kind of nerve , even allowing for her loss . The rest of us knew better than to keep pets in Peterson 's neighborhood . <p> " Look , " she said a moment later as I was trying to decide if I should just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held up a small lidded box . She carried it to the trunk , set it down and opened the lid . " These belonged to my mother . I 'd forgotten they were up here . " She pulled out a small crystal ball and blew dust from it . For a second the crystal seemed to glow , but she set it down and I realized that it was just a reflection from the dusty naked bulb above us . She pulled out a deck of cards . " Tarot cards , " she said . She pulled other items , one after another . " Runes . I Ching . " She pulled almost a dozen items from the small box . " My mother believed in all of this , you know . She 'd read auras at parties . She talked to ghosts . " Elizabeth 's voice seemed affectionate and I remember thinking how odd ! Tarot and auras and crystal balls seemed more likely to embarrass someone like her , so cool and rationally self-controlled . <p> " What 's that ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smooth blue stone with white and purple veins running through it . As she cupped it in her hand the veins seemed to shift beneath her fingers , flowing into new patterns initiated by the heat from her palm . " It 's a tally stone . " She stood . <p> " What does it do ? The stone , I mean . " I had a vague idea about the other things , the tarot and the runes and things , but I 'd never heard of a tally stone . <p> " It 's a tally stone , " she repeated . " It keeps count . " <p> " Of what ? " <p> She looked at it intently . She rolled it over in her hand . It looked to me like a perfect oval . On one side an almost solid streak of purple cut through the smaller , more delicate veins of white and gray and purple . " It keeps a count of everything " she said . " When the counts are skewed , the tally stone can help right them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at it in the light . " There are prices to be paid . But for those willing to pay them , the tally stone can be a powerful equalizer . " She slipped it into her shirt pocket and walked over to the window . <p> " Of course , " she said as she leaned her head against the glass , " that 's only legend . It 's not the truth . The truth is that someone can shoot your dog in your own front yard and you ca n't stop them . " <p> She walked me out , turning on the porch light before we stepped outside . I looked across the front lawn . Shadows hid the spot where Seaboy had lain and I wondered if we 'd see it for a long time , a huge black splotch like an open wound to remind us every day until the snow came that he 'd died there . <p> I looked back at Elizabeth , meaning to comfort her in some way that was n't clear to me yet , but she was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the street . Her eyes , usually a light golden green , looked darker , almost black in the oddly shadowed porch light . " As if it means nothing , " she said . <p> I turned , and sure enough , lights were coming on three houses up across the street at Peterson 's . " Elizabeth , do n't ... " But she was already off the porch and down the sidewalk . I followed , feeling as if I were in the middle of some disaster movie , but not really able to stop . <p> She walked right up to his front door and knocked on the aluminum storm door as if she were paying a routine social call . I stayed back in the yard , just out of the sickly yellow circle cast by the single grimy porch light . I was joined after a few minutes by Mrs. O'Shane , Peterson 's immediate neighbor , who had told me last year that she never worked in her hack yard anymore unless Peterson was n't home . He sat on the back steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she ever built a fence he 'd burn it down . John Horoshi , Kelli 's father , joined us , along with a couple of others . No one spoke ; I do n't even remember breathing . If they all felt like I did , then we felt we should be doing something to support Elizabeth . But Peterson was vengeful ; he could make our lives hell without ever doing anything so bad the courts would hold him , and nothing we did would bring Seaboy back again . <p> Elizabeth knocked again . I could hear faint sounds , like a television turned up loud . There were lights on in the living room and upstairs in the front bedroom . I do n't know why , but I thought maybe it would all go away , everything would go back to normal , if he would just not answer the door . I may have even prayed . <p> Elizabeth pounded on the door frame with her fist , determined more than angry . I could see , then , that she would stand there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there until one way or another Peterson came outside . <p> The front door flung open . Peterson glared through the rusty screen . <p> When he saw who it was , he grinned and opened the storm door partway , leaning against the jamb with his arms crossed and one foot holding the door . <p> " You shot my dog , " she said to him , and the wind must have been blowing just right because all of us could hear every word , crystal-clear . <p> Peterson looked at her . His eyes flickered out to the yard . I did n't think he could see our faces , just shadowy figures waiting , like ghouls at a traffic accident . " Yah , " he said , " it was barkin ' . Like to bark all the time  --  yap , yap , yap  --  nearly drove me out my skull . " <p> " No , " she said , " he did n't . " <p> " What ? " <p> " He did n't bark . He never barked except occasionally when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment I thought he might take her seriously . Then his smirk returned . " Hah ! " he said as he waved a hand , dismissing her , and took a step back into the house . She grabbed his wrist and she must have been stronger than she looked because it stopped him for a moment . He glared at her , then he jerked his arm away and the screen door slammed . <p> I held my breath , but Elizabeth did n't do anything else , just turned and walked away . <p> I did n't see her after that for several days . We were neighbors and we were nearly the same age  --  though Elizabeth looked years younger than I did , she ran twenty miles a week . But beyond that , we did n't have much in common . Elizabeth taught history at the university and had never married ; I was a widow who had n't gone past high school , worked three days a week at the hospital as a volunteer organizer , and did n't read much beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my grandchildren brought home from school . I supposed it was hard for her . She 'd done everything with that dog  --  Rose Hill 's Certain Victory , CDX , UDX , and a bunch of other letters I could n't remember  --  Seaboy 's real name . They 'd gone to obedience trials , tracking tests , nursing home visits . My grandson , Pete , said that she and Seaboy had visited his second grade classroom last year to talk about pet care and responsibility . They 'd been in the back yard every evening . She 'd throw a tennis ball for him to retrieve ; they 'd play tug-of-war with an old towel tied in knots . And in between , she would work with him on jumps and tunnels and dumbbell retrieves and precision heeling . They went running every couple of days . I wondered what she was going to do now that he was gone . <p> Monday around six , I came home from grocery shopping and saw her sitting on her front porch . The weather had improved in the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped for a moment with my three bags of groceries  --  not much to buy now that Jake and the kids were gone . " How are you doing ? " I called across the drive , though I had a feeling she hated that question . When she was sick last year an.d I had brought her chicken soup and done some grocery shopping for her , I could see the muscles in her face and the skin across her cheekbones tighten when I asked her . The problem was , I could n't help saying it . What else did you say ? <p> She looked at me . " Fine , " she said and went back to what she 'd been doing tapping something against her knee and staring up the street at Peterson 's house . <p> I went on home and put my groceries away , but I could n't relax , thinking about her sitting over there in the dusky twilight . I washed the supper dishes . The sun faded from the sky and the temperature continued to drop . I put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dishtowels upstairs , folded them , and put them away . Every five minutes I 'd look out the window , hoping she 'd gotten up and gone inside . Finally , I fixed some hot chocolate in a thermos and went over there to talk to her . <p> She had donned a down vest , hiking boots with heavy socks , and fingerless wool gloves along with her blue jeans and sweater . She did n't look cold . She did n't look as if she even realized that she was sitting outside instead of in her living room . In her right hand she held the tally stone , rolling it over and over in the palm of her hand . <p> " Elizabeth ? " <p> She looked over at me and smiled , accepting the hot chocolate when I poured it for her . She gestured for me to sit down . The advanced twilight had turned everything to grays and blues including the air between us . <p> " How are you ? " Like I said , I ca n't help it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was never really brave , you know . My entire life I never risked myself . If a situation arose , I would stand at the back of the crowd waiting for someone else to act . If I was alone I froze , like a rabbit in the open . If you 're quiet , if you stay in the background and you never take chances , you can live a safe , comfortable life without ever really acknowledging that you have no courage . " <p> She took a sip of her hot chocolate . " But then I got Seaboy , and he changed me . I was brave . Not because he was a big dog with powerful jaws and protective instincts ; I was brave for him . Because he needed me . When teenaged boys jeered and threw rocks at us in the park I confronted them . When a man tried to grab my purse in a parking lot one Friday evening and Seaboy was with me , I clobbered him in the head with my shoulder bag . Do you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , that the police would come , that he 'd be labeled vicious  --  they do n't like Dobermans here  --  and I would lose him . He gave me everything he had  --  loyalty and attention and faithfulness  --  protection from harm was something I thought I could give in return . <p> " But all that , all the bravery , standing up for him so his life would be , I do n't know  --  joyous , it all came down to nothing . " She looked at me . " He must have been afraid , do n't you think , when he died ? He must have wondered where I was , what all the blood was , what was happening . When it really counted , out there , I could n't protect him . " <p> I did n't know what to say . What could I say ? I 'm sorry your dog is dead ? Well , I was , but what good would it do to say it ? " They 'll punish him this time , do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long pause before she spoke , I heard a storm door slam down the street , I heard a car start up , and two separate train whistles on opposite sides of town . " They arraigned him this morning , " Elizabeth said when she finally spoke . " He pleaded guilty . He stood up and said he was guilty and they fined him a thousand dollars . " <p> " They must have given him some jail time . Or community service . " I knew I sounded desperate . It seemed as if it would be everyone 's fault , mine , the police , Mrs. O'Shane down the street , if there were n't , somehow , justice for Seaboy . " There must have been something besides a fine . " <p> " Thirty days . Served on weekends . For discharging a firearm within city limits . " Her voice was as calm as ever . It had never sounded so bleak . <p> " Oh , Elizabeth . I 'm sorry . " <p> " Yes . So am I. " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I had just turned off Ash and was driving up our street when I saw the first one . It was trotting right down the middle of the street , but it must have heard the car because I had just started to slow when it swung its head around , looked at me , and trotted off at an angle to the grassy curb . I slowed the car further . Seaboy had been the only dog in the neighborhood before he got shot , so it had to be a stray . I stopped the car . It was a small dog , maybe ten pounds or so and it looked like a poodle , but its coat was fluffy all over , not cut with those funny balls on the legs and tail . It had a cute face , a little short nose , little pink tongue hanging out . I realized that it was heading in the direction of Peterson 's house and I got out of my car , thinking I could at least catch it and take it to the animal shelter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooting another dog . <p> When I opened the car door , the dog turned and looked at me again . It had dark round eyes and it cocked its head for a moment , looking at me with curiosity and intelligence . I whistled , but it ignored me . When I took a couple of steps toward it , it took off into the hedge between two houses . Fine , I thought . I was too old to be scrambling on my knees through hedges for a dog too dumb to stay home . I clumped back to the car . <p> I had gotten into the habit of taking Elizabeth a thermos of hot chocolate every night around seven . Every evening , she sat on her porch watching Peterson 's house . I worried about her ; it made me nervous to have her sitting out there , as if none of us could pretend that things in the neighborhood were normal as long as she was outside reminding us . Taking her the thermos was something . At least , when I came back home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said as I approached her , " it 's really starting to cool off , is n't it ? First thing you know we 'll have a frost and snow and we wo n't believe we were sitting outside clear into October . " I had , finally , stopped asking her how she was doing . Pretending things were normal was now the best that I could do . <p> Elizabeth did n't answer . Instead , she rose from her chair and walked to the porch railing . " Look , " she said and pointed with her gloved right hand , which also , I noticed , held the tally stone . <p> Across the street in the clear bright circle cast by the streetlight I saw two small white dogs  --  they looked just like the one I 'd seen earlier - trotting up the street . " Do you know whose they are ? " I asked . <p> " Yes , " she said , " I do . " But she made no move to leave the porch . <p> " Should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headed toward Peterson 's house . " <p> She did n't answer , just watched them . They looked like patches of white in the dark shadows across the street . I cleared my throat . <p> " I think they 're fine , " she said . <p> That first night there were only about six of them . They sat on the sidewalk in front of Peterson 's house for an hour . They did n't move much . They did n't bark . A little after eight o'clock they hopped up without ever having made a sound and trotted away . I do n't know that Peterson even knew that they had been there . The lights were on in the living room and in a couple of other rooms in the house . The porch light was on . But Peterson never came near the front door . <p> The next night they were back . They came back every night for a week and each time there were more of them . I would see them around seven when I walked across the yard to Elizabeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no cares in the world . They were cute little things . They 'd sit for an hour or sometimes a little longer in a half-circle in front of Peterson 's porch . There were enough of them now that they sat in two rows waiting for something Peterson , I suppose , but he had n't appeared yet and the dogs kept returning . <p> Everyone watched them . Mrs. O'Shane would put on her navy blue wool coat , the one she wore to church on Sundays , and come outside onto her front porch . The Horoshis would slide the curtains open on the big bay window in their living room and turn off the lights . No one called animal control or the police . I 'm sure no one thought it was normal . But why were they here ? <p> " They look so serious sitting there , " I said one night to Elizabeth . They 'd been outside Peterson 's house by then every night for seven nights . <p> Elizabeth watched them . " They 're Bichons , you know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " They spend their lives as someone 's fluffy lap dog  --  they 're descended from the water spaniel , they used to go on boats  --  when they die , they die pissed off that no one ever took them seriously . " <p> I looked at her . Was she kidding ? I could see Mrs. O'Shane up the street on her porch . Once again , there were lights on in Peterson 's house , but he was nowhere to be seen . <p> Elizabeth sat up . " This has gone on long enough , do n't you think ? " she said as she stood and walked to the porch railing . <p> " This ? " I wondered if she had always been odd . I wondered if I had just never noticed . I picked up the thermos and started to unscrew the top . " What do you mean , ' gone on long enough ? ' What ? " <p> She did n't answer . At that moment , as I was unscrewing the cap from the thermos , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the two curved rows of fluffy white dogs sitting in front of Peterson 's house began to howl . <p> I almost dropped the thermos . I 'd heard dogs howl before . When Seaboy was a puppy he had howled at night in his puppy crate and I 'd been able to hear him through my bedroom window . Mrs. O'Shane 's poodle had howled sometimes when she left him home alone . But this ... I 'd never heard any sound so awful and yet so wild . There were so many of them that it went on and on . When one dog drew breath another one picked up . I expected fog to start rising from the ground . I expected the moon to drift behind clouds and a chill north wind begin to blow . <p> None of that happened , but Peterson finally did come outside . From Elizabeth 's porch I could hear the screen door slam . " Hey ! " I heard him yell that , but the rest was lost in the wild howling . I could see him gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept on howling . He came down off the porch . He clumped down the walk and swung back his foot to kick at the nearest one . <p> I suppose his heavy boots and his denim jeans kept him from being more seriously injured when they attacked him . I suppose all of us  --  me , the Horoshis , Mrs. O'Shane , and Elizabeth  --  were too surprised by the whole thing to take any action . I know that I stood there and watched them swarm around him like tiny sheep gone mad . I watched him kick and snarl at them as he stumbled back up the walk onto the porch . He kicked the last one clean into the porch balustrade . I could hear the crack clear up at Elizabeth 's . <p> When he got the door open and got into the house , there was silence . The only sound on the entire street was the rustle of leaves as a breeze moved through the trees . One by one the little Bichons picked themselves up and shook themselves . One of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the porch supports , nudged him with its nose , then took a step backward as if not sure what to do next . The other dog , the one Peterson had kicked , lay there so Still . Like Seaboy , I thought . Then , it popped up too , shook itself like the others , as if it was shedding water , and trotted down the porch steps . Together , all of them trotted up the street away from us . They were out of sight by the time Peterson came back out the front door with his shotgun . He fired it into the air anyway and shouted something that I could n't hear . <p> After that the dogs changed . They were bolder , for one thing . One of them stared me down in my car the next evening . When I opened the door to shoo it away , it growled at me with its lips curled right back . <p> That night and the next night the dogs howled ; Peterson roared out the front door with his shotgun . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at them , fired until the gun was empty , then went back inside . The dogs picked themselves up ( I swear , even the ones that had been shot  --  at least , we never found them lying out there ) and trotted away . <p> After the third time , the police came and talked to Peterson on his front porch for a long time . They took his shotgun with them when they left . I figured he had more . <p> The following night it was cold with a hard frost wind blowing through the trees . I stayed inside and watched the street from my living room window . I could n't see her , but I was sure that Elizabeth was outside sitting on her porch . It seemed like what Elizabeth did , sit on her porch , as if that 's what she 'd always done and we 'd never known different . The dogs came , trotting down the street like always . They bounced up and down like puppets on strings ; the wind blew their little fluffy ears straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a sense of purpose maybe , that made me think of Seaboy when I saw them . <p> They sat , like they always did , in front of Peterson 's . They howled . But tonight Peterson did n't come out . After about fifteen minutes ( I thought I 'd go mad from the howling . Like I said it just went on and on and on ) I could see the dogs shifting as if they were getting restless waiting for Peterson . One would pop up while the others kept howling . It would trot to another spot in the line and sit down , then another one would do it . <p> Mrs. O'Shane was out on her porch . I could n't really see her from where I was standing  --  her coat and her scarf were too dark  --  but occasionally I could see movement , like the tiny white blur of her face , when she shuffled her feet or turned away from the wind . <p> The dogs must have noticed her too . Suddenly , they stopped howling and turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was  --  and looked at her . They did n't rash her , not like they attacked Peterson . I wondered at the time if they only did it because Peterson did n't come outside when they howled . <p> Whatever the reason , they started to move toward her . <p> You could say Mrs. O'Shane should have just walked back inside her house . But it 's different sitting here after everything 's over . It 's different . If I 'd been outside that night , if I 'd been at the end of my porch a good ten feet from the door and had two dozen little snarling dogs suddenly stalking me ... well I 'm not sure I would n't have frozen too . <p> I could n't hear anything through my closed windows except the rising rush of the wind . Across the street Janet Donald stood in her living room with the back of her hand to her mouth . The first dog was almost to Mrs. O'Shane 's front steps . She had n't moved . I wanted to shout at her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved , except those little white dogs advancing steadily toward Mrs. O'Shane . <p> Suddenly , Elizabeth was out there running toward them . She stopped when she reached the front yard , hesitated for a moment as if she were trying to make up her mind about something , then she walked up the front walk . When she reached the advancing dogs they parted before her like Moses and the sea , closing ranks again as she passed . <p> It was hard to see every detail from my living room . There were several trees , four yards , and the street between my house and Mrs. O'Shane 's , but I saw Elizabeth go over to her and I think she spoke to her . What I could see was that after a moment Elizabeth took her by the arm and walked with her back to the front door . They talked briefly in the doorway , then Mrs. O'Shane went inside . <p> When Elizabeth stepped off the porch , the dogs parted again . I watched her walk up the street . As she passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , popped to their feet , turned in unison , and trotted away . <p> I rose early the next morning , dressed , ate a quick breakfast , and went next door to Elizabeth 's determined to find out what was happening . Fluffy small dogs terrorizing Peterson had been one thing . <p> When she opened the door I could n't help noticing how pale and drawn she looked , as if she were recovering from a long illness . Though she was as neat and well-groomed as ever , there were new lines at the corners of her mouth and I noticed as I sat at the kitchen table watching her make coffee that whenever she was n't using them her fingers drummed constantly against the countertop . <p> After she had served me coffee , poured a cup of her own , and sat down at the table opposite me , I took a deep breath . " I want to know what 's going on . " <p> Elizabeth poured cream into her cup from a small rooster-shaped pitcher . " What do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs coming from ? " <p> " Does it make a difference where they 're from ? " <p> I looked at her . Somehow , despite her finely etched features , her pale skin , her smoothly styled hair and manicured hands , she looked fierce , as if I had asked something unspeakably foolish . I sat up straighter . What was wrong with asking ? What was wrong with wanting the neighborhood back to normal ? " This ca n't go on . I mean , it really ca n't . " I tried to sound calm , yet forceful when I spoke , the way we sometimes had to talk to stubborn , semi-lucid patients at the hospital . " I know it 's not my place to speak for everyone , but , my god , Elizabeth , they almost attacked Mrs. O'Shane last night . " <p> Elizabeth sank back against her chair . The sharp lines around the comers of her eyes seemed to fade a little . She opened her mouth as if to speak , but then something caught her eye over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the motion so quick and sharp that the legs of the chair squeaked on the floor . She walked to the double window above the sink and looked across the back yard . " What I 'm doing is something that should have been done a long time ago . " She turned back to face me . " You can say he was just a dog . In fact , that 's probably what you do say when you get together . Well , he was just a dog , but ... " She hesitated and some of the anger seemed to go out of her . " He taught me everything good I know about love and courage and faithfulness . I do n't care what anyone says . Things are out of balance here . " <p> I waited before I spoke . I could hear the second hand on the clock above the sink ticking . I could hear a branch from the overgrown hydrangea bush in the back yard scrape against the house . I tried to make my voice as gentle as possible because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night ? What about Mrs. O'Shane ? You never intended to hurt Mrs. O'Shane . " <p> She came back across the room and sat at the table . The fierceness had faded and though she still looked determined , she seemed more like the old Elizabeth , bent on an intellectual exercise . " Yes , well , something happened . " She reached into her shirt pocket and drew out the stone . As she talked , she tapped it on the table . " The tally stone does n't care about right and wrong , you know . It cares about balance and it cares about strength . With enough strength , enough power , a new balance can be forced . I did n't think that strength would matter because Peterson would n't know , you see . He would n't realize what was happening and he would n't have the knowledge or ability to counterattack . Last night ... well , I was wrong about Peterson . " <p> " He did that ? " <p> " Yes . But it wo n't happen again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I thought , how odd , that I take all this for granted . But then , there was the evidence night after night . " Is n't that what you do ? Use them ? " <p> She looked stricken . " I do n't . I do n't use them . I asked each of them if they would do it . They all wanted to . They 've known Petersons . Some of them , all they ever knew all their lives were people like Peterson . People who hit them or bred them until they bled to death or threw them out car windows and crushed their skulls . " <p> " They 're dead ? All of them are dead ? " <p> Elizabeth 's eyes narrowed slightly . " They 're ghosts . I thought you knew that . " <p> This time I was the one who rose and started pacing the kitchen . " I do n't know anything . This is n't normal . Everything that 's happened to me my whole life has been normal . Nothing odd has ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my chest and faced her . " Okay ? " <p> " Okay . They 're ghosts . The tally stone gives me that power  --  to call on ghosts if I want to . Or demons . Both sides of the balance sheet are there . Peterson could call on demons now . He could do anything . Now more than ever I have to finish it . Do you see ? " <p> " But , " I said and I could feel a cold breeze against the back of my neck . " The dogs . I still do n't see . What if they go after Mrs. O'Shane again ? What if they go after someone else ? " <p> Elizabeth sighed and I had the feeling she thought I was being dense again . Well , damn her anyway for bringing dead dogs into the neighborhood . Who asked her to make Peterson angry ? " They wo n't do that again , " she said . <p> " They did it last night , " I snapped . " They went after Mrs. O'Shane pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs , " Elizabeth said . " They 're just ... dogs . They do n't reason the way that you or I do . They thought it was me directing them to Mrs. O'Shane 's porch . Now they know better . They wo n't be fooled again . Do n't you see that ? " <p> I did n't answer . What was I going to say ? Why yes , Elizabeth , now I see . It 's all so clear now . I feel much better . Well , I did n't feel better . It was still odd and weird and scary . It was n't normal . <p> " Helen , " Elizabeth said after a short pause . " I 'm sorry . I am . I 'd stop it if I could . But it 's gone too far now . I have to finish it . " She rose and left the room . I could hear her footsteps as she climbed the stairs . <p> That night I invited the entire street  --  except Peterson , of course - to my house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safer together . I invited Elizabeth too , but I did n't really expect her to come . <p> Mrs. O'Shane said as she removed her scarf and navy blue coat in the entryway , " There are Dobermans out tonight . I saw them on the way over . " <p> I had just settled Mrs. O'Shane in the living room when the doorbell rang again . It rang twice more in rapid succession as I hurried down the hall . I opened the door to the Horoshis , the last arrivals . They surged into the house . Once in the entryway , Kelli grabbed my arm and pointed . " Look , " she said urgently . <p> " The Dobermans ? " I peered into the thickening dusk . " Mrs. O'Shane already told me . " <p> " No ! No , look . There 's something else out there . " Out of the corner of my eye I could see Mr. Horoshi nodding . Mrs. Horoshi huddled against him , shivering . " See , " Kelli insisted . " In the shadows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wishing I 'd had my eyes checked last month when I was supposed to . Then I saw it . It was n't really anything . It was shadow and darkness , but it moved . Independent of the wind , oblivious to the play of light from the streetlamps , it drifted down the street . I pulled Kelli all the way inside and slammed the door . <p> No one really wanted coffee and dessert , but I served it anyway . I had a fire in the fireplace  --  it really was a cold night that night  --  and it seemed natural to leave the lights off , light a few candles , and gather near the hearth . Gradually , people drifted , some to the bow window in the living room , some across the hall to the matching window in the dining room . Kelli pulled a chair over to the small corner window that pointed directly toward Peterson 's house . <p> In Peterson 's yard were all the little Bichons , sitting in the same two half-circles . They were so small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward Peterson 's front porch were so straight and determined . I could picture them on ships , standing in the bow , sailing blithely , even bravely , onto the open sea . Behind them like Roman sentinels were three rows of large black and tan Doberman Pinschers . The dog in the front row in the center was larger than all of them and looked so much like Seaboy that I almost gasped . Clustered by Mrs. O'Shane 's porch and along Peterson 's untrimmed privet hedge lurked the shadow things . <p> Suddenly , unexpectedly , Peterson came outside . Even from this distance , I could see that he had a big stupid grin on his face as if he knew that he had spun the balance wheel a little bit harder , a little bit better than Elizabeth , as if it were all over already but the laughing . <p> The shadows moved forward , propelled by some means I could n't detect . One minute they were by the hedge , the next they were halfway across the yard . The dogs shifted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadows . The Bichons moved closer to the front steps ; they never took their eyes away from Peterson and I thought perhaps he took a step toward the door . I realized that I 'd been holding my breath and released it in a rush . What could those creatures , as creepy as they were , do to a dog that was already dead ? <p> Right then , one of the shadow things touched the front leg of one of the Dobermans . The dog howled , not the lonely howl of a dog in a back yard at night , but a piercing shattering howl , like a scream . I heard Kelli Horoshi gasp . Where the shadow had touched , the skin , the muscle , everything , had flayed completely off the dog , leaving nothing but gleaming white bone behind . The shadow moved forward . The dog never hesitated . It screamed again , ran forward on its three good legs , and leaped into the center of the shadow . The shadow ripped backward into the hedge , shrank to nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Horoshis and Mrs. O'Shane and the Donalds and I talked about it all the next day , but we never could agree on exactly what happened . <p> This is what I saw : <p> The shadow 's disappearance caused things to freeze for several very long seconds . Peterson 's grin seemed to fade . The Bichons looked at the Dobermans , who never stopped looking at the shadows . Except one , the large one that looked like Seaboy suddenly turned and looked intently up the street . I looked too . <p> Elizabeth had jumped off her porch and was running up the street toward Peterson 's . We could see her standing on the sidewalk 's edge shouting at him . He shouted back . He laughed at her , pointing at the shadow things , which had started to regroup near the porch . She pointed to the dogs and shook her head . Peterson laughed again . The shadows began to move toward the dogs again . The Dobermans stood , the hair up on the backs of their necks . Elizabeth stood very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wary . Elizabeth called the dogs to her . She held their heads , petted each of them and kissed them on the muzzle . Then she stepped in front of them and started toward the shadow things . Peterson started shouting at her , screaming it seemed to me with his hands gripping the rickety porch railing . He certainly was n't laughing any longer . <p> Elizabeth continued across the lawn . When she was almost to the shadow things , she was joined by the large Doberman , the one that looked like Seaboy . He pushed his head underneath her hand . She stopped and looked down at him . She looked back at the other dogs , looked down at him again . She left her hand on his head and together they walked into the shadow things . <p> This time there was n't any screaming . They walked in . They disappeared . And it was over . The shadow things were gone . The other dogs walked over to the place they 'd been and sniffed the ground . Then , completely ignoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the streetlights . <p> Kelli Horoshi came to my house early the next morning and said , " You 'd better come see . " I went outside with her to find Peterson carrying boxes out of his house and packing them into his car . Every once in a while he 'd look back over his shoulder as if he was afraid something was after him . " Do you think he 's really going ? " Kelli whispered . <p> I said , " I think it will come whether he runs away or not . " <p> " What ? " <p> " A final tally . " <p> She looked at me funny , then she felt . <p> Later , I went and stood on the sidewalk in front of Peterson 's house and looked at the spot where Elizabeth had walked into the shadow . She 'd never hesitated . I do n't think it mattered what happened , this time she was there . I stopped at her house . The lights were on in the hallway and the kitchen . I turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elizabeth did n't have any relatives ; the mortgage was paid . Already it had the look of a house that no one lived in , a presence that would sit with us for a long time to come . I looked for the tally stone , but I could n't find it anywhere . <p> Tuesday , I 'm going down to the shelter and see if they have any of those fully little white dogs with the round faces .
