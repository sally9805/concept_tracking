An overview of the health care industry 's trend toward multihealth systems is presented and specific adaptive strategies for social work managers in health care are suggested . The challenges to social work leaders during this transition from largely free-standing , privately owned health care institutions to corporately owned , horizontally and vertically integrated delivery systems are discussed in terms of identity , style , and substance . Directors of social work departments in multihealth corporations will need to resolve issues of institutional versus corporate identity as well as those of corporate versus professional identity . A multioptional management style that incorporates networking and political expertise should be cultivated . Substantive demands in the areas of management information systems , productivity , quality assurance , and budgeting also must be addressed . The emergence of multihealth systems poses major challenges and unique opportunities to the social work profession . Awareness of managerial strategies and critical content areas can help social work leaders enhance the role and contribution of social work in these exciting and complex health care delivery systems . <p> In an era of increasingly rigorous health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are being forced to examine new organizational structures and financial arrangements to assure survival of their hospitals . In this time of health care industry transition , experts predict the " demise of full service hospitals " ( Johnson &; Johnson , 1982 , pp. 4-5 ) and the continued creation of comprehensive multihealth corporations , or multis . <p> The formation of a multihospital system , defined as two or more hospitals with a common form of ownership , typically is the first move toward becoming a comprehensive multihealth corporation . An examination of the trend toward multihospital systems confirms that the industry is moving toward multis . In 1975 , multihospital systems represented 24 percent of all community hospitals ( American Hospital Association AHA , 1975 ) . By 1987 , however , nearly 46 percent of community hospitals were system affiliates representing a 22 percent increase ( AHA Guide to the Health Care Field , 1988 ) . The total number of multihospital systems declined between 1980 and 1985 ( Table 1 ) . However , the total number of hospitals in multihospital systems increased , indicating that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some healthcare analysts predict that the industry eventually will be dominated by 25 to 50 of these very large corporations ( Tibbitts , 1984 ) . " MULTIS " DEFINED <p> A multihealth corporation is a health care organization that transcends the boundaries of the traditional hospital . Its organization is characterized by both horizontal and vertical integration . Horizontal integration refers to the combining of similar organizations , in this case hospitals , into a larger unit with the primary objective of enhancing market power ( Kaluzny &; Hernandez , 1988 , p. 401 ) . Vertical integration describes the acquisition of other business entities that have an influence on the organization 's flow of goods , services , or products or , stated in system terms , on its input-output exchange ( Kaluzny &; Hernandez , 1988 , p. 400 ) . An example of a health care system that is integrated horizontally and vertically would be a corporation that includes a number of acute care hospitals of varying sizes and with various specialties ( horizontal ) , as well as urgent care centers , a home health care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rehabilitation facility ( vertical ) . <p> Basically , a multi strives to include service delivery organizations at each level of care from preventive to long term with sufficient market dominance at each level to secure financial viability . By attempting to provide the entire continuum of health care services , the multi can assure a more efficient and predictable flow of patients because it has feeder units that channel patients into the corporation 's acute care subsystems and receptor units that accept patients needing further care after hospital discharge . <p> Increasingly , multi organizations are being diversified and restructured , so that the health-related units are part of a multicorporate system controlled by a central corporation or holding company that is not itself a health delivery enterprise . The holding company then can invest in businesses that are more lucrative than its health care units , such as real estate , parking facilities , and so forth ( Figure 1 ) . With sufficient attention to federal antitrust laws and to legal provisions governing not-for-profit or 501(c) ( 3 ) organizations , this institutional consolidation and participation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax-exempt status of the multi . <p> Ideally , multis offer the potential to Enhance internal hospital efficiency by achieving economies of scale ; Reduce costs by eliminating excess capacities via service consolidation ; Improve managerial capability ; Enhance service provision by improving access , availability , and quality ; Promote institutional status and prestige through increased size and complexity ; Maximize political leverage and clout through combined strength and size . ( Bisbee , 1981 , p. 79 ) CHALLENGE TO SOCIAL WORK MANAGEMENT <p> Compared to the administration of a social work department in an independent or freestanding hospital , social work management within a multihealth corporation requires both subtle and substantive changes . Although the primary administrative responsibilities still exist ( Lurie &; Rosenberg , 1984 ) , the emphasis given to specific functions , the unit of attention addressed , and the approach to implementation entail some shifts in thought and practice for the social work manager . Unique challenges to social work management in a multihealth corporation fall into three broad categories that reflect the type of change each challenge requires : identity , style , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrator in a subsidiary hospital of a multihealth corporation must balance three separate and occasionally conflicting identities : corporate , institutional , and professional . Although social workers are accustomed to sorting out the differences between their institutional and professional allegiances and value systems , employment in a multi poses certain dilemmas for social work managers that require careful analysis , prudent judgment , and calculated action . <p> Institutional Versus Corporate Identity . It is vital that social work administrators understand the process of developing an identity with an organization in this age of " consolidation fever " ( Schramm , 1981 , p. 127 ) . Mintzberg ( 1983 ) specified pathways through which individual identity with , or loyalty to , an organization develops . Dominant pathways include the natural attraction of individuals with compatible personal goals ; recruitment and screening procedures for new employees ; formal attempts by the organization to indoctrinate or socialize ; and the methodical cultivation of loyalty by individuals motivated to succeed within the organization . Furthermore , an employee may identify with the organizational leadership , with the corporate mission and goals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> Whichever pathway is chosen , identification with or loyalty to one 's primary institution ( such as the corporately owned subsidiary hospital ) does not guarantee harmonious bonding with the parent corporation . In fact , where there are strong ties with an individual institution , there may be more difficulty establishing corporate bonding following an organizational merger . Successful immersion into the corporate organizational culture requires that one relinquish , at least to some degree , an attachment to and identity with the subsidiary unit . The social work manager can take pride in the department and maintain a sense of loyalty to the subsidiary institution only if this identification serves the corporate structure , mission , and goals . Parochialism breeds conflict and unhealthy competition . <p> Although the corporation may be fiercely competitive with industry rivals , corporate culture calls for department heads of both horizontally and vertically related subsidiaries to become " team players " and engage in collaborative endeavors within the parent corporation . However , the multi organizational structure also has the potential to increase competition . Department managers who before faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as social work versus nursing or pastoral care ) , now may experience intraprofessional competition with their peers in other subsidiary units . Although this competition can be productive and lead to greater efficiency and effectiveness for all parties , the organizational structure of multis instead may intensify this intradisciplinary conflict . To make professional rivalry a positive and productive factor , the department administrator must identify with the larger corporate ( rather than only the institutional ) mission . <p> Corporate Versus Professional Identity . Conflict between corporate and professional identity is particularly likely in a not-for-profit subsidiary hospital within a multihealth corporation with sizable for-profit ventures . A social work director in a not-for-profit hospital might reluctantly accept cutbacks in patient care funds , hiring freezes , or mounting pressures to reduce inpatient length of stay , viewing these as necessary evils imposed by stringent government health care policies , cost-conscious private third-party payors , or decreasing hospital profit margins . <p> However , the values to which professional social workers subscribe and the altruistic motives that led most of them to pursue this particular career can be challenged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be prospering . Such a dynamic is especially likely to occur when those ventures affect patients , through hefty parking bills from the for-profit parking garage or full-price rates for durable medical equipment from the corporately owned subsidiary . <p> This perceived double standard can lead social workers to cynicism , disdain , and blatant anger . It is the director 's responsibility not only to understand and allow staff expression of their reactions , but also , in time , to help them become more aware of and sensitive to the larger corporate concerns that are involved . On the other hand , the social work director has the responsibility to provide leadership to corporate management from the unique perspective and value base of the social work profession . As a patient advocate at the corporate level , the social work manager can influence the direction and destiny of the organization substantially by contributing social work expertise and information on psychosocial aspects of patient care , gaps in services , unmet needs , access issues , and so on ( Rosenberg &; Clarke , 1987 ) . As Rosenberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the direct linkage between the direct line practitioners and the planners and policy makers " ( p. 1 ) . There are few areas where the manager 's ability to foster open discussion , supply a critical managerial perspective and fulfill the responsibilities of this linkage function will be tested as strenuously as in discerning the degree of congruence or conflict between social work and corporate values in emerging multi systems . Management Style in Multis <p> According to Webster 's New World Dictionary ( 2nd ea. ) the label style denotes a " distinction , excellence , originality and character " that distinguishes an individual . Three management styles are of value to the social work director in a multihealth system : ( 1 ) multiple option , ( 2 ) network , and ( 3 ) political . <p> Multiple Option Management . Naisbitt and Elkins ( 1983 ) pointed out that the days of choosing between either the doctor 's office or the hospital are long gone . There now are multiple options for care  --  either the doctor 's office or the urgent care center or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-help network or many other options . <p> Likewise , social work managers in emerging health care systems will need to broaden their concept of " hospital social work " ( with the categories of either inpatient or outpatient services ) to one of " social work in health care " where social work services are provided in a range of settings and where a diversity of skills is required . As corporations seek to capture larger market shares by expanding both the horizontal and vertical array of health care services , social work managers will need to promote and integrate the value of social work 's contribution at each stage and phase of the health/illness continuum . An understanding , integration , and communication of preventive , primary , acute , post-acute , rehabilitative , and long-term care , is essential in solidifying the role of social work within a multisystem structure . ( Because one individual rarely can manage the delivery of social work services at each level of care and across all subsidiaries , identification with the broader corporate versus restricted institutional objectives is important . ) The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to social workers but , until the emergence of horizontally and vertically integrated health care systems , few have had the opportunity and challenge of conceptualizing their practice and assuming program planning responsibilities in this multiple option context . <p> Network Model Management . Relationships between individuals and their social groups have been termed networks ( Mitchell &; Trickett , 1980 ) . The shift from hierarchical to network management is another major social transformation observed by Naisbitt ( 1984 ) that is particularly applicable to the health care industry . The network style of management is characterized by open communication ( laterally and diagonally ) , informality , cross-discipline structures , egalitarianism , and bottom-up decision making . Network management is based on the realization that the traditional hierarchy or pyramidal structure no longer applies to industries where service or production hinges on rapid transfer of information , high technology , an educated and specialized workforce , complex tasks requiring cross-discipline coordination , and independent professional judgment . According to Shortell and Kaluzny ( 1988 ) , these characteristics define today 's health care organizations and make health care management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is considered " the great equalizer " ( Naisbitt , 1984 , p. 220 ) . In network management style , persons at any level within all subsidiaries are peers , because information is important , not someone 's profession , educational degree , or status . The norms of the new corporate culture emphasize informality and egalitarianism . <p> Political Management . " Politics " is a dirty word to many social workers . Brieland ( 1982 ) noted that social workers are reluctant to involve themselves in activities that they see as political in nature , even though their clients , the services they seek to provide , and the choice of interventions available to them all are directly influenced by political decisions . However , if social work services are to remain an integral aspect of health care delivery , social work administrators will need to develop expertise and skill in operating within the political arena of multihealth systems . <p> Politics has been variously defined as the " art of balancing , " " the art of compromise , " and the " art of the possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1978 ) defined polities as " the use of authority and power to affect values , norms and goals of a social system " ( p. 34 ) . According to Tombari ( 1984 ) , management is the skillful employment of an organization 's resources to achieve predetermined objectives . Thus , political management can be viewed as the effective use of authority and power resources to achieve organizational and societal goals . <p> Morlock , Nathanson , and Alexander ( 1988 ) , defined authority as " legitimate or formally constituted power " ( p. 266 ) . It is based on the recognition of an individual 's or group 's moral right to exert influence due to their formal position in the hierarchical control structure . Within classical management theory , participants in the authority system fulfill either " superior " or " subordinate " positions based on the assumption of a " scalar chain of command " ( Weber , 1947 ) . In attempting to influence others ' behaviors and attitudes , persons in authority can resort to both personal ( direct supervisory ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Authority thus constitutes one type of " power "  --  formal or hierarchically sanctioned . Because large organizations ( such as multihealth systems ) always will require some degree of control and accountability , an appreciation of the formal authority system and its power is important . However , the task requirements and work force characteristics of health care organizations are such that the traditional pyramid structure of authority may be least effective as a management principle . This realization has prompted many leading health care organizations to adopt a matrix organizational structure with more than one line of authority and a balance of power between functional and project managers ( Davis &; Lawrence , 1977 ) . Based on these organizational variables and the fact that social work in hospitals remains an ancillary service with relatively little formal power , social work administrators need to understand and exercise power that stems from sources other than authority . <p> Morlock et al . ( 1988 ) cited three types or sources of power  --  ( 1 ) resource , ( 2 ) expert , and ( 3 ) referent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derived from authority . Resource power accompanies having control over a critical resource that is essential to the functioning of the organization ; in short supply or concentrated to a few people ; and nonsubstitutable ( Mintzberg , 1983 ) . Expert power is derived from possession of special knowledge or skills important to the functioning of the organization . Finally , referent power ( or charismatic power ) , which has been shown to be more effective than formal power as a basis for affecting work group behavior ( Student , 1968 ) , is based on the ability to inspire others to imitate one 's behavior or emulate one 's attitude , values , and beliefs . <p> As a manager , the social work administrator has access to each of these potential sources of power . As a department head , the social work director exercises both personal and bureaucratic controls in setting and enforcing standards of practice , work hours , report requirements , and so on . In drawing on resource power , consumer and regulatory policies , as well as professional standards can be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institution comply with these standards and attain approval by licensing bodies . Other typical resources that social work influences , such as public relations ( via consumer satisfaction ) , employee morale ( via staff support activities ) , and community sentiment ( by addressing or serving on agency boards ) all can increase the department 's power if top management is aware of and appreciates the unique role of social work in promoting these key resources . Domains in which the social work director should be able to claim expert power for staff include , but are not limited to , the abilities to reduce length of stay , to ensure the psychosocial appropriateness of discharge , to provide medical crisis counseling , to link persons with appropriate financial and social services , to facilitate multidisciplinary decision making , to enhance physician-patient communication , and to increase patient compliance with medical treatment . Even referent or charismatic power , though often seen as an innate ability , basically consists of qualities that can be developed ( such as honesty , trustworthiness , commitment , and integrity ) or skills that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to problem solving , and leadership ) . <p> A study of hospital social work departments by Jansson and Simmons ( 1984 ) found that the more social work directors were aware of these different power bases and consciously engaged in the process of political or strategic management , the more able they were to influence hospital administration and acquire greater resources and service roles for the department . Other research ( Kotter , 1979 ) also has demonstrated that successful health care managers distinguish the bases of power , are sensitive to its source , and are careful to keep their actions consistent with others ' expectations . The rapid increase in the number , size , and organizational complexity of multihealth systems poses serious questions about how policy decisions are made and how resources are allocated . Management effectiveness within these complex organizational networks will require a " sophisticated understanding of power relationships and influence systems . . . as well as a better awareness among managers of how authority and other types of power can be used constructively " ( Morlock et al. , 1988 , p. 267 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to integrate departmental goals with corporate expectations , and who do not develop skills in effectively utilizing bases of authority and power , face the almost certain outcome of watching their department 's roles , resources , and programs stagnate or diminish . Demonstrating Corporate Worth <p> A number of substantive challenges face the social work manager in a multihealth system . Although most of the program components discussed here apply to social work administrators in freestanding health care organizations , these components become even more important in a " bottom line " business milieu of multis , where each department must not only compete for resources and demonstrate its corporate worth in relation to other disciplines and departments within the subsidiary , but also in comparison to other social work departments within the corporation . To be successful in this competition , the social work manager will need to develop the following four interrelated systems : ( 1 ) information , ( 2 ) productivity , ( 3 ) quality assurance , and ( 4 ) budgeting . <p> Management Information System . A management information system ( MIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systematic procedures of gathering and processing information ( Weissman , 1984 ) . In this time of strict monetary policies and fiscal restraint , human services professionals increasingly will be required to make difficult decisions regarding the allocation of scarce resources , and will be asked to justify these decisions both by staff within and by administrators outside the department . MIS can be viewed as a system of accounting , because its function is to " accumulate and communicate information essential to the understanding of the activities of an enterprise " ( American Accounting Association , 1957 ) 1 . There are certain qualitative characteristics that this information should possess . To assure that the efforts to collect and process information are worth the costs , data should be understandable , relevant , reliable , timely , useful , comparable , and verifiable ( Shugart , Benjamin , Francia , &; Strawser , 1988 ) . <p> Productivity System . Productivity typically is defined as the ratio of outputs to inputs ( Scott &; Shortell , 1988 ) . The social work manager is faced with the challenge of selecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures to answer the question : " Who is doing what , to whom , and how much is it costing us ? " Like other information in the departmental data management system , productivity measures can be used for both internal ( such as managerial accounting ) and external ( such as financial accounting ) purposes ( Shugart et al. , 1988 ) . In addition , the information should possess the general qualities of other MIS data elements described above  --  particularly those of being reliable , relevant , comparable , and timely . An example of a productivity information system for external reporting purposes that uses a ratio of social work encounters/visits ( outputs ) to full-time equivalent hours worked ( inputs ) to establish a productivity percentage is presented ( Table 2 ) . For managerial and supervisory purposes , this report can be broken down by individual social worker or by medical specialty . <p> Quality Assurance System . With the enactment of the Medicare prospective payment system , quality assurance programs have become a key factor in hospitals obtaining accreditation from the Joint Commission on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incentives for early discharge have made physician review organizations , empowered by Congress to perform utilization review and quality control of medical practice , focus their attention on the quality aspect . As Berkman ( 1988 ) noted , quality assurance now has taken precedence over access and cost containment concerns . The revised JCAHO standards require that social work , like other hospital departments , monitor in an ongoing , routine fashion both quantitative and qualitative indicators of service provided . Routine audits of the medical record can provide information regarding timing of social work intervention , frequency of documentation , adequacy of documentation , appropriateness of social work plan , achievement of outcomes and whether follow-up contact was made to assure continuity of care . Surveys of patients , both while they are inpatients and postdischarge , provide useful data on satisfaction with services , perception of the social work role , and recommendations to improve service delivery . <p> Budgeting System . As Holsteen stated , " A budges expresses a plan of action " ( 1983 , p. 32 ) . The budget constitutes the blueprint of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during a designated period . Stretch ( 1984 ) outlined seven managerial objectives of budgeting : ( 1 ) controlling , ( 2 ) allocating , ( 3 ) monitoring , ( 4 ) prioritizing , ( 5 ) evaluating , ( 6 ) planning , and ( 7 ) programming . In the budgeting process the commitment to specific programs , populations , and ideals is operationalized . <p> The managerial objectives presented above are met by translating the department mission , goals , and objectives into monetary terms . A number of budgeting methods are available to the social work manager . Most well-known methods include zero-based budgeting , program budgeting , line-item budgeting , functional budgeting , and special or adjustment budgeting ( Holsteen , 1983 ; Stretch , 1984 ) . Whatever approach to budgeting is employed , it is important to keep in mind that these are methodological tools that can be used to help flesh out and actualize values , commitments , and beliefs . Methods are selected based on how well they serve these objectives ( Reid , 1974 ) . <p> The emergence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profession but also unique opportunities . The managerial strategies and content areas discussed in this article can assist social work leaders in enhancing the role and contribution of social work in these exciting and complex health care delivery systems . <p> 1 Having set enhancement of professional accountability as a major goal , the Society of Hospital Social Work Directors is currently in the process of formulating a minimum data set for hospital social work in the hopes that this will provide a national data base and allow comparability of practice ( Coulton , Friedman , &; Keller , 1988 ) .
