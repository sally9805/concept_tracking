Republican optimists murmured two autumns ago that Dan Quayle 's presence on the G.O.P. ticket might attract votes from women beguiled by his good looks . Wrong . The presumed sex bomb proved to be a dud on Election Day , according to NBC 's exit poll . Now women give Quayle even less support than men do . A recent TIME survey found that only 20% of American women ( vs. 30% of men ) view Quayle as qualified to assume power if something happened to George Bush . The contrast is one of many demonstrating that a gender gap still yawns in U.S. politics . <P> Some analysts thought that the gap between male and female opinion would moderate with the passing of the macho Ronald Reagan . Not so , says political scientist Ethel Klein of Columbia University : " Women and men are now taking a different lens to politics . " What many women see through their glass is a less hospitable vista than men perceive . Polls show , for instance , that women are consistently more bearish on the economy than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more . Perhaps because they earn less than men and have less job security , they feel more vulnerable to hard times . Women are also more inclined to believe government action is needed to ward off economic threats and social problems . This makes them somewhat more likely than men to vote Democratic . In fact , one reason that the Reagan-Bush victories of the ' 80s failed to translate into a full party realignment is that in critical Senate contests female voters elected liberals . <P> Women are less keen about adventures overseas . When Bush moved troops to the Middle East this summer , 80% of American men surveyed favored a military attack on Iraq if it invaded Saudi Arabia ; only 55% of women agreed . Nonetheless , Bush 's standing among women improved in early fall . In a recent NBC poll , female approval of the President 's job performance was just six points below the percentage for men . <P> ) Do women voters favor female candidates ? The evidence on that score is spotty . Issues seem to prevail over chromosomes when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no debate on one statistic : women are voting in proportion to their actual numbers , and there are several million more of them than there are men . Thus candidates are under pressure to spy the difference between the lenses that men and women train on politics .
