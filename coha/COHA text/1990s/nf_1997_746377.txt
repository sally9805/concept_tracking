Physical fitness and the standards of physical fitness of children continue to be a topic of significant debate . Specifically , there are varying opinions as to whether American children are physically fit ( Corbin &; Pangrazi , 1992 ) . The degree of fitness may be related to : ( a ) the definition of fitness that is assumed , ( b ) the testing protocol utilized , or ( c ) the standards against which an individual 's scores are compared . Currently , the standards used to assess fitness classify 1935% and 21-50% of the boys and girls respectively , as unfit ( Blair , 1992 ) . <p> Physical fitness standards may have an impact on a child 's behavior and ultimately the level of fitness that a child achieves . If the standards or expectations are too high , this may increase a child 's frustration and discourage participation in activities that promote fitness . Conversely , if the standards are too low , physical fitness and perhaps activity are devalued and a child 's interest in physical activity is lessened . Moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand the importance of physical fitness testing , when in fact it may be the case that the tests are not relevant to children ( Hopple , 1992 ) . While it is true that some children may understand that being a " couch potato " is not advised , they may not see the connection between a sedentary childhood and adult health and disease ( Hopple , 1992 ) . <p> Few studies have examined the impact of the physical education environment on physical fitness and physical fitness test scores . The physical education teacher is faced with a barrage of factors that affect life in the gymnasium . Locke ( 1975 ) shared four complexities that teachers have little , if any , control over : ( a ) number of students in each class , ( b ) diversity of students ' cognitive and physical skills , ( c ) nature of the subject matter , and ( d ) constraint of time . The physical educator must cope with these aspects of teaching on a daily basis . Not only does this affect the teacher , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protocols . Hence , the results of fitness tests can be greatly affected by the context of the class . <p> The teacher 's approach towards physical fitness and fitness testing may greatly influence a child 's attitudes toward physical fitness and physical activity . NASPE defines a successful program and teacher as one that develops physically educated individuals . Franck et al . characterize a physically educated person as one who ( a ) has learned a variety of skills , ( b ) is physically fit , ( c ) participates regularly in physical activity , ( d ) understands the benefits of physical activity and ( e ) values physical activity as a part of their lifestyle . If a physical education teacher conveys to his/her students that a strong relationship exists between fitness test scores and activity and the child fails to meet the test expectations this may reflect a sincere dislike of activity and fitness testing by the child . Additionally , if the child and teacher expect good fitness test scores based on high levels of activity and the results do not match expectations the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitness testing ( Pangrazi &; Corbin , 1993 ) . Moreover , if a child has a negative attitude towards physical fitness and fitness testing this may influence his/her level of physical activity . <p> Investigators have begun to examine children 's thoughts and attitudes towards physical education ( Graham , et al. , 1992 ; Ratliffe , Imwold , &; Conkell , 1992 ) . When students listed activities they participated in during a physical education class that they considered " not fun , " all but two of the activities directly related to physical fitness . <p> If the goal of physical education programs is to develop physically educated students then a greater understanding of all the variables related to fitness and physical activity must be identified . Lacking in the literature is a comprehensive qualitative and quantitative examination of the relationship between physical fitness test scores , and children 's perceptions of fitness and fitness testing . In addition , there is a paucity of research that has explored the impact of environment on a child 's test scores and attitudes towards testing . Therefore , the purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a curriculum that emphasizes fitness on students ' self-perceived level of fitness , and their perceptions of physical fitness as a curricular component of their physical education experience . The following questions guided this study : ( a ) What are the teaching techniques that highlight fitness and fitness testing in a physical education class , and what is the classroom environment , ( b ) What is the relationship between a student 's self-perceived physical fitness attitude test score and actual fitness scores , and ( c ) What are students ' beliefs and perceptions about physical fitness ? Methods Participants <p> A rural elementary school in Virginia was selected as the test site . An intact fourth grade physical education class of 51 students was observed by both investigators once a week for four months . Seventeen students ( selected participants , SP ) from the physical education class were selected to complete a questionnaire to assess their self-perceived physical fitness attitudes . This left 34 non-selected participants ( NSP ) from the original pool of 51 students . The 17 participants were selected through purposive sampling ( Lincoln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ( a ) gender , ( b ) skill level , ( c ) perceived body composition , and ( d ) self-esteem . The perspective of the participants was determined by employing the use of participant observation and interviews ( Lincoln &; Guba , 1985 ) . <p> A consent form which provided information about the project and the investigators ' backgrounds was completed by each parent/ guardian . Every possible means was used to protect the anonymity of the participants and their school , by using pseudonyms in intermediate products from data production , analysis and interpretation , and in all written and oral reports from the study . All methods and procedures for the study were approved by the Institutional Review Board for Research Involving Human Subjects , teacher , principal , and school board serving the elementary school . Procedure <p> Participant observations were conducted during the physical education class on Fridays which were designated by the physical education teacher as " Fabulous Fitness Fridays . " As participant observers we assisted the teacher with the class during the planned fitness lessons . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jump ropes , took part in a game or took field notes during the class . The investigators also participated in administrating the fitness testing in early May . At the conclusion of each visit , field notes were prepared . The field notes consisted of descriptions of events that occurred during the class and student interactions . In an effort to address credibility , the inquirers implemented triangulation of data and utilized peer debriefing ( Lincoln &; Guba , 1985 ) following each observation in an attempt to probe interpretations and to deal with feelings and emotions that might bias further observations . The visitations gave the investigators an opportunity to interact with each student . After a number of observations , the investigators decided that an interview should be conducted with the physical educator to verify our own speculations and observations . Both investigators interviewed Ms. Babcock for approximately 45 minutes about her philosophy and the physical education program . The interview was audio taped and transcribed verbatim . <p> Observations of the fitness testing environment and procedures were recorded . The entire class completed the battery of fitness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fitness which included , curl-ups , push-ups , mile run and the sit-and-reach . Fitness scores were collected for the entire class . During the week of fitness testing the participants also completed the Children 's Physical Fitness Attitude Inventory ( CPFAI ; Barber , 1991 ) . The inventory was used to assess general attitudes about physical fitness and was developed to assess children 's attitudes towards health-related fitness . The inventory determines whether or not a child has a positive attitude towards fitness ( NASPE , 1991 ) . Validity and reliability have been established . The inventory is designed to assess a child 's interest , attitudes , perceptions , and values about physical fitness and physical fitness activities in three sections : attraction , estimation , and value . Each item in the inventory is scored on a 4 point Likert scale . Scores are computed for each section and a total score is derived from the sum of the individual section scores . The range of scores possible for each section are : attraction 14-56 , estimation 15-60 , value scale 18-72 , and total 47188 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitness testing 17 SP were interviewed directly following their physical education class . By this time , the students knew the investigators and were aware of our interest in their thoughts related to physical education . To begin the interviews , each student was informed that their comments would be kept confidential . The interviews were structured to insure consistency between the inquirers . The interview inventory included such questions as : What do you enjoy most in physical education , what do you dislike about your physical education class , what made you feel good while taking the fitness test and was there anything you disliked about the fitness testing ? The interviews also allowed for students to elaborate and follow-up questions to be addressed that were not part of the inventory . Each interview took approximately 20 minutes and was audio taped . Data Analysis <p> The analysis of the qualitative data was an ongoing process to insure that new insights were taken into consideration as the investigation continued . From each interview question the responses were read and organized into categories that emerged from the student 's perceptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) was employed by the inquirers in reviewing the data . Emphasis was placed on the children 's thoughts and perceptions about fitness in physical education and fitness testing . An independent t-test was used to determine whether there were gender differences for each of the physical fitness tests . Correlation analysis was used to examine the relationship between the SP fitness scores and their total physical fitness attitude score . Statistical data were obtained using the SAS program ( Cary , NC ) and Microsoft Excel ( Micosoft , Redmond , WA ) . Statistical significance was accepted at p &lt; 0.05 . Results <p> From the observations , the inquirers were able to develop an awareness of the ecology of the gymnasium . The following is a description of life in the gymnasium during physical education class and fitness testing . In addition , Ms. Babcock shares her beliefs about the program . Describing life in the gymnasium for these participants is an essential component of understanding the context for the development of physically educated people . The setting may subsequently impact physical activity , attitudes and fitness scores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a peek at the context in which these fourth graders participate in physical education . The qualitative data were utilized to describe the physical education environment and teaching techniques implemented by the teacher . Additionally , students ' perceptions and beliefs as they pertain to fitness in physical education are highlighted by their own voices . Classroom Environment and Teaching Techniques <p> The gym was relatively small , with high ceilings and a dividing door which closed off the gymnasium from the lunchroom . On the opposite side was a stage which Ms. Babcock used to give more space for her classes . The gymnasium walls displayed different posters of male professional athletes , rules , fitness and health reminders , fitness stations , and encouraging anecdotes . The physical education class met five days a week for 40 minutes . Ms. Babcock also had a teacher 's aide to help with the class of 51 fourth graders . The students from two different classes and in their street clothes , entered the gymnasium in an orderly fashion and sat at their assigned spot  --  there was little gym floor space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick reminder from Ms. Babcock to the students to settle down and the students listened attentively for the day 's activities . Fitness was an underlying component of the physical education curriculum . Ms. Babcock shared her goals for the fourth grade program : <p> We use a movement philosophy so that each child has their own equipment so they can get as much practice as they can . We have an underlying focus of fitness which we try to do throughout the year . We set up different kinds of running programs . When we are inside , we try to do aerobics and a lot of jumping rope . We jump for four , six or eight minutes , so that when we go back outside we do n't have to start over at ground zero for the mile run . Our games are fitness-oriented and we focus on fitness in every way that we can . <p> In addition , one day a week was designated as Fabulous Fitness Friday . Typically , during this class , the students moved from one station to the next as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and flexibility . On one particular day once the students settled down , Ms. Babcock began the class by reviewing an aerobic dance routine  --  the different steps were listed on a blackboard and Ms. Babcock utilized the stage to demonstrate while the students followed along . They reviewed each step once and then the music was added . The majority of students followed along quite well although there were a couple overweight students who fell behind and one student acted silly . After the aerobics routine , Ms. Babcock quickly explained the six fitness stations : ( a ) hose pulls , ( b ) push-ups , ( c ) pull-ups , ( d ) ball squeeze , ( e ) sit-ups , and lastly ( f ) rope jumping which was done in between each of the other stations . The students were organized in stations by squad numbers and began the activity immediately . Everyone was active except for those standing in line for the pull-up station or when resting between stations . A few students made comments about not liking Fitness Fridays and this was reflected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ms. Babcock attended to the pull-up bar to assist students with their form . The teacher 's aide was helping children with their rope jumping . During the last 10 minutes of class , perimeter dodge ball was played . By then many children had lost steam and motivation to continue with the stations . Alexandra described fitness day in her own words : Well fitness days are the days we go around to each station ... we do a station and then go back and jump rope . This might be 50 or 100 times . Then we go to another station and keep going back and forth . But when we are outside on fitness day , we just keep going ... sometimes we run a whole lap or run a little lap around the black top . On fitness days we do sit-ups and running laps between each thing . <p> Elizabeth explained fitness day for her as : We go to different stations , we do pull-ups , you have one try to get it . Then jump rope in between every station and do a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do our two favorite ones and then we sit on the steps to get ready to play a game . <p> Mark commented about the number of students in his class making it difficult to safely participate : <p> I do n't like all the running around when it is really crowded , sometimes we run into people and hit each other with . jump ropes . <p> The physical fitness tests took approximately four weeks out of the school year for Ms. Babcock to administer . The tests were given once in the fall and then again in the spring . Since her classes met five days a week this meant that a minimum of 20 days out of the year were spent administering fitness tests and conducting make-ups . Ms. Babcock expressed concern about the amount of time spent with taking a test and spoke of the impact this had on her curriculum and student skill development . Self-Perceived Fitness and Fitness Scores <p> The students ' responses were neutral in relation to fitness testing . Most believed that they took fitness tests to see how hard they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A couple students commented on trying to see their improvements from one test to the next . Students overwhelmingly felt the most positive when their test scores improved . Joe pointed out in his interview : <p> I like to try to improve my score on my fitness test and the mile . I try to get the best score I can and try as hard as 1 can . I did n't feel good about the fitness test because I did n't make the excellent category . I dropped off the pull-up bar because of the sweat on my hands . I had to do six and I got five . Also , I 've grown about this much since last year . <p> Fitness test scores and questionnaire data were analyzed using descriptive statistics , independent t-test , and correlation analysis . Mean physical fitness scores are presented in Tables 1-3 . Gender and group ( SP vs NSP ) differences in fitness scores and physical fitness attitude were determined using an independent t-test . There were no differences in mean fitness scores between the selected participants ( SP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were no significant differences in fitness test scores between the girls and boys with the exception of the sit-and-reach score ( p = 0.042 ) which was higher for girls in the SP group . Due to the lack of gender differences the fitness scores for girls and boys were combined for the correlation analysis . The shuttle run test scores are included as information only , as the shuttle run test is not a part of the President 's Council Physical Fitness Test battery . The correlation coefficients for fitness test scores are presented in Table 4 . There were significant correlations between the pull-up and curl-up ( r=0.60 ) , the pull-up and mile run ( r= - 0.81 ) and , the curl-up and mile run ( r= - 0.55 ) . <p> Results of the CPFAI are presented in Table 5 . To determine the relationship among the fitness scores and total physical fitness attitude score , a correlation was performed , coefficients are presented in Table 6 . All of the physical fitness test scores with the exception of the sit and reach test were related to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shuttle run ( r= - 0.49 ) mile run ( r= - 0.68 ) and , positively related to the pull-up ( r = 0.53 ) and curl-up ( r = 0.58 ) . Student perceptions of physical fitness in physical education class <p> When the students were asked what they enjoyed most in physical education , the majority responded with applying skills . Max summed it up by saying : <p> I like the games and stuff at the end of class . British bull dog and no man 's land , because it has to do with running and while we are playing them we get exercise and stuff . <p> Participating in an activity that has meaning for the children served as a motivational technique . Donnie stated : <p> If we act good during the physical activities , like doing pull-ups , we can play a game at the end . <p> Additionally , the games needed to be something that the children were successful in , as Elaine expressed : <p> I like playing basketball because I 'm good at it and it 's fun . Clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the students . <p> Aspects of physical education that the children did not appreciate were few . Many students stated that they liked everything about physical education . Although running and stretching were the two most frequently identified non-motivators . Students commented with " it makes me tired , hurts my muscles , is boring , and wastes time . " In addition , the students ' perceptions about fitness evolved around the activities they perceived that contributed toward improved fitness levels . Unfortunately , they specifically thought only of the activities from Fabulous Fitness Fridays as the activities that contributed to their fitness levels . The other four days of the week in physical education class , they believed did not contribute to their fitness level . Hence , the activities that they identified as fun and enjoyable had no bearing , in their minds , on fitness while the activities that they hurried through in order to have time to play a game were the only ones that matter in their fitness development . Discussion <p> In the state of Virginia , fitness testing is required of all school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school administrators evaluate physical education programs based on scores submitted . <p> The environment of the physical education class can not be overlooked when discussing the merits of fitness and fitness testing . The curricular emphasis and teaching styles can directly impact the students . For instance , in this case since there were specific days allocated as fitness  --  the students only acknowledged these activities as fitness-oriented . The activities and experiences enjoyed most were not perceived by the students as beneficial to their fitness level . Therefore , programs and activities not only need to enhance fitness but the teachers must be responsible for relating these activities to the fitness components . <p> Large class size and limited facilities obviously limit the amount of practice time during class and additionally creates a strain while conducting the physical fitness tests . Strategies to save time and record scores are implemented possibly at the expense of accuracy and veracity . Hence , programs , students , and teachers may be assessed inappropriately by the use of invalid data . <p> Additionally , these students did not change for physical education  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For instance , on the day of the mile run test some students wore shorts , while others were in long pants , dresses , and inappropriate footwear . All of these factors may influence scores . <p> We believe that physical education is much more than fitness scores and that it is not the physical educator 's place to " make " children fit . It is the teacher 's responsibility to turn children on to movement , teach them fundamental skills that can enhance fitness when involved in activity , and educate children about the importance of movement in their lives . Unfortunately , instead , the children in this fourth grade class were required to spend their educational time taking tests that only measured one component of their physical fitness abilities . <p> Just as physical education is more than just fitness , fitness is more than just physical tests . It may be just as important and more efficient for teachers to use one or two physical tests and also assess the students ' physical fitness attitudes . The results of the present study indicated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President 's Council Physical Fitness Test . The significance or implications of these relationships must be interpreted with caution due to the weakness of any correlation analysis and the low number of participants involved in the present study . However , it is interesting to note some of the significant correlations of the study . The mile run time had a significant correlation to the curl-up and pull-up tests . These findings would suggest that cardiovascular endurance levels of children are related to muscular strength and endurance , as is the case with adults . In the interest of time perhaps only two physical tests are necessary , the mile run and the sit-and-reach test . The time that is saved by reducing the number of physical tests could be used to assess other dimensions of fitness ( e.g. attitude and knowledge ) and provide a much more complete description of a child 's physical fitness . In addition , the time that is saved by reducing the number of physical tests could be spent on enhancing the student 's appreciation for physical activity and less emphasis on " testing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The results of the present study also revealed a significant relationship between a student 's CPFAI score ( physical fitness attitude ) and their scores on physical tests . Specifically , all of the physical fitness test scores ( mile run , pull-up , and curl-up ) with the exception of the sit-and-reach test were related to the physical fitness attitude total score . With the correlation that exists between each of the fitness tests and between the physical fitness attitude scores and the fitness tests , perhaps in the interest of learning and activity it makes sense to administer a pencil and paper test along with a mile run and sit and reach . This could easily be administered in two days , and would give an overall profile of a child 's physical and attitudinal perspective . The findings of the present study support the research of several previous investigations ( Graham , et al . 1992 ; Ratliffe , et al. , 1992 ; Stonecipher , 1995 ) which stress the importance of a child 's attitude towards fitness . Specifically , the physical fitness attitudes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when assessing the physical education curriculum . Prior to the adoption of a revised test battery additional studies should be conducted in view of the weakness that is associated with a correlation analysis using a small sample size . <p> Finally , we must listen . Listen to what Alexandra , Elizabeth , Mark , and Joe are saying . If we want to improve fitness in children begin by improving programs and changing the emphasis and time spent on testing . Develop classes that have meaning and keep the students active and highlight the fitness components that happen to be incorporated into the lesson . In addition , administrators need to be supportive of smaller class size and time which negatively impacts the class quality . Finally , when implementing fitness tests let us not forget Joe 's motivation  --  improvement . Recognize , reward , and encourage efforts that show improvements  --  there is nothing gained by comparing children to others . The students ' voices are missing in curriculum design and evaluation  --  their perspectives can be most valuable and revealing for redesigning and revising programs . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of student 's attitudes and perceptions deserve further exmination . Future studies should be conducted within a variety of settings ( e.g. rural , suburban &; urban ) , across several grade levels and with a large sample size . Expanded studies may help professionals to reach a greater understanding of all the variables that may influence a child 's physical fitness . A good understanding of the variables influencing fitness may help answer some of the questions that remain with regards to children 's patterns of physical activity . <p> This project leaves us with many concerns about the role of fitness and fitness testing in physical education . We are skeptical at the very least of a test that is labor and time intensive and narrow in perspective playing a major role in education . Students ' time and programs may benefit with less emphasis on the physical testing and more on defining ways to promote positive attitudes and skill development to insure that children remain and want to remain active adults . It is time we begin assessing and implementing what is important and valuable for physical education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SD .
