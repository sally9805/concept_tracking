<p> Last Thursday in Memphis , Tenn. , a 2-year-old boy suffering from a neuroblastoma tumor was treated with genetically altered bone marrow cells  --  and little attention was paid to the use of this novel technique that a year ago made medical history . <p> Gene therapy  --  the alteration of a patient 's genetic material to combat disease at its cellular source  --  has become a viable strategy for medical researchers striving to uncover new approaches to incurable diseases . Gene therapy or a variation called gene marking has been performed so far on 22 patients . <p> " People have become more blase about it , " said Malcolm K. Brenner , director of bone marrow transplants at St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital in Memphis . He has now treated four children with bone marrow cells that are genetically marked to trace their activity in the body and will treat three more patients next month . " Like anything new , at first it all looks weird and wonderful and then people realize it 's just another technique , " he said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be inserted into human cells and perform their usual function , said Gerard J. McGarrity , former chairman of the panel that approves gene therapy trials at the National Institutes of Health . " Especially in diseases where there is no effective alternate therapy , this is a reasonable and apparently safe approach . " <p> In 1982 when it was first debated in a congressional hearing , the idea of altering human genes was revolutionary , fraught with ethical implications and unimagined dangers . Religious leaders expressed concern . Ethicists wrote about the potential for changing the nature of man . A president 's commission issued a report called " Splicing Life " that prompted NIH to set up an exhaustive review process for anyone proposing to do gene therapy on people . <p> Then a milestone in medical history was declared in September 1990 , when a 4-year-old girl suffering from an immune system disorder received the world 's first gene therapy . Now , not even a year and a half later , a total of 11 gene therapy trials have been approved by the NIH panel known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven more are under consideration . Members of the panel expect a quadrupling of applications to do gene therapy within the next two years . <p> Opponents of gene-altering technology who feared an unleashing of an Andromeda strain have been reassured by the scientific as well as regulatory restraints on gene experiments . So far , genetic alterations have only been made in specific cells . There have been no mutations in the general genetic blueprint of the patient  --  nor can these genetically-altered cells be passed on to future generations . <p> What began as a highly scrutinized and controversial procedure is on the verge of becoming an almost familiar , if still experimental , therapy . Consequently , the RAC committee , which was formed in 1975 to set standards for recombinant DNA experiments on plants , animals and microorganisms , is moving to streamline the review process in human therapy . Panel members foresee the day when all but the most radical gene therapy would simply be studied by local institutional biosafety committees and not have to be reviewed at the federal level . That is the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Since the RAC was constituted , we have had no untoward reaction in any form of recombinant DNA research , " said McGarrity , now vice president of Genetic Therapy Inc. , a biotechnology company that provides materials to gene therapy trials . " As some of these procedures become more routine , the review can be expedited . " <p> Toward that end , at its meeting in November , the Human Gene Therapy subcommittee of RAC , which had been charged primarily with setting guidelines , voted to dissolve in a year . Researchers applying to do genetic engineering in humans will now go only to the full RAC committee for review . <p> The geographic range of the applications to RAC is another sign that gene therapy is rapidly becoming an accepted experimental strategy . Gene therapy and gene marking began at NIH , but participants or applicants now include : the University of Michigan , which received RAC approval to use gene therapy in the treatment of an inherited high cholesterol disorder ; M.D. Anderson Cancer Center and Baylor College of Medicine , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Memphis ; the University of Rochester Medical Center ; Indiana University Medical School , the University of Washington in Seattle and the UCLA School of Medicine . <p> " Essentially , we 're coast-to-coast , " said Nelson A. Wivel , director of the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities at NIH . " Academic medical centers want to be as multifaceted as they can , to do all the latest modes of treatment . It 's just a matter of keeping pace with developments . " <p> " It 's like the old days of organ transplantation , " he continued . " Twenty-five years ago , only a few places did it . Then it began to spread to the point where we have four hospitals in the larger Washington area alone that do heart transplants . " <p> Gene therapy is taking hold abroad as well . A gene-marking experiment has started in Lyon , France , and other clinical trials have been proposed in Italy and Canada . China and Japan have recently begun to establish review committees for human gene therapy proposals . <p> In some gene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radical departure from previous research but rather an extension of other strategies for changing how cells respond to disease . Immunologists , in particular , have been experimenting for years with bolstering patients ' own disease-fighting cells in the laboratory . <p> In a gene therapy experiment at the NIH last October , for instance , Steven A. Rosenberg reinjected patients with their own tumor cells that had been genetically altered in the laboratory to contain a toxic compound against the tumor . He hoped to provoke a significant immune response with this cancer " vaccine . " <p> Among the assortment of recombinant DNA experiments in humans , gene marking techniques are most likely to be the first given over to local review committees for approval , according to RAC members . In these experiments , the inserted gene performs no therapeutic function but provides a way of tracking the infused cells in the body . <p> For example , Brenner 's 2-year-old patient in Memphis was given his own bone marrow after it had been " purged " of cancerous cells and the cells were marked with the insertion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The inserted gene confers resistance to the neomycin antibiotic . Should the boy go into relapse , researchers can test samples of his tissue to see if the new cells are resistant to neomycin . That will tell them whether the new cancer cells came from the bone marrow or originated elsewhere in his body . <p> But just because the novelty has worn off human gene therapy experiments , they are far from routine . After a review of the RAC committee , each technique must receive approval from the Food and Drug Administration , which regulates new biological agents . <p> Suzanne Epstein , who frequently reviews gene therapy applications to the FDA and helped develop the FDA guidelines , does not see a simplification of the case-by-case review at the federal agency in the near future . She warned biotechnology companies at a genetic engineering conference in Washington last week that even the smallest changes in the character of the viruses carrying new genes into cells would have to be approved by the FDA because of safety questions . <p> Still the applications keep coming . Next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are proposals to use gene therapy to fight ovarian cancer , to mark cells in AIDS patients who have lymphoma and to mark cells in patients with leukemia and melanoma.
