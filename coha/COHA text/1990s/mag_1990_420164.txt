Section : U.S. News ; Cover story Showdown in the gulf The President is hoping that a " new world order " will contain Hussein <p> Dateline : Tokyo ; Saudi Arabia ; Jerusalem ; Amman ; Moscow ; Paris <p> After weeks of comparing Saddam Hussein with Adolf Hitler and suggesting that the Iraqi dictator is a threat to America 's " way of life , " George Bush finally came face-to-face with the cost of eliminating America 's that a full-scale war against Iraq , with its almost certain use of chemical weapons , could cost 20,000 to 30,000 American combat casualties . Officials acknowledge that the estimates may be overly pessimistic ; but when the word was conveyed to Bush , the President grimaced , shook his head and told his aides it was too high a price to pay . Haunted not only by the prospect of thousands of Americans dead and wounded but also by a nightmarish image of American bodies burned to death by Hussein 's chemical weapons , Bush decided to try diplomacy - at least for now . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , senior administration officials say the Iraqi dictator 's decision not to challenge the United Nations-sponsored naval blockade of his country , along with his bizarre television campaign to portray himself as a kindly uncle to his Western hostages , helped convince the President that Hussein may want to avoid war and that an attack on him now would be premature . <p> Possible deal ? So for the time being , Bush is pursuing a strategy of diplomacy backed up by containment , while the Pentagon continues to gather the heavily armed forces it would need for an all-out war with Iraq . According to senior U.S. officials , the White House foresees one possible deal in which Iraqi troops would be removed from Kuwait and replaced by a U.N . force manned mainly by Americans and backed up by American air and naval forces deployed indefinitely in the Persian Gulf , a formula reminiscent of the 35-year standoff in Korea . Meanwhile , as Bush looks the other way , the Kuwaitis , who may be perfectly willing to buy back their throne , could forge a deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baghdad access to the Persian Gulf and yielding control of a disputed oil field . <p> The President 's current pose could be a smoke screen , giving him time to marshal his forces for a deadly strike . Privately , one senior administration official predicts that if diplomacy has borne no fruit in a month , Bush will review his military options - which by then will be greatly strengthened by the arrival in Saudi Arabia of up to 1,000 top-of-the-line M1 tanks and other heavy armor . It 's also possible that Bush is publicly encouraging negotiations , so that if war does come he can claim that he tried peace first . <p> Even trying to make peace with Hussein , however , will be neither easy nor risk-free . First , the two sides remain far apart . Hussein has declared Kuwait an Iraqi province , but it will be difficult for Bush to accept anything short of the United Nations resolution that demands Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait , restoration of the government , the release of all hostages and stability for Saudi Arabia and the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far from clear that the Iraqi leader is ready to bargain and is not just playing for time in the hope that the coalition against him will disintegrate . " There 's no sign of give on his part , ' argues a senior U.S. official . " The danger of conflict was greatest that first week , but this is a guy who is essentially unpredictable . ' In Baghdad , few people in the streets expect their leader to back down . One American official says that the Iraqi leader " wants to test for weaknesses , " seeing what he can get away with and probing for diplomatic options . The American strategy is to leave Hussein with no options except withdrawal from Kuwait . " If he 's faced with tough choices , ' the American official says of Hussein , " he makes the choice that will enable him to survive . ' <p> But the Iraqis are notorious for making deals when cornered , then breaking them . In 1970 , Baghdad granted Iraq 's Kurdish minority the right to an autonomous region . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1975 , Iraq signed an agreement with Iran to share the Shatt al-Arab waterway that divides the two countries ; five years later , Hussein invaded Iran . <p> Hussein 's track record of treachery means that getting him out of Kuwait will not guarantee " stability " in the Gulf . Senator Richard Lugar , a respected Indiana Republican , argues that since Hussein is working to acquire nuclear weapons and could have them within five years , peace and stability can be assured only by his demise . That view is strongly held in Israel , where military analysts say that if Hussein survives , Israeli warplanes might be compelled to wipe out his budding nuclear capability within 18 months - just as they bombed a nuclear facility at Osirak in 1981 . But if Bush is not willing to use American power to destroy Iraq 's military and economic infrastructure - and to risk the uncertain consequences of crushing Hussein - then he has only two options . <p> Internal ouster . First , he can hope Hussein 's own people will overthrow him . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say his ultimate goal remains the elimination of Hussein . " It would n't disappoint me , " the President admits , " if the Iraqis got up and said , ' Look , this man is our problem . ' ' U.S. and other intelligence agencies have begun working with Iraqi exiles and other opponents of Hussein , but U.S. officials concede that the Iraqi dictator seems secure for now . <p> Second , Bush can hope that international pressure can contain Hussein 's ambitions and weaken his military . In order to succeed , the coalition now arrayed against Iraq must remain cohesive enough to maintain a foolproof arms embargo on Baghdad , a ban on the technology needed to build nuclear weapons , restrictions on Iraqi defense spending and limits on Baghdad 's access to international credit . <p> Bush 's willingness to try containment , at least for a while , rests on a larger assumption : That events in the Middle East have accelerated the emergence of a " new world order . " " There will be a fundamentally different situation in that area , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that collective action will have been shown to work against a case of aggression . ' Adds former Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin : " How this crisis ends will decide the rules of the game in the Middle East and in the post-cold-war era . ' <p> But Bush 's policy of restraint is a product of necessity more than idealism . While the President commands strong support for his deployment of troops , his military options are severely limited by underlying public doubts and by the administration 's difficulty explaining both its real goals and the strategic stakes in the conflict . In a recent Washington Post*ABC poll , only 27 percent supported an invasion of Iraq to force an Iraqi withdrawal . <p> Bush 's maneuvering room is further restricted by his own allies , particularly Arab countries such as Egypt and Syria that have sent troops to Saudi Arabia . If Western Christians start shooting Arab Moslems , leaders of those countries could be driven back into Hussein 's embrace - or overthrown entirely - by popular outrage . " Understand this , " says Jordanian political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Gulf . ' <p> Too expensive ? Bush 's ability to fight also is circumscribed by his ability to pay for a war . Historian Paul Kennedy of Yale University , author of The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers , warns that the United States may be badly overextending its economic resources in the Gulf and that any lengthy stay " will certainly worsen its fiscal position and make it increasingly dependent on foreign capital . ' <p> But if Bush has few easy choices , neither has Hussein . The noose is beginning to tighten around Baghdad . The Soviet Union , Iraq 's old friend , has remained on the sidelines . The sight of Arab troops in the desert alongside American forces would have been unimaginable just a short time ago . The willingness of Japan and other wealthy countries to help finance containment is a critical , if limited , breakthrough . <p> Clearly , the Persian Gulf is unique : Few places are more vital to more countries . But Bush 's dream of a " new world order " is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a basic decision to concentrate on its own economic development , and now that it is more interested in importing technology than exporting revolution , its role in the world has changed profoundly . The U.S. no longer has to worry that sending troops abroad would either trigger a clash with Moscow or leave the West vulnerable to Soviet troublemaking somewhere else . Indeed , the tightening web of international economic relationships has made most countries - including China , which supported the U.N . resolution on Iraq - more vulnerable to such pressures . " If you want to participate in the world economy , ' says Robert Hormats , an international banker and former State Department official , " you ca n't support outlaws . " The same holds true for members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries , who voted to increase production in order to hold down prices . <p> Moscow 's changing definition of its own self-interest also has liberated the United Nations from years of paralysis . The Soviets now see the U.N . as a place where they can exert international influence without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheaper way of maintaining one 's interest on a world scale , ' says Charles William Maynes , editor of Foreign Policy magazine . <p> On the other hand , the Persian Gulf crisis has proved a problem for NATO , which is barred from operating outside its own boundaries . But Helmut Sonnenfeldt , a former State Department official now at the Brookings Institution , says that the Atlantic Alliance has still managed " to inch toward a broader role . " A consensus jelled among the members to participate individually in the defense effort , and countries such as Spain and Turkey which have long refused to allow their bases to be used for non-NATO purposes - relented this time . The allies are also likely to amend their charter next year to increase their flexibility . <p> Still not superpowers . Ironically , the two countries most often touted as new superpowers are blocked by their constitutions from helping to enforce the U.N . embargo against Iraq . Japan waffled before endorsing the economic boycott , causing one newspaper to say the country remained " an economic giant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Tokyo finally announced an aid package of about $1 billionCK , it excluded the use of its funds for direct military purposes . Germany , too , has been a reluctant partner , but after all-German elections are held later this year , the country is expected to amend its Constitution to permit participation in peacekeeping efforts . As Josef Joffe , a German columnist , wrote recently : " Many people in Germany are finally growing up - coming to accept that power breeds responsibility . ' <p> But the U.S. is realizing that collective action , for all its appeal , can limit Washington 's flexibility and decisiveness . After President Bush announced a blockade of Iraq , several allies complained that he was moving too swiftly . Bush - who says he regrets the hasty show of force - put off trying to enforce the sanctions until the U.N . passed a resolution sanctioning the blockade . When Washington asked the Saudis for military support in the Gulf , it meant allowing Riyadh a voice in how and when force is used in the region . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it is only as paymasters , their influence will increase . " We have to let other people call some of the shots , ' says Robert Hunter of the Center for Strategic and International Studies . " We ca n't expect the strategy to be written in Washington and the checks in Tokyo . ' <p> A " new world order " remains a vague and fragile concept . But if longtime allies , old enemies and new rivals can join together to defuse the crisis in the Gulf and prevent Saddam Hussein from mounting a new one , the world will have taken a giant step toward finding a new and better way of dealing with outlaws . <p> Picture , Hurry up and wait . American soldiers try to relax at a Saudi Arabian air base last week before receiving their orders to move out toward the Kuwaiti border , LUC DELAHAYE-SIPA FOR USN &WR; <p> By Steven V. Roberts , Kenneth T. Walsh , Louise Lief , Douglas Stanglin , Jim Impoco , Carla Anne Robbins , David Makovsky , Richard Z. Chesnoff , Jeff Trimble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HIS SIDE Fishing in troubled water <p> George Bush yelped when son Jeb accidentally embedded a fishhook in the President 's right earlobe while casting off the coast of Kennebunkport last week . A White House doctor quickly removed the barb and advised an immediate tetanus shot . But the President soldiered on , trolling for another hour in his speedboat before agreeing to medical treatment . He was rewarded with three bluefish . <p> Bush 's friends and advisers see a lesson in that story . Anyone who thinks that he lacks the perseverance for a prolonged struggle in the Persian Gulf , they say , does not know George Bush . In fact , his decision to try diplomacy and economic sanctions , rather than a quick military strike , to force Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait reflects a familiar pattern in Bush 's life . He is a man of disciplined persistence rather than bold strokes , stubborn to a fault . He is also a man , his closest aides say , showing signs of strain from a much-needed August vacation that was disrupted by the Gulf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ batteries , ' says one aide , describing the President 's mood as increasingly " grumpy . " <p> Bush has been heartened by public support for his careful approach . He even sees signs that a new , post-Vietnam " maturity " is emerging in America , a growing recognition that the U.S. must take risks to stop aggression . But he is plainly worried about the cost . The President was relieved at Budget Director Richard Darman 's private estimate last week that the military intervention will cost substantially less than expected . The budget director said the U.S. expeditionary force will run about $3 billion every six months - and less if the Saudis , Kuwaitis and others help foot the bill as expected . <p> Still , some senior officials are uncomfortable with the administration 's stated willingness to settle for restoring the status quo before Iraq 's invasion of Kuwait without crippling Hussein 's nuclear and chemical-weapons capability . The hawks include Vice President Dan Quayle , Defense Secretary Dick Cheney , Under Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz and Deputy National Security Adviser Robert Gates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose power in a coup as the economic vise tightens - without the loss of American lives . <p> Bush , so often derided for his lack of vision , also has bigger things in mind . During another trolling expedition , this one with National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft , he ruminated about a " new world order " that might emerge from the crisis . In it , the U.S. would forge new alliances with Arab states and work with other " civilized nations " to contain the world 's brigands through the United Nations . Bush concluded that an immediate attack on Iraq would dash that dream . By the end of the morning , he also had landed three 14-pound bluefish . Perseverance paid off , at least in the Gulf of Maine . <p> Picture , Vision . Bush sees a " new world order ' ' , JOANNA B. PINNEO-USN &WR; <p> By Kenneth T. Walsh <p>
