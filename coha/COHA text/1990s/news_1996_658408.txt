<p> ' Pitching to children on a one-to-one basis is like shooting fish in a barrel , " says veteran children 's TV activist Peggy Charren . " It 's so unfair and potentially dangerous that it 's even more important to stop this than it was to get a V-chip for undesirable programs on TV . " <p> Ms. Charren is talking about the problems posed by the Internet , a technology undreamed-of when she began her pioneer work to reform children 's television almost 30 years ago . The big difference : TV is a one-way medium , but the Internet is interactive , and the potential for commercial exploitation is high . <p> Recently the Center for Media Education ( CME ) - a nonprofit , Washington-based research and advocacy group - called on the Federal Trade Commission to do something about ads aimed at children on the new medium , citing their new study . <p> The CME report points to exploitative practices like the micro-targeting of very young children who sit before computers and " visit " the rapidly increasing numbers of manufacturers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of the Internet . There , children can interact in ways designed by advertisers to promote or sell products like cereal or toys . The kids also answer personal questions that yield detailed information , allowing an advertiser to customize his pitch right down to the level of an individual child or family . <p> ' SO now we have yet another way to get children to sit in front of the screen : the computer , " Charren says . And " the qualities that make computers so wonderful for children provide the same technical opportunity that can make Internet advertising aimed at kids so terrible : its ability to deal with their learning level on a one-on-one basis , giving them information as they show themselves ready for it , tapping the delight kids can get from controlling information . " <p> Nielsen Media Research figures show a decline over the past 12 years in the time children spend watching TV , some of it because they are spending more time using computers .. <p> The computer and the Internet have the potential to be " a wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have enough money for nifty CD-ROMs and time to use them . But unfortunately it also opens new avenues - through its interactivity - for kids to be manipulated in ways that television never made possible . " <p> If anyone should know the difference , it 's Charren . Social and media analysts have called her the most important figure in the long , contentious history of children 's TV . Last fall , when President Clinton gave her the Presidential Medal of Freedom , the highest civilian award bestowed by the United States , the citation noted that " while many have decried the quality of television , Peggy Charren has done something about it . " <p> That 's putting it mildly . The group she founded in 1968 , Action for Children 's Television ( ACT ) , spearheaded the reform movement that culminated in the Children 's Television Act of 1990 , a landmark law making service to children a condition for station owners ' keeping their licenses . " I 'm the law 's grandma , " Charren chuckles . " I would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She closed ACT the year the law was passed , but continues as a TV consultant and a visiting scholar at Harvard University 's School of Education . <p> CME is as close to an ACT successor as currently exists . " The CME 's focus on new technology and the child is what we need , " Charren says , pointing to the Internet problem . There are Web sites for all kinds of companies where kids play games , Charren notes . " It 's a good way to hook kids on products early , " she says . " You get this very tight connection of the child to the culture of the corporation . " <p> THIS may sound like a form of education , " but actually it 's a come-on , " she claims . " Kids are asked their names , their addresses , their ages , the names of their friends , their interests . What if the information gets into the hands of someone who wants to sell them something singularly inappropriate or wants to entice them to do something you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she says , are the latest step in the sad story of commercial exploitation of kids in the media . For decades , a " synergy " has existed between broadcasters and toy companies that " has nothing to do with the family 's interests , " she says . <p> " On TV shows like ' GI Joe ' and ' My Little Pony , ' it 's practically impossible to tell advertising from the editorial content , " she says . " The characters ca n't wear clothes any different from the toy . In fact , there 's a set of guidelines from the toy companies that should make any rational person 's hair stand on end . " <p> Yet television , for all its problems , is a one-way street , Charren points out . The Nielsen ratings provide a very loose demographic picture : They do n't tell you who the audience is or what their preferences are . " And they certainly do n't give you their name and address , " she notes . But on the Web , she says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't pretend to have a perfect solution . But from her background as a children 's TV activist , she says : " If we separate the needs of children from the needs of everyone else , that 's a rational way to begin . " And one way or another , she adds , " We do need to get parents to understand it 's not a good idea for your child to be wurbling secrets to any stranger that comes down the electronic pike . " <p> PROTECTING KIDS ON THE WEB <p> Under the ominous title " Web of Deception , " a report by the Washington-based Center for Media Education ( CME ) details marketing practices aimed at young users of the Internet . <p> In Netscape 's KidsCom , for instance , a little cartoon-character man stands on a pool of water with a word balloon over his head saying " I 'm a kid that needs to register . " A user clicks here and is asked questions like " What kind of computer do you now have ( " IBM , " " MacIntosh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - KidsKash - tells children they will win credits called KidsKash they can use to claim " loot " ( including a case of Nabisco cookies ) by answering questions like " What brand of athletic shoe do you wear most often ? " and " Who buys your athletic shoes ? " <p> Elsewhere on the Internet , Microsoft 's " Splash Kids " asks children questions about themselves as a preliminary to becoming one of the Splash Kids and offers them a chance to win a Sony Discman as part of a monthly giveaway if they sign up . Big letters on the screen say " Sign-up and Win ! " with a picture of the Discman underneath . <p> CME investigated the world of on-line advertising to children and found two basic threats : the tracking of children 's on-line computer use and the solicitation of information from them ; and what CME calls unfair , deceptive advertising , such as " infomercials " for children - electronic advertising " environments " in which children play with brand-name characters . <p> CME has called on the Federal Trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect children . CME is not against advertising to children in cyberspace , it states , but wants children to be treated fairly and appropriately . <p> The organization suggests these industry guidelines : Personal information should not be collected from minors ; ads for kids should be labeled as such ; interaction should not take place between a child and a product spokesperson ; and no micro-targeting of kids or direct-response marketing should be conducted . <p> *Tomorrow : Teaching media literacy in schools , Page 10.
