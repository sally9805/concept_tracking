Fifteen years ago , Dr. Terry Ernest , an ophthalmologist , had to tell his own father the news that he so dreaded giving his patients : Your eyesight is progressively deteriorating , and there is no cure for the condition . Despite tremendous medical progress in treating many forms of vision loss , Ernest could do nothing but watch as his father 's eyesight slowly faded , eventually robbing him of the pleasure of pursuing the pages of his favorite books or seeing the smile on his son 's face . " At one point , I actually apologized to my father for all the tuition he 'd paid , " says Ernest . " I had to say to him , ' I 'm sorry . There 's absolutely nothing I can do . ' " <P> Earlier this year , a team of University of Chicago physicians led by Ernest and surgeon Dr. Samir Patel performed a complex operation on Pearl Van Vliet , a retired medical-center receptionist who was suffering from the same condition that had deprived Ernest 's father of his sight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the eye 's macula , a remarkably sensitive structure in the middle of the retina , gradually loses its ability to distinguish shapes and colors . <P> In a delicate procedure that lasted more than two hours , Ernest and his team tried a new and hopeful approach to macular degeneration . They first took cells from the retina of an aborted fetus , then surgically transplanted them into Van Vliet 's severely impaired left eye . Since the operation , the transplanted cells have begun to proliferate , forming minute projections that stretch toward Van Vliet 's macula . For Ernest , a large , affable man of 62 , the weekly ritual of scrutinizing the eye scans that chronicle Van Vliet 's recovery from surgery proved intensely satisfying , not only professionally but also because of his frustrating experience with his father , who died in 1992 . <P> Even now , however , Ernest and his colleagues can not be certain they are on the right track . Too many promising treatments for macular degeneration , they caution , have failed to produce discernible benefits . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are on to something basic , then eventually ophthalmologists will be able to help their patients , perhaps not to cure macular degeneration ( that would be too much to hope for ) , but at least to stop its relentless progression . <P> To be sure , macular degeneration , which currently affects an estimated 10 million Americans , is not a fatal disorder . But it can be cruelly debilitating . For while the macula ( named after the Latin word for spot ) is no wider than a pencil , it is a hundred times more sensitive to small-scale features than the rest of the retina . Without a healthy macula , people can not read a newspaper , recognize a friend , thread a needle , watch TV , safely negotiate stairs or see much of anything at all . <P> Until now , physicians have been able to offer only palliative care to patients with macular degeneration : more powerful eyeglasses ; visual aids , such as machines that enlarge print ; and , for a minority of cases  --  those that involve the invasive growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disease , at least for a time . But only 10% of those in whom macular degeneration is diagnosed develop this more rapidly progressing , invasive form of the disease . For them , experts agree , intervention is needed earlier , before so much visual acuity is lost .
