HER MOTHER WAS A SHEEP-dog , the pride of her valley  --  where a good working dog was worth her weight in scarce silver coin . Sheep needed to range far to scour a meal from the steep mountainsides that ringed the valley round , and a shepherd needed legs more tireless than his own to bring a flock back safe to the fold ere darkness fell and wolves were a certainty . Strong and clever was Mai 's mother , always guiding her charges home no matter how mountains and weather tested her , and her first litter was eagerly awaited , as if she were a king 's wife brought to bed of royal heirs . <p> Mai was the seventh and the last-born , all of the pups wet and wiggling , looking  --  and squeaking  --  quite like rats , save for the splashes of white on their black or brown fur . The litter shared a warm nest of rags by the fireside in the shepherd 's tiny hut , shared also their mother 's good milk , jostling about to get as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mai , forward and bold , was always well fed , her brown and white body plump as a young coney 's . <p> After a fortnight , six pairs of puppy eyes opened , showed a deep babyish blue color , then settled to a wise brown , the same as their mother 's . Mai 's eyes , however , opened and remained blue as the inside of an ice cave , paler than the shell of a robin 's egg . The shepherd at first feared her blind  --  then , seeing that notion proved unfounded by her obviously sighted play with her littermates , feared far worse . <p> Six of the weaned puppies went to new homes after the Market Fair . Mai went for a walk , tagging along behind the shepherd with nary a sheep in sight . They left their valley , followed a river a little way , until they came to a cottage builded of smooth river stones and sticky river mud , thatched with silver-green river rushes . There was a man tending herbs in the dooryard , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mai to him . <p> " You may be wrong , " the wizard Corlinn said gently . " Sometimes a blue-eyed dog simply has blue eyes . " <p> " Her mother had proper brown eyes , " the shepherd insisted , twisting his cap in his hands . <p> " And the father ! " <p> " That 's what worries me , sir . Suppose some mountain spirit came upon her  --  " <p> The wizard dismissed the superstition , though he did not expect for a moment that the shepherd would follow his will and do likewise . He bent to the puppy , fondled her soft brown ears , which stood tall only to droop over at the tips . She lowered them in pleasure at his notice , and wiggled all over . Unable to long contain such overmastering joy , she sprang up so that Corlinn had to step hastily back , nearly falling , unable to avoid her wet nose and dirty paws . He did evade most of the wet kisses the puppy sought to bestow , to the pup 's dismay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her by her ruff , held her down and spoke sternly . The puppy stared past him as if his words had no connection with any world she knew , then struggled to be free of his fingers , not too polite to add teeth to her weapons . <p> " She 's strong-willed  --  and were she human , a trial to any father ! " Corlinn chuckled . " But she 's merely a dog . An ordinary dog , " the wizard stressed . <p> " You 're sure ? " Uncertainly . " Sir ? " <p> Corlinn looked again , with all the Sight he possessed . But though the ice-blue eyes were unusual , even unnerving , they were in no wise demonic . He nodded . <p> " Will you take her , sir ? " <p> " I ? " The wizard transferred his gaze and attention from dog to shepherd with some surprise and no little difficulty . " I have just said , she is only a dog . Even if she were . . . as you thought . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am in retirement here , and puppies are inconducive to rest and study , whether they be witchbred or not . Take her ? No , not likely . " <p> The shepherd nodded and replaced his cap , prepared to go . He snapped his fingers for Mai , who left off sniffing at an herb-plot to frisk back to his side , her earlier scolding forgotten the instant ' t was heard  --  if it had been heard at all . <p> " What will you do with her ? " the wizard wondered , his tongue taking his ears by surprise . But it could hardly be a bargaining trick  --  no mention of price had been made . <p> The shepherd frowned down at the leggy pup , her tail curling over her back and waving gently side to side . " What I 'd have done when she was born , if I 'd known . ' T is kinder when they 're small . " <p> " Because of her eyes ? " the wizard asked , a chill of realization striking through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing against the weight of peasant lore . " Just because they 're blue ? " <p> " Because I always cull the weak ones , or the deformed . Same as w ' the sheep . " <p> " She 's healthy . " Protest , as much as observation . <p> " Aye . And what else besides ? I wo n't foul your river , sir , never fear . " The shepherd squared his shoulders , under the fleece he wore for warmth . " There 's a fast-running beck nearer to home , ' twill serve . " <p> The puppy spied a butterfly , and bounced stiff-legged to challenge and chase , blissfully unaware of her impending fate . <p> " Besides , sir , she 's got no herding touch , " the shepherd explained . " Her mother rounded up the falling leaves , at this age . The rest of her litter could n't bear to see chair parted from table , but they must herd it back to its place . This one  --  only wants to chase . No use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have done with familiars , Corlinn thought stemly . I have no sheep , nor desire a flock . No work for a dog  --  I will not keep a pet . <p> He had not bred the pup . He had not judged her unfit to live . He had merely been asked his opinion , and then been ignored . He bore no responsibility  --  he had not sentenced her to death on a superstition , though that sentence had been passed in his heating . That he could alter it did not mean that he must . He bore no obligation . <p> The shepherd snapped his fingers again to call the pup , but she chose to take her leave of Corlinn first , and gazed up at him with those summer-sky eyes , her ears lowered with delight even though he had not acknowledged her , her tail thrashing fiercely , making a breeze . <p> He cursed himself for every sort of fool , but Corlinn kept her , and kept the name the shepherd 's wife had given her : Mai . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew . Corlinn , who saw her each and every day , took no especial note of the continual small changes  --  till he realized that when she reared up and put her generally muddy paws on his shoulders , she could very nearly look him in the eye  --  and he was by no means a stocky man . Any height Mai might have lacked was quite made up by the length of her muzzle  --  it put her tongue in easy reach of every part of his face , however he twisted to avoid its caress . <p> When he could hold her at sufficient length to get a proper look at her , Corlinn 's eyes beheld a body like a blooded horse 's  --  long and slender , on very long legs . Her coat , neither long nor short , was a pleasant honey-brown color , tipped with black , pied with white irregularly on her legs , throat , chest , and a stripe down the middle of her face . The tip of her ever-waving tail looked as if it had been dipped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whilst the other often flew gaily off to one side , and both flicked to follow every sound , missing nothing . Mai looked nothing like a mountain sheepdog . She was , in every part , as exotic as her eyes . <p> Mai was fond of racing about the cottage in an excess of high spirits , as if fiends were on her track , her back humped and all of her paws briefly occupying the selfsame spot , sliding wildly on the polished dirt as she turned . Her speed dazzled as much as it distressed  --  Corlinn was often not in time to rescue some bottle or pot from disaster because he could not imagine it even remotely to be in danger . He thought to banish the creature from the cottage  --  a dog should be kenneled outside anyway . Mai howled till he did not know which of them he pitied the more . Corlinn steeled himself to ignore her noise , which would surely cease when she resigned herself to her fate . The howling did not abate . It grew frenzied , hysterical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corlinn relented , and opened the door . Mai tumbled in . The face of the door was scarred from her frantic attempts to gain entry . It looked as if a bear had been at it . She fell asleep at his feet , all innocence and having quite forgiven him for locking her out . <p> Such peace was a rare novelty . Mai enjoyed dragging Corlinn 's cloak to the floor , to lie upon  --  and to chew the hem out of , so that he discovered the garment soggy and ripped , shoved under the bedstead . He reprimanded the puppy sternly  --  and often . But if she could not obtain the cherished cloak , Mai was happy to chew on his books  --  removing them carefully from the shelves first , while she selected the most toothsome among them . Height was no obstacle , not to Mai . Corlinn 's boots also suffered , were pocked by teeth . The dog found the tended earth of the herb garden ideal for crafting holes  --  a practice Corlinn generally discovered when , wondering why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he stepped outdoors and literally stumbled upon the destruction . He forbade her to sleep on his bed , yet there each dawning was Mai , crept stealthily in after he had dropped off , curled at his back . As she grew , she took a larger share of bed and blanket , heedlessly . <p> Then , she began to wander . To the river , where she learned to swim by leaping dauntlessly into the water  --  frightening the pike Corlinn was clumsily attempting to lure into his fish-weir . Into the woods  --  where she found smelly things without number , to be rolled in , their stench fetched proudly home like a trophy . If she found naught else , there was always mud  --  Mai would come home covered with it , ears to paws , and share out her bounty gladly with a clean cloak or bedcover . <p> All these things distressed , but what Corlinn minded most was her nose , thrust suddenly and coldly into his ribs or the side of his elbow while he was peaceably engaged in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouted . Several times he was minded to return the blow , no matter that Mai meant it only as a friendly greeting , or a request for his attention . He forbore , mostly , because his guilt afterward much eclipsed any fleeting satisfaction got from his churlish behavior . <p> Corlinn told himself that Mai was older every day  --  that surely matters would change for the better by the end of the coming winter , when she would be more mature , more settled . But it remained true that he had retreated to this lonely spot because it was lonely . He had not desired company , even a dog 's , and there were many times he heartily wished he had let the shepherd take Mai away , to whatever fate would have been hers . Cats , owls , snakes - those were the proper familiars for a wizard who desired the advantage of their link to animal wisdom  --  not a reckless , enthusiastic , reckless puppy . In short , Corlinn remembered that he had never wanted a dog , and chose to forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will , Mai from time to time looked at things that were not there  --  especially when winter 's shrill winds blew . Corlinn knew this was no sign of magic  --  he was with her each day , every night . Mai was a bright dog , a demanding one , willful as any father-coddled princess , but she earned no taint of the extraordinary . Her blue eyes , once one was accustomed to them , were simply blue , unusual by no more than their hue . They saw what any dog saw  --  which was not much . Dogs relied upon keen noses , above sight . And ears , which explained her attention to the wind . <p> By the mid of winter , the wizard was wondering why it had not occurred to him earlier to simply apply his arts to the puppy  --  it would be a small thing to change blue eyes to common brown for a week or two , and trade her to some herder in need of a good dog . A flock of sheep to look after would settle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mischief . He would , of course , need to take her a valley or two away , lest Mai be traced back to him when the spell faded and her eyes were blue once more . That required that he wait for a break in the weather , a reliable week or two in which to travel . Mai , who looked up in surprise from uprooting a potted chive clump when he shouted , was all unwitting of her future . No , those blue eyes did not gift a special sight . <p> RUNNING water is a bane to wizards , for even the mightiest of them dare cross its unbridled power only at great peril . Thus had Corlinn sited his cottage where he did  --  the river was as good as a wall at his back , in case of sorcerous attack . Likewise the water-smoothed stones , the river mud and rushes he had used to build his home  --  washed so long by the flowing water , they retained its properties to the extent that no ill-wish could work harm upon them . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbridged river . <p> Winters in the backlands seemed harsher than those of the tamed city  --  the swift-running river froze right over , shore to shore , thick enough that the deer could be seen crossing upon the ice , fearlessly . Mai also ran out eagerly upon the solid surface , uncaring about the cold , unheeding of the icy water rushing two feet below , mindlessly happy to extend her range of mischief . Corlinn was never tempted to such recklessness , himself . He walked  --  well bundled  --  along the shore , admiring the patterns of ice and snow , the many shades of white and gray , the rare blue that was a match for Mai 's eyes , till his cheeks burned and his toes ached with cold . Then he turned homeward . <p> As the season began to wane , the days to lengthen ever so slightly , he tramped with a propose , seeking signs of the first blossom of the skunk cabbage on the low ground by the river . The plants not only survived the snow  --  they actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to melt their way into the sunlight . Corlinn made use of that property each year , to succor delicate herbs he had brought from the City , plants unable to bear the disturbance of indoor potting but too tender to withstand the snows they struggled to sprout through . He looked eagerly for the unlovely flowers , anxious to bank his plants with them for a critical few days . <p> The winter creaked to a dose  --  literally . The river ice began to groan faintly in the morning , the sound waxing as the day and the sunlight grew . The noise abated only a trifle in the night  --  and suddenly there was a rumble like distant thunder which shook the wizard from his sleep  --  and he knew the released river was rushing past his house , its water studded with chunks of ice , spilling down the floodplain as it did with every spring thaw . Mai startled at the sound  --  he gave her a reassuring pat before remembering to forbid her the bed . Corlinn returned peacefully to his slumbers  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water 's reach even at this season . <p> The morning was misty , the air a fog that rose from the warming banks of snow , the sky above overcast and admitting no visible rays of sun , though letting its heat through . Corlinn went out early  --  with Mai noising eagerly ahead  --  to see whether damage had been done to the riverbanks . The air smelled faintly of skunk cabbage . <p> The wraith always appeared in this very early spring , so Corlinn was not surprised to see the pale figure drifting along the far shore , among the gray trees . One day she would linger , two at most , always at the wane of the moon , clutching her bundle to her . Once , he had heard a thin cry come over the water , which told him much  --  a woman and her baby , both dead in childbirth , wandering until they reached the running water of the river , which no shade could cross . They must have died at this season , unguessably long ago . The woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk for a short time each year , each spring . Corlinn spared the wraith a touch of pity , but he had no remedy to offer . If only she could once manage to appear before the ice broke up  --  but always she was too late , often by a week or two , most poignantly by a mere few hours , as this year . <p> Mai was questing along the water 's edge , harking at the floating ice , sniffing at rocks turned over by the flood , digging into any soft spots she managed to find . She began to roll on some small object  --  she must have found a dead fish , swept along and cast ashore . It would be too fresh and too cold to have ripened fully enough to suit her , but Mai persisted . Corlinn sighed , and wondered if he could get himself indoors without her noticing , bar the portal so she 'd have to remain out in the air a while . Or would she only find more dirt ? Had frozen mud begun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see whether she was noticing him . Mai was not  --  she was by the water , on her feet , staring across at the far side . Doubtless she regretted those woodlands now beyond her reach  --  or would she attempt swimming across ? Corlinn hoped she would not  --  the water still carried a freight of ice , and she would take herself into a danger he could not save her from . Perhaps he should call her to him  --  <p> She was watching the wraith , Corlinn realized with a start . He had no notion just what she saw , but her attention was directed rather obviously . She stalked stiff-legged toward the water , her gaze never shifting . <p> Reaching the cold water , the dog did not halt , but began to trot back and forth , anxiously . Still , she looked across the stream , into the bare woodland . Once she looked back over her shoulder at Corlinn , her blue eyes startling even at a fair distance . He waved to her , and called her name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore , Mai watched the white chunks of ice bobbing in the black water , scattering and milling , separated from one another . That was wrong , should not be . She barked at the white shapes , but they did not heed her . <p> No wayward sheep had ever successfully defied Mai 's mother . Mai was  --  blue eyes or not  --  her mother 's true daughter . She lowered her head , stretched her neck out , and stalked in a half-crouch toward the fractious river . She speared the nearest ice chunk with her winter-blue gaze . She did not growl , nor bare a fang , but with her whole posture she threatened the disordered flock of ice floes . <p> A small block  --  which had been sweeping toward the gravelly shore - shuddered to a sudden halt . Another block bumped it , jammed against it , was also halted . In an instant more the whole surface of the fiver had done likewise , as the reaction spread from one shore to the other . The ice was smooth and flat no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through which running black water could be glimpsed  --  but most of the flow was covered by piled-up chunks of ice , held in their places by Mai 's commanding sheepdog stare . <p> Corlinn looked wide-eyed at the scene . Mai waved her white-tipped tail once  --  not at him , but in signal to the opposite shore . And an insubstantial white figure set a hesitant foot upon the nearest block . <p> Apparently the rough surface was solid enough . The wraith flitted across , quick as a breeze , almost as difficult to make out . It passed within a yard of Mai , who shook her fur and let all the ice go skittering on its way , in a second , smaller flood of released water . Leaping back from the slopping bank , the dog pointed her long nose toward the nearer woods , a little way downstream . <p> Corlinn looked that way too  --  and the hair rose prickling on the nape of his neck . A second pale wraith stood among the bare tree trunks , where he had never seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form , with a suggestion  --  faint and best seen out of the comer of the eye , hard to make out dead-on  --  of a shield and a sword . A soldier , dead in some long ago battle . <p> Dead , and unable to wed his sweetheart , or claim his child . Separated from them forever by running water . . . <p> As Corlinn stared , the slender white form rushed toward the heavier one , was enfolded in it . Just for an instant , the little flock was gathered all together , as it should be . Then , ' t was gone . The sun ate through the fog , and the river water began to sparkle , the white ice became impossible to gaze upon . His eyes watered . <p> Mai came romping out of the dazzle , unseen , and leaped up to plant her paws on Corlinn 's shoulders . She did stink of dead fish  --  Corlinn found he did not care . He hugged her tight to him . Mai wriggled to be free of his grip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Sometimes a blue-eyed dog is just a blue-eyed dog , " the wizard recalled , grunting as the dog poked her overlong nose into his left armpit , trying to persuade him to lift the arm and put it to use scratching her . " With no herding instinct . And sometimes a wizard is simply wrong . " <p> Yes , Mai agreed . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : " Still , it is the hand that feeds us .
