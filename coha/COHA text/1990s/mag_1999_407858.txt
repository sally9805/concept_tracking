Alaska Scouts follow in the footsteps of fortune as they chug up the Chilkoot Trail . // Gold ! " yelled the miner as he lifted the yellow nugget from his pan . The Klondike Gold Rush of 1897 had begun . News of the world 's richest gold strike triggered thousands of people to leave their homes , farms and jobs and head for Canada 's Yukon Territory during the winter of 1897 . Most of them chose the fastest route to the Klondike , over the treacherous Chilkoot Trail , an Indian footpath running from southeast Alaska to British Columbia . " Cold ! " yelled First Class Scout Kevin Vik after he and Second Class Scout David Baker cannonballed into a pool of snowmelt water at the top of Chilkoot Pass . Unlike the prospectors who had followed the call of fortune more than 100 years earlier , no one followed Kevin 's call into the icy pool . Not for all the gold in the Yukon . An Anniversary Hike The Chilkoot Trail is a rugged 33-mile path that roller  --  coasters from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chilkoot Pass and on to Lake Bennett in Canada . It has been called the world 's longest museum because tin cans , boots , bottles , stoves , wagon axles , boats and other items discarded by old-time prospectors litter the trail . More than 20,000 so-called " stampeders " made the difficult trek to the gold fields over the Chilkoot Trail . To celebrate the centennial of the Klondike Gold Rush , Troop 230 , Eagle River , Alaska , retraced the prospectors ' steps over five days last August . " Most hikes are just hikes , " Life Scout Daniel Dieffenderfer said . " This one was special because we walked where the miners walked 100 years ago . " To Sleep at Sheep Camp Over the first two days of the trek , the Scouts covered about 13 miles in mild temperatures ranging from the 50 's to the 70 's . The trail took them through green forests of towering Douglas fir and Sitka spruce , to alpine meadows , rocky canyons and- " ouch , " slap , " ow , " smack  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Remains of many of these boats line the Chilkoot area , " the world 's longest museum . // The Scouts saw bald eagles overhead and mountain goats on the hills and came across an old boiler used to power a tram that helped gold-rush prospectors along the trail . In the evening in their tents , at a place called Sheep Camp , the Scouts jotted notes about their trail experiences in journals . " All day I was sweating like a pig and drinking like a hog , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sore and I wan na sleep , so I am ending this by saying Do n't Underestimate the Chilkoot . This is Awesome ! " ' The Golden Staircase The Scouts crept out of their sleeping bags at 5:30 A.M. , which was n't as hard as it may sound . After all , it was daylight . This being summer in Alaska , the sun had pretty much never gone down . The Scouts tanked up on a breakfast of oatmeal and hot chocolate , put on their packs and began their toughest day of hiking yet , a rocky , 1,000-foot ascent of Chilkoot Pass . After a few hours of hiking , the boys stepped out of the trees and got their first glimpse of the steep , rocky pass . A few weeks before the hike , Troop 230 had watched a slide show of the same hike their troop took 20 years earlier . The trail in the pictures looked exactly like what lay ahead of them now : the Golden Staircase .

" Let 's hike the summit in full uniform . " So , they changed out of their sweaty clothes and into crisp uniforms and began the steep ascent over slippery , loose rock . Twice , the Scouts thought they had reached the top of the pass . " Aw , another false summit , " cried Life Scout Kyle Cuzzort , looking up the trail with his hands on his hips . " We 're not there yet . " The weather was warm . The sun poked through the white , puffy clouds that clung to the mountaintops . It was a glorious day to reach the summit . And , by midafternoon , they did just that . " That was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First Class Scout Sean Winslow , catching his breath at the top of the pass . The troop spent about three hours at the summit , taking photographs , exploring the artifacts left by the miners-and watching Kevin Vik and David Baker turn blue in that icy pool . Resuming their journey , they crested the pass and entered the Yukon Territories . The day after the summit hike , the Scouts covered nine hard miles . If it had n't been for the conditioning hikes the troop had taken before the trek , they might have felt miserable . When Troop 230 awoke the next day , almost no one ate breakfast . The Scouts knew there would be hot sourdough pancakes waiting for them five miles away at the end of the trail at Lake Bennett . In celebration of the Gold Rush anniversary , the Chilkoot Trail Centennial Committee cooked a free breakfast for all hikers . That afternoon , well-fed and weary , the Scouts boarded a train on the famed White Pass railroad bound for Skagway and the trip home . " I could go for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , savoring the end of the trek . " They were the best I 've ever tasted . " Bob Keefe agreed . " This whole Chilkoot experience was the high point of my life as a Scout . I would n't trade it for anything . " Not even a sack of Klondike gold . THE KLONDIKE GOLD RUSH On Aug. 17 , 1896 , three men searched for gold on a branch of the Klondike River called Rabbit Creek . They were Yukon natives Skookum Jim and Tagish Charlie and their American friend , George Carmack . They found gold , staked their claims and renamed the creek " Bonanza . " By today 's prices , the gold taken from that area would be worth more than a billion dollars . The following summer two steamships brought the prospectors and their gold south . A Seattle newspaper report told of " more than a ton of gold " to be divided among 68 miners , aboard one of the ships . The story quickly spread around the world by telegraph  --  and the Klondike Gold Rush began . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who eventually set out for the Yukon ever made it to Dawson City . And of those who did , only a handful found enough gold to make them rich in seven years , more than $96 million ( in 1903 dollars ) worth of gold had been mined from the Yukon creeks . Ten years after the after the discovery of gold , the rush was over .
