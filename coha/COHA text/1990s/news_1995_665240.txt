<p> For former Mideast hostage Terry Anderson , going back to Vietnam to visit a school under construction was like finding a rainbow at the end of two personal nightmares . <p> Actually on a recent day a rainbow did arch across the rice paddies where Anderson used to hump a 60-pound pack , as our convoy of two minivans bumped along bomb-rutted Highway One , infamous as ' La Rue Sans Joie " - the street without joy - since the days of the French Indochina War . <p> The whole purpose of Anderson 's trip was to merge those two nightmares out of his past with a recurring dream of a bright future for Vietnam 's war-forsaken children . <p> To keep from cracking up during his 6 years of captivity in Lebanon , where he had been an Associated Press correspondent , Anderson kept his mind occupied with all sorts of future projects . For weeks on end he and fellow captive Tom Sutherland , an agriculture professor , drew up detailed plans for a dairy farm that would be staffed by juvenile delinquents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they told themselves as they designed buildings , projected budgets and even picked out the herd . <p> Chained to a wall night and day , Anderson also wrote poems that willed himself away to another place and time from that rodent-ridden , windowless cell . A poem titled " I Am Not Here Most Days " took him back 15 years to his tour as a Marine sergeant in Vietnam . <p> " I stumble wearily through Indochinese jungle , " he wrote on the scroll of memory , because paper and pencil were denied , " soaked with sweat and fear , trembling with adrenalined excitement , peering through thick brush for unimpressive men with impressive , hating eyes . " <p> And here he was back in Vietnam , meeting with some of those men who might have peered at him out of the jungle but were now peering with friendly eyes at the drawings and budgets for his dream school . Not a dairy school - " dreams change with reality , " Terry admits - but an elementary school built with donations from American veterans in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poorest in Vietnam . <p> Quang Tri borders the DMZ , the demilitarized zone that once separated North and South Vietnam . In the path of three decades of war , the province was successively decimated by Vietminh mortars , French armored columns , Russian rockets , ARNV ( Army of the Republic of Vietnam ) artillery , North Vietnamese tanks and carpet bombing B-52s . <p> More than 12,000 children in the area have never been to school . Quang Tri , like much of Vietnam , once boasted a 90 percent literacy rate . Today some 16,000 are illiterate , largely because almost every schoolhouse , classroom and blackboard has been blown away , along with many of the teachers . <p> Twenty years after the fall of Saigon , the Communist government is so impoverished that children have to pay for books and supplies . Some pay to attend class . In some areas the Hanoi government has allowed Catholic schools to reopen to educate children too poor to afford public schools . <p> But now Dong Ha 's new school is nearly half completed , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were tossing up bricks to the bricklayers and climbing a ladder to join the carpenters . <p> " This will be the finest school in Vietnam , " he shouted down . <p> The first school to be built with donations from Vietnam vets will be dedicated to the memory of another Marine , the late Lew Puller Jr. , who came up with the original idea . <p> Young Puller , the son of Gen. Lewis " Chesty " Puller , the Marine Corps ' most-decorated hero , stepped on a howitzer shell booby trap while on patrol in terrain similar to the rice paddies and bamboo thickets surrounding the school site . He lost both legs almost to the hip and was left with just enough fingers on one hand to peck out " Fortunate Son , " the autobiography that won him the Pulitzer Prize . It starkly chronicles his final wheelchair battles with depression and alcoholism . <p> Slogging through the mud of the proposed schoolyard with a copy of the blueprints in his hand , Anderson recounted how meeting a Vietnamese actress at the Vietnam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Vietnam in his wheelchair . <p> " When I came home from Lebanon , one of the first things I did was go to the Wall , " Anderson says . " It had gone up while I was held hostage , and what a marvelous place of healing it is . I was asked to speak at the Wall and met Kieu Chinh , the Vietnamese actress who was featured in ' The Joy Luck Club . ' She took part in reading the names off the Wall and suddenly asked about her people . What about all the Vietnamese who died in the fighting . Where 's the reconciliation ? " <p> " Her questions really hooked me , " Anderson said , with lingering emotion . " We got some Vietnam vets together with the idea of remembering the Vietnamese who died on both sides . We wanted to make some gesture that had nothing to do with politics or the government . <p> " Lew Puller volunteered to go back and find out what the Vietnamese themselves thought would be a suitable memorial . He spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amputees like himself , and found out one thing they do n't need was another pile of rocks . Lew suggested a living memorial , maybe a school or a hospital , so we settled on rebuilding schools blown away in the war . " <p> Thus the Vietnamese Memorial Association was born , with Kieu Chinh and Anderson as co-chairs . Washington attorney John Wheeler , who spearheaded fund raising for the Vietnam Wall , came on board as president . The author of " Touched With Fire , the Future of the Vietnam Generation , " Wheeler is a Vietnam vet from the West Point Class of l966 , which suffered the most wounded and killed in the war . <p> After touring the construction site , Anderson crossed a drained rice paddy to visit the existing tin-roofed elementary school which looked like a movie set left over from a John Ford frontier epic : a single room with exposed beam rafters , long wooden benches , no electricity and a blackboard that 40 years before had displayed French military operations . <p> It was lunch time . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth from the classroom , excitedly chattering their curiosity about the American visitors . Blushing and shy , they gathered round their teacher , Trinh Trieu Le , to have their pictures taken with Anderson . <p> They were going home now , the teacher explained , because Quang Tri was so short of schools and teachers that grades one through five attend in the morning , while the sixth through eighth grades came in the afternoon . <p> As a Marine passing through their villages , Anderson had developed a special fondness for the children of Vietnam . They always lifted his spirits after encounters with snipers in the tree line , night ambushes , hairy spiders , poisonous snakes and " heat and humidity that would rot your fatigues in two weeks . " <p> For the better part of an hour , he wore out the interpreter chatting and joking with giggling boys and girls . " Vietnamese kids are absolutely beautiful , always smiling , " he says . " No matter how bad a day it 's been , they grab hold of your emotions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dong Ha Peoples Committee took place in the second-floor conference room of the local party headquarters , curiously decorated with lace curtains , the requisite portrait of Ho Chi Minh and brush-stroke prints of Vietnamese cavalry on the backs of elephants defeating the invading Mongol armies of Kublai Khan 700 years ago . Nothing in the decor suggested the recent war . <p> Committee Vice Chairman Nguyen Xuan Anh presented Anderson with an artist 's rendering of the two-floor , 12-room school which he said would enroll 325 pupils and consolidate several small hamlet schools . <p> " Work is on schedule , " the vice chairman proudly reported , " and barring a late winter typhoon , the building should be ready for occupancy on April 30 . " <p> Construction costs had remained within the $ 75,000 budgeted by the American donors , he continued , and the local community had raised an additional $ 30,000 through taxes to strengthen the foundation , fence in the playground and erect a separate building for toilet facilities . However , this extra work , he added with some embarrassment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hoping the Americans could assist there . Anderson said he would refer the problem to his board of directors but did not sound very encouraging . <p> There was " yet another problem , " the vice chairman sighed audibly . " The contractor has not received any money yet . " It seems the central bank in Hanoi has no infrastructure for allocating the funds deposited by the Vietnamese Memorial Association to the local bank . The lack of diplomatic relations between Vietnam and the United States was blamed for delaying the currency transfer . <p> Anderson agreed to pressure officials at home and in Hanoi into coming up with a solution . He told the committee that many American firms and individuals had offered to donate books and supplies but his group held off accepting any until they found out what local educators needed most . <p> With that , the local education chairman reached into his briefcase and produced a wish list of 32 items . Lo , a computer led all the rest . This led to speculation among the visitors that the Dong Ha school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a computer and outdoor plumbing . <p> Anderson , in reply to the committee 's progress report , said he was " happy to see the work proceeding so quickly . This school , which we hope is the prototype for many to come , is the gift of hundreds of ordinary people who gave small amounts to bring our two countries together . They regard it as a living monument to the men , women and children who died during the war , as well as a way of helping the children of Vietnam today . " <p> As an example of reconciliation and forgiveness , Anderson said he was " proud to introduce Cole Black , who spent 6 years as a guest of your government in Hanoi . " <p> Black , a Navy pilot from Escondido , Calif. , had been shot down over North Vietnam and was imprisoned in the Hanoi Hilton almost as long as Terry was held hostage in Lebanon . Just two days before , while passing through downtown Hanoi on a tour bus , Cole looked out the window and saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his early manhood was being torn down to build a luxury hotel . He persuaded the driver to stop , ran into the courtyard and collected some of the dingy yellow bricks to send as souvenirs to other former inmates . <p> The Vietnamese Memorial Association envisions building 40 more schools in the next five years . " For every $ 50,000 we raise , " Wheeler says , " the government is committed to build another school . The next one is scheduled for Ho Chi Minh City , then one at the very north of Vietnam , near the Chinese border , and the next in the Mekong Delta . " <p> Dong Ha , he admits , was chosen as the site of the first school because " besides being in the poorest area , its location is geographically and politically correct : right on the border between the former North and South Vietnam .
