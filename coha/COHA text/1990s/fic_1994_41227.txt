Moira went for Brawith at the Vets Hospital despite the fact everybody told her it would not work out , and should he get worse , she would bear the blame for his death . There was no way for him to get well , the same people claimed , and all her trouble would go for nothing . But Moira was his grandmother , she reminded everyone , and so she took him home to Flempton where she had a nice property near the copse . The river is close by , and there are lots of woodlands and the town is only about a mile or so due west an a gravel road not too bad to walk on . <p> Brawith had been nearly made a sieve of from the war , as people in the hospital said , whether from bullets or an explosion or from both factors . <p> Brawith seldom spoke . When you asked him questions he blinked and looked at his nails . <p> Moira did not know how bad off he was until he had been home with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too late to be sorry . She was to have many a heartache over her decision to take him from the Vets Hospital , but if she sometimes was sorry , she never let on to anybody about what she felt . <p> Her cousin Keith came in occasionally and shook his head but said nothing and left after a short visit . Brawith 's parents were dead and gone so long as to be nearly forgotten . They died long before the war . Moira was Brawith 's grandmother on his mother 's side . Moira had not known Brawith very well when he was a boy . And now she saw she hardly knew him once he had come to stay ; she had certainly not known to begin with he had no control over his bowels , and carried a roll of toilet paper wherever he went . <p> After he was back home with her awhile he seemed to get worse , but Moira would not hear of him going back to the hospital ward . <p> Most of the time Brawith sat quietly in a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stretch of woods visible from the back door . <p> Strangely enough he had a fair appetite and she spent most of her hours cooking . <p> If I have made a mistake , Moira began a letter to her sister Lily who lived ten miles away , I will not back down now . I will stand by my decision let whoever say what they may . For some reason she found she could not finish the letter . <p> Brawith liked to walk to the post office and mail her letters , and so she would write something to her other relatives on a government post card , and he would take it to the main post office , carrying the roll of toilet paper along with him . It was this habit of his more than what happened later on that drew attention to him . Moira did not have the heart to tell him not to take the roll of paper along , and besides she knew he needed it . <p> If he did all that for his country , why ca n't people look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote Lily . <p> Brawith , come in and rest . Take the weight off your poor feet , Moira said to him one hot August noon when he had been to the post office for her . You 're flushed from the walk in the sun ! She tried to take the roll of toilet paper away from him , but he held on tight and would not let her . <p> After that he always held on to it , whether at the dining table or sitting on the back porch watching the woods , or taking his walks to the post office . <p> Gradually it occurred even to her that he was slowly oozing from almost every pore in his body , and it was not that he did not think with words anymore , or not hear words , his attention was entirely occupied by the soft sounds like whispers arising from the wet parts of his insides , which shattered by wounds and hurts had begun gently coming out from within him or so it seemed , so that all his insides would one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would merge finally into one complete wet mass . <p> Moira began to understand this also , and she was never out of eyeshot of him except when he went on his walks . She did not ever relent then on having taken him from the Vets Hospital . She would not admit it was a mistake and agree to return him back there . No , he was her own , he was the only human being she felt who looked up to her , and she would keep him by her side therefore from this day forth . <p> Her reward , she always said , came when he would once or twice a week , no more , look up at her and say Moira . It meant thank you , she supposed , it meant even love she felt . His soft glossy brown hair and beard , thick almost as the pelt of an animal , was bathed in constant streams of sweat . She would touch his hair at such moments and her hand came away as wet as if she had wrung out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body had undergone but was , one might almost say , blossoming . His hair and his beard had not been cut in the new fashion of nowadays . <p> After a few evenings she came to the understanding that Brawith did not sleep . She slept very little herself , but she did fall off towards morning for two to three hours of slumber . The realization he did not sleep at all harmed her peace of mind more than any other fact . She did not regret nonetheless her action . She had this home , and the wide expanse of land around it , and she was his own flesh and blood and there was nothing she would not do for him . Besides she had never wanted him in the Vets Hospital in the first place , but her cousin Keith had arranged that . She had countermanded his action  --  hence Keith 's anger against her . <p> It had all begun the day when she was visiting Brawith in the hospital just as the sun was getting ready to go down . There was nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mopping the floor . She had taken Brawith 's hand in her own , and not letting go her hold , she had spoken as if begging on her knees , Brawith , do you choose Grandma 's own house or this place ? Tell me the truth . He had looked at her like a small child summoned in the middle of night by fire engines . He had despite his confusion tried to keep his mind on what it was she was saying , and at last after a long pause , he had said : Grandmother 's house , and nodded repeatedly . <p> Thereafter against all advice , instruction , and pleas , against the opinion of the doctors and nurses who had talked and even shouted at her , she had taken him away with her . One nurse had handed her the roll of toilet paper as she was going out the door with him . Moira had been too astonished not to receive it , and as if he sensed her dilemma , Brawith took the roll from her , holding it in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they went down the long flight of white clean-swept steps into Mr. Kwis 's truck and thence her property . <p> I knew of course I will be criticized , she finished the government post card to Lily the same day she brought Brawith home , but I feel as if I have had this call from the boy 's mother and father from on high . And I want to do something for the boy before I go . <p> She had no more written these last words than she saw Brawith was , as if by means of telepathy , waiting to take the post card to the post office . <p> Once in a blue moon Lily telephoned her from East Portage . During these phone calls Brawith was observed by his grandmother to sit down in the rocking chair , and letting the roll of toilet paper rest on his lap , he would rock and rock contentedly . She could see the damp emerging from his scalp and hair even from her position in the next room . <p> He has given his all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone to Lily , and as she said these words Brawith looked over at her and something almost like a smile passed over his blurred lips , for there was never any real expression on his face  --  all there was of expression must have been kept now in the depths of his insides which nudged and urged more and more to come out , to be released themselves like a sheet which would cover his outside skin and hair . <p> Her cousin Keith visited her from time to time on the side porch , and always insisted the same thing . In the name of decency at least , Keith would say , if not of proper care  --  which you can not give him  --  send him back to the Vets Hospital . <p> They were giving him nothing , Moira always contradicted Keith . <p> She frequently looked anxiously within the house when she and Keith talked on the side porch . She heard Brawith 's rocking chair going faster and faster . <p> He has the right to die with his loved ones , Moira told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a fury after these last words . <p> Coming back into the house , she took Brawith 's hand in hers , but he drew it away shortly to place it back on the roll of toilet paper . <p> His hands were only quiet , actually , when they rested on the roll of paper . The rolls were like a sleeping powder for him she thought . He appeared to sleep with them over his moving chest . <p> She kept a plentiful store of the rolls in her kitchen closet . They were of varying colors , but Brawith paid no attention to details of this kind . <p> Nothing is too good for you , Brawith , she sometimes would speak in a loud voice to him . And , she added in a softer voice , nothing is too good for my darling . <p> She felt he heard her , though she was beginning to understand at last that all he heard , all he felt , all he knew was the communications which the vast flowing wet of his insides imparted to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his arteries and veins , all of which whispered and told him of irreparable damage and disrepair , and of the awesome future that was to come . <p> Then one day when all was very still ( Moira was somewhat deaf in one ear ) , when no automobile having gone past for some time , as she was cleaning his feet in a basin , she became perfectly aware herself , despite her own moderate deafness , of the sounds inside himself . She paused for a moment , incredulous , fearful , yet at the same time with an anticipated relief that she could share his knowledge . She listened carefully and she heard enough of the many sounds that were coming from inside himself and which he listened to constantly . All this she was now aware of . Their eyes met briefly , and he gave her a kind of nod , meaning he knew she had heard the sounds and had understood . She held his feet in a tight clasp . That was the beginning of their even deeper closeness . <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sleepless together in the darkness , as they both listened to his body and waited for the day or perhaps the night to come when the fearful event would take place . <p> He now never spoke , and she occasionally hummed tunes and songs to him rather than say anything in ordinary speech except an occasional , That 's good , that 's very good . I want you to taste this mutton broth . <p> But the voices of his insides did something to her . She had known it all before , being mother , grandmother , but hearing it in a young man 's body , a young man who had not had a chance to live as yet , made her incapable to go about her work for a time . <p> Then gradually she resumed daily tasks , but nothing was the same . <p> Mr. Kwis , who had helped to bring Brawith home , now delivered the bread and other victuals for their meals , including a few fresh vegetables . He waited on the side porch always for Moira to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the food she prepared , but spit most of it out in a container provided near the table for this purpose . But his appetite was unimpaired . Whilst he ate , Moira and he listened casually to the sounds coming from inside his body . <p> After a time they ceased speaking to one another except when Moira issued commands for herself , as when she would say , I must wash out all your underthings this evening . And I must think up a new dish to tempt you , Brawith , for my knowledge of cooking 's gone from me . <p> Brawith would nod then and his nods were like a thousand smiles so far as she was concerned . <p> It is better here than where you were , Moira often inquired in what was almost a shouting tone . <p> His eyes studied her mouth , or rather her chin . She repeated her question . Almost as if to answer her , the sounds in his body became louder in response . <p> They walked out now into the garden , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and held them in his hands . He played with the seeds later that night when he tired of holding the toilet tissues . <p> As they lay near to one another at night , Moira began speaking aloud . She slept as little as Brawith did , that is , not at all . She said in a voice that was loud enough to carry into the yard by the window , Brawith , I have been criticized for everything . I am only sorry , though , I did n't come for you sooner . Do you hear . It was the only thing to do , my dear , the only thing .... <p> After a while his scalp and brow seemed to flow with a thick beady moisture . She often thought she spent most of the time wiping his brow free of the ever-gathering damp . It reminded her of driving in cars long ago before there were windshield wipers , and the snow , rain , or sleet fell remorselessly against the car 's panes of glass . They would have to stop the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I ca n't tell you what it means to me , Moira spoke as she wiped his brow often in the middle of night . Having you here with me , I was doing nothing before you came , she went on . Cousin Keith and my own daughter can hardly wait to leave now the minute they arrive here . I 've told them all I know . They 've heard my same old tale till they gag if I begin even to say what kind of weather we 've been having . They 've had all of me , but Brawith , you allow me to give you of the little I have for anybody . <p> Having spoken she would then wipe his brow until it was almost dry but then another sheet of the moisture came down and he was as damp as before . <p> My dear grandson , Brawith , she whispered too low for him to hear . <p> After a long pause she went on : <p> Mr. Kwis is more interested in what I say than my daughter or son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brow became more and more sopping wet the voices inside his body grew more insistent , more authoritative . She felt they were crying out for something withheld from him , and now Brawith no longer swallowed what he chewed and tasted , but spat the whole thing out . <p> Moira and he sat listening to the dictatorial sounds issuing from inside him . Grandmother and grandson were pushed into a deeper silence as if they sat before a political orator or a preacher of the gospel . <p> One morning , coming out of a short nap-like sleep , she heard some new sounds arising from the fireplace . She called his name , but she realized now he could barely hear her because the sounds from his own swimming insides drowned out all other sound . <p> Walking into the next room she found he had put his head up into the chimney of the huge fireplace . The fireplace was so high she could see his mouth and part of his nose for he was not standing up very straight . <p> Brawith , what is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes . Are you more comfortable there , my bear boy . <p> After a long while he come out from the chimney . He looked happier , and this pleased Moira . They went out into the kitchen together and she prepared him his breakfast . <p> She realized her danger then at last , that is , that she had perhaps made a mistake in disobeying the trained nurses and the doctors , in ignoring the advice of her kinfolk . She remembered too even in her good friend Mr. Kwis 's face the look sometimes of wonderment if not disapproval . <p> At the same time she could not go back on her decision in the first place . She felt even more strongly she could not give up Brawith . She studied her own heart , and she knew she had never loved anybody with such complete absorption as she did Brawith . She felt her own insides cried out along with his . Yet she made up her mind to ask him one last time . <p> Whilst she was mopping his forehead , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good now , Brawith , for Moira wants to do the right thing . Do you think maybe you should go back to the Vets . Say the word and I will do what 's right . <p> He did not say anything in reply , and in the silence she began combing his hair , which was sopping wet . <p> Just say the word , Brawith , and I will do as you see fit . <p> As he did not say anything , she sighed , for she knew his silence naturally meant he would not wish to return . <p> You did n't think that I was indirectly asking you to leave now , did you , she turned to him . Heaven forbid you thinking that , Brawith . You 're more welcome than sunshine . You 've brought so much to me , precious . <p> After that she knew she would never need ask him about returning . <p> He would have certainly said something had he thought it was best for his condition to go back to the Vets . <p> Now for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chimney of the fireplace , so that after a while she brought her cot there in the center of the big living room to be as near as possible to him . It was beginning to be more unbearable than ever for her , but she could no more have forbidden him standing in the fireplace than order him back to the hospital . <p> The odor from his sickness , however , now discouraged anybody from visiting them . Mr. Kwis himself came only as far as the side door and having brought them the groceries he deposited them on a small table and departed . Cousin Keith no longer came at all . <p> Moira often whispered with Mr. Kwis in the buttery . <p> He gave his all , Mr. Kwis , and it 's very little I can give him in return for all he has sacrificed , yes , sirree . <p> She felt now that he had come to her of his own free will , that she had not prevailed on him to join her here at the outskirts of Flempton , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her home . She had never known such happiness , such calm , such useful tasks . Mr. Kwis , though he did not come so far into the house to see Brawith , was the soul of understanding . He listened . He understood unlike Cousin Keith or her son and daughter . Mr. Kwis offered no word of contradiction , no bilious corrective or cold comment . <p> Brawith now refused to come out of the place he had chosen for himself in the chimney . He spent the entire day and night there . Moira saw that a terrible crisis was coming , yet she did not want to call the doctor or inform the Veterans Hospital . Brawith had promised her he would stay until the last . <p> Mr. Kwis came when the terrible thing was at its height . Owing to the stench he said he would remain as his custom was on the side porch , and if she thought it advisable he would go for help . <p> Brawith now began to scratch and claw the brick , but instead of dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sweat was descending as if from a broken pipe , and this was followed by actual sheets of blood . <p> Moira begged him to come out of the chimney and lie down on his bed , but the sounds of his body all at once tripled in volume . Even Mr. Kwis heard them from outside . <p> Occasionally Moira would cry out his name , but the sound of his inside machinery , as she thought of it , drowned out her words . <p> At last he foamed at the mouth , and the foam fell down in thick cusps like what comes off cheap beer in the summer . <p> She felt she must hold him up into the body of the chimney since this was his wish . <p> Mr. Kwis kept calling from the side porch if there was anything at all which he might do , but she either did not hear him , or the few times she did hear him she was too distracted to reply . <p> The climax was coming or whatever it was , the end she supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here she was his only flesh and blood relation to help at this dire moment . No nurse or doctor could do what she was doing , and this thought strengthened and appeased her . <p> Tell me , dear boy , if I should do anything different from what I am doing , Moira would cry out , but the sounds from his insides extinguished her voice . <p> All at once he lowered his head from inside the chimney and pointed with a kind of queer majesty with one hand towards a roll of toilet paper . <p> She unwound some of the roll and put it within reach of him . Then she saw that without her being aware of it he was naked , but looking again she decided that he still had his clothes on but they had become of the same color and wetness as his skin which breaking totally now exposed his insides . The clothes only resembled his broken skin and bleeding organs . He was not so much hemorrhaging as bursting from inside . <p> He managed to put the sheets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his body . <p> He soon used up the one roll of toilet paper , and Moira now called for Mr. Kwis to go into the buttery where she had put all the remaining rolls , and to toss her one from time to time for Brawith was quickly using them all up . <p> You wo n't have to come much closer to us than you are now , she advised Mr. Kwis . The crisis , dear friend , is near . <p> It seemed that Brawith exhausted one entire toilet paper roll almost immediately it was given him . There were only four left . As he draped his body with the tissues they immediately became red from the wet stuff that was now breaking from within his entire body . <p> When the last roll was consumed , Moira wondered what would happen . <p> Then she thought she heard him scream , but she realized that the many noises and sounds which had been audible within his body were moving up now to his larynx and causing his vocal chords to vibrate as if he were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word or part of an unfinished phrase : Deliver ! repeated again and again : Deliver . <p> Then like a flock of birds the terrible noise seemed to rush over her head , deafening her . She fell , losing her hold on his legs , and as she did so an immense shower of blood descended like some monstrous curtain . <p> Moira did not know how she was able to rise and finally make her toilsome way to the side porch where Mr. Kwis was waiting with anxious dread . She hardly needed to tell him her grandson was no more . In silence , Mr. Kwis took her hands in his and pressed them to his lips . Then speaking in a faint whisper , he said he would go now to tell all who were concerned that the heavy burden of Brawith 's life had been lifted at last . <p>
