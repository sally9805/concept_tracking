" He thinks he 's a shit on a stick but he 's really just a fart on a splinter , " Carlie said . It was a cotton mill saying she had been repeating for years . She especially liked to say it about T.J. <p> T.J. was walking back down the hill to his pickup . He had brought her another case of Budweiser , a bottle of pills , and a carton of Winstons . <p> " He 's hoping I will drink myself to death , and then he wo n't never have to pay me , " Carlie said as she tore open the carton . <p> " Why n't you get the law after him in the first place ? " I said . <p> Carlie lit a cigarette and pulled a can out of the box of beer . <p> " Give me one of them , " I said . <p> " Get your own beer , you lazy pup . " <p> I helped myself to a can and popped the top . The beer tasted a little bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a humid day . It was a taste I craved when we did n't have no money . <p> " Why n't you get the law after T.J. in the first place ? " I said again . This was a conversation we had at least once a week . I knew all the answers already , but we could n't resist going through the motions , especially when we had beer . When Carlie was on her pills she liked to listen to rock-'n ' - roll on the radio and laugh and sometimes dance . She danced by herself in the dark room with a cigarette in her mouth . She circled round and inhaled and laughed . And she did n't want the light on . She did n't want to see the mess on the floor and on all the chairs . She just wanted to turn in circles and smoke and think about when she was a girl working in the cotton mill and had a boyfriend named Grover . That was way before she met Daddy and moved up here to the farm . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teenage Canteen , " she 'd say . " That was just before he went overseas . " Sometimes she 'd say Grover was killed in the war and never did come back , and sometimes she 'd say he returned and married somebody else . It was hard to know what the truth was in her stories because she made up so much . In fact , I do n't think there ever was a Grover . I think that was just a fig leaf of her imagination . <p> But when Carlie drank beer she liked most to talk about how terrible T.J. had done us , and was still doing her . <p> " Why 'd you agree to sell him the place in the first place ? " I said . <p> " Cause your Daddy , bless his poor little dried-up soul in hell , borrowed five thousand dollars from T.J. , and I could n't afford to pay it back . " <p> I noticed a speck of dirt on top of my can . " I wonder where T.J. gets such dirty cans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army , " Carlie said and laughed . She laughed so hard she bent over in her chair and the ash from her cigarette fell on the floor . <p> " The world is my ashtray , " she said in falsetto . <p> " This floor ought to be swept , " I said . <p> " You 're a big strong feller , sweep it yourself , " Carlie said , " ' stead of sitting around on your fat ass drinking my beer . " <p> " T.J. ' s beer . " <p> " It 's payment on what he still owes me . " <p> I wiped the top of the can with my sleeve . For some reason I like the top of a can to be dry when I 'm drinking from it . " Why 'd Daddy owe him five thousand dollars ? " I said . <p> " Cause your Daddy did n't have a mite of sense , and he had cancer and could n't work . The truth was he never did work much . And I was too sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mill . " <p> " So he just borrowed ? " <p> " He borrowed against the place . He was going to inherit this big place . Everybody said Riley 's place was the finest place on the creek . " <p> " Give me a cigarette , " I said . <p> She pulled the carton out of my reach . " Get your own cigarettes , " she said . <p> " Besides , smoking is bad for you . " <p> " And it 's not bad for you ? " <p> " Do n't do as I do , do as I say do . " She laughed , but the laugh turned into a cough . I took a cigarette from the pack and lit it . <p> " Next time T.J. comes tell him you 'll sue him , " I said . <p> " And he 'll say we got to move out . " <p> " We can move out if he 'll pay us the rest of the mortgage . " <p> T.J. had built a trailer park on the pasture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ridge . The ridge was called Riley 's Knob after my grandpa who kept it clear and grazed cattle on the very top . <p> " How much does he still owe us ? " I said . <p> " He claims he do n't owe us nothing , that we done used it all up in rent for this old house and in the beer and little bits of groceries he brings . " <p> " People say he paid you years ago and you drunk it all up . " <p> " That 's a damn lie . " <p> " He tells people , " Carlie said and opened another can . " Ai n't it about lunchtime ? " I said . <p> " No , it 's almost time for Tucson Days . " That was a soap opera that comes on in the middle of the day which she had been watching for several months . It was all about people in a retirement community and their families and people who work at the center . There was always somebody dying of cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second younger family in Phoenix . And then there was somebody with AIDS , and somebody impotent , and a young nurse who was trying to marry an old guy for his money , except the young nurse is really a lesbian . " Maybe I 'll get my gun and go talk to T.J. , " I said . <p> " You ai n't gon ' talk to nobody , " Carlie said . " You want to talk to somebody , go talk to somebody about a job . " It was a point that always came up in our conversations  --  that I had lost my job . And she knew as well as I did it was impossible to get another one . When ! worked in the cotton mill they put me to lifting boxes in the stockroom , and ! hurt my side . Their crooked doctor would n't give me disability and when I stayed out a few days for my side to heal they fired me . Because they fired me no other company would give me a job . All these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the TV on and sat about a yard away from the screen . She kept her lighter in her right hand and a can in the left . <p> " Ai n't you going to fix no lunch ? " I said . " Get out of here , " she said below her breath . <p> You always feel stuffy when you 've been drinking in the daytime and go out into the sun . It 's like the light presses against you and pushes you around . And you do n't feel like doing anything either . Even while the beer makes you feel lighter , it pulls you down inside . That 's why Carlie likes her pills in the morning and sometimes even when she 's drinking . <p> I 'd grabbed a pack of cigarettes on my way out of the dark house and I lit one , bending over to get out of the bright light and the breeze . <p> The smoke tasted good . It was the only thing interesting out there in the yard . <p> The pickup still sat where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get that damn truck fixed so we can go to town , " Carlie had said . The bearings were gone in the left front wheel , but I could n't afford another set . I could squirt some grease in and drive it to the store if I had to , but the front end shimmied like sixty , and I was afraid it would ruin something else . I had to wait till I got some money from T.J. or from working for the rich people down on the lake . They 'd come after me sometimes to help fix a railing on a deck or to dig out a ditch along their driveway . But my back had been killing me again , ever since I wrenched it crawling under the truck to get the bearings out . <p> " I 'll let you have my old pickup , " T.J. had said . But he 'd just use it as another excuse not to pay us the rest of the mortgage . You do n't get nothing from T.J. for nothing . <p> There was n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if a letter had come from the unemployment office . I applied for compensation , but they said I could n't draw anything unless I could prove I was laid off in good standing . They said I 'd have to contest the mill 's claim I was fired . I filled out another form for them . I said I was as hard a worker as the next man , except when my back was acting up . It was their crooked doctor that would n't give me disability . <p> So they said they would have a hearing about it , and I 've been waiting ever since and not drawed a cent from the government . <p> Used to be Grandpa kept the yard mowed clean in front of the house . But after the lawnmower broke down and would n't start I could n't keep up with all the weeds . And then Carlie throwed out her old washing machine in the side yard , and the rusty barbeque grill and about five hundred cans , and it was such a mess you could n't hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a snake . And the weeds had already grown up around the truck like it had been parked there all summer . <p> When I was a kid Grandpa kept the driveway neat as a golf course . But T.J. had covered up the old drive and made a road to his trailer park . He was always bringing in trucks and building more spaces for trailers . I could hear a bullnoser somewhere up there grading , way on back of the Knob . <p> I took T.J. 's road across the little creek and up the hill to the mailbox . Grandpa had a little bridge there , and it was the perfect place for a kid to play , where the mowed grass came right down to the water and you could watch minnows shoot around the pools . I waded there and made little dams and fished with a stalk of grass . I could slip through the edge of the pasture when the bull was penned up . Grandpa would take me over to the orchard on the bank below the road and peel an apple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It looked like a little park in there , the way he kept the place , the gate and apple trees , the little bridge over the branch , the boxwoods along the driveway . Carlie sold all the boxwoods right after Daddy died to help pay for the funeral , she said . If she had known what T.J. was going to do she would have sold off everything else , too . <p> One time I went by the barn and pulled all the railings out of the gap . I liked to slide the poles back and forth in their slots and drop the ends on the ground . But they were too heavy for me to lift back into their holders , and I left them down when I saw the mailman stop , and I ran to the mailbox . <p> When the bull got back to that end of the pasture he walked out , just stepped right through the bars . And he was a mean bull , too . Everybody was afraid of him . Grandpa kept him to breed people 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three dollars a time . People were always driving their heifers down when they were spreeing and bawling along the road . And the bull would hear them and bawl back and then come running from whatever part of the pasture he was in . People usually brought their cows down late in the day , after they had stopped work in the fields and when they knew Grandpa would be around the barn , milking or watering the stock . <p> But when the bull got out it took half the people in the valley half the night to find him . I knew I 'd done something bad , but Grandpa said nothing . He lit his old barn lantern and went out looking . Carlie smacked me across the mouth with the flat of her hand so my lip cracked . <p> " You 'll get somebody killed with that bull , and we 'll all go to jail , " she said . <p> I followed Grandpa and did n't go back to the house . The men hollered and ran along the fence at Fairfield 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with the cows . Grandpa could n't hear too well , and the men talked about him like he was n't there . <p> " Riley 's too old to keep a bull , " they said . <p> " And Riley 's boy has fouled his nest , " they said . <p> " Now he 's got cotton mill trash in on him , " another said . <p> " Got to keep your breeding stock up ; otherwise a family will run to ruin in two generations . " <p> Grandpa walked along with his lantern , not saying a thing . They followed the bull , along the fence up into the hollow and cornered him among the poplars . Grandpa snapped a chain to the ring in his nose , and they put a halter over his head . <p> " You want us to lead him backs ? " they said . <p> " Much obliged , " Grandpa said . " I can handle him . " <p> I walked in front of Grandpa , carrying the lantern . <p> Where the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , T.J. had bullnosed a new road for : the trailer park and put in a culvert over the branch . It was all raw dirt . Grass would n't seem to grow on anything T.J. made . <p> " This place is all clay , " he said . " I do n't see how Riley ever growed a weed on it . " <p> But T.J. knew how to grow trailer sites . They were all over the old pasture , all over Riley 's Knob to the very top . ' There was n't no mail except a circular and three bills . I threw circular in the ditch and stuffed the bills in my pocket . Carlie wo n't hardly ever pay bills : until they cut the electricity off , and then she has ask T.J. for the honey . Of course , if T.J. owns ' the house like he says says he does , the bills should come to him . <p> I saw I was going to have to have it out with T.J : I could n't could n't on what Carlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretch anything to suit her ; depending on who she was talking to . <p> I tried to remember if T.J. 's truck had gone up the hill after he left the beer , or if he had turned back toward the road . ' If he was up ' on the Knob I could catch . him and have some things out . But I could n't recall I had been too busy arguing with Carlie about the beer to notice where <p> You could hear the bullnoser up there , working somewhere the Knob . And there was always trucks going up there , pulling new trailers and carrying loads of this and that . You would have thought he was building a shopping mall up there for all the stuff they hauled up ; the mountain . <p> I had n't been up On the Knob in years . It was a steep climb , and T.J. had cut down all the trees so there was no place to squirrel hunt . Anti they were always working up there . You could hear the bullnoser going almost every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the shower of gravel being dumped on the road . <p> I 'd just go up there and have a little talk with T.J. There was n't anything else to do , except go back and watch TV with Carlie . The beer was wearing of and I was starting to sweat . <p> The old house sat on the only spot of ground that had n't been bull-nosed by T.J. Where the barn and shed stood he had covered up the old boards with dirt and filled in over the culvert . The whole hill behind the barn had been skinned off , with rocks and dirt showing . Where T.J. sowed grass around the trailers it mostly did n't take , and the little bits of shrubbery died . But them people living up there did n't care . They came and went , some working at the cotton mill and some with construction crews . Several trailers had Mexicans in them . They worked in the shrubbery business as diggers and weed cutters . But you almost never saw them . They left before daylight and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One time I heard they bought a goat and roasted it for a celebration . But I do n't think it was anything voodoo . They just like goat . <p> My feet kept slipping on the gravel of T.J. 's drive , and I was out of breath before I got halfway up the hill . Too many smokes , I thought , and too much beer . Most of the trailers I passed were deserted . Sometimes you could hear the sound of a TV or the buzz of an air conditioner . Pretty little wives sitting around in shorts watching television , I thought . That 's what you could have if you worked : a pretty little wife in shorts , sitting cool at home when you get off from work . The oil tanks on their stands stood like steel cows behind every trailer , and off on the side of each one a satellite dish tilted like a big white flower . I glanced through a window or two , but I could n't see anybody inside . <p> Up ahead a little kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low tricycle that was meant to look like a motorcycle . The plastic wheels crunched hollow on the gravel . <p> " Ruddunn , ruddunn , " the kid said , revving his engine . The kid was making so much noise with his throat and with the sound of the wheels on gravel , he could n't hear a truck coming round the switchback above . It was one of those trucks with sideboards , the kind they use to deliver building supplies . The kid kept peddling out into the road , and the truck did n't slow down but seemed to be gaining speed . <p> " Hey , " I hollered , and tried to run up the hill . I tried to flag the truck driver , but he just kept coming , like he did n't see the tricycle . The kid was peddling right out into the middle of the road , and at the last second the truck swerved and missed him and then passed me in a cloud of dust . I did n't even get a look at the driver . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Division , " but I did n't have a chance to read it . <p> " Does your Mama know where you are ? " I said to the kid . He did n't seem worried by what had almost happened . I felt like I had been electrocuted and needed to stand still . The dirty little kid had nothing on but a pair of shorts . <p> " I 'll race you down there , " he said , and pointed down the road . <p> " You better get back in your yard , " I said . There was no woman in sight around the trailer , and no car neither . <p> " Better get out of the road , " I said . <p> " You ai n't my daddy , " the little boy said , and peddled on down hill . It was n't clear which trailer he belonged to . <p> Grandpa used to take me for sled rides on the pasture hill . He 'd hitch up the stone boat to get wood around the Knob and let me stand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill . <p> " Why do n't you use the wagon ? " I said to him . <p> " Because it 's too steep here , " he said . " A wagon would tip over or run away . " <p> From the Knob you could see all the way down to the river valley and the lake and cotton mill town . Today all I could see was the super-highway they cut through above the cotton mill . The traffic on it was a steady roar . It was too hazy to see much farther . <p> I heard the bullnoser going around the back of the Knob and thought , that 's where T.J. must be working . He must be clearing more woods and cutting out more places for trailers . I 'd just go over there and see what he was doing . <p> The Knob used to be a grassy top , where you could sit and look all over the valley . But it had grown up in bushes and briars , right at the summit . The new road T.J. had cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Grandpa 's land and the Casey ridge . What could T.J. be doing back there ? It was n't even part of the place . <p> Whatever it was , they had been busy , for the road was packed down and dusty . A few ragweeds drooped in the middle , but they did n't have much of a chance against the traffic and dust . Dead roots stuck out of the bank of the road . <p> The new road went farther into the holier , into the trees . I could hear the bullnoser rev up and then quiet down , screech into reverse , lurching and grinding like a tank . That seemed strange . Why would T.J. be making another trailer place farther in the woods when he still had space in the pasture ? <p> You could smell the diesel exhaust in the holler . Kudzu had climbed up the oak trees right to the top and then hung over . I do n't know how the kudzu got started because it was n't there in Grandpa 's time . The Caseys brought their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe they had brought a sprig of kudzu or a seed of the stuff with their trash . <p> T.J. 's pickup was parked right in the road , and then there was another big truck beyond it . Republic Industries : Carrier Division was painted on the big truck . It was the kind of truck that had an elevator at the rear , but the bed was empty . <p> T.J. stood at the edge of the clearing watching the bullnoser work . The whole place had the smell of opened dirt , which always reminds me of mothballs and camphor , and the smoke of hammered rock . There must be some kind of fumes that come up out of the ground . Far above the clearing the kudzu hung from the oak trees in a mournful way . <p> I could n't tell what the bullnoser was doing , except there was oil drums and big paint cans on the ground where they had rolled them off the truck . <p> You should have seen the look on T.J. 's face when he saw me . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . <p> " You ai n't got no business up here , " he said . " This is notrespassing land . " <p> " It ai n't even your land , yet , " I said , sounding madder than I felt because of the heat and being out of breath . <p> " Do n't start that again , " he said . " This was n't never your Grandpa 's land . This was Gasey land , and ! bought it from them . " <p> " Just like you bought Grandpa 's ? " I said . <p> " Let 's go talk in the truck , " he said . " It 's air-conditioned . " <p> He practically pushed me toward the truck . <p> " It 's time to settle this , " I said , feeling bolder than I ever had before . " Let 's get out of the heat , " he said . <p> T.J. 's pickup was practically new , but the cab was already dusty and piled with bills and invoices , candy wrappers , old coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I 'm going to put that up for Jerry , " he said , pushing the goal to the floor . " When I get time . Just push everything out of the way . " <p> When he started the motor and turned on the air-conditioning it was hotter at first , and then the breeze got cold . The sweat made me shiver , and I could see he was hoping to dampen the anger I 'd worked up . It 's harder to be mad sitting beside somebody than standing up and facing them . I expected him to start in telling me how Carlie had already drunk up half the price of the place , and smoked and borrowed the rest , like he always did . But he did n't . <p> " Are you hurting for money ? " he said . " I knowed you got laid off . " <p> " I 'm always hurting for money , " I said . <p> " I could let you have some , " he said . <p> " T.J. , it ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a big place . " <p> " It 's just a rocky mountainside . " <p> " Not when Grandpa had it . " <p> " Your Grandpa killed hisself to make something out of this brush and hardpan . " <p> " You 're going to have to pay ups " I said . " Or you 'll what ? " <p> " Or I 'll go to law . " <p> " If you need a few dollars I can let you have it . " <p> From the cold inside of the truck I could just barely see the bullnoser . But for the first time it occurred to me what the bullnoser was doing . Those oil drums were n't full of fuel . He was covering them up . He was burying the paint cans and barrels . <p> " What you putting in the ground there , T.J. ? " I said . <p> " Just some trash from the Republic plant . " He offered me a cigarette , then put the truck in gear and started backing away . " We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Or better still , we could go down to the highway and get some dinner . How 'd you like a hotdog and a Pepsi ? " <p> Nothing T.J. said was what I expected him to say . He did n't get mad and cuss like he usually did . He face was red , but he did n't seem mad . He had n't even claimed the place was paid for a long time ago . <p> We bounced down the ruts and washes of the road , and the truck whined on the switchbacks as he geared it down . He had a real good air conditioner . It was a funny feeling , looking down on the valley through summer haze from Grandpa 's Knob , from a box of chilly air , and Winding among the trailers and scraggly bits of shrubbery T.J. had set out . <p> And then it struck me what the bullnoser was covering up back there , and why T.J. was being so friendly . <p> " You 're burying poisons and chemicals up there , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was illegal to put chemicals in the ground . You could be sent to jail for poisoning the water system . " What you mean ? " T.J. said . " I give them permission to put trash from the factory there . " <p> " Them barrels are full of poison , " I said . " Now I see . " <p> " You do n't see nothing , " T.J. said , all his friendliness gone . <p> " You could be sued . " <p> T.J. was driving faster , banging on the washouts . <p> " You cotton mill trash will have to get off my land , " he said . " Tell Carlie she 's got to move . " <p> " We ai n't moving , " I said . " Not after I tell the law what you 're putting up there . " <p> T.J. kept going faster on the switchbacks , sliding on gravel and throwing rocks every which way . I was glad to see the kid on the plastic bike was off the road and waving from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law a thing and you 're out in the road with your old TV and stinking couch , " he said . " And they 'll lock Carlie up in the asylum for crazy people and drug addicts . " <p> " And they 'll lock you up for poisoning the ground , " I said . " Then the place will come back to us . " <p> " Get out , " he hollered , and slid to a stop in front of the house . <p> " You 're in trouble , " I said and slammed the door . He spun off , throwing rocks fifty or sixty feet . The heat felt good after the cold cab . <p> The screen door scraped on the back porch when I opened it . The bottom of the screen had scratched a curve on the floorboards . I 'd meant to fix it for months , but a door is harder to repair than it looks . We 'd probably have to replace the whole thing one of these days , because if you unscrew the hinges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rub in other places , and the latch wo n't click , or one of the corners wo n't fit into the frame . It has to be a complete job or nothing . <p> Carlie had tied a piece of cloth over the hole in the screen to keep the flies out . It looked like something put there for a charm to keep the bad spirits away . <p> " Where the hell you been ? " she said . <p> " I 've been around , " I said , and pulled the bills out of my back pocket to hand to her . She 'd had two or three more beers since I 'd left , and maybe another pill from the jar . <p> It was so dark in the house I could only see her face reflected in the TV light . The air was filled with smoke . She was so wrecked she could n't tear open the envelopes and gave it up and threw them on the table . <p> " You 'll have to pay them , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You got years left in you , " I said . <p> " Trifling lard ass , " she said , and tossed her head , as she does when drunk , like she was a debutante on TV . <p> " I seen T.J. , " I said . I would n't tell her about the chemical dump for a while . It was my little secret . <p> " You get any money from him ? " <p> " I told him he 'd have to pay up . " <p> " You lazy-assed chicken , " she said . " I 'd rather eat shit with a splinter than beg for money . " That was another of the cotton mill sayings she liked to bring out when she was drunk . She lit another cigarette , not touching the flame to the tip until the third try . <p> I decided I would n't tell her at all . The oil drums buried across the Knob would be a secret between T.J. and me . He would keep me in beer and cigs and maybe get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us out , and I did n't need to tell Carlie a thing about it . <p> " Give me one of them beers , " I said . <p> " Get your own beer . " <p> There was a game show on the TV with a laugh track . I hated game shows as much as Carlie loved them . I popped a beer and headed back outside . I had n't felt so good since I found a twenty-dollar bill in the parking lot of the plant before I was laid off . I sat on the porch looking down at the driveway T.J. had put in where the barn was . The cold beer tasted like hope and confidence . I 'd have the pickup running again by next week . <p> When Grandpa was old and could n't really work anymore he piddled around the barn , mowing a few weeds , watering the horse , sharpening his hoes , and talking to hisself . When I was home on leave from the army he took me down to the shed adjoining the barn where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacks piled on it , and he showed me one by one where he hid his mowing blade and pliers , his hammer and wire cutters , whetrock and file . He said people stole so bad nowadays you had to keep things hid . He wanted me to know where they were in case he died . The tater digger and ax leaned behind some boards in the corner . The good harness for the horse was behind the table with some sacks piled on it . <p> <p> By ROBERT MORGAN <p>
