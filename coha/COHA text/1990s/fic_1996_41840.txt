Later the squat white cylinders with their delicate indentations would be revealed as a species of lantern . But when Krzysztof Wojciechowicz first glimpsed them , dotted among the azaleas and rhododendrons and magnolias surrounding Constance Humboldt 's kidney-shaped swimming pool , he saw them as dolls . The indentations cut the frosted tubes like waists , a third of the way down ; the swellings above and below reminded him of bodices and rounded skirts . Perhaps he viewed the lanterns this way because the girls guiding him down the flagstone steps and across the patio were themselves so doll-like . Amazingly young , amazingly smoothskinned . They were sisters , they 'd said . The tiny dark-haired one who 'd appeared in the hotel lobby was Rose ; the round-cheeked one driving the battered van , with her blond hair frizzing in all directions , was Bianca . Already he 'd been clumsy with them . <p> " You are . . . are you Dr. Humboldt 's daughters ? " he 'd asked . The sun was so bright , his eyes were so tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The step up to the van 's back seat was too high for him , but neither girl noticed him struggling . <p> The small one , Rose , had laughed at his question . " We 're not related to Constance , " she 'd said . " I 'm a postdoctoral fellow at the institute . " The blond one , who called to mind his own mother sixty years earlier , pulled out of the hotel driveway too fast and said nothing during the short drive to the Humboldts ' house . He feared he 'd hurt her feelings . For the last decade or so , he 'd been subject to these embarrassing misidentifications , taking young scientists for children or servants when he met them out of context . They all dressed so casually , especially in this country ; their faces were so unmarked-how could anyone tell them from the young people who chauffeured him about or offered trays of canapes at parties ? But of course he should have known these girls , he 'd probably met them earlier . And now , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the long table spread with food and drink , the girl called after a flower veered toward a crowd gathered by the pool and left him with the girl he 'd affronted . <p> " Dr. Wojciechowicz ? " she said , mangling his name as she steered him closer to the table . " Would you like a drink , or something ? " <p> Reflexively he corrected her pronunciation ; then he shook his head and said , " Please . Call me Krzysztof . And you are Bianca , yes ? " He could not help noticing that she had lovely breasts . <p> " That 's me , " she agreed dryly . " Bianca the chauffeur ; Bianca , Rose 's sister ; not related to the famous Dr. Constance Humboldt . No one you need to pay attention to at all . " <p> " It 's not ... , " he said . Of course he had insulted her . " It 's just that I 'm so tired , and I 'm still jet-lagged , and . . " <p> Could he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somewhere north of Philadelphia , he thought ; but he knew this generally , not specifically . When he 'd arrived two days ago , his body still on London time , he had fallen asleep during the long , noisy drive from the airport . Since then he 'd had no clear sense of his location . He woke in a room that looked like any other ; each morning a different stranger appeared and drove him to the institute . Other strangers shuttled him from laboratory to laboratory , talking at length about their research projects ; then from laboratory to cafeteria to auditorium to laboratory ; from lobby to restaurant and back to his hotel . He had given a talk , but it was the same talk he 'd been giving for years . He had met perhaps thirty fellow scientists and could remember only a handful of their names . All of them seemed to be gathered here , baring too much skin to the early July sun . It was Saturday , he thought . Also some holiday seemed to be looming . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foibles of the elderly . " " How old are you ? " <p> Her smile was charming , and he forgave her rude question . " I am seventy-nine years of age , " he said . " Easy to remember-I was born in i9oo , I am always as old as the century . " <p> " Foibles forgiven . " She-Bianca , he thought , Bianca-held out her hand in that strange boyish way of American women . Meanwhile she was looking over his shoulders , as if hoping to find someone to rescue her . " Bianca Marburg , not quite twenty-two , but I 'm very old for my age . " <p> " You would be in college , then ? " <p> She tossed her hair impatiently . " Not hardly . My sister and I were dreadful little prodigies-in college at sixteen , out at nineteen , right into graduate school . Rose already has her Ph.D.how else do you think she 'd have a postdoc here ? " <p> Would he never say the right thing to this bristly girl ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the project you are working on ? " Americans , he 'd been reminded these last two days , were always eager to talk about themselves . <p> " So , then , I-I should be in graduate school , and I was until two months ago , but I just dropped out , it was seeming stupid to me . Unlike my so-successful sister , Rose , I am at loose ends . " <p> She moved a bowl of salad closer to a platter of sliced bread draped with a doth , then moved it back again . " Which is why I 'm driving you around . Why I 'm here . I 'm sort of between places , you know ? Between lives ? I got a temp job typing for this Iraqi biophysicist here-see that short guy over by the volleyball net ? He hired me because I can spell ' vacuum ' and he ca n't spell anything in English . Eight weeks , typing some grant applications . I 'm staying with my sister until I get enough money together to move . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice , " Krzysztof said helplessly . <p> " Oh , please , " she said . " You do n't have to pretend to be interested . I 'm low on the conversational totem pole here , and you 're this big famous scientist , and I know you 've got better things to do than talk to me . Go talk to the other famous people . Constance collects them , they 're everywhere . " <p> She huffed off-furious , he saw . At him ? In the battered leather bag that hung from his shoulder , he felt the bottle he 'd carried across the ocean as a special gift for his hostess . But his hostess was nowhere to be seen , and no one moved toward him from the pool or the round tables with their mushroom-like umbrellas . Already the top of his head was burning ; and he was all alone and wished he had a hat . Was it possible these people meant to stay in the sun all afternoon ? <p> Bianca made a brisk circuit through the backyard , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaning attentively toward Constance 's husband , Roger , and listening to him talk about Norway as if she were actually interested . Entirely typical , Bianca thought ; Rose submitted herself to Roger 's boring monologues as a way of pleasing Constance , who was her advisor . But Rose had forbidden Bianca to go anywhere near Roger , since he 'd overheard her in the cafeteria comparing his droopy , fleshy face to that of a camel . Constance herself was holding court from an elegant lawn chair beneath an umbrella , surrounded by graduate students and postdocs and talking about the session she 'd chaired at a Gordon Conference two weeks earlier-but Bianca could not bear the way Constance patronized her , and she steered wide of this group . Almost she joined the two girls Constance employed from the small women 's college down the road , who were trotting up and down the steps bearing pitchers of iced tea and lemonade ; she would have felt at home with them , but Constance had rebuked her , at last week 's reception , for distracting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ net beckoned , Rick and Wen-li and Diego stripped of their shirts and gleaming in the sun , but she had slept with Diego after that reception , and things were still awkward between them . Vivek and Anisha , easing themselves into the shallow end of the pool just as Jocelyn , already cannonball-shaped , curled her arms around her legs and launched herself into the deep end with a splash ? No , no , no . Vivek was charming , but Jocelyn was impossible , and she was already whaling down on her young squire . Everywhere Bianca looked there was laughter , chatter , the display of flesh-much of it , Bianca thought , better left hidden-flirtation and bragging and boredom . A standard holiday weekend party , except that all of these people were scientists and many of them were famous ; and she was neither . And had , as Rose reminded her constantly , no one to blame for this but herself <p> Off by the fragrant mock-orange tree , she spotted the institute 's two resident Nobel laureates side by side , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trolls . She drifted their way , curious to see if they were dashing yet . Arnold puffed and plucked at his waistband ; Herb snorted and rolled his eyes . But the serious drinking had not yet begun , and these were only false charges , still made in fun . Last week she had sat next to Arnold during Winifred 's seminar on the isozymes of alpha-amylase , and watched him and Herb shred Winifred in their boastful cross-fire . Arnold had smiled at her . <p> " Nice to see you gentlemen again , " Bianca said , when she reached their circle of shade . The men stared at her blankly . On the smooth green grass , Arnold 's left foot tapped . <p> " Bianca Marburg , " she reminded them . He had smiled at her , had n't he ? When she asked that question about the electrophoretic bands ? <p> " You're-in Jocelyn 's lab ? " Arnold said now . " Rose sister , " she said , grinning stupidly . Herb frowned , still unable to place her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . . . were you typing ? For Fu'ad ? " <p> She held her hands up like claws and typed the air . " C'est moi " she said . What was she doing here ? <p> " Ah , " Arnold said , with his most condescending smile . " You must be helping Constance out . It 's a lovely party , is n't it ? So wellorganized . Constance really amazes me , the way she can do this sort of thing and still keep that big lab churning out those papers . " <p> " Well , " Herb said . " But that last pair of papers , really . . . " Bianca fled . From the corner of her eye , she saw the man she 'd driven here , that Polish emigre , physical chemist turned theoretical structural biologist , Cambridge-based multiply-medaled old guy , standing all alone by the bamboo fountain , watching the water arc from the stem to the pool . Pleasing Constance inadvertently , she thought ; Constance fancied her home as a place conducive to contemplation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held it over his head , either feeling for hair that was no longer present or attempting to shade his gruesome array of freckles and liver spots from the burning sun . <p> Quickly Bianca traversed the yard and the patio , slipped through the glass doors and across the kitchen , and ran upstairs to the third and smallest bathroom . The door closed behind her with expensive precision : a Mercedes door , a jewel box door . On the vanity was a vase with a Zen-like twist of grapevine and a single yellow orchid . She opened the window and lit up a joint . Entirely typical , she thought , gazing down at Krzysztof 's sweaty pate . That Constance and Arnold and Herb and the others should fly this man across the ocean to hear about his work , then get so caught up in institute politics that they 'd forget to talk to him at their party . Had it not been for the lizard-like graze of his eyes across her chest , she might have felt sorry for him . <p> Of course Constance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would have been rude , she was never rude . After a few minutes he crouched down by the rock-rimmed basin and began touching a blade of grass to the water , dimpling the surface and thinking about van der Waals forces . Perhaps Constance caught the movement and thought he was feeling ill . She rushed to his side , she burbled and babbled . She asked him about common acquaintances at Cambridge . Did he want to swim ? but of course not , he should come sit here ; he knew everyone , did n't he ? She helped him into a long , low , elaborately curved chair , webbed with canvas that trapped him as securely as a fishnet . She seemed unaware that he could not rise from it unaided . And how could he say , as the faces bent toward him politely for one brief moment , then turned back to each other and their animated conversations about meetings he had n't attended , squabbles among colleagues he did n't know , that in fact he 'd forgotten almost all their names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appropriate faces and research problems ? <p> The sun had moved , was moving , so that first his knees then his thighs and crotch were uncomfortably roasted . Constance had brought him to the throne room , he saw . This cluster of chairs , perched where an adrenal gland would be if the pool were really a kidney , held her and him , Arnold and Herb , Jocelyn and Sundralingam . All the senior scientists . Directly across the pool the junior researchers stood in tight circles , occasionally glancing his way ; the postdocs and students were gathered at the farthest end of the pool , where a group of bare-torsoed , highly muscled young men had set fire to a long grill . The smoke rose in disturbing columns . He made columns in his mind : faces , names , research projects . Then he tried and failed to match up the lists . The girl named Rose walked by and smiled at him , and he smiled back eagerly but she continued to walk , past him and between a pair of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like dolls in a dark wood . He knew he 'd fallen asleep only when his own sudden , deep-throated snore woke him . <p> It was not dark yet , not nearly , but the sun had dropped and the sky was the most remarkable violet-blue . Perhaps it was six o'clock . A few people still swam in the pool , but most were out , and mostly dressed , and the smell of roasting fowl filled the air . Across the water , on the patio , people milled around the grill and the table with paper plates in their hands . Bottles of wine , bottles of beer , dripping glasses , ice ; he was , he realized , very thirsty . And past embarrassment , although the chairs near him were empty now , as if he 'd driven everyone away . Somehow he was not surprised , when he rolled sideways in an unsuccessful attempt to pull himself from his lounge chair , to see Bianca , cross-legged on the grass , smiling ironically as she watched over him . <p> " Have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . She seemed happy now ; what had he missed ? " But you know I can not get up from this thing . " She held out a hand , but it was not enough . " If you would , " he said , " just put your hands under my arms and lift . . " <p> Effortlessly she hauled him to his feet . " You want to go over toward the tables ? " <p> " Not just yet . Perhaps I 'll just sit here for a minute . " This time he chose a straight metal chair with a scallop-shell back . He sat gingerly , then more firmly . A fine chair , he 'd be able to get up himself . <p> " How about I go get you some food ? " <p> He sniffed the air . He had no appetite yet , and the smell of singeing flesh was strangely revolting . " Get something for yourself , " he said . " Maybe I 'll eat later . But I 'm terribly thirsty-do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Just some water ? " He remembered , then , the bottle in his bag . " And if you could find two small empty glasses as well , " he said . " I have a treat to share with you . " <p> When she returned he gulped gratefully at his glass of cold water . " Do you like vodka ? " he asked . " Me ? I 'll drink anything . " <p> He reached into his leather satchel and took out the bottle he 'd meant to give Constance . " You brought glasses ? " She held out two little paper cups , printed with blue and green daisies . " The best I could do . " <p> " Good enough . " He held up the heavy bottle , so that she could see the blade of grass floating blissfully inside . " Zubrowka , " he said . " Bison vodka , very special . It is flavored with the grass upon which the bison feed in the Bialowieza forest , where my family is from . A friend brings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I brought it here from Cambridge . " <p> " Cool " she said . " Should I get some ice ? " <p> " Never , " he said , shuddering . " We drink this neat , always . " He poured two shots and handed one to her . " You must drink it all in one gulp-do dna . To the bottom . " <p> " Bottoms up , " Bianca said . Together they tossed the shots down . Almost immediately he felt better . Bianca choked and shook her head , her pale hair flying in all directions . He forbade himself to look at her smooth neck or the legs emerging , like horses from the gate , from her white shorts . He focused on her nose and reminded himself that women her age saw men like him as trolls . Even ten years ago , the occasional women with whom he 'd forgotten himself had let him know this , and cruelly . How was it he still felt these impulses , then ? That the picture of himself he carried inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Take a sip of water , " he said . " It burns ! " <p> " Of course . But is n't it delicious ? " He refilled the ridiculous cups , and they drank again . She had spirit , he thought . This time she hardly choked at all . He tried to imagine her as the granddaughter of one of his oldest friends , himself as an elderly uncle . " Delicious , " she agreed . " It 's like drinking a meadow . Again ? " " Why not ? " <p> Around the left lobe of the kidney came Rose , a platter of charred chicken in her hand . Simultaneously , Krzysztof thought , she seemed to smile at him and glare at her sister , who was caught with the paper cup still at her lips . Was that a glare ? He could not figure out what was going on between these sisters . <p> " Welcome , " he said . And then , reluctantly-he could not help basking in Bianca 's undivided attention- " Will you join us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rose said . " But Constance wants to know if you 'd like to come over to the patio and have something to eat . " She thrust the platter toward his face . " The chicken 's great . " " Maybe later . " <p> " Bianca ? You want to come eat ? " <p> " No , " Bianca said firmly ; she seemed to be rejecting more than just the food . For a minute the sisters glared at each other-Children , Krzysztof thought ; then remembered Bianca 's earlier word . No , prodigies . All grown up-then Rose made a clicking sound with her tongue and walked away . <p> Her mouth tasted of meadows and trees , Bianca thought . As if she had been turned into a creature with hooves , suavely grazing in a dappled glade . The joint she 'd smoked earlier was still with her , but barely , palely ; this warmth in her veins , this taste in her mouth , were from the splendid bison vodka . And this man , whom at first she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sort of magician . Now it was beginning to seem like good fortune that everyone else had abandoned him to her care . The two of them rose from their chairs , on their way to join the crowd and examine the platters of food . But the voices on the patio seemed terribly loud , and someone over by the table was shrieking with laughter , a sound like metal beating metal . They drifted toward the Japanese fountain tucked in the shrubbery ; the same place she 'd seen Krzysztof standing earlier , all alone . He was smiling now , he had a wonderful smile . It distracted her from the odd way his lower lids sagged , exposing their pale pink inner membranes . " Is n't this a pretty thing ? " he asked , and she agreed . There were ferns surrounding one side of the fountain , lacy and strongly scented . She peered down into the stony basin and said , " We could just sit here for a bit . " <p> " We could , " he agreed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock . " <p> This time she knew just how to fit her hands into his armpits , and she got him seated with no fuss at all . " So what is it you do , exactly ? " she asked . When he hesitated , she said , " You know , I did do a couple years of graduate work in biochemistry . Remember ? It 's not like I ca n't understand . " <p> " I know that , " he said . " I know . It 's just that no one this whole visit has actually asked me anything . And I 'm more or less retired now . <p> " So what did you used to do ? " <p> His whole long life as a scientist stretched behind him , and he could hardly imagine how to tell it quickly . " In Krakow , " he said , " where I went to university , I was trained as a physical chemist specializing in polymers . I went to England , just before the Second World War " - he looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that painful history , all those desperate choices- " and after I 'd been there a little while , I was recruited to work on a secret project to develop artificial rubber . Then I studied alpha helices and similar structures in polymers , and then did some fiber-diffraction work on proteins . Once I gave up running a lab , I started doing more theoretical things . Thought-experiments . Do you know much thermodynamics ? " <p> " Enough to get by , " she said . " But that kind of heavy math was never my strong point . " <p> " I like to think about the thermodynamics of surfaces , and its relationship to the folding of globular proteins . You know , the buried residues inside the assembly and all that . There is a set of equations . . " <p> But Bianca shook her head . " Your bad luck , " she said . " I 'm probably the only person here who ca n't follow your math . " <p> " I can show you something , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Yes ? " she said . She was , she realized , wonderfully , happily drunk . Her companion , who was at least elated , reached into his magic bag once more . <p> " More vodka ? " she said . " I could do another shot . " " Absolutely . " The paper cups were soft-edged now , and partly crumpled , but he straightened their edges and filled them one more time . " There 's something else in here , though , " he said . <p> He delved around in the capacious bag , searching for the toys he always carried . Sometimes , when he traveled to foreign countries , his audiences were so diverse that he had to bring the level of his standard lecture down a notch , use visual aids so the biologists could grasp what he was saying as well as the biochemists and biophysicists . He had not had to use those aids here at the institute , where the staff prided themselves on their mathematical sophistication . But now his hand found the coil of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Perhaps , " he said , " if there was a way we could get a bowl of water ? " Bianca pointed at the basin just below them . " Water 's right here : ' <p> Had he not had so much zubrowka he might have considered more closely the relationship between the limpid water in the basin and the tiny stream trickling from the hollow bamboo . But he looked at the small pool and the eager , beautiful girl beside him , and without further thought he opened the bottle and poured several ounces of solution into the basin . From the wire he quickly fashioned several simple polygons . " Watch , " he said . <p> She watched . The voices from the patio faded , the ferns waved gently , her vision narrowed until she saw only his hands , the basin , the rocks where they sat . He dipped a wire shape in the basin and blew a large bubble ; then another , which he fastened to the first . More wire forms , more bubbles , more joinings-and before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complicated structure supported by almost nothing . <p> " See where the faces join ? " he said . " Those shapes the film makes as the faces join other faces ? " He launched into an explanation of molecular interactions that seemed simplistic to him , incomprehensible to her . " You see , " he said , " what a clear visual demonstration this is of the nature of surface tension . I stumbled on this some years ago , blowing regular old soap bubbles for the grandchildren of some friends of mine . " " That was n't soap ? " she said . " What you put in the water ? " " Not exactly-the film it makes is n't sturdy enough . There 's glycerine in here , some other things . . " He added two more bubbles to his airy construction . <p> There was a theory behind all this , Bianca knew . An idea that this growing structure of soap film and wire exemplified ; and she was the only person at this rarefied gathering incapable of grasping what he was trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue air , that bubble-structure elongating while he expounded on his ideas , she felt almost purely happy . Soon she would have to leave this place . Although she was closer to Rose than to anyone else in the world , so close they sometimes seemed to share a soul , she and Rose could not seem to get along now . At night , lying on the couch in Rose 's tiny apartment , she could feel the fierceness of Rose 's desire that she go back to school and continue the work they 'd shared since their father gave them their first chemistry set . Or , if she refused to do that , that she would go away and leave Rose to her own life . It had been a mistake , she knew , to follow Rose here to Philadelphia , graft herself even temporarily into Rose 's new world . But her job had only a few weeks to go , and she felt the pull of other places and lives , the same pull that had , in part , made her drop out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life would change . But at that moment , sitting on the rocks with Krzysztof , she felt as if he 'd led her to a castle from which she 'd been barred , opened the front door with a flourish , and then gaily flung open other doors one by one . The rooms were filled with sunlight and treasure . And although they were rooms she 'd given up , rooms that from now on would belong to Rose and not her , this moment of remembering that they existed comforted her like balm . <p> She said , " I had a grandfather who did wonderful tricks . Maybe not as good as this , but still , you would have liked him . He was from your part of the world , I think . I mean the part where you came from originally . " <p> " He was Polish ? " Krzysztof said eagerly . That she equated him with her grandfather was something he would n't think about now . " You have Polish blood ? " <p> " Sort of " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our grandfather 's name was Leo Marburg , and the story in our family goes that he had a German name but was born and raised in Poland , near some big forest somewhere . Or maybe it was Lithuania . But somehow he ended up in the Soviet Union , trying to establish vineyards in the Ukraine for the Communists , not long after the revolution . And then-this is all confused , my mother told me these stories when I was little-he came to America , and he worked as a janitor for a while , but then he found a job with one of the big wineries on the Finger Lakes . " <p> " Finger Lakes ? What are those ? " <p> She held up her right hand with the fingers outstretched . " Some long skinny lakes all next to each other , out in western New York , where I grew up . The glaciers made them . It 's a good place to grow grapes . When he 'd saved enough money , he bought some land of his own , and established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot about making wine . Grandpa Leo was still alive when Rose and I were tiny , and he used to bring us down into the corner of the cellar where he had his lab and show us all sorts of apparatus . The smells-it was like an alchemist 's cave . No bubbles , though . " <p> It was astounding , Krzysztof thought . What she left out , what she did n't seem to know . That Leo might have been hardly older than him , if he were still alive ; what did it mean , that he 'd worked once for the Soviets ? That he 'd escaped , made his way here , worked as a laborer , but then reestablished himself and his real life ? " So was he German , really ? " he asked . " Or Russian , or Polish ? " <p> " I do n't know , " she admitted . " He died when I was five or so , before I could ask him anything . Most of what I know about him my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were still girls . I do n't know much history , I guess . My own or anyone else 's . " <p> How could she tell him about her mother , whom she still missed every day ? And talked with , sometimes , although this was another point over which she and Rose quarreled bitterly . She felt a sudden sharp longing for her sister and craned her head toward the crowd behind her , but Rose had her back to them , she was talking with Vivek . She belonged with these people , as Bianca herself never would . " It 's because of Grandpa Leo " she said , " that I studied biochemistry in the first place . Because of him and my father and the winery . . : ' <p> " But you stopped , " Krzysztof said . " Why was that ? " She could not explain this to Rose , or even to herself : how could she explain it to him ? The argument she and Rose had had , when they were working together on one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been .

Everyone digging their own small corner of the field , so that in the end the field would flower-I did n't know it got so vicious . So competitive . I hate all this hustling for money and priority and space and equipment . Actually , " she said , " I hate these people . A lot of them . I really do . " <p> " We 're not very inspiring in groups , " Krzysztof said . " That 's true .

In northeastern Poland is this huge forest-the forest where the bison live , where this vodka comes from . That might have been the forest your mother meant in her stories . " " Do you think ? " <p> " It 's possible , " he said , and he repeated the name he 'd told her earlier : Bialowieza . Bianca tried to say it herself . " It 's a beautiful place , " he said . <p> " And there are bison there ? Real ones , I mean . Now ? " " There are , " he said . " It is partly because of my own mother that they still exist .

Do you want to get out of here for a while ? We 'd only be gone less than an hour , and you could tell me about the bison on the way . " <p> " I do n't want to be rude , " he said . <p> " I promise you , no one will notice . I 'll have you back so soon they 'll never know you 're gone . " <p> No one had approached them this last half hour ; the other guests had taken root , on the grass and the steps and the chairs , and were eating and drinking busily , arguing and laughing and thrusting their chins at each other . But a threat loomed , in the person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Although she was chattering with a postdoc about her work with adhesives , she was sending glances Krzysztof 's way , and these made him shudder . At dinner , the previous night , he 'd been stuck with her for an hour while she explained the chemistry of what made things sticky , but not too sticky . As if he did n't know . She worked for some huge corporation ; the net result of her work , if he remembered it right , had something to do with those small yellow slips of paper that now littered all other sheets of paper , and on which his colleagues scribbled curt notes . How vulgar she was . If he and Bianca continued to sit by this fountain , the woman would eventually sidle over to them . The possibility was unbearable . <p> He held out his arms to Bianca . " If you would ? " Just then the low cylinders in the shrubberies lit up all at once , casting a warm light on the paths and the pool and the patio-yes , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasteful lanterns , meant to look faintly Oriental . <p> " My pleasure , " she said . She raised him and held her finger to her lips in a gesture of silence . Then , to his delight , she led him through the ferns and azaleas until they disappeared around the side of the house , unseen by anyone . Krzysztof was too pleased by their cunning escape to tell Bianca how badly he needed to urinate . <p> They drove toward the glorious red horizon , as if chasing the vanished sun . Although the road was narrow and twisted and sunken , almost like an English road , Bianca drove very fast . Krzysztof clutched the dash at first , but then relaxed ; what was left of his hair lifted and fanned in the wind , tugging at his scalp like a lover 's hands and distracting him from the pressure in his bladder . <p> " Is there any of that vodka left ? " Bianca asked . He handed her the bottle and watched as she held it to her lips . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bison . " <p> He stuck one hand through the open window , letting it cut into the rushing breeze like a knife ; then tilted it slightly and let the air push his arm up . " I was born and raised in Krakow , " he said . Had he told her that already ? " But my mother grew up in the country , in this forest where perhaps your grandfather was from . It is so beautiful , you ca n't imagine-it is the last bit of primeval forest in Europe , the trees have never been cut . There are owls there , and roe deer and storks and bears . And it was the last place where the wild bison , the zubre , lived . When my mother was young the Russians controlled that part of Poland and the forest was the tsar 's private hunting preserve . " <p> " Your mother was Russian ? " <p> " No-Polish . Defiantly , absolutely Polish . " He almost stopped here , overwhelmed by the complexities of Polish history . But it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fault that she knew nothing and that , if he were to hand her a map , she could not place Poland more than vaguely . " After she married my father they moved to Krakow-he was an organic chemist , he taught at the university there . During the First World War he was conscripted into the Austrian Army and disappeared . We do n't even know where he died . So it was just my mother and me after that . When the war was over and I started university myself , we heard stories about how the German armies trapped in the forest during the war 's last winter started eating the zubre after they 'd finished off the lynx and wild boars and weasels . There were only a thousand or so of them left in the world . The forests had been cleared everywhere else in Europe , and rich people had been hunting them for centuries . Then those German soldiers ate all the rest . What could they do ? They were freezing , and starving , and they butchered the zubre with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her father had been a forester , and she 'd grown up watching the bison grazing on buttercups under the oaks . " <p> Bianca interrupted him-suddenly he seemed old again , he was wandering . And crossing and uncrossing his legs like a little boy who had to pee . Was a bison the same as a buffalo ? In graduate school she had once met a man , a philosopher , who raised buffalo with his wife not far from Ithaca and peddled the meat . Lean , dark , a little tough . <p> " This is Meadowbrook , " she said , gesturing at the gigantic houses and formal gardens tucked back from the road they whizzed along ; hoping to pull him back to the present . " Is n't that a ridiculous name ? All the rich people live here . And so do Rose and I , sort of-she has a little apartment above the garage of one of these estates . It used to be the gardener 's quarters-over there , see that big stone house ? " <p> She gestured vaguely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whatever house she 'd pointed out had vanished . Suddenly she slowed and turned the van down a narrow lane between two stone pillars . " Almost here , " she said . <p> He hurried on with his story , sensing that time was short . He skipped everything personal , all his struggles between the two great wars . He skipped the strange evolution of his mother 's heart , the way she had left him alone in Krakow and returned to the forest of her youth , burning with a desire to rebuild what had been destroyed . The way she had turned in disgust from his work , from every kind of science but forestry . <p> " The bison were gone by the end of the war , " he said . " Almost extinct . But near the end of the twenties , a Polish forester started trying to reestablish a breeding stock-and my mother moved back to the Bialowieza , to help him . There were a few in a zoo in Stockholm , and some in zoos in Hamburg and Berlin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Poland . And my mother and this man , they brought some females from that little group to the forest , and borrowed bulls from the zoos , and they started a breeding program . From them come all the European bison left in the world . There are several thousand of them now-because of my mother , you see ? My own mother . " <p> They were in a forest of sorts right now-the lane grew narrower and turned into a dirt track , and trees brushed the side of the van . When they emerged into a small clearing , Bianca stopped the van without saying a word in response to his tale . <p> " I run here , " she said . " Almost every night . It 's a park , this place . But no one comes here , I never see any people . I like to run just before dark . " For a second he pictured her , pounding down the dirt paths ; perhaps this explained her extraordinary legs . She came around to his side of the van @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's beautiful " he said . Why had he been telling her that story ? The forest , his mother , the starving soldiers ; the bison , so huge and wild , just barely rescued from oblivion . That part ended happily . The rest , which he would never tell Bianca , did not : during the Blitzkrieg the German army had overrun the forest in a matter of weeks . Then it had passed to the Russians , then back to the Germans ; swastikas had flown from the roofs . The resident Jews had been slaughtered under those ancient oaks , and the farmers and foresters had been deported . His mother had disappeared . And all the while he had been safe in England , unable to persuade her to join him . Unable to save her , or anyone . In test tubes he had grown chains of molecules , searching for something that might be turned into tires for planes and jeeps . <p> " It 's a national park now , that forest , " he said , unable to let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbearable , and he said , " Would you excuse me for a minute ? " He stepped behind an oak and into a thorny tangle , disappearing in the brambles . Behind him , Bianca was puzzled and then amused as she heard the long splatter of liquid on leaves , a pause , more splatter , a sigh . The sigh was one of pleasure ; even this simple act was no longer reliable , and Krzysztof felt such relief as his urine flowed over the greenery that he was hardly embarrassed when he emerged and Bianca gently pointed out the bit of shirttail emerging from his fly like a tongue . <p> After he tidied himself , Bianca led him across a muddy field and into the trees at the far edge of the clearing . The sky had turned a smoky violet gray , truly dusk , all traces of red disappeared and with it the color of the leaves and Bianca 's hair . <p> " No bison here " she said cheerfully . " But I think we made it just in time . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suburb . This is the only bit of real woods left for miles . But something kept eating everything Rose planted in her garden , and when I started jogging here I found out what it was . Be quiet now . " <p> He was . He was exhausted , remarkably drained , the vodka swirling through his veins . The marzipan-like taste of the bison grass ; was it that flavor the secretive , lumbering creatures had craved as they grazed ? The only time he had visited his mother in the forest , just before he left for England , she had fed him a dish of wild mushrooms , wild garlic , and reindeer , washed down with this vodka . He had tried to persuade her that war was inevitable . Her hair was gray by then , she no longer looked anything like Bianca . She lived in a low dark hut by herself and said she would rather die than leave her home again . <p> A deer appeared in the clearing . He blinked his eyes ; it had not been there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , " she whispered . " We made it just in time . " He blinked again : four deer , then eleven , then seventeen . They came out of the trees and stood in the gathering darkness , looking calmly at each other and at the sky . How beautiful they were . He squeezed Bianca 's hand , which was unaccountably folded within his own . <p> She stood very still . Night after night , during these long strange weeks , she had left Rose 's cramped apartment and their difficult quarrels , slipped on her running shoes , and sped down the long driveway , past the houses of the wealthy , across the busy suburban road , and into this park . And almost every night she was rewarded with this vision . She could hear her mother 's voice then , as if the deer were transmitting it ; they seemed unafraid of her and often stayed for half an hour . Tonight they were edgy , though . Their tails twitched and their ears rotated like tiny radar dishes ; their heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Krzysztof were hidden . They were nothing like bison . They were dainty and delicate-footed , completely at home here and yet so out of place beyond the confines of this small haven . Still she could not figure out either how or when they crossed the bustling road between the park and Rose 's apartment to browse on the lettuce and peas . <p> She did not have to tell Krzysztof not to speak ; he stood like a tree , wonderfully still and silent . But his face gleamed , she saw . As if he 'd been sprayed with water ; was he crying ? Suddenly one doe leapt straight up , turned in the air , and then bounded away . The others quickly followed . It was dark , the show was over . " You okay ? " she whispered . <p> " Fine , " he said . " That was lovely . Thank you . " " My pleasure . " <p> She slipped an arm beneath his elbow to guide him back through the muddy part of the field , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was himself . He strode firmly over the ruts and ridges . " It 's hard to believe there 's a place like this so close to the congestion , " he said . <p> She was behind him , unable to make out his words . " What ? " she said . <p> He turned his head over his shoulder to repeat his comment . As he did so , his right foot plunged into a deep hole . For a moment he tottered between safety and harm , almost in balance , almost all right . Then he tipped and tilted and was down in the mud , looking up at the first stars . In the emergency room , the nurses and residents were very impatient with them . No one seemed able to sort out Krzysztof 's health insurance situation : what were these British papers and cards , this little folder marked Traveler 's Insurance ? Then there was the vodka on his breath , and Bianca 's storm of hysterical tears ; for some minutes the possibility of calling the police was raised . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you his girlfriend ? " one nurse said . From Bianca 's shocked rebuttal , Krzysztof understood that , just as he 'd feared , she had never seen him , not for one moment , as an actual man . Almost he was tempted to tell her how clearly , and in what detail , he 'd imagined her naked . She sat in an orange plastic chair and sobbed while he was wheeled in and out of rooms , his veiny white legs exposed in the most humiliating fashion . And this exposure was what distressed him most , although more friends than he could count had met their deaths through just such casual falls . Somehow the possibility of actual bodily harm had not occurred to him as he lay calmly regarding the stars from the muddy field . <p> " The ankle 's not broken , " a young doctor finally said . " But it 's badly sprained . " <p> " So he 's all right ? " Bianca kept saying . " He 's all right ? " She could not seem to calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors drew a curtain around Krzysztof and went to work . <p> An hour later Krzysztof emerged with his lower leg encased in two rigid plastic forms , each lined with a green plastic air-filled pod . Velcro straps clamped the shells around him , as if his ankle were an oyster . A boy young enough to be his grandson had given him two large white pills in a white pleated cup , which resembled in miniature the nurse 's cap worn by a woman he 'd loved during the war ; the woman 's name had vanished , as had the pain , and his entire body felt blissful . Bianca carried the crutches , and a sheaf of instructions and bills . She opened the van 's side door and tried to help as two men lifted Krzysztof from the wheelchair and draped him along the back seat . <p> All the way back to Constance 's house , Bianca drove slowly , avoiding potholes and sudden swerves . " Are you all right ? " she asked every few minutes . " Is this hurting you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt so good in years . " Actually this long narrow seat was more comfortable than the vast bed in his hotel . The jacket Bianca had folded into a pillow beneath his head smelled of her ; the whole van was scented with her presence . On the floor , just below his face , he saw nylon shoes with flared lumpy soles and socks and shirts and reeds and a bird 's nest , a canvas sack and a withered orange . Behind his seat was a mat and a sleeping bag . " Do you sleep in here ? " he asked . <p> " I have-but not these last weeks . I 'm so sorry , I never meant-I ca n't believe this happened . " " My fault ; ' he said . " Entirely . You must n't blame yourself . " " Everyone else will , " she said bitterly . " Everyone . " <p> Should she bring him straight back to his hotel ? But she had to stop at Constance 's house , let Constance and the others decide what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him stay with her . It was past eleven , they 'd been gone for hours ; and although Bianca had had plenty of time to call from the hospital , the phone booth had seemed impossibly far away , and malignant . Now the only honest thing to do was to show up , with her guilty burden , and admit to everyone what had happened . Behind her , Krzysztof was humming . Stoned out of his gourd , she thought ; she would have given anything for their positions to be reversed . <p> " Talk to me , " he said . " It 's lonely back here . All I can see is the back of your head . " <p> " Those bison , " she said . " Are they anything like our buffalo ? " " Similar , " he said . " But bigger . Shaggy in the same way , though : ' <p> " I heard this thing once , " she said . " From a friend of my mother 's , who used to visit the winery when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of naturalist , I think he studied beetles . Once he said , I think he said , that the buffalo out west had almost gone extinct , but then some guy made a buffalo refuge in Montana , and stocked it with animals from the Bronx Zoo . Like your mother did , you see ? " For a minute her own mother 's face hovered in the air lit by her headlights . <p> The van slowed and made a broad gentle curve-Constance 's circular driveway , Krzysztof guessed . " In Polish , " he said dreamily , " the word for beetle is chrzaszcz . " Bianca tried to repeat the word , mashing together the string of consonants in a way he found very sweet . How pleasing that after all she 'd paid attention to his stories . Their slow progress through the afternoon and evening had culminated properly among the deer , not here , and all of it had been worthwhile . <p> " We 're here , " she said . " Boy , this is going to be awful-just wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on , and we 'll see what to do . " <p> She turned and touched his head , preparing to face her sister . " Do n't worry , " he said gently . " I 'll tell everyone I asked you to take me for a drive . I had a lovely evening , you know . I 'm very glad to have met you . " <p> Neither of them knew that out back , beyond the rubble of the party , large sturdy bubbles had been forming for hours at the lip of the bamboo fountain , to the mystification of everyone . They did not see the bubbles , nor the inside of the house , because Rose and Constance came flying out the front door to greet the van . Terrified , Bianca saw . And then , as she prepared the first of many explanations , the first clumsy attempt at the story she 'd tell for years , with increasing humor and a kind of self-deprecation actually meant to charm in the most shameful way , she saw their faces change : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In an instant she had thrown the van into gear again and stomped on the gas . Krzysztof said , " Where . . . ? " and as they lurched back onto the road , leaving behind Constance and Rose and the fountain and the lanterns , the squabbling scientists , the whole world of science , she said , " Back to your hotel , you need to be in your own bed . " <p> Back , Krzysztof thought . Back to the airport , back to England , back across the ocean and Europe toward home ; back to the groves of Bialowieza , where his mother might once have crossed paths with Bianca 's grandfather . Might have escaped , like him ; might have survived and adopted another name and life during all the years when , in the absence of family or friends , her only son shuttled between his laboratory and his little flat and the rooms of the women who one by one had tried and failed to comfort him . Back and back and back and back . Where had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Bianca-her foot heavy on the accelerator-thought , Away . She had her wallet and her sleeping bag and her running shoes and her van ; and she drove as if this were the point from which the rest of her life might begin . <p>
