<p> Kathryn Lewis had just finished her first year at college and was spending the day at a lake in Georgia when she was thrown from a motorboat and battered by its whirling propeller blades . She died almost instantly . <p> Soon after the 1993 accident , Vicki and Gary Lewis sued the boat manufacturer , Brunswick Corp. , because they believed their daughter might have lived had there been a safety guard on the boat 's propeller . The couple spent nearly five years struggling through the legal system , losing at every turn . Eventually , after a long-shot appeal to the Supreme Court , the justices agreed to take the case and heard oral arguments in March . Only 1 percent of the cases appealed to the high court are accepted , which makes what happened last week all the more remarkable : Rather than waiting for the justices to rule , the Lewises decided to settle . <p> Furthermore , their decision made Lewis v. Brunswick Corp . the third dispute this year to be settled after the justices had already agreed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after oral arguments were held and the justices were writing a decision . <p> That situation is so rare that records show no other instance of a settlement after oral arguments in the past five years , and longtime court observers say they can not remember such an instance in earlier terms . <p> Last November , when civil rights groups financed a surprise out-of-court settlement with a white schoolteacher who was laid off to save a black teacher 's job in Piscataway , N.J. , it was front-page news across the nation . But even in that unusual case , the intervention came before the justices had begun deliberations . <p> The rarity of such settlements is hardly surprising given the odds of reaching the high court . Of the 7,500 appeals the justices get each term , they take only about 85 . And each case represents years of tumult in lower courts and hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal costs . If the two parties had wanted to settle , they would have had plenty of opportunity to do that before they got to the Supreme Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' illustrates that no matter how far they are into the process , one side may believe there is a greater cost to an adverse ruling from the Supreme Court that would establish a national precedent . <p> In the Lewis case , fear that the justices could create a new legal standard played a crucial role in Brunswick 's approach . Beyond the motorboat industry , the case had drawn interest from a range of national manufacturers such as General Motors Corp . because the underlying legal issue could affect other regulation  --  of automobiles , for example , and disputes over manufacturers ' failure to install air bags . <p> Vicki Lewis said the decision to sue Brunswick was one that she , her husband and their other four children made shortly after her daughter 's death . " We thought Kathee would have wanted us to do this , " she said from her home in Healdton , Okla . <p> The suit was filed under personal-injury law in Georgia , where Lewis had been vacationing with her boyfriend 's family . The family argued that state law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's death by failing to install a guard over motorboat propeller blades . But Brunswick argued that because the Coast Guard does not require boat makers to install propeller guards , manufacturers could not be held financially responsible for the injuries . <p> The courts ultimately sided with Brunswick . <p> " The loss of a child is always a tragic thing , " Joe Pomeroy , general counsel for Brunswick 's marine division , acknowledged last week . But he added that , even if there had been a propeller guard on the boat , it 's unlikely it would have saved Kathee Lewis 's life . <p> Brunswick had won similar lawsuits on the same legal grounds that applied in the Lewis case . What remained an open question in many courts was whether the Coast Guard 's decision not to require propeller guards rose to the level of a federal rule that would trump the state 's personal injury law . <p> Against the odds , the Lewises appealed to the Supreme Court , and to the surprise of many  --  not the least , Brunswick  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boost for the Lewises came soon after : The Justice Department entered the case on their side , telling the court that , without any definitive federal regulation on propeller guards , nothing should stop survivors from filing a " wrongful death " lawsuit in state court . <p> " Kathee would have been pleased , " Vicki Lewis said of the optimism she felt at that point . " Here was just a little girl from Healdton , Oklahoma , who had made it all the way the Supreme Court . " <p> The case was argued before the justices in March , and it went well for the Lewises . A few weeks later , Vicki Lewis received a call from her attorney , David Hudson , saying Brunswick wanted to settle . <p> " It took most of a weekend to decide what to do , " said Vicki Lewis , who had become involved in national efforts to prevent propeller injuries . " We just really prayed . We had been at this for five years , and even if we won it would mean two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kathee would want us to stop , to put some closure to it . " <p> For Brunswick , the settlement offer was a way to try to head off a ruling against the company that could influence other cases , which had been going their way . Until the time of oral arguments , the company had made no serious efforts to settle . <p> Kenneth S. Geller , a leading appellate lawyer hired by Brunswick to make its case at the high court , said the manufacturer 's position was " strong . " But he acknowledged the risk of an adverse national policy . <p> " Brunswick did n't take this case to the Supreme Court , " he said , referring to the fact that the court had granted the Lewises ' appeal . " It had won almost all of these propeller guard cases in lower courts . So Brunswick was delighted to maintain the status quo . " <p> Other propeller injury cases are in lower courts , but it is likely to be a few years before another reaches the justices . <p> Neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the settlement amount . But two other people who were close to the negotiations estimated Brunswick paid out about $ 700,000 , which for Vicki and Gary Lewis ( a homemaker and truck driver ) was significant money . <p> There is disagreement over whether the public interest is served when settlements intercept national policy on whether accident victims can sue manufacturers or how broad affirmative action can be . <p> " Corporations always have the money to buy out and control the development of the law , " says Arthur Bryant , executive director of Trial Lawyers for Public Justice . " Very rarely do people on the public interest side or the individual plaintiffs ' side have the resources to purchase out the other side 's interest . " <p> But Malcolm E. Wheeler , a Denver lawyer who specializes in business cases , said all lawyers devoted to a particular area of the law weigh the stakes of an individual case with their quest for a broad , national principle . " Some of the most effective maneuvering in the courts has been in race relations and gender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case settled this term , Caterpillar v. United Automobile Workers , was resolved as part of a larger pact negotiated between Caterpillar and the union . Arguments had been held in January in the case testing whether an employer or union should pay for employees who are on leave handling union grievances . The huge Caterpillar-UAW pact was ratified in March , immediately removing the dilemma from the high court . <p> How the court would have ruled in that case or the handful of others through the years will never be known . Said Geller , " It 's like reading a novel and having the last page torn out . "
