<p> THE STORY OF THE WARSAW GHETTO UPRISING <p> Editor  --  Your July 10 front page article on Poland incorporates a grievous misrepresentation of Holocaust history . We find it incredible that the description of the Warsaw Ghetto does not mention Jews . It completely overlooks the fact that the reason hundreds of thousands of people were isolated , brutalized and murdered in the ghetto was because they were Jews , not because they were Poles . <p> After experiencing disease , starvation and death for years , many of the remaining desperate Jews decided it was better to fight than quietly be murdered . Virtually ignored by the Polish underground , these Jews on their own kept vastly superior German forces occupied for almost two months . In the end , most of these courageous Jewish fighters were either killed or captured and later murdered in the death camps . <p> This extraordinary episode in Jewish history was inspirational to non-Jew and Jew alike in Nazi- occupied Europe by offering the possibility of local armed resistance against the German army . <p> Poland should not be defined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but is better understood through the course of oppression and resistance in its history . The revisionist perspective exemplified in your article writes the Jews out of Poland and excises the Holocaust from the European experience . This is bad history and an insult to Jewish memory . <p> FRED ASTREN , <p> Associate Professor <p> LAURIE ZOLOTH-DORFMAN , <p> Associate Professor <p> Jewish Studies Program <p> San Francisco State University <p> . <p> WHO THE VICTIMS WERE <p> Editor  --  Having read through Frank Viviano 's otherwise excellent article on Poland , I was aghast at the glaring  --  seemingly deliberate  --  omission of any mention whatever of Jews or Judaism . In his review of that country 's tortured past , the Warsaw Ghetto and its fate figure prominently . Yet not a word is breathed about just who those " 450,000 human beings " were . They were Jews , Mr. Viviano ; and that ghetto 's heroic , hopeless revolt against the Nazis was a revolt for Jewish dignity and life . <p> Poland 's ancient Jewish communities comprised about 10 percent of the country 's prewar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ echoes of the past endure  --  such as country roads paved with shards of Hebrew-engraved tombstones . <p> As Poland looks westward , Poles can no longer afford to ignore or suppress such a salient aspect of their nation 's past , and it certainly does not behoove an American newspaper to abet such a distortion of history . <p> Dr. S. BEN-MENAHEM <p> Stanford University <p> . <p> ONE MAN 'S OBSESSION <p> Editor  --  The new ordinance banning public nudity in the city of Pacifica is the culmination of one man 's ridiculous obsession with surfers changing in the parking lot of his restaurant . <p> Although I agree that dining patrons should not be subjected to the sight of people changing in and out of wetsuits , I object to a ban on public nudity specifically aimed at surfers . <p> The changing facilities mentioned by Pacifica Mayor Maxine Gonsalves are littered with garbage and human waste , and from a public health standpoint make these facilities arguably a greater concern than a few instances of inadvertent flashing . <p> Surfers do not change in and out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can surf . <p> JESSE L. VILLAR <p> South San Francisco <p> . <p> END CAR , ROAD SUBSIDIES <p> Editor  --  If the Alameda County transportation sales tax is reauthorized ( " Cities , Suburbs Vie for Transit Funds in Alameda County , " Chronicle , July 14 ) , the majority of funds should go to investments that lessen our dependence on single-occupancy vehicles . Our increasingly congested highways , worsening air quality and withering AC Transit service are largely the result of subsidies to roads and cars . Using the sales tax to pay for roads will only make these problems worse . <p> To solve transportation problems , we should pay for roads with user fees , such as the gas tax , and use the sales tax for public transit , bike paths and open space acquisition . <p> MEG KREHBIEL <p> Environmental Defense Fund <p> Oakland <p> . <p> FAIR UTILITY COMPETITION <p> Editor  --  In their July 2 opinion piece , writers Alan Ramo and Eugene Coyle criticize deregulation of the electric utility industry , saying it will result in increased pollution and higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumers , utilities and lawmakers spent years crafting a fair plan to bring competition  --  and lower electric prices  --  to the industry . Last year , California lawmakers unanimously passed AB 1890 , electric restructuring legislation . Some facts : <p> * Electric rates for California 's residential and small commercial customers are expected to drop 10 percent on Jan. 1 , 1998 , remaining at that level for the next four years . This will reduce these customers ' bills by more than $ 400 million annually . <p> * Also on January 1 , California consumers will be able to buy electricity from suppliers other than traditional investor-owned utilities . <p> * In 2002 , electric rates are expected to drop again . <p> In the new arena , PG &E; will focus on operating safe and reliable transmission and distribution systems to deliver power from any number of suppliers to PG &E; customers . <p> To ensure that utilities do not control the energy marketplace and that competitive prices develop , regulators have encouraged utilities to sell a portion of their power plants . <p> PG &E; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco . The California Public Utilities Commission must approve the sale . By suggesting the plant sales will result in a six-fold emission increase , Ramo and Coyle ignore the fact that the new owners  --  like PG &E;  --  must operate the plants in compliance with environmental standards that are among the strictest in the nation . <p> Critics will try to thwart change and mislead consumers . But presented with the facts , Californians  --  like their elected representatives  --  will recognize the benefits of customer choice and competition in the electric utility industry . <p> GORDON R.

One would hope that the main newspaper of a world-class city would show a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base presentation . <p> The man has enough problems without his personal affairs being aired for the entertainment of gossips and other morons . You should be ashamed . <p> JIM HODGE <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST <p> Editor  --  A reader suggested ( Letters , July 16 ) that bikers be permitted to run stop signs in order not to lose " precious momentum and much of the enjoyment . . . " Motorists would be expected to yield accordingly . <p> The suggestion disregards the fact that at most applicable intersections , a driver traveling at posted speed limits will not be able to see a side-street cyclist in time to stop before the rider speeds through the stop sign in full and joyous momentum into the car 's path . <p> If the system is implemented , the iron rule of survival of the fittest will eventually resolve the controversy between car and bicycle . <p> AL SARTOR <p> Walnut Creek <p> . <p> CLASS OF ' 47 SEARCH <p> Editor  --  I would appreciate it very much if you would help in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Castlemont High School , Oakland .
