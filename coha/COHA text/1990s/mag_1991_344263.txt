His hyperkinetic nerdiness was irresistible to millions of children . Pee-wee Herman was a grownup version of little brother : winsome , goofy , capable of saying dumb things and beatifically happy with the panorama of this world . When Pee-wee talked to inanimate objects , like chairs , they talked back , which , as everyone under 10 knows , is just what they are supposed to do . This man-boy with the tight suit , googly eyes and lipsticked mouth was not every parent 's cup of tea : add a leer and the little guy could pass for the emcee of a Berlin nightclub , circa 1935 . But few had any qualms about their offspring spending time in his company : at the movies ( Pee-wee 's Big Adventure , Big Top Pee-wee ) or watching Pee-wee 's Playhouse , the Emmy Award-winning Saturday- morning TV show that has run on CBS since 1986 . <P> The network canceled his series in April  --  the summer slot was to have been filled out with reruns  --  and last week Pee-wee was effectively slaughtered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 39 , the actor who created and played the Pee-wee character for more than 10 years , had been arrested in a Sarasota , Fla. , porn-movie theater and charged with " exposure of sexual organs , " which translates as masturbating . <P> Through his publicist , Reubens denied the accusation , but that little detail hardly registered among the seismic aftershocks of the original arrest . Reubens ' mug shots made the front pages ; heavy psychological hitters like Dr. Lee Salk and Dr. Joyce Brothers were enlisted to advise parents on what to tell the kids . The radio and TV airwaves were suddenly alive with Pee-wee jokes ( His favorite baseball team ? The Montreal Expos . His next television project ? A remake of Diff'rent Strokes ) . CBS yanked the five remaining repeat episodes of Pee-wee 's Playhouse , and the Disney-MGM Studios pulled a two- minute clip including Pee-wee that was being shown during backstage tours of its theme park in Orlando . <P> Courageous moves by these entertainment giants , no doubt protecting an unsuspecting public from . . . what exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mikhail Gorbachev met in Moscow to reduce nuclear arsenals , and while severed human heads and scattered skeletal remains were being traced to a mass murderer in Milwaukee  --  can be seen as a trifle excessive . If Reubens is guilty of anything , it is of making a very bad career move . Solitary sexual acts performed in public , even in a darkened movie theater showing fare expressly designed to stimulate sexual acts , are a legal no-no . For people whose livelihood depends on public image , committing such deeds where those individuals are likely to be recognized carries a heavier penalty , which , in Reubens ' case , seems to be a kangaroo court , public hanging and quick burial on TV boot hill .
