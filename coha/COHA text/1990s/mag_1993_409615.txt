Death has a way of putting a backspin on things , so that what seemed to Keith Blum like a lighthearted moment a few weeks ago now looms chillingly real . Blum , co-owner of a hair salon in the Los Angeles suburb of Woodland Hills , was telling a joke to a tenant from the neighboring Warner Plaza shopping center . " If you were locked in a room with Saddam , the Ayatollah Khomeini and a lawyer , and you had a gun with two bullets in it , " Blum asked his acquaintance , 55-year-old mortgage broker Gian Luigi Ferri , " who would you shoot ? " The Italian immigrant , who had heard the gag before , replied , " The lawyer-twice . " Then he erupted in laughter so explosive he had to take off his glasses to wipe the tears from his eyes . Three weeks later , on the sunny Thursday afternoon of July 1 , Ferri was not joking as he rode up the elevator in a sleek 48-story glass-and-granite tower in San Francisco 's financial district . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the 34th-floor offices of the law firm of Pettit &; Martin , he looked right at home  --  he was wheeling a black canvas satchel on the kind of dolly commonly used by attorneys to haul documents . But the bag hid a deadly cargo : two 9-mm Intratec TEC-9 pistols capable of firing more than 50 times before reloading , a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun and hundreds of rounds of ammunition . ( All had been legally purchased in Nevada this year . ) Down the hushed hallway to the right , Ferri walked slowly toward the glass-enclosed conference room . There , Jody Jones Sposato , 30 , the mother of a 10-month-old girl , Megan , was giving a deposition in her sexual discrimination suit against a former employer . Representing her on a contingency basis was Jack Berman , 35 , a well-liked labor specialist known around his firm of Bronson Bronson &; McKinnon as " the lawyer with a conscience . " Sposato was being questioned by Sharon Jones O'Roke , 35 , an attorney serving along with lawyers from Pettit &; Martin as the former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was recording the proceedings when bullets began crashing through the glass . As Eaves dived for cover under the table , she was hit in the right arm . O'Roke was wounded in the head , chest and arms . Berman and his client were n't so lucky . As Ferri continued to rake the room , they were both shot dead . Near the conference room , legal secretary Elizabeth Newark heard screams and smelled gunpowder . She started to dial 911 but had only punched the first digit when the gun man appeared . " He looked at me , and his face was blank , " says the 60ish former Londoner . " He was n't interested in me . I gather he was interested in the lawyers . " As Newark stood frozen , her boss , partner Brian Berger , yelled at her to run . But Berger did n't take his own advice . He went into the office of colleague Allen J. Berk to warn him of the danger  --  just before Ferri opened fire on them . Berger , a 39-year-old litigator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Partner Berk , 52 , a distinguished labor specialist , died at his desk . On the 35th floor , partner J. Ronald Pengilly , 59 , had just started down the elegant interior staircase for a 3 p.m. appointment with a colleague when he ran into a stampede of people rushing from the floor below . He joined the group in running to the fire stairwell . " I went down about two steps , and the gunman came into the fire stairs at the 34th floor . I was about eight feet from him , " Pengilly says . " He did n't look up , thank God , or I might not be here . " Pengilly and those with him dashed for the elevators and made it to safety . Ferri continued down one floor and found other quarry . From the moment they met as freshmen at Washington State 's Gonzaga University , easygoing Hawaiian surfer John Scully and charming Oregon native Michelle Spiess were virtually inseparable . Nine years later , John , 28 , an associate at Pettit &; Martin , and Michelle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were still rarely apart . That afternoon Michelle was visiting her husband , consulting some law books . When John heard there was a gunman in the building , he ran to get her . Rounding a corner , the couple spotted Ferri . He was fatally wounding intern David Sutcliffe , 30 , a first-year law student at the University of Colorado , Boulder . Ferri also saw them . He pursued the pair into an empty office where , Michelle said , John used his muscular 6 ' ' 5 " body to try to shield her from harm . As he lay dying , John instructed his wife , shot in the arm , on how to dial out for help . Emergency vehicles were already converging on the high-rise , which is near the tourist-clogged Embarcadero waterfront . As SWAT teams began a sweep of the building , Ferri continued down the fire stairs to the 32nd floor . At the Trust Company of the West he killed secretary Shirley Mooser , a 64-year-old widow , and investment manager Donald " Mike " Merrill , 48 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fogel , 33 , of San Rafael as she sat in colleague Paul Smith 's office . Smith says Fogel 's last words were concern about what would happen to her " roommate "  --  her pet miniature poodle , Ruby . Next , Ferri 's bullets hit Vicky Smith , a Trust Company marketing vice president , and Pettit &; Martin attorney Charles Ross , both 41 . But by then his two Intratec pistols had overheated and jammed . Heading down the fire stairs he found himself trapped between two converging groups of police . Ferri stuck the third gun under his chin and fired a final fatal shot . It was some 15 minutes since he had entered the building . For several hours , as frantic relatives and friends who had heard news of the carnage gathered outside , SWAT teams continued to comb the office tower for other possible suspects . Around 10:30 p.m. , Jody Sposato 's husband , Stephen , 30 , an engineer with Pacific Bell , found out the bad news . " They invited me to go to the coroner 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And my life was shattered . " Authorities and acquaintances are still struggling to understand what triggered the random rampage , the eruption of decades of pent-up rage and paranoia . " When they told me it was Gian , I could n't believe it , " says Tai Salisbury , 23 , Ferri 's former assistant at his failing ADF Mortgage . " You do n't expect that from someone you know , no matter how lonely and sad and miserable he is . " " It is astonishing , " said Ferri 's ex-wife , Donna Jean Benedetti , who was married to him for a reported eight years ending in 1977 . " The man I married hated violence . " During their time together , Ferri , a 1964 immigrant who earned a bachelor 's degree in biology and psychology from the University of California at Santa Cruz nine years later , worked as a paraprofessional Bay Area mental health counselor for Marin County 's Department of Health and Human Services . After the divorce , Ferri began volunteering for Rev. Terry Cole-Whittaker , a former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Your Divine Right . It became Ferri 's gospel . But whether the project was real estate development or financial services , Ferri seemed to have had the Midas touch in reverse . The next decade and a half of his life is a litany of soured deals and financial decline . Bad luck appears to have played a part , but the would-be entrepreneur was n't helped by failure to do his homework and an occasionally explosive temper . " He did n't know what he was doing , " says Salisbury , who claims her former boss did n't even know the procedure to verify deposits . Last fall Ferri consulted lawyers in Los Angeles , where he had been living for the past year , about declaring personal bankruptcy , but could n't afford the firm 's $2,500 fee . In June , Ferri failed to pay the rent of between $700 and $800 on the one-bedroom apartment in Woodland Hills where he lived by himself . He got a Pay or Quit notice giving him two weeks to settle the balance . Some insight into Ferri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police found on his body . In it he railed against " CRIMINALS , RAPISTS , RACKETEERES , LOBBYISTS , " against the FDA for failing to regulate the food additive monosodium glutamate  --  which Ferri claimed had nearly killed him on three occasions  --  and most of all against anyone connected with a failed Midwestern trailer-park deal in the early ' ' 80s . Ferri blamed his adviser in that venture  --  the firm of Pettit &; Martin  --  for alleged bad legal counsel . However , P &; M chairman Ted Russell said a partner from the company flew to Indianapolis to help Ferri find the local law firm that won him a $1 million settlement from other parties in the soured transaction . None of those killed appears to have played any part in the deal . But to someone with Ferri 's view of the world , that did n't seem to matter . " There is this condiscending attitude in business that when you get emotionally and mentally raped , well " you got screwed " and the accepted results is that the victim is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the rapist is admired and enveied as " a winner , ' ' " Ferri wrote . " I spent the last 13 years trying to find legal recourse and to get back on my feet , only to find a wall of silence and corruption from the legal community . " While police and the public mull over Ferri 's possible motives , survivors like Stephen Sposato face a more daunting task  --  somehow finding the grit to get on with their lives . It 's particularly tough , he says , with a baby who keeps looking around for the mommy who will never come home . " My married life to Jody was nothing but excellent . Those were the best five years of my life , " Sposato reminisces . " You ca n't even imagine ... " he trails off sadly . The day after the murders , sleepless at 3:30 a.m. , Sposato wrote a letter to President Clinton asking for tougher laws on semiautomatic weapons . He plans to work with a group Pettit &; Martin has formed to lobby on the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this . Why was n't this gun outlawed ? How many times must this happen until someone stops it ? " the grieving widower asks . " I 'd like to be able to look Megan in the eye and say , " Your mom died , but you should be proud to know it was n't in vain . ' ' " <p>
