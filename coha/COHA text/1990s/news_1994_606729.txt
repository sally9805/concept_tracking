<p> Ira Michael Heyman is used to jobs where the water just gets hotter , the issues more strident and sometimes prophetic , jobs where the challenge is satisfying warring parties who all believe they have a personal stake in his agenda . <p> After all , he was chancellor of that hotbed of hotheads , the University of California , Berkeley , for a decade . Looking back , it was a decade spent in an academic and social laboratory  --  10 years of running dialogue and wrenching decisions on issues ranging from budget cuts to student and faculty diversity . <p> He survived  --  flourished , even , raising record amounts of money while changing the face of the campus . So now he can say bluntly to whatever comes to his door , " I 'm used to this . " <p> He better be . Because Heyman 's experience at Berkeley is an uncanny preview of the issues he now faces as secretary of the Smithsonian Institution . The Smithsonian  --  a massive complex of 16 museums and research facilities , and even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its purpose ; is learning to live under a tight federal budget ; is facing intense scrutiny of its expansion plans and management ; and is struggling to broaden the participation of minorities and scientists on its staff and in its programs . <p> Heyman was invested as the 10th Smithsonian secretary yesterday morning , and after receiving a symbolic key to the Castle from Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist , he wasted no time getting to work . The job is tough and time is limited , he said . <p> Declaring that he was " fired with enthusiasm , " Heyman said the Smithsonian must seek deeper connections with corporations ; this will mean acknowledging more directly the sponsors of exhibits . Critics of such " commercialism "  --  as they call it  --  will have to accept it , he said . <p> He reached out to two key constituencies who have complained of neglect , saying the Smithsonian " will be paying special attention " to Hispanic culture and appointing a scientist , biologist Thomas Lovejoy  --  his main competitor for the secretary 's job  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues , such as biodiversity and endangered species . <p> Heyman signaled he will continue the belt-tightening that has rocked the Smithsonian for the past few years . " It is crucial that we sustain excellence in all that we do . If our resource base shrinks , we must be prepared to jettison the less important of our activities , " he said . At 64 , Heyman is expected to be a transition figure in the history of the institution ; this call to budgetary reality was his first charge . <p> The Smithsonian 's future , some argue , must be decided now because computer-fed innovations in the look and programming of museums and the marketing of knowledge are coming rapidly and audiences are changing . Fear abounds that the Smithsonian may become a follower , not a leader , in these areas . Heyman waded right into the leadership issue : " We should be more than the place to visit in Washington ; we should also be present throughout the country in a whole variety of ways . " <p> In his office one morning last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Smithsonian 's image , one that ca n't be fixed neatly for an empire of 6,000 employees , 26 million annual visitors and a budget of $ 458 million . <p> " I think image is going to be a big issue , " he said . " I think on one hand people in various arts communities view us as stodgy and old , an attic . Other people see us as avant-garde revisionists . I just have n't thought it all through yet . There are some real conundrums here about how to behave . " <p> Zestfully casual from head to toe , Heyman stands 6 feet 5  --  there seems to be an unspoken height requirement for modern secretaries  --  and has a shock of roving white hair . He avoids the Potomac Power Suit , preferring instead to wear his sleeves rolled up , his glasses hung around his neck , a deep maroon sweater vest and his trademark bow tie slightly askew . <p> Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt says he was attracted by Heyman 's sage factor . Two years ago , a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department . <p> " I was interested in adding a little gray hair and wisdom to my policy operation . We met for coffee at a hotel on a Sunday morning and after 30 minutes we had cut a deal . And we did n't talk about salary , job description , job title ; we forgot about that . We talked about history and politics , " said Babbitt . " In a world of hard-charging policy guys , he is the smartest guy in the room  --  but he is the one who is n't showing it . He is the one listening and picking up the points . " <p> Almost to a person , past colleagues describe Heyman as a listener . But after conferring with people , he often goes his own way . He once took on the crowd-pleasing ritual of college football bowl games , advocating their abolition at a meeting of the National Collegiate Athletic Association . " I got absolutely nowhere . I was really castigated , " he recalled . <p> When the Berkeley faculty asked him to discipline students who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he declined . And when the law school , where he had taught for more than 15 years , was charged with discriminatory hiring practices , Heyman stepped in and agreed that his old friends were foot-dragging . <p> Congress is tightening the Smithsonian 's purse strings : The federal appropriation for fiscal 1995 is expected to include no increase . The politicians are also looking more and more over the Smithsonian 's shoulder . House Speaker Thomas Foley ( D-Wash. ) recently assigned himself the vacant congressional seat on the institution 's board of regents . <p> Last week Sen. John Warner ( R-Va. ) , another regent , called Heyman and his predecessor Robert McC . Adams to his office to talk about the Enola Gay flap . ( The National Air and Space Museum is in the middle of a bruising debate with veterans groups over an exhibit looking at the 50th anniversary of the dropping of the first atomic bombs . ) In his remarks yesterday , Heyman showed he not only got the message , but knew how to deliver it . " Our first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bluntly . <p> But it 's clear Heyman enjoys a good laugh  --  often at his own expense , and sometimes it can backfire . " I made a number of wry comments , " he said about the Smithsonian 's Astrophysical Observatory , based in Cambridge , Mass . " And this is really the Berkeley chancellor talking  --  ' I do n't know why we are subsidizing the Harvard astronomy department . ' " The joke sent shivers through the unamused astronomers . To make up , he mentioned the observatory in yesterday 's remarks . <p> One of those loose comments has already irritated Sen. Ted Stevens ( R-Alaska ) , who has held the brown loafers of many a Smithsonian secretary to the fire . " I was told he said something about a colleague at the university , that went like : ' If he were in the federal bureaucracy , he 'd end up on Kodiak Island . ' " The senator found no humor in Alaska-bashing . " The jury is out " on Heyman , Stevens added . <p> " I think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a youth in New York City , he mixed academics and sports and landed at Dartmouth , followed by the Marine Corps during the Korean War and afterward Yale Law School . When he reached Yale , he was already married to Therese Thau Heyman . The couple scrimped pennies , like a lot of others . " We belonged to the ' brown bag ' club because we could n't afford the cafeteria , " recalls Sen. Arlen Specter ( R-Pa . ) . <p> When Heyman worked as a clerk for Earl Warren at the Supreme Court in 1958 , Therese Heyman worked at the Smithsonian . A graduate of Smith College and Yale , she directed the art department at the Oakland Museum for 30 years . Currently she 's on leave from that post and working at the Museum of American Art . The couple have a son , James , a physicist ; another son , Stephen , died two years ago from AIDS complications , a personal loss the family declines to discuss . <p> After 15 years of teaching , Heyman became vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The causes Berkeley students had protested for in the 1960s  --  more open enrollment , affirmative action , expanded curriculum  --  now had to be put into place . It was n't easy . Creating a more diverse campus , for example , divided the Asian American students , who claimed that admissions policies were discriminatory , from the white students , who claimed they were being discriminated against . <p> Similar rifts appeared in the faculty . Heyman sided with teachers of color and women who were seeking tenure , rather than the older senior professors who said things were moving too fast and standards were slipping . <p> Now Heyman faces similar battles at the Smithsonian , and he says he will make diversity a priority . " I think that we operate at our peril , and we operate not in a way the Smithsonian ought to operate , unless we reflect aptly the experiences and the art and the culture of our major constituent groups in the United States , " he said last week . He added that he supports plans for an African American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> And always there is the problem of money . " I ca n't be overly optimistic in this era of fiscal constraints , " he said . As a member of the Smithsonian 's National Board , a committee of private citizens who do some fund-raising , Heyman has been part of the push for more private support through the institution 's Fund for the Future . In 1993 , the fund raised $ 700,000 ; this year it has received $ 4.5 million in pledges . <p> Even so , Heyman says the cuts  --  229 positions so far  --  will continue under his leadership . " Absolutely . And this is ironic . I think if we do this intelligently ... it makes our quest for private resources more credible , " said Heyman , lifting his arms up and down in frustration at this quandary . <p> But then , Heyman is used to life without neat edges . <p> " Our house in Berkeley is 100 yards away from the Hayward Fault , and our cabin at Stinson Beach is 100 yards away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gruff laugh and a long pause . " You could say we live with a certain amount of uncertainty . "
