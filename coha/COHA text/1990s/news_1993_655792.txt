<p> SMACK in the middle of California 's Silicon Valley , computer legend Gordon Bell is on his living room floor , crouched over a bright red fire truck . <p> " Start the engines ! " he says , pressing a button on the toy . It whirs , engine-like , for a few seconds . He presses the button again and says : " Let 's move it now ! " The truck runs forward about two feet . <p> " An American company probably made the computer chip , " he says . But the truck was made in China . Every other electronic gadget in his living room is foreign-made too . " You ca n't even buy an American product , " the former Digital Equipment Corporation executive sighs . <p> That fire truck says a lot about America 's high-technology challenge . It 's not just Japanese electronics companies racing against the United States . It 's a new world where Chinese toymakers can use leading-edge technologies to turn out competitive products . Technology is not just spreading abroad , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between what is high-tech and what 's not . <p> Faced with this new world , the Clinton administration 's challenge is to define America 's place in it . It is a grand experiment : a nation of 250 million people trying to maintain the high-skill industries and keep the high-wage jobs that billions of other people are competing for . " Increasingly , what we can do , they can do , " says Intel chief executive Andrew Grove . " We 've got a big , big challenge ahead of us . " <p> Even if the administration did n't act , powerful currents of change are pushing the nation toward a new and as-yet ill-defined place in this high-tech order . President Clinton promises a firm hand on the tiller . No one knows how well he will be able to steer . <p> In his office outside Washington , D.C. , Dave Lehman pulls out a sheet of graph paper and draws a gently downward sloping line . " This is the analog world , " he says . " Sony and Panasonic are driving down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> He draws a second line that slopes down sharply , crossing the first . " This is the digital world , " he says . " The Apples and AT &Ts; are rapidly driving down this line . " US companies are nearing the intersection at which their new digital technology will be as cheap as Japan 's older analog technology . After that , Mr. Lehman warns , watch out ! The companies that build digital products will have the advantage . <p> " I am unabashedly American in this , " he adds . His own start-up company , TV Answer , hopes to manufacture digital products for interactive television . <p> Other high-tech executives are not so sanguine . After all , Japan and Europe are building more digital products too . But the technological shift is allowing the US to get back into the race . Economics may help . With the value of the dollar at record lows against the Japanese yen , US products are more competitively priced . " We may , with the yen-to-dollar situation , have a slight edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer of Zilog Inc. , a small chipmaker in Campbell , Calif . " But I think it would become very easy to become complacent and lose it again . " <p> US policy is undergoing a sea change . The cold war - the underlying rationale for 45 years of federal research and development - has given way to an era of defense cuts . The US can take a tougher stance on trade issues with allies . Mr. Clinton can also shift federal R &D; resources from defense to civilian projects ( national labs and other agencies cooperate with industry , Page 10 ) . <p> There is plenty of skepticism about current R &D; policies . <p> Last August , a National Science Board study concluded that the nation 's civilian R &D; spending has grown at a slower pace than that of major competitors and that important areas of research , such as process technology , were falling between the cracks . States , as well as the federal government , are trying to address these issues ( state technology policies , Page 10 ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration has launched a policy emphasizing : 1 ) environmental technology , especially a more benign automobile 2 ) a high-speed computer and communications infrastructure ( so-called " information superhighways , " 3 ) technology transfer from federal labs to factory floors , 4 ) modest increases in tax breaks for business investment , 5 ) modernizing federal agencies through technology and 6 ) more funds for basic research at universities . <p> " The good news is we know what needs to be done , " says Vice President Al Gore Jr . " We know how to do it ... And we have established models to help us avoid mistakes . So for all these reasons I think there is cause for tremendous optimism for the beginning of a new era of US competitiveness in all of these fields . " <p> In fact , the US has fairly few established models to rely on for government-industry joint ventures . So , while high-tech leadersgenerally support the more tried-and-true aspects of the Clinton program , they are more skeptical about its experimental components . <p> Some high-tech industries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for government support only in trade and tax issues . <p> Others decry the government 's contradictory policies . The White House 's 1994 budget targets biotechnology as one of several critical areas for federal support . But the president also wants to stem drug-price increases as part of his health-care reforms , a move the industry says would slow innovation . <p> Yet many executives are willing to have government experiment . <p> " We need greater alignment among industry , government , educational institutions , and labor than ever before , " says Motorola chairman George Fisher . <p> When Clinton and Mr. Gore talk about improving the nation 's information infrastructure just about everyone applauds . " We think that kind of leadership at the administration level can bring that vision to the fore , " says AT &T; chairman Robert Allen . <p> It 's when the administration proposes to move government closer to the marketplace that debate sharpens . <p> Buried within the bowels of the Defense Department is the tiny Advanced Research Projects Agency . ARPA funds experimental technologies that it considers vital to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T. J. Rodgers , the outspoken boss of a Silicon Valley chipmaker , set out to expose federal high-tech boondoggles , the agency was one of his targets . The conservative Mr. Rodgers ( his office sports a poster of former President Reagan ) was surprised at what he found . Instead of waste and inefficiency , he found technical expertise . Instead of pork-barrel projects , he found a tiny agency with worthy projects and tremendous support from venture capitalists . <p> " You can sum it up in one sentence : small science , " Rodgers says . He crossed DARPA - as it was then known - off his list of government boondoggles . ( Clinton recently dropped the word " Defense " from the agency title , making it ARPA . ) <p> Why is ARPA so successful ? Observers say it is well-managed , technically expert , out of the limelight , and small . With a budget mostly free of political wrangling , the agency has effectively promoted critical new technologies that companies had n't dared to fund . <p> Thus , ARPA belies the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In technology , we are already making choices , " says Dan Burton , executive vice president of the private-sector Council on Competitiveness . " So let 's just review our priorities . " <p> What 's unknown is whether such small-time experiments will work in the big time . Complaints have cropped up around one of the agency 's successes : massively parallel processing or MPP computers . The General Accounting Office is expected to release a report soon that , while not finding any wrongdoing , criticizes ARPA for promoting some MPP computers over others . <p> " The government has had a very significant role in stimulating the development of the technology and putting a halo of correctness around massive parallelism , " says Jeff Kalb , president of MasPar Computer . But " if the government continues to support machines after you are past the research phase , then the best ideas do n't necessarily win out - just the ones that get subsidized . " His company did not get federal aid . <p> The criticism has caused ARPA to clean up its act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portent of things to come . <p> As Washington pours in more dollars and encourages more commercial activities , the stakes surrounding federal high-tech will go up . Companies will lobby harder and complain louder when their machines are n't picked . Will congressmen resist the temptation to lobby for home-district companies ? And perhaps a bigger question : When does the government pull out of a project to commercialize a technology ? The line between the research phase and the market phase is awfully hazy . <p> " Yes , there 's a great risk of pork , " adds Bennett Harrison , political economy professor at Carnegie Mellon University . " And it 's worth the risk .
