Houston , you have a problem . The Astrodome , which was proclaimed the Eighth Wonder of the World when it opened 31 years ago , did not turn out to be another Hanging Gardens of Babylon . Or even an ivied walls of Wrigley . The future of the once futuristic playground will hang in the balance on Nov. 5 when citizens of Harris County vote on a proposed $265 million retractable-roof baseball stadium . The Astrodome , formerly a symbol of progress and a source of pride for Houstonians , may now be renounced by the citizenry that once acclaimed it . // An Astrodome contemporary , Atlanta- Fulton County Stadium , will be a goner soon after the World Series . It was considered a paradise by the Braves when they abandoned Milwaukee following the 1965 season to take up residence in Atlanta , but it will be razed in the off-season , its site to become a parking lot for the adjacent Olympic Stadium  --  soon to be Ted Turner Field . The replacement of old and not-so-old stadiums is either under way or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // Those stadiums were hailed as marvels when they opened , in most cases barely more than a generation ago . Many came out of the cookie-cutter school of architecture  --  Busch Stadium in St. Louis , Riverfront Stadium in Cincinnati , Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh and Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia  --  massive circular arenas built to hold 55,000 fans and house both baseball and football teams . At the time this made perfect economic and engineering sense . They were designed in an era when fans went to games and not " entertainment experiences , " when no one was unduly fussy . The stadiums had to have enough seats to anticipate the demand of growing baby boomers , one stadium surely was cheaper to build than two , and artificial turf was going to make these sporting palaces even more efficient . Like shag carpets and that sickly avocado color that was all the rage for kitchen appliances , they seemed like good ideas at the time . Now plastic grass is the curse of sore-jointed athletes , every team wants a single-use stadium , and baseball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . Those 1960s parks have turned out to be the structural equivalent of the Nehru jacket . // Now we 're in the era of economy-sized stadiums , 42,000-seat faux-antique ballparks from the Iowa-cornfield school of architecture , where premium seats are cushioned for the comfort of those with premium seats . Baltimore 's Camden Yards , Cleveland 's Jacobs Field , Denver 's Coors Field and the other ball yards replete with calculated kitsch have elicited the same awe as the Eighth Wonder once did . They are now as conventionally wise as Riverfront and Three Rivers were 25 years ago , magic beans that will turn revenue streams into waterfalls and dead downtowns into Disneylands  --  if you can look beyond the public debt . Bill them ( the taxpayers ) , and they will come . On one level the optimism is impressive . Detroit hopes its new ballpark will revive downtown in a way that a monorail and a shining complex of buildings called the Renaissance Center , both erected in the past 20 years , have failed to do . The Montreal Expos lust for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domed Olympic Stadium 12 minutes east of centre ville , as if a stadium alone will swell attendance in a city where baseball apathy runs deep and the owners ' pockets run shallow . // But lurking beneath this Iowa-cornfield building boom is an assumption that also is profoundly pessimistic : Baseball is n't coming back . The game has become as dated as the avocado Hotpoint , and you do not need 55,000 seats when 40,000 will be plenty . Intimacy in a ballpark has its virtues , of course . If you are an owner , small stadiums reduce the number of distant ( read : cheap ) seats and create an artificial scarcity , lending a sense of urgency to ticket buying . But if owners and politicians figured the game was going to regain its grip on the fans ' souls , surely one of them would tell HOK Sports Facilities Group , the company that came up with the designs for Camden Yards and Coors Field , to cut the confectionery and put in another 10,000 seats  --  even cheap ones . // Houstonians will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the electorate refuses to pay for a retractable-roof stadium , the Astros will surely beat it to a city that will build them some sort of new park . But taxpayers beware : Do n't assume that an investment of hundreds of millions is going to last your lifetime , let alone your children 's lifetimes . The flavors of the decade change . Architectural revisionism rules . Lisa Marie and Michael 's till-death-do-us-part lasted 20 months , the thousand-year Reich could n't make a quarter of a century , and as Houstonians know , the Dome , old before its time , might not see the millennium . The Eighth Wonder was no Pyramids scheme .
