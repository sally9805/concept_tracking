He thinks about the water often : sitting in traffic ; in a chair in his office ; in bed with his wife , Jeanette , who is now asleep . Together they live the life of the city , Phoenix , where the smog blisters the horizon and the swimming pools are treated by experts . Byron , his brother-in-law , runs a pool cleaning business . Byron drives from home to home in his sky blue pickup truck , Byron 's Pool Service , measuring the pH , the need for chlorine and acid treatments . He has recently hired two graduates from Tempe , has bought each a truck and supplies ; next year , he 'll be hiring another , business is swell . The college graduates are tan , and one of them , the blond , deals cocaine . <p> " It 's a great job for a kid , " Byron said , earlier this afternoon in the driveway . He stood in the sun , his long arms resting on the roof of his truck . " You drive around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , get a tan . And get laid by all those lonesome housewives . " <p> " That 's a myth , " Tom said . <p> " Myth , my ass . Just ask old snowhead next time he comes by . Ask him if he 's getting any . " ' <p> " Drug dealers , " Tom said . " It 's not the same . " <p> " Kids , " Byron said . " Kids . You ask Jeanette sometime . Sometime when you 're feeling lonesome . Kids these days  --  they 're like bunnies . Like bunnies and monkeys , " he said , wagging his finger . " I 'll give ' em this , though . You ca n't call ' em lazy . They just ai n't lazy . " <p> " It 's the nature of the drug , " Tom said , and he knows Byron thinks he 's lazy . All accountants , according to Byron , are lazy . Ever since the calculator . Byron resents him his wife , Byron 's sister . At thirty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and now , while she sleeps beside him , while he watches the clock , the luminous patterns which read 3:37 , he thinks about Jeanette sitting outside in the sun , drinking her iced tea , reading a book , and watching the pool man . The pool man is just a kid skimming orange blossoms across the surface of the water  --  the pole in his hand a sword . A foil , he thinks . The kind you have to point with to do any real damage . <p> Since the advent of the repeating rifle , nicotine , like other drugs , has become decreasingly popular . When he smoked , he would handle his cigarette like a pointer  --  a hot , burning tip , punctuating the rhythm of his sentences and ideas . And while he still carries his cigarettes , he no longer smokes them . Not for three months . To celebrate the event , March 17 , he picked Jeanette up at the library and drove to the airport . There they caught the first flight leaving for St. Louis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whenever he felt the urge , the first shivers of nicotine withdrawal , he would put a cigarette in front of him . He would focus on the cigarette until the shiver passed and he began to think about something else . If he could think about something else , then he did n't want a cigarette . Even at dinner , over his coffee , which he kept , and his Scotch , which he also kept  --  even then he would reach into his pocket and remove a cigarette , and set it before him , standing end-up . Increasingly , he became less conversational and more stoic . " No one , " he would argue , " wants to be an addict . You name me one who does . A drunk , a junkie  --  a Twinkie nut . I do n't care what he 's using , no one wants to be an addict , " and then he would stop talking , focus on his cigarette , a monument of self-discipline , and feel stronger about himself than ever before . " Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and by now he knew that he was beyond the danger of addiction , that addiction was something you need not be afraid of if you face up to it . He was smart enough to know he did n't want just one . <p> This is what he thought about on the plane , as he sat in non-smoking , a window seat where he sat holding his wife 's hand . He had smoked a particular brand of cigarettes , one which advertised cowboys and wild horses ; Jeanette told him for the first time in years he smelled really nice . Once in St. Louis , they rented a car , found a motel near the airport and bought a bottle of Jameson 's . It was , after all , St. Paddy 's . They drank whiskey from plastic cups and watched television until he passed out . In the early morning , he woke to find Jeanette sitting on a vinyl chair , staring out the window . She sat watching the lights and the planes land , which he pictured as he closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling into his mind  --  the edges blurred by the light on their wings . <p> " They 're so pretty , " she might have said . <p> In the morning , dressed , she did say , " I want to see the arch . " <p> " I do n't want a cigarette . " <p> " Yes you do . " <p> " You 're right , " he said , flexing , reaching for the Tylenol . " I want to see the arch . " <p> She had of course been raised in St. Louis . " When I was a kid , " she told him , " they were building the thing . To celebrate Jefferson . The Louisiana Purchase . They kept building it , and every weekend we 'd drive downtown to watch the progress . And then Dad got a job in Detroit , and we moved . They still had n't connected the top  --  it was n't complete . I want to see it complete , " she said , and he had promised someday they would , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something he was remembering : their vacation , on Oahu , the place of his birth . They had married in Phoenix and flown across the ocean and for two weeks set themselves up in a condo which belonged to friends of his parents . Normally , the friends got three grand a month for it , but his parents knew people , it was a small island , and it was then , while treading water in the Pacific , that she told him about St. Louis , and the arch she never saw . complete , and the way when you looked up at the arch it always looked the same . What was different , she explained , was the sky , and he felt himself drifting on the water , wondering what it would be like if the sky never changed , if only the things below it changed , like trees . Like plants and all those people who planted them and all this water . <p> Because he can not sleep , and because he does not want to think about not sleeping , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and walks through the dark halls of his house ; in the kitchen , he reaches under the sink , where he knows there is a half-bottle of gin , a gallon of Chablis , and a full liter of Scotch . He bought the Scotch last weekend and it is still in its bag . He bought it at a liquor store downtown , off Van Buren , the type that caters to the hookers and johns  --  cheap beer , soda-pop wine . The whiskey bottles were covered with dust , behind the counter , where a man sat watching a television . Beneath the counter Tom knew the man had a gun , it was that kind of place , and the bottle is still dusty . He rinses it under the tap and locates a glass , his whiskey glass , the one with a picture of the Howard Coleman Library stenciled onto the surface . Once before , when he used to worry about Jeanette worrying about his drinking , he had tried to quit : he had tried to face it the way he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a glass of beer , or Scotch , and set it down in front of him and stare at it . But while he stared at the glass , he would want what it held , and so he would drink it  --  smoothly and in one pleasant , lingering rush . Addiction , he reasoned , was n't addiction when you wanted it . It was need . <p> In the mornings , Jeanette always took a swim . " You 've got a problem , " she might tell him someday , shaking the water from her hair . Maybe reaching for the towel . <p> " Really ? " <p> Of course it 's all in the blood : a treasure to be passed down the genetic line , like blue eyes or hemophilia . In your weakest moments , something to be proud of . Usually , it begins at the elbows , a sudden , nervous little twitch near the joints , really , on the inside  --  the tender part . From there it spreads equally up the biceps while the fingers grow nervous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , begins to send signals elsewhere : the gut , the ankles  --  the hamstrings , even , which tighten up as if being choked : the way you lock in a drill bit , by choking it . By now the brain is foggy , its logic unpredictable , caught in the undertow of need . What once seemed clear is now less so . Your sentences become confused , post hoc , and what you 're thinking is what , simply , is going to stop you from going through this one more time now ? <p> A swallow , you think . Just enough to swallow yourself full . <p> After clarity comes love . Sweet , feckless love . Eventually the flesh begins to soften , around the eyes at first , and then the mouth , into , the neck and arms and flanks until , one morning over coffee and juice , you realize the flesh you have is not necessarily the flesh you want . Last Christmas in Hawaii , with his parents and Jeanette , and Byron , who 'd wanted to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over there ? "  --  there they shared a room with Byron , there one night , in bed , Tom had wanted his wife , Jeanette , and she had said , " No , Tom . Byron . " <p> " So ? " <p> " So wait , " she said , sleepily . " Wait until morning . " <p> And after a while he had fallen asleep . In the morning , he walked on the beach in a T-shirt . Byron slept in and woke late to fix eggs . Jeanette went shopping with his mother for a swimsuit in Waikiki , and his father changed the oil in their rental car . But on the beach , in his T-shirt , while walking along the white sand , he came across a couple . The boy was in a wetsuit , and the girl , a young girl with short blond hair , lay on her back , the top of her bikini curled loosely in her fist . She lay on her back and smiled up at Tom , as if to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to watch out , this was a public beach , the cops patrolled it with helicopters , but instead Tom had looked at the boy , his skin swollen with fine , perfect health , and of course at the girl , and then Tom had walked on . He could feel the boy 's eyes , following him , and he thought never again would a woman look at him the way he had wanted to look at her  --  in sweet , gentle admiration . He thought about Jeanette , telling him to wait . To wait until morning . <p> " You know what I think ? " Byron said later . They were sitting on the porch , drinking beer , watching the birds inside his father 's pigeon coop . The coop had burned down once years ago . Neighbors said you could see them flaming , the birds , flaming as they tried to beat out the fire . Some of them escaped into the sky . <p> " No . What ? " Tom said . <p> " I think if a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let her screw around , too . " <p> " You 've never been married . " <p> " I think if a man screws around on his wife , it better be worthwhile . I 've seen plenty of those housewives , let me tell you . They sit out there by the pool , wagging their tails . Loyal as goddamn pups , bud , Pups ! " <p> " Never , " Tom said . " I 've never cheated on Jeanette . " <p> " Meaning ? Meaning what , bud ? " <p> " Meaning , why are we talking about this ? " <p> Just then Tom 's father came through the gate , holding a fan belt in his hands , the knuckles of his right hand bloody and skinned . He stumbled through the gate , reached into the cooler for two beers , and stepped slowly into the house . <p> " If you ask me , " Byron said , pointing to Tom 's father , " I think you better start keeping an eye on your wife . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father had enjoyed the study of our American heritage and raised homing pigeons . Once , his father sneaked a dove on a plane and flew to the Big Island . There , he let the bird go , and by the time he flew back on a plane , finding his car in the parking lot , driving over the Puli , and arriving home late for supper , there she was , sitting on the coop , roosting . His father would tell the story often . <p> But now outside on his driveway , under the floodlights , it 's time for glory . The basketball is dense , in need of air , and after pumping the ball , filling the yellow-orange ball full of air , he 's ready to go . The ball in one hand , the drink in another , Tom forces the net , lofting the ball . After the ball goes in , as planned , he turns to face the crowd which he ca n't see for all the floodlights . Still , he hears it , and he knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely wife , Jeanette . <p> " I had a good coach , " he 's telling the crowd . " The finest coach in college basketball today , Gene Tummings . " He turns to the crowd and waves , sipping from his drink . " Gene , " he says , nodding . " Gene , you taught me everything I know . " <p> His next shot from the free-throw line sails onto the roof ; he can hear the ball rolling across the length of the house , and what Gene Tummings taught him , specifically , was how to run suicide sprints . Running those sprints had taught Tom how to measure his endurance , how to break through the barrier of pain into the promise of a second wind . Once into the second wind , that wind which emerged from all of this pain , he was invincible . And Jeanette would watch him from the bleachers , running his sprints , and he would be oblivious , running . <p> " My wife , " he tells the crowd , smiling , pointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vision . " <p> Now , setting down his drink on the free-throw line , he looks down the length of the driveway . The mailbox is a hundred yards , easy . As easy as making a dash , which he does , but along the way he stumbles , sliding onto his belly into a cholla . When he rises from the pavement , he understands that his arm and cheek are full of needles . His belly is going to raspberry , and he ca n't feel a thing . <p> " Wait , " Jeanette said in bed , with Byron just four feet away . " Wait until morning . " <p> Meaning , Tom thinks , that she knew in the morning Byron would be too caught up in his sleep to notice . Meaning , Tom thinks , that this is the voice of experience . And what he wants to know , here and now , standing in the doorway of their bedroom , watching his wife sleep  --  what he wants to know is where she learned to wait . Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to swim naked alone . And naturally Tom had not wanted to wait , and Jeanette had slid under the blanket , receiving him with considered affection . There , she labored under the blanket , and what he thought about , with Byron next door  --  next bed , actually  --  what he thought about was what she must look like , there beneath the blanket in the same room with her brother and her lover and all this experience . What he thought about was what this meant , this waiting for morning , which she might as well have done . And later , after Jeanette would rise from the covers , spooning him , later the next morning while Jeanette went into Waikiki looking for a new swimsuit , he would know that she was not going to talk about this . He knew she was going to tuck it into the back of her mind , quietly , the same way she had tucked him into her mouth , waiting for him to either come or fall asleep . <p> Whence comes this experience ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the borders of his driveway . In the bathroom , with Jeanette 's tweezers , he plucks them from his skin . The needles are barbed and he is careful not to break them , but even so they break , still under his skin , his hands large and uncooperative . The roots of these needles will remain lodged in his skin until they begin to fester ; he will need to dab at the roots with turpentine , or nail polish , he ca n't remember which . On the beach , when you ran into a man-of-war , the most immediate cure was urea . You 'd ask a friend to piss on you , and now , after he takes a leak , he rubs at the blisters along his arm and face . Eventually , he rubs his hand along the skin of his belly and picks out the small pieces of gravel ; sooner or hater , things are going to start beginning to hurt . Meanwhile , he stands here , in the doorway , watching his lovely wife sleep . <p> Wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If Gene Tummings had been his father , instead of his coach , Tom might have become someone else , and vice versa . Because he can not sleep , Jeanette must be sleeping with someone else . Tomorrow , things are going to hurt like hell . <p> But he 's sensible enough to know there 's a way to put that off ; he ca n't remember where he 's put the basketball . The whiskey is on the kitchen table , where it belongs , and he grabs the bottle and glass and returns through the garage to his driveway . Because he cart trace the first , faint stirrings of dawn , he decides to turn the floodlights off . The switch is located behind a rake , a three-foot-wide rake he uses Sunday mornings to groom the granite lawn , and when he reaches for the switch , the handle of the rake falls forward , striking him in the face . Pissed , he takes the rake and huffs it across the garage . The rake bounces off the wall , landing on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station wagon . A family car with an enormous engine just beneath the painted hood . In the morning , he will have to check the paint for damage . Above him , propped on the beams of his garage , rests his stepladder . <p> After he thinks about the basketball long enough , maybe he 'll remember where he 's put it . <p> Love is for the timid and the damned . In Phoenix , the water becomes necessary , the whiskey supplies him with regret . What if he had reason to be someone else ? His wife , he tells himself , is sleeping with someone else , and his father never taught him how to dribble properly . This much is clear , the ladder is unsteady , and as he ascends , bottle in hand , he knows what he is doing . He is climbing onto the roof of his house . Once there , he realizes the need for furniture . He descends , removes a lawn chair from the porch , and returns to the ladder , climbing once again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swings with him , disrupting his balance and spinning him full circle  --  the chair striking the ladder , the ladder falling slowly . When the ladder finally hits the ground , there is a loud , awkward noise , leaving Tom alone on his roof to consider recent events . Simply put , the ladder has fallen to the ground , and the tar paper is sticky with grit ; his father never meant a thing to Gene Tummings ; perhaps basketball could have been a way of life . He unfolds the chair by the air-conditioning unit and leans back into it . After a while , he recognizes the basketball , across the roof , sitting in a puddle of stale water over their bedroom . Jeanette could possibly be sleeping with the pool boy , or maybe someone else he does n't know . Usually she waits until morning when it is safe . Any minute , he thinks , looking into the sky . Any minute now and the sun is going to break . <p> In St. Louis , there on the lawn beneath the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never had he seen anything so impossibly big . The ocean was big , but not as big as the sky . The arch stretched across the sky , and looking up at it , he realized he was no. longer looking up at anything . Rather , he was looking down at something larger than himself and his wife combined  --  the promise of good fortune , a homestead . Land for the taking and enough space for a man to milk his cow in . Clearly the possibilities were enormous . <p> " It 's so big , " Jeanette said . " It 's bigger than I remembered . " <p> The air was brisk , washing over the arch and the shape it described . They stood on a large , dead lawn , and Jeanette shivered inside her coat . <p> " A veritable wonder of the world , " he said , taking her arm . " Let 's go inside . " <p> Inside , underground , with the lawn overhead , and the sky above that , they talked to a woman about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riverboat rides . The woman asked if they were on their honeymoon . <p> " No . " <p> " You 're so young . And pretty , " she said . " You really should go up inside . You can see the whole city ! " <p> Tom wondered if the woman had ever been on a honeymoon ; he felt like a tourist , and realized that he was . A visitor in a foreign land . The Louisiana Purchase , which Tom knew Jefferson had been allowed to buy because Napoleon had got his ass kicked in Santo Domingo . Napoleon was on another continent , no longer a threat . His navy was locked in ice . A long time ago , before he began training doves , Tom 's father had undertaken a correspondence course entitled Our American Heritage . His father had often encouraged Tom , to learn from the past and to help him study . <p> Waiting in line , Tom thought about his father , and cigarettes , his head racing while Jeanette read to him from the brochures . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom pretended not to listen . Growing up in Oahu , Tom had learned to hate the tourists . He watched a family from Arkansas , or Missouri , standing before them : three overfed children shoving each other , sucking on their Cokes , their parents standing stiffly , equally overfed and uncomfortable . He wondered what type of car it was that they might drive . <p> " So why ? " Jeanette said . <p> " Why what ? " <p> " Why now  --  ' 68 . Why build the thing now ? " <p> In 1968 , Tom was watching television and learning to surf . His father was in another detox unit on the mainland , someplace near Portland , and Tom was made responsible for taking care of the birds ; his mother was afraid of lice and she wanted to go back to school . She wanted to protest the Vietnam War , expand her horizons . For the very first time , Tom realized that maybe she wanted to leave him . <p> " It 's a symbol , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it is . " <p> Tom watched a man standing by an ashtray across the room light up . The man took a drag from his cigarette and , exhaling , blew the smoke away and up into the ceiling . <p> " You know , " Jeanette said , taking his arm and kissing him , briefly , on the neck , " I 'm so proud of you . " <p> " Just do n't leave me , " he said . " Promise . " <p> If he had n't played basketball in college , taught himself to slam-dunk , Jeanette might have never fallen in love with him . He holds the basketball on his lap , watching the sun rise , thinking the basketball is round and in about the same shape as the world . If it were n't for gravity , he 'd keep slipping off , and when he holds the ball up to his finger , he thinks maybe he can still make it spin . He can make the ball spin and balance on the point of his finger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball a spin , it does n't stay in place . He takes another drink , reaching instinctively for a cigarette . He has a pack of cigarettes in his toolbox , on the shelf over the washer-dryer , but even now , were he there , standing in front of the washing machine and looking at his cigarettes , even now he knows he would n't smoke one . He has too great a discipline ; smoke is a matter of the will . Jeanette , who 's sleeping with someone else , is proud of him . The sun is filling up the space on his roof , and now , when he spins the basketball on the tip of his finger , the ball remains : facing him , spinning , turning him giddy with relief . He still has n't lost his touch . <p> Before his father returned home from the mainland , Tom slipped outside . It was night , and late , and still very warm . He slipped into the backyard in his shorts , all white and lit up by the Hawaiian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straw . Then he took a match and set the birds aflame . To this day , it remains secret , this source of unexpected fire in his childhood backyard . His father came home later , sober , and wept for days . Sometimes Tom wishes he could tell someone . Sometimes , when he can not sleep , he stays up thinking about other things he 's Clone . Maybe Jeanette wants to tell him what she 's done ? <p> Because when he can not sleep , she must be sleeping with someone else . Wait , she said . Wait until morning . In the morning , they rode up through the tunnel of the arch with the family from Kentucky . The family was n't from Arkansas or Missouri , after all . The family talked nervously in the small space of their car , and Tom had to duck to keep from bumping his head against the low ceiling . He sat silently as the family talked on and the car shifted , corresponding to the angle of their ascent , keeping them level . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida ; they 'd been planning the trip for years , since the birth of Jimmy Roy , who was too young yet to come along . Jimmy Roy was at home with the in-laws , and back in Phoenix , Byron was taking care of Tom and Jeanette 's pool . <p> Jeanette was smiling at the couple , being polite . " I grew up here , " she was saying . " But I 've never really seen it . " <p> " That 's a shame " said the woman . " That 's a real pretty shame . " <p> Briefly , the man reminded Tom of his father . They had the same faces , and Tom realized the man was a drunk . You could see it in his eyes , and he wondered if the woman knew . He wondered if she 'd leave him if she knew . <p> Once at the top , they followed a narrow metal stairway leading to the center of the arch : the observation room . It was the last section to be installed , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now they were here , all together , standing in its center  --  an integral part of the construction and design . The metal floor was carpeted , and they could feel the wind buffeting the walls of the arch . The floor was unsteady and they found themselves leaning uncertainly against a window , looking out over the western frontier , industrialized and full of smoke . They leaned into the view and rested the weight of their bodies against the vibrating monument . <p> " What I said , " Tom said . " Down there . That 's not what I meant . " <p> " Tom , " said Jeanette , " I 'm not going to leave you . " <p> " What I meant was , if you want to leave me , then I want you to . I mean I want you to do what you want . " <p> " I love you . " <p> And standing there , leaning against the window , he knew it was going to be dangerous . Here , where there were no longer any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future and all the wrong ways you could turn , wandering through that space reserved especially for you while you went looking for a river , hoping the water clean . Avoiding disease . It was a place , finally , you had to travel into alone , West , where the land was big enough for a man to get drunk for a living . If you kept living long enough , the land eventually turned to water . The history you knew you were going to have to go through  --  even without a lover , or a wife , it was enough to keep a man up at night . <p> " I feel like I 'm falling , " he had said . " I feel like I 'm falling and I do n't know where I 'm going to land . " <p> " It 's so pretty , " she said , taking his hand . " It really is pretty , is n't it ? " <p> Basketball is a team sport , five men on the court ; today , a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you may as well be without a team , which you always are . Alone and on the court , who is there left to judge. ? By seven , though he does n't know what time it is , he knows he 's in control . He knows things are right and going to be okay . Okay , he tells himself . Everything 's going to be okay . <p> From the roof he sees Jeanette opening the sliding glass door of their bedroom . She is walking through the doorway carrying a pink towel , preparing to take her morning swim . Each morning , she does this even before brushing her teeth ; something more than merely habit , he thinks . The way things wake you up like that . Jeanette is walking over the deck , up to the ledge of their pool . <p> Tom stands and says , " Morning . " <p> " Tom ? " <p> " Nice view , from up here . " <p> " You scared me ! What are you doing ? " <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Best to wait until morning , so that 's what I 'm doing . And watching , of course . " <p> " Come down , " she says . " Come on down from there . " <p> " You 're beautiful , " he says , and looking at his wife by the pool , he ' . feels an unexpected relief . She loves him . Some people just do n't know any better , and looking at her here in the still early dawn , everything is inexplicably clear . He is a man , standing over the roof of his house , looking at his wife and the pool they have built together . The pool is blue as the sky and full of clean water , and he wonders why he never thought of doing this before . He holds the ball up and lofts it into the pool , where it lands dead center , waiting to be recovered . <p> " Watch , " he says ; removing his shorts . Afterwards , he stands almost perfectly still , eyeing the distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arms . " The ladder , Tom . Wait . " <p> " Watch , " he says , and looking at the water below , he knows there 's no going back . There 's only going gracefully and following through . <p> " Tom ! " <p> " No , wait , " he says . " This 'll be good . " <p> <p> By T. M. MCNALLY <p> T. M.
