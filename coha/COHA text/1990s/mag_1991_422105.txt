<p> Under the rubric of conservation biology  --  an academic discipline that did n't exist two decades ago  --  activists are working to avoid the storm of estinctions predicted for the 21st century . <p> Free the Lobo ! " <p> A petition bearing this slogan recently circulated through the biology department at the University of New Mexico , gathering signatures with case . Supported by the Mexican Wolf Coalition and the Wolf Action Group , its aim was to introduce Mexican gray wolves bred in captivity to parts of their historic range in New Mexico and Arizona . <p> After some reflection , James Brown , a biologist best known for his landmark study of mammal extinctions in the Great Basin , decided not to sign . " I 'm all for the lobo . " Brown explains . " But there are only 39 adults left . Their former habitat is so fragmented that reestablishing a viable population may not be possible . I 'm just not sure there 's a place for the wolf in the Southwest anymore . <p> This statement  --  which in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to imprisonment in zoos  --  is considered heresy by many local consevationists , who argue that parts of the Southwest are still big and wild enough to support wolves . But many of those who disagree with Brown about the lobo share his larger concerns about the progressive degradation of wildlife habitat in this country . In symposia and scientific journals , in Sierra Club and gun  --  club meetings , the traditional approach to wildlife conservation is being reevaluated  --  and found wanting . <p> " Our emphasis on saving critically endangered species , " says conservation biologist Blair Csuti , " has too frequently resulted in crisis management for individual plants and animals . " <p> Although Csuti does n't advocate making an omelet out of the next clutch of California condor eggs , he is one of many scientists who believe that the U.S. Endangered Species Act , which focuses on life forms on the brink of extinction , must be broadened to include endangered habitats and ecosystems . The logic is simple and pragmatic : Last-ditch efforts to resuscitate a vanishing plant or animal are heroic but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common , before most of its habitat has been destroyed . <p> Conservationists are quick to defend the Endangered Species Act ; in the nearly 20 years since its passage it has been one of their most powerful tools . The act has been instrumental in protecting the northern spotted owl and portions of the Northwest 's ancient forests , for example , and has restored to healthy numbers once-faltering species such as the bald eagle , peregrine falcon , and American alligator . Despite these successes , however , the loss of wildlife habitat continues . <p> " We 've been winning a few battles , but losing the war , " admits biologist and Sierra Club staffer Gene Coan . " It 's time to broaden the focus . " <p> For biologists and conservationists , " broadening the focus " is a recurring theme . There is ; they say , an urgent need to change the mindset underlying our current approach to wildlife conservation . We need to shift the emphasi from next year to next century , continuing to build lifeboats for critically endangered species , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ark . <p> " Over the past century , we 've managed to preserve many parks and wilderness areas , but they were selected largely on the basis of their scenic and recreational importance , " says John Hopkins , chair of the Sierra Club 's Public Lands Committee . " Now activists must turn to the enormous challenge of preserving lands of biological significance . " <p> The push to revise current conservation strategies stems in part from the forecast for the next century : The world 's population will continue to mount by 250,000 each day . Our forests will be cut down , and then global warming will kick in . Rainfall patterns will shift . Crops will fail . Governments will dither as billions starve , dragging millions of species down with them . Today the Sahel ; tomorrow Brazil , Mexico , Kenya . <p> The scenario is too grim to sugarcoat . The Era of Life 's Impoverishment , ecologist Norman Myers calls it . Michael Soule of the University of California at Santa Cruz dedicated his 1986 book , Conservation Biology , " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worst , and accomplish the most . " <p> If current trends continue , according to a recent report to the National Science Foundation , " the rate of extinction over the next few decades is likely to rise to at least 1,000 times the normal background rate ... and will ultimately result in the loss of a quarter or more of the species on earth . " <p> Although the loss of biological diversity will be greatest in the tropics , where most of the planet 's animal and plant species reside , our continent will not be spared . Indeed , ongoing habitat destruction makes the loss of thousands of North American species a certainty  --  unless we fundamentally change the way we use the land . <p> Biodiversity is a thorny term , I most commonly associated with rainforest preservation . Asked to define it , an ecologist will usually say , " It 's more than species " before diving into a thicket of complexities . To explore the different layers and levels of biodiversity , I did a little bushwhacking with conservation biologist Larry Harris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1984 ) , a blueprint for preserving biodiversity in the heavily logged forests of Oregon . <p> There are three levels , he explained The first , " genetic diversity , " refers to genes within species . A century ago , biologist C. Hart Merriam identified dozens of populations of grizzly bears : the well-known Plains grizzly for one , but also distinct grizzly populations in California , Arizona , Texas , Oregon , and elsewhere . Today all these animals are gone . " Some people will tell you that we really did n't lose anything , because we still have grizzlies in Yellowstone , " said Harris , now at the University of Florida . " Nonsense . We lost a lot . " <p> What we lost was genetic information , the DNA coding that enables organisms to cope with change . The bears that vanished were all the same species , but because they had adapted to different environments they were n't all the same . Genetic diversity can also be lost through habitat fragmentation and subsequent inbreeding among a stranded population . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and why even captive breeding may be too little , too late to save the Florida panther . <p> " Species diversity " refers to the variety of species within a habitat or broader area . One place rich in this respect is the 502-square-mile Gray Ranch in southwestern New Mexico . Recently purchased by The Nature Conservancy , the site contains more mammal species than any national park or wildlife refuge in the Lower 48 . <p> The Gray Ranch also has an abundance of the third type of diversity biologists look for : " ecosystem diversity . " This term refers to the variety off habitats within a region . " One reason the Gray Ranch is so rich in species is that it has so many different kinds of habitats , " says Harris . <p> Maintaining a healthy ecosystem rcquires protecting all three levels  --  gcnetic , species , and ecosystem diversity . Otherwise , significant losses at one level are liable to produce cascading losses at others . For example , some scientists attribute Yellowstone 's small beaver population to the tact that the park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been overbrowsed by elk . The elk inl turn have proliferated because their chief predator . the gray wolf , has been exterminated . ( Large predators often function as " keystone " species whose impacts profoundly affect entire plant and animal cormmunities  --  one argument for reintroducing them , wherever possible , to habitats from which they 've been removed . ) <p> To preserve biodiversity over long periods of time , natural proccesses must also be protected , including the nutrient , hydrologic , and fire cycles that shape ecosystems . " The Everglades are in trouble because of human-caused changes in the water cycle , " says Harris . " Within a few decades , all of the romantic elements we associate with that national park  --  wading birds , red wolves , roseate spoonbills , Florida panthers  --  may be gone . " The park will still exist , of course , but , in the words of conservation biologist Reed Noss , " Scenery is a hollow virtue when ecological integrity has been lost . " <p> What is happening in the Everglades is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been losing natural diversity since the first hunters crossed the Bering Strait . Although many of our landscapes are still scenic , and some are still reasonably healthy , on the whole they have been hollowed out like so many ripe pumpkins by trapping , plowing , logging , mining , damming , poisoning , and other forms of human intrusion . <p> What if , by some quirk of history , the first European settlers had wanted to conserve North America 's natural wealth rather than plunder it ? If they had known what conservation biologists know today , they would have set aside at least two big blocks of land , four times bigger ( say ) than Yellowstone Park , in each of the country 's bioregions . ( Big , to function properly over long periods of time ; two blocks , because you do n't want all your bears or wolverines or redwoods stranded in one spot . ) <p> Historically , of course , the only place we had an opportunity to adopt such a farsighted plan in advance of large-scale human impact was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a chance , and a need , to work backward toward that ideal . Though we may never achieve it all , we can achieve a great deal . According to Forest Service ecologist Hal Salwasser , " If biodiversity has a chance anywhere in the world , it is in North America . " <p> But the task is immense . We 've been beating back the forest for centuries , and it will take an equal effort to recover what we 've lost . " The object , " says landscape architect Leslie Sauer , " is to gradually shift the impact of our actions from being largely negative to being largely positive . " <p> One of the first things we must do is reevaluate our existing system of national parks , wilderness areas , and wildlife refuges . Because these areas were chosen based on criteria that have little biological relevance , Harris calls them " an agglomeration of artifacts . " These wildlands fail to promote biodiversity in two ways . First , regions and habitat types are unequally represented . The West is relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Midwest , bankrupt . We 've saved plenty of snowcapped peaks and scree slopes , but lower-elevation forests , wetlands , grasslands , and coastal areas are underrepresented or , too often , absent altogether . <p> Second , many reserves are too small to maintain all the species once found within them . According to biologist James Brown , " Refuges of less than 125,000 acres in which animals are tightly confined may lose more than half their species in a few thousand years . " Thirty percent of the United States ' national parks and 93 percent of its wildlife refuges fall into that vulnerable category . <p> The significant qualifier is " tightly confined . " Nearly all reserves were originally embedded in a natural matrix ; their boundaries were permeable . But now , as population growth and development continue , many parks and refuges are gradually being transformed into islands in a sea of humanity . ( Roads are a chief culprit . " The highway system is just a killing machine , " says Harris , noting that automobiles are now the leading cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exception there is the seagoing manatee ; its leading cause of death is collision with motorboats . ) <p> Worldwide , habitat fragmentation weighs most heavily on wide-ranging carnivores  --  the wolves and big cats . But fragmentation also harms large herbivores , primates , and bears ; habitat specialists like the giant panda and black-footed ferret ; and species that require virgin forest , such as the lynx and red-cockaded woodpecker . Small creatures are not immune . As forests in the East shrink under development pressure , even songbirds and plants with modest spatial needs find themselves threatened . <p> Among wildlife managers there is a growing realization that fragmentation puts at risk everything conservationists thought they had saved . The fallacy of viewing the national park as a kind of ark has been exposed . Warns conservation biologist David Western , " If we ca n't save nature outside protected areas , not much will survive inside . " <p> To prevent our parks and refuges . I from slowly losing their natural richness , it is essential to buffer them from development . According to William Penn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Stopping our concern at the boundary has got to be replaced with practical applications of buffer zones , regional planning , and consideration of the social and economic conditions adjacent to reserves . " The benefits and difficulties of implementing these ideas are being demonstrated in the Rockies , where federal and state agencies , prodded by concerned citizens , are attempting to fashion a management strategy for the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem . The same grand experiment needs to be tried elsewhere  --  in the Everglades , the Cascades , the Sierra Nevada , and the Appalachians , for example  --  to create cohesive landscape units rather than mosaics of bureaucratic turf . <p> Wildlife corridors and protected lands called " stepping stones " can also help strengthen isolated refuges . By connecting existing parklands , stepping stones can aid migrating birds and wide-ranging predators and herbivores , while helping to link together patchwork landscapes . <p> " Creating corridors will be of particular importance in the East , " says Harris , " where many existing reserves are simply too small to contain even a single panther or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example was the Forest Service 's purchase of 29,000 acres in a corridor that will eventually connect the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge and the Osceola National Forest along the Florida/Georgia border , a move that will dramatically enhance the ecological integrity of both areas . <p> Wildlife corridors are not a panacea , however . They help animals more than plants , and some animals more than others . They can also pass along pests and diseases , and their effectiveness decreases as they become narrower . Despite these limitations , corridors are still one of the most effective tools we have for buttressing existing nature preserves . <p> Another urgent task is to " map the gaps and buy the hot spots "  --  to locate and purchase rare natural communities that are n't currently protected . In many countries , including China and England , biological inventories are a top priority . Not here . If you want to know how the land is shaped , the U. S. Geological Survey will sell you a topographic map . If you want to know what minerals are underground , fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to find out what 's on top of the ground , to locate an undisturbed stretch of riparian habitat in Arizona or a rare plant community in California , the government ca n't help you . <p> Federal agencies have provided limited support to some private efforts , however . With federal help , The Nature Conservancy has made great strides toward completing an inventory of the nation 's rare and endangered species . " Gap analysis , " a satellite-mapping program developed by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service , has also proven its worth in Idaho and may soon be employed nationwide . <p> Although new buffer zones , wildlife corridors , and protected hot spots will help bolster existing parks , wildlife refuges , and national-forest wilderness , our biological heritage can not be preserved solely by these means , for such lands cover only 7 percent of the United States . About 18 percent is currently used for agriculture . Cities and pavement claim another 3 percent . Biologist James Brown believes that the biodiversity battle will be won or lost on the remaining 72 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semi-natural matrix or the semiwild . In the West , much of the semiwild is public land , managed by the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management ; in the East , it is mostly private . The semiwild now hosts a variety of human activities ; the challenge facing conservationists is to balance biodiversity protection with grazing , timber-cutting , recreation , and mining . According to the Forest Service 's Salwasser , it should be possible to " protect genetic resources , sustain viable populations , perpetuate natural biological communities , and maintain a full range of ecological processes while also meeting human needs . " <p> The key will be enlightened management , based on the principles of conservation biology . The Forest Service , BLM , and private landowners will have to start , in Aldo Leopold 's words , " thinking like a mountain . " Whether the " crop " these lands provide is sawlogs , grass , or recreational user-days , the objective should be to harvest a sustainable yield without damaging , or further fragmenting , the wildlife habitat . <p> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ populated Eastern Seaboard ? Although these areas no longer meet the classic definition of wilderness , they still have a role to play in the preservation of biodiversity . Indeed , as the human population of the East continues to grow , the remaining undeveloped lands become even more valuable as wildlife havens . Fortunately , nature is resilient  --  after an absence of many decades , cougars have resumed to New England  --  and the eastern landscape has not reached the point of no return . Says Zev Naveh , an Israeli ecologist , " My part of the world has been heavily grazed for thousands of years . Compared to the goatscape we are working with , your country offers wonderful opportunities . " <p> To seize those opportunities , says Leslie Sauer , " We in the East must set our sights higher . There should be no , place where there is no wildness at all , no site where natural values are not deemed important . It 's time to make a habit of restoration , to take streams out of pipes , rivers out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracts of wilderness in the East are rare , but Reed Noss says " wilderness recovery areas " could be created in the Appalachians by closing roads , restoring habitats , allowing natural fires to burn , and reintroducing extirpated animals such as the panther , bison , and elk . In the Northeast , the Sierra Club and other conservation groups are working to establish extensive reserves within the 26 million acres of forest that carpet Vermont , New Hampshire , Maine , and northern New York . ( See " Let It Be Woods , " page 54 . ) <p> Such ideas may seem visionary . But so was the notion , once upon a time , of even a single national park . <p> The movement to preserve biodiversity represents a natural evolution of conservation strategy . It is both the next step on the road to a land ethic and the ultimate grassroots challenge . Meeting that challenge will require sweat , dedication , and a willingness to take a new look at the American landscape . Nature preserves , new forestry and grazing practices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all levels of government , restoration  --  each will have a role to play . <p> For those who decide to take on these tasks , the work could be satisfying  --  just as it was for a handful of Sierra Club volunteers who began trying to restore a degraded park on the outskirts of Chicago 14 years ago . They prowled railroad grades gathering native seeds , cut thickets that were choking ancient oaks , lit fires to kill invading weeds , and perused 19th-century journals for botanical insights . <p> As news of their labors spread , more and more people turned out to help . This year more than 3,000 people , a veritable Noah 's army , will volunteer their time and talents . Their mission is to salvage something of tremendous significance , a landscape that was said to exist no longer in North America- a tallgrass savanna , a grassland with trees . <p> Nature Conservancy staffer Steve Packard has been one of the project 's guiding lights . Asked what his experiences have taught him about preserving biodiversity , he replies , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thousands of people are involved , and none of us understands more than our own little part of it . Sometimes I visit the site , and the birds are flying around or the flowers are blooming , and I think to myself , ' My goodness , all this depended on us . ' And it did . It feels wonderful .

But that prognosis could change if humans work hard to accomodate the bear .
