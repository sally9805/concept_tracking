How do you begin to judge your father ? The Coast Guard and the insurance company investigators would list my father as blameless in the boating death of Lamar Locklear , our next-door neighbor and my father 's business partner . The boat-a sportsfisher-was christened the Nell , a name my divorced parents had chosen for me had I been born a girl . My father and Lamar considered the Nell firm evidence that , when I finished college and married Lamar 's daughter , Holly , and joined their electrical wiring company , we would all be well underway towards something better than our backlashed lives along the Haw River in North Carolina . We could n't afford to berth the sportsfisher , so the Nell rode out snowstorms and summer cloudbursts on a trailer which straddled a drainage ditch dug as a property line . Then , when hurricane season lowered the coastal rental rates , we hauled the sportsfisher to Hatteras Island , where each year we vacationed at a sound-side cottage , complete with a widow 's walk my mother had waved from in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breezeway which reeked of creosote connected our cottage to an identical one that our fathers rented for prospective clients . <p> My father and Lamar were happiest these two weeks of each year , especially at dusk , when the cottage smelled of baconwrapped mackerel steaks and Old Bay-seasoned water set to boil , clattering with crabs from our trap . Each evening , when the lighted mainland across Roanoke Sound seemed a piece of the night and stars poured down , my father and Lamar made a ceremony of lighting their boat . <p> " No more arguments or complaints , " my father always said . " The Italian has passed over . " It was one of his favorite expressions-the code words to the Allies that the A-bomb had exploded . Lamar then plugged in a drop cord strung from the cottage to the rickety dock where the Nell was moored , illuminating its outline with Christmas lights . My father and Lamar each threw an arm around the other 's shoulders and hefted their Seven and Sevens : they had escorted us across the sound to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world where executives and senators summered and where the first English attempt to found a colony in the New World had failed . My father and Lamar were determined their beachhead would not give or falter . <p> The night the Lucases were due to arrive , we gathered in the kitchen after the ceremonial lighting , and my father toasted , " Here 's to the Lucas deal . " Frank Lucas was a purchasing agent from Southern Bell . He and his wife had been invited to the island for a fishing trip , and they would be staying in the adjacent cottage . Lamar had bid on the wiring for a new Southern Bell plant which would house satellite construction . Up to that point , most of our company 's jobs had involved houses or restaurants , and were very earthbound . <p> " Here 's to the big executives , " Lamar 's wife , Wanda , said . " Ha . " She sank into a wicker chair in her housecoat with her knees at angles against the armrests . " You call renting this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you take note of this . Richard , " she said to me , " you , too . I could have married anyone , but who did I pick ? " Around the kitchen were cans Wanda had opened and left sitting . Wanda Locklear opened cans when she got drunk and angry . <p> " Our ship will come in , " promised Lamar . <p> " It already has . " Wanda pointed to the sportsfisher strung with lights like a celebration no one had bothered to attend . She was a nurse , an LPN , hooked on gin and codeine , who got cranky when we limited her supply . Holly helped her mother to the bedroom to ready themselves for the Lucases . I slipped in after them while Holly combed her mother 's hair . After Wanda promised not to manufacture a disturbance that night , Holly fed her a pill from the supply she governed . <p> On the mainland , once or twice each year , Wanda would n't come home from work , turning up usually at an interstate motel or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sedan at an all-night carp fishing pond . When the police brought Wanda home on these occasions , Lamar would meet the squad car at the edge of our shared driveway , wearing Wanda 's housecoat over his underwear and seeming much older than his forty-five years . <p> " You 're a bastard , " Wanda would scream at Lamar and the sleeping neighborhood . " I want everyone to know you 've made me into what I am . " Money would be passed so her name would n't appear in the newspaper . Soon she would sob she had done nothing wrong-she had just gone out for a little fun , and now everyone thought the worst of her . Once , after the police left , Lamar struck her so hard she lost an incisor . Wife beating and noisy front-yard battles were part of our world . Lamar took Wanda inside and put her to sleep . Then he ambled back outside and unchained his German shepherd , Lucky , who slept beneath the raised bow of the Nell . As he dragged the dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splayed paws cut sharp lines in the dirt . The dog had a perpetual spot of mange on its flanks , and old motor oil was thought to be a home remedy for the disease . Lamar always lifted the mutt by grabbing handfuls of flesh along the withers and rump , so that its muzzle was stretched into a grin . Again and again he dunked the German shepherd as it howled . Upon release , the dog shook and rolled in the drainage ditch . As if in need of regaining its master 's good graces , Lucky brought a stick to Lamar , and they played fetch at first light , while down by the Haw River you could hear the mill generator 's high-pitched whine as it struggled to convert water into a substance as ethereal as electricity . I watched them from my bedroom window , convinced that their sorrow would never be my own . I was twenty , and I actually believed I could escape where I came from . <p> The Lucases were a mismatched couple who warred openly . They brought their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank Lucas kept asking why we had n't invited a swatch of local residents and a senator or two to celebrate his arrival . My father , embarrassed that as renters we knew no one here , blamed the lack of revelers on the stormy Coast Guard forecast . During cocktails , Frank Lucas launched into his life story . Two tall drinks later , his North Carolina rags-to-riches account had exhausted itself . On the third drink , he wanted to arm-wrestle " Mister College . ' He beat me twice , though I tried until my molars ached to slam his arm to the table . <p> " You 've been pushing too many pencils and not enough iron " he said . He was very proud he had risen to purchasing agent without a college education . " Look at what all I got . " He flexed his bicep and pointed to the balcony , where the woman he alternately called " Cheri " and " wife number two " shook her hair back and laughed at something Wanda or Holly had said . Cheri was closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a foot taller , and she wore her boredom as beautifully as any negligee . She and Wanda had struck up the quick , intense , suspicious type of friendship of people who have excesses in common . They discussed which pills to mix with others , and exact proportions . As the women wandered onto the patio , Frank Lucas claimed he golfed weekly with the governor-a man he knew dirt on . <p> " Now that 's power , " he said . <p> " You 're doing fine , " my father said . " You 're living the sweet life . " <p> " Damned right . " Frank Lucas thumbed his barrel chest and crunched on a pretzel as he splashed out the last of the drink he was waving . " I can make you or break you . " <p> " You up for king mackerel fishing tomorrow ? " Any hint of a business deal collapsing made my father skittish . " I bet you 've caught trophy kingfish before . " <p> " I 've hauled in tarpon and marlin . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now there 's two game fish for you . " <p> " You 'll like king mackerel , " my father assured him . " They fight like hell . " <p> " I fight like hell . " Then Frank Lucas went to the bathroom . <p> " This guy 's a jerk , " said Lamar . " What does he mean , make us or break us ? " <p> " He 's just an obnoxious drunk , " said my father . " I bet he throws up all day tomorrow while we fish . " <p> " Hey , bub , where 's my drink ? " Frank Lucas yelled from the bathroom . <p> " Take him a damned drink , " my father said to me . <p> " Let him get it . " I was not taking him a drink while he pissed . <p> " Let him stick it up his ass , " whispered Lamar as the women meandered inside . <p> " I 've got Frankie-boy his drink , " said Cheri Lucas . " He likes to bellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She winked at Wanda . " But he 's really harmless . " She smiled openly at Lamar . " You 're part Indian , right ? " <p> " One-quarter Lumbee , " said Lamar . " Do n't know how the other three quarters got here . " <p> " That 's priceless . I 've heard Indians are big savages . " <p> " I do n't like what 's going on here , " said Frank Lucas , coming back into the room . <p> " You do n't have to like it . " Cheri let her eyes linger on Lamar where they wanted . <p> " Hey , bub . You flirting with my wife ? " Frank Lucas got between Lamar and Cheri . " No one flirts with my wife unless I let them . " <p> " No one is flirting with anyone , " said my father . " Hey , we 're all friends here . We 're all having a few drinks and a nice time . " <p> " That 's right , Frank , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't want them to , and besides , we 're all friends . " Then she walked over and threw her arm around Wanda , who smiled at everyone from the safe place the pills had carried her . " We were talking origins , Frank . I was remarking about the Indian in Lamar . " <p> " I 'm part Lumbee , " said Lamar again . " The Indians who took in the Lost Colonists . " According to legend , the ill-fated first colonists had searched for gold and bickered instead of planting crops and securing their precarious position at Manteo . When winter arrived without Sir Walter Raleigh 's supply ships , they were either killed in a surprise Indian attack or forced to wander inland and lose themselves amidst whatever grace a wilderness had to offer . <p> " I 've got conquistador blood in me , " Frank Lucas said . " I got a coat of arms to prove it . " <p> Cheri Lucas rolled her eyes . " Frank sunk a reasonable fortune into a trace-your-family-tree deal . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know . Frank chose Hernando Cortex . " <p> " Cortes , damn it . " <p> " Cortex , Cortes , whatever . Frank 's choices were limited because he 's a strict Catholic . " She relished the word 's hard c 's . " Catholics never divorce themselves from their past . " <p> Frank Lucas gave her a look that warned this was not the time for this . <p> " You , " she said to my father . " How did you get here ? " " By Buick LeSabre , " he said . <p> " That 's rich , " Cheri said . My father rarely got a joke , so to hide this fact he laughed hardest . This moment of goodwill uncoiled when Cheri suggested they all get raving drunk and have a toga party aboard the Nell . Frank Lucas was quick to produce a camera after they had all changed into bedsheets and Wanda had remarked that a crazy moment like this needed saving . He adjusted the fancy Instamatic on a tripod and fine-tuned the lens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of a wide net with cork buoys and dried starfish decorating a wall . As the bulb flashed , I remembered being a kid thumbing through our photo album thick with people left behind from all the new beginnings my parents had launched their hopes upon . Then the feeling passed , and I took my place with the others as we waited for the picture of our new lives to develop . <p> That night while everyone else toured the sound , Holly and I made love in our room , which adjoined the widow 's walk . Discarded furniture salvaged from a yard sale or the attic of the owner 's inland home gave the room the temporary feel of a place you visit but never fully inhabit . A salty breeze curved the curtain of the storm door . I stripped and lay naked and proud on top of the covers , smoking a joint to the distant collapse of waves as Holly drew her bath water . While the tub filled , she smoked a little with me and giggled when she coughed . Standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explore the parts of herself untouched by the sun . Next she sat before the mirror , combing and twisting her hair into a bun . She clenched the hairpins with her mouth and set into place the coil I would pull down . Finished , she appraised herself in the mirror and checked her teeth . There will be no hurrying this , I thought as she touched up the nail polish on her toes and swung around and blew them dry at me . Holly was most beautiful , women are most beautiful , when caught in the purposeful act of readying the gift of themselves for you . They sense in their preparations the enormousness of simple things-the hair held with the exact number of pins needed to fall when pulled free , or the nails painted bordello-red because she appreciates the fact that you like them that way . As she bathed I thought of her before the mirror , and we seemed in no way connected to our parents out squabbling over spilled drinks and lewd passes and which star to mark a course by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Do n't smoke so much of that stuff that you go sullen on me . " Holly toweled herself in the doorway . Too much pot carried me to a place from which only sufficient sleep could retrieve me . Holly led me onto the widow 's walk . She kneaded my shoulders and soothed me with easy questions : Were summer school classes hard ? ( Yes , I answered , but I had passed them . ) Did I think the Lucases were a sad couple ? ( No sadder than our parents . ) How soon after graduation would we marry ? ( We would decide that my senior year . ) Did I feel our engagement was constraining us ? <p> " What do you mean ? " I asked . <p> " Do you miss seeing other women ? " <p> " No , " I lied . Certain weekends when Holly did n't drive up to Chapel Hill , I slept with a sorority girl named Lisa McQueen , whom everyone called Queenie . <p> " I would n't like to share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you feel constrained ? Is Ron Ramsey still lit up with love for you ? " Ron Ramsey was an apprentice electrician with a stutter and a crush on Holly . She worked as a receptionist-secretary for our fathers business , and once , to demonstrate his love for her , he had unscrewed a sixty-watt bulb , stuck his finger in the socket , and smiled at the bulb 's flickering while his body conducted the current . <p> " He 's nothing for you to worry about . " When she turned me around , we helped ourselves to each other . A previous vacationer had abandoned a lawn chair , and we tested all the positions its unfolding would allow . The weavings made adhesive noises as we shifted love 's positions . By the time we had both finished , we had moved back inside to watch our joining in front of the mirror . We stood like that until we re-inhabited ourselves and became embarrassed . Then we stretched on the bed to spoon . <p> " You do understand we do n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Holly had pushed my head into the secure place between her breasts , and instantly I feared she suspected my whole affair with Lisa McQueen . Then I remembered that , before smoking pot , I had told her the story of a college pal and his girlfriend . My pal 's girlfriend had walked into his dorm room one morning with a travel bag full of dresses . She asked him which one he liked . After the shade went down , she tried them all on for him . She danced around in a front-buttoning dress like country girls wear , a miniskirt which barely hid the sweet cleft of her buttocks , an evening gown with slits up the sides , and a shift so loose he crawled under it like a kid . Between each modeling , they made a regular feast of their love . She had even brought over the ingredients for mimosas . " I want to dress for you today , " this woman had said . " Choose . " My friend told her the miniskirt made him want to bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had been drinking champagne and making morning love . Spring break was the next day , and they were traveling to different places , so they stocked up on the way that skirt made them feel . When school resumed , she confessed she had worn his choice to the abortion clinic . Though my friend did n't want the baby-he was pre-med and his life was on a certain schedule-he broke up with the girl . When he got drunk , he 'd repeat the anecdote , as if it meant something whose message he had yet to divine . This was the story I had told Holly earlier . Now , I pulled my head from her breasts and aligned my eyes with hers . <p> " Are you pregnant ? " I asked . " Did you stop taking the pill ? " <p> " Nope ! ' She thumped my head . " I was thinking about how that girl should never have told him about the abortion . It was something he did n't need to know . " <p> " They should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have talked things out . " <p> Holly started laughing . <p> " What 's so funny ? " <p> " When she came over with those dresses , she had already decided to go through with the abortion . " <p> " But was n't she dishonest ? " <p> " Oh , Richard . That woman wanted him to leave her . By telling him what she had done , she was showing him the way out . Come here , " and Holly smiled as she guided my dick back inside her . Downstairs the revelers had returned ; ice was cracked for drinks , and glasses were filled , but we did n't stop , even when I heard someone climb the steps . I could feel them out in the hall , watching . Then whoever it was seemed to understand what was going on in the room , and they shut the door gently , as if we were feverish but sleeping children whose dreams they were hesitant to disturb . <p> The next morning , when the sun shaped the offshore clouds into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wanda and Cheri a few hundred yards into the sound and anchored our old skiff for flounder . I oiled the big Penn reels and changed steel leaders on the Russel lures . Anything that might heave or toss got battened down . I packed the long coolers with block ice my father had bought before rousting me . Then I chipped two blocks for mixed drinks and iced down the beer . We had gathered two bushel baskets of out-of-season oysters the day before , and I shucked them after enjoying the first few 's salty freshness . In the distance a workman hammered at the first of several weekend attempts to winterize his cottage , while out in the sound the women laughed about something . <p> Much of my adolescence was spent rebuilding that skiff or larger boats , for when anything went wrong in our lives , my father bought and renovated a boat . We replaced keels , fiberglassed hulls , covered seats with Naugahyde , and stitched canvas covers to shield us from the elements . Watching Holly and Wanda and Cheri fish , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cinder-block bungalows we could barely afford . Somehow , we seemed happy with the cold tile floors and two-burner gas stoves . These places smelled of homemade oil-and-vinegar suntan lotion and leaking air conditioners and the peculiar odor of previous tenants ' lives . A tube of discarded lipstick rounded by some woman 's lips and hidden in the back of the medicine cabinet confirmed my simple-minded suspicions that others had passed through these rooms , too . Nights , Holly and I peeked from the room with bunk beds we shared . Like cousins , we were pajama-ed and giggling . Our parents danced slowly in the kitchen . Their inland , quarreling existences had been left behind . We slept to their laughter as they played rook or poker or some all-night board game of chance . <p> Some people reel backwards through time when they smell woodsmoke while children build snowmen , others go giddy over a field of summer fireflies , but I am reduced to a blob of sentiment by Paralichthys dentatus-the common summer flounder . They still seem strange , flat fish left over from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandbars with a piece of the firstcaught flounder 's belly cut into finger-sized strips to imitate a minnow . <p> When my parents were still married , my mother fished alongside Holly and Wanda . I was nine or ten the first time I saw her fish . Kerchiefed , she sat like a man with her feet apart on the gunnel . How had she learned to unhook a flounder so quickly or so easily ? Because of her nervous lapses into hospitals and other men 's many-bedroomed houses , she had always seemed the ghost of my childhood-moody , seasonal , a creature of shut doors and unexplained absences-but when she fished for flounder , I understood my father 's love for her . Each time she hooked one , the rod curved into a smile and the line sang . She cursed if the fish bit the leader , then giggled with Wanda like schoolgirls at naughtiness . Wanda would be braiding Holly 's hair , and my mother would mix gin-and-tonics while my father and Lamar yelled to row in , the carburetor was fixed and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damned boat ? Wanda or my mother would remark . I would pull hard at the oars and practice my oarsmanship . On the way in , the talk would shift to how deliciously bohemian it was to play cards all night and dance at dawn and then drink tonics at nine in the morning . <p> " It 's times like this that I wish your mother had n't jumped ship on us , " my father said , boarding the Nell . He handed me the shrimp he 'd boiled in the cottage . I tossed them in the cardboard box as he poured on the seasonings . We would eat oysters and shrimp all the way to the fishing grounds . He looked at his watch-wishing we were offshore by now-then tuned the shortwave radio . A song on a distant channel mixed with the Coast Guard warnings of moderate to high seas . As my father listened , his face wore the same look as when he talked to my mother with the special telephone extension he had wired from his bedroom window to the fighting chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the business , and he consulted her like an oracle whose luck he felt compelled to court . He gave her counsel on her boyfriends and listened patiently to her confessions . The fact that he could n't have her made her maddeningly desirable . Both my parents loved the Titanic quality of their love . My mother had called just before this vacation to say she was flying to England with some chiropractor . " Do n't let your father screw up this business deal , " she had said to me . " You do n't know the trouble I went through to set this thing up . " <p> My father pitched me a clean bandanna , which I tied on my head pirate-style as he had taught me . " Piece of advice , Richard , " he said out of the blue . " Be careful what you wish for-it might come true . " Absently , he picked through the shrimp and ate some small ones , shell and all . Out in the sound , Holly yelled and held up a doormat-sized flounder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quit scaring the fish and get busy catching more . He watched them for a long time , then he turned to me . He had been trying to get his bandanna just right , but the little flap of triangle kept missing the knot . I fixed it for him . I could tell my fingers on the back of his head gave him barbershop memories of when my mother kept our hair cut . He had even bought her a barber 's chair at an auction in a clumsy attempt to jump-start their marriage . His gift was exactly the wrong thing ; even the garbage men refused to lug it away . <p> The predicted storm system stalled , and the wind lay . Aside from the bilge pump , the Nell performed like a shipwright 's fantasy on a maiden voyage . The rough seas would not arrive until late that night , and the ocean was like a sheet of plastic connected to the sky by a seamless horizon . I mixed drinks for Frank Lucas and Lamar , and we ate with our hands from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the bridge to send him up a few , I carried him a coffee cupful , along with a beer . We were men on water , passing around lemon wedges and Tabasco sauce as we estimated what luck the day would bring . As first mate , my job entailed keeping Frank Lucas liquored up and happy . I shoved the box of shrimp his way and told him to weigh in . There is a pecking order aboard boats , and he was last . When Frank Lucas sucked the heads , too , I almost began to like him . We ate until the last mile buoy , when my father gave the sportsfisher full throttle , and we made what felt like Godspeed with the old Chrysler engine humming on all eight cylinders . We planed at twenty , got a smooth bow spray going , and outdistanced our problems as we sped towards where you must reckon by charts and compasses . When I realized we had long since passed our usual fishing grounds , I gave my father a what's-up look . Blue water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken the Nell this far from shore . <p> Out where the land fell from sight , I got an inkling of why the old-timers called what they saw the New World . It had something to do with inland feelings and left-behind places . You ca n't look at a continent from that distance without imagining a life in its interior . Before , the closest I had come to understanding this were certain autumn afternoons , during high school , when Holly and I drove my motorcycle into the Haw River countryside . We sped by old clapboard , two-story houses set back handsomely from the road . The yards were big enough to be mowed by tractors , and entire families raked and burned leaves . Kids jumped over flames when their parents ' backs were turned , and brothers dumped on bedsheets full of damp leaves , which sent up smoke signals before igniting . Fathers leaned on rakes and watched another end of summer burning . Holly ran her hand beneath my shirt and fingered my navel as she pressed her breasts into my back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we rocketed into the illusion of the road suddenly ending . I imagined I lived in one of those houses with Holly , that I had stopped raking to watch two lovers zoom by . Would I wave at how young I had once been ? would I remark that their speed tempted Providence ? would I wonder at how far inland I had wandered from such recklessness ? That day aboard the Nell , I was a young man getting his first glimpse of an old feeling called the New World . <p> " This is the goddamned life , " yelled my father . He motioned me up to the flying bridge . He claimed I should learn a thing or two about navigating ; after all , the Nell would be mine and Holly 's whenever we wanted . I had driven countless times before , even weaving safely through the shoals of Cape Hatteras when he and Lamar were incapacitated . But my father made a production that day of handing over the wheel . He fetched two cold beers and called out headings as I marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stream water , where big mackerel ran so deep we used downriggers . Whole acres of the ocean 's surface boiled with menhaden , and I trolled through them to catch the kingfish feeding on the school 's bottom . Whenever the Nell felt sluggish , my father snuck below to hand-pump the water the bilge would not siphon . <p> We filled the boat with big kingfish that Frank Lucas fought . Lamar and my father clubbed and gaffed them , and even when there were two fish on , Frank Lucas got angry if he were not allowed to fight both fish to the boat . We played the part of genial fishing guides , even taking pictures as he proudly displayed the largest . Frank Lucas could n't get enough of catching mackerel , and a greedy part of himself would n't allow us to release any . This was before there were ceilings on the number of fish you could keep , and a part of myself was ashamed that we kept fish beyond what my father called " a gentleman 's limit . " Our haul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back from fishing , my father sipped whiskey beside me on the bridge and fiddled with the shortwave radio while I held the Nell on course . I hoped that he did n't see me at the helm as something other than it was . I expected and dreaded a fatherson chat : When would I be ready to learn the subtleties of bidding ? Would Holly and I buy a house near his ? Would we give him one grandchild or seven ? When this conversation never happened , I was relieved . Do n't go into business with your father , my mother had warned . Strike out on your own . This was my last conversation with her , and she had promised to have a drink for us as she crossed the Atlantic . I had thought it a crude remark , but sitting there beside my father , I understood she meant it as a salute , as people at a wake toast a life that has passed . When I caught my father looking up at the sky and whistling , I remembered today was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " We 'll make the dock right at nightfall , " my father said . Behind us , Frank Lucas was tipsy and singing " What Do You Do with a Drunken Sailor . " Lamar led him like a choir director . We habitually sang that when homeward bound , and my father and I joined in , too . Then Lamar remembered that on real fishing cruises , you strung up the fish like those little triangular flags at used car lots . By the time we reached the first mile buoy , the Nell was fringed with mackerel . Lamar even ran up a small one like a Jolly Roger on the outrigger . The Christmas lights got hooked to the generator , and a loose connection made them blink . Fisherman on other boats heading back to port pointed at us and waved the thumbs-up sign . A few displayed their meager catches . When another sportsfisher tried to run up a mackerel and it fell off , there seemed nothing funnier . The gossip on the radio informed us that the other boats had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Landlubbers . " My father clapped me on the back . " Bunch of goddamned featherweights . " Then he broke into all the channels and began broadcasting our adventure . The liquor had gotten to him , and he kept explaining that luck must be pushed and tested . My father believed that the day 's catch was an omen that his own luck was not ruined . <p> When you push circumstances beyond normal limits , you risk discovering things you do n't want to know . Back at the dock , we called the women down to applaud our catch . Mackerel five deep lined the pier like cord wood . Frank Lucas seemed disappointed when my father explained that no one mounted mackerel . We were shirtless and red from the sun and liquor , and we needed a shave and a bath , but we exuded a good sort of frontier feeling . The women sensed and admired this . Holly worked lotion into my shoulders and giggled when the imprint of a quick kiss to my neck disappeared . <p> " Let 's have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank Lucas had begun calling us that offshore . " Sex and drugs and rock ' n ' rollis n't that how the song goes ? " He called marijuana " hooter " and asked my father and Lamar if they partook . <p> " I 'll try anything once , " said my father . <p> " Righto , mate . " Frank Lucas claimed he had pills , too-speed and Quaaludes . " I 'm a walking goddamned pharmacy . " When he produced a fifty and asked would I take care of the fish , my father said that was n't necessary . <p> " Do n't insult me , " said Frank Lucas . " If I want to give him fifty , I will . Where I come from , it 's customary to show your gratitude like this . " I felt like a valet as I tucked the bill in my pocket . Frank Lucas strung his arms around my father and Lamar and said it was time to get down to some righteous partying and serious business . They walked up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their drinks jingled . <p> " Cheri 's not a bad person , but she 's not his wife , " said Holly . She explained her mother and Cheri had been drinking all day and confessing . Frank Lucas could n't get a divorce from his first wife because he and she were strict Catholics . When Holly asked if I could imagine what it must be like to know the person you loved would never marry you , I said I could n't . <p> " Just put in an appearance , mix them some drinks , and come upstairs to me , " Holly said . " I 'll be naked . " <p> I set about cleaning our slaughter . The dock had a fish cleaning station with a spigot and a humming streetlight high on a pole . I worked in the cone of light . The wind had increased , and the sound was whitecapping . The clouds hid the stars and moon and lidded in the darkness . There were so many fish that I scored them vertically and pushed out nuggets of mackerel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as shooting buffalo for their tongues , but I did n't care . The best part-the cheek meat-I left on the fish . I slung the carcasses out into the dark sound for the crabs . By the time I finished , I had bagged and iced over a hundred pounds of mackerel nuggets . <p> When I walked into the cottage , I saw that Frank Lucas had made good on his promise . Wanda snored with an open mouth on the couch , while Cheri twirled like a dancer around the living room . She spun my way and kissed me wetly on the cheek . Then she started spinning again like an out-of-kilter gyroscope . <p> " Whoa , now " said my father . " Which way do these things go ? " He held a joint in each hand and seemed genuinely confused . He saw me and announced that I was his son-as if that were an astounding and philosophical statement . " Here . " He handed me a joint . " We 've never done this together before . " When I took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was Thai stick-good pot laced with opium . Lamar wobbled from the kitchen with a tray of drinks , looked at Wanda , and gave me hers . Three or four more tokes on the joint made me forget my promise to Holly . I reasoned the wait would make going to her more pleasurable . <p> " Frank , " Cheri said . " You 're a bastard , and I 'm passing out . " She lay down like a tired child on the hard floor and closed her eyes . Frank Lucas gave my father and Lamar a what-can-you-dowith-them look and launched into business . He stroked his chin whiskers and calculated . He seemed neither drunk nor high . How long had he waited for this first scent of the end of a deal ? He assured us he had done his homework ; without his contract , our company would go under . <p> " Point number one . " He looked at my father . " Your ex-wife owns one quarter of the business . She handles her personal life so sloppily she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ca n't afford to . " He looked at Lamar . " Point number two . My friends on your local police force tell me you 've offered bribes on several occasions-not that they ever accepted them . " Then he looked at me . " There are all types of fellowships available for an enterprising young man , especially if the governor made a few calls : ' <p> " You know dirt on him , " I said brashly . <p> " You 're such a bright boy . " He looked at Cheri and seemed to falter . " She is beautiful , is n't she ? It 's a shame she 's lying there like that . Is there a more comfortable place she could sleep it off ? Could you help me carry her ? All of you . " <p> Wanda 's bedroom was the closest . I followed with the high heels Cheri had kicked off . Without any ceremony , Frank Lucas stripped her . I was so high that it seemed like a dream . <p> " That 's not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lamar . <p> " Bingo , Mister College , " said Frank Lucas . " What I need is a little help here . You see , after I 'm dead , there 's a good chance she 'll claim common-law wife rights , and I do n't want that . I want everything to go to my real wife and kids . If we could just get some pictures of a little fake love here , I 'd be grateful . I 'm talking snapshots of one of you penetrating her , or , say , in her mouth . Hell , she 's so Quaaluded she 'd never know the difference . I 'd put the pictures in a safety deposit box and will my executor the key . No matter what claims Cheri made , the pictures would invalidate them . My lawyer suggested this . " I felt a trickle of pity for his indiscreet scheme until I realized we were all desperate . <p> " What say , mates ? " Frank Lucas produced a doubloon from his pocket , which he claimed his grandfather had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pick the leading man . He left and came back with the Instamatic , and he promised he would n't get any face except Cheri 's in the picture . I realized we were all shirtless and half-naked as we fumbled with his proposition . Then I felt someone at the door . It was Wanda , stoned . She focused for a moment and comprehended . I understood she had been in rooms like this before-terra incognita-and that she did n't like them any more than we did . <p> " You all are no better than I am , " said Wanda . Cheri moaned and moved in her sleep , and from where Wanda stood , it must have seemed the naked woman was a willing participant . " Oh , Lamar " she said . " What will we do now that I think the worst of you , too ? " When she shut the door , I realized she had seen Holly and me the previous night , and I was ashamed at this room 's difference . <p> " She wo n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know if he was talking about Wanda or Cheri . We stood there , three men fighting the invitation to violate her sleeping beauty . If I had been asked , I do not know if I would have participated in the coin toss . I only stayed long enough to know that Lamar would be in the pictures . He ungirded himself and set about the sordid business at hand . My father looked hard at me-as if about to apologize that our search for the good life had landed us here-and our eyes met for the first time as regretful men . Whole ages passed between us in that sad moment . Frank Lucas readied the Instamatic , and I remembered that , as a kid , I had believed the way the image developed before my eyes was sheer magic . <p> " Richard , get the hell out of here , " my father said-the last command he gave me that I would ever follow-and as I shut the door , I knew that I would never picture any of us the same way again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Holly , except Lisa McQueen . I began with my nervousness concerning our proposed marriage and ended with our fathers below us sealing a deal . My heart wanted out of my chest , and I could n't sit down , nor stop talking . I chain-smoked cigarettes by the widow 's walk and said I would not join the business . Then I cried the tears of a person who wanted sympathy . <p> Holly allowed me to cry , then said , " Grow up . " " What do you mean ? " <p> " Everything comes with a price . Do you think I like playing secretary to save expenses so you can go to college ? Do n't you think that I worry about our marriage ? Whatever my father did , he did for all of us . You 're so naive it 's almost endearing . You would n't ... " But she stopped when my father and Lamar staggered outside and began yelling at each other . The widow 's walk afforded a box view of their argument . Lamar wanted my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to air their heads . My father explained the Nell was not seaworthy in such rough seas . He screamed , had Lamar drunk so much that he did n't understand the bilge pump was malfunctioning ? <p> " All I 'm asking for , mate , is a little pretend love , " said Lamar . They laughed as if it were the best joke they had ever heard and clapped each other on the back . Lamar claimed they would take a little spin like old times , when they were teenagers who had dropped off their dates and spent whole nights debating love 's mysteries . My father unmoored the Nell , but before he could hop aboard , Lamar gunned the sportsfisher from the dock . My father jumped up and down and shouted curses , but Lamar kept going . I am washing my hands of this foolishness , he yelled . He motioned the-hell-with-you with both palms and zigzagged back to the cottage . <p> " He 'll just putter around the sound and probably anchor off a sandbar and drink until he feels better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he dunks Lucky . " <p> " I hope so , " she said . Holly and I watched Lamar ease around the buoy which marked the channel to Cape Hatteras . The Christmas lights made the Nell resemble an all-night party cruiser out for an aimless celebration . He sang a drunken sailor 's ditty whose words were lost over the grumbling of the engine . Was he simply drunk , or was he running from the part of himself he and my father had traded to close a deal ? My father would have no stomach for electrical wiring after that night . He would sell the company at a profit , thanks to the bid Frank Lucas would award . What no one had counted on were the four sizable life insurance policies Lamar had taken out on himself . Each different policy listed one of us as sole beneficiary . The Nell would flounder so close to the shore off Hatteras that the lights of senators ' cottages must have winked at Lamar as he drowned . <p> But I did n't know any of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk . We simply watched him leave , and I found myself wondering what got rabble like us to this place billed as an earthly paradise . A people like mine were not pleasure-fearing Pilgrims , nor the landed aristocracy of the Virginians who would write the Constitution . We would have never crossed the ocean in an organized migration . What got my ancestors here was any situation in which you decided a change in geography might cure your luck . As the anchor dropped , all we would own was queasy stomachs . Once inland , we became whatever the new landscape required : reluctant but rum-fortified revolutionary soldiers ; willing purveyors of smallpox-infested blankets ; traders of horses and human flesh ; sharecroppers and tent revivalists and , later , owners of used cars and second mortgages and damaged dreams . I do know that whatever feeling Lamar was full of as he drove off-drunkenness or loathing or devil-may-care-fueled the journey from the old world to the new one where Holly and I were standing . <p> " We will not be like that , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard at me , the way a woman does when she is deciding something important . I 'm not sure what words could have saved us then . I remembered my father 's advice-Be careful what you wish for-but it seemed an old man 's useless warning . <p> " Ron Ramsey and I are more than just friends . " She let this information sink in . She was giving me a way out . I started to give her tit for tat , but she put her hand over my mouth , as if she had guessed about my dealings with girls like Lisa McQueen and had already forgiven me . We stood like that until she decided whatever it was she was thinking and it felt safe to take her hand away . <p> Is that what happens when two people find themselves marooned at a new place in each other , wrestling not with angels nor each other but with the sadness of passages ? Once the insurance money came through , we would all move to different neighborhoods and separate lives . I marveled at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a widow 's walk to someone I loved but would leave because a greedy part of myself wanted more . I was still young enough to risk my future without her , but old enough to know that the youngness did n't matter . Suddenly , I was as ashamed of myself as I have ever been , yet oddly , I was elated . <p> For the first time in my life , I made love as an adult , without innocent explorations and with a desperate , hungry roughness . We cursed and clawed and bit . The knowledge that Holly would allow me to be the one to leave made me want to plunder something as mysteriously familiar as her body . I felt full of something I can only describe as the sorrow of conquest-a feeling my ancestors must have dismissed as second thoughts when the sight of the New World took their breaths , while at their backs tugged home and those parts of themselves travelers must leave behind . There would be no end to the new beginnings this fresh-found part of myself would exact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do but hope-like your forefathers-that a course can be charted for a lifetime of moments like that ? <p>
