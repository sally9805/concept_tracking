In April 1956 , I got lucky and landed a job as a business writer at TIME . " Son , " my interviewer had asked , " do you know anything about business ? " Stretching reality like bubble gum , I replied , " Sure , sure , I like business very much . " In fact , I did n't know a stock from a bond . But I got the job anyway . <P> The point of this anecdote is that today , no business-news amateur , as I was , could ever nail such a job at a first-rate publication . Once a backwater , business reporting , writing and editing have become smart , sophisticated and the high-walled province of the expert , although it took the better part of 100 years to reach that status . <P> A raucous century that started with virtually no business journalism worth the name is ending with business reporting becoming an industry all its own , occupying much of the space of three national newspapers , three cable networks , three major business magazines and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local newspapers , on broadcast TV , radio and the Internet . <P> The rich roots of all this actually predate the past turn of the century , to 1882 , when three striving journalists  --  Charles Dow , 31 , Edward Jones , 27 , and Charles Bergstresser , 24  --  started Dow Jones &; Co. to pick up news and gossip and then peddle them to brokers , bankers and slippery speculators . In 1889 Dow Jones launched the Wall Street Journal , a four-page stock-and-bond paper . Price : 2cents . As Edward Scharff writes in his book about the company , Worldly Power , " The Dow Jones messenger boys and reporters hustled advertising and subscriptions while they made their rounds ... Much of the financial advertising in the Journal was placed to buy the newspaper 's silence . " <P> At the century 's turn , Dow died , Jones sold out , and in came the new owners : Jessie Waldron Barron , a prim Boston boardinghouse keeper ; and her insatiable journalist husband , who persuaded her to put up the $2,500 down payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 300 lbs . in his prime , was a high-living , big-investing champion of unrestrained capitalism who improved the Journal 's standards while ordering up stories promoting companies whose shares he owned . <P> Honest-to-goodness muckraking , though , was on the way . At McClure 's weekly magazine , Ida Minerva Tarbell , daughter of a Pennsylvania oil producer who had been forced to eat dust by John D. Rockefeller 's Standard Oil trust , was making life hell for the wizened John D. with a 19-part series on Standard Oil that ran from 1902 to 1905 . Her work , plus the reporting of a few other intrepid journalists , notably at the hotly competitive mass-circulation papers of Joseph Pulitzer and William Randolph Hearst , became Teddy Roosevelt 's big stick in his successful drive to bust the trusts . <P> But the 1920s brought in a different era : the Big Boom . Economists chattered about a " plateau of permanent prosperity "  --  sound familiar ? The men who wrote about business were either hacks in eyeshades or dandy dilettantes who looked like escapees from The Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planted their bylines above stories prewritten by corporate flacks ; crusading Congressman Fiorello La Guardia exposed them by producing the canceled checks that the writers had accepted .
