Beverly J. Harvard began her law enforcement career on a bet that she could patrol the streets of Atlanta as effectively as a man . The wager : $100 . At stake : Her pride . The results : Harvard not only proved her point , she beat the odds and last year became the first African-American woman in America to head a major metropolitan police department . After more than 20 years of steady advancement in what is primarily a man 's world , Harvard has solidly answered her own question . " Why not a woman ? " she now asks . " There 's nothing this job would necessarily bring to the table that a woman should not , could not do . " Harvard 's opinion that the average woman could handle the job as competently as any man prompted the bet with her husband Jim , a Delta Air Lines employee , that she could in fact become a police officer . This was after he and some friends questioned the wisdom of aggressively recruiting women to patrol Atlanta 's streets . Chauvinistically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one at least 6 ' ' 2 " tall and weighing 250 pounds  --  could do it , but not Harvard . " I really thought my husband would say , " My wife , she could be anything " and go on with the conversation , " Harvard recalls . " But he said , " Yeah , you 're right , she could never be a police officer . " Later , while driving home , Harvard felt the need to defend herself because , although she did n't want to become a police officer then , she did believe she could if she so desired . In the spirit of their occasional friendly wagers , she told him , " I betcha " I could be a police officer . " To which he replied , " What are we betting this time ? " Before the ride was over , $100 was on the table . Determined , and with a newly earned sociology degree from Atlanta 's Morris Brown College in hand , Harvard set out to obtain the proof she needed to make her point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in retrospect , had she known the magnitude of the hiring process she would never have attempted to join the department . Harvard also had o idea that she would find police work so interesting . Assigned to the department 's communications section just prior to attending the police academy , the then 23-year-old , somewhat sheltered young woman from Macon , Ga. , discovered a bustling , exciting city beyond the Morris Brawn campus where she had previously spent most of her time . " I decided that I really would like to try my hand at talking and learning that police language , " she says . " So I said I 'm going to stay long enough until they let me do that . " Although she was still not really serious about becoming a police officer , Harvard 's intentions to " stay long enough " to learn police lingo extended into attending the academy . She reasoned with her husband that the experience would give her a chance to learn constitutional law and self-defense , among other things , and in the end would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should attend . But halfway through academy training , an enduring bond between Harvard and law enforcement was cemented when she discovered that as a police officer she could fulfill her desire to help people and to work in the public service arena . " At some point , prior to finishing that academy , " she says , " you would have thought I entered knowing and wanting to be a police officer . I did a total conversion during training . I was ready . " However , her husband was n't quite as ready to accept the idea of his wife on her first assignment  --  foot patrol from 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. in a high-crime area . What had begun as friendly banter had turned serious . Now Mrs. Harvard was also Officer Harvard . Her husband was so worried that he had trouble sleeping at night and insisted on following her and her partner around in his car . Eventually , she was able to convince him that if word of what he was doing got back to the department , she would probably be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciate that his wife was a thoroughly trained officer who knew what she was doing . " Once he got over that , " says Harvard , " I was much better off because I was very much concerned about him . " With her commitment firmly in place , Harvard began her ascent through the ranks of the Atlanta Police Department . She spent two years patrolling the streets before being promoted to a number of other positions , including affirmative action specialist and public affairs director . In 1984 she became the department 's first African-American female deputy chief of police and went on to supervise the career development , criminal investigations and administrative services divisions . And at age 37 , when Harvard began to feel it was " now or never , " she took time off to have her now 7-year-old daughter Christa in 1988 . Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell named her acting chief in April 1994 . Last October he appointed her chief of police over a force of more than 2,000 sworn officers and civilians and made her responsible for the department 's $93 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same personal philosophies that initially attracted her to law enforcement and says her greatest personal satisfaction comes from the serve-and-protect aspect of police work . She says she is committed to establishing a solid , trusting relationship between the community and the department . In Harvard 's opinion , the police department can best combat crime by joining forces with the community to prevent it from occurring in the first place . " I 'm truly a prevention person , " she says . " I know that in order to prevent crime , you 've got to get the community involved with that whole process . We 've got to get involved with the community in terms of solving their problems , helping them deal with things that are not necessarily law enforcement issues at the time . Because if you do n't help them address these things at the time , they will ultimately become my issues  --  law enforcement issues . " On the front lines are her patrol officers , the men and women who interact on a daily basis with community residents and leaders . Harvard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The ideal officer , first of all , has to care about people , " she says . " Because if they feel you do n't care , they 're not going to talk to you . And for everything that happens and goes on out there , there 's someone who knows something about it . If people know something about it , then you have to ask the question , " Why are n't they telling the police about it ? " While Harvard also thinks the ideal officer is not " a wimpish kind of person " who is n't stern and tough when necessary , she says most of an Atlanta officer 's day is spent solving a host of problems beyond simply cracking the whip of law enforcement . " When people do n't know who to call , regardless of what the problem is , who do they call ? " asks Harvard . " They call the police . People expect the police to know what to do . We should have a clue , even if helping them means guiding them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , we should be able to help them . So it 's more than just law enforcement . It 's being a number of things . " When asked to describe the ideal police chief , Harvard says that under the umbrella of being a capable administrator , a competent chief is a good communicator who believes in participatory management and is flexible and open to change . " If you 're the type of person who says , " This is the way I do it and I 'm not flexible and I 'm not open to finding new ways , ' ' " she insists , " then you get bogged down and your department becomes stagnant . " A stagnant department is certainly not part of the chiefs plans for the future . She wants to turn what she considers a good police department into a great department . On a personal level , she wants to " go down as being the greatest police chief that the Atlanta Police Department ever had . " And she wants her daughter , Christa , to grow up knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at the same time raise a family and lead a normal life . And on the job , Harvard wants to keep answering her own question : " Why not a woman ? " <p>
