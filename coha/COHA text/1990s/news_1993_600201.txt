<p> About 1,000 taxpayers called USA TODAY 's ninth annual tax hot line Thursday . Answering their questions : experts from the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants . Callers covered a wide variety of topics some simple and straightforward , some tough and complicated . Examples : NO PENALTY THIS YEAR <p> I just prepared my tax return and found I owe more money than I expected . Will I have to pay an underwithholding penalty ? Dave Chelsey , Charleston , W.Va . <p> Probably not . Many taxpayers are finding themselves in a similar situation this year , due to President Bush 's decision to reduce withholding across the board last year . Size of the cut : $ 172.50 for singles , $ 345 for couples filing jointly . That meant bigger paychecks last year but smaller refunds or bigger tax payments this year . Ordinarily , taxpayers who fail to withhold at least 90% of their total tax liability or 100% of their previous year 's taxes must pay a penalty equal to 11% of the underpayment . But the IRS says it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the withholding change . IRS PAYMENTS CAN COST <p> I ca n't afford to pay all of the tax I owe . What should I do ? Mike Luther , Atlanta <p> You can ask the IRS to let you pay in monthly installments . To do that , fill out your Form 1040 , then attach a copy of Form 9465 the request for an installment plan . Write a check for whatever you can afford to pay right now . Mail in the check and the forms . Within 30 days , the IRS will tell you what your monthly payments will be . The catch : You 'll have to pay a penalty for underpayment plus 13% interest on your unpaid balance . Try asking your bank for a loan first . You 'll avoid the penalty , and you may be able to borrow at a lower interest rate . WHEN HOME IS OFFICE <p> I am a pharmaceutical sales representative who keeps an office at home . It 's my only office , and I do almost all of my selling there . What expenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly can deduct all normal business expenses such as equipment and office supplies . You also may be able to deduct a share of the depreciation in the value of your house and part of your utility bills . But the IRS has tough rules for deducting depreciation and utility bills . Earlier this year , the Supreme Court ruled against a Virginia doctor who tried to claim such deductions . Reason : He did most of his work at nearby hospitals , not at home . The key factors cited by the court ? Do taxpayers meet with customers at the taxpayer 's home office or deliver most of their services there ? That test probably excludes most people . Sales representatives , however , may qualify . But be prepared to argue your case before an IRS auditor . <p> One last wrinkle : If you work for someone else , your home-office costs will be considered a miscellaneous expense . You can only deduct miscellaneous expenses that exceed 2% of adjusted gross income , or AGI your total earnings minus some items such as alimony that you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle with the IRS over your home office , make sure you meet that 2% test . DEDUCTING REFINANCING <p> I recently refinanced the mortgage on my home . Can I deduct my points ? Glenn Rausch , Springfield , Ill . <p> Yes , but not all at once . Points on a mortgage to purchase a house generally can be deducted in the year they are paid . But points paid on a refinancing loan have to be amortized , meaning a small portion must be deducted each year over the lifetime of the loan . For example , let 's say you refinanced your home with a $ 100,000 30-year mortgage and paid two points on the loan . Your annual deduction would equal your total points of $ 2,000 , divided by 30 about $ 67 . REFINANCING PART II <p> I refinanced last year for the second time . What do I do about my points ? Sandi Holt , Mound , Minn . <p> First , add up the points on your old mortgage , then subtract the portion you have already amortized and deducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the balance on the return you file this year . Any points on your new loan must be amortized over the lifetime of the mortgage . SCHOLARSHIP TAXATION <p> My child has a college scholarship that includes some costs for room and board . Is that taxable income ? Dennis Sweeney , Cocoa , Fla . <p> Yes . Scholarship money earmarked for tuition , required books , supplies and equipment is not taxable . However , money spent on room and board is taxable , even if the check goes straight to the school . GOING SEPARATE WAYS <p> We have been filing as a married couple filing jointly . Can we switch to married filing separately this year ? John Kerwin , Charlotte , N.C. <p> Go right ahead . Previous filing status does n't restrict what you do in the future . You can alternate from year to year if you want . A joint return often results in a lower tax because certain tax benefits such as child- and dependent-care credits , earned-income credits and an IRA deduction for a non-working spouse only can be claimed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the separate status provides greater tax benefits . Examples : One spouse with low income has high medical expenses or one spouse has a net operating loss on their trade or business . FOR IRAs <p> I earn less than $ 25,000 a year . Can I make deductible contributions to an individual retirement account ? Irma Granton , Jay , Maine <p> Yes . You can deduct up to $ 2,000 in IRA contributions each year . The rules : Taxpayers not covered by company pension plans can claim the full deduction no matter how much they make . But your spouse if you have one ca n't be covered by a pension plan , either . Taxpayers covered by pensions can claim the full deduction if they are single taxpayers with AGI of $ 25,000 or less or couples with AGI of $ 40,000 or less . Deductions are gradually phased out for single taxpayers with AGI from $ 25,000 to $ 35,000 and couples with AGI from $ 40,000 to $ 50,000 . COMPUTING GAINS <p> I have shares in a mutual fund that pays dividends . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some shares recently . How do I figure my capital gain ? Richard Demoya , Madison , Wis . <p> You have several options . One is the " first-in , first-out " method , or FIFO . Under FIFO , the shares you sell are assumed to be the first shares you bought . So if you sold 100 shares of the XYZ Fund , your capital gain would be the difference between the sale price for those shares and the price you paid for the first 100 XYZ shares you purchased including any shares purchased with your reinvested dividends . If you sold another 100 shares , your gain would be based on the price of the second 100 shares you bought and so on . The problem : You have to keep track of when you bought and sold your shares , although some mutual-fund companies will do that for you . Another option : the average cost method . First , you add up the purchase price for all the shares in your account . Then , divide by the total number of shares . Result : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to determine your capital gain . A third option : You can arbitrarily designate whether the shares you sold are the first ones you bought , the last ones or any in between . But you 'll have to keep track of those decisions . Whatever method you choose , think carefully : You 'll have to use it in the future if you sell shares in that fund . DIVORCE DEUCTIONS <p> I had to give my wife $ 27,000 to buy a house as part of a divorce settlement . Is that a deductible expense ? Jim Garretty , Chicago <p> No . Alimony payments are the only deductible divorce expenses , and such lump-sum property settlements are not considered alimony for tax purposes . <p> FORMS BY FAX Need tax forms ?
