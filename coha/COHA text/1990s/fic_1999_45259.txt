" Tonio , no ! Tonio , listen to me . " <p> Vivaldi would not be calmed ; shaking off Umberto 's hand , he continued his relentless advance upon his target . His long strides carried him across the marble floor of St. Mark 's Cathedral , oblivious to the murmurs of the listening audience . <p> Umberto-short , stocky , faithful Umberto-plucked again at Vivaldi 's sleeve . " Tonio , " he wheedled , " please , consider your actions ! Do n't you know who that is ? " <p> " Of course I know who that is , " Vivaldi snapped , shaking free a second time . " Do you take me for a jackass ? Does he know who I am ? " <p> By now , almost all of the audience was ignoring the mandolin concerto that the orchestra of sixty white-clad novice nuns was attempting to complete . Their attention had shifted to the tall , furious-looking Vivaldi as he made his way directly for the seats reserved for the ducal party . Though he was noted as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temper and frequent lack of tact . <p> His target-a brooding , middle-aged man of dignified mien and expensive clothing-seemed utterly oblivious of the verbal storm heading his way . His long hair was streaked with grey at the temples ; his chin rested on his right fist . His cape was tossed almost carelessly by his side , as if to make a barrier between himself and the armed retainer who was watching over him . <p> The retainer had spotted Vivaldi , and seemed at a loss for what to do . In the normal course of events , seeing an angry man heading for his lord , the soldier would have drawn his sword and prepared to dispatch the man to the mercies of the Savior . But this was clearly no simple assassin-this was Antonio Vivaldi , Maestro di concerti for the nearby Ospedale della Pietra , and the most famed composer in Venice in this year of grace , 1710 . Spitting this man on the point of a sword would not go down well . Finally , after an eternity of indecision , the retainer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The brooding man finally glanced up , first at the soldier , and then , following the soldier 's gaze , towards the figure heading his way . He saw a tall priest , with long , once-neat red hair , curled and neck-length , but now wildly in disarray , as if the man had been literally tearing at it . The furious face boasted a prominent , arched nose , and a high forehead . Vivaldi ground to a halt in front of the noble , shaking off Umberto 's clutch for the final time . " Sir ! " Vivaldi roared , glaring away the soldier from interposing himself between the two men , " I do trust that my music is not keeping you from your rest ? " <p> The man looked up , his eyes almost alight with laughter . " I see that they named you well il prete rosso , " he replied . " The red priest-in temper as well as hair . Do you know who you are addressing in that insolent tone ? " <p> " Of course I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , right-hand man of the Duke of Milano . " <p> " Ah . You were told I would be attending this concert , then ? " <p> " No . " Vivaldi was calming down slightly , at least sufficiently to talk in a more normal tone of voice . " I do not care who attends my concerts , as long as they listen . " <p> Montello shrugged . " Then how do you know my name , Signor Priest ? " <p> " It 's glaringly obvious , " Vivaldi retorted . " Your manner of dress labels you a person of wealth . Your accent is that appalling Milano dialect that grates on the ears of a musician . Your retainer " - he glared at the soldier once again- " bears the arms of the Duke of Milan . Only one person to my knowledge is due in Venice this month from that city of your rank . " <p> Montello smiled tightly . " You can clearly use your brain , maestro , " he sighed . " So surely you can see that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music ? " <p> The composer snorted . " This cathedral is dedicated to the glory of God , as is my music , Signor Montello . I would suggest that your problems be left outside , and that you contemplate the mercies of God and the beauty of my compositions . " <p> Montello sighed again , and shifted in his seat . " Vivaldi , " he growled , " I have been patient with you thus far for the sake of your reputation as both a musician and an ill-tempered priest . But do not overtax my good nature . I have other concerns at this time . " <p> Umberto plucked at Vivaldi 's sleeve again . " See , Tonio ? " he begged . " Milord Montello is being kind . Let 's go , Tonio . " Refusing to be placated , Vivaldi snapped back at Montello : " I can tell that you have other concerns . Is it the murder or the theft that bothers you the most ? " <p> That broke Montello 's forced , casual manner completely . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him down relentlessly . " What do you know of either ? " he hissed , furious , and glaring about to make certain that no one would continue to listen to the argument . The audience-knowing what was good for them-took the hint , and pointedly returned to listening to the concerto , which the female orchestra was still working to complete . <p> " I know nothing of them , " Vivaldi replied , for the first time realizing that his temper had now drawn him into a potentially violent confrontation . " At least , nothing beyond the obvious . " <p> " What do you mean by that ? " <p> The musician gestured at the hand that still clutched his robe . " There is blood on your sleeve , " he said . " Since you are uninjured , it clearly came from bending over a wounded man . The darkness of the color indicates that it was arterial blood , so the man was unlikely to have survived the injury . It is below your arm , where you clearly did not see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent . " <p> " And the theft you mentioned ? " <p> Again , Vivaldi pointed to the fist . " I can see the lines on your finger where your large signet ring once sat . You 've attempted to cover its loss with a second ring , which is smaller and less ornate , leaving the lines of the original visible . " He sniffed . " Obviously , someone close to you was killed just before the concert , and your signet ring stolen . " <p> For a further moment , Montello retained his grip , and then nodded and loosened it . Vivaldi straightened up , and smoothed out the front of his robe . " You are an observant man , priest , " the noble commented . " It is a pity that you can not help me to locate the assassin and the stolen object . " <p> " If it will enable you to concentrate on my music , " Vivaldi replied , " then I shall be happy to deal with your small problem . " Montello looked him over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be of use , " he admitted . " Are you able to leave now ? " <p> " You have already ruined my enjoyment of the concert , " the musician sighed . " I may as well come with you . Umberto , tell Maria that she is to complete the program and then to see that the girls get back to the Ospedale afterwards . Then return to me . " <p> Umberto hurried off to do as he was instructed , glad that Vivaldi 's temper had not created greater trouble for them both . Much as he liked the older man , his master could be a real problem at times for them both . Montello watched him depart , a real smile crossing his lips . " Your understudy ? " he asked . <p> Vivaldi laughed , a short bark . " Hardly that . He 's my aide , a man with no musical talent . However , he is a reformed pickpocket and has many other uses , even if the poor fool is tone-deaf . " <p> The noble nodded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be told you this night ? " <p> " Oh , certainly , " Vivaldi answered , brushing aside the question . " He 's almost as tactful as I am . " <p> Montello raised his eyebrow at this incredible claim , but said nothing . The maestro 's behavior thus far could hardly be considered inspiring of confidence . " I am here this evening , " he said , instead of the acidic comment on his mind , " because my enemies would have remarked my absence . I have managed , with your Lord 's help , to keep the murder and theft quiet . I would appreciate your discretion . " <p> " You have it , " Vivaldi agreed . <p> " Good . Let us leave as though I were asking you to compose a selection of music for me . That way , we shall draw no further undue attention to ourselves this night . " He stood up , and his retainer handed him his cloak . " Walk with me , composer , " he said , as he fastened his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussing a potential concerto , down the long aisle of St. Mark 's , and out into the portico beyond . Night had fallen , and the lights of the city flickered uncertainly in the gloom . The two men and the guard stood by the portico , until Umberto hurried out to join them , his chubby face flushed with rushing about . As they began their way through the muddy , cramped streets , two other armed men slipped out from the shadows of the cathedral to fall in behind them . They wore the livery of Venice , and not Milan . Vivaldi said nothing , and deigned to pay attention to Montello . <p> " It happened barely an hour ago , " he told the composer . " I was leaving the lodgings provided for me by the Duke when I realized that I had inadvertently left my signet ring behind . I returned to the house , and called for Pietro , my secretary . There was no reply , so I hurried upstairs . There I met my sergeant at arms , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my rooms and found Pietro dead on the floor , and my signet ring gone from the desk . " <p> " You are certain that your secretary had the ring when you left ? " Vivaldi asked . <p> " Yes . He was preparing papers for me to sign on my return . " <p> " And he was killed how ? " <p> " A sword-thrust in the back . He was slumped over the desk when I found him . I must have gotten the blood on my sleeve when I turned him over to be certain that he was dead . " <p> Vivaldi nodded . " And then ? " <p> " I sent the sergeant for a messenger to go to your Duke that instant . I waited long enough for the men the Duke sent to arrive , but dared not delay my appearance at your concert . I have enemies in this city who would have noted my absence and realized that something was amiss . " <p> " May I ask what the papers that were being prepared were about ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It is not a matter that would concern you , Signor Priest . " <p> Sighing , Vivaldi shook his head . " It may explain the reasons for your secretary 's death . I do not ask for details , merely generalizations . There is clearly something of import in those papers , else you would have wanted your secretary to come with you this evening , and this tragedy might have been averted . " <p> Montello nodded , reluctantly . " I am empowered to conduct a new trade agreement , " he finally said . " It will be of benefit to Venice and Milan , but will undoubtedly annoy Verona . " <p> " Ah . Then you suspect an agent of Verona is behind this ? " " Undoubtedly . I already have men out scouring the road to Verona for signs of anyone in a hurry heading in that direction . " <p> " It may be of some use , " the musician agreed , carelessly . They had arrived at the house set aside for the use of Montello . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muddy pathways , and with a sturdy wall about it . There was a single guard at the doorway through the gate , and he saluted as he passed the small party through . <p> The garden was tiny , and the house bulky and impressive . Another guard answered the retainer 's curt knock , and let them into the candle-lit hallway . <p> " The study is upstairs , " Montello announced . " By now , I expect that the body will have been removed . " <p> " Good , " Vivaldi replied . " I have little desire to gaze on the mortal remains . Life is frequently unpleasant enough , without any need to be reminded of our eventual ends . " He stomped up the narrow stairs and glanced about the landing . Outside one door , the sergeant at arms stood waiting . Vivaldi headed for it , only to find his way barred . <p> " It 's all right , Giacopo , " Montello called from behind him . " We 're going into the study . " <p> Giacopo clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vivaldi another glower of distrust , and then nodded to his master and stood reluctantly aside . Vivaldi glared back , taking in the crisp livery of Milan , and noting that the man had his hand upon his sword hilt . The weapon quivered in his hand , partly from the annoyance of the guard and also because it was slightly too small for its scabbard . You 'd think a man in the employ of the powers of Milan could afford a better sword than that . Pushing open the door , the composer strode into the study . <p> The room was now devoid of the corpse of the unfortunate secretary . There was , however , an additional guard inside , this one in the livery of Venice . The ornate wooden desk , below the room 's single window , bore testimony to the secretary 's one-time presence , though : a dark stain on the top and a matching one on the woven carpet both testified to the spilling of his lifeblood . <p> A small candelabra stood on the desk , and another on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grotesque shadows about the room . Vivaldi strode to the center of the apartment , and began to look about him , spinning on his heels to take in all the details . He barely seemed to notice when Montello , Umberto , and the sergeantjoined him in the room . <p> The desk had several sheets of expensive vellum upon it , clearly the paper for the treaties that were to be drawn up . A quill pen lay on the carpet , crushed . Apparently , one of the men who had cleared away the body had stepped upon it and broken it . A small pot of ink lay on the desk , uncapped . <p> The window was shattered , small shards of glass covering the carpet and parts of the surface of the desk . A slight draft came in through the broken opening , causing the flickering of the candles . <p> The walls were lined with tapestries , save for the space above the large fireplace . Since it was still warm at nights the grate was devoid of its usual cheery flames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an inch of shining steel exposed . Over this was the crest of the city .... Which left the door to the landing . The room did not lead into the bedroom or anywhere else , so that and the window were the only means of gaining access to this room . <p> Vivaldi 's eyes returned to the window . " Umberto , " he said , " would you be so kind as to throw open the window ? " <p> " Not enough of a draft in here already for you ? " Montello growled . " Or are you checking on the route the assassin took ? " <p> " I beg your pardon ? " Vivaldi asked , as Umberto did as he had been requested . Ignoring the view from the window , the musician bent to examine the sill . <p> " Well , " Montello explained , " I 'm no expert , but clearly the man who did the deed came through the window , killed poor Pietro , and then left before the sergeant and I came in . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Umberto to close the window again . Then he stomped back into the center of the room , and thought for a moment before speaking . <p> " That is the obvious assumption , " he agreed . " It does not sit well with me . I am a composer , Signor Montello , and I am used to taking small things like notes and making large things-like concerti-from them . The obvious rarely appeals to me-even the most ignorant peasant can compose a tune using the obvious . The saltarello , for example-infectious , granted , but simplistic . I prefer the elegant , the unexpected , the hidden resonances to be coaxed from the instruments . " <p> The noble sighed , impatiently . " Maestro , this is very illuminating , but I did not bring you here for a lecture in musical composition . " <p> " Quite , " Vivaldi agreed . " I merely lay the groundwork . As I said , I dislike the obvious . Especially in cases like this , when the obvious is obviously wrong . " He held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his palm . " This was embedded in the sill . It is of the same beautiful Venetian glass as the shards that remain in the pane . Therefore , the window was open when the glass was shattered . You were meant to assume that the killer came from the outside , when he was inside with you all of the time . I believe that you can recall your men that are scouring the roads to Verona . " He gestured to the sergeant at arms . " I think you 'll find that he still has the signet ring on him . " <p> It was hard to say who was the more surprised , but the sergeant recovered his wits the fastest . He drew his sword , panicking , and backed towards the door . Vivaldi paled , and retreated . Montello 's hand flashed towards the blade at his waist , but Umberto 's hand went to the desk . He picked up the inkpot and tossed it accurately into the face of the sergeant . Ink flew out , mixed with the blood the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard then grabbed the injured traitor 's wrist , holding down the sword . Umberto followed through with a punch that laid the killer cold . <p> The nobleman turned an annoyed face to Vivaldi . " You maniac ! " he hissed . " Why on earth did n't you warn us , first ? Did n't you realize he would try and fight his way out ? " " No , " Vivaldi shrugged . " It did n't occur to me . " Drawing his dignity about him , he added : " I am a composer , not a street brawler , after all . " <p> Sighing , Montello advised : " You should stay that way ; you would not last a second in a fight . " " Here it is ! " Umberto straightened up from the unconscious man 's body , holding out the missing signet ring . " In his belt , " he explained . <p> Montello reclaimed his property with delight . Then he nodded for the guard to remove the sergeant . " I shall have him dealt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was behind this . " <p> Vivaldi did n't want to know how the information would be extracted . " I imagine you 'll discover that you were correct in assuming that there are political overtones to the killing , " Vivaldi agreed . " Politics and these silly feuds between our cities claim too many lives , if you ask me . " <p> Montello did n't seem to care about his barbed comment . Instead , he sat down at the chair by the desk , examining his ring happily . He removed the ring from his finger , and slipped the signet back into its usual place . " All right , maestro , " he said . " I 'd like you to explain how it was that you knew that the sergeant had taken the ring and killed Pietro . " <p> " Simple , " Vivaldi sniffed . " You had mentioned that your secretary had been stabbed in the back . I could not imagine that he would have sat at this desk and watched someone break through the window in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absurd to assume that he would have remained seated while the assassin jumped down from the window , came behind him and stabbed him through . Finding the glass on the sill proved that the window had been opened after the murder , and that the killer had then reached outside to punch in the glass , so that it would look as if entry had been made that way . <p> " Clearly , then , the killer was in the house to begin with . Besides that , no outsider could possibly have known that you had forgotten to take your signet ring back from your man this evening . An insider could have seen it , and taken the opportunity . It was simple to realize that your secretary would have ignored someone he knew entering the room , and thus allowed himself to be stabbed in the back . " <p> " That I can see , " agreed the noble . " But what made you certain that it was the sergeant ? And that he still had the ring ? " " Painfully obvious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering Montello . " You had mentioned that when you came upstairs , the sergeant was already here . Yet he did not mention hearing the window break . When I met the man , I noted that his sword seemed loose in his scabbard , which is curious , since you are a man of wealth . I would have expected you to have been fastidious about purchasing swords that fit better . Then I spotted that sword on the wall " - he gestured to the display above the fireplace . " If you look , you will see that it seems a trifle large for the scabbard . Umberto ? " <p> Reaching up , the tubby man withdrew the blade . On the point was dried blood . Vivaldi gestured to it . " The murder weapon . " He smiled . " When you question the sergeant , I think he will tell you that after you had left for the concert , he seized his chance to get your signet ring . Undoubtedly , he and the agents of Verona were to use it in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are negotiating . He was forced to kill your secretary to get the ring , and then he started to fake an intruder 's presence to mislead you upon your return . However , you had realized that you had forgotten your ring , and came back for it . <p> " Hearing you returning on the stairs , and you calling for the slain man , the sergeant had a scant few seconds . His sword was stained from the murder , so he hastily switched it for the one above the mantel , and then rushed outside to meet you . He then pretended to have been alarmed also . Then you had the Duke 's men brought in before beginning your trip to the concert again . <p> " There was no way now that the sergeant could leave the house and pass the stolen ring to his confederates . He had expected to have had several hours while you were out of the house to do the deed , you see . Thus , the ring had to have remained in his possession . " <p> Montello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My friend , you are a genius ! " he exclaimed . " At that ? " Vivaldi waved his hand , airily . " A game , no more . But you are correct in that I am a genius-at music . There is a second concert for tomorrow night . I trust you will be able to pay attention to my compositions now that I have solved your little problem ? " <p> The noble laughed . " I assure you , maestro , that there will be no more appreciative member of the audience tomorrow night than myself ! " <p> " Good , " the musician replied , rudely . " I shall expect you to keep your word . You may tell me afterwards how brilliant I am . " He looked towards Umberto . " Well , if we hurry , we may have time for a glass of wine before the girls return to the Ospedale . All of this running about has given me quite a thirst . " <p>              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
