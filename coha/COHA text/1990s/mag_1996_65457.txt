You get the feeling Fred Couples rolls out of bed looking like Dr. Cliff Truelove on Days of Our Children . He is the sort who could make a Hefty 40-gallon trash bag look like something by After Six . Happy and unhurriable , he is a kind of Winnie the Pooh in cleats , ambling along , life coming easily and in bunches . His swing is slower than the last day of school , holes jump in the way of his golf balls , and money knocks on doors to find him . He is allergic to practice yet has 17 tournament wins worldwide , including a Masters , almost $8 million in career earnings on the PGA Tour , a collection of vintage Mustangs and a traffic-stopping fianc ? e. // Tommy Tolles , on the other hand , looks like a walking antacid commercial . He is only 29 , but his worried , coal-black eyes are dark-rimmed , and his eyebrows bend toward his nose like a stock-market plunge . Clothes hang awkwardly on his flagstick body , and he has a barber-school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is a citizen of Flat Rock , N.C. , where his idea of a perfect day is to " pull a few weeds . " He must practice constantly , has won the Nike Ozarks Classic and last year finished 116th on the Tour money list . Before that he spent seven years trying to scrape out a living on the discount tours with a frenetic swing that ends up with his arms wrapped around him like a straitjacket . Generally , if rain is expected , it will fall on Tommy Tolles. // Yet there they were on Sunday , golf 's Cary Grant and Arnold Stang , one shot apart with three holes to play at the year 's biggest tournament so far , the near-major cashfest known as the Players Championship in Ponte Vedra Beach , Fla. // To Couples , a win would have meant absolutely ... nothing . " I could care less about the money $630,000 for first place , fattest in PGA Tour history or the exemption 10 years , " he said during the week . That was odd because the 36-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a near-major in more than two years , not since he folded up in back pain on the practice range of the 1994 Doral Open . But then Couples is most blissful when he is away from the spotlight he so dearly hates . Since his great years of 1991 and ' 92 , when he won five Tour events , Couples has changed his home ( from West Palm Beach to Dallas ) , his main squeeze ( from Deborah , after an ugly , expensive divorce , to fianc ? e Tawnya Dodds ) and his money-list ranking ( from No. 1 to No. 63 ) . He became something of a Czar of the Silly Season , which is golf 's unofficial , global money grab from November to New Year 's Eve , when the real tournaments are n't played . " Nobody practices for those things . " he explains . " So they 're kind of right up my alley . " // But now , with a new doctor who makes house calls  --  physical therapist Tom Boers flew in from Columbus , Ga. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there in the hotel room  --  he seemed to be swinging as sweetly as ever . Not that the patient appeared starving for a comeback . " Are n't you hungry for a win ? " Couples was asked during the week . He thought for a second , shrugged his shoulders and said , " Sure . " Not exactly Lust for Life . // To Tolles , on the other hand , a win would have meant just about ... everything . A victory would keep him on the Tour until 2006 . That he was even close was almost more than his brain could process . On Friday night , after shooting a second-round 64 to take a two-shot lead , he nearly wore out his hotel TV remote , flipping back and forth between ESPN and CNN to see his name on the screen . " I finally had to stop , " he said . " My heart was so inflated I thought it was going to explode . " // The whole week was an exercise in opposites . Every day some double-Dopplered weatherman predicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of last Thursday 's round was postponed . All week the talk was about how the streak of first-time Tour winners would end at three at the Players , what with the finest field of the year entered and Pete Dye 's Little Shop of Horrors TPC course lurking . But three of the first four names on the leader board by last Saturday evening  --  Tolles , David Duval and Michael Bradley  --  had never appeared on a Tour trophy . // Meanwhile , galactics like Greg Norman , Nick Faldo , Paul Azinger , Curtis Strange and Tom Kite had missed the cut . It was the first time in Norman 's 17-year career that he had missed two cuts running , having shot a second-round 76 two weeks ago at Bay Hill . Not very timely , considering Augusta is his next start . " Three strikes and I 'm out , " he said . // Sunday morning dawned as a very big deal to Tolles , who had gone to bed still holding on to a two-shot lead , then tossed and turned and grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not going to lie , " he would say later , " I was nervous . I was kind of in a fog , just watching myself playing stupid . " // At four shots back Couples was asked before the final round if he would need to shoot another 63 , equaling his course record , to win . " Wait , wait , " he said . " I do n't have any 63s in me. " // But sometimes the harder you try , the worse you do , and the less you worry , the more you succeed . Couples and his swing and his infernal inner peace came out on Sunday with locked-on radar . He hit within three feet on the 5th hole and two feet on the 8th , drained everything and had himself a sporty 32 on the front nine . He had closed the lead of Tolles and sudden arrival Colin Montgomerie to one shot . Said Couples 's longtime caddie , Joe LaCava , " With Freddy , he either has it , or he really , really has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew he really , really had it . " // On the back nine , Tolles and Montgomerie played keep-away with the lead , while Couples remained one back . " Hey , look at that , " Couples said to LaCava , standing in the middle of the 16th fairway , checking a scoreboard . " Monty birdied 16. " // " No , " said LaCava . " He 's behind us . He just birdied 14 . " Vive la difference . The strategy changed . Couples would go for eagle on the par-5 16th , since his two rivals would surely make birdie there and perhaps eagle themselves . LaCava put a two-iron in his man 's hand , and Couples looked out at a sucker pin , tucked behind 220 yards of grass , bunker , lake , railroad ties and death . After Couples hit , LaCava said , " Get up . " That is a very famous phrase between the two because it was exactly what LaCava had said in 1992 , after Couples hit his final-round eight-iron shot at Augusta National 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got up just enough to cling , impossibly , to a steep pond bank in front of the green , defying physics and preserving an eventual Masters victory . This two-iron shot , though , did n't seem to be listening . It was going short and right and ugly . " I figured it was wet , " said Couples . // But Couples is the kind of guy who could put a quarter in a pay phone and have it pay 100 to 1 . The ball landed two feet beyond the water 's edge , hit a little bank , then bounded crazily , unthinkably left , away from the water on the other three sides and to within 25 feet of the stick . " Another foot either way and we 're in the water , " said LaCava. // Then Couples stepped up and stroked the ball into the bottom of the little white cup for an eagle and a one-shot lead . // Tolles was standing on the 14th green at the time . " I 've been in the gallery at the Masters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the crowd after Jack Nicklaus made birdies , but you do n't hear a lot of roars any louder than the one I heard today for Freddy . It sounded like 20,000 people just won the lottery . " // And after Couples went on to make a 30-footer on the island-green 17th for yet another birdie , Tolles said , " It sounded like those same 20,000 people won the lottery again . " // The roars must have shaken Tolles 's inner ear because suddenly he got vertigo . He hit his approach at 15 off a mound near the green and made bogey , then made nothing pars at the 16th and the 17th , and bogeyed 18 . Trying to catch up , Montgomerie rinsed his second shot on the 16th and made the first of two closing bogeys. // So Couples had told the truth . He did not have any 63s in him , but he had a 64 , which did nicely . " I hate to say it , " he admitted afterward , " but it was a pretty easy 64 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had simply reached out and grabbed the tournament by the larynx , going three under on the last three infamous holes to Tolles 's one over and Montgomerie 's two over . Couples won by four shots with an 18-under 270 , reclaiming a title he had won 12 years earlier , the first player to repeat as champion at the TPC course . // So , what does this mean to you , Freddy ? " I guess it gives me another trophy and some crystal and a bunch of money , " he said . Worse than that , it means he has got to stay on the Tour until he 's 46 . " That 's scary , " he said . " I was n't really planning on playing that long . " // Tolles would strangle to have such a problem . " I guess the fairy tale is n't going to happen this week , " he said glumly . Despite a third-place finish two weeks ago at New Orleans and a share of second place on Sunday , not to mention the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked like a man who would like to go back to Flat Rock and crawl under it . " I hope I do something different next time , " he said , chin heavy in his hands , " or I am going to live a real disappointing life . " // Definite Eeyore.
