<p> The O.J. Simpson trial is in its most contentious phase : presentation of DNA evidence that may link Simpson to the murders . <p> Much of the prosecution 's DNA testing was done by Cellmark Diagnostics of Germantown , Md . Company director Robin Cotton is on the stand and will spell out the results . <p> More DNA scientists are on the prosecution 's witness list . The defense will bring its own experts to dispute their testimony . <p> Here are the terms and issues that will be heard for weeks . Q : What is DNA ? <p> A : Almost every human cell has a ribbon called deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA . It 's made up of two matching spirals , known as the double helix . The strands are connected by chemical bases , like rungs in a ladder . The order of the strands make up genetic code , such as two legs , blond hair , brown eyes . <p> Through DNA testing , scientists try to determine the sequence of strands from samples of blood , saliva , hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a match with DNA taken from a suspect , it 's a boon to the prosecution  --  if it can convince a jury that the tests are conclusive and error-free . <p> A " no match " gives the defense a powerful tool . There is no argument in the scientific community that DNA does not produce " false positive " results . Q : Which DNA tests are used in the Simpson case ? <p> A : Two basic types : <p> RFLP ( Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism ) . The most conclusive but most time-consuming of all DNA tests . The weeks-long test tries to break the DNA chain into small fragments , identify those that are variable and measure the length of those fragments . If the fragments in two samples are the same length , it 's evidence that they came from the same person . RFLP tests require larger samples and much of the analysis is done via computers . <p> PCR ( Polymerase Chain Reaction ) . Less conclusive but widely used because tests can be done in just a few days . PCR-based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small and less well-preserved samples by amplifying a fragment of DNA millions of times . The test is more often used to exclude a suspect . <p> Among PCR tests : DQ-alpha , Polymarker , and D1S80  --  all used by the Simpson prosecution . Tests look at six different genes and for matches in 21 possible combinations . Some of the matches are extremely rare . PCR results appear as a series of blue and blank spots on a nylon strip  --  reminiscent of a home-pregnancy test kit . Blue is a match . Blank is not . Q : What are the test stages ? <p> A : Collection of samples . Investigators send articles of clothing or objects that contain samples they want tested to forensic laboratories . If the fluid  --  such as much of the blood in the Simpson case  --  is on a hard surface , the blood is lifted onto a swatch of material or swab moistened with distilled water for easier analysis . <p> In the Simpson case , many of the samples were lifted from driveways and from his Ford Bronco . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swatch . All of it goes in an airtight cabinet to dry and then in a freezer to slow the breakdown of DNA prior to testing . <p> The defense already has argued that the samples , collected by Los Angeles police criminalists Dennis Fung and Andrea Mazzola , were contaminated  --  because the same tools were used to gather different samples or the samples were not properly refrigerated . The prosecution says that any mistake in collecting blood evidence would not compromise the results . <p> DNA extraction . A small piece of a swatch is put into a tiny test tube and treated with chemicals to burst the cells and release the DNA . Once extracted , it 's put in another small tube and the DNA is cleansed with organic solvents . <p> Cutting the DNA . By adding enzymes  --  which act as biological scissors  --  the DNA is cut into fragments . Particular enzymes can cut the DNA molecule at specific sites of its sequence . <p> Gel electropheris . This process separates fragments according to their lengths . Negatively charged fragments are put at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with starch instead of sugar . At the other end , positively charged electrical currents flow . That causes DNA fragments to move toward it across the gel . Shorter fragments move faster and farther . <p> Southern transfer or blotting . In order to have a permanent copy of the fragments , a sheet of nylon is placed on top of the gel . Paper absorbs the liquid in the gel so the fragments attach themselves to the nylon sheet . At the same time , the DNA is treated with chemicals or heat to cause the fragments to unzip into two single strands . <p> Autoradiography . Often called " autorad , " it 's an X-ray film of the nylon membrane that scientists search for matches . <p> Interpreting the DNA print . First , the patterns are " eyeballed " to determine if there 's a likely match . Most exclusions are obvious . If not so obvious , the bands are measured through the computer . <p> Determining a match . Labs conduct population studies based on samples from blood banks . That provides a database @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population . <p> Cellmark has 200-300 samples for the African-American population , taken from a blood bank in Detroit . Q : Are the statistical findings universally accepted ? <p> A : There is much debate among population geneticists over using probability rates based on a small sample limited to one geographic area and one racial or ethnic group . Some argue that there are variations within racial and ethnic groups that skew the odds of a coincidental match  --  a position Simpson 's defense is adopting . <p> The prosecution argues that statistical analyses are founded on basic mathematical principles . <p> For the more conclusive RFLP test , odds of a chance match ranges from one in more than 10,000 to one in hundreds of thousands or even millions . For PCR analysis , the range is about one in 100 to one in 2,000  --  leaving it wide open for the defense to argue that the probability of a coincidental match is high in a city of 3 million . Q : What 's the argument about in the Simpson trial ? <p> A : Everything . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gathering and storage of samples to the DNA laboratories ' past rate of errors , testing methods , statistical analysis . <p> Defense lawyers will also tell jurors that Cellmark made mistakes in two independent proficiency tests in 1988 and 1990  --  finding DNA in one mock crime scene sample when there was none . Cellmark says it has since changed procedures and corrected the problems . Cellmark will also flaunt its legal track record : courts tossed out their DNA results in only four of 330 cases since 1987 . Q : Where do California courts stand on DNA evidence ? <p> A : They 're divided . Two appeals courts have ruled DNA evidence is sound ; another said there is not enough agreement among scientists to allow DNA tests into evidence .
