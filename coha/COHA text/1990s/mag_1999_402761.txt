// It 's all too rare a pleasure when an amateur astronomer can directly compare his or her eyepiece observations with images taken by the world 's most powerful telescopes . Admittedly , planet aficionados enjoy a notable exception to this rule ; their targets are bright , yet small enough to fit within the narrow fields of view that are typical of superlative instruments like the Hubble Space Telescope and the Keck reflectors in Hawaii . But deep-sky observers specialize in dim , extended nebulae , whose subtleties often lie beyond the reach of the human eye . And of the nebulae that do stand out visually , many are too large for giant telescopes to capture in a single frame . So I hardly expected an electronic " photograph " from the Southern Hemisphere 's largest reflector to look strangely familiar . Yet that was exactly how I felt when I saw these composite-color views of the Dumbbell Nebula ( M27 in Vulpecula ) . They were taken last September by Unit Telescope 1 ( UT 1 ) , the first of four 8.2-meter reflectors destined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two properties of UT I 's Focal Reducer/LowDispersion Spectrograph  --  relatively " fast " optics and a wide field of view - enabled European Southern Observatory astronomers to capture in mere minutes the Dumbbell 's oxygen-rich outer envelope , with its tapered , oval appearance , and its nitrogen-rich innards , with their distinctive hourglass shape . These physically distinct ( albeit partially overlapping ) systems of rarefied gas remain subjects of active research . Yet they can be discerned visually with backyard telescopes . Of course , visual observers are unlikely to perceive the fine-scale details that UT 1 , with its computer-controlled primary mirror , handily resolved . Such details will enable astronomers to profile the numerous dark globules that pepper the nebula 's amorphous innards and to map compositional variations in the nebula 's ghostly gas . This should shed further light on the stellar death throes that create planetary nebulae . Both images here are composites of three individual frames taken through different filters . Two 5-minute exposures were obtained through filters that isolate emissions from oxygen ions ( here shown in green ) and hydrogen atoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30-second , blue-light exposure was taken to highlight numerous stars , only one of which - the star at the very center of the Dumbbell 's narrow waist - is physically related to the nebula . Although each color is reproduced roughly as it would appear to the human eye when seen in isolation , a spacefaring astronomer would see a view like this only through glasses that selected all three wavelengths at once . The images span 6.8 and 3.5 arcminutes , respectively , with north up and east to the left . Photograph // <p>
