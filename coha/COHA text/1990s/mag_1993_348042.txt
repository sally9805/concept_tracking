NINE DAYS OF SUSPENSE OVER THE MAKEUP OF RUSsia 's new government finally broke : President Boris Yeltsin 's key reformist ministers will keep their jobs after all . Yeltsin 's abrupt abandonment of his acting Prime Minister , free- market maven Yegor Gaidar , made the announcement a relief for those who feared that the Russian President was forsaking the country 's radical reform path altogether . Among the key players from the Gaidar team retaining their posts are Deputy Prime Ministers Alexander Shokhin and Anatoli Chubais . Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev was also kept on . No changes were announced in the key Interior , Defense and Security ministries . <P> With so little changed in the lineup , Yeltsin is bound to face more battles , with the conservative parliament , which marked its petulance by passing a law last week on government structure , rejecting the President 's request for ultimate executive authority . Under the circumstances , such legislation appeared little more than a reflection of reality .                @ @ @ @ @
