<p> Booker Lakes worked as a deputy sheriff and as a security guard for 15 years . <p> But what he really wanted was his own business , a family firm like his dad 's service station in St. Louis where Lakes worked pumping gas and fixing cars when he was growing up . <p> In December 1989 , Lakes took the leap , leaving behind his job as security manager at Fiesta Mart and plowing money he 'd socked away to found Comprehensive Investigations and Security . The Houston company provides armed and unarmed uniformed security officers and conducts private investigations . <p> Since then , Lakes and his wife , Kimberly , have expanded from operating out of their home to employing 80 workers and serving 35 customers . <p> " " That 's always been in my plans , " Lakes said of owning his own business .

The other top states were California ( 68,968 firms and receipts of $ 5.5 billion ) and New York ( 51,312 firms and receipts of $ 2.3 billion ) . <p> Fifty-six percent of the African-American firms nationwide had receipts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales of $ 1 million or more . <p> Unchanged from 1987 was the percentage of black-owned businesses .

In 1987 , Houston ranked No. 5 among cities nationwide in the number of black-owned firms . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders said the increase in black-owned firms was positive for the African-American business community , but others expressed doubt , citing a growing gap between receipts at black businesses and other firms . <p> Al Calloway , president of the predominantly black Houston Citizens Chamber of Commerce and a Houston City Council member until his terms ends Dec. 31 , cited the trend toward corporate downsizing . Blacks have been a big part of the trend in which employees being laid off are turning around and forming their own businesses , he said . <p> " " Some have started ( businesses ) after being laid off by taking skills they learned ( while on the job ) and putting them into entrepreneurship , " Calloway said . " " I think some of them are willing to take a risk because they are more knowledgeable " <p> " " Well , they do n't have a choice , " echoed Roy Douglas Malonson , founder and chairman of the Acres Home Citizens Chamber of Commerce . Downsizing is " " hitting us hard , " he said , adding " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living by going into their own businesses . " <p> The Acres Home chamber , which represents the 9.8-square-mile area in northwest Houston , has grown to more than 800 members since it was founded by Malonson seven years ago . <p> Most of those members are black-owned businesses that have been founded in the past five years or so , firms ranging from construction outfits to retail shops , said Malonson , who also serves as vice chairman of the Texas Association of African-American Chambers of Commerce . <p> However , Larry Hawkins , president of Unity National Bank , an independent bank in the city 's Third Ward , said he was concerned about numbers indicating black businesses could be slipping . <p> Hawkins pointed to the receipts of black-owned businesses , which averaged $ 52,000 per firm in 1992 , compared with $ 193,000 for all U.S.firms . <p> In 1987 , the average receipts at black-owned firms were $ 47,000 , while the average sales at all U.S. firms were $ 146,000 . This means the average black business 's receipts grew at a far slower rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting bigger , but our portion is getting smaller , " Hawkins said . " " Should we be concerned that we are slipping in terms of the overall economic picture ? " <p> Both Hawkins and Malonson are among the black businesses leaders who increasingly believe the answer to improving black businesses lies with black consumers , whom they call on to better support businesses in their communities . <p> Malonson also noted many new black-owned businesses may have failed , or have suffered " " rude awakenings . " Despite steps by banks to meet provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act and spread loans throughout the community , getting financing is still the biggest hurdle black entrepreneurs face , he said . <p> Nevertheless , Malonson claimed as a good sign the indications that more blacks are owning their own businesses , which he says provides them more control over their own destinies . <p> " " They are going into things that they feel they can control best , after having been in situations that other people controlled .
