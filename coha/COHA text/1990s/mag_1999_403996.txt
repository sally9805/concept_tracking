Here 's how to get the perfect fit on your bike // When the new bike frenzy is upon you , it 's easy to get hypnotized by all the shiny , high-zoot road and mountain bikes and overlook one crucial factor : proper bike fit . After all , no bike can perform to its potential if you wear it like a cheap suit . To help you guard against fit faux pas , we asked two Colorado bike shops-one road-oriented , one offroad-to explain their time-tested sizing methods . For those without similar expertise nearby , we include a " Do It Yourself " method where needed . Pro Peloton ( 303/415-1292 ) in bike-mad Boulder Colorado , is a high-end road shop . Owner lan Birlem is so passionate about proper sizing that he wo n't sell anything that does n't fit , even if customers request it . " Everyone has different cycling goals , flexibility and needs , " says Birlem , " and sometimes formulas do n't work . " As a result , he likes to put riders on a trainer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out by selecting a bike that 's close to the size the rider will need and mounts it on a trainer . Then he asks the rider to pedal easily and stop with the foot at the bottom of the stroke . Using a goniometer ( angle-measuring device ) , he determines the amount of bend in the knee , and adjusts seat height accordingly . The goal : 30-34 degrees . Photograph FIGURE A : SADDLE POSITIONING FIGURE B : REACH TO THE HANDLEBAR // DO IT YOURSELF Raise your saddle until your hips rock slightly when you pedal . Then lower the saddle just enough to eliminate the rocking . Record the distance from the pedal axle to the top of the saddle , and commit it to memory . Fore/aft saddle position and tilt With the bike in a trainer and seat height set correctly , stop pedaling when the crankarms are horizontal . A plumb line ( string and weight ) dropped from the front of the kneecap should touch the end of the crankarm ( Figure A ) . Slide the saddle forward or back on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fore/aft adjustments are correct , he uses a spirit level to be sure the top of the saddle is horizontal . DO IT YOURSELF Ask a friend to drop the plumb line as described . Tip : Some riders like to tilt the nose of the saddle down slightly ( 1-2 degrees ) to avoid numbness in the nether regions . Reach to the handlebar There 's no formula for this-Birlem has the customer ride the bike for at least 15 minutes , making sure the rider is comfortable with no sharp bend in the back . " Most road bikes are set up for a stretched out racer , " says Birlem . " But each year I suggest a more upright position that uses spacers in the headset , a frame with a shorter top tube or a stem with rise . " DO IT YOURSELF While looking down with hands on the brake hoods , the handlebar should obscure the front hub or fall slightly in front of it ( Figure B ) . If you ca n't achieve this with a normal , 8- to 12-cm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or longer top tube . Another gauge : With hands on the handlebar drops , there should be about a 1-cm gap between the elbow and the knee at their closest point . Frame size Birlem checks frame size after he has established seat position and reach . With these parameters set correctly his goal is to have 11-14 cm of the round part of the seatpost sticking out of the frame . Also , the vertical difference between the top of the saddle and the top of the stem should be 7-9 cm for racers and 0-4 cm for everyone else ( see " Frame size " photo next page ) . If the frame is too small , it will be hard to raise the stem sufficiently . Consequently , Birlem has gone to larger frames with shorter top tubes to fit many of his customers . Cleat alignment Birlem seats the rider on a table with the lower legs hanging straight down . He checks how the feet naturally align-toes in , toes out , or straight ahead-then duplicates these angles when he installs cleats . Fore/aft cleat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ball of the foot ( widest portion of the shoe ) .

Keep in mind that most current clipless pedal systems have 5-10 degrees of " float , " allowing your heel to move laterally . Position your cleat so the foot is positioned in the middle of this range ( Figure C ) . The same technique works off road . Photograph // <p>
