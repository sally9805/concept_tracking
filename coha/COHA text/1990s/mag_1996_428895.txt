Since the game 's earliest days , baseball 's best hitters have been searching for a cure for the dips , wiggles , squiggles and drops of the breaking ball // Psst , did you notice Tony Gwynn was in a slump ? Of course it 's the sort of slump for which most hitters in baseball would trade shoe endorsements ( .338 is worth a shoe company to some ) , but it 's enough to drive Gwynn , a supreme perfectionist when it comes to twirling bats , nuts . What slump ? How about a three-week slide from an average in the mid .370s down tn to the infernal .330s ? In the skid . which also included a skid onto the disabled list , everything went wrong , Gwynn says , from the way he saw the ball , the way he stepped into it , to the way he hit it . But because he knows line drives the way Bill Gates does hard drives , he knows what went wrong and when . It was a game against the Mets on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , was a game full of little off-speed breaking pitches when he was looking for fastballs . Though Gwynn has more than handied the breaking pitch throughout his career , this rare midseason skid points up one of the hoariest challenges any hitter faces whether he is just starting out or whether , like Tony Gwynn , he has won six National League batting titles : How do you hit a breaking pitch anyway ? The answers are as different as they are surprising . The curveball-the original breaking ball-has been around almost from the dawn of the game . A pitcher in the 1860s named Candy Cummings is reputed to have invented the pitch by transposing to a baseball what he picked up from flipping wobbly clamshells into New York Harbor . Cummings described his glee at seeing what happened to batters when he finally got around to throwing his discovery pitch in a game : " I began to watch the flight of the ball through the air , and distinctly saw it curve , " he said , " a surge of joy flooded over me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surged through batters ' minds and hearts have also been unforgettable . " The first time I saw the pitch , I ducked , " says veteran Alan Trammell , " and the first time I saw it in a big league game I ducked again . Bert Blyleven threw me a curveball in spring training in my first year and down I went . The umpire went , Strike , ' and I said , I 'm in for it . ' " be breaking ball has been breaking batters ' minds and careers forever . Jimmie Reese , the late fungo wizard of the Angels who briefly was Babe Ruth 's roommate on the Yankees , once was asked why he lasted three seasons in the big leagues . " Simple , " he said , with a modest shrug , " the curveball . " The difficulty of hitting a breaking pitch seems obvious . The thing comes at you like a misfired rocket then , just as you 're backpedaling , bailing or eating dirt , changes direction , as though receiving a midcourse correction and swoops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Photograph Simply splendid : Williams , a master at handling the breaking pitch , had the sort of X-ray eye where he could reduce what he saw not only to angles , but also degrees of angles . // TV cameras have made the pitch seem both less and more than what it really is . A big breaking ball on the home screen-especially from the center field camera-looks like a slithering loop of spaghetti ; from a slomo angle off the plate it seems more like a jaywalker moving slowly into a traffic lane , asking to be hit . What neither angle takes into account is the pace of the ball-the change of speed off the fastball-and the suddenness of the break itself . A really good curveball does not curve , it snaps . The cliche is that it rolls off a table , the reality is that it can produce laughs , slumps and one-way tickets to new professions . If hitting is timing and pitching is upsetting timing , then the breaking pitch-even more than the change ( because it is so basic ) - is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the game 's dominant breaking pitch . It has since been joined by the slider , the spitter , the forkball , the knuckle-curve , the fosh , the fish , and whatever is wet , cut , sanded , scraped and greased . " The breaking pitch " is that much tougher because it can break so many different ways . But the basic challenge for a hitter remains the same as in the days of Candy Cummings : How to hang in there and , with control , do something with that fandango. ed Williams once described how he handled the breaking pitch : ' ' " The first time up , I tried to hit the middle of the baseball . If I grounded out , then the next time up I tried to hit the bottom of the baseball . If I grounded out again , then " he said , sounding either like Bill Murray or a Zen master , " I tried to hit the baseball under the baseball . " Williams , of course , had the sort of X-ray eye where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also to degrees of angles . Fastballs , he knew , dipped ( they did not rise ) 4.5 to 5 degrees , and curveballs came down into the strike zone ( or below ) at angles of 10 to 15 degrees . All a batter needed to do was get his bat into the " impact zone " of the plate by adjusting his swing within four-tenths of a second from the time a ball left a pitcher 's hand . " He had good eyesight , " Ken Griffey Jr . deadpans . But Junior 's joy in hitting has not yet extended to a joy in talking about what he does . " I see it , and I hit it , that 's all , " he says . " I do n't look for a specific pitch ever , I 've never been afraid to be hit by the ball , but most of the time I face righthanders so that does n't even figure in . I just see it and hit it . " Griffey 's manager , Lou Piniella , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at a time when sliders and other breakers were added to pitchers ' repertoires , thought he knew why Griffey brought a little more to the breaking pitch than impulse . " He hits off the fastball , " Piniella says , " and when he has that timed he makes adjustments to the breaking ball . " There was more . " He also sees the spin on it . That is everything . " Seeing the spin on the ball allows a hittertheoretically-to tell just what kind of pitch is coming . An overhand curveball spins one way , a slider another , a forkball and splitter differently than those . But the idea of being able to see spin at all is controversial . Among hitters , it is roughly akin to the capacity among the faithful to see mystical tears and drops of blood . Wade Boggs is a devout . He sees spinand more . " You have to recognize a pitch before you start to swing , " he says , " You can do it by picking up the spin . Curveballs change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dot right in the middle of them . " The dot in the middle of the slider , like the rising fastball , is one of the game 's great mysteries-or realities . Photograph SOME LIKE IT DOT : Johnson ( above left ) may be one of the masters at throwing a breaking ball , but Boggs says he can hit anyone because he sees the spin on the ball so well it has a little dot in the middle of it . // " Boggs is full of it , " Gwynn says . " I 've heard that a thousand times , and I 've never seen it . I 'm still waiting . And my eyesight is pretty good . " Last time anyone checked , Gwynn 's eyesight , which used to be 20-10 , was 20-15 . But Mark McGwire , who has never had Gwynn 's eye or sense of visual acuity , is a Boggsian all the way . He sees dots , too . " Yes , yes , that 's right , " he says , " I see that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up different spins . " It 's all in the rotation and who the particular pitcher is . If the pitcher has an " up ' curveball , you see a little hump on it , see it humpin ' up , it has a different plane on it , it goes up , and then it drops . When you see some kind of slurve , it 's more from the side down and a slider is ... a hard slider is where it gets the dot . " Get it ? If batters sound as if they are speaking in tongues , it 's no wonder . Whatever show of bravado they make , however dotty they get in talking about it , most hitters do not relish the idea of hitting a good breaking-ball pitcher . A hitter must be able to handle a fastball if he expects to make it at the major league level . But a breaking pitch may be the hardest pitch of all to hit There are some courageous souls among the brethren who will flat out confess it is actually not possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very few , and you can ask anybody , " Trammell says , " who can hit them . Ask guys like Wade Boggs , any of those guys : They do n't hit real good breaking balls , they hit the mistakes , the spinners that stay up in the middle of the plate . There 's a big difference . Nobody hits a Randy Johnson , a Steve Carlton , a Ron Guidry . Is it true , is it possible , have we all been brought up misplacing our dread in the 95mph heater rather than in the 82-mph hook ? On the surface , Boggs shrugs off Trammell . " You can hit a really good breaking-ball pitcher , " he says matter-of-factly , but then pauses , and adds , somewhat more soberly , " The hard part about that is that a breaking ball can break so far that you have to have such good eye-hand coordination to center it Sometimes you top it , sometimes you do n't hit it square , but you can do it " ther than hitting mistakes , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do to handle the satanic variety of dips , wiggles , squiggles and drops ? ' lhe answers in terms of physics and mechanics are predictable if inescapable . A hitter must be able to stay back long enough to be able to pick up the break on a pitch , adjust to it and then bring his bat through the hitting zone to make contact , or in Boggs ' words , to " center it . " Photograph Practiceme makes perfect : Piazza , who leads the NIL in hitting , is a good example of how good breaking-ball hitters are made , not born . // Hitters use different devices and strategies to train themselves to stav back . The great Japanese slugger Sadaharu Oh was baffled by breaking pitches until he trained himself to stand back on one leg , flamingo style , before striding forward . The extra split second he gained enabled him not to commit too soon . The Mariners ' Edgar Martinez , as good a breaking-ball hitter as there is in the game today , also trained himself to stay back using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hero of his , Jose Cruz . The Yankees ' Bernie Williams makes a conscious effort to keep his hands back as his body comes forward . As a switch hitter , he sees breaking pitches that nearly always bore into him rather than at him and away . He says he attacks the pitch more aggressively from the right side-his natural sideand " more mechanically " from the left . The Dodgers " Mike Piazza , the N.L 's leading hitter at the moment , says repetition is the way he learned to stay back . The first time he saw a good breaking ball was in college , and he was not prepared for it " I hit the breaking ball pretty good in high school-because I had never really seen a good one . But then when I was a freshman in college , a senior threw me a curveball my first at-bat , and I was really shocked . I could n't imagine hitting that pitch , especially after he threw me his fastball . It was an eye-opening experience in more ways than one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went " back to the drawing board , " working with a pitching machine that threw " the hardest , ugliest breaking balls there were . I tried to get it as ugly as possible " til I got to the point that the guy on the mound was n't any uglier than the machine . " The key word is repetition . Hitters want to repeat what is successful , whether they are , like Yankee Paul O'Neill and Griffey , hitters who " see it and hit it , " or who , like Boggs and Gwynn , have made philosophies worthy of medieval scholastics . Boggs says the key to his mechanics is the " wait-weight " theory , staying back long enough , then making the correct weight shift forward , never trying to do too much with a pitch , always willing to go up the middle or the other way . He says the goal is " to glide into a ball " so that his weight shift is smooth , his forward landing soft rather than jerky . Hitters divide over whether they " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitters talk about the advantage of knowing what a pitcher throws . Trammell says he would rather " face a Randy Johnson or a Roger Clemens than some pitcher I do n't know because I have a memory bank , and I will better be able to recognize the ball out of his hand . " Recognizing the ball at the point of release is another critical component . That , rather than spin , is what Gwynn is looking for . Some batters can pick up quirky little movements such as the way the hand comes out of the glove or the angle of wrist when the ball is released ( a fastball is released with the wrist showing flat to a hitter , breaking pitches often will be released with a side angle showing or with a funny little twist of the wrist coming over the top ) . " When you 're really hot , " McGwire says , " you always see the ball better out of the guy 's hand . " // So you want to hit a hit a breaking ball ... // Hitters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Dodgers ' Eric Karros , who would rather hit a fastball , says , " If a guy 's throwing a good breaking pitch , you 're in trouble . But the chances are you wo n't see three good breaking pitches over the plate in one at-bat . So you set guys up that way to get the pitch you want . " Piazza , who prefers to take pitchers deep into the count so he can see what they are throwing , says , " It 's essential that you recognize those first couple of pitches and try to feel out what the pitcher is trying to do to you up there . If he 's throwing fastballs early in the count , you know you 're eventually going to see a breaking ball-and so you get ready for it . If he 's flipping you breaking balls , he 's eventually going to try to sneak one by you . " The beauty in all this , however , is not confined to mechanics , memory and strategic planning . Hitting the breaking pitch , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The skills involved are a secret dialogue between mind and body in the person of a single hitter . The dialogue is as unique as the hitter and often begins in childhood . When he was a kid in Omaha , Boggs played corkball , a game popular in the Midwest and Far West . He is sure it was instrumental in learning how to handle a breaking pitch . " The ball jumped and dipped , did all kinds of things , and it allowed me to have much quicker handeye coordination than I ever might have had , " he savs . McGwire says playing childhood games of table tennis and trying to whack Nerf balls and Wiffle balls in his back yard helped him . " Ping-Pong lets you see balls coming at you fast with all kinds of spins on it , Wiffle balls and Nerf balls go all over the place , and you have to adjust really quickly . " Jim Kaat and Piniella , talking about breaking-ball hitters of the past , come to a mild consensus that Tony Oliva might have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Oliva 's in Minnesota . " Most kids here come up seeing the fastball , " Kaat says , " but Oliva grew up in Cuba where his dad worked with him using these little paper balls ; these balls would dip and dive all over the place . When Oliva began playing here , ( Harmon ) Killebrew and ( Bob ) Allison would tell him what the pitcher was throwing , but he 'd just go up there and hit like he had seen it all before . " It is hard to see inside a hitter 's mind , far easier to become absorbed in mechanics . But mechanics and mind go hand in hand . Martinez regularly works off a batting tee . Anyone who goes to the ballpark early will see him patiently standing in place off to the side of the batting cage , taking cut after cut at baseballs propped up knee high , smashing them into netting in front of him . Physical repetition is only part of what this drill is all about " I work on my timing , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look , it 's very hard to explain , but this works for me mentally ; it might not work for another player . Rhythm is so essential for me . You have to be in sync with the pitcher 's windup and delivery , you have to be moving with him . I work and work with the tee until I get this feel ... it 's a mental thing . " he game 's long-standing breaker of breaking pitches , its master of hooks , heat , junk and everything else is Gwynn . Rhythm-which he calls pace-is his key word , too . It is what he lost in that game against the Mets , he says , and what he has been seeking to recover . " You need to have rhythm , you want to have pace , and that pace dictates how well or how poorly you swing the bat , " Gwynn says . Voluble , a pleasantly roundish man , looking more like a Buddha than a batter , he suddenly begins to snap his fingers as he talks , amid the noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of airplanes overhead . " It 's the hardest thing to explain ( snap , snap ) , " he says . " One at-bat , just one bad atbat-like I had against ( Jason ) Isringhausen a couple of weeks ago-can throw you off ( snap , snap ) . I snap my fingers like that because that 's kind of like the pace I want to have when I 'm hitting . When I 'm doing things good , it happens at that pace , but when you get out of rhythm , there 's no flow ... you 're just up there swinging , trying to make something happen instead of letting it happen . " Gwynn 's description of who he is and what he does as a hitter is a valedictory , a seeming summation of what everyone else who has swung a bat has gone through learning to hit . He says the secret of early hand-eye coordination in his case came through playing basketball . He was a point guard through high school and college ( San Diego State , where he still holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as meticulous about the " science " of hitting as Ted Williams . Like Williams , he believes a hitter 's first obligation is to know himself , know his strengths and weaknesses , and then to work endlessly and meticulously to get better . When he first came into the league-like Trammell-he ducked when he saw a good curveball. * 1ou got to have experience . You got to see that pitch again and again , see it coming at your head and ducking and flinch ing and seeing it break over the plate " til experience tells you , nine times out of 10 , it 's a curveball , it moves a certain way . Experience teaches you to have faith in what you 're seeing , " he insists-as zealously as Boggs . Gwynn long ago realized he was going to see a steady diet of breaking pitches , so he trained his body to work in a certain way . " I 've played long enough to know I 'm going to see a lot of changeups , a lot of breaking pitches , forkballs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gear yourself , " he says . " So for me , the biggest things , the constants , especially lefty against lefty , are first , you have to keep your front shoulder in-if your front shoulder flies , you 're dead , you ca n't hit A second constant is that when I take my stride , I want to land soft on my front foot . If I 've done those two things right , then I have the opportunity to hit because I 've landed in a good position , everything is closed the way it 's supposed to be , and it 's just a matter of taking the bat through the zone . " Gwynn , as rigorously as a penitent , has taught himself to stay closed , to stay back , to wait for the rewards of coming forward . He consciously tries to hit the opposite way . Like a classic contact hitter , he never tries to overpower a pitch and uses batting practice to perfect his stroke to left-because it allows him the longest possible waiting time at the plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirrors , does use mirrors . Like Sadaharu Oh and many Japanese hitters , he poses in front of a full-length body mirror . He 's checking to see if there are any subtle variations in his stance that might throw him off in a game . " When I look in a mirror , I am looking to be sure my front shoulder is closed , that I 'm coming out soft , that my hands are back . I am looking to see my rhythm . When I have my rhythm , " he says , " if someone was standing in front of me-the pitcher-he would see three letters of my name on the back of my jersey . " And if he was not in his rhythm ? ' ' " They would see nothing at all . " Like Williams and Boggs , Gwynn is a supremely confident hitter . He does not see spots before his eyes , but he aims for parts of the baseball , like Williams . Alone among the players talked to for this story , Gwynn did not seem either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the ball under the ball . " I go for the top half of the ball myself , especially on breaking pitches , " he says . " I do n't want to elevate because I 'm not a fly-ball hitter , I 'm a ground-ball hitter . And so when I go up to the plate , I 'm thinking I want to hit the top half of the baseball . " Gwynn is not afraid to hit the ball on the ground : He actually wants to do that . He disagrees with Trammell that it is impossible to hit a good breaking pitch . Not only that , he hits the pitch by going after the top half of the ball . He is that sure of himself . But as supremely confident as he is , he is , like any perfectionist , supremely tormented . He works endlessly to keep his magical rhythm . He spends hours at the tee , watching video , studying the idiosyncrasies of pitchers that will give him an advantage in his next atbat . And when things break down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When things go off , I really start to drive my video machine and my family crazy , " he says . " You know I start rewinding my machine at home , again and again . I put it into slo-mo . I tell them , See , I 'm doing the same thing over and over again . ' My 13-year-old son says , Hey , Dad , why do n't you correct that ? ' I tell him , Anthony , that 's the whole point , I ca n't correct it , I 've been working at it , I 've been trying to correct it . ' He says , Well , all you have to do is keep your head back . ' I tell him , Yeah , I know that , but I ca n't do it ! ' And I drive him nuts . " And he drives his teammates crazy , too , he says , " and none of them want to hear it . They 'll nod their heads , and you know they 're thinking , Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moaning about it , give us a break . ' So what do you do ? People like me and Boggs can cry on each other 's shoulders for hours , and it does no good at all . It 's a personal thing , " Gwynn says , half-demented , half-filled with Buddha wisdom . " The thing I hate is mistakes , I ca n't take them , so you know I 'm going to work and work " til I get through it " He sits back in the dugout . There is a halfsmile on his face , playful and distant curious for a man in pain , and you somehow sense he is now fully locked onto whatever gods of hitting he lives with , the ones who torment him but who have for so long amply rewarded him , who years ago , claimed him as one of their own . He mentions retirement It is a fly he brushes away . He is going better now than he has in the past three or four years . He has bumped his lifetime average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hitting .400 ( .394 in 1994 ) than anyone since Williams did it in 1941 . No , it is not age that eats at him now . It is that specific , impossible-to-describe inner zone that a game of breaking balls robbed him of weeks before . He spends his time at the tee and at batting practice-which he regards as more pressure-packed than the game itself , because it is there that he knows he will-or will not-locate his stroke again . The real secret for him , all along , has been that torment , whatever it was that began when he first ducked at a pitch that broke over the plate , is something he cherishes because it drives him back to his craft . " Yeah , they tell you , " Shut up , stop complaining , stop going on about how you 're messing up . ' But see , to me , that 's part of the fun , " Gwynn says . The best part of all is going up there and working it out . Oh , it 's easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , when you suck , that 's when you have to work it out . The batting coach will stand there and tell you , Oh , it 's good , it 's good , ' and it 's not , so you keep going after it . I 'll tell him , It just does n't feel right . ' To me , you see , it 's all about feel . When you have that feel in your body , when you have that pace , I do n't have to ask anyone what I 'm doing because I know , I know . When you get into that place , no one has to tell you anything . " The roar of a plane overhead shakes the air ; the evening 's opposition , the Mets , come traipsing in from batting practice , Gwynn 's teammates take the field with chatter and clatter , music blaring from scoreboard loudspeakers . Gwynn spreads his arms out across the back of the dugout bench for a moment , staring at the field . From the look on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him at that moment is the missing snap , snap ' he had been joyfully , painfully in search of for the past month . Photograph Rhythm and blues : Gwynn-before he went on the disabled list-struggled to recapture his rhythm , spending hours at the tee and watching videos of himself and opposing pitchers .
