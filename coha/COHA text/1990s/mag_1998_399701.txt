There is simply no justice . Why should you , a hardcore , charismatic cyclist , have to be handicapped with a beater bike when the major bike companies have warehouses bulging with gear that they have to give away if they ca n't sell it ? The truth is , if you had a Cannondale Super V 4000 , Schwinn Homegrown or VooDoo D-Jab , you 'd kick major booty . That 's why that 53rd-place finish in your Hometown Grinder hurts so bad . With the right bike , you coulda won . You know it . We know it . The world knows it . Now , if some company would come to its senses about your unlocked potential and just give you a bike ( and , oh , $5,000 ) , you could quit your job and ride from sea to shining sea . Publicity ? No problem . You 'll tell anyone who 'll listen what a great bike you 're riding , what a great company built it , what a great sport this is , yada yada yada . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone and call Cannondale , Giant , Schwinn , Specialized , or ( if you 've got a chest covered in colorful tattoos ) VooDoo ? Not so fast . If you want free bike stuff ( also known as swag , schwag or chi-chis ) , better get your story straight before the marketing director picks up the phone . Everyone wants a deal Major bike companies receive thousands of queries a year from charities , benefit rides , churches , race promoters looking for prizes , grade-school smart-alecks and 40-year-old sport racers , all promising to take blood tests , lie-detector tests and oaths of fealty for the chance at a free ride . // John Pavlat , national sales manager of VooDoo Cycles , claims , " At least ten percent of my time is spent dealing with requests for free gear . " Multiply the roughly 1,000 queries the typical marketing director receives in a year by the average four minutes it takes to answer the phone , scan an e-mail or read a letter-and we 're talking serious timesuck . A picture emerges : a sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Armstrong , director of media relations at Cannondale , says , " It 's unfortunate , but my business card should read , ' Just Say No ! ' I refer to unsolicited queries as the great black hole of sponsorship . ' We throw product in and nothing ever comes back out . " He recalls one young married couple who volunteered for the Peace Corps . " They were on their way to Africa , desperately needed bikes for transportation and promised me photos , which I wanted to use in our catalog . But once they got the bikes I never heard from them again . " Steve Blick , media liaison at GT Bicycles , is admittedly jaded but continues to answer every request . He says , " We 're looking for a partnership with a rider , not a schwagmeister . " Rather unusual requests It 's not just the regular joes begging for schwag who give marketing flacks the occasional bout of Tourette 's Syndrome . Requests from the weird , the bad and the ugly also present a major problem . Jim Simmons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call from a guy who wanted a sweet new bike to accessorize his customized truck for a car show . " He was so inarticulate , " says Simmons , " that I could barely understand what he was saying , let alone how Giant could possibly benefit from having one of our high-end bikes strapped to his beat-up truck . " VooDoo 's Pavlat is constantly approached by colorful knobheads who eagerly strip off their socks , lift their jerseys or pull down their shorts to display VooDoo 's sunburst logo . " Check out my Voodoo tattoo , " they say hopefully . " Dude , can I get a free bike ? " Lori Ipsen of Specialized is puzzled by the number of letters from prison inmates requesting bike catalogs . She wonders : just wishful thinking , or perhaps the first step in a planned jail break ? And if so , by sending a free catalog , could she then be charged later as an accessory ? " Crazed but remarkably well-equipped cyclists break out of Attica . News at eleven . " " People are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gregg Bagni , Schwinn 's marketing director . " One woman wanted a new Paramount and two-thousand bucks for a charity ride . I gave her twenty dollars out of my own pocket to sponsor her-but no bike . " And a Knievel wannabe wanted to jump a new Schwinn across fourteen flaming automobiles , he adds . Fate slapped one of the more unusual requests on Armstrong 's desk . A man claiming to be Jesus Christ reborn respectfully requested a Cannondale to ride across the country preaching the word of , well , himself . " I was tempted to do it , " Armstrong admits . " If it was true , you could n't pray for a better endorsement than , ' God says Cannondale makes the best bikes . ' " Charity does n't pay You may be doing something for a good cause , but you 're just one of a million other " saints " out there doing the same thing . ( After all , it 's a bit mercenary to use a charity ride as an excuse to get schwagged . Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consciences are out to lunch . ) Says Armstrong , " Though I do view charitable requests sympathetically , because of the sheer volume of calls and letters I get I have to say no to all but a few . " Simmons takes a slightly different approach . " A woman approached me about a charity ride , " he remembers . " She sent me a picture of the Giant bike she had ridden for the past seven years . In this case , she was a loyal customer doing something for the community . We got her a bike . " Even if you 're a loyal customer with an exceptionally good cause , think about how best to present it . Phone calls do n't work . A professional-looking proposal might . " The letters I receive asking for equipment are awful , " says Simmons . " I 've gotten notes on cocktail napkins and proposals on spiral-notebook paper in pencil . If you want a chance , state what kind of successes you 've had , what kind of person you are and how we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read . " What works , sort of ... Do n't despair . Getting stuff for free takes a lot of effort . Tip : Riding across the country is not nearly as impressive as it was in 1976 . " I want to experience the U.S. and write a book " is a yawner today . " Most adventurers think that once they get on a bike and start out from L.A. to New York the sponsorships and TV networks are going to flock in , " says Bagni . Schwinn did give a single-speed cruiser to a guy who rode across America last year in jeans and a T-shirt , staying in hotels and dining on steak and beer . " He actually rode the cruiser across America , " Bagni recalls , " and earned remarkably good press . " ( " Shiftless Characters , " Shorts , March . ) Sometimes you simply have to suffer ( and we 're not talking sore quads after a tough climb ) . Specialized 's Ipsen once received a newspaper article from a man describing how his apartment building had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gear . Ipsen went through the company 's outdated inventory and sent him a helmet , shoes and some cycling clothes . " It 's catch as catch can , " she says . " We ca n't cover everything , but when we know it 's legitimate , we try . " ( And no , dousing your old bike with gas then torching it does n't count . ) Going on an expedition is the current " hot " idea , especially if you 're wired into the World Wide Web . Whereas riding crosscountry was once considered a testament to your stamina , bike teams today are circumnavigating the Mediterranean , retracing Marco Polo 's route and pedaling from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego . All on free bikes ? Well , not often . Sure schwag Fame is a big incentive for a bike company to schwag the daylights out of you . GT 's Blick has heaped bikes on rock bands , Indy-car drivers , hockey players and supercross champions . Cannondale built a custom rig for basketball star Shaquille O'Neal-a freakish 34-inch mountain bike . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , giving Shaq a bike was a great way to advertise how versatile our design process is , " says Blick . If you do race and are humping for sponsorship , your best chance is to interest a local dealer in your results and get the dealer to place the call to the manufacturer . Bike companies love shop-supported grass-roots racing programs . " I regard people seeking sponsorship as people applying for a job , " says VooDoo 's Pavlat . " The better the resume , the better chance you have of being hired . " Reality is your friend Be realistic . Do n't assume that just because you beat Ned Overend 's third cousin in a race when he was sick with the flu , you 're set for life . Manufacturers use sponsorship of riders as advertising , public relations and product testing all rolled into one . " We give a better mousetrap to riders who can speak to its strengths and weaknesses , " says Simmons . " We 're not looking for people with a Dennis Rodman , inyour-face attitude . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ( Of course , signing on as an editor for a national cycling magazine is another high-schwag option , but we do n't recommend it . Who wants to work that hard ? ) <p>
