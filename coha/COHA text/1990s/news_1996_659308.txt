<p> Maurice Glass walked down Broadway Street , once a thriving part of this city across the bay from San Francisco and now a wasteland of boarded-up windows and empty lots that serve as evidence of the forgotten inner city . <p> Glass , a retired Oakland resident , did n't get very far before finding something new - a Sears , Roebuck and Co. store , the first this town has seen since the retailer pulled out in 1993 . <p> " It seems like they 're investing in the inner cities again , " said Glass , a former Sears employee , as he looked at ties and slacks in the new store . " I tell you , I know we need them - and they 're beginning to realize they need us . " <p> From the major retailer to the regional grocer to automobile and boat dealers , companies are becoming aware of the value and potential rewards of targeting the minority consumer . <p> Population statistics , street signs , even an infusion of exotic restaurants , point to the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosperous . The melting pot is constantly simmering , and companies are scrambling to get their share of the stew . <p> Some say it 's about time . <p> " There was a sense of abandonment when Sears and other retailers pulled out , " said Oakland Mayor Elihu Harris . <p> " You can see from the crowds here that they 've been looking for this , and I think it shows there is a real underserved retail market . I would think that logic alone would dictate that you come and service that market and reap the profits that come with it , " he said . <p> Sears opened seven new stores in that same day in the San Francisco and Los Angeles areas , complementing a return to the inner cities that includes recent store openings in the New York City borough of Queens and in San Antonio , Texas . <p> Like other companies , Sears is finding the money is there for the taking . The nation 's black and Hispanic populations are becoming more affluent , recent studies found , with a combined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white spending in such areas as cars , children 's clothing and perishable foods . <p> The increased buying power is expected to become more pronounced in coming years as those minority segments , which typically produce larger families , grow faster than the general population . <p> Now , companies are looking anew at markets where they once said they could n't make any money . While the trend is attributed in part to falling real estate prices that make doing business in inner cities more attractive , there 's more to it than that . <p> " Downtown had been left behind by a lot of people , in fact , left behind by us , " said Sears chairman Arthur C. Martinez . " Our approach is , as we look at the growing multicultural , multiethnic character of America , we want to do business with all those customers . They 've got just as much buying power as whites in suburbia . " <p> And minorities generally tend to be more brand-loyal , which would benefit businesses that move quickly to embrace them , said Ken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that tracks black consumer marketing and media . <p> " For those companies who court black consumers with advertising and special acknowledgment , that rare recognition always pays off in long-term patronage , " Smikle said . <p> Many companies in recent years have gotten savvy about so-called niche marketing . J.C . Penney , Spiegel , Avon , Hanes and others now have products and catalogs tailored specifically to minority shoppers . Automobile , boat and food companies are advertising on predominately black and Hispanic television and radio stations , and banks are teaming with supermarket chains to open branches in inner-city neighborhoods where both once refused to tread . <p> Not only are companies coming back , they 're portraying their return as a win-win situation for the community and the business . Many talk about a new commitment to the communities they had abandoned and ask for minority consumers ' commitment to them . <p> " Companies are realizing there are a lot of Good Samaritan aspects by returning to the inner cities , and some are even wondering why they did n't do it sooner , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University . " It helps revive a community by adding energy and a spark , but it 's also a very lucrative opportunity . <p> " And many companies now realize to get loyal customers and keep them is more important than trying to find new customers , " she said . <p> It 's the individual touches that seem to matter most for success , urban experts and marketing people say . <p> Sears , for example , sells a line of clothes called African Village that are designed specifically for black women , with larger sizes and brighter colors . Merchandise at some stores also is tailored to meet the needs of the majority of the clientele , which might include smaller sizes for Hispanic and Asian women and rice cookers for populations with a heavy Vietnamese presence . <p> Others are going even further . Dollar General Corp . recently worked with the Columbia , S.C. , Housing Authority to open a third store near a public housing project , with residents working in those stores . The Nashville , Tenn. - based chain also requires public housing residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Our whole company culture is enhanced by these things , " said Cal Turner , the company 's chairman . <p> Doing more now might provide for a bigger payoff down the road . The Census Bureau projects the minority population will grow at a much faster rate than the white population through the year 2020 . <p> The agency said whites by far will make up the largest number of Americans , although not as big a percentage as they do now . The percentage of the population that is white will shrink by 2020 to 78.2 percent from 83.3 percent . <p> Immigration and rapid population growth are expected to make Hispanics the nation 's largest minority totaling 15.7 percent of the population . Blacks will be the second largest minority at 13.9 percent , with Asians and Pacific Islanders at 6.9 percent . <p> Targeting minority markets is a learning experience for many Fortune 500 companies . Many stereotypes have been proven wrong , particularly about theft and a lack of work ethic in hiring people from the neighborhood , corporate executives say . Even commonly held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vary . <p> To help correct those mistakes , companies such as Colgate-Palmolive Co. , Ford Motor Co. and The Quaker Oats Co. , often turn to advertising firms that specialize in marketing to blacks , Hispanics and Asians . <p> The changing face of America also has executives scrambling to train minorities for jobs in the 21st century . In Illinois , executives from AT &T; and Ameritech Corp . sit on a committee examining ways to keep students in high school and to interest them in high-technology fields . <p> Bozell Worldwide , the advertising firm , has formed a partnership with Chicago sports and entertainment marketer Stedman Graham to target the $ 324 billion black consumer market . The partnership , Graham Gregory Bozell , hopes to not only target blacks for marketing , but train them with the help of black businesses and colleges to enter mainstream jobs . <p> Headline : What businesses are doing to win more of the minority consumer market <p> Store openings ... <p> Sears , Roebuck and Co. set up branches in the Los Angeles and San Francisco areas , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
