If the ' 80s were about trading up , the ' 90s are about putting down roots  --  literally . Retail garden sales are up 34% since 1988 , to $20 billion . Last year botanical parks drew 52 million visitors , four times as many people as pro football . One reason : gardens boost home values around 10% . Draw inspiration from newly regional forms  --  the desert plan shown here , or the varied showplaces on pages 146 to 151 . And see our advice on page 153 on how you can garden smarter . The garden is no longer limited to close-cropped lawn , unquenchable thirst and a nasty addiction to chemicals . Five years ago , John and Melody Taft , a filmmaker and an artist who live near desert-like Ojai , Calif. , spent $6,000 for cacti and succulents . Since then , the plants have doubled in size and quadrupled in value . The oasis needs watering just once or twice a year . Aloes add color , from yellow to deep red . Strong shapes come from sculptural cacti such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexican golden barrels ( along the path ) . Early on , friends donated plants ; the Tafts pass on seedlings now . Newcomers , take note : gardeners often share their horticultural wealth ( and knowledge ) with neighbors . For most urban areas , the plain grass patch is giving way to more enlightened forms . You can pay a pro upwards of $4,000 a year to produce the show  --  or , like pediatrician Frank Stroud , who tends his garden in historic Georgetown in Washington , D.C. ( right ) , you can take matters into your own hands . " I daddle in the garden when I do n't need to be there , " Stroud admits . " My wife says it 's therapy . " Annual investment : about 200 hours of labor , plus $2,000 for new plants , mainly annuals . And while his romantic corner evokes an English estate , Washington 's hot summers and Stroud 's free time dictate a less demanding style . A decade ago , for instance , he abandoned formal rosebeds for purple lythrum and easygoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Shasta daisies . " They all galloped away on me , " he brags , " which is nice when you 're trying to fill space . " Overall , Stroud is content with his returns : " A plant I buy for $1.25 in April is still giving me pleasure in November , " he says . " That 's a great investment . " Diane and David Dalton bought this two-acre Chestnut Hill , Mass. property in 1980 . Since then , they 've put in more than 3,000 varieties of plants , working regularly with Allen Haskell , a respected horticulturalist , and a full-time gardener . Yet Diane Dalton ( at left with her cat Junior , who rates his own catnip bed ) is sympathetic to the concerns of gardeners with more modest resources . Her advice : start slowly . You need n't create the entire garden in a single season . " Pick one project  --  a rock garden , perhaps , or a border  --  and do just that very well . " In her garden , Dalton is committed to perennials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread by themselves , " she explains , " so there 's no need to spend a small fortune on plants . " For shady spots , she likes a profusion of hostas and ferns . For sunnier locales , her favorites include yellow daylilies , rhododendrons and asaleas . " All those plants are pretty much surefire , " says Dalton . " With minimum care and expense , you will go on enjoying them for years . " Big bluestem and Indian grass in this Appleton , Wis. spread serve as low-maintenance substitutes for the short-grass savannas of suburbia . Yellow coneflowers and black-eyed Susans ( above ) re-create the prairie of a century ago . " This is an ecological landscape , attracting wildlife , " says Neil Diboll , president of Prairie Nursery in nearby Westfield , who planted it five years ago . The investment is all up front : maintenance $10 an acre each year , compared with $1,900 to $1,500 for an acre of manicured lawn . But you can spend from $500 to $5,000 for design and installation , depending on the site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can spend $10 a year for an attractive acre of prairie wildflowers or more than $10,000 annually for a 10,000-square-foot lot of clipped hedges and seasonal plantings . It all depends on the resources that you 're willing to commit  --  bearing in mind that time and water count almost as much as money does . To start right , decide on a master plan that you can implement over the years . You wo n't enjoy re-laying a patio once you can finally afford the swimming pool , for instance . There 's no need to get locked in , though . Any plan can be edited and refined to fit your changing inclinations and bank account . Here are five further tips , garnered from a legion of green-thumb veterans . Get the help you need . Some nurseries offer planning kits at low or no cost , complete with charts and a grid for your dimensions . You fill one out , then they suggest a plan . For custom work , many garden centers have designers on staff who will sketch ideas to suit your plot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , patio and pool will go , with their exact dimensions , run $150 to $500 . In both cases , the nursery will discount the design charge if you spend about 10 times the fee on plants , says Dick Campbell of Campbell 's Nurseries &; Garden Centers in Lincoln . Neb . Thus if you spend $2,000 on plantings , you 'll get a $200 credit against your design fee . Among independent contractors , landscape or garden designers typically charge $50 to $100 an hour . Landscape architects , who are trained in site planning , grading , land-use laws and similar issues , as well as detailed blueprint designs , are the most skilled . Typical rates : $100 an hour and up , or 12% to 15% of the final landscaping cost . If it 's a major job , solicit at least two bids and compare . For a list of pros in your area , write the American Society of Landscape Architects , 4401 Connecticut Ave . N.W. , Washington , D.C. 20008 . Once you 've landscaped , you might need a gardener @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $40 an hour . A typical 5-foot-by-100-foot lot of landscaping can require 20 to 40 hours of maintenance during the growing months . To treat an ailing tree , a consulting arborist charges $20 to $50 an hour . Expect prices on the East and West Coasts to be higher than in the Midwest and South . Do n't drain your savings . For a big job , the best solution is a home-equity line of credit that you draw down as you need it . You can deduct the interest on a loan of as much as $109,000 . The loans have been going recently for around 8.496  --  which means an after-tax cost of 5.8% to a homeowner in the 31% bracket . Consider the payback . A 1981 Gallup survey found that attractive landscaping adds 7% to 14% to a home 's resale value , but these averages conceal many individual differences . So-called hardscaping  --  that 's a gazebo or other permanent addition  --  provides more of a payback than perishable flora that may vanish with the first frost . Remember , though , upgrading ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't support a $50,000 garden , says Temmy Walker , president of a real estate agency in Studio City , Calif . As a guideline , she says , you can probably recoup the cost of a garden that 's worth as much as 10% of the value of your house . Look to plants from the past . Heirloom plants and heritage seeds are becoming the new collectibles . Blowsy , fragrant old roses , in particular , are making a big comeback , says Ken Druse , author of The Natural Shade Garden ( Clarkson Potter , $40 ) .
