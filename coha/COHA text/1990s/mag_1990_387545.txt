News from the files of the KGB <p> The much-touted new book KGB : The Inside Story , by Cambridge University professor Christopher Andrew and the former chief of the KGB 's London Residency , Oleg Gordievsky ( a 1985 defector to England ) , will likely reopen questions about Soviet espionage in the West that most American intellectuals have been unwilling to grapple with for decades . The book is based on KGB files , which Gordievsky combed while preparing a classified in-house history of KGB activities in 1980 . It focuses in part on Soviet espionage in the United States . Andrew and Gordievsky contend that Alger Hiss , the Rosenbergs , Harry Dexter White , and others were Soviet spies , and that these agents , and others , did a great deal of damage . <p> The authors also treat Soviet espionage in Britain , reviewing the **28;129;TOOLONG affair and even purporting to reveal the long-sought name of the Fifth Man ' ( John Cairncross , a former British official who held a number of sensitive posts during and after the Second World War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debate here than in England  --  for a simple reason . By and large the British have come to terms with the fact that there was significant Soviet penetration of their government , and that this had serious policy implications . Denial is n't possible because many of the accused ' actually confessed , and some ( Philby , Burgess , and Maclean , for example ) even went to live in Moscow . Nor is it necessary : England never had a Red scare or a McCarthy era . Acknowledging Soviet penetration did n't represent an admission that an entire historical era had been corrupted . <p> The United States , of course , did experience both a Red scare and a McCarthy era . Most of the accused , moreover , protested their innocence  --  some to the very end . And a debate that in Britain did n't even have much of a partisan cast ( Labourites often proved more insistent than Conservatives that long-held secrets be revealed ) took on transcendent ideological significance here . In the eyes of many Americans , either HUAC and McCarthy were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short of a Communist plot  --  or everyone charged with subversion during that whole period was entirely innocent . This all-or-nothing view makes very little sense four full decades after Alger Hiss was convicted of perjury . In the end , it is perplexing that mainstream historians have left virtually unexamined the question of how American officials who served Moscow actually damaged U.S. policy interests . And it is bizarre that for so long , this question should have been regarded as a concern present only in the precincts of the far right . <p> The most arresting and highly publicized material in the book is the Harry Hopkins revelation . ' A misguided October 15 New York Times headline proclaimed that Andrew and Gordievsky label Roosevelt 's right-hand man and closest personal aide as an unwitting Soviet spy . ' In fact , the book advances no such allegation . ( The headline was the subject of a correction ' several days later . ) The authors actually describe Hopkins as an unconscious agent . ' And though Gordievsky reports that a number of KGB officials deemed Hopkins an agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patriot with no admiration for either the principle or the practice of communism . ' <p> Even though the authors claim that Hopkins played a particularly unusual role in supporting Moscow 's concerns during the Second World War , and specifically at Yalta , he was not , they argue , a spy . This last point , of course , corresponds to the view of contemporary Hopkins scholars . Verne Newton , who produced a documentary film on the Iowa-born New Dealer , Hopkins biographer George T. McJimsey of Iowa State University , and Roosevelt scholar William E. Leuchtenberg of the University of North Carolina are , to be sure , skeptical of the whole notion that Hopkins was influenced by the Soviet security services . They note that many influential Americans took positions on U.S.-Soviet relations akin to those adopted by Hopkins during the period in question . <p> What , then , do Andrew and Gordievsky claim ? Their key point is that Hopkins was guided to a perspective consistent with Soviet wartime interests ( only after Hitler attacked the USSR and , even more , after Pearl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took place , the authors contend , in part due to the fact that among Hopkins 's private contacts was a high-ranking NKVD ( later KGB ) official , one Iskhak Akhmerov . Hopkins is reported to have had several meetings with Akhmerov , who represented himself as a direct link to Stalin . Gordievsky himself , early in his KGB career , met Akhmerov once . He listened to a lecture delivered by the aging former NKVD man and remembers well Akhmerov 's account of his dealings with Hopkins . Gordievsky later discussed Akhmerov with a number of senior KGB officials , and reviewed the KGB archive to evaluate Akhmerov 's claims . <p> According to Gordievsky , Akhmerov , a native of Baku , was the top NKVD illegal ' ( i.e. , false name , no official status , no links to the Soviet Embassy ) in the United States during the late 1930s and the war years . As such , he was Hiss 's wartime controller and was also the man who tried to recruit former NEW REPUBLIC owner Michael Straight to work for the Soviets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Straight reports of a recruitment bid by a man he came to know as Michael Green . ' Gordievsky learned in Moscow that Michael Green ' was one of the names Akhmerov used during his years in America . ) <p> Akhmerov also served briefly , in 1943 and 1944 , as Elizabeth Bentley 's link to Moscow . Bentley , a key NKVD Washington-to-New York courier who turned ' and began working with the FBI in 1945 , was subsequently a major HUAC witness . Like Whittaker Chambers , she detailed the successes achieved by the Soviets in developing espionage sources in the U.S. government . <p> The Akhmerov story as a whole makes sense . It seems more than likely that the Soviets would have had one trustworthy man in charge of all their top American assets . Such was certainly the system in Britain with respect to Philby and Company . True , we already knew about Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Harry Dexter White , Hiss , and Straight . But this fills out the story  --  and confirms that Hiss was still active , as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his diplomatic sympathies are a matter of record . It is also beyond dispute that he endeavored to remove or transfer anti-Soviet officials in the U.S. government ( Loy W. Henderson , head of State 's Soviet desk , and Major Ivan Yeaton , U.S. military attach in Moscow , for example ) from positions that gave them influence over U.S.- Soviet relations . <p> True , Hopkins was n't the only one to oppose roles of consequence in this area for anti-Communists . Eleanor Roosevelt , for example , joined him in the anti-Henderson crusade . Thus it does not necessarily follow that Hopkins 's contacts with Akhmerov led him to adopt these positions on personnel matters . Still , replacing Major Yeaton with the pro-Soviet Colonel Phillip R. Faymonville reflected , to say the least , a concern for Soviet sensibilities . And though it ca n't be shown that Roosevelt 's adviser acted , albeit unwittingly , at the suggestion of a Soviet agent , it would be naive to think the NKVD would not have tried to develop a connection to the man who , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beyond Hopkins ( to whom only a scant few pages are devoted ) the authors , for example , review the contribution of White to securing the Soviet economic presence in the Russian-occupied zone of Germany . White , an odd individual who appears to have filled the Treasury Department with Communists yet never himself wanted to join the CP , died in 1948 before finishing his HUAC testimony . A sympathetic White biographer , David Rees , concluded some time ago that White turned over valuable information to the Soviets , although he apparently had a need to pretend to himself that most of the information was going to American Communist officials in New York , rather than to Moscow . Andrew and Gordievsky help fill out the White story , which is instructive in what it tells us about the policy influence one well-placed agent can have . <p> It seems that White , during the war , was involved in economic planning for the future of Germany . A four-power occupation had already been agreed upon , and it was decided that the U.S. Treasury would print the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French and the British , wanted direct control over their end of the process , and demanded access to the actual printing plates . The Bureau of Printing and Engraving  --  as well as State Department officials  --  insisted that this would make accountability impossible , that the scheme was unnecessary and fraught with danger . But White prevailed , persuading his boss , Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. , that failing to cooperate with Moscow would undermine the wartime alliance . White won this internecine policy battle in early 1944 ; the eventual cost of this enterprise to the U.S. taxpayer is imponderable . But Moscow did print as much money as it wished , thereby debasing the occupation currency . <p> Andrew and Gordievsky also analyze the wartime contributions of the Soviet espionage rings that operated in Washington  --  in the OSS , Treasury , Commerce , and the various New Deal and war-emergency agencies . That which is already known is supplemented by new and logical information . <p> In a sense , this book is an early glimpse  --  a window  --  into the KGB archive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individuals who provided information to the Soviets during the years in question were animated by political faith , not by material concerns . This is a key point . Defenders of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg , for example , are most scandalized by the suggestion that Moscow would have used American Communists for espionage purposes . Yet it does n't require a close reading of Andrew and Gordievsky to recall that this notion of Soviet restraint vis -- vis U.S. Communists is utter nonsense . <p> Indeed , Earl Browder , leader of the American Communist Party , shortly before his death , acknowledged to a reporter that some American Communists were in a position to turn over vital information : We had people who would inform us . . . because they sympathized . . . . We did n't consider it espionage . ' It 's hard to go much higher than Browder ( although expelled from the American Party , he was never deemed a turncoat ' by Moscow ) . Thus the first question is n't whether , ' but who ' ' ? The second is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Gordievsky shed light on a range of historical subjects . Their review of Stalin 's paranoid campaign against Leon Trotsky , culminating in the 1940 assassination in Mexico , emphasizes the central role of American Communists but does n't neglect reference to the help provided , in an early and unsuccessful attempt , by the Chilean Communist poet and eventual Nobel laureate in literature Pablo Neruda . Also , Gordievsky 's archive-based assessment of the fate of Raoul Wallenberg , the young Swedish diplomat who saved many Budapest Jews from Nazi hands during the Second World War , is altogether convincing . The KGB defector reports that Wallenberg did , in fact , die in Soviet custody  --  just as Andrei Gromyko later claimed  --  in 1947 . But Wallenberg did not suffer a heart attack at the age of 35 . The NKVD had tried and failed to recruit him in Budapest back in 1945 . Further efforts to do so were made in the course of the next two years . They failed as well , and eventually the heroic Swede was shot . <p> In a manifestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the KGB archive would not soon be opened to Western scholars . Who , back then , could have predicted glasnost , the demise of communism in Eastern Europe , and the razing of the Berlin Wall ? But beyond their immediate significance , these events have implications for all who want to confront the past . There will be more books like this one . There may well be documents . There could conceivably come the naming of new names  --  names more prominent even than those of Alger Hiss and Harry Dexter White . <p> The wise path is to endeavor to place these revelations in the appropriate historical context . Part of this reckoning with the past , of course , will mean reading books like this one and realizing that Whittaker Chambers and Elizabeth Bentley and others , when they testified to the FBI and before HUAC , were telling the unvarnished truth . The alternative is sheer denial , which will likely leave many more Americans believing that Senator Joseph McCarthy , perhaps even in his tactics , was essentially correct . <p> By Eric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New York Post and a syndicated columnist . <p>
