<p> ART AND SCIENCE MAY BE THE original odd couple , but they have gone together for a very long time . During the Renaissance , when both were newly and heavily dependent on direct visual observation , a few men made real contributions in both realms . Brunelleschi invented linear , or one-point , perspective and engineered the huge dome that crowns the Cathedral of Florence . Leonardo da Vinci 's scientific observations and engineering proposals still strike us as marvels . <p> In a symposium on natural history and visual taste , David Elliston Allen once suggested a compelling connection between science and art at the end of the 18th century : geology , developing as a separate discipline , began to study the tumultuous processes that shaped rocks and mountains just as the concept of the Sublime introduced art to the combined attractions of beauty and terror . <p> A century later , the Impressionists and after them Georges Seurat based their ideas about color on contemporary studies of optics . Early in this century , Kandinsky was so struck , and troubled , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith in the material world apparently waned and he turned to a more spiritual , and ultimately more abstract , art . <p> Three museum shows in New York are currently presenting artistic , or at least photographic , views of science . At the uptown branch of the International Center of Photography , Catherine Wagner 's " Art and Science : Investigating Matter " and " Science Projects : A Taxonomy of Images " will be on view through June 22 . ( Both are sponsored by Cameraworks , a private foundation . ) At the Whitney Biennial , Douglas Blau 's " Sacred Allegory , " an assemblage of pictures of various kinds ( with an expanded version in the exhibition catalogue ) overlaps with the I.C.P. shows both in its concentration on science and scientists and in some of its images . <p> Ms. Wagner photographs laboratory tools and specimens in a black-and-white style that is not new but here mimics certain aspects of the scientific approach : coolness , objectivity , precision , analysis . The objects are isolated , arranged , beautifully lighted , taken out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific experiment . Scientists and technicians are left out altogether . In effect , these pictures stand for scientific research itself , or a category of research , like the Human Genome Project . <p> Many of the photographs present petri dishes or slides or freezer compartments or fossils in lineups of similar items or groups arranged in grids and called typologies . Form follows content again , for science frequently works by typing and classifying or comparing specimens . <p> But art can only look at science ( or anything else ) through the eyes of its time , and both the emphasis on the large , isolated object and the combination of similar objects in a grid reflect recent styles in art and photography . Collecting types has become a much-loved occupation of photographers and artists today : Richard Prince 's rephotographed media images of bikers , Bernd and Hilla Becher 's grids of photographs of industrial architecture , Annette Messager 's inkblots and proverbs . Art imitates art , no matter what the subject . <p> Ms. Wagner writes that she hopes to stimulate discussion of ideas regarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) to make construction of our own identity possible . That is a tall order for photographs , especially for images like these , which are well made but still stubbornly mute . By themselves they might pique curiosity , but philosophical discussion seems an unlikely outcome . When it comes to extending the meaning of photographs , explanatory words are almost always essential . Here , quotes about science in large light boxes and an accompanying book help expand the dialogue . ( This show was organized by Washington University in St. Louis and curated by Cornelia Homburg , an art historian at the university . ) <p> Over time , photography , a technology made possible by chemical discoveries , has had a major impact on science . In the 19th century , the credibility and exact repeatability of photographs eventually led to scientific dependence on them and easier exchange of precise and reliable information across continents and oceans . The X-ray would probably have had much less effect on the world if it had not been made visible and comprehensible in photographs , and the same is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M.R.I. and PET scans that are actually collections of digital data converted into pictorial form by computer . <p> Exhibitions of scientific photographs most often present color abstractions , like Roman Vishniac 's or Lennart Nilsson 's microphotographs or certain photographs from space . They are appreciated more for their surprising resemblance to abstract painting than for the scientific information they encode , which generally remains indecipherable to a lay audience . <p> NOT THAT ABSTRACT ART IS easy to read , but there is a sense that it is a language of our time and perhaps ought to be comprehensible even to people who do not expect ever to understand the general theory of relativity . The two cultures that C. P. Snow wrote about in " The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution " in 1959 still do not communicate well , but scientists have an easier time in art museums than liberal arts majors in the labs of molecular biologists . <p> Yet art does borrow from science . Curators collect types , too . " Science Projects " is a room full of pictures both odd and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the National Museum of American History in the Smithsonian Institution . This show , curated by Charles Stainback of I.C.P. , is really a chapter in the history of scientific public relations , which appears to have started with these pictures . <p> The Science Service was set up in 1920 by E. W. Scripps of newspaper fame and a group of scientists in Washington to promote science to the public in the press . World War I had spurred scientific advances , as wars do , and the effect of technological developments like the washing machine , the automobile and the airplane on many lives raised public awareness and interest . By the end of the 1920 's , science journalism was firmly in place in the nation 's press , though still far from its present level . <p> The pictures in this exhibition , taken from the 1930 's to the 1960 's , mostly promote scientists as discoverers and products as quiet marvels . They have the faint hokey aura of 1950 's advertisements : science as Moses in a white coat leading us into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factual manner and presented with the seeming sincerity of radio news of the time . The photographs are arranged in grids ( again ) of similar subjects : test tubes , hands displaying one discovery or another , people in isolation chambers , devices to produce light . <p> Alternately amusing and curious , they make visible a respect for science that rose quite high after both world wars . This respect has had its ups and downs in the last half century , what with the atom bomb ( up up up in the beginning , plunging later ) , Sputnik ( down down down ) and biomedical advances like cloning ( up for each advance , down when considering consequences ) . <p> Mr. Blau 's " Sacred Allegory " at the Whitney is a wall of magazine illustrations , art reproductions and movie stills that conduct fictive visual dialogues with one another about the mystery , glory and dread that have been popularly associated with scientific discovery . The piece concentrates heavily on the importance of vision : scientists staring at flasks , beakers , sudden leaping flames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with alchemy , the not-quite-sacred transmutation , proceeds through the fears inspired by the likes of Dr. Frankenstein and Dr. Jekyll , and glances at some semi scientific observations : a Chinese cook testing his soup , a wine tester sniffing the bouquet in his glass . <p> One picture is a reversed image of a painting reproduced in the catalogue of " Art and Science , " and several closely resemble images in " Science Projects " and doubtless came from the same source . A kind of provocative scrapbook , an elliptical narrative composed of reproductions of other people 's pictures that have been interpreted and directed by a picture auteur , " Sacred Allegory " turns the words " curator " and " collector " into synonyms for artist . Makes you wonder if an entire show like " Science Projects , " a work of research and selection , could be regarded as a work of art . <p> Both exhibitions cast a humorous eye on the history of attitudes to science . The pictures in " Science Projects " were culled from a promotional enterprise backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sacred Allegory , " more polyphonic , addresses the unease that scientific achievements stir in those who do not fully understand or understand too well  --  or know how to make a good movie . <p> Pictures of scientists and their devices put a face on research that is usually tedious and equations that are mostly incomprehensible . They may well explain our attitudes better than they do the facts . Surely photographic reporting on science has not only reflected but influenced our feelings about its value , as fictional imagery clearly has  --  from " Frankenstein " to " Dr. Strangelove " and " 2001 . " And surely the fiction wins for panache if not for clarity .
