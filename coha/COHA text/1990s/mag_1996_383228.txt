We 're going to make a bold statement , but one that we firmly believe is true : There is no one on the planet who knows more about the nuts and bolts of skiing on the cheap than Claire Walter . In her new book , Skiing on a Budget , which is excerpted here , Claire shares her vast knowledge of bargain hunting in ski land . E A contributing editor to SKIING for the past 15 years ( the last eight as our Western editor ) , Claire started down the road to skiing tightwad-ism in the mid ' ' 60s when she and her college roommate went to Cranmore , New Hampshire , for a midweek learn-to-ski package . It included five days of lift tickets , two lessons a day , five nights at the Oxen Yoke Inn in a bunkroom above the bar , and two meals a day-all for only $49.50 each . " It 's a testimonial to the power of the pinched penny that I still remember the amount of money after all these years , " she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband , Ral , and 14-year-old son , Andrew-she still loves a good buy . E Claire has made it her passion to know everything , and we mean everything , about as many ski resorts in the world as possible . Where other writers only want the cushy assignmentsheli-skiing in the Bugaboos , dining in Aspen 's finest restaurants-Claire travels tirelessly all winter long , checking powder stashes by day and then by night , inspecting hotel rooms , checking menu prices , and quizzing marketing directors on money-saving deals . The results of her research appear regularly in our Travel Advisory department and are the basis for her award-winning guide book , Rocky Mountain Skiing. - The Editors Ticket Tactics People tend to obsess about the highest price that one can possibly pay to ski . For instance , the most expensive single-day , at-the-window , adult lift ticket in 1995-96 was $52 at Aspen . During the same season , the average daily lift ticket across the United States remained around $30 , but people never seem to talk about that . Snaring low-cost tickets often does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Autumn means foliage , Halloween , and ski shows . These traditional ski-season previews offer oodles of giveaways , a chance to meet celebrity skiers , nuts-and-bolts news on the upcoming season , and terrific entertainment , all in a carnival atmosphere . At several shows every attendee receives a one-day lift ticket to a nearby ski area . And most are connected with a ski swap or a ski sale put on by a local retailer . You might even get lucky and win a ski vacation . Prepurchase lift tickets : Locals reap savings by buying their lift tickets before they get near the slopes . Ski retail and rental shops , gas stations , and even supermarkets sell discounted lift tickets . Local chambers of commerce , as well as hotels and local and out-of-state ski shops , sell discounted tickets . And when you purchase the actual lift ticket instead of a voucher that must be redeemed at the mountain , you get in more skiing time because you bypass the ticket window . Coupon or voucher books , available directly from ski areas or at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of skiing days and represent excellent values to those who ski often but not enough to justify a season pass . Be an eco-skier : Obviously , the more people you pack into a car , the cheaper the per-person transportation becomes . Carpool with at least three friends or relatives , and Ski Santa Fe , New Mexico , will give you $5 off one lift ticket . Whether or not the ski area rewards you financially for carpooling , if you divide the cost of gas or the parking fee , if there is one , by the number of the skiers in the vehicle , you ca n't help but save . Student savings : Some ski areas make a special effort to reach local youngsters . In addition to the more common schoolsponsored ski outings , youngsters may be rewarded for good grades , for a pledge to remain drug- or alcohol-free , or for simply living nearby . Wildcat , New Hampshire , sells a specially priced multivisit ticket to students enrolled in the D.A.R.E . and S.A.D.D . programs . Value skiing for seniors : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Big Air Green Valley Snowboard Park gives a free lift to anyone who brings an oldster of 35 or more to ride . On ski programs , 50 or 55 is about as young as a senior gets to be . Inspired by the 70+ Ski Club , which lobbied on behalf of skiers who are " up there , " many ski areas now offer free skiing for septuagenarians and older . Gearing Up If you only ski during ar annual vacation , you might want to rent equipment . To get the equipment you want and , perhaps , a price break , reserve your equipment when you book your air , lodging , and ski lessons . Pay a little extra for " performance " skis . Your investment will be rewarded by the dividend of more control and greater enjoyment . Lease programs : Some shops also lease equipment , which is not unlike automobile leasing , except that you lease skis by the season . You use the gear as you would your own , and return it after the snow melts . The following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or model . With leasing , you get reasonably up-to-date equipment at a fraction of the cost of purchasing . If you like your leased equipment , you can usually arrange to buy it at the end of the season for far less than the original retail price . Family Values Skiing is the ultimate family sport . Large ski resorts and small local areas alike compete fiercely for the family trade with everything from nurseries to family-oriented apres-ski . Of all the money-saving strategies you can employ , finding free lodging and free skiing for youngsters is one of the most effective cost-cutting measures . Best deals : Most ski areas offer free skiing for children up to about age six , and some destination resorts do even better , offering both free skiing and free lodging . Preschoolers or thereabouts ski free at most areas , but other children are often eligible for freebies too . The usual requirement is that the free child 's ticket accompany the purchase of an adult lift ticket , which means you ca n't drop a carload of kids off at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As your child enters the teen years , the financial sledding becomes rough . Not only will your child outgrow clothing and footwear with alarming speed and eat everything in the kitchen except the refrigerator , but you 're suddenly hit with an adult tab for everything from movie tickets to bus fares . While most ski areas extend children 's rates to age 12 or 13 , some ease the financial crush with teen tickets , which may be more than children 's rates but are still less than adults ' ' . Local ski areas often have part-time jobs open to teens . If your child is 12 to 15 years old and is a strong intermediate skier or better , have him or her investigate a junior ski patrol or junior instructor position . In exchange for about 40 hours a month , your teen will get free skiing , a uniform , and the cachet that comes with working at a ski area . Stretching Your Ski Vacation Dollar Think of ski vacation as a full-course meal . If you order your appetizer , soup , salad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menu , you 'll pay more than you would for a complete dinner . Likewise , if you book your airline ticket , rental car or shuttle van , accommodations , lift tickets , rental equipment , and ski lessons separately , you 'll pay much more than you would for a package . Packages-whether booked through a resort 's toll-free reservation service , a ski tour operator , or even an airlinelinked tour program-are the most efficient way to save , but seasoned traveling skiers have other tricks up their sleeves . Lodging location counts : When you 're selecting a condo or lodge , consider location as much as style and level of luxury . If you are close to the lifts , you 'll probably get on the hill earlier , and you might even be able to ski home for lunch instead of buying it on the mountain . Unless you are within walking distance of the slopes or a shuttle stop , you 'll need wheels . Look for rental cars with such value-added bonuses as a free ski rack , unlimited mileage , or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a free shuttle-bus service , you wo n't need a car at all , and an airport shuttle might be cheaper than having your rental sitting around day after day while you ski . Sleep in the city : A handful of cities near big-time ski areas often offer excellent air service , exceptional lodging deals , and , in some cases , fabulously priced ski packages . While the urban experience does not replicate that of a ski resort , it does offer great value , outstanding services , and an abundance of things to do . In addition to the economy of such a vacation strategy , you can really feel like a local skier , leaving " home " in the morning for a day trip to a nearby mountain resort and returning after the lifts close . In the city , you will find a great range of restaurants and apres-ski activities-from the traditional dining-dancingpartying to such cosmopolitan diversions as theater , concerts , and major-league sports . With their abundance of hotels and motels for business travelers , big cities also may offer the only good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time your travel : If you ca n't ski any time other than the Christmas-New Year 's holidays , expect to pay top dollar and endure maximum crowds everywhere , from lift lines to rest rooms . The second-most expensive time in the East and Midwest is during Presidents ' Week ; at destination resorts in the West , it is Presidents ' Week through late March . Looking at it from the other perspective , rates are rockbottom between Thanksgiving and Christmas and again at the very end of the season . Buy an inclusive package : Old-time ski weeks that included accommodations , two meals a day , lift tickets , ski lessons , and apres-ski activities are endangered vacation species . You may succumb to sticker shock when you look at the numbers that follow the dollar sign in an inclusive package , but when you tally up what you get , you may be surprised at the value as well as the predictability of the all-in package . Ski the Great White North : No matter how you cut it , Canadian skiing is a bargain for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar has been worth at least one-third less than U.S. currency . That makes for an automatic and very substantial discount on every ski vacation . With the open-skies policies agreed to in 1995 by the American and Canadian governments , air service is improving and fares should be competitive . In addition to the favorable exchange rate , winter is off-season in such resort towns as Banff , Jasper , and Lake Louise . All accommodations , but particularly those in Jasper , slash their rates during ski season . Eat , Drink , &; Be Merry Skiers do not live by snowy slopes alone . A successful ski day , weekend , or vacation involves eating three squares a day and often after-ski entertainment . Even if you 've been cost-cautious with everything else , it 's easy to fall off the budgetary wagon when it comes to off-slope expenditures . To spend the very least , rent a condo , food- and booze-shop wisely , have an after-ski drink in your unit , prepare every meal yourself , and spend your evenings in front of the television . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vacation . You can mix such constraint with free or inexpensive activities and have fun without breaking the bank . Window-shopping , art-gallery walks , and peoplewatching are free . Fitness centers , skating rinks , and pools are often free or inexpensive for resort guests . Brown-bagging : Midday meals can take a big chunk out of your skiing budget . Pack a hearty lunch , perhaps augment it with soup or a hot beverage , and you 'll save dollars every day you ski . If brown-bagging is n't officially permitted , you can carry some kind of lunch in pack or pocket , even munch it on the lift . If you have to go through the cafeteria line , look for the most filling choices for the lowest price . Pizza and burritos are favorite choices . A baked-potato bar is another good bet . The spuds are usually huge , and you can load them up with enough toppings to fuel you through a hard afternoon of skiing . You can also eat economically if you do as the residents do . Scan the resort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ads for other meal sales , happy-hour specials , all-youcan-eat salad bars or buffets , early-bird pricing , and children 's specials . The Group Skiing may be an individual sport , but it is also an extremely social activity . And when enough people get together , the economies of scale kick in . Join a club : The ski club has been a fixture of the American skiing scene practically as long as the sport itself , and clubs still provide a companionable and economical way to ski . Dues are modest , between $20 and $50 a year , for which members receive such benefits as an annual ski swap , bus trips to nearby ski areas , and extremely wellpriced ski vacations . They also are excellent social organizations , with meetings , social hours , picnics , local hikes , get-inshape-to-ski sessions , and slide shows . Some clubs are heavily geared to singles , others to families , still others attract older skiers . And yes , a few still maintain their own old-style ski houses . But the focus has changed from close-by skiing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry clout with airlines , motorcoach operators , and ski resorts , and they can negotiate excellent group rates . Since much of the labor involved in organizing trips is done by volunteers , clubs do n't mark up packages or take commissions , which translates into savings to members . Ski-club trips include built-in activities , such as races , mountain picnics , welcome parties , and awards parties , and sometimes sight-seeing options . Organize a group and ski free : If you know skiers and can devote the time to organizing them into a formal club , you 'll get free skiing , a network of likeminded friends , and occasional organizational hassles . Getting deals on skiing and trips is easier than you might think . SkiGroup ( 800-466-1411 ) is a series of trade shows held each spring in about 30 cities across the country where ski resorts and tour operators market their most attractive deals to ski-club officers . Or it can be informal . If you can just get 20 people together for a day , weekend , or even week of skiing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your choice . You probably can negotiate a favorable group rate and perhaps get some entertainment extras thrown in as the group size increases , especially if you are planning to ski during any but the busiest weekends and holidays . School groups , church groups , scout troops , and other youth organizations often organize ski trips . If you volunteer to chaperone , you 'll be joining a lively group on a budget ski vacation . And often , you 'll go along for free . <p>
