<p> WASHINGTON  --  You ca n't be impatient if you want to change anything around here . It 's often best not to be too timid or practical , either . <p> Take Charles Lewis , a self-described " person who perseveres when it 's completely stupid . " Decades ago that meant trying out to be a high school linebacker even though he had a broken nose and weighed 20 pounds less than his two rivals . <p> Those are about the same odds now facing a quartet that consists of Lewis and three equally persistent allies  --  Ann McBride , Kent Cooper and Ellen Miller . Each leads a group dedicated to reforming the campaign-money system . <p> This moment , as the Senate investigates troubling 1996 fund-raising , is one they have yearned for since Watergate . <p> The public is not exactly in a lather about campaign-finance reform . But these advocates say it 's a huge mistake to ignore the fact that corporations , unions and rich people are sinking tens , even hundreds of thousands of dollars apiece into candidates , causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the fundamental issue facing the country , " says McBride , 53 , the president of Common Cause . " Money has a tremendous influence on basic real-life issues . And money is drowning out our voices . " <p> McBride and Miller , 51 , executive director of Public Campaign , are lobbying for donation limits and other alternatives to the current rules governing campaign fund-raising and spending . <p> The Center for Responsive Politics , led by Cooper , 51 , churns out facts and analysis about how money influences politics . The Center for Public Integrity , founded and directed by Lewis , 43 , digs up information normally not public , such as the Lincoln bedroom guest list . <p> Not everyone considers these four players guardians of democracy . Reform opponents range from conservative Sen. Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , to labor unions , businesses , individuals and interest groups . <p> They 're against reform plans that cut back or ban certain contributions to candidates and parties . They 're also against mandatory spending limits . They contend , and the Supreme Court agrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free speech  --  including the right to saturate the air waves with political messages designed to promote or attack candidates or policies . <p> There 's no constitutional problem with voluntary spending limits or mandatory contribution limits ; there 's just tremendous resistance from the politicians who benefit from the current system . <p> Still , there 's a growing consensus that " soft money " is a problem . That 's the term for money given to parties , not to individual candidates . Unlike donations to candidates , soft money is unlimited and unregulated . It is not supposed to be used for or against specific candidates , but that 's a distinction that often evaporates in a campaign . <p> How big are the donations ? Cooper 's Web site recently headlined $ 1 million from Richard DeVos , the founder of Amway , to the Republican Party . <p> At the very least , advocates hope Congress passes a soft-money ban as a result of the Senate hearings , which ran most of July and are set to resume next month . Beyond that , their prescriptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be allowed to take money from interests regulated by their committees . <p> The most far-reaching proposal , from Miller and her group , would allow candidates who reject private contributions to dip into a taxpayer-financed campaign fund instead . " People have gotten their expectations whittled down , " Miller says . " I want to raise that bar . " <p> Is the cause hopeless , as so many say ? Well , Lewis did make the football team back in high school . <p> The four crusaders who , despite the odds , are convinced that congressional votes coming up this fall are the best shot at campaign-finance reform in 23 years : <p> Ann McBride , <p> Common Cause <p> Job : President of Common Cause , a " citizens lobby " founded 27 years ago to fight secrecy and big-money influence in politics . Web site : www.commoncause.org . <p> First political exposure : Father was a Republican state committee chairman , mother a national committeewoman . <p> First political job : Volunteered at Common Cause in 1972 to work for the Equal Rights Amendment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Defining moment : " The night I was in the gallery of the House . We 'd been working on a resolution to stop funding for the war in Vietnam . It was a tie vote and the speaker ( Carl Albert ) broke the tie . For the first time Congress went on record to end the war . Every vote mattered . All the work we did mattered . " <p> What everyone should read : Czech President Vaclav Havel 's first inaugural address for " a sense of what democracy is all about by someone who had to fight for it . " <p> What she hopes Senate hearings will achieve : " An impetus in Congress for campaign-finance reform . After the most corrupt election since Watergate and millions of dollars correctly being spent on the hearings , it 's going to be very difficult for people to go home and say , ' We have n't done anything . ' " <p> Charles Lewis , Center <p> for Public Integrity <p> Job : Executive director of the Center for Public Integrity , founded in 1990 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Web site : www.publicintegrity.org . <p> First political exposure : Volunteered in the 1972 re-election campaign of Delaware Gov .

" I was a producer for Mike Wallace . And I quit . Everybody thought I was having a breakdown . " <p> What everyone should read : The Best Congress Money Can Buy , by Phil Stern . The 1980s book is " still maddening to read . Everything he wrote about then is worse today . " <p> What he hopes Senate hearings will achieve : " I hope the Senate committee can get to the bottom of this entire mess on both sides of the aisle . If people understand they 're getting screwed , maybe they 'll start to care . " <p> Kent Cooper , Center for <p> Responsive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Responsive Politics , founded in 1983 to spotlight and analyze the role of money in politics . Web site : www.crp.org . <p> First political exposure : Four years as a college volunteer in the office of Rep. Richard Ottinger , D-N.Y . <p> First political job : Hired by a House clerk in 1972 to help organize financial reports that candidates had to file under a new law . <p> Defining moment : Quitting that job in 1974 . " The data was n't getting out . " He and a partner rented a room , consolidated copies of all the reports then being filed at three government locations and opened their doors to the media . " The press was just voracious . There were stories every single day . " The new Federal Election Commission recruited Cooper and his operation in 1975 . He left in January , 22 years later . <p> What everyone should read : The center 's Web site , which lists campaign contributions , contains analysis of spending by various interests and offers disclosure reports filed by lobbyists and politicians . " People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the money ? If they 're not bothered , fine . If they are , let them speak up . " <p> What he hopes Senate hearings will achieve : " It is clear there 's a problem with soft money . Fact-finding is going to show up the extent of the problem .

The Betrayal of American Democracy , by William Greider . " The subtitle is important . This is n't a good-government fix . This is about restoring democracy . " <p> What she hopes Senate hearings will achieve : " I hope that they paint a broad picture of the dysfunctional campaign finance system . I want to see a core focus on how candidates finance their campaigns  --  the day-to-day corruption that is legal  --  and I hope that leads to citizen activism . We know lawmakers will not change this system if we ask them nicely . They have to have no choice . "
