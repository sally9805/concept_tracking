In 1958 , when my father had his famous affair with Carroll Byrd , I knew it before anybody . I do n't know how long he was having the affair before I found out about it-or , to be exact , before I realized it . Before it came over me . One day I was riding my bike all over town the way I always did , and the next day , I was riding my bike all over town knowing it , and this knowledge gave an extra depth , a heightened dimension and color , to everything . Before , I 'd been just any old thirteen-year-old girl on a bike . Now , I was a girl whose father was having an affair-a tragic girl , a dramatic girl . A girl with a burning secret . Everything was different . <p> All my conversations , especially with my mother , became almost electrical , charged with hidden import : " pregnant with meaning , " in the lingo of the love magazines and movie magazines she was constantly reading . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved the lives of the stars above all else . She hated newspapers . She hated facts . She also hated club meetings , housework , politics , business , and her mother-in-law . She was not civic . On the other hand , she adored shopping , friends , cooking , gardening , dancing , children and babies and kittens ( all little helpless things , actually ) and my father . Especially she adored my father . Mama 's favorite word was sweet . She 'd cry at the drop of a hat , and kept a clump of pink Kleenex tucked into her bosom at all times , just in case . She called people " poor souls . " <p> That spring Elizabeth Taylor was the poorest soul around , when Mike Todd was killed in a plane crash one week before the Academy Awards . Elizabeth , clutching their tiny baby , Liza , was in shock as her Hollywood and New York friends rallied to her side . The industry had never seen such a dynamo as Todd , whose energy sparked everyone . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's twenty-sixth birthday by giving her a dazzling diamond necklace at the Golden Globes dinner . <p> Not a poor soul was Ava Gardner , who had divorced Frank Sinatra for the Italian actor Walter Chiari and now was trying to steal Shelley Winters 's husband , Anthony Franciosa , who was playing opposite her in The Naked Maja , currently being filmed in Rome . <p> " Can you imagine ? " My mother , clutching Photoplay , was outraged . " Is n't Ava ever satisfied ? Just think how Shelley Winters must feel ! " <p> " It 's terrible , " I agreed . I sat on the edge of the chaise longue to peer at the pictures of Ava and Shelley and Tony in a Rome nightclub . <p> " Look at that dress . " Mama pointed to Ava . <p> " What a bitch , " I said loyally . I you only knew , I thought . <p> " Honestly , Jenny , such language ! " But Mama was giggling . " I do n't know what I 'm going to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , already clear to both of us . The fact is I was too much for Mama , coming along to them so late in life ( a " surprise " ) , after my two sisters had " sapped her strength " and " lowered her resistance , " as she said , to all kinds of things , including migraines , asthma , and a heart murmur . These ailments required her to lie down a lot but did not prevent her from being perfectly beautiful , as always . <p> My mother was widely known as one of the most beautiful women in Virginia ; everybody said so . Previously she had been the most beautiful girl in Charleston , SC , where she had grown up as Billie Rutledge and lived until she married my father , John Fitzhugh Dale Jr. , a naval officer stationed there briefly before the war . " Just long enough to sweep me off my feet , " she always said . He was a divine dancer , and my most cherished image of my parents involved them waltzing grandly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress , he in a snappy uniform , her hair and his buttons gleaming golden in the light from the sparkling chandeliers . <p> Thus she became Billie Rutledge Dale , in a ceremony I loved to imagine . It was a wedding of superlatives : the handsomest couple in the world , a wedding cake six feet high , a gown with a train fifteen feet long , ten bridesmaids , a horse and buggy-not to mention a former suitor 's suicide attempt the evening before , while everybody else was dancing the night away at the rehearsal dinner . I was especially fascinated by this unsuccessful project ; the young man had tried to hang himself from a coatrack in a downtown men 's club , after which he was forever referred to as Bobby " Too Tall " Burkes . <p> Some people said Mama looked like Marilyn Monroe , but I did n't think so ; Mama was bigger , blonder , paler , softer , with a sort of inflatable celluloid prettiness . She looked like a great big baby doll . People also said I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true either , at least not yet , and I did n't want it to become true , at least not entirely , as I feared that taking after her too much might eventually damn me into lying down a lot of the time , which looked pretty boring . <p> On the other hand , I was simply dying to get my period , grow breasts , turn into a sexpot , and wreak as much havoc as Mama , who had broken every heart in Charleston and had a charm bracelet made out of fraternity pins to prove it . She used to tick them off for me : " Now that was Smedes Black , a Phi Delt from UVA , such a darling boy ; and this one was Parker Winthrop , a Sigma Chi at W &L,; he used to play the ukulele . ... " I was agog , drunk on the sound of so many alphabetical syllables . My mother had " come out " in Charleston ; my older sisters had attended St. Catherine 's School and then " come out " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , outside Lynchburg , where we lived . I was expected to follow in my sisters ' footsteps . <p> But then our paths would diverge , as I secretly planned to go up North to college before becoming ( to everyone 's astonishment ! ) a writer . First I would write steamy novels about my own hot love life , eventually becoming world famous like Grace Metalious . I would make millions of dollars and give it all to starving children in foreign lands . I would win the Nobel Prize . Then I would become a vegetarian poet in Greenwich Village . I would live for Art . <p> I had a big future ahead of me . But so far , nothing doing . No breasts , no period , no sex , no art . Though very blond , I was just any skinny , pale , wispy-haired kid on a bike , quick as a rabbit , fast as a bird , riding invisible all over town , bearing my awful secret . <p> I knew who she was , of course . We all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the county judge for forty years . After retirement he became a hermit  --  or as close as was possible in Lewisville , which was chock-full of neighborly , curious people naturally bound and determined to look after each other all the time . ( " I swear to God ! " my father remarked once in exasperation ; " If the Devil himself moved into this town , I guess you 'd take him a casserole , too ! " ) Judge Byrd was a wild-looking , white-haired , ugly old man whose eyebrows grew all the way across his face in the most alarming fashion ; he walked bent over , leaning on a stick topped by a carved ivory skull and yelling at children . He smelled bad . He did not socialize . He did not go to church , and was , rumored to be an atheist . When he died , everyone was shocked to learn that there would be no funeral , unheard of in our town . Furthermore , he was to be cremated . <p> " Cremated ... " I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communist ? Do n't they do it in Russia and places like that ? " <p> " Lord no , honey . " Daddy was laughing . " It 's perfectly common , in this country as well as abroad . For one thing , it 's a lot more economical . " <p> " Well , it certainly is n't southern , " Mama sniffed . " And I certainly do n't intend to have it done to me , are you listening , John ? I want my body to remain as intact as possible , and I want to be buried with all my rings on . And a nice suit , or maybe a dress with a little matching jacket . And I want lots of yellow roses , as in life . " <p> " Yes , Billie . " Daddy hid a smile as he went out . Daddy was Old Man Byrd 's lawyer , and so was in charge of the arrangements . I could n't believe my own daddy was getting to go inside Old Man Byrd 's vine-covered mansion outside town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But of course my father was the best lawyer in town , so it followed that he 'd be the judge 's lawyer . And since he was the soul of discretion , it also followed that he 'd never mentioned this to us , not even when my cousin Jinx and I got caught trying to peep in Old Man Byrd 's windows on a dare . I still remember what we saw : a gloomy sitting room full of dark , crouching furniture ; a fat white cat on a chair ; the housekeeper 's sudden , furious face . <p> Jinx and I were grounded from our bikes for a whole week , during which I completed a paint-by-numbers oil painting of The Last Supper , done mostly in shades of orange and gold , and presented it to my daddy , who seemed surprised . <p> " I 'm sorry for trespassing , " I 'd said . " I 'll never do it again . " But I was n't sorry , not in the least . The incident marked the beginning of my career . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I did on my bike trips around town . I 'd seen some really neat stuff , too . I had seen Roger Ainsley , the coolest guy in school , squeezing pimples in his bathroom mirror . I 'd seen Mr. Bondurant whip his big son Earl with a belt a lot harder than anybody ever ought to , and later , when Earl dropped out of school and enlisted in the army , I alone knew why . I had seen my former fourth-grade teacher , prissy Miss Emily Horn , necking on the couch with her boyfriend and smoking cigarettes . Best of all , I had seen Mrs. Cecil Hertz come running past a picture window wearing nothing but an apron , followed shortly by Mr. Cecil Hertz wearing nothing at all and carrying a spatula . <p> It was amazing how careless people were about drawing their drapes and pulling their shades . It was amazing what all you could see , especially if you were an athletic and enterprising girl . I wrote my observations in a Davy Crockett spiral notebook I 'd bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date , time , weather , physical descriptions , my reaction . I would use all this stuff later , in my novels . <p> I saw Carroll Byrd the very first time I rode out there to spy on her , after the old man 's death . It was a cold gray day in January , and she was burning trash . The sky was so dark that I did n't even notice the smoke at first , not until I was halfway down the long lane from the road to the house-her house , now . Despite the cold , she had opened all the windows , flinging the shutters outward , and left the front door wide open , too . Airing everything out , I guessed . The house wore a rattled , astonished expression . She had a regular bonfire going on the patio in the side yard-cardboard boxes , newspapers , magazines . She emerged from the house with armful after armful of papers to feed the yellow flames . <p> I had ditched my bike up the lane ; now I dodged behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting . Neither my mother nor her friends would ever have acted this way . In the first place , they all had constant help and never lifted a finger carrying anything . In the second place , Mama " would not have been found dead " dressed the way Carroll Byrd was that day : she wore work boots , just like a field hand ; a man 's pants , belted at the waist ; and a thin , long-sleeved black sweater . Her dark hair , longer than any woman 's in town , was pulled severely back from her high forehead , tied with a string , and fell straight down her back . Indian hair , streaked with gray . I knew instinctively that she did n't care about the gray , would never color it . Nor would she ever wear makeup . Her face was lean and hard , her cheekbones chiseled . She had inherited her father 's heavy brows , like dark wings above the deepset black eyes . <p> While I watched , she suddenly paused , and my heart leapt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I had been discovered . But no . Carroll Byrd had stopped to eye an ornate white trellis , nonfunctional but pretty , which arched over the path between the house and patio . Hand on hip , she considered it . She walked all around it . Then , before I could even believe what she was doing , she 'd ripped it out of the ground and was breaking it up like so many matchsticks , throwing the pieces into the fire . Red flames shot into the lowering sky . She laughed out loud . I noted her generous mouth , the flash of white teeth . <p> Then Carroll Byrd sat down on an old iron bench to watch her fire for a while . She lit a cigarette , striking the match on her boot . Now I noticed that she was n't wearing a brassiere , something I had read about but never seen done among " nice " women . As she leaned to stub out her cigarette on the patio tiles , I saw her breasts shift beneath the black sweater . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on page 72 in Jinx 's and my dog-eared , hidden copy of Peyton Place . I was both disgusted and thrilled . <p> There in the cramped and pungent safety of the giant boxwood bush , I fell in love . We watched her fire , the two of us from our different vantage points , until it burned itself out . Then she ran a hose on the ashes before she went inside her father 's house and shut the door . <p> I sneaked back to my bike and rode down the long lane and then home , pedaling like crazy , freezing to death . But my own house seemed too warm , too bright , too soft-suddenly I hated the baby-blue shag rug in my room , hated all my stuffed animals . I wanted fire and bare trees and cold gray sky . I went straight to bed and would n't get up for dinner . After a while , Mama came in and took my temperature ( normal ) and brought me a bowl of milk toast on a tray . This was what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was delicious . <p> Mama was a great cook . She also loved to talk on the phone , and during the next weeks , I strained to overhear any mention of Carroll Byrd . I got plenty of material . But since Mama generally stayed home and was the receiver rather than the purveyor of news , it was sometimes hard for me to figure out what had happened . <p> " She what ? " <p> " You 're kidding ! Why , those rugs are worth a fortune ! That furniture came from England ! " <p> " Oh , he did not ! " <p> " Well , that is the strangest thing I have ever heard of in my whole life . The strangest ! " <p> " You 're kidding ! " <p> I had to decipher the news : Carroll Byrd had given away the downstairs furnishings and the Oriental rugs to distant relations , who had showed up in U-Hauls to cart them away . Then she fired the housekeeper . She had hired Billy Estep , a local ne'er-do-well and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the dining room and the parlor , and to paint everything white , including " that beautiful paneling . " ( " Have you ever ? " ) Next , several huge wooden crates had arrived for Carroll Byrd from Maine , and Billy had come down to the train station and picked them up in his truck . <p> For Carroll Byrd was a painter , it developed . Not a housepainter but the other kind  --  an artist . The minute I heard this , a long shudder like an electric shock ran from the top of my head to my feet . An artist . <p> Of course ! She had decided to stay on in her father 's house because she loved the light down here as spring came on . <p> " The what ? " Mama asked , puckering her mouth as she talked on the phone to Jinx 's mother . " I mean , it 's light up in Maine , too , is n't it ? " <p> Well , yes , but Carroll Byrd feels there is a certain special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to capture on canvas . So now Billy Estep is building frames , huge frames , for her . And now he 's going around to junkyards for pieces of iron , and now he 's buying welding tools at Southern States Supply . For her sculptures  --  turns out she 's a sculptor , too . Newly elevated to importance by his privileged relationship to Carroll Byrd , Billy Estep is grilled mercilessly by all the women in town , and clams up . He wo n't tell anybody anything . Neither what she 's painting , nor what she wears , nor what in the world she does out there all day long by herself . Billy Estep buys her groceries in the Piggly Wiggly , consulting a list penned in a stark , angular hand . He wo n't even say what she eats ! He is totally loyal to Carroll Byrd . <p> But the women turn against her . They drive out there to welcome her , two by two , carrying cakes or pies or casseroles or congealed salad , to be met cordially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ask them in . She responds politely to questions but does not initiate any topics . Finally , in some consternation , the women turn on their heels and lurch off down the long walk , but not before noticing that she 's made a huge mess of the patio-why , it 's got an old iron gate and pieces from the junkyard piled in the middle of it , some of them welded together into some kind of awful-looking construction that Mama swears is a human figure but Jinx 's mama says is no such thing-and not before seeing that she 's had Billy Estep plow up all that pretty grass in front of the house for a big vegetable garden , of all things ! No lady has a vegetable garden , and no person in her right mind would put one in front of a nice house , anyway . ( " Lovely home , " Mama always says . ) <p> Several weeks after accepting all the food , Carroll Byrd sends Billy around to deliver plates and containers back to their owners , each with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creamy notepaper with raised initials . <p> This notepaper seems to make Mama madder than anything yet . ( " I 'll swear ! It 's not like she does n't know any better . ... " ) By then it is clear to all that Carroll Byrd is determined to be as much of a hermit , even more of a hermit , than her father was , and in the way of small towns , everybody stops badgering her and even begins to take a perverse pride in her eccentricity . " See that long driveway goes right up that way ? " a visitor might be told . " There 's a world-famous woman artist lives up there all by herself . Never goes past the gate . " <p> But most people , including Mama , forgot all about Carroll Byrd as spring turned into summer and more recent events claimed everyone 's attention . Young Susan Blackwelder had a miscarriage , then fell into a depression ; old Mr. Bishop retired and then sold his downtown Commercial Hotel to two young men from Washington who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , and led to some fascinating observations . Best of all , Miss Lavinia Doolittle knelt but never rose from taking communion at the altar in the Episcopal church on Palm Sunday . She died with her wafer in her mouth . I loved this , and was furious that we had missed it by attending the late service rather than the early , just because Mama always said nine o'clock was " too early for God or anybody . " <p> Still , I did n't forget about Carroll Byrd . I rode my bike out there about once a week all summer long , with time off for camp and Bible school and the beach . I 'd usually find her outside , wearing a halter and cut-off jeans , working in the garden with her braided hair wound up on top of her head . She was brown as a berry , strong as a man . The garden thrived , with shiny red tomatoes and big-leafed , tropical-looking squash plants and enormous sunflowers that nodded on their stalks like happy idiots . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often I thought I would , but I never did . One time she had put a plateful of vegetables from the garden on a table , and set up an easel outdoors to paint them . I could n't see the painting , but I could see her face : dire , ruthless , beautiful . <p> It stayed with me while I went off to 4-H Camp and then Camp Nantahala and then to Virginia Beach with my mother and Jinx and Jinx 's mother . Virginia Beach was loud and bright and fun , though Jinx and I were dismayed to find that a boy from our class back in Lewisville , Buddy Womble , was staying right down the beach , and would not let us alone . He liked to sneak up on us while we were lying in the sun with wet pads of cotton over our eyes , as suggested by Teen magazine . " Gotcha ! " Buddy Womble would holier , kicking sand , which stuck to our baby-oiled arms and legs , making us look like sandpaper girls . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HAR DEE HAR HAR " at the top of his lungs . Jinx and I hated him . We went spying on his cottage one night and were appalled to witness Buddy 's fat father , sitting alone on the porch , suddenly bury his face in his hands and sob as if his heart would break . This violated every known rule of conduct . Men were not supposed to cry , especially not fathers . " Yuck , " Jinx mouthed at me , her round white face like a horrified little moon in the shadows . I felt my own heart drop to my feet in a kind of long , sickening fall . The next day we were a lot nicer to Buddy on the beach . <p> Our mothers played bridge and went on a gin-and-tonic diet , which meant they walked up and down the beach a lot with insulated plastic tumblers in their hands . Jinx and I won cheap jewelry by throwing softballs at stuffed cats in the amusement park , rode rented bikes , and drank some gin of our own with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had stolen it from their parents . We bleached our hair with lemon juice . We got real tan , and did not burn our eyelids . The weather was perfect every day except the last , which dawned rainy , and so we packed up and drove home early to surprise Daddy . <p> Our daddies would be at work , of course , so Mama dropped Jinx and her mother off first , then let me out at home while she went to the grocery store . I let myself in and took my bag up to my room , which looked smaller suddenly , a baby 's room . I put my bag on the bed and turned back to the mirror , then stopped still , in shock-I had almost failed to recognize myself ! My bleached blond hair  --  longer than it had ever been  --  curled wildly around my dark face , which looked different , too ... thinner , not so babyish . <p> I raced outside and got my bike out of the garage and rode off to see Carroll Byrd . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered by a fine mist of rain , like my own sweat , by the time I turned down her lane . I rode until I reached the hedge where I always hid my bike , then slipped behind the farthest boxwood , looking toward the house . <p> But I went no closer . <p> For there , parked right in front , was Daddy 's car , the familiar big gray Oldsmobile with the AAA and Rotary Club stickers . Even from where I was , I could see his old canvas hat stuck under the back windshield . <p> I waited and waited . At first I thought , Oh , well , Daddy 's her lawyer . This is a lawyer visit . Then I stopped thinking anything as gradually it came over me . I did n't move a muscle . I stayed behind that boxwood for one hour and forty minutes by my watch , then dodged back to the hedge and got my bike and rode home . When I went to bed that night , after Mama 's special supper and Daddy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if I had run a race , or climbed a mountain . <p> I never rode my bike to Carroll Byrd 's house again . The horrible thing was that I did n't really blame Daddy . I could see why he would love her . In a way , I felt , Daddy was like her : a loner , an observer , an outsider ... despite the fact that he 'd been born and brought up right here , in Lewisville , despite the fact that he was doing exactly what he was supposed to be doing and had been at it for decades . <p> Daddy had run the mill ( Dale Industries ) ever since he was twenty-eight , when his father killed himself . <p> I remember clearly the day I asked Daddy to tell me about this . We were down at the mill , in the very office where he had done it . It was after hours , but Daddy was trying to finish some paperwork at the same desk where my grandfather had kept the gun in the bottom drawer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why did Granddaddy shoot himself ? " <p> But all Daddy would say was , " Oh , Jenny , honey , there are pressures , circumstances , that you ca n't possibly understand at your age " - the kind of response that infuriated me . I went right out and broke the aerial off Daddy 's car , then lied about it . I said it had been done by some kids in a blue van with Ohio tags . Daddy always underrated me . As a future novelist and student of the human soul , I knew a lot more than he thought I did . I was capable of understanding anything he had to tell me . <p> I alone understood that Daddy was a hero , a tragic figure . He stood six foot three and looked like Gregory Peck , with a tall , rangy body , a prominent nose , dark , thick hair , and sad gray eyes that seemed to see everything . Perhaps to make up for his own father 's lapses , Daddy was the most responsible man in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , involving himself not only in the daily business of the mill but also in the lives of the families who had been working there for generations : tirelessly attending funerals , weddings , graduations , wakes . My mother rarely went with him to these events , as she had " better things " to do , and found " those people " depressing . Daddy served on every board in town and belonged to every organization , or so it seemed to me . <p> He also took care of my mean old grandmother and my shy maiden aunt , Chloe , who lived with her ; he visited them nearly every day . Aunt Chloe had had polio , and she leaned to the left as she walked . My grandmother , Ernestine Dale , enjoyed absolutely nothing as far as I could see , except television ; Daddy had bought them the first set in town . Grandmother claimed to watch only the quiz shows , calling them " educational , " but actually she watched that television all the time . She had trained Aunt Chloe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitor arrived on the porch ; by the time Aunt Chloe had let the visitor into the parlor , my grandmother would be reading the Upper Room or the Bible . <p> Oh , she acted simpery sweet , but she did n't fool me for a minute-she was a fake , an old bitch . I did n't like her , and she did n't like me much either , complaining that I was a " tomboy " and a " roughneck , " criticizing my nails , which I bit to the quick , and trying to convince me that I should like Charles Van Doren better than Elvis Presley . My grandmother was an old fool ! She wore big black dresses and smelled like Mentholatum . I used to put baby powder in her tapioca and rearrange everything on her night table every time I went to her house , so she would think she was going crazy . <p> I felt sorry for Daddy . He had to take care of Grandmother 's and Aunt Chloe 's affairs as well as our own ; he also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judy ( that 's Judy Dale Tuttle Miller Hall ) , in and out of one crazy marriage after another , while at home he had two daughters to raise and then me ( the surprise ! ) . Daddy really had his work cut out for him . He had a beautiful wife who required a lot of coddling and catering to-something I 'd always assumed he enjoyed , but following my observations of Carroll Byrd , I realized that Mama was too soft , too sweet , too safe for Daddy , like one of those pink satin pillows on her huge unmade bed . A man could sink down in there and never get out . <p> Suddenly I saw Daddy as stifled , smothered by all that pink silk . I saw him as a restless cowboy in Grandmother 's parlor , as a hawk among knickknacks . <p> No wonder he loved Carroll Byrd . <p> I still loved her , too ; and in a way , I felt , this love brought me closer to my father , though he did n't know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of loyalty to my mother and because I knew that Carroll Byrd would never love me back . She 'd never even know me . The affair would not last long-these things never did , I told myself . ( Never mind what had happened to Debbie Reynolds , poor soul ! ) <p> Anyway , I was used to loving people who did n't love me back . After all , I 'd been in love with Tom Burlington , my sister 's husband , for years and years . Three years , to be exact , but it seemed like an eternity . <p> My sister Caroline did not deserve Tom Burlington . I could n't imagine how she had ever tricked him into marrying her . My grandmother always called Caroline a " flibbertigibbet , " and for once , I agreed with her . Caroline was simply too bouncy . She wore everybody out . Of course she was a cheerleader at St. Catherine 's ; of course she was " Most Popular " in the yearbook ; of course she was president of her class twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her junior year , where of course she pledged Tri Delt . She made solid B 's and majored in elementary education . Caroline had a perky ponytail , boundless enthusiasm , and the whitest teeth I 've ever seen . By Christmas of her senior year , she was engaged to Tom ; right after graduation , they got married . <p> Caroline 's wedding was the biggest event in our family that I could remember . My oldest sister , Beth , had married quietly ( in the little chapel of St. Michael 's Episcopal Church ) before moving to California , where her young husband had a very good job in the computer industry , which nobody had ever heard of . She had had one child already , and now was expecting another . I did n't know Beth at all , though I 'd always felt I 'd like her , because of the sweet way she held her baby in the photographs she sent home . And when she and her husband came east for Caroline 's wedding , Beth was the only person thoughtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a turquoise flower . ( I cried and cried when I lost it in the lake at Camp Nantahala the following summer . ) <p> I was the youngest bridesmaid . I got to wear a white organdy dress with a pink satin sash , a picture hat , and little pearl earrings . I got to carry a bouquet of pink rosebuds and baby 's breath . I even got to wear Cuban heels-my first high heels ever-over my grandmother 's objections . She said I was too young . My mother said , " Oh , Ernestine , I 'm sure you 're right , " and let me wear them anyway . I looked perfectly beautiful at Caroline 's wedding , much prettier than the bride , who was a bit too wholesome for white . Caroline looked like a nurse . <p> But her groom , Thomas Burlington , looked like Troy Donahue . He was the handsomest boy I 'd ever met , and the nicest , possessing all of Daddy 's sensitivity , but without the aloofness . <p> I had been predisposed toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the telephone : " Well , he does n't have a penny to his name , but he 's real smart , he 's gotten all these scholarships . ... Oh , yes , we like him . You ca n't help but like him . ... he 's got a master 's degree in English literature , have you ever ? ... Well , I do n't know . Teach school , I reckon . " Mama 's tone betrayed what she thought about teaching school , and I was sure Caroline held the same opinion . A schoolteacher would never be able to support Caroline , not even the cutest schoolteacher in the world , which Tom was . He did n't know what he was getting into ! ( Though they had received so many wedding presents that they could sell them off and live for a year or two on the proceeds , it looked like to me . ) <p> The reception was held in our backyard , under a huge white tent set up by caterers . Inside , the presents were displayed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole sea of silver , china , and crystal . I had earlier pocketed a nifty jade paperweight sent by an obscure relative of Tom 's , to keep as a souvenir . <p> I started loving Tom Burlington at the reception and never stopped . The party was all but over . Tom and Caroline had said their vows , cut the cake , made the toasts , and everybody was dancing to terrible music ( Percy Faith ) . Caroline had gone upstairs to put on her " going-away outfit . " My feet were killing me . I shifted from foot to foot to keep my heels from sinking into the grass as I waited in the front yard , clutching my little net package of rice , wishing I had n't gotten so grown up all of a sudden , so I could run down the road playing tag with my cousins . <p> " Why do n't you just take them off ? " Suddenly , Tom was at my elbow . He pointed to my shoes . <p> " Oh , I 'm fine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heels all the time , " I said . <p> " Well , I was just thinking of taking my own shoes off , " Tom said . " In fact , I believe I will . " He stepped out of his loafers and leaned down to peel off his socks . He had changed into a seersucker suit with a white shirt and a striped tie . <p> " Me too , then . " My feet sank into the heavenly cool thick grass . <p> " And now , Miss Jennifer , I wonder if you would do me the honor of accompanying me over to get another bite of that cake , " Tom said formally . " There 's plenty of time . You know how long it takes your sister to get dressed . " <p> He held his arm out the way people do in movies , and I took it . We left our shoes right where they were and went over to the huge , delicious , complicated cake on its own table , attended by a waiter . " Which layer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Chocolate , please . " There was a white layer , a yellow layer , and a chocolate layer . Trust Caroline to have a fancier cake than anybody in Lewisville had ever had before . <p> Tom chose chocolate , too . " Now how about a drink ? " he asked . <p> " I 'd love some champagne , " I said . <p> Tom did n't bat an eye . He disappeared and came back with a glass of champagne for me and one for himself . He clinked my glass in an elegant toast : " To the lovely Miss Jennifer . " This is the exact moment I fell in love . Then he quoted a real poem , which began : " A sweet disorder in the dress ... " It was very long and perfectly beautiful . <p> I held my breath the whole time . At the end of the poem , I raised my glass and drained it . The champagne went straight up my nose . I started crying and crying , and could n't stop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears . He did not say " Do n't cry , " or " There now . " Instead , he wiped at them gravely , scientifically , with a linen napkin . Then he took my arm again and escorted me gallantly back across the grass to the front yard , where everyone had gathered now , with Mama up on the steps in her billowing satin gown with her hand to her forehead like an explorer , anxiously scanning the crowd . <p> " Here he is ! " she called back inside . " OK , dear ! " And then Caroline emerged in a beige suit with a corsage , carrying her bouquet . Before I knew it , Tom had moved to her side , and flashbulbs were popping , and then she threw the bouquet straight to me . Everybody cheered . ! clutched it tight , forgetting to throw my rice , while Tom and Caroline ran the gauntlet out to their waiting limo and were rushed away to the Mountain Lake Hotel , where they would do it all night long . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved that bouquet , though . I have it still . <p> When the wedding pictures came , everybody was amused to see that Tom had gone off on his honeymoon barefooted . Nobody but me knew why . Nobody but me ever knew that he had toasted me with champagne and said a poem to me . <p> From that day forward , I loved Tom with a rapt , fierce , patient love . Sometimes ! even talked myself into believing , for an hour or so at a time , that Tom had married Caroline only to get closer to me , to wait for me to grow up . Other times even I had to admit that their marriage seemed to be going OK . <p> Tom got a job teaching English at a boys ' boarding school outside Charlottesville , which afforded them a nice free house on campus that Caroline immediately fixed up like a miniature version of Mama 's . Tom got a promotion , then another promotion and a raise . Caroline taught second grade and joined the Junior League and gave little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I drove up one Saturday , Caroline served us shrimp salad on bone china with a scalloped gold edge . Caroline told us she and Tom were very happy , which I had no reason to doubt . <p> But unrequited love is the easiest sort of love to hang onto , and I 'd cherished mine for three years now , until it had become not only a passion but a habit . Whenever I heard Debbie Reynolds 's hit " Tammy , " for instance , I 'd change the words to " Tommy " in my mind : <p> The old hootie-owl <p> Hootie-hoos to the dove , <p> " Tommy , Tommy , <p> Tommy 's in love . " ... <p> with me ! His bare feet in the wedding pictures provided all the proof I needed . Of course I also liked the pictures because I was in them , looking terrific . <p> On the other hand , I hated looking at Mama and Daddy 's wedding pictures because I was not in them , because I had n't even existed then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thought of death . I had tried to explain this to Jinx , but she did n't get it . Nobody got it . <p> I saw myself as a little island with time stretching out before and behind , all around me like a deep lake , mysterious and never-ending , like Lake Nantahala where I lost my ring , where a person might lose anything . This precarious view made everything that happened to me seem very , very important . I had to see as much as I could see , learn as much as I could learn , feel as much as I could feel . I had to live like crazy all the time , an attitude that would get me into lots of trouble later on . So it did n't matter , not really , whether or not Tom loved me back . Sometimes  --  I knew this from observing Mama and her baby brother , Mason-you 're bound to love the one the most who loves you least , and least deserves it . <p> Mason was just no good . Everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Mama and Daddy when his parents-my grandparents-died suddenly in the same year , many years ago . Seventeen years older than me , Mason was grown and gone by the time I was born . He had finally graduated from our local high school by the skin of his teeth , distinguished by nothing-no sports , no clubs . Nice girls would not date him . College was out of the question . Mason wore T-shirts and the same leather jacket all through school ; his swept-back hair was long and greasy . Even Daddy could not get a button-down shirt or a sport jacket on him . <p> Mason had been a juvenile delinquent , which thrilled me . I would surely have adored him if he had been nice to me at all , but his interest in me was confined to ruffling my hair at infrequent intervals through my childhood and mumbling " Hey now " out of the side of his mouth . <p> That was it . And now , following some awful fight , he and Daddy had had a " parting of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man who stood on principle , though the rift broke Mama 's heart . I was n't sure what the final straw had been . I knew Daddy had paid off Mason 's debts numerous times and had set him up in two businesses that had failed . Somewhere along the way , Mason had married " disastrously " ( Mama ) a much older woman of no consequence , with three children . Her name was Gloria , but I never met her or even laid eyes on her . I hardly ever laid eyes on Mason , either . He lived near Norfolk now and worked in the shipyards , I thought . He no longer showed up for holidays , and had not even attended Caroline 's wedding . <p> So by the time of this story , a sighting of Mason was as rare as a comet  --  and could take place only during the daytime , when Daddy was not at home . On those few occasions , Mason scared me a little-he 'd grown fat and scruffy-looking , and needed a shave . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some guy you 'd see on the side of a road , hitchhiking . He looked older than he was , down on his luck . <p> Daddy was still officially waiting for Mason to " come around . " In the meantime , Mama gave him money . That 's what these visits were all about : money . I knew it , though Mama never said so . She received Mason privately  --  in her bedroom or the Florida room or the living room-anywhere I was not . She made sure to close whatever door existed between me and them . When Mason left , looking shifty , Mama always seemed to have her purse nearby  --  on her bed or a coffee table or a sofa . Right there . Wherever they 'd just been . I was no dummy ; I could put two and two together . She did n't have to tell me not to tell Daddy , either ; I already knew that . Just as I knew that Mason never came unless he needed money , which must have hurt her deeply . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left . " Oh , Jenny , honey , come here and hug your mama , " she 'd call , and I would go , patting her plump shoulder while she sobbed into her pink Kleenex . " That poor soul , " she 'd wail , " that poor , poor soul ! " <p> I did n't even like Mason by then , and I could n't understand why Mama would waste her tears on him when she had such a brilliant and adorable daughter right there on the premises . Now , so many years later and a parent myself , I understand that there is no anguish like that of not being able to make a loved one become the person you think he ought to be . It ca n't be done , of course . But they had not given up on him yet , not Mama and not even Daddy . Why , Mason was barely thirty years old ! Surely he 'd come to his senses . Surely he 'd shape up . In the fall of 1958 , Mama and Daddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I were in my room listening to records when the call came . It was a Saturday afternoon , bright and blowing outside , leaves flying everyplace . We were stretched out on the shag carpet trying to figure out what in the world " Nel blu di pinto di blu " ( " Volare " ) meant and sighing over " Fever " by Peggy Lee . We knew what that meant . I had just put Elvis on when the phone rang . Jinx jumped up . She was hoping to hear from Stevie Burns , who had said he 'd " call her " this weekend ; I knew Jinx had made her mother promise to give him our number before she 'd agree to come over . Since summer , Jinx had ( 1 ) started her period , and ( 2 ) gotten popular , just like that . She would n't go spying with me anymore . <p> I had a baby-blue Princess phone in my room , and Jinx grabbed it on the first ring . " Hello , " she said . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eager now . <p> I sat up too , vicariously excited , thinking I might pick up some useful pointers for handling future dates . So I was watching closely as Jinx 's smiling mouth went into that frozen O , as she shut her brown eyes for a long moment before carefully replacing the receiver on its cradle . <p> Downstairs , Mama started to scream . <p> " Oh , Jenny , " Jinx finally said . " Your uncle is dead . " <p> " What ? " I had to think for a minute to know who she was talking about . <p> " Mason , " she said . " Is n't his name Mason ? Mason 's been shot . " <p> " Shot , " I repeated . <p> " Murdered , " Jinx said . <p> The word hung in the air in my bedroom , quivering along with Elvis 's voice : " For , my darling , I love you , and I always will . " I turned the record player off just as Mama rushed through the door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears . <p> The story , what we could learn of it , went like a country song . Mason 's wife had left him for another man , and Mason had gone looking for her . He 'd found them at last in some bar in Norfolk , where things had turned ugly fast . Mason had pulled a knife and cut the man 's face . Then the man shot him . <p> " Shot him dead ? " I asked Mama . <p> " No , honey . Shot him four times before he died . " Mama sank onto my canopied bed , wailing . " He was the most delightful little boy , " she cried . " I was just a newlywed when he came to live with us , you know . Just a girl . Your daddy was always working , always gone . So it was Mason and me . We grew up together . He was the sweetest boy , you ca n't imagine . Maybe he was too sweet , maybe that was the problem , he just never could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord , it started so soon . If only  --  if only we- " Mama went on and on . <p> Jinx sneaked out , looking panicked . She waved from the door . I sat on the bed hugging Mama for what seemed like hours , until the arrival of Jinx 's mother . I was never so glad to see anybody in my life . Then suddenly my wild Aunt Judy was there too , serious for once ; and our minister , Mr. Bevis Little ; and then Dr. Nevins , who gave Mama some pills that shut her up all right but made her too calm , I felt . <p> Downstairs , on a tufted velvet loveseat I 'd never seen her in , sat Mama , all vacant and glassy-eyed , asking for Daddy . Meanwhile Aunt Judy was on the phone constantly while Jinx 's mother answered the door . <p> " Where is John ? " Mama kept asking . " I just ca n't understand where John is . " <p> Nobody else could either . Aunt Judy could n't seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had gone for the night . Daddy did this occasionally , though he 'd read and reflect rather than hunt . It was his retreat . <p> Finally Aunt Judy dispatched his good friend Ed Long to get him , but an hour and a half later Ed called with the perplexing message that Daddy was not at the cabin , and it did n't look like he 'd even gotten there yet . Soon , our house was filling with people and food ; I was amazed at how fast the news spread . Jinx came back over to " be with me " ; I think it was not until I saw her in her church dress that I realized the seriousness of what had happened . The phone kept ringing , and people kept going in and out . Arrangements were made . They were sending Mason 's body over from Norfolk in a hearse . It would arrive at our local funeral home by evening . Mr. Joines , the undertaker , showed up . He talked to Mama , who did not seem to grasp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a way that scared me . My grandmother appeared , all dressed up , and started bossing everybody around . <p> There was so much going on that I barely registered the arrival of Mr. Kinney , Daddy 's foreman and " right-hand man " from the mill , still dressed in his work clothes , holding his hat . Mr. Kinney went straight to my Aunt Judy and took her aside for a whispered conference , then left without speaking to Mama or me . He ducked his head and looked away as he went out . And the afternoon wore on , the longest day I had ever lived through , the longest day in the world . <p> It was almost dark when Daddy finally came home . Jinx and I were sitting in the seat at the bay window , balancing plates of ham sandwiches and potato salad on our knees , when a red car pulled up and stopped at the end of our walk . I thought I had seen the car before , but I could n't remember where . I peered through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , and then I could see him plain in the light from the yard lamp . He looked years older than he had the day before . <p> Daddy stared at our house , then leaned into the car to say something . In a moment he straightened and looked at the house again . Then the driver 's door opened and Carroll Byrd got out , wearing pants , her hair streaming down her back . She walked around to Daddy , who put out his arms and held her to him for a long time , so long I could n't believe it . <p> Did n't he know that this house was full of people who could look out the windows and see him , see what he was doing ? Did n't he care ? Did n't he care at all about Mama , or me , or anybody except himself ? <p> Finally , Carroll Byrd stepped back from Daddy , who touched her cheek once and then turned and came slowly up the walk , as if to his execution . Carroll Byrd drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The funeral was held two days later at St. Michael 's , though Mason had not been there or to any other church for many years , as far as we knew . The sanctuary was packed with Mama and Daddy 's friends and lots of people from the mill . Mason 's wife did not show up , but two of her daughters did , trashy girls in their late teens with curly red hair who cried like they meant it and told Mama that Mason had been a great stepfather to them . I know this meant more to her than anything else that was said at Mason 's funeral . She clung to their arms , and gave them money later . <p> Beth could not come east for the funeral , as she was nearing the end of a difficult pregnancy , but Caroline came , of course , with Tom  --  my beloved Tom , who immediately made himself indispensable to everybody , with his good sense and calm , reasonable manner . <p> After the funeral , Tom and Grandmother stood by the door shaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Caroline and Mama clutched each other on the loveseat and cried . Suddenly they looked like beautiful strangers to me-the big disheveled blonde , the pretty girl with mascara streaking her face . My old terror came back as I realized I did n't have a clue as to what their family had been like , how they had acted with each other , who they were before I was born . I got that same feeling in my stomach that I 'd had at the beach when we spied on Mr. Womble . Daddy talked on the telephone back in his study with the door closed , though Aunt Judy tried several times to get him to come out and " act responsible . " ( Imagine Aunt Judy saying this to Daddy ! ) <p> Finally , Grandmother left her post in the front hall and walked back there , magisterial in her black suit . I followed , slipping into the stairwell . I understood that Grandmother had been dressing for a funeral for years , and now was in her element . She went into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sure what she said , but it ended with her marching out and Daddy shouting , " Goddamnit , Mama ! " and slamming the door . <p> " But John ! " Grandmother had apparently thought of something else to say . She tried the knob , but he had locked it . She was furious , I knew , but when she saw me , her face fell into its customary haughty expression and she sailed into the living room without another word , to shake hands and smile some more . <p> I headed to the kitchen for a Coke , where I discovered Aunt Judy in the process of getting really drunk . She 'd done absolutely as much as she could , goddamnit ! she said . Now it was out of her hands . Nobody could blame her . <p> It seemed to be out of everyone 's hands , in fact . <p> I got back to the living room just in time to hear Caroline announce her pregnancy . Tom stood beside her , straight as a soldier , grinning from ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been kicked in the stomach . <p> " Oh , John , " Mama began calling . " Oh , John ! " She blew her nose . " Oh , John , come here , darling , we 've got some good news after all , even on this awful day ! Oh , John ... " she kept calling , but Daddy never came . <p> I spent the night at Jinx 's . Locked in the bathroom , we smoked a whole pack of her mother 's Kent cigarettes , which tasted awful . Then I slept for twelve hours solid . I awoke to find Jinx and her mother sitting on the end of Jinx 's extra twin bed , staring fixedly at me . <p> " Thank goodness , " Jinx 's mother said in a fuzzy , distracted way that was not like her at all . " Oh , Jenny , honey . " <p> I could tell she knew everything , all about Daddy and Carroll Byrd , which probably meant everybody else knew everything , too . What a relief ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . keep such a secret until I felt the weight of it leave me like a physical thing , like a rock being lifted off the top of my head . For the first time in months I could cry-which I did . I cried and cried and cried , for Mama and Daddy and Carroll Byrd and poor , terrible , scary , dead Mason , who had been the sweetest child , and for myself , and especially for the loss of Tom Burlington , who would never be free to love me now . <p> This is where everything gets hazy in my mind . By the time I went home , Daddy was gone . I did not have to be told where he was . I knew he was with her . Mama was brightly , determinedly cheerful , wearing the same crazy smile that had scared me so much before . She was in the kitchen cooking up a storm , banging the pots around , while Ronda , our maid , watched anxiously . <p> " Oh , hello , dear , " Mama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soup , I think potato soup is just so comforting somehow , and Lord knows we can all use a little comfort , is n't that right , Ronda ? " <p> " Yes ma'am , " Ronda said . <p> Mama wore a bright-green knit suit with lots of gold jewelry , including her famous charm bracelet . I looked to see if Daddy 's Deke pin was still on it . It was . <p> " Jenny , " she said brightly , stirring . " Did you hear that your daddy has had to go out of town on an extended business trip ? He said to give you his love and tell you he 'll be back before long . I made this potato soup for you , honey , " she added . " I know it 's your favorite . " <p> It was the first time I had ever been unable to eat . Mama did n't even try . She just sat across from me , drumming her beautiful red nails on the table rat-a-tat-tat and sipping from a tall Kentucky Derby glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it was vodka ; and she filled it up again as soon as the level dipped below half , and did not put it down for the next two weeks . She never quit talking either , to me or Ronda or Jinx 's mother or one or another of her friends . They had arranged it among themselves so that someone was always with her , and every day when I came home from school , there they 'd be , Mama and her visitor ( Buffy , Bitsy , Helen , Jane Ann , etcetera ) , talking a mile a minute , with Ronda hovering in the background . Mama kept cooking nice little suppers for me , which we never ate . Dinnertime seemed to be my time to entertain her , while Ronda and her friends went home to their own families , before Aunt Judy showed up to spend the night . <p> Mostly we read movie magazines and talked about the lives of the stars . So much had happened lately that we had a lot to catch up on . Judy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple , " Cary Grant and Betsy Drake , had parted amicably . Jean Seberg was engaged to some Frenchman she 'd met in the romantic resort town of St. Tropez , on the Riviera , while she was filming Bonjour Tristesse . Tyrone Power married Debbie Minardos in a little chapel in her hometown of Tunica , Mississippi . <p> We were still reveling in Grace Kelly 's fairy-tale wedding to Prince Rainier and in the Robert Wagner/Natalie Wood marriage . We could tell that Janet Leigh and Tony Curtis were truly in love ; Mama explained to me that their union had brought Tony ( born Bernard Schwartz ) " up into a better class of people . " And Kim Novak was dating Sammy Davis Jr. , which outraged Mama . I did n't care . I thought Kim Novak was beautiful , and I planned to paint my room lavender , just like hers , whenever Mama would let me . <p> I still could not understand how the gorgeous Marilyn Monroe could have married such a dried-up pruny old guy as Arthur Miller , though Mama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have their charms , " she told me , sipping from her glass , ignoring the fried chicken she had just cooked . This was as close as Mama ever came to mentioning Daddy . <p> After supper we watched television together , an unaccustomed treat  --  Daddy did n't like for the set to be on in the evenings except for Huntley-Brinkley or an occasional dramatic production . But now Mama and I watched everything , and she kept up a running commentary . Her favorites were the variety shows , where she could see the most stars . I thought Ed Sullivan and the Hit Parade were OK , but I liked Dinah Shore the best , especially the end of the show when Dinah sang , " See the U.S.A. in your Chevrolet , " and blew a big , smacking kiss to the studio audience . Mama invariably turned to me at this point and whispered , " Well , of course you know she has Negro blood . " <p> " How do you know that ? " I asked the first couple of times Mama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Oh , honey , everybody knows it ! " Whether they did or not , Mama believed it implicitly , as she believed in flying saucers and segregation and reincarnation and linen napkins and Estee Lauder and not going swimming for one hour after you have eaten lunch and not having milk with fish . <p> Mama and I watched television together until about nine o'clock , when Judy would show up to give Mama her pills and I 'd be free to do my homework or go to bed and read for as long as I liked . I was reading By Love Possessed ( pretty hot stuff ) , which had just arrived in a package from the Book-of-the-Month Club . I kept it under my bed . <p> We went on this way for three weeks , until that awful night when we were watching What 's My Line ? together . I really liked What 's My Line ? , feeling that its question-and-answer format offered good pointers for a combination spy and novelist such as myself . First , " the challenger " would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The challenger could be a man or a woman , either one . Then words would flash up on the screen , telling the audience what the challenger did for a living . The job was always really far-out  --  one man polished jelly beans , another put sticks in popsicles , another was a bull de-horner . I loved these occupations , which made me feel that the world was a much more open place than I had been led to believe . It was clear that I was destined to go to St. Catherine 's and make my debut , but after college , who knew ? I imagined coming on the show myself someday as the challenger , the youngest best-selling author in the world . Anyway , the panelists asked questions to figure out the challenger 's " line , " such as : <p> " Are you self-employed ? " <p> " Do you deal in services ? " <p> " Do people come to you ? Men and women ? " <p> " Are they happier when they leave ? " <p> " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> I imagined Carroll Byrd as the challenger , squirming while she tried to answer this question , cringing when Dorothy Kilgallen pointed at her and cried : " You are an ADULTERESS ! " <p> On the night I am thinking about , the challenger was a professional fire-eater , and the panel was closing in . " Oh , he 'll get it now , " I said to Mama , because it was Bennett Cerf 's turn , and he was the smartest , " do n't you think ? Hmmm ? Do n't you think ? " <p> When Mama did n't answer , I turned and saw that she had slumped sideways in the easy chair , her head too far down on her shoulder , like her neck was broken , exactly like a bird with a broken neck . Her overturned drink made a spreading stain on her silk print dress . I watched while the Kentucky Derby glass rolled slowly off her lap and onto the carpet . Then I got up and went to telephone Aunt Judy , who did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally I realized : Aunt Judy was already on her way . I stood by the door , not moving , until she got there . <p> Lots of things happened immediately after that . Daddy appeared and took Mama out of the local hospital and drove her to a " lovely place " in Asheville for a " nice little rest . " I would n't even speak to him . I stayed in my room smoking cigarettes until they were gone . Then I had a big fight with my grandmother , refusing to stay with her and Aunt Chloe , claiming I 'd rather be dead and would kill myself with a knife if they tried to press the issue . Nobody knew what to do . I had become a " problem child . " I hoped to stay with Jinx , but unexpectedly , Jinx 's mother balked at this ; Jinx and I were , she said , " not good influences " on each other . Furthermore , Aunt Judy " had had it " with all of us , she said , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ronda stayed with me until Daddy came back and got me and took me down to visit Mama 's cousins in Repass , SC , where I had never even been . I would n't go until Mama begged me on the phone , and then I had to . I had to do anything she wanted me to do . My mother 's cousin was named Glenda . They were sending me to her because she was a school principal whose home had " structure , " which I " needed , " and because she had a daughter about my age who was a " model girl " and would be my friend . <p> I doubted this , and did n't speak to Daddy the entire way down in the car , though he tried and tried to talk to me and never lost his patience , not even when he saw me spit in his Coke at a Howard Johnson 's . He just stared at me sadly , solemnly , like a tragic hero . Daddy had dark circles beneath his eyes now , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to me it seemed more like he was dying of it . I hated him . I hated him for being so weak , for loving her more than he loved us . I also hated Mama  --  for letting this happen , for getting sick , for going in the hospital . For abandoning me . I hated Aunt Judy for going to Bermuda , and my sisters for being so involved with their own jobs and babies and lives . I hated Jinx because she got to stay with her own happy family while I had to go live with complete strangers in South Carolina . <p> I already hated everybody I knew , so I was prepared to hate Cousin Glenda on sight . And what a sight she was ! Though I was told I had met her before , when I was little , I could n't remember ... and surely I would have remembered anybody as awful as this . Cousin Glenda looked like a fireplug , or maybe a built-in barbecue grill . She was five-by-five , wearing an orange suit with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ugliest shoes I had ever seen . Her hair was a bright-yellow lacquered helmet squished way down on her head . It was impossible for me to believe that she was related to Mama , or even that they had grown up together . I had heard Mama say that she and Glenda " did not always see eye to eye " on things . Now I realized this was a huge understatement . Cousin Glenda was as hard as Mama was soft , as practical as Mama was flighty , as ugly as Mama was pretty , as mean as Mama was sweet . <p> Cousin Glenda stood in the driveway with her arms crossed and her feet planted wide apart as we drove up . Behind her , their home was completely square , as square as she was , like a house made of building blocks . It was a plain two-story brick house with no shutters and no shrubbery , sitting smack in the middle of a square green yard , with a walk going up to the front door and one maple tree planted on each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " It was the first thing I had said all day . <p> Daddy turned off the car . " Honey , it 's only for a little while . You know that . It 's just until your mama gets out of the hospital . " <p> " I ca n't stay here , " I said . <p> " Honey , please . " <p> It occurred to me that Daddy might cry . <p> " Let 's get your things out , " he said . " This wo n't be for long , I promise . " <p> " Sure . " I sounded every bit as sarcastic as Buddy Womble . <p> Cousin Glenda rolled toward us like a tank . " I 'll take that , " she said to Daddy , grabbing my suitcase . " Come on now , Jennifer , " she ordered , and I surprised myself by getting right out of the car . She grabbed my elbow . Her grip was iron . " OK , John , I 'll take care of her . Send a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's it , then . " <p> Cousin Glenda was talking at my father instead of to him , like he was some lower order of being , and suddenly I felt my allegiance shifting in an alarming about-to , back toward Daddy . ! could be as mean to him as I wanted , as mean as he deserved , but I could n't stand for anybody else to be mean to him . <p> " Daddy , Daddy , Daddy , " I said , and he stepped over quickly and gave me a tight , fierce hug . " It 'll be all right , Jenny . It will . It wo n't be long , you 'll see . " Close up , Daddy smelled like cigarettes and Aqua Velva , his old smell , and then I loved him more than anybody in the world and wanted to die for hating him so much and spying on him and spitting in his Coke at Howard Johnson 's and all the many other awful things I 'd ever done . <p> " Come along now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice that made you do everything she said . <p> " You 're hurting my arm . " I tried to shake her off , but she held on like a bulldog . <p> " I know all about you , Miss , " she announced with great satisfaction , pulling me toward the house . " We 're going to put the quietus on you . " <p> The quietus ! What was that ? I was terrified . But I soon learned that this was simply one of Cousin Glenda 's favorite sayings . She was always going to " put the quietus " on somebody , always telling somebody to " get a grip . " She 'd say , " Your mother called today , Jennifer , and said how much she hated doing all the things she has to do up there , such as exercise , and I said to her , ' Billie , get a grip ! ' I just hope she was taking it in . " <p> Cousin Glenda quoted herself endlessly , infatuated by her own good advice . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my office all upset because we had to cut fifteen minutes off second period for the fire drill , and I said , ' Mister Johnson , get a grip ! ' " etcetera . Puffed up and blustery , Cousin Glenda reminded me of a blowfish , and I soon understood that I did n't really need to be afraid of her . She was all hot air and good intentions . Growing up as one of Mama 's poor relations in Charleston , she had idolized Mama for her sweetness and generosity . Now that Mama was in trouble and without brothers and sisters , Cousin Glenda was more than willing to step in and help out . She would shape me up . She would make me get a grip . And for a fact it was easier to get a grip in that household than in ours , where so many things were too slippery to hold onto and so many words were never spoken and the rules changed all the time . <p> The rules in Cousin Glenda 's house were inflexible , and everybody toed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-faced and lantern-jawed but clearly nice , who could n't get a word in edgewise with Cousin Glenda around , repeating word for word every conversation she 'd ever had . I ca n't remember hearing Raymond speak once during the whole time I was there , though this ca n't be true . He grinned a lot , however , as though he got a big kick out of Cousin Glenda-out of us all , in fact . Raymond would never leave his wife , this was clear . They had been married at eighteen , and he had worked the same job in the post office for twenty-three years . He was n't going anywhere . <p> Rayette , my model cousin , turned out to be a junior version of her mother . One year older than me , freckled , sturdy , and curly-haired , she had a wide , plain face and big cornflower-blue eyes and not one ounce of irony or guile . I knew immediately that she would never , ever , understand my spying , which I would never tell her about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rayette was fascinated by me , though , especially by all my cool stuff : the red plastic case containing my 45 rpm records ; my Tangee lipstick and fashionable clothes , especially the crinolines and my two appliqued circle skirts ; my castle-shaped jewelry box with its own lock and key containing my Add-a-Pearl necklace and Captain Midnight decoder ring and jade paperweight and fourteen separate items ( such as a ballpoint pen and a Jujube wrapper ) that had been touched by Tom Burlington . But Rayette did not have a jealous bone in her body . She seemed glad to have me there , and curiously enough I did not mind being there either , or following all their rules and their rigid schedule . <p> In fact I loved this schedule , which included getting up at the crack of dawn because we had to catch the schoolbus , saying the blessing before a huge breakfast including eggs and bacon and grits , and then making our own beds and washing the dishes ( no Ronda ) before we set out through the foggy lowland chill to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out our breath in puffy clouds and wait for the big yellow bus to come blasting out of the mist like an apparition and carry us away . Back home , Daddy or Ronda had always driven me to school . <p> Rayette 's was a hick school , as Jinx had predicted , but as the new girl I was more popular than I had ever been , and I reveled in it . All the girls wanted to sit next to me at lunch ; all the boys bumped into me in the hall , acting dumb . A 's were easy to come by . After school I 'd stay late with Rayette for her 4-H and Tri-Hi-Y meetings  --  clubs I would have scorned back home . They were just beginning a sewing project in 4-H , so I too got to make a terrible-looking bright-yellow blouse with a scoop neck and sleeves that did not fit the armholes and darts in the wrong place . I was intensely proud of myself . <p> Rayette was president of the Tri-Hi-Y , a Christian service club that pledged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over the county . While I was there , they were raising money to buy an artificial leg for a boy named Buster Briggs . Rayette called each meeting to order by banging on a table with a gavel . This gavel impressed me so much that I gave up espionage and literature on the spot and vowed to be just like her . I wanted to bang on a table with my gavel , to run clubs , to wear a huge cross around my neck , a cross so big it seemed to pitch me forward and weigh me down , and most of all , to be absolutely sure about everything in the world . <p> The main criterion in that house was , " What would Jesus think of this ? " Jesus did not think much of rock-and-roll , for instance . Specifically he did not like fast records that caused young people to move their bodies in sinful ways . He hated " Whole Lotta Shakin ' Goin ' On , " " Wake Up , Little Susie , " and " Blue Suede @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special case , but I was allowed to play " Que Sera , Sera , " " April Love , " and ( strangely ) " The Great Pretender . " Jesus was very picky . <p> He apparently prized neatness , cleanliness , and order above all things ; I imagined that the plastic runners on the carpet and the cellophane covers on all the lampshades were His idea . I liked them myself , as they gave the living room such a weird , ghostly aspect , and the runners popped and crinkled nicely when you walked on them . Lots of things had covers in my cousins ' house  --  the toaster , the mixmaster , and the blender wore little matching pique jackets with rickrack around the edges ; the Kleenex box and the Jergens lotion had crocheted skirts ; the toilets all featured big fuzzy pads . <p> And everything had its place . I learned this fast . Rayette burst into tears the third day I was there because I had borrowed her hairbrush ( without asking ) and put it back in the wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was supposed to be when she tried to find it . Pearl Harbor ! This threw Rayette for such a loop that I never did it again , striving for a Jesusy order as great as hers . I got into it . I put my shoes in a little row in my closet , as if some dainty princess was going to step into them at any minute . I rolled my socks into balls . I learned where all the dishes went , and everything in the refrigerator . I loved to fill the bird feeder and put away the groceries , tasks that had to be done just so . <p> Another virtue right up there with order was being prepared . " Jesus will look after you , honey , " Cousin Glenda often said , " but He expects you to do what you can . " Therefore the family was prepared for any possible crisis , with a first-aid kit , emergency flares , a snakebite kit , a shotgun , and , wonder of wonders  --  a Bomb Shelter ! <p> Rayette did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was used to it  --  but I thought it was the coolest thing I had ever seen , the coolest place I 'd ever been . You went down into the Bomb Shelter through a trapdoor in the garage . This was an orange metal door with a big scary black XXX on it . It was impervious to radiation . Then you went down a dozen steep steps into the cavelike Bomb Shelter itself , which was equipped with all the necessities for nuclear war , including : a Geiger counter with its $98.50 price tag still attached ; a two-way portable radio ; a pick and shovel ; a chemical toilet ( Rayette explained that you would put a blanket over yourself , for privacy , when you used it ) ; mattresses and blankets ; a sterno stove ; a fire extinguisher ; paper products ; canned water ; canned food and drinks . It was always cold in the Bomb Shelter , which was lit by a faint blue light that buzzed with a thrillingly extraterrestrial sound . I loved to sit in the Bomb Shelter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen window while I washed dishes , thinking , The Bomb Shelter is right out there ! Nobody knows it , nobody can possibly tell , nobody knows it but us ! I spent as much time in the Bomb Shelter as I could without attracting too much attention , heading down there whenever we were n't at school or doing chores or praying or going to church . <p> We went to church every time they cracked the door . Even at home , we 'd pray at the drop of a hat . We prayed that I would make an A on my math test , that the lady up the street would see the light ( what light ? ) , that Mama would get well soon and Daddy would see the error of his ways and Jesus would forgive him , that Buster Briggs would get a new leg , that the family 's station wagon would make it through the winter without a new clutch , that the Tri-Hi-Y bake sale would be a big success . Cousin Glenda would throw up one hand , bow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it ; then we 'd all have to bow our heads and pray , too . Used to the sedate and abstract Book of Common Prayer , I was as startled by the personal nature of these prayers as by their frequency . <p> The church was even more unnerving . It was very plain , a cinder-block building that looked like it might have been a little grocery at one time . There was nothing to suggest it was a church except a hand-painted sign over the front door that read BIBLE CHURCH OF GOD , ALL ENTER IN . I knew that " enter in " was redundant , like " Ford car , " yet I found it mysteriously compelling , like an invitation to a foreign country . And I was fascinated by what went on inside : clapping , singing , crying , hugging , and shouting amen-I had never seen anything like it at St. Michael 's , that 's for sure . " Bible " was the key to everything . " If it 's not Bible , we do n't believe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cousin Glenda explained . <p> " But the Bible was written a long time ago , " I pointed out . " Before airplanes or electricity or anything . How do you know Jesus wants you to have electricity ? How do you know Jesus wants you to have a telephone ? How do you know He does n't like the Everly Brothers ? How do you know He does n't like eye makeup ? There was n't any makeup at all back in the Bible days , so  --  " <p> " Jennifer , Jennifer , " Cousin Glenda said , hugging me , " get a grip . " <p> I tried to . I had given up spying , except for one quick peep into Rayette 's bedroom window to ascertain that yes , she really did have breasts as big as softballs , obscured by the homemade shirtwaist dresses and blocky sweaters she always wore . I did not have the heart to spy on Cousin Glenda and Raymond , however . The prospect of them actually taking off their clothes was too awful to contemplate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I still did n't know . ) But I was sure they had done it only once , whatever it was , in order to conceive Rayette and procreate the earth . <p> Rayette ( big as a woman , dumb as a post ) soon became my personal servant and bodyguard . She carried my books to school , ironed my clothes , and once even hemmed a skirt for me . Cousin Glenda shook her head at this , smiling . " That 's exactly how I was with your mama , " she said . " Just exactly . I was three years younger than Billie , and if Billie said ' Jump ! ' I said , ' How high ? ' I used to follow her around , but if I got on her nerves , she never let on , at least not to me . " <p> " What was Mama like as a little girl ? " I asked . I could n't imagine . <p> " An angel , " my tough cousin Glenda answered immediately . " Oh , Jennifer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was no angel , but I was trying-trying not to spy , trying to get a grip , trying to be good . Now that I realized how good it was possible to be , I realized how bad I 'd always been ; and I got the idea that it was my fault somehow , everything that had happened , and that if I could just be good enough , Mama and Daddy might get back together . So I was almost killing myself being as good as I possibly could , which did not come naturally ; but before long , sure enough , it worked . <p> Daddy called to say that he had happy news , that Mama was improving , and we might all take a vacation together when she got out of the hospital . He did not mention Carroll Byrd . I was elated . I knew I had done this by being so good . I doubled my efforts , making three dozen brownies to sell at the Tri-Hi-Y bake sale to buy Buster Briggs that new leg . <p> Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I sort of knew it , though we had not exchanged two words . His name was Harlan Boyd . He was a big deal , the star football player . A jock . His neck was as thick as his head , which made his head and his neck together look like a massive fence post topped off by his fuzzy brown flattop . He had big square jock shoulders and wore his red-satin letter jacket all the time , with blue jeans . ( This was before blue jeans got popular . Then , in Repass , they meant you were poor . ) Harlan Boyd was in Rayette 's grade , but he was in my math class . He was big for his age , and came from a " troubled home . " He lived out in the swamp with his uncle , under conditions too awful to imagine , yet he could catch a football like a dream and run like hell . These skills would be his ticket out of there , but he did n't know it yet , had not thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought much of anything yet , at age fifteen , that day at the bake sale . <p> The sale was held in front of the courthouse , right in the center of Repass , one Saturday in early December . Cousin Glenda , the Tri-Hi-Y sponsor , had brought two card tables from home in the station wagon . Rayette rode with her , and they were just getting everything set up as I arrived . Though I was trying my dead-level best to be good , I did not like to be identified with Cousin Glenda in public situations and so had turned down her offer of a ride and walked to the square by myself , bearing my platter of brownies . Now I hung back behind the giant live-oak tree while Cousin Glenda ( wearing the world 's largest car coat ) bossed everybody around . <p> " Susan , put that right there ! " she barked . " Rayette , pull the tablecloth down ! Peter , go get some change from the Rexall ! " Cousin Glenda was a world-class expert on bake sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know she ought to be embarrassed , did everything her mother told her , smiling placidly . I stayed hidden until everything had been set up to Cousin Glenda 's satisfaction . <p> " All right now , boys and girls , " she trumpeted , flinging up her arm , " let us join hands and pray together , and ask our Heavenly Father to bless this bake sale and all this good food and all the proceeds therefrom , and may Buster Briggs get his new leg ASAP , amen . " <p> Looking sheepish , the kids dropped one another 's hands like hot potatoes while Cousin Glenda stomped off to her station wagon to smoke a cigarette ( Jesus did not mind for adults to smoke ) , and I sallied forth with my brownies . <p> I 'm still not sure how it happened . All I know is that one minute I was holding the brownies in front of me like a sacrificial offering , and the next minute they were flying through the air like little UFOs , and I was pitching forward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally slammed into the wide , solid chest of Harlan Boyd , propelling him backward , overturning one of the card tables and sending pound cakes and homemade bread and fudge everywhere . It was awful , the most humiliating thing I had done in my life , and it ended at last with me and Harlan Boyd splayed out on the ground , my cheek smashed into the letters on his football jacket , RR for Repass Rattlers . The letters felt scratchy and wonderful against my cheek . I could hear my pulse beating in my ears , so loud I thought briefly I might be having a heart attack . <p> " Jennifer , Jennifer , Jennifer ! " squealed Rayette . " Are you OK ? " <p> Then Cousin Glenda was there too , pulling us up , brushing us off , setting everything to rights . I wanted to die . I stood to the side with Rayette cooing over me and would not even look at Harlan Boyd , who kept trying to say something to me . I had pink icing all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way below my skirt so everyone could see . Cousin Glenda drove me home to change . I told her I 'd walk right back , though I had no intention of coming back , ever , or of ever speaking to any of those kids again , especially not to Harlan Boyd , whose athletic letter had made a red mark like a rope burn on my cheek . <p> After I showered I kept touching it , looking at my face in the mirror . Finally I put on clean slacks and a sweater , but I just could n't find it in me to start back over to the bake sale . Instead I wandered around the still , sunny house by myself . It was the first time I had ever been there alone , I realized , and it put me in mind of home , where I had had the run of the house and done whatever I wanted . I started feeling spacy and weird , detached from myself , between things . <p> The doorbell rang . I opened it to find Harlan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stoop . Though red-faced , he spoke up bravely : " I just wanted to see how you was , " he said . <p> " I 'm OK , " I told him . " Come on in . " I grabbed his sleeve , quickly pulled him inside and shut the door . Now that I had him there , however , I had no idea what to do with him . " My name is Jenny , " I said stupidly . <p> " I know that , " Harlan said . " You 're not from around here , are you ? " <p> " No , " I said . " I 'm just staying with my cousins until my parents get out of the hospital . They were in a train wreck , " I added . <p> " Aw , shoot , " Harlan said . " That 's awful . Are they going to be OK ? " <p> " Nobody knows , " I said dramatically , mysteriously . " Come here , I want to show you something . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ham , then pulled him down the hall and through the kitchen and into the empty garage , over to the orange XXX door . We paused before it . I was breathing hard . <p> " Do you know what this is ? " I asked . <p> " You sure are pretty , " Harlan said loudly . This announcement appeared to surprise him as much as it did me . He immediately turned fiery red and ducked his head and started stamping his feet in their big , uncool work boots . <p> Hick , I thought . Swamp boy . " Come on , " I said , and pulled the door up and pushed him ahead of me , down the stairs . " This is a Bomb Shelter , " I said . <p> " No kidding , " Harlan said . " Well , I 'll be darned . ' " <p> I was thrilled to see the entwined rattlesnakes on the back of his jacket disappearing into the gloom . I shut the door and followed , showing him everything : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though I did not go into detail about the chemical toilet . <p> " Let 's sit here , " I said , patting the pile of mattresses . " Let me get you something to drink . " I opened tiny cans of orange juice for each of us and clinked mine against his in a toast . " Cheers ! " I said . I knew my sophistication was knocking him out . He kept grinning at me , forgetting to drink his juice , while I downed mine in one sophisticated gulp and broke open a package of fig newtons . <p> " Care for a cookie ? " I said , knowing that Cousin Glenda would kill me . " A little refreshment ? " There in the humming blue light of the Bomb Shelter , I turned into the perfect hostess , exactly as prescribed in Teen magazine ( " When he comes to your home , have refreshments ready ... " ) . <p> Harlan Boyd set his juice can down carefully on the sterno stove . " C'mere , " he said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good ; I did n't think about anything . I dropped the fig newtons on the floor and scooted over there to get myself kissed by a boy for the first time ever , and I have to say it was just fine , and the whole world dropped out from under me for I do n't know how long while Harlan Boyd and I mashed our lips together , mouths closed , and then open as he stuck his tongue into mine ( Teen had not mentioned tongues ) . I was lying partway back on the mattress by now , with him on top of me , when suddenly I felt this hard thing like a stick between us . What was it ? I struggled upward like a swimmer surfacing through thousands of feet of water . Uh-oh . What would Jesus think of that ? <p> But it was all over anyway , because Cousin Glenda 's station wagon pulled into the garage just then , and we could hear the car doors slamming and Cousin Glenda and Rayette calling my name , getting closer and closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cousin Glenda always knew everything . <p> Since there was no other way out of the Bomb Shelter , Harlan and I sat there side by side , buddies at the end of the world , until the orange door opened and Cousin Glenda came clomping downstairs like the wrath of God . <p> By the time Daddy appeared to take me away , Christmas had come and gone and I had repented of my behavior in the Bomb Shelter and was being totally good again , or as good as possible , newly aware of my potential for backsliding . Harlan Boyd never spoke to me again . He dropped out of Tri-Hi-Y and would n't even look at me in math class , where he got a D-for the semester . <p> It was over . I knew he still loved me , though , with the hopeless kind of love my Uncle Mason had felt for his ex-wife , a love so strong it had caused him to go out and cut somebody . I did n't think Harlan would do that , though I sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also he had basketball practice every day after school , so he was very busy . Anyway , I would be far , far away soon , in Key West , where Mama and Daddy were going to " patch up their marriage , " a geographical cure prescribed by Mama 's doctors . <p> But I hated to leave Repass , which astonished Mama and Daddy , who looked puzzled as they stood waiting while I sobbed wildly , hugging first Rayette and then Cousin Glenda , while Cousin Raymond stood like a tree by the door . <p> " Now come on , Jennifer . " Cousin Glenda finally disentangled herself from my frantic arms . " What did I tell you ? " <p> I had to smile . <p> Rayette smiled . <p> " Get a grip , " we all said together , and I started laughing in spite of my tears . <p> Even though Daddy had bought us a new car for the occasion , a silvery-gray fish-tailed Cadillac , the long drive to Florida was grim . Mama and Daddy sat up front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to myself . There was a seat divider I could pull down to make a little table if I wanted to draw or write . I had a shopping bag containing a white New Testament , with my name embossed on the front in gold , a good-bye gift from my cousins ; a copy of ' Twixt Twelve and Twenty by Pat Boone , a gift from my grandmother ; Rayette 's Rattler yearbook from last year ; the yellow blouse I had made in 4-H ; and The Search for Bridey Murphy , which ! had been dying to get my hands on . Mama had just finished reading it . At the bottom of the bag was my old jewelry box , all locked up , and a big new auxiliary jewelry box containing the stale package of fig newtons and the Donald Duck orange juice can touched by Harlan Boyd . I had resurrected my notebook and brought it along to record my thoughts and observations , though I had sworn off both espionage and literature at least until I could get my parents through this crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of my notebook . It said GOOD DEEDS at the top , and the days of February were numbered down the left margin with a line drawn out from each . I had done this laboriously , with a ruler , before leaving my cousins ' . We would be gone for a month , and I planned to do a good deed every day-thirty good deeds , which ought to be enough to bring even Mama and Daddy back together . <p> I had my work cut out for me , though . It would be a challenge . They sat as far apart as possible on the big front seat , as remote from each other as planets . They were both smoking a lot ( Mama , Newports ; Daddy , Winstons ) , making the air in the new Cadillac dense and blue and wavy . My eyes watered all the way down through South Carolina and Georgia , until it grew warm enough for us to crack the windows . <p> Cousin Glenda 's reaction upon seeing Mama had been the same as mine : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mama had simply lost her luster . She had become a thinner , paler version of herself , quieter and more hesitant . Cousin Glenda 's final instructions ( " Now you all just forget about everything and have a good time , you hear ? " ) seemed harder and harder to follow the farther we traveled . <p> It also became clear that I was absolutely necessary to this trip , as the only remaining link between Mama and Daddy . They were trying to salvage their marriage for me , and the only way to do it seemed to be through me . So I was consulted on everything : where to spend the night , for instance , hotel or motel ? I picked the Palm Courts , a pink stucco motel where Mama and I shared a tiny square room and bath while Daddy had one to himself . Mama got ready for bed like she was in a trance-brushing her teeth , creaming her face with Noxzema , taking a lot of pills . Barbie Has a Nervous Breakdown , I thought , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clothes she had just thrown over a chair , and was rewarded for this when she put them all back on the next morning , the same exact outfit , something she would never have done in the past . <p> My parents asked me where to eat lunch , whether to play the radio , whether to stop at the Bok Singing Tower or not ( not ! ) , whether to stop at Weeki Wachee Springs ( yes ! ) . I loved Weeki Wachee Springs , where beautiful girls swam in underwater caverns with oxygen tanks on their backs , among brilliant angel fish . I determined to come back when I was grown up and could get a swimming job . <p> My parents did not come down to the underwater viewing room at Weeki Wachee Springs . They did not appear to be at all interested in the girl divers or in the fish or in anything . They sat on the low stone wall outside the entrance waiting patiently for me to emerge , not talking , smoking . They looked like prisoners blinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour until shark-feeding time , and they did n't even complain about that . This is when I realized that I could make them do anything I wanted on this trip . Anything . I was in charge . <p> Mama pulled out her compact and looked at herself the minute we got back in the car . " Oh , no ! " she started sobbing . " I got sunburned ! I did n't think I could get burned so early in the year , but this Florida sun is just so hot . ... " Mama went on and on . I did n't see what she was all upset about , but at least she was talking ; it was the most she had said on the whole trip . " Honey , " she said to me , " ask your daddy if he can get me some Solarcaine and some more Noxzema . " <p> " Daddy , can you do that ? " I asked , and he pulled off at the very next drugstore , a huge Rexall with a big Coppertone sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I volunteered , and Mama thrust a ten-dollar bill over the seat . <p> " No , I 'll go , Jenny , " Daddy said . <p> " No , I 'll do it , Daddy ! " I had already decided to count this as my good deed for the day . " Solarcaine and Noxzema , right ? " Daddy jumped out of the car and made a grab for the money , but I danced away , waving it . " I 'll be back in a minute , " I yelled . <p> " Damn it , " Daddy said . <p> " Jenny , get me some Newports , too , " Mama called . <p> " Goddamnit , " Daddy said behind me . <p> I got the Solarcaine and the Noxzema ( a smell I will forever associate with Mama ) , plus some peanut M &M's; for myself , and went back to the car , where Mama sat with her head in her hands and Daddy stood leaning against his door , smoking furiously . Words seemed to hang in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant ! disappeared into the Rexall . I could n't leave them alone for even a minute ! What a responsibility ! I went around to Mama 's side of the car and put the little paper bag and the wad of change in her lap . " Oh , honey , just keep the change , " she said , so I put it in my pocket with the M &M's.; Good deeds are always rewarded , as Cousin Glenda had told me . <p> " Did you forget my cigarettes ? " Mama asked . <p> I cleared my throat . " No , " I said , fidgeting from one foot to the other . " You do n't need any more , either one of you , " I announced . " You all are both smoking too much , and you 'll make yourselves sick . " <p> Mama gasped and started to cry . Daddy walked around the fancy front grillework of the Cadillac . " Now listen here , Miss , " he said , " you do n't talk to your mother that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her , and get in the damn car , and let 's get the hell out of here . " He looked at his watch as if we had some big schedule to keep . <p> I stood my ground . " Do n't say ' hell , ' " I said . " You curse too much , too . " <p> " Now just a minute , " Daddy said . " What 's going on here ? " For the first time , he really looked at me . <p> Mama stuck her head out the window and squinted at me , too-suddenly seeming , despite her puffy eyes , almost herself again . " Just what is going on here ? " she asked . " And take off that damn cross , for God 's sake , Jenny . Where in the world did you get that ugly old thing , anyway ? " <p> " Do n't say , ' For God 's sake , ' " I said . " What would Jesus think of that ? " <p> " Get in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I got in and slammed the door and prayed that Jesus would not punish Mama and Daddy for taking His name in vain , and that I could stay good enough for long enough to get them back together , and that Rayette would not miss her cross too much . <p> Central Florida was pretty boring , but I loved Miami , with lots of traffic and lots of people in the streets shouting and gesturing , speaking Spanish . " Lock the doors , " Mama instructed . " Jenny , do n't stare , " but I could n't help it as we cruised slowly through the city in our huge , shiny , smoke-filled car like a shark from Weeki Wachee Springs or a submarine from another civilization . <p> My father never took his eyes off the road . He seemed infinitely , infinitely sad to me , full of his grim resolve . He was doing the only thing he could do-I see this now  --  given the time and the place they lived , and the circumstances , and all the women who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mill , which Mr. Kinney was gamely running in Daddy 's absence . Being the man my father was , no other choice was possible . <p> And Mama  --  what was she thinking ? Over there with her pretty blond cap of curls and her milk-glass baby-doll face wreathed in smoke , so far from everything familiar ? Did she really want to save her marriage ? Or did she understand that she had any choice in the matter ? ! could n't tell . She remained vacant-eyed and silent . When they spoke to each other , it was with an exaggerated politeness I soon adopted , too , as if we were all sick . <p> The drive was interminable . Finally I asked Daddy why we were going there for our vacation anyway , when there were so many other places to go to that were much closer . " Well , Jenny , " Daddy said , " you know I was in the navy " -I nodded- " in fact I met your mother while I was in the navy , stationed in Charleston " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big blue eyes as if this were all news to her- " and before Charleston I was stationed in Key West , and I 'll tell you , I 've always wanted to go back . It 's not like anywhere else , you 'll see . It 's very exotic . And I just thought it would be good for us to take a trip together to someplace completely different , the three of us , after what we 've been through this past year . I thought we could use a little adventure . " <p> Daddy stubbed out his cigarette as he said " adventure , " glancing over at Mama . Mama looked out the window . I was mad at him for saying " what we 've been through this past year , " as if none of it was his fault , as if we 'd all been hit by a truck . I had to rub my cross and count backward from one hundred in order to stay good , to keep from saying something mean . <p> It was somehow easier once we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge with blue water under us and on either side , and then we were on Route 1 . " Originally the only way you could get to Key West was by boat or by rail , Jenny . A man named Henry Flagler started the railroad in 1905 , and it took him seven years to get all the way down . You can still see the tracks right over there , see that old trestle ? A storm blew the railroad away sometime in the ' 30s , " Daddy was saying , when all of a sudden Mama started to shriek . <p> " Key Largo ! Look , John , that sign says Key Largo ! You did n't tell me we were going to Key Largo , John . Oh , Jenny , is n't this exciting ? " <p> I sat up . It was one of Mama 's and my all-time favorite movies . <p> " Oh , stop , John ! I want to take a picture . " Mama had a brand-new Brownie camera that Daddy had bought her especially for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in it . Now we had to pull onto the sandy shoulder while she rummaged through her overnight case to find it , and then Daddy had to read the instructions to figure out how to load it . Meanwhile I shaded my eyes and breathed in the fishy air and looked at a long-legged bird who hopped nearer and nearer . He expected us to give him something , so I got him a Nab out of Mama 's pocketbook . Mama freshened her lipstick and fluffed her curls . <p> " OK now . " She walked over and leaned back against the sign that said Key Largo and smiled dazzlingly , a big red smile that came out of noplace . Daddy snapped the picture . <p> " Now you get in it with me , honey , " she said to me , and I did , and Daddy took that picture , too . I still have it : there 's a palm tree behind us , and the sun is in our eyes . Then we got back in the car and drove through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned out . It only took about two minutes . <p> " I 'm not sure they actually filmed it here , " said Daddy , who knew they had n't . <p> " Oh , of course they did ! " Mama said . " It 's named Key Largo , is n't it ? Silly . " For a minute she sounded just like herself again . <p> Humphrey Bogart had died only two years earlier , in 1957 , ending a marriage that Mama and I were just crazy about . We knew the facts by heart . Everybody had thought Lauren Bacall was too young for him when they met in 1943 ( she was nineteen , he was forty-four ) , but they had been blissfully happy together , against all odds , and she had nursed him devotedly when he got cancer ; on his deathbed , Bogey 's last words were for her : " Good-bye , Kid . " Lauren Bacall never got over him , of course . How could she ? I thought about it . Clark Gable never got over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane crash , though he tried to . He kept marrying other people , but nobody else ever really took . And what about Spencer Tracy , who had loved Katharine Hepburn for years though he never left his wife ? <p> Then I had this awful thought : Why should it be any different for Daddy and Carroll Byrd ? What if Daddy was just pretending to patch up the marriage , knowing he would never be able to give up Carroll Byrd ? Or what if he was really trying to give her up and could n't ? I watched him carefully as he drove us down the Keys . But unlike Mama , who was all on the surface , all open , too open , Daddy was hard to read . His face betrayed nothing . <p> We ate supper at a place called the Green Turtle Inn , which had a cannery ( named Sid and Roxie 's ) right across the road where they canned turtle meat . Yuck ! It was on the menu , too-and Daddy ordered the turtle soup . Mama asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring defiantly at Daddy . I ordered a hamburger . It was a confusing , jumbled-up restaurant with mismatched tables and chairs and all kinds of people , some of them very loud . Nobody was dressed up . It was not like any restaurant I had been to before . As we were leaving , a fight broke out at the bar . " Do n't look at anybody , " Mama said , clutching my shoulder and pushing me ahead , and we got out of there , and we did not look at anybody or mention Mason . <p> No one ever mentioned Mason 's death , or Mama 's stay in the hospital , or Carroll Byrd . All the way down the Keys , what we did not say seemed as real as what we did say , like the shadowy railroad alongside the highway with its ghost bridges spanning the sea . I kept wishing Cousin Glenda had come along , to haul everything out in the open and pray over it . <p> I started getting really excited on the Seven Mile Bridge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide , that it seemed we were entering another world . It had not occurred to me that water could be so many different shades of blue . Sometimes I saw dark shadows ( sharks ? rays ? ) moving under it and cloud shadows moving over it . <p> We touched land again briefly at Bahia Honda , then crossed the water again to Big Pine . Daddy solemnly read all the road signs out loud , as if he were a travel guide or we were illiterate : Little Torch Key , Niles Channel , Summerland Key , Cudjoe , Sugarloaf . By now I had abandoned even Bridey Murphy and was leaning over the front seat so I could see everything as soon as they did . <p> We passed Stock Island and drove into Key West about suppertime . After the great expanses of water and the scruffy , unpopulated places we 'd come through , Key West was disorienting , a sudden , bright buzz of color and noise . <p> " Did you have a uniform like that ? " I asked Daddy as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pretty much , " Daddy said . " In fact , that young man might have been myself , thirty years ago . " This thought seemed to make him sad ; he cleared his throat and went on . " You 'll see a lot of navy personnel here right now because of the situation in Cuba , which is only ninety miles away . A dictator named Batista has just been ousted , and the rebels have taken over . " <p> " Castro , right ? " I knew all about this from the Weekly Readers we had to read in civics class at Repass Junior High . <p> Daddy looked impressed . " That 's right , Jenny . Fidel Castro is the rebel leader , a genuine hero . " Daddy was always for the people , for the underdog . His father had kept the unions out of the mill ; but after Granddaddy killed himself , Daddy welcomed them . This was only one of Grandmother 's many longtime grievances against Daddy . <p> We stopped for the red light at Truman and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the boys in uniform along the sidewalk . Several were as cute as Harlan , in exactly the same sweet , country way , which made me feel funny deep down in my stomach . But nobody was as cute as Tom Burlington . Nobody would ever be as cute as Tom Burlington . <p> " Well , I like Ike , " Mama said , irrelevantly . This had something to do with Castro , I believe . <p> It was exactly the kind of remark that used to make Daddy smile or pinch her cheek . Not now . Instead , he curled his lip in an ugly way . Luckily , Mama did not notice ; she was staring out the open window . " ! just wish you 'd look at all these flowers ! " she said . " I have never seen such vines . " <p> I had n't either . Nor had I seen anyplace that looked at all like Key West , with its old frame houses covered and sometimes literally hidden by lush vegetation , its dogs and cats and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of open doorways . I had never seen adults riding bicycles before ; yet it seemed to be a common form of transportation in Key West . People sat on their porches and balconies or stood chatting on the sidewalks , beneath the big-leafed trees . The light was green and golden . Everybody seemed to have all the time in the world . Nobody looked like us . <p> " We 're almost there , " Daddy said . <p> Mama reapplied her lipstick . We turned left onto Duval Street , and now I could see a glistening patch of ocean ahead . Daddy pulled into a motel named the Blue Marlin , with a huge fish on its sign . Mama and I waited in the car , under the portico , while he headed for the office , tucking his shirt down in back as he went . The motel was made of blue concrete , two stories in a U-shape around a good-sized pool featuring a diving board and a water slide and lots of lounge chairs and palm trees all around . " Wow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said to Mama , who was lighting a cigarette and did n't answer . Still , I was hopeful . The Blue Marlin was nice . But was it nice enough to get Mama and Daddy back together ? Mama went through that whole cigarette and lit another , blowing smoke rings out her window . I watched a neon-green lizard zip up a blue concrete wall . <p> " Why is this taking so long ? " Mama said finally . She looked like she was about to cry . <p> I was halfway out of the car on my way to find out when Daddy came through the plate-glass doors , fingering two keys , with a funny look on his face . " Jenny , get back in the car , " he said abruptly , and I did . Then Daddy got in too and closed his door and turned to look at us instead of starting the car . <p> " You 're not going to believe this , Billie , " he said slowly . <p> " What ? What is it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an instant mask of alarm . She had had too much bad news . <p> " Oh no , nothing like that . " Daddy smiled his new distant smile . " It appears that almost this entire motel has been taken over by the cast and crew of a movie they are shooting over at the navy yard . There are only four rooms left , and it turns out we 've got two of them . " Daddy jingled his keys . " They asked me a lot of questions . I had to swear that we were n't journalists or photographers . " <p> " Who did you say we are ? " I asked . It was exactly what I had been trying to figure out . <p> Daddy looked at me . " An American family , " he said firmly . I felt something very deep inside me relax . " But , Jenny , " Daddy added in a no-nonsense voice , " I promised that you would not bother the stars , do you hear me ? Or the crew , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your mother would want to stay here . But there are no other children at this motel , so you 'll just have to amuse yourself . You can meet some other kids down there , I imagine "  --  Daddy pointed toward the beach at the end of the street  --  " but you ca n't bring them here , and you can not bother anybody at this motel . Is that clear ? " Now he had his key in the ignition , but still he did not turn it . I knew he was speaking as much to Mama as to me . <p> " Yes , " I said . <p> " Which stars ? " Mama said . <p> " Well , there 's Dina Merrill , " Daddy said , " and Tony Curtis ... " <p> " Tony Curtis ! " Mama and I squealed together . Tony Curtis had just been voted the most popular young actor in Hollywood , following the big recent successes of The Defiant Ones and Some Like It Hot . Mama and I were crazy about Tony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . " And you just missed Janet Leigh , " he said . " She left yesterday . She was here for two weeks , apparently , on vacation . She 's not in this movie , though . " <p> " She 's gone back to California to be with the children , " Mama said automatically . " Kelly and Jamie . " <p> Daddy looked at her for a while . Then he cleared his throat and said , " That 's not all . " <p> " Who ? " Mama and I breathed together . Over the top of the seat , I clutched her hand . <p> " Cary Grant . " Daddy was trying to sound offhand . <p> " Cary Grant ! " We could n't believe it . The most gorgeous , the most elegant , the biggest star in Hollywood ! <p> " He 's got the bungalow and several of those end units . " Daddy pointed . " His secretary is here , and a number of other people . His whole staff . The man at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Of course he is , " Mama said . <p> I was not so sure of that . I sucked in my breath , thinking of his recent affair with Sophia Loren , on location in Italy . <p> Mama and I peered toward Cary Grant 's quarters but could n't see any activity beyond the pool and the pink bougainvillea that grew in profusion , shielding the bungalow . <p> " They 're still on location today , " Daddy said . " They do n't get back until about eight o'clock . They 're filming down at the navy yard , where they 've painted a submarine pink for this movie . The movie is named Operation Petticoat . So , if everything is understood , Jenny " -I bobbed my head vigorously  --  " then let 's get unpacked , girls ! " Daddy finally started the car and drove around back . <p> Our rooms were on the second floor . I insisted on helping Daddy carry the bags up , though he said I did n't have to . It was my good deed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connecting door into Mama and Daddy 's room , 209 , which was a suite with two beds and a rattan settee and coffee table and two armchairs and a tiny kitchenette . I was utterly charmed by the kitchenette , with its two-burner stovetop and miniature refrigerator . It had four of everything-four spoons , four forks , four knives , four plates , four glasses . <p> " You can go swimming before supper if you want to , " Mama told me , so I put on my bathing suit and headed for the pool while Daddy fixed gin-and-tonics for himself and Mama and pulled two chairs onto the balcony . <p> " Honestly , John , " Mama was saying behind me as I took off down the concrete stairs , " is that really true , about the movie company ? Did you make all that up ? " <p> " Scout 's honor , Billie , " Daddy said . <p> At least they were talking to each other . I took a running dive into the water . <p> If we rarely saw Cary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he had his own chef and took his meals mostly in his bungalow , where he held private parties as well . He rode to and from the set in a chauffeured limousine-which had been written into his contract , according to Mr. Rudy , the motel manager , our informer . Sometimes I sneaked out to the parking lot in the early morning to wash the windshield and polish the hubcaps of the limousine , though I was discouraged in this particular good deed by Rocco Bacco , Mr. Grant 's chauffeur . <p> Cary Grant often gave other cast members , especially the pretty young script girls and makeup girls , a ride in the limousine . Mama considered this very democratic of him ; she pronounced Cary Grant a " perfect gentleman . " I was a little disappointed in his looks , personally . He was so old , for one thing . He looked pretty much like any other old guy , for instance Dr. Nevins , our family physician back in Lewisville , or Ronnie Tuttle , Aunt Judy 's second husband . Cary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did like his accent , however . I liked the way he said " hot dog " at the cast cookout by the pool-as if the o 's were long instead of short . Mama said this was English . On that night Mama and I sat on our balcony , suspended over the crowd , so we could see everything : the gorgeous girls in their two-piece bathing suits , the muscly young men , two guys with beards ( was one of them the director ? ) , the tall , bitchy woman with red hair and glasses who seemed to be in charge of herding everybody around . We were right there to see her break into a terrible little tap dance ( everybody clapped politely ) and to see Tony Curtis do his Cary Grant imitation at Mr. Grant 's request , and then to see Tony Curtis get thrown in the pool by most of the crew , who soon joined him , swimming around in their clothes . Mama and I pulled our chairs up to the rail to watch . By then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a jewel in the fragrant night , full of impossibly good-looking people trailing wet clothes through the water . <p> Mama nudged me . " Hollywood hijinks , " she said . <p> Behind us , in their room , Daddy lay on one of the beds reading some big book , a biography . Sometimes he seemed amused by our reaction to the movie stars ; other times he seemed disgusted ; and that night , when we would n't leave our vantage point to go out for dinner , he had gone without us . We did n't care . We were perfectly happy to make a meal of potato chips and Fritos . We were n't about to leave the balcony , that was for sure , especially after they all jumped into the pool . I thought they might peel off their clothes at any moment , but nobody did . The party broke up soon after the swimming . People disappeared into their rooms or sat quietly in the lounge chairs around the pool , where there were so many plants and it was so dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anymore ; all we could see was the occasional flare of a match , and all we could hear was a low laugh now and then . <p> We never did see as many hijinks as we expected . The biggest surprise about the movie business was how hard everybody worked . The bus was waiting under the portico every morning at 7:30 ; by 7:45 , everybody , even Cary Grant , was gone . <p> Though I was always there to witness their departure , it was much too early for Mama , who had to make do with peeping from behind the blinds , after which she 'd fall asleep for two more hours while Daddy took a long walk all around the island or went fishing with Captain Tony . This left me free to roam the streets or swim in the pool or talk to Mr. Rudy or do anything else I wanted to , and often ! ' d fit in my good deed right then , so I 'd have it over with . <p> Sometimes I walked around the corner to the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved the gory statues and all the candles . I loved the feel of the scratchy , cold stone floor on my knees when I knelt . I loved the old people dressed in black , bent over and mumbling . Where did all these old people come from , anyway ? I never saw them on the beach or in the streets , that 's for sure . They looked dark and sad . ! knew they would die soon . The Jesus in the Catholic statues was a lot less peppy than the one back at St. Michael 's  --  and certainly than the Jesus in the church in Repass , who looked like a Ken doll . This Jesus ' brow was encircled by thorns , and He was always bleeding . It was hard to imagine what He would think of anything . He was too busy suffering . <p> But I loved the way I felt , all clean and new and bursting with goodness , when I popped back out of that church into the sunny Key West morning , like a girl in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at church , and if I could scrounge up enough , I 'd buy a candle from the sad lady and light it in honor of my uncle Mason and Carroll Byrd and Harlan Boyd . Whenever I did this , I 'd check in throughout the day to see my candle flickering in its red glass holder in the bank of candles burning in their alcove . I liked to see how long mine would last in comparison with the other candles , to make sure I got my money 's worth . The money came from Daddy , who always left pocket change scattered on the bureau . I 'd gather this up and take it with me on my morning good-deed run . <p> Other times I 'd give the money away to the bums who slept on the beach or to the children who lived over top of the Cuban grocery where I went to buy cigarettes for Mama and cafe con leche for myself . I came to love cafe con leche , and usually that was the only thing I 'd have for breakfast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrilled me to walk down the alley behind the Havana Madrid nightclub , where the strippers worked and " unimaginable things " went on in the back room , according to Mama . One of the signs on the front of the club said LIVE BOTTOMLESS , FRIDAY ONLY-a show I 'd have given anything to see . By midmorning the strippers were often out on a little wooden porch in back , sunning themselves and smoking and giggling like high-school girls . Two of them even looked like high-school girls , sisters maybe , not much older than me . <p> One day they were sitting together on a ratty chaise longue , looking at a fashion magazine , as I came along . " Hi ! " I said loudly , on impulse . Immediately , I could feel myself turning red all over . <p> " Hi ! " they said right back . They jumped up and came to the rail . Their fresh morning faces , without makeup , looked open and friendly . " Me Luisa , " the thin one said . " Me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun . Over the rail , they stared at me curiously . I felt like an exhibit  --  an American Girl , a member of an American Family , suddenly exotic in this locale . <p> " Me Jenny , " I said , thumping my chest in a gesture so awkward it made us all break into giggles . <p> " You smoke a cigarette , " Luisa said , offering her crumpled pack of Camels . <p> I loved the way she said " seegarette , " and resolved on the spot to say it exactly that way for the rest of my life . <p> " Do n't mind if I do , " I said , and took one . <p> " Rosa ! Luisa ! What are you doing ? This little girl does n't smoke ! " An older woman wearing a purple silk kimono stepped up behind them . She had a hard , leathery face and dyed red hair . <p> " Oh yes I do , " I assured her , putting the cigarette in the pocket of my camp shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> The woman grinned at me . " You have , huh ? " she said . " Well , as long as you 're here , why do n't you make yourself useful and get me a newspaper ? " She flipped me a dollar bill . <p> When I came back with the paper , she said , " Aw , honey , keep the change , " which I did . Then I got to go up on the porch and sit and smoke my cigarette and get my stubby fingernails painted by Rosa , who was doing everybody 's , while the woman turned immediately to the crossword puzzle and worked it in a flash , just like Daddy . Her name was Red . <p> Rosa and Luisa had other names-stripper names ( Candy Love , Nookie ) - for their acts . The billboard on the sidewalk in front of the club featured a photograph of Luisa/Nookie wearing only a G-string . She was much too thin , with no breasts to speak of . ( Rayette could have made a fortune at the Havana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . I was always worried about their health . Sometimes I brought them oranges , and one early morning I left a bottle of vitamin pills for them on the porch rail . The vitamins had disappeared by afternoon , but Rosa and Luisa never mentioned them to me . Of course , they did n't know I was the person who had brought them . But this did n't matter ; it was still a good deed . <p> Another place I loved to go was the graveyard , where I could always clean off a grave or two . There were about a million graves over there , a million people buried above the ground in white concrete boxes that you could walk on or sit on , and some of them had not been attended to for the longest time , you could tell . You could tell that nobody cared about those people anymore . Maybe everyone that ever knew them was dead . I 'd push dead brown leaves off the graves into little piles , then scrub away green mold with the snow scraper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all around admiring the graves and the statues  --  swans , angels , lambs , cut-off tree trunks , and even some little stone dogs on dogs ' graves . Those dogs are all dead now , I 'd think , and a thrill would shoot through me . I liked to subtract the dates and figure out how long the people had lived and try to imagine what they had died of . I liked to read their names and inscriptions , my favorite being : HERE LIES OUR HEART . <p> What if I died right now ? What if I was hit by a car on my way back to the motel ? What would they write on my grave ? I hoped it would be OUR JENNY , A GOOD GIRL . The thought of this made me cry and cry . Mason 's stone had only his full name on it , William Mason Rutledge , and the dates of his birth and death , and the carving of a bird in flight . They had buried him in our family plot at St. Michael 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old dead people in our family , people so old that even their names were all but gone from their stones . I decided I wanted to be buried in the nifty aboveground graveyard in Key West and informed Mama of this one morning when I got back to the motel and found her sunning by the pool . <p> She took off her dark glasses and sat up in the lounge chair to stare at me . " You what , honey ? " she said . <p> " Bury me in Key West , " I said . " In case I die , I mean . I want to be buried in the cemetery here , in one of those cool white concrete boxes , with an angel . A big angel . " <p> " Oh , honestly , Jenny , where do you get these crazy ideas ? And for heaven 's sake , take off that awful blouse , " Mama said . " I swear , it looks like somebody made it . " <p> We fell into a routine . I 'd go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or watch the movie stars with Mama . This way I got plenty of undivided attention , though I kept wishing my parents would do more things together . Sometimes they did , though Daddy always looked like a man fulfilling a duty , even after Mama started wearing flowers in her hair . <p> I loved those rare nights they went out without me . I 'd swim in the pool or run errands for Mr. Rudy or smoke Mama 's cigarettes or hide in the shrubbery in order to keep up with several romances I had taken an interest in . Then of course I would have to do a lot of good deeds to make up for all that . Then I 'd read East of Eden , which somebody had carelessly left by the pool ( I had finished Bridey Murphy ) , and then I 'd have to read my New Testament to make up for that . I was really busy , and was often completely exhausted by my efforts . <p> I could n't really tell whether the good deeds were working . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice ? too cordial ? ) , but so far they had never slept in the same bed . I knew this for a fact . I checked their room every morning . <p> So I redoubled my efforts-buying more candles , cleaning more graves , using up all Mama 's Kleenex on Cary Grant 's hubcaps , donating a jar of her Noxzema to the Havana Madrid girls . But we seemed to have reached a stalemate . Entranced by the stars , Mama was becoming herself again . But would this ever be enough for Daddy ? Could it be ? I knew that Frank Sinatra still loved Ava Gardner , even though she was in Spain living with a bullfighter . The bullfighter meant nothing to Frank . He was peanuts ; he was toast . Frank would always love Ava . <p> I prayed it would not be so for Daddy and Carroll Byrd . <p> It was hard to stay mad at Daddy . His lawyerlike quality of paying close attention was flattering ; he was winning me over again . I especially liked our fishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive up the Keys and go out with a one-eyed man named Captain Lewjack who gave me a mug of black coffee and a jelly glass of brandy and strapped me into a fighting chair and kept chanting , " C'm on baby , c'm on baby , hootchiekoo , " when I hooked a dolphin . <p> " Not a dolphin ! " I cried out at first , though Daddy and the captain assured me that it was n't that kind of dolphin . Still , the fish was so beautiful that it took my breath away when it leapt out of the water for the first time , a thing of lovely colors like a rainbow in the sun . It turned iron gray the very minute Captain Lewjack hit it on the head with a hammer after I pulled it in with Daddy 's help . <p> This was the same day that Daddy caught a marlin after a three-hour struggle , and I still have the photograph taken of him and the marlin on the dock when we went back in : Daddy sunburned and bare-chested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner of his mouth , wearing a Panama hat . It is impossible to tell that he had a broken heart , or that anything at all was the matter with him . <p> I have another photograph , of myself beside a giant jewfish that I hooked when we went out on Captain Tony 's party boat . This picture ran in the Key West newspaper , even though I did n't actually catch the fish ; it was brought up with block and tackle by several crew members . It was the ugliest fish I had ever seen . In the picture I 'm all but invisible behind somebody 's enormous sunglasses ; the caption reads , " Va . Miss Gets Big Jew . " <p> Daddy and I were fools for fish . We also took the glass-bottom boat trip out to the reef , where we peered into another world , another universe , with its softly waving sea fans and giant brain coral and gorgeous , deadly fire coral and silly octopuses and squids with big round doll-baby eyes . Daddy first took me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went again and again by myself . I liked to touch the barracudas and turtles . I especially liked the sharks , and never tired of leaning way over their open pen to watch them glide by ( constantly , endlessly , they could not be still ) , knowing that they would kill me if they could . They would love to kill me , and I loved to think about this . For a nickel you could feed them , which counted as one good deed . <p> What I did with Mama never varied . Shortly before nine every evening , just after dinner , we 'd go into the lobby of the Blue Marlin and settle ourselves on a large rattan sofa , which she called " the davenport . " <p> " ' Lo , Miz Billie , " said Hal , the skinny night clerk , and Mama always said , " How are you , Hal ? " as if she really cared . Now restored to something approaching her old high spirits , Mama had everybody at the motel eating out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Mama carried a newspaper . I carried a magazine or a book . ( Once I brought my New Testament , but Mama said , " Honestly , Jenny ! Take that thing back to your room , " rolling her eyes , so I did . ) We 'd settle down ostentatiously on the davenport and begin to read . Behind us stood a row of potted plants . Behind them stood a table with an ashtray and a telephone on it , the only telephone at the Blue Marlin available for guests to use . An old armchair sat next to the table . <p> And every night at exactly nine , here came Tony Curtis through the plate-glass doors . He nodded to Hal and walked straight to the little table , where he sat down and picked up the receiver and asked for a long-distance operator . Mama rattled her paper , reading . Sometimes there 'd be a little wait then , while Tony lit a cigarette or drummed his fingers on the table , until Janet Leigh picked up the phone in Hollywood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hello , darling , " Tony said . <p> Mama sighed . I sighed . We kept on reading . <p> Tony talked about what had happened on the set that day ; he referred to Cary Grant as a fine fellow . Then he 'd ask about the kids , and about the rest of the family , and about their friends . They seemed to have a lot of friends . Sometimes they 'd talk about really boring things , such as money . Janet Leigh always had a lot to say , and Tony chuckled intimately into the phone and smoked another cigarette while he listened . Then he always told her how much he missed her . At this point Mama and I would take deep breaths and straighten up : here came the moment we were waiting for . <p> First Tony said " I love you , " and then listened while ( we guessed ) Janet Leigh said " I love you " back . <p> Then he said , " God bless you , darling , " and hung up . <p> By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her paper , and I felt exactly the way I had in the Bomb Shelter when Harlan Boyd stuck his tongue in my mouth . Mama and I were so rattled that we practically did n't even notice when Tony Curtis strode back through the lobby and out the door . " Thanks , Hal , " he 'd say , giving a mock salute . Tony Curtis was so cute . I even thought old buck-toothed Hal was cute , by this point . I thought everybody was cute . <p> Romance was in the very air here-in the lush , bright flowers , the seductive vines , the lazily twirling overhead fans , the snatches of song on the soft , soft breeze . Surely Mama and Daddy would catch it somehow . Surely they would fall in love again . <p> I had everything riding on this . <p> Then came the big night-when Tony Curtis had just said " God bless you , darling , " and Mama and I were still in a sort of fever state , the night Tony Curtis paused before going out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military way ( his role was that of Navy Lt. Nick Holden ) and walked over to the davenport , right up to Mama and me . He was wearing white shorts and a red knit shirt , I will never forget it . He cleared his throat . " Ladies ? " he said . <p> Mama and I went on reading as though our lives depended on it . <p> " Ladies ? " Tony Curtis said again . <p> I looked up into those famous blue eyes and suddenly had to pee . <p> Mama folded her newspaper and stuck out her hand . " I 'm Billie Dale , from Virginia , " she said , " and this is my daughter Jenny . " <p> Tony Curtis shook Mama 's hand , bowing slightly from the waist , and then took mine . " So pleased to meet you , " he said . He was smiling . " From Virginia , " he repeated . " A beautiful state . " <p> " Yes it is , " Mama said . <p> " Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curtis asked . <p> " Oh , it 's just a vacation , " Mama said . <p> " Actually , my parents are trying to patch up their marriage , " I blurted . All of a sudden I was determined to spill the beans , to tell Tony Curtis the whole thing . He had such a good marriage himself that maybe he could fix up Mama and Daddy 's , give them some good Hollywood advice-a hot tip from the stars . <p> " Jenny , do n't you dare ! " Mama shrieked . <p> Tony Curtis looked very surprised . " Well , " he said , inching back , " I was going to say , if you 've got the time , and if you 're interested , we 'll be shooting crowd scenes for the next two days , and we need extras . Your daughter " - he rolled those big blue eyes at me  --  " might get a kick out of being in the movie . " <p> I threw my book on the floor and started jumping up and down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love to be in the movie ! <p> " Behind the desk , Hal started laughing . <p> " It 's a deal then , " Tony Curtis said to Mama . " You and your husband can be in it too , ma'am , if you want to see what it 's all about . Just show up down at the dock tomorrow morning at nine . We need a big civilian crowd to wave hello to the submarine when it comes into port . " <p> " All right , " Mama said . You could barely hear her . <p> Tony Curtis left for good then , waving to me from the door before he spun militarily on his heel and vanished into the shrubbery . I immediately gathered up his cigarette butts from the ashtray , for my collection . <p> " Maybe you 'll be discovered . " Hal winked at me . <p> " Oh , do n't be silly , " Mama said . " Do n't give her any ideas . " <p> But I already had ideas . Why not ? Jean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been picked from eighteen thousand hopefuls to be Joan of Arc . <p> " Anyway , who knows ? " Mama flung back over her shoulder to Hal . " Maybe I 'll be discovered ! " <p> I ran all the way back to our rooms , Mama following . Daddy sat in the wicker armchair , reading in a yellow pool of light from a Chinese lamp with tassels . The rest of the room was dark . A drink sat sweating on the glass table beside him . Overhead , in the darkness , the fan went around and around , making a whispery noise like wind in the fields back home . <p> " Daddy , Daddy , Daddy ! Guess what ? You 'll never believe it ! We get to be in the movie ! " I stood panting just inside the door . <p> Daddy looked up at me very slowly then , as if he were coming back from somewhere far away , as if I were speaking in a foreign language . In the lamplight his face looked haunted , lined , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their deep sockets . My heart sank . I had caught Daddy out , surprised him . This was the way he really felt , and all the fishing trips and good deeds in the world could never change it . <p> " What is it , Jenny ? " he said . <p> I had to say it , to blunder on . " All of us  --  you and Mama and me-get to be in the movie tomorrow if we go down to the docks . They need extras . Tony Curtis said . " <p> Daddy just looked at me . I realized that the last thing he 'd ever want to do was to be in a movie . He put a little piece of paper in the book to mark his place , and cleared his throat . <p> " Come on , Daddy , please can we do it ? " <p> A little gray smile came and went at the side of Daddy 's mouth . " Well , honey , of course you and your mother can go down there  --  " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from me , and I realized he was speaking now to Mama , who must have come up behind me as he spoke  --  " but I believe I 'll pass on it . " <p> " John- " Mama was still breathless from her climb up the steps . " John , come on , this is the chance of a lifetime . " <p> " Mr. Kinney has sent me some figures I have to look over in the morning . " Daddy 's face was ashen , his long cheek shadowy and hollow . <p> Of course . How could he do it ? How could he ? A man who voted for Adlai Stevenson and loved Carroll Byrd ? A man whose own father had killed himself ? Of course he could n't do it . <p> Behind me , Mama started to cry . I heard her ragged breathing and those snuffly little sounds she always made . Get a grip. ! I wanted to scream at her . Did n't she understand him at all ? Did n't she understand anything ? <p> Daddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , go on to bed , " he said . " It 's late . Go on , so you can be in the movie in the morning . " <p> I spun around , pushing Mama aside . " I hate you ! " I screamed from the balcony . " I hate you both ! " I tore off into the dark and ran all the way to the cemetery , where I threw myself down on somebody 's grave and cried and cried and cried . The concrete was still warm from the sun ; I could feel its heat down the length of my body . It felt strange , good . Finally I rolled onto my back and looked at the starry bowl of the sky . I took a deep breath . There was a full moon coming up , so I could I would never be an angel . I knew that now . Mama was an angel , and Rayette was an angel , but I would never be one , not in a million years , no matter how many good deeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and vowed never to do another one . They had n't worked , anyway . Nothing had worked , and nothing was ever going to work . Mama and Daddy would never patch up their marriage . They would never get back together . <p> I would be an orphan , like Jane Eyre . I would wander alone in the world , doing bad deeds . I would become a stripper . A prostitute . A love slave . Who cared ? Not Jesus , clearly , who had n't done a damn thing for me , in spite of all my efforts . I probably did n't even believe in Him , as a matter of fact . He was too damn picky . Too hard to please . <p> I lay on my back on top of a dead person , thinking this stuff . <p> Bats swooped overhead . A cat stole up to rub against my drooping arm , and I petted it till it purred . The longer I stayed , the brighter the moonlight grew , and the more I could see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I finally got back to the Blue Marlin , where I found Mama and Daddy and Mr. Rudy and a young Cuban policeman all sitting around in #209 waiting for me . They jumped up when I came in . <p> " Oh , thank goodness ! Oh , thank God ! " Mama rushed over to smother me in tears and Chanel No. 5 . <p> Daddy said , " Well , I guess we wo n't be needing your services after all , thank goodness , " and shook hands with the policeman , who left , looking disgusted . Mr. Rudy clicked his tongue disapprovingly at me before he slipped out too . <p> " I 'm sorry , " I started , though I was n't , but Daddy put his finger to my lips . " Hush , Jenny . It 's all right . Just go to bed now , OK ? It 's late . We 'll talk about it in the morning . " <p> But in the morning there was no time to talk . Mama woke me up by shaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come on , get up ! We 're going to be in the movie ! Wake up , honey , you 'll want to wash your hair- " I opened my eyes to find Mama sitting on the edge of my bed looking as lovely as any movie star , hair fixed just so , fire-engine-red lips smiling . She wore a fresh dose of perfume and a full-skirted , red-flowered dress . <p> " You look beautiful , Mama , " I said . <p> " Come on , Jenny , hurry up . " Daddy stood right behind her . He was dressed for the movie too , in a clean white shirt and khaki pants . I did n't ask any questions . I jumped up and took a shower and put on my middy-blouse outfit and some of Mama 's Tabu dusting powder . I parted my hair and combed it carefully , making spit curls over my ears . Then I put on a whole lot of Mama 's makeup , turning the corners of my eyes into silver points like shark fins , like angel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not say a thing about my makeup . <p> They grabbed my hands , and we set off . People poured out of motels and shops and restaurants-tourists , tramps , artists , merchants and shop-girls and women wiping their hands on their aprons . Even the iguana man fell in , with his big lizard circling his shoulders . It was a holiday . " Buenos dias , Jenny , " called Luisa , mincing along in yellow short-shorts and high heels . Sleepy-eyed Rosa waved . Mama 's eyebrows made little arches of surprise . She jerked my hand : " Jenny , who are those girls ? " But I did n't have to answer because somebody started singing : " You had a wife and forty-nine kids but you left , you left , you left , right , left , " and everybody took it up . We became a parade . <p> We trooped down to the navy yard and onto the docks , bursting into a spontaneous cheer at the sight of the pink submarine that steamed back and forth in the harbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen it underway before . Against all that bright-blue water , the pink submarine was miraculous . Mama squeezed my hand . Pelicans and gulls wheeled overhead . Camera crews were everywhere : in the water on a launch , on an official-looking truck at the dock , atop a warehouse . A man with a beard and a bullhorn was lifted high above us on a dolly . <p> " OK ! " his amplified voice rang out . " Ladies and gentlemen ! Boys and girls ! We appreciate your participation here today ! Now , all you have to do is cheer- " at this point we drowned him out . He had to wave his arms to restore order . " Good ! Very good ! All you have to do is cheer-just like that-when the sub comes up to the dock . That 's it ! Got it ? " <p> We cheered again . My throat was getting sore already , and it did n't even count yet . <p> " OK ! Now save it . Do n't do it until I give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wave hello . These guys have been out in the Philippines winning a war for you , so you 're glad to see them , right ? OK ? " <p> I strained to see Tony Curtis on the deck of the submarine , but it was still too far away . The actors looked like ants . The director held his bullhorn up against the sky , then brought it down . Great puffs of white smoke shot out of the smokestacks as the pink sub headed toward shore , toward us , toward home . I started crying and could n't stop . The crowd went wild . I could hear Mama 's high voice , Daddy 's piercing whistle . My makeup was running , but I did n't care . I wiped silvery tears off my chin and kept on crying . It was the happiest moment of my life . We waved and cheered until the pink submarine was at the dock , when Tony Curtis looked straight up at me , I swear he did , and winked . <p> So I did it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West for another week , and every day Daddy softened up a little more , relaxing back into . his old self again . I could see it happening . My parents paid more and more attention to each other , less to me . When Margarita came to their room in the mornings , she had only one bed to make up . I was free to roam all over town by myself , free to get my ears pierced by the oldest of the Cuban children who lived over the grocery-an act that served to unite Mama and Daddy even more , against me : " Honestly , Jenny , nice girls in Virginia do n't have pierced ears ! Only maids have pierced ears , do n't you know anything ? " Mama wailed , clutching Daddy 's hand for support . They would be together for twenty more years . <p> Though this ought to be the end of the story , it 's not . One more thing happened . One more thing is always happening , is n't it ? This is the reason I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can make it all work out to suit you and put The End wherever you please . <p> A few days before we left Key West , Caroline and Tom flew down for a weekend visit , bringing their brand-new baby ( Thomas Kraft Burlington Jr. - then called " Tom-Tom " ) . I could n't wait to see Tom Burlington again , especially now that I had such a nice tan and a new haircut and pierced ears and did not have to be good anymore . I had grown up , I felt . I had been tongue-kissed , and lived among stars . <p> I was ready for him . <p> But when they arrived , Tom would n't pay a bit of attention to me , no more than Mason ever had . All he did was wait on Caroline hand and foot and make goo-goo eyes at his stupid little pointy-headed baby . It made me sick ! Tom-Tom had colic , and he spit up his milk and cried all the time . I was dying to show Tom around Key West ( I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do until Tom-Tom fell asleep , which took forever . But finally the baby lay curled in a tiny red ball , oohed and aahed over by Mama , and Tom stood up . <p> " Come on , honey , " he said to Caroline . " Let 's let Jenny give us this grand tour we 've been hearing so much about . " <p> I held my breath , but Caroline shook her head . " No , honey , you go on . I 'll just catch a few winks , I think . I 'm really exhausted . " <p> Tom looked doubtful , but she squeezed his hand . " Go on , silly , " she said , and he did . <p> I showed him the cemetery first , but he seemed preoccupied , and he did n't even laugh at the funny tombstone that said " I Told You I Was Sick . " Instead he looked sweaty and pale , worried . " I ought to go back , " he said . <p> " No , do n't ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got to come down to the docks for the sunset . I want to show you the sharks and the iguana man . " <p> Tom looked really uncomfortable now . " Maybe tomorrow , " he said , " when Caroline can come too . " <p> We stood there awkwardly among the tombs and angels I loved , while-for the second time in Tom 's presence-I started crying uncontrollably . I do n't know what I had thought-that he would say a poem to me in the graveyard , perhaps , something about love and death , or undying love ... about his undying love for me . Now I knew I was a fool-an idiot . <p> I turned and took off running without another word . <p> " Hey ! " Tom yelled behind me . " Jenny ! Stop ! " <p> But I would n't have stopped for anything . I ran like the wind , straight through the cemetery and out the gate and into the carnival bustle of late afternoon , all the way down Duval Street to the Havana Madrid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stopped short , panting . The door to the bar stood wide open , dark and inviting . I took a deep breath and walked in . <p> It took a while for my eyes to adjust , but then I could see fine . It was plenty light where the sailors sat with their beers , looking up at a girl who walked the long , shiny bar wearing nothing but pasties and a G-string , stopping from time to time to dangle her breasts in their faces . She was a big-legged Cuban girl , nobody I had ever seen before . She reached out and grabbed a sailor 's hat and rubbed it between her legs while he turned bright red . " Gim me that ! " he said . " Give it back ! " No older-looking than Harlan Boyd , he was mortified . Everybody was laughing at him by the time the girl finally smacked the hat back on his head ( yuck ! ) , swayed off down the long bar , and exited . I peered at the girls and men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Rosa and Luisa , but I did n't see them . The unimaginable corners of the cavernous room were dark and vast . <p> " Are you lost , Miss ? " a tall black man asked at my elbow . <p> " I just came in for a drink , " I said , and went over to the bar and climbed onto a stool before he could stop me . Two men sitting to my left elbowed each other , grinning at me . They were old and fat . I grinned back . " Well , hello there , honey , " one of them said . A skinny redhead sashayed down the bar in a top-hat-and-tails outfit , then came back without the tails . <p> I knew exactly what Jesus would think of this place , but since he did n't exist anyway , I ordered a Coke from the flat-chested blond bartender , who was wearing a sort of corset thing . <p> " Make that a rum and Coke for the little lady , " the man beside me said , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took a big drink . The man scooted his stool closer . He touched my knee lightly , with one finger . <p> " Thank you , this is a delicious cocktail , " I said . <p> " It is , huh ! " And suddenly Red is there too , the other bartender , hands on substantial hips , fiery Medusa hair standing out all around her head , bosom heaving furiously . " Jenny , you get your ass out of here right now ! " she yells , and I run right out the door , right into Tom Burlington . He grabs my shoulders and shakes me until my teeth rattle , then hugs me , then shakes me again . <p> " You little bitch ! " he says . <p> What a relief ! I have been recognized at last . I am a little bitch , and I will never be an angel , and it 's OK . I start laughing , and Tom starts laughing too . <p> This is the moment when the street photographer snapped our picture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me , and I have it still . I blew it up . I tend to move around a lot , but I always take this picture with me . I keep it right here on my desk . <p> In the picture , Tom Burlington and I cling together in the jostling crowd , our arms wound tightly around each other . We look like lovers . Behind us is the Havana Madrid sign with the winking lady 's face on it . There is something she knows that I do n't know yet . But I will learn . And I will get my period , and some breasts . I will also do it plenty , thereby falling into numerous messy situations too awful to mention here . I will never be really good again . I am not good . I am as ornery and difficult and inconsolable as Carroll Byrd . <p> I do n't know whatever happened to her , or to Tom Burlington , who left my sister suddenly for another woman , an English teacher at his school , when Tom-Tom was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lawyer in Charleston , where she has raised four children and is head of the Historical Society . Our lives are very different , Caroline 's and mine , and I regret that I do n't see much of her now , except for her children 's graduations and weddings . Beth is still married and living out West ; I do n't see much of her either . Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh are long divorced . He 's an artist now . Cary Grant is dead . Grandmother and Aunt Chloe and Aunt Judy are dead . Mama is dead too , of ovarian cancer in 1979 . After she died , Daddy turned the mill into a co-op and gave it to his employees ; Mr. Kinney 's son is running it today . Then Daddy surprised everybody by moving to Boca Raton , Florida , where he " up and married " ( as Mama would have said ) the real estate woman who sold him his condo . This woman has a black , spiky hairdo , and everybody calls her " the Shark . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his current personality bears no relation that I can see to his former self , to the person in this story . Cousin Glenda ran a rest home for many years following Raymond 's death ; now she is in the rest home , and Rayette and her husband are running it . Rayette sends me a long , chatty Christmas letter every year , even though I never did get a grip . I do n't know what happened to Harlan Boyd . Jinx is still my friend , and we keep in touch by phone and meet at a spa in Sedona once a year . <p> For some reason I ca n't quit writing this story , or looking at this picture , in which the sun is so bright , and Tom Burlington and I are smiling like crazy . I guess it reminds me of Mama and Daddy in love , of the day when Mama and Daddy and I walked down to the docks to be in the movie , and cheered when the pink submarine came in , and waved hello . <p> <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
