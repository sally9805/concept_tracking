<p> In May 1994 , Robert Burkhart , a Child Care Program Specialist in the Seattle , Washington Regional Office of the Administration for Children and Families , U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , traveled to China with a delegation of 49 representatives from 26 states . The delegation 's objective was to study child care and child education issues in China . Delegation members spent two weeks visiting the cities of Beijing , Nanjing , Suzhao , Wujiang and Shanghai , touring 10 child care centers , and meeting with university and government officials and center directors and teachers in each location . The following is the author 's personalized account of the trip . <p> When members of our delegation jokingly confessed to our Chinese hosts , " In kindergarten we had the saying that if we dug deep enough in the sand , we would come out on the other side of the world in China , " they smiled and replied , " And our children have the same saying that if they dig deep enough in the sand , they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one example of the many commonalities we experienced while visiting child care institutions in China . <p> Sponsored by the People to People Ambassadors for Peace program , 50 U.S. child care professionals and guests left San Francisco on May 15 , 1994 aboard a China Airlines jet bound for Beijing , China . Our guide was Professor Michael Kalinowski from the University of New Hampshire 's Child Study &; Development Center . Dr. Kalinowski had been a participant in an earlier U.S. China Joint Conference on Early Childhood Education . He had been invited to return with a delegation study team focused on cultural interchanges concerning child care . <p> The delegation members were professionals involved in the field of early childhood education as either day care center directors or university instructors . Like me , a few of the delegation representatives were involved in the government regulation and policy formulation aspects of child care . All of us were excited about learning how child care was working in this most populous country just emerging from years of strict state control . <p> What follows are some common themes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and entered into discussions with child care directors and teachers . Child Care Expansion <p> In China , the growth of child care outside the home has occurred primarily since 1949 , when 130,000 children were enrolled in government sponsored child care programs . Today , as reported by Professor Zhao Ji Shi of Nanjing University , nearly 25 million children ( ages birth to 6 ) are enrolled in center based care . <p> " Kindergarten " is a term the Chinese use to refer to any out-of-home care for children up to age six or seven . Children usually enter care at age two but may start care as early as 6 months of age . In a few kindergartens that board children in 24-hour care , the children return home only on weekends . Reform <p> Staff at the centers , which are moving in the direction of local control and flexibility , were constantly using the word " reform . " Their questions to us primarily concerned how the United States handles diversity and promotes individual creativity in children . While the government in China establishes standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curriculum development in that country are reportedly subject to much more local control . Only Child Policy <p> Most children we observed in the centers we visited were only children  --  that is , parents had limited their family to one child in accordance with China 's population control goals . Numerous studies in progress reveal that only children are not significantly different from children in multiple child families . Of course , even only children are raised more communally in China , and are frequently enrolled in day care at a very early age . Trip Highlights <p> For many of us , the highlight of the trip was having the opportunity to meet with and hear a speech delivered by Professor Zhao Ji Shi of Nanjing Normal University . Known as the " matriarch " of child care in modern China , Professor Zhao Ji Shi is a diminutive , delightful woman who spoke flawless English as she related the history of child care in China since 1949 . This was the year that China inaugurated a modern campaign to establish preschool care and education . <p> It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " liberate mothers and fathers " by providing both care and education for children from birth through age 6 or 7 and making education accessible for workers and peasants . Kindergartens were established all over the country , along with three year teacher training programs for young women who had completed at least grade 9 of compulsory education . <p> In 1971 , in an effort to control their expanding population , the State instituted its successful " one child " policy . Following China 's participation in The World Summit for Children in the early 1990s , the State issued an ambitious 10-year plan designed to enhance the care and protection of children . <p> The plan seeks to : TABLE <p> One of the most influential advocates for care of children and progressive policies in kindergartens has been the All China Women 's Federation . Professor Ji Shi and others frequently referred to the Women 's Federation when discussing the many policy reforms that began to take place in the late 1980s and early 1990s . <p> Because child care in China is undergoing such rapid change and modernization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of current practices . However , when compared with the broad diversity in the United States occurring state by state and city by city , the Chinese system seems much more uniform . The following are brief descriptions of child care components that I heard during the tour . Funding <p> Child Care is predominately funded by the State and State controlled businesses and factories . Parents pay only a token amount toward the care of their child . Generally , child care rates are low , as are typical wages . A factory worker , for example , might make only $130 per month plus perks such as housing and child care . Staff Training <p> All kindergarten teachers are required to graduate from a three-year training course and take annual refresher courses . A teacher must have 240 hours of refresher courses every 5 years . Even so , both the pay and status for teachers is low . At the model centers visited , the teachers observed seemed highly qualified and competent . Although the teachers at these centers ( like their counterparts in the United States ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their opportunity for upward mobility is limited . Enrollment <p> There are 17,200 kindergartens in China . About 27 percent of all children under age six are enrolled in kindergarten . Boys and girls are about evenly represented in classes . While about 70 percent of eligible children in cities are enrolled , the percentage of children enrolled in the country is much lower . By the year 2000 , China hopes that 100 percent of the country 's children will have at least one year of kindergarten before elementary school . It was difficult to obtain any reliable information on waiting lists . Child-Staff Ratio <p> Most classes are mandated to hold from 30 to 35 children . Each class has a head teacher and an assistant . With smaller children , the class may have more than one assistant . We were advised that in rural areas class size can increase to 50 or more . Health and Immunization <p> All vaccines are free to children up to age seven . Most kindergartens have a nurse on duty to administer vaccinations and a daily health check . Large centers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trend away from breast feeding and is encouraging its return . The most common malady of children is iron deficiency . Children drink soy bean juice instead of milk . Herbal medicine is emphasized . Parent Involvement <p> Because most parents work , direct parent involvement in the classroom is minimal . Each kindergarten conducts parent meetings to provide feedback to parents on their children 's progress . Parents are also offered advice and training on good parenting . Politicization <p> Evidently in the past , strong emphasis was placed on teaching State values to children . This seems to be changing under China 's reform policies . Kindergartens do stress obedience to the teacher , societal values , and group over individual priorities . The children our delegation observed were very responsive to teacher directives in large group settings . Materials and Equipment <p> In the model programs we visited , staff were innovative with minimal materials and equipment . Most classrooms were well lighted and ventilated and clean . Rooms were decorated colorfully with developmentally appropriate art work . While playground equipment was not necessarily new , staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most programs operate old-fashioned , box-like pump organs for their music . Regulation and Monitoring <p> All facilities are " licensed " as first , second , or third class sites . Teachers are paid more in first class sites and fees may also be higher . Monitoring seems to be done through provinces or city structures . <p> In 1989 , the State Education Commission published a working document called Kindergarten Management Regulations , which is used to monitor practice and standards . In 32 " articles , " this document spells out a philosophy and specific standards and practice goals for kindergartens . Article 21 , for example , says , " The daily programme of a kindergarten should be organized in such a way that mobile and static activities should be alternating . The practice of children should be stressed so as to ensure that children could have all kinds of pleasant , useful , free activities . " Private Kindergartens <p> A recent phenomenon in China is the development of private kindergartens established by young businessmen and women under reform policies permitting private enterprise . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitored . China 's Children 's Day <p> Each year on the first of June , China celebrates International Children 's Day as a way to value children . This event offers programs that feature singing and dancing , free admission to parks and entertainment centers , and parties and activities in all the kindergartens and schools . The day culminates in a " Hand to Hand " project where children in more affluent cities donate books and supplies to children in rural areas . Other Impressions <p> China seems to be moving forward in another great economic leap . Building and construction is in progress everywhere . The contrast between the old and the new is striking . Modern earth movers work alongside hundreds of men with picks and shovels ; multitudes bicycle to work alongside modem company owned Mercedes cars ; wooden buckets are lowered into water wells alongside sparkling new skyscrapers ; and enterprising dentists set up early morning card table clinics on the sidewalk to examine teeth and earn extra money before beginning their regular day under the State system . Biggest Surprise <p> As we prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our China guide told us that the teachers might expect us to stage a brief program , and that the teachers would be doing the same for us . We decided that without any real practice , we could always sing the familiar children 's song that begins , " If you are happy and you know it , clap your hands . . . " Since we were foreigners traveling in a distant land , we thought we could also probably sing a verse or two of " Moon River . " <p> Because there was no mention of our " program " when we met with the teachers that day , we breathed a sigh of relief and thought we were off the hook . After an evening banquet , we were taken into a Karaoke Bar , served coffee , and had some fun exchanging a few " solo 's . " Then our guide abruptly announced that it was time to leave . But instead of heading for our bus , our group walked through the streets of the crowded town until we were ushered into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were seated near the front of an auditorium filled with about 5,000 people and handed programs ( all in Chinese ) that indicated , according to our guide , that we were number 6 on the program . After seeing the professional caliber of the first few numbers that featured Chinese opera and professional dance troupes , we were ready to sink down in our seats or head for the nearest exit . <p> But there was no escape . When our turn came , we all trooped on stage and bravely sang , clapped , and stomped our way through the children 's song . The audience was gracious , and before the song was over , they were clapping and waving with us . Many in the audience also seemed to know the song " Moon River " and sang it along with us . The experience turned out to be a delightful demonstration of the humor and cordiality of our Chinese hosts . <p> Many from our group hope to have a reunion at the November NAEYC conference in Atlanta . Perhaps they will be persuaded to perform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You bet ! This trip offered the chance of a lifetime to explore and compare the achievements and methods of China and the United States in the area of child care and early childhood education . Our delegation tour highlighted the societal and family norms that are so different yet so similar in these two culturally disparate countries . Most of all , this experience dramatically brought home to me that the hopes of both China and the United States lie in their children 's future . <p> PHOTO : Opposite Top : Professor Zhao Ji Shi of Nanjing University with author , Robert Burkhart .
