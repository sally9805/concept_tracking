How to find the right summer program for your child Happy Campers You 're nine years old . It 's night - time . You 're in the middle of a forest , miles from home . Strange noises are coming at you from all sides . You could be feeling lost and shedding huge , homesick tears right now  --  but you 're not . You 're sitting around a crackling campfire with a dozen other kids your age , singing silly songs and laughing your head off , a brand - new best friend by your side . Summer camp is a tradition in our country . Since the turn of the century , millions of Canadian kids have headed off for treasured days or weeks in the great outdoors . In 1995 some 400,000 youngsters attended Canadian Camping Association ( CCA ) camps . They chose from nearly 600 member facilities  --  200 in Ontario alone . Glenda MacKay , mother of Matthew , 11 , and Sarah , eight , has fond memories of her days at Camp Monahan in Saskatchewan 's Qu'Appelle Valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Regina mom , " but it 's the campfire that stands out . I remember sitting around it , and the songs , and doing skits with my group . It was a real feeling of togetherness and friendship . " So last summer when MacKay and her husband , Kevin , started looking for a camp for Matthew , they had a head start . Encouraged by advertisements in their church bulletin and the advice of fellow parishioners , Glenda quickly put her childhood camp on their shortlist . The final decision was n't hard for Matthew . " I wanted to go where my mom went , " he says . The familiarity provided comfort both to Matthew , who was a little nervous about being away from home , and his parents , who wanted a camp they knew would be safe and fun . But for many families , the choice is n't so obvious . Summer camps , whether day camps or residential , cater to preschoolers through to teens and offer activities as traditional as swimming and crafts or as unlikely as cheerleading and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " p. 60 ) . They feature facilities that range from rustic to deluxe , sessions that last from a few short days to several weeks , and weekly fees that go from free up to $800 or more . With all these possibilities , the task of deciding where to send your child to summer camp can be a little overwhelming . But it does n't have to be . First , decide if you 're looking for a day camp or a residential ( a.k.a. sleepover ) camp . While they provide similar experiences  --  an opportunity for children to have some fun while spending time away from family , learning different skills and meeting new people  --  there is , of course , a major difference : Day campers go home at the end of the day while residential campers sleep at camps , usually located outside of urban centres . The Sasamat Outdoor Centre in Belcarra , B.C. runs both day and residential programs . Operated by the Association of Neighbourhood Houses of Greater Vancouver , day camp at this facility means children aged six and older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Dave Stevens , the centre 's director and past president of the B.C. Camping Association , points out that the term " day camp " can describe a few different types of programs . For example , many day camps run by service agencies or educational institutions offer " summer fun programs , " which Stevens describes as " a kaleidoscope of recreational experiences . " Kids sign up for a session and meet at a community centre , then head out to a different site every day  --  water slides , museums and so on . Deborah Kirby of Bowen Island , B.C. , enrolled her six - year - old daughter in just such a program . " I wanted Eleanor to have something a little different to do that was fun , " says Kirby . " I also saw it as a warm - up for school , a chance for her to get used to a routine . " Kirby found in day camp the enrichment program she was looking for . " At camp your children learn things you do n't think to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own , how to participate without you  --  that they can . It was wonderful . " Some camps will take children as young as three for day programs but the lower age limit at Sasamat is around six . If a child is on the borderline , the centre is flexible . " We tell parents it 's their decision , " Stevens says . " But we ask if the child has been in preschool or kindergarten and how that went . If it was a traumatic experience every day , the child 's not ready . " The MacKays enrolled Sarah in a day program run by Regina 's YMCA last summer . " We just felt she was n't quite old enough for a camp away from home , " says Kevin . The Regina Y 's program offered a choice of focuses  --  either sports and computers or arts and crafts  --  as well as outdoor activities like swimming . Its nine - to - five , five - day - a - week schedule suited the family 's needs well , as both parents work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wendover , Ontario , do n't take children younger than nine at The Horse People , their residential horseback - riding camp . " We just do n't feel they 're ready before that , " explains Bev , who holds a master 's degree in child psychology . The exact age at which kids will feel ready for the away - from - home camp experience will vary , she notes . But campers will be on their way when they can accept both the separation from parents and the responsibility of taking care of themselves with less supervision than they might be used to at home . And what will they be ready for ? " The opportunity to develop a sense of independence , " says Schinke . " Making your own bed , making sure that your laundry gets into the laundry bag , getting yourself to meals on time , making friends on your own without teachers or parents running interference for you . " Once you 've decided on a day or residential camp , the next step is to sit down with your camper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big or a small camp ? What 's really of interest to him  --  water sports ? Ceramics ? Computer skills ? How much of his summer does he want to spend at camp ? There 's no point in sending your child to the camp of your dreams if it does n't suit his own interests and personality . One of the best ways to find out about possibilities is to ask friends , relatives and colleagues for recommendations . Or try your provincial camping association  --  most publish camping guides which include a list of accredited members and a handful of details about each . Camp fairs , if available in your province , are great places to investigate leads , offering parents and kids a chance to view videos , pick up descriptive literature and talk to staff . If you 're familiar with the ways of the World Wide Web , you can visit the CCA 's straightforward home page ( see Resources , p. 60 ) or the Web sites of individual camps , which might offer detailed information and photos . Stevens notes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't list them in the provincial guide , so make sure you ask . And do n't overlook the Yellow Pages , local newspapers and magazines , community centres and schools . Once you 've compiled your camp shortlist , it 's time to look at your finalists under a microscope . As Glenda MacKay says , " If you 're going to be home worrying about your kids , it 's not worth it . So you have to do whatever it takes to put your mind at ease . If itmeans doing hours of research and meeting people , that 's it . " According to Margaret Seel , president of the CCA , one of the most common parental concerns  --  quite rightly  --  is staffing . The location can be stunning , she points out , but if the staff members are n't tuned in to the kids ' needs and interests , if they have n't developed good programs , if they are n't providing a safe , fun environment , the lovely lake does n't mean a thing . Expect directors to have degrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Look for senior staff with maturity and a demonstrated interest in kids . Some may even be students preparing for careers involving children , or former campers who liked the place so much , they 've come back for more . In fact , you should ask lots of questions : What is the camp 's philosophy and focus ? ( " Make sure the philosophy is more than just a slogan on the wall , " urges Schinke . ) What does the staff do about homesickness ? About discipline ? How does the camp hire and train staff ? How many returning campers and staff do they have ? If it 's possible to take your research one step further by actually visiting the camp , grab the opportunity . Many camps have open houses during the off - season , when potential campers and their parents can view the site , have a first - hand look at the facilities and talk to the director . If you ca n't manage to visit in person , a phone call is the next best thing ( or e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The more questions and answers that are exchanged , the better . " If everyone 's prepared , " says Schinke , " it makes it easier to come into the camp situation . " Perhaps most valuable is the voice of experience . Schinke and Seel both advise parents to talk to others whose kids have attended the camp they 're looking at . " The best referral comes from word of mouth . Are the kids coming back ? Are they bringing their friends ? Are they having fun ? " asks Schinke . Finally , do n't leave your camp shopping until the last minute . Ideally , you should start gathering information in March and plan to register in April or May . Day camps may be more flexible  --  some do n't take applications until May or June , but some will fill up earlier . You might also want to ask about early sign - up deadlines , which might offer discounts to extra - prompt parents . If you 're getting a late start , however , do n't despair . Many camps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to get your first choice . Did the MacKays choose right for Matthew and Sarah ? They think so . " It was fun , " says Sarah . " I 'd go back . " And Matthew ? He 's now preparing for this summer 's two - week Scout jamboree camp in Ontario and contemplates a return to Monahan next year as a counsellor - in - training . " Matthew was so enthusiastic when he came home , " his mom recalls . " He was full of information  --  talking , talking , talking  --  he wanted to share everything . He learned so much  --  skills like canoeing and setting up camp . Independence . Confidence . It was very exciting .
