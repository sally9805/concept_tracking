<p> No one 's in charge . There is no structure , no agenda , no planned content . <p> Posted on the wall are two hand-drawn signs . One reads simply , " The Law of Two Feet , " and shows a crude rendition of two footprints . The other lists four principles that clarify nothing : " Whoever comes is the right people " ; " Whatever happens is the only thing that could have " ; " Whenever it starts is the right time " ; and " When it 's over it 's over . " <p> Whether or not what happened in Ballroom C at the Sheraton Crystal City one morning two weeks ago was the only thing that could have happened is debatable . That it was the strangest conference 50 senior administrators of the U.S. Forest Service have ever attended , no one is debating . <p> " The most puckered , tight , hierarchy in Washington " is how one of the Forest Service participants described the gathered bureaucrats as they mulled about , sipping coffee , rechecking watches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They seated themselves in folding chairs arranged in a large circle . With their arms crossing their chests in classic defensive posture , they looked at the ceiling , looked at each other . All they knew was they were scheduled to be there all day . <p> " You never know what 's going to happen , " Harrison Owen says as an aside before he steps to the center of the circled administrators to get things started . Unlike most experts in organizational behavior , Owen thrives on ambiguity and believes that , in the right circumstances , workplaces do too . His theories fly in the face of business as usual . While others try to boost productivity by reorganizing and controlling , he dabbles in chaos , promoting it as a potent creative force . Others focus on the nitty-gritty of organization ; he tunes in to the spirit . <p> Calling his work " organizational transformation , " Owen has applied his innovations at major corporations on five continents , as well as with small tribal villages in West Africa , personnel managers in India , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , skepticism always greets his offbeat approach . He expected nothing less from the forestry managers toward the largely leaderless and formless meeting he calls Open Space Technology . <p> " Every single group I have ever worked with has told me upfront it 's a great idea but it will never work with them , " says Owen , president of H.H. Owen and Co. , his consulting firm in Potomac . " Groups that I think I could never get them to do it , like the senior executives for Pepsi-Cola in Venezuela , they take to it like ducks to water . " <p> Were it not for the savvy corporate execs and hard-core senior managers who attest to the effectiveness of Open Space Technology , it might seem like Harrison Owen has hit upon a fat scam in a business world grasping desperately for new solutions . By his own estimate , he spends only about five minutes preparing for these one- to five-day conferences . His corporate rate runs about $ 2,000 a day ( though he donated his services to the African village and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets a group moving in the right direction , he " goes and sits down the hall . " For the Open Space experience to work , he says , no one can take charge  --  including himself . <p> " That 's the big secret , " says Owen , whose credentials include Anglican priest and author of several management books . " I do n't do anything . There 's nothing to plan  --  just when is it going to be , and where , and who 's coming . My major job is to get them to stop doing things . I have to tell them ' Do n't worry , it 's going to happen . ' " <p> What does happen is n't predictable , nor is it easily defined . In a sense , Open Space Technology is kind of the brainstorming version of the classic " Stone Soup " story : Owen 's minimal guidance is like the rock in a pot of boiling water , everyone else contributes their ideas to the soup , and in the end the group is well-fed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Owen , referring to the highly interpretable ink-blot psychology test that is impossible to fail so long as one participates . " The structure that will emerge , will emerge as a response . My goal is that within an hour , we will have the whole agenda for the entire conference and the people to carry it out . " <p> For the first 15 minutes , the Forest Service managers listen soberly to Owen 's briefing . He assures them Open Space Technology has worked before , often , and sometimes brilliantly . There was the time the National Education Association brought 420 teachers , school board members and administrators to Colorado to explore how to enhance education in America ; in less than an hour they created 85 workshops and then ran the two-day conference themselves . <p> Last fall , the Forest Service 's own travel-and-management division hosted 224 people representing 65 organizations  --  from the Sierra Club to timber companies to the National Nude Sunbathing Society  --  to meet on the issue of access to public land . In less than an hour , they created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . " About the only thing they had in common was the issue at hand and their antagonism for each other , " says Owen . " But by the end of the second day , we had available a 200-page report of their findings . The only complaint was that the report was too detailed to assimilate . " <p> If Owen has reinvented the meeting , he 's done it by recognizing that creativity abhors a vacuum . His instructions to the forestry managers are brief : Each is to think of an area or issue he or she is passionate about that relates to the conference 's theme ( " Enhancing Relationships With Our Customers " ) ; then title it , be prepared to take responsibility for it , step forward and write the title on a piece of poster paper , and tack it to the wall . <p> The room buzzes with doubt and excitement . " Think of something which is important to you , " encourages Owen . " And if nothing pops up , do n't worry about it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue and starts marking it on poster paper . Two more stand up , followed by a flurry of others . Squeaking felt-tip markers compete with voices announcing topics : " Consumption and Recycling , " " Whistleblowers : How Can We Be Known Again as an Honest Agency ? " and " Multiculturalism . " <p> As sudden as it started , it stops . Buying time for late-blooming ideas , Owen " orchestrates the flow " of what will occur for the rest of the day : The posted topics are arranged in immediate , late morning , and afternoon time slots and are designated locations . Anyone interested in an issue signs up and shows up . Those who originate the issue take notes of what goes on . <p> Thirty-two minutes into the conference , the forestry managers have created and scheduled 13 workshops . Owen sends them off , telling them only to report back later that afternoon . <p> " People say how do you get substantive results out of that ? " Owen says afterward . " But the same people who would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of a sudden find themselves operating with absolutely no problems in a situation where leadership is constantly changing and structure is made and remade to fit the task at hand . Suddenly the barriers go down . " <p> Owen 's credo is " Structure Happens . " As he told the Forest Service managers , " What we 're really talking about is inspired performance . Can you force inspired performance ? You can evoke it . You can give space for it . You can train for it . You can hope for it . You can pray for it . But can you force it ? No . " <p> Looking over the workshop choices , Paige Ballard says he 's never been to a meeting like this . " It sure seems to encourage creativity and free thought , " says the Forest Service 's recycling program manager . " It is n't inhibiting about what we can talk about and who can talk about it . And everybody gravitates to what they 're comfortable with . Different strokes for different folks . " <p> Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvement who has contracted with Owen for several such conferences with other Forest Service departments , believes Open Space works especially well for the silent majority  --  most of the people in a bureaucracy who usually say the least . " It 's not for every meeting , " he says , " but it is certainly a way to get participative juices flowing . " <p> Owen designed Open Space Technology seven years ago after a meeting with a group of organizational experts in Monterey , Calif . At the end , everyone confessed they got more out of the coffee breaks than the meeting itself . " So my question was , ' Is there a way of producing the kind of good , intense interaction you get in a coffee break while achieving the output and performance you get in a meeting ? ' " he says . <p> " I was looking for a mechanism that was so simple that you could do it in a boardroom or in a Third-World village with the same results . When all is said and done , people really have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  which is the reason the level of spirit and creativity are so high . " <p> Last spring , in South Africa , Owen conducted a one-day Open Space meeting that included the mayor of Cape Town and several black leaders . " I 'll never forget . We were all standing in this circle at the end and everybody was holding hands crying , " says Owen . " They were saying that they were the new South Africa and there was a lot of work to do . <p> " Open Space seems to create an incredible sense of community . The key is , it 's a safe space within which people can take authority and responsibility for themselves . "
