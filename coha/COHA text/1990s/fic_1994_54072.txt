Greg sent us " Doing Alien " as a not-so-serious companion piece to his recent column on the possibility of intelligent life in outer space . <p> I REMEMBER HOW MITCHELL was putting the moves on some major league pussy when the news about the aliens came in . <p> That Mitchell , he stopped in mid-line and cocked his big square head and said kind of whispery , " Double dog damn . " Then he went back to the little redhead he had settled onto the stool next to his , way down at the end of the mahogany bar at Nan 's . <p> But I could tell he was distracted . He 's the kind of fella always drawn to a touch of weirdness . At Mardi Gras he just loved the confusion , not being able to tell guys from gals , or who was what , the whole thing . <p> He left with the redhead before ten , which was pretty quick even for Mitchell . When he 's headed for the sheets there is n't much can get in Mitchell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alphas on the TV . Going out , he gave me the old salute and big smile but I could tell he was thinking off somewhere , not keeping his mind and his hands on the redhead . Which was n't like him . <p> Mitchell 's been my buddy since the earth 's crust cooled off . I can read him pretty well . We graduated high school about the time the dinosaurs started up and went into farm equipment sales together when there were still a few nickels to make in that game . I 've seen Mitchell bareass in the woods howling around a campfire , watched him pulling in six-foot tuna off the back of McKenzie 's old boat , laughed when he was drunk up to his eyeballs with a big brassy broad on each arm and a shit ass happy grin . For sure I know him better than any of his goddamn two ex-wives or his three kids . None of them 'd recognize him on the street , pretty near . <p> So when the Alphas showed up right here in Fairhope I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These Alphas come in slick as you please , special escort in limos and all . They go down to the wharf and look at the big new Civic Center and all , but nobody has a dime 's worth of idea what they 're here for . <p> Neither does the escort . Two suits on every Alpha , dark glasses and shoulder-slung pistols and earplug radios and the like . You could see it plain , the way their tight mouths twitched . They du n no from sour owl shit what to expect next . <p> For sure nobody thought they 'd go into Nan 's . Just clank on in , look around , babble that babble to each other , plunk down on those chrome stools . <p> Then they order up . Mitchell and me , we was at the other end of the bar . The Alphas , they are ordering up and putting them down pretty quick . Nobody knows their chemistry but they must like something in gimlets and fireballs and twofers , cause they sure squirt them in quick . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suits stand stiff as boards , but the locals ooze around them , curious . The Alphas do n't pay any attention . Maybe they 're used to it or maybe they do n't even know people are there unless they need something . Way they act , you could believe that . <p> But Mitchell , he keeps eyeing them . Tries to talk to them . They do n't pay him no never mind . Buys one a drink , even , but the Alpha wo n't touch it . <p> I could see it got to him . Not the first day maybe or the second . By the third , though , he was acting funny . Studying them . The Alphas would show up at Nan 's , suck in plenty of the sauce , then blow out of town in those limos . <p> News people around , crowds waiting to see them , the whole goddamn shooting match . Made Fairhope hell to get around in . I was gone three days to Birmingham on a commission job with International Harvester , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come into town all busted out from chasing tail in Birmingham and first thing you know , phone rings and Mitchell wants help . <p> " I 'm in that beat up shack back of Leroy 's TV , " he said . <p> " That place 's no biggem a coffin and smells worse . " <p> " They spruced it up since Briggs run that poker game in here . " <p> " So who you pokin there now ? " <p> " Fred , your dick fell off your I.Q. would be zero . " <p> " That happen , what 'd I need to think for ? " <p> " Get your dumb ass over here . " <p> So I did . Walk in on Mitchell in a chair , this brunette working on him . First I figured she was from over Bessie 's , giving him a manicure with her kit all spread out . Turns out she 's a makeup gal from clear over to New Orleans . Works Mardi Gras and like that . <p> Only she 's not making Mitchell up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is serious . She 's painting shellack all over him . He 's already got a crust on him like dried mud in a hog wallow , only it 's orange . <p> " Christ on a crutch , " is all I can say . <p> " Mix me a bourbon and branch . " Mitchell 's voice came out muffled by all these pink pancake-size wattles on his throat , like some kind of rooster . <p> So I do . Only he does n't like it , so he gets up and makes his own . " Got to add a twist sometimes , " he says . <p> Mitchell was always picky about drinks . He used to make coffee for the boys , morning after a big carouse , and it had to be Colombian and ground just so and done up in this tricky filter rig he made himself out of tin sheeting . <p> That 's how he was with this makeup girl , too . She layered on ridges of swarthy gum all down his arms , then shaped it with little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mitchell was too under all the makeup . <p> I 'm wondering what the hell , and Mitchell says , " Go take a squint , see if they 're in Nan 's yet . " <p> So I 'm catching on . Mitchell 's always had something working on the side , see , but he takes his time about letting on . Kind of subtle , too . When Mr. Tang moved into Fairhope with his factory , Mitchell was real respectful and polite and called him Poon for a year before that Tang caught on . <p> As I go out the shack and down the alley I see why he used that place . I angle across Simpson 's parking lot and down by those big air conditioners and pop out on Ivy right next to Nan 's . That way , none of the suits can see you coming . Slip in the side door and sure as God 's got a beard , there 's three Alphas . Got a crowd around them but the room is dead quiet . People just looking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that plenty of fastlane operators were trying to get information out of Alphas , seeing as they got all this technology . We did n't even see them coming , that 's how good their stuff is . <p> First thing anybody knew , they were bellying up to Venus , this other planet out there . Covered in clouds , it was . Then the Alphas start to work on her . First thing you know , you can see those volcanoes and valleys . <p> Anybody who can clear up muggy air like that inside a week , you got to pay attention . Turned out that was just cleaning off the work bench . Next they spun a kind of magnetic rod , rammed it in at the pole , clean down into the core of the whole damn planet . Easy as sticking an ice pick through an apple . Only the ice pick was hollow and they sucked the liquid metal out of there . Up the rod like it was a straw , and out into space . To make those metal city kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people started getting really afraid . And some others got really interested . The way they figured , any little scrappy thing you got from an Alpha might just be a billion-buck trick . <p> That 's the scoop I heard on CNN coming down from Birmingham , anyway . Now here was the whole circus in Fairhope , big as life and twice as ugly . Snoops with those directional microphones . Cameras in the backs of vans , shooting out through dark windows . Guys in three-piece suits kind of casual slouched against the bar and trying to get an Alpha to notice them . <p> So back I go . Mitchell is getting some inflated bags stuck on him by the makeup girl . Bags all over his back and chest and neck even . He 's all the Alpha colors now , from Georgia clay red here to sky blue there . <p> " Three of ' em sucking it up in there , " I said . <p> " Holy shit , let 's go , " Mitchell croaks back at me . The girl had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound like a frog at the bottom of a rain barrel . <p> The girl pats him all over with that fine , rusty dust the Alphas are always shedding . She straightens the pouches so you can hardly see that his arms are too short for an Alpha . <p> " Let 's make tracks , " Mitchell says , and proceeds to do just that . Alpha tracks , fat and seven-toed . <p> We go across the parking lot , so the escorts ca n't see . In a minute we 're in Nan 's . The other Alphas do n't take any notice of Mitchell but all the people do . They move out of the way fast and we parade in , me a little behind so it 'll seem like I was just a tourist . Mitchell 's got the Alpha shuffle down just right , to my eye . <p> Bold as brass , he sits down . The suits look at each other , du n no what to do . But they buy it , that Mitchell 's one of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asks and Mitchell orders , making a kind of slithery noise . <p> He slurps down two drinks before anything happens . An Alpha makes a gesture with that nose thing of theirs and Mitchell does too . Then there 's some more gesturing and they talk like wet things moving inside a bag . <p> I sit and listen but I ca n't make sense out of any of it . Mitchell seems to know what he 's doing . He keeps it up for maybe five more minutes . I can see it 's wearing on him . He gives me the signal . <p> I clear some space for him so he can get back up  --  that crap he was wearing weighs real considerable . He gets up smooth and shuffles some and then we 're out the door . Free and clean . We got back to the shack before we let go with the whooping and hollering . <p> We pull it off four more times in the next three weeks . Each time the Alphas take more notice of Mitchell . Hard to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from New Orleans and does him up , getting better each time . I keep an ear open for word on the street and it 's all good . <p> Or seems so to me , anyway . Everybody thinks Mitchell 's the real thing . Course that 's people talking , not Alphas . After the fourth time I could n't hold back any more . " You got some money angle on this , right ? " <p> " Money ? " <p> " What I want to know is , how you going to get anything out of them ? " <p> " I 'm not in for money . " <p> " You figure maybe you can get one of those little tool kits they carry ? They do n't look hooked on real firm or anything . " <p> Mitchell grinned . " Would n't try that , I was you . Fella in Cincinnati went to lift one , came up an arm short . " <p> " Then what the hell you in for ? " <p> Mitchell gave me this funny look . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So goddamn what ? " <p> " You do n't get it , Fred . Thing about aliens is , they 're alien . " In his eyes there 's this look . Like he was seeing something different , something important , something way bigger than Fairhope . <p> I could n't make any more sense out of what he said after that . That 's when I realized . Mitchell just wanted to be close to them , was all . <p> That pretty well took the wind out of my sails . I 'd figured Mitchell was onto something for sure . I went with him one more time , that 's all . And a few days later I heard that the same Alpha was coming back to Nan 's every day , just sitting and waiting for more Alphas to come in , and hanging out with them when they did . <p> It went that way for a while and I was feeling pretty sour about it . I went on a carouse with the Perlotti brothers and had me a pretty fair time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head that barely fit in the room and in walks Mitchell . " Heard you maybe needed some revivin ' from last night . " <p> He was grinning and I was glad to see him even if he did waste a slab of my time . We 'd do little things like that for each other sometimes , bring a fells a drink or a hundred dollar bill when he was down and could sure use it . So I crawled up out of bed and pulled on some jeans and went into the kitchen . <p> Mitchell was filling a pot and popping open one of his Colombian coffee packs . I got some cups and we watched the water boil without saying anything . That 's when it happened . <p> Mitchell was fooling with the coffee and I was still pretty bleary-eyed , so I 'm not sure just exactly what I saw . Mitchell was stirring the coffee and he turned to me . " Ummm . Smell those enzymes . " <p> He said it perfectly natural and I would n't have taken much notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the library and it 's a chemical term , I forget what it means . Mitchell would never have said something like that . And I would n't have given it any mind , except that just then his arm stuck a little farther out of the denim work shirt he had on . He has big arms and thick wrists . As the shirt slid up I saw the skin and curly hair and then something else . <p> At first I thought it was leather . Then it seemed like cloth , real old fabric , wrinkled and coarse . Mitchell turned further and looked at me and that 's when I heard the sound of him moving . It was like dry leaves rustling . Old and blowing in a wind . In the next second I caught a whiff of it and the worse smell I ever knew came swarming up into my head and I finally really saw what the thing next to me was . <p> I do n't want to describe that . It sent me banging back against the plywood wall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed with me somehow even in the open . I was off into the pines way back of my place before I knew it . <p> I had the shakes for hours . Made myself circle around for three miles . Got to my sister 's place . Did n't tell her anything about it but I think she might of guessed . I was pale and woozy . <p> I got my truck and went off to Pensacola for a week . There was maybe some work there but it did n't pan out and I had n't gone for that anyway . <p> I did n't go back into my place for another week . And I was real careful when I did . <p> It was all picked up , neat as you please . Not a sign . Mitchell was a fine man but he would never have done that . <p> I stood in the kitchen and tried to work out what had happened , how it had been . Could n't . There was that one second when I saw straight into whatever was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had tried to blend in with them . And I 'd helped him . So in some way maybe this was the reverse . Or a pay back , kind of . Or maybe a signal or something . No way to tell . <p> Only , you know what I think ? I figure there is n't any Mitchell anymore . There 's something else . <p> Now , could be there 's still some Mitchell in there , only he ca n't get out . Or maybe that thing 's Alpha for sure . I guess it could be something in between . Only thing I know is , it is n't anything I ever want to know . <p> Maybe it 's something I ca n't know . Thing about aliens is , they 're alien . <p> They say that one Alpha still hangs out at Nan 's . I have n't been to check . I do n't even walk down that part of town anymore . <p> <p> <p> By Gregory Benford <p> F &SF; science columnist Gregory Benford appears this issue with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , among them Timescape ( which won the Nebula ) and Beyond the Fall of Night , written with Arthur C.
