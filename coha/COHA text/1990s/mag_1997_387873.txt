A benign spring evening ends in bloody murder and the arrest of two teens Photograph A " He was like a rebel once he met Daphne , " a friend says of Christopher Vasquez . Photograph Daphne Abdela was " unpredictable and wild , " according to one teen who met her . // John Lennon might have been pleased . Each night in warm weather , the area in New York City 's Central Park known as Strawberry Fields in memory of the Beatle murdered just steps away becomes a meeting ground for an eclectic group of revelers . Bedraggled flower children , down-ontheir-luck vagrants and yuppies with a taste for adventure gather to share good vibes , along with ample quantities of beer and marijuana . " It 's all about love here , " says regular Eric Horvitz , 34 , a struggling singer who is currently homeless . " It 's a very peaceful place to be . " Most of the time . Last week police arraigned two teenagers , Christopher Vasquez , la , and his girlfriend Daphne Abdela , also 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23 they had brutally murdered Michael McMorrow , 44 , who had been drinking with them in the park . Not only had the victim been stabbed more than two dozen times , but his head had been slashed from ear to ear and his torso slit open . McMorrow was a well-known habitue of Strawberry Fields . By day he worked at a real estate agency on the West Side of Manhattan , where he had earned a reputation as a conscientious employee . But several nights a week , McMorrow-who was single and lived with his 80-year-old mother , Margaret-would pick up a supply of beer and head for the park , where he would drink until the wee hours and sometimes smoke a little dope . Garrulous and good-natured , he was known for his comic impersonations , as well as for his unfailing generosity . " He would give you the shirt off his back , " says Horvitz . At around 6 p.m. on that final Thursday evening , McMorrow went to the park carrying a couple of large cans of Guinness . Several hours later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the teenagers , who have been dating for only a few weeks , are an unlikely match . Vasquez , from a working-class family , lives in a modest walk-up on the Upper East Side . Abdela , by contrast , is the indulged only child of an affluent couple . Her home is a duplex in the Majestic , a tony apartment building on Central Park West , where she lives with her adoptive parents-father Angelo , a top executive at CPC International , a major food-products company in New Jersey , and Catherine , a French-born former model . In other respects , though , the pair have much in common . Both are bright : Abdela attended the Jesuit-run Loyola School , whose 200 students are admitted on the basis of a competitive exam , while Vasquez is an excellent student at the elite private Beekman School , where he is apparently on scholarship . More to the point , each had a troubled history . Reportedly , Abdela had been asked to leave two schools and was looking for a boarding school to attend in the fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl . " She was a mystery to her parents , " one family friend told the Daily News . " They were almost afraid . " In recent years she had been treated for substance abuse but lately was seen drinking often and heavily , even on the street during the day ( Abdela has a juvenile record , which is sealed . ) Photograph Victim Michael McMorrow used to delight friends with his keen impressions of such stars as James Cagney and Jackie Gleason .

In fact friends and neighbors call him quiet and well-mannered . By all accounts the breakup two years ago of his parents-Gerardo , who has worked as a doorman and in a carpet store , and Patricia-had added to his numerous problems : he was being treated with Iorazepam , a sedative , and Zoloft , an antidepressant . According to one who was there , Vasquez was upset and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the park . They and several others began drinking , with Abdela at one point going to a local convenience store , where she reportedly had a tab , to buy more beer . Around midnight , say witnesses , McMorrow and the two teens headed toward a gazebo by the park lake . An hour later , Horvitz heard three bloodcurdling screams for help . About the same time , Abdela 's father , concerned that she had n't come home , called police and reported her missing . The officers who arrived at her building found Abdela and Vasquez in a utility room washing blood off themselves . Unaware that any crime had been committed , the police accepted the couple 's explanation that Vasquez had fallen while Rollerblading and left . But less than an hour later , authorities received an anonymous call to 911 . The caller said a friend had " jumped in the lake and did n't come out . " Police traced the tip to the Abdela residence , and Daphne-under questioning and ignoring her father 's pleas to say nothing without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the murder scene . When McMorrow 's mutilated body was fished out of the water , she reportedly said , " I tried to help you ; I tried to give you CPR . " According to the prosecutor , though , it was Abdela who had suggested disemboweling the corpse so " it would sink . " Initially , as prosecutors announced that the two would be tried as adults , Abdela 's lawyer signaled that he intended to paint his client as an innocent witness to a terrible crime , while Vasquez 's attorney floated a possible defense based on the mix of medication and alcohol that his client had taken . ( Last week , though , both suspects hired new attorneys . ) Police remain unsure of the motive for the killing . And park denizens are no less bewildered . " They were regular teens , " says a man who used to hang out with them . " They seemed like brother and sister , like two kids who had grown up together .
