<p> Think they do n't make ' em like they used to ? Well you 're right , but not in the way you might think . Peel away the fog of nostalgia and you find the good old days really were n't so good after all , at least as far as engines are concerned . <p> In the early 1950s , the average passenger car engine lasted just 45,000 miles , according to Chevron . By 1990 , that life expectancy had more than doubled , with engines routinely running 100,000 miles or more before a rebuild . <p> A lot of things have helped stretch the life of engines . Corrosive acids in the crankcase have been reduced , thanks to unleaded gasoline , higher operating temperatures , and better positive crankcase ventilation systems . Materials and machining are much improved . And fuel injection has all but eliminated the raw gasoline that used to wash down the cylinder walls of a cold engine . <p> But much of the credit for longer engine life belongs to better motor oils . In the last four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflected in the letter-by-letter march of the API ( American Petroleum Institute ) Service Categories , which have gone from a low rating of SA and SB for the oils typically used in the 1950s to the high rating SG oil that 's now standard . <p> Unlike overhead cams , fuel injectors , and other mechanical advances , changes in motor oil have been all but invisible . Take a bottle of nondetergent SA oil ( if you can still find one ) and pour it into a pan . Do the same with Mobil 1 , a megabuck synthetic with an SG/CD rating . Both look pretty much the same . Yet the nondetergent oil will quickly destroy a modern engine , while a top synthetic can help stretch its life to a quarter million miles and beyond . Understanding Oil <p> When it comes out of the ground , petroleum is a blend of hundreds of different hydrocarbons , ranging from tarlike asphalts to volatile liquids such as benzene . Refining separates this crude oil into dozens of useful compounds . The stuff in the middle-not too thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In the early days , oil went straight from the refinery into the engine , because engines were lightly stressed . Oil change intervals were short , maybe 1,000 to 3,000 miles . Nevertheless , shops replaced a lot of worn engine parts . A typical trade magazine of the 1930s , 40s , or 50s was packed with ads for pistons , rings , bearings and other high-wear parts . Stories such as a November 1960 MOTOR Magazine feature on how to clean clogged oil passages were common . <p> All that has changed . The evolution of engines has been matched by a rapid evolution in motor oils . Filters have changed too , although to a lesser extent . Still more changes are in the works . To understand how all these changes came about , we need to review quickly the jobs oil is expected to perform . <p> The primary job of any motor oil is to prevent metal-to-metal contact of moving parts . Even the most finely machined pieces have tiny imperfections on their surfaces . If the surfaces are allowed to rub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high spots together . The parts then tear apart , weld together again , and so on . The result is what technicians call scuffing . If this goes on very long , the pieces weld together permanently , and seizure occurs . <p> Forcing a film of oil between moving parts prevents this metal-to-metal contact , all but eliminating friction . In rod bearings and other high-stress parts , this film is created by pumping oil under pressure between the surfaces . Other parts such as piston rings create their own wedge of oil as they slide across a surface oiled by crankshaft splash or through spurt holes of existing rods <p> Oil chemists refer to this as thick film lubrication , despite the fact that these films are sometimes just .000025 inch thick  --  or about 1/50 the diameter of a human hair . The thickness of this film is determined by the viscosity of the oil , which has led to the myth that thicker oil must be better . ( More on that later . ) <p> While thick-film lubrication is important , it 's just one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perform . Others include thin-film lubrication , control of engine deposits , and corrosion prevention . <p> Thin-film lubrication is one of the toughest to understand . There are areas in engines where thick films simply ca n't form between parts , either because the relative speeds are too low for the moving parts to form an oil wedge , the loads are too high , or both . As a result , metal-to-metal contact occurs . To prevent parts welding and catastrophic wear , oils contain anti-wear additives , the most common of which are zinc dithiophosphates ( the important stuff in engine assembly lubes ) . At the point where the metal surfaces touch and temperatures start to soar , these antiwear agents form a thin film of inorganic material between the parts . This film shears much more easily than the base metal , so the parts can slide without a meltdown . <p> Naturally , antiwear additives eventually get used up , which is one reason oil has to be changed periodically . Also , antiwear additives work better when the oil is at normal operating temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typical engine  --  a good reason not to put a cold engine under heavy stress . <p> Another family of oil additives , friction modifiers , have become increasingly important as engineers seek ever-higher fuel economy . In a running engine , about 70% of lubricant-related friction is caused by the molecules in the oil film rubbing together . Carmakers have reduced this friction by going to lower-viscosity oil . <p> The other 30% is due to the actual rubbing of the parts separated by thin film lubricants . Friction modifiers further smooth this surface-to-surface contact , resulting in a small but measurable reduction in friction . <p> While antiwear additives , friction modifiers , and the oil itself are combatting wear , another family of additives  --  detergents and dispersants  --  keep carbon , sludge , and varnish from clogging up the works . <p> Sludge and varnish come from a number of sources . Water vapor , nitrogen compounds , and bits of carbon find their way past the rings , as do gum-forming compounds created by pockets of incomplete combustion . For the most part , these bits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so the detergents and dispersants just hold them in suspension , keeping them circulating with the oil until it 's drained . <p> If the detergents and the dispersants wear out , or if so much crud accumulates that the oil can no longer hold it , sludge and varnish quickly coat the inside of the engine . <p> Still other additives fight the slow corrosion caused by acids in the oil . High sulfur fuel and leaded gas were major sources of these powerful acids , and the reduction of sulfur and the elimination of lead have definitely made life easier for engines and oils . Nitrogen-based acids , water , and exotic compounds such as organic peroxides are still a threat , however , so anticorrosion additives are an important part of modern oils . While these and other additives are vital , it 's worth noting that too much of any one additive can throw off the balance of the whole package , actually creating engine problems . Also , extra additives ca n't revitalize worn-out oil . Consequently , carmakers and oil companies almost always recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How Viscosity Grades Differ . Almost all widely available oils now meet the API SG service rating , indicating that the oil has acceptable levels of antiwear additives , detergents , dispersants , and the like . Where consumers are more likely to encounter problems is in selecting oil of the correct viscosity . <p> Viscosity measures how thick an oil is at a given temperature . The standard system for measuring viscosity , set up by the Society of Automotive Engineers ( SAE ) in 1911 , includes ten grades , OW through 25W for oils designed to flow effectively at low temperatures ( the W stands for winter ) , and 20 through 60 for oils rated at 212 degrees F. <p> Single-grade oils , commonly used until the 1960s , posed a real problem . Thicker oils would n't flow at low temperatures , resulting in hard starting and rapid wear . Winter grade oils , on the other hand , thinned out in a hot engine to the point where oil consumption soared . Sometimes the oil thinned out enough to allow metal-to-metal contact between parts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oils by adding long-chain polymers called viscosity index ( VI ) improvers to low-viscosity base oil . These multigrade oils promised the best of both grades : The oil stayed thin at low temperatures for easy starting , low-wear , and reduced friction , yet equalled the high-temperature performance of a higher viscosity straight-weight . <p> Early multigrade oils had a bad reputation . But almost all carmakers now recommend 5W-30 or 10W-30 oil , even for their highest performance engines . Synthetics from companies such as Mobil , Quaker State , and Valvoline even have race-engine builders switching to multigrades , something that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago . <p> No car company engineer I 've talked to recently recommends 10W-40 although it remains popular on the do-it-yourself market . The extra viscosity at higher temperatures sounds good , but the extra dose of VI improver tends to cause ring sticking and other problems . The same problem can occur with those honey-colored oil additives , which are little more than VI improver in a can . <p> What Experts Recommend . Ask almost any carmaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back the same : a 5W-30 or 10W-30 oil with an API SG service rating , preferably one that also carries the Energy Conserving II label . <p> Generally , 5W-30 is recommended for really cold weather , while 10W-30 is the choice when the weather warms . A few carmakers still allow the use of 15W-40 or 20W-50 when things get really hot . Check the owner 's manual if you 're unsure . <p> Now 10W-30 looks pretty thin when you pour it out of a bottle on a warm day . That should n't disturb you , says Peter W. Misangyi , supervisor of the fuels and lubricants section for Ford 's engine division . " Because it 's thinner at room temperature , people assume it 's thinner when it gets hot . But all oil thins when it gets hot . " <p> Thinner oil has a couple advantages over thicker stuff . Most important , it flows more quickly when the engine is started . Engineers now understand that significant amounts of engine wear occur in those first few moments after startup . So fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few extra psi of oil pressure when the engine is hot . That 's especially true with overhead-cam engines , where critical bearings and cam lobes are high above the oil supply . <p> Lightweight oils formulated to meet Energy Conserving and Energy Conserving II standards can also significantly reduce friction . An Energy Conserving II oil typically reduces friction 2.7% over a traditional oil , says Misangyi . " That 's not something the average driver will see . But a 1% improvement in average fuel economy can save the country $1 billion a year in oil imports . " <p> Ask any engine engineer at a car company what brand of oil he recommends and you 'll usually get the politically correct answer : Motorcraft at Ford , Goodwrench at GM , and so on . The answer is n't entirely bull . Carmakers are paranoid about engine quality . Their reputation ( and warranty costs ) suffer if the oil does n't do its job . So they keep a careful eye on their oil suppliers , making sure each batch of oil really does meet the standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineers will also mention one other oil  --  Mobil 1  --  which brought the advantages of synthetic oil into the mainstream . <p> Where Synthetics Are Leading . Unlike traditional oils , which are blends of dozens of different hydrocarbons , synthetic oils are built up in the laboratory from molecules chosen for specific properties . This allows the oil chemist to tailor the oil to specific needs , and avoid some of the problems inherent in traditional oils . <p> Because synthetic oils do n't contain the traces of wax found in traditional oil , they stay thinner at colder temperatures , providing better flow . Mobil claims that Mobil 1 is also far more stable during high-heat , high-load running , so it thickens less than conventional oils as it ages . <p> Mobil introduced Mobil 1 in 1976 , claiming it reduced friction , extended oil life , and provided better cold starting and high- temperature protection . A number of smaller companies also jumped into the synthetic market , most with products aimed at racing or other specialized niches . <p> Late in 1990 , Quaker State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 5W-50 ( a pure synthetic ) and 5W-40 ( a synthetic/petroleum mix ) grades . <p> Last year , Valvoline waded in with a family of synthetics aimed at professional and amateur racers . Mobil then unveiled a second generation Mobil 1 , promoting the product with test engines that had logged 200,000 miles with no significant wear . <p> There are still some backyard chemists in the synthetic oil business , and Mobil 's testing indicates that good conventional oils are superior to some cheaper synthetics . But the best of the synthetics are very , very good  --  so good that race-engine builders are switching fast . <p> The problem ? Price . For ordinary drivers , synthetics may not be worth $3.50 to $9 a quart . The one exception may be in the frigid north , where synthetics ' superior cold starting may be worth almost any price . More Changes Coming <p> With the durability and efficiency of engines so closely tied to the quality of the oil , it 's no surprise that carmakers want still better quality motor oils . Now . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the International Lubricant Standardization and Approval Committee ( ILSAC ) . The new standard will go into effect in mid-1993 . Oils that comply with the standard will display a symbol that 's still being designed . <p> The symbol will consolidate the API service rating , Energy Conserving rating , and viscosity rating into a single rating . Consumers can simply look for the ILSAC symbol and know that the oil meets carmakers ' latest performance standards . <p> The new rating reflects a certain dissatisfaction with the current system , which is jointly administered by SAE , API , and the American Society for Testing and Materials ( ASTM ) . First , the current system has responded too slowly to changes in engines , says the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association , which is spearheading the new standard . Some cars from the early 1980s really needed SG oil , but delays in the system meant oil meeting the classification was n't widely available until 1988 . <p> Also , the current system is self-policing , and spot checks by SAE show that a significant percentage of oil is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most recent survey , the Society found that 7.3% of the oils sampled were mislabeled , with viscosity or additive packages that did n't meet the specifications on the label . <p> Theoretically , the new ILSAC specification will give carmakers more power to withhold approval of substandard oils . How well this will work in practice remains to be seen . <p> Also watch for a continuing trend toward lighter oils , with 5W-20 and even OW-20 oils likely to appear by the end of the decade . Synthetic blends and highly refined mineral oils that mimic synthetics will bridge the cost and performance gap between conventional oils and true synthetics . And the move toward alternative fuel vehicles will lead to oils designed specifically for engines burning methanol , natural gas , etc . <p> Finally , expect carmakers to experiment with a module that combines a filter and a reservoir for a dry-sump oil system . Developed by Fram , the module would allow technicians or do-it-yourselfers quickly and cleanly to change the oil and filter . <p> ILLUSTRATION : Oil can <p> By Tom Wilkinson <p> <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Automotive Engineers and a senior editor in Detroit for MOTOR Magazine , from which this is reprinted . <p>
