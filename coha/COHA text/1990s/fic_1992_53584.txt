LUIS HAD NEVER SEEN anything like New York City . Though he had lived in crowded , metropolitan La Paz for thirteen years ( he had just celebrated his fourteenth birthday in Weston , Connecticut with the Winstons , whose house he was living in as an exchange student ) , New York continued to amaze him . He had visited from Connecticut three times : once for the lighting of the tree at Rockefeller Center ; once to see Phantom of the Opera ; and once to SoHo to have cappuccino and to look at large paintings  --  grids and blocks of color that made him think of children 's toys filled with helium , quickly floating away . <p> Today Luis was in New York with Harold , the Winston 's oldest son . Harold  --  known to everyone as " Her "  --  was separated from his wife and children in Ann Arbor . He had stopped to see his parents on his way south to visit his former college roommate . The night before , the Winstons had gone to bed early , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put away . Har had pointed to the picture of the two of them on their wedding day and said , " You think that 's an angel . You think I 'm the devil . I 've got news for you : this is n't a medieval morality play . It 's a comedy of manners . I only married her because I was on the rebound , and then what happened but her old flame showed up , and high hilarity ensued . He moved right into the house  --  but what else could be done , because he 'd ha  --  get this  --  brain surgery , and no one else was available to nurse him back to health . Roll the drums ! Bring on the feather dusters and the ladies in crinoline ! " Mrs. Winston went directly upstairs after Har 's outburst . Mr. Winston followed . When they left the room , Har suggested he and Luis might go to the store and rent a couple of videos . They decided on Dreamchild and Down and Out in Beverly Hills . The next morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into New York . <p> It was a hot day , and the air conditioning was broken in the car . As Har drove , they talked about music . Har was very enthusiastic about U2 . Luis learned that Joshua Tree was a place in the desert . Then , somehow , they began to talk about the terrain of Bolivia . Luis remembered , with nostalgia , the Andes : the snow-capped peaks , white even in summer . Har said that his soon-to-be-ax-wife liked to ski . <p> In the city , Har parked in an enormous lot on the West Side . He stopped at the phone to call a woman he knew on 20th Street . Her outgoing message said she would be out of town until Sunday night . Har shrugged ; he said to Luis that since it was Sunday , she might be back soon . <p> Several blocks later , he stopped at another phone . " Here , " Har said , taking a quarter out of his pocket . " You listen to the message , and when it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend , and that we 'll call later . " <p> " Why ca n't you do it ? " Luis said . <p> Har picked up the phone , deposited a quarter , dialed , and handed the phone to Luis . <p> " Hello ? " a woman 's voice said . <p> In his surprise , Luis blurted , " Hello ? " <p> " Who is this ? " the woman said . <p> " Her 's friend , " he said . " I 'm calling for Har . " <p> " Harold ? " the woman said . " What about him ? " <p> Luis looked quickly over his shoulder . Har was watching a hunch backed woman driving by in a little motorized car . Her white scarf blew in the wind . " Take it ! " Luis whispered , holding out the phone . " Har  --  she 's on the phone ! " <p> " I was just thinking , " Har said . " The last time we got together , dinner was supposed to be on her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luis put the phone to his ear . The woman had hung up ; all he heard was the dial tone . <p> " Who was she ? " Luis said , frowning as he hung up . <p> " Just somebody I knew in college . She calls herself an actress . Did a play at Long Wharf and a detergent commercial . As far as I know , that 's her career . " <p> " My mother 's best friend is an actress , " Luis said . <p> " Speaking of which  --  do you miss them ? How come you wanted to come to the U.S. of A. ? " <p> " My parents thought my uncle was moving to Buffalo , " Luis said , hurrying to keep up with Har . " And then when he did n't go , my father found out about the student exchange program . " <p> " You know , " Har said , " some adults buddy up to kids and ask them personal questions , but I 've never liked that . I 've been along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex , or fooled around with drugs . What he drinks . That kind of stuff . But I do n't think that 's anybody 's business . The same way you 're not supposed to needle somebody about their religion . If they bring it up , fine . But that 's another matter . " <p> " I 'm Catholic , " Luis said . <p> Har looked at him . " I think I knew that , " he said . " I think my parents mentioned going to some Christmas Eve service with you . " <p> " I do n't go every Sunday , " Luis said . " My mother , I would say , is the only devoutly religious member of our family . " <p> They had been walking crosstown , on a block where men stood in baggy pants and T-shirts , playing their radios , or clustered to play cards . Har saw a man cleaning his knife blade . He hailed the first cab that passed . <p> " Tower Records . Near there . I 'll tell you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o ' power , " the cabbie said . " Wish I owned stock . " <p> " Been in a New York cab before ? " Har asked Luis . <p> " Yes . I 've taken cabs with your parents every time I 've been here , ' Luis said . <p> " Yeah , they 're getting old . My father used to make it a point of honor to ride the subway . He knows them like the back of his hand . But you get old and tired , it does n't matter what you know . That 's when you do what you want , instead of what you know about . " <p> At the next light , Har told the driver to stop . He gave the driver several wadded-up dollar bills and told him to keep the change . When they got out , they were in front of a store with black mannequins wearing pillbox hats and mannequins painted bright green standing inside piles of hula-hoops . Inside , Har headed for the shirt rack . " Look , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a name sewn somewhere . These were a big thing in the fifties . You can pick who you want to be . " He pulled a shirt off the rack . " Ed " was sewn over the pocket , and " Mandell 's Plumbing " was stitched in big letters across the back . It was a two-tone shirt , with red in front and white and red stripes in back . " Size large , " Har said . " Looks like I 've found one right off the bat . " <p> " Off the bat , " Luis echoed , flipping through the shirts . The one he liked was aqua , with white piping around the sleeves and " Dave " sewn with grey thread over the front pocket . " Dawson 's Lawn Service , " it said on the back . <p> Har paid for the shirts . Outside , they stuffed the shirts they 'd been wearing in the bag . Each bit off the other 's price tag . Har nodded his approval , and they continued their walk . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Har said . " His name is Allen Purvis . <p> He 's an actor , too . His show got canceled . Last I heard , he was living on unemployment and writing a novel about an unemployed actor . " <p> As they turned onto East 7th , they crossed the street . Har went into a store that sold lingerie . He took a pair of underpants off a hanger and dangled them from his thumb , considering them . They were lavender lace . Har raised his eyebrows and smiled . The saleswoman took his money and wrapped them in pink tissue paper , then put them in a tiny bag . They were the fanciest panties Luis had ever seen . <p> A few buildings past the store , they crossed the street again . Luis followed Har up the steps of a brownstone . He rang the buzzer . There was no intercom , so their first sight of Allen Purvis was at the door . He was wearing white shorts and rubber thongs . " Son of a bitch ! " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide ; he kept them above his head as Allen embraced him . <p> " What have we here ? " Allen said . " We have Ed and Dave , I see , come for a visit . " He smiled at Luis . <p> " This is my adopted son , " Har said . " We thought we 'd come by and become characters in your book . " <p> " Full of surprises , this life , " Allen said . " Do come in . " <p> They followed him down a corridor to another door , which was already open . " Unbelievable , " Allen said . " What are you doing in town , Har ? " <p> The phone rang . Allen ignored it , clapping Har on the back and steering him toward the front of the apartment . As Luis trailed behind , he saw that Allen 's shorts were split . They had been sewn with red thread . <p> " Sit down , gentlemen , " he said . " I happen to have a bottle of champagne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply indebted to me for watering her plants for two weeks while they cut out half her stomach . Please : sit down and prepare yourselves for pleasure . " Allen turned and almost ran to the kitchen . As he went through the glass beads , he kicked one foot high in the air behind him . <p> Luis looked at Har . He had expected some sign when Allen went into the kitchen  --  a wink , or something . Instead , Har sank into a chair , dropping the bag and pushing it aside with his foot . " I seem to be a bit tired , " Har said to Luis . <p> As Allen returned with a bottle of champagne and three stacked water glasses , Har said , " You know , my friend here is actually an exchange student from Bolivia . He 's been living with my parents in Weston . " " Really ? " Allen said . " Then let 's have a toast to him . You make the toast , Har . " <p> Har sighed . He watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't even have a marriage anymore , let alone an adopted son . Susan 's reunited with her former love . No kidding : he came to Michigan to court her again , got a brain tumor , and we spent three weeks in the hospital , sleeping in chairs . Man is very , very sick . This made clear to her her love for him . " <p> " To good health , " Allen said , raising his glass . <p> The phone rang again . This time , Allen went over to where it sat on the floor and turned up the volume control . " Juliettel " he said , pouncing on the phone . " Juliette , my most darling . You 're back from the beach early . " <p> " The person we called earlier ? " Luis said to Har . <p> " The very , " Har said . <p> " Juliette . There is a surprise for you , if you come right over , " Allen <p> Har looked at Luis . He rolled his eyes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe it 's time to take off if Juliette 's coming over . " <p> " But you were going to see her , " Luis said . <p> " No , darling . Not recruiting you to play bridge with the woman upstairs . Just inviting you to a celebration , of sorts . " <p> " Maybe we should get a pizza , " Har said , getting out of his chair . " I 'm pretty hungry . How about you ? " <p> " Sure , " Luis said . <p> " No , darling , " Allen said into the phone . " Nothing nasty at all . A pleasant surprise . " <p> Outside , a bum asked for a quarter , and Har gave it to him . " It 's none of my business , " Har said , " but what do you want to be , Luis ? " <p> " I think I 'd like to be an illustrator . " <p> " Illustrations ? Did n't my mother say something about your going to medical school ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I want to draw . I want to draw things for books . I 'm interested in botany . " <p> " Really ? " Har said . " I 'll bet my mother likes that . Nobody in her family is at all visual . She likes Toulouse-Lautrec . Did you know that ? " <p> " Oh , yes . " <p> " Those damn paintings were nightmares to me when I was a kid . That one of the woman with the blue face ? She could n't have hung a three-headed monster and scared me more . " <p> " Whaddya want ? " the counterman said . He had on a white shirt and a gold chain with a silver cross dangling from it . There was crosshatching on the silver . Many people in Bolivia wore such crosses . <p> " Cheese , sausage , and still more cheese , " Har said . <p> " Sure you do n't want a fondue ? " the counterman said . <p> Luis leaned against the counter , like Har . " The mother of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great depression is coming , " Luis said . " She 's a very good watercolorist . She told me that when she was my age , both her parents died , and she was raised by an aunt . The aunt hit her if she saw her drawing , because she thought drawing was a waste of her mind . " <p> " Some days , I do n't know how anybody survives , " Har sighed . <p> " Being hit for drawing still makes her very mad , " Luis said . <p> When their pizza was ready , the man slid it into a box and taped the top closed . Har paid for it , and they walked outside . The man who had asked for a quarter before asked for another . " No can do , " Har said . <p> " Fuck your " the man shouted . <p> The doughy smell of the pizza , mixed with the smell of gasoline as someone tried to start his car at the curb , made Luis a little lightheaded . He hurried to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Allen 's kitchen door ? " Har said , as they walked up the steps to the brownstone . Luis rang the bell . " That 's because when he did n't have any money , back in the days when he was waiting for calls from his agent , Juliette offered him ten bucks for the door , and he sold it to her . He found the beads in the trash later that week , on Avenue A. " Har shook his head , as if baffled by something . He said : " She wanted to turn her bathtub into a table . She had one of those claw-footed numbers in her kitchen , and she wanted to turn the tub into a table when she was n't using it , so she bought the door so she could have a table . " <p> Luis nodded . Allen Purvis threw open the door . <p> " Remember Juliette 's table ? " Har said to Allen . <p> " Do I remember the table ? I mean , if not for my generosity , there would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She painted the door green , and there were blue Fiestaware plates . It was very fashionable . And she made sushi before anyone ever heard of it . Boy  --  those were some strange times . " <p> They went back to the front room . Allen had put out plates and folded squares of paper towels . A Swiss Army knife sat on one of the plates . Allen clicked out a blade and offered it to Har to cut the pizza . <p> They were finishing their first slices when Juliette rang the doorbell . She came in carrying a bottle of wine and a loaf of French bread . " Harold ! " she screamed , when she saw Har . " What is going on here ? No word from Harold Winston for two years at least , and here he is in New York City , and . . . with another gentleman I do n't believe I 've been introduced to . " <p> " His adopted son , " Luis said , extending his hand . <p> " Harold ! " Juliette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old friends ? " <p> Har shrugged . Outside , someone passed by with a radio . Michael Jackson was squealing . A car screeched away from the curb , and the gasoline fumes began to waft through the window . Reaching for another slice of pizza , Luis thought : I am going to remember this day . Not because it was a typical day , or because anything very important was happening , but because of the way they all seemed to be drifting , as if they , too , were part of the breeze . This day had nothing to do with the way people visited and talked in La Paz ; there , people spoke more formally , as if they were interviewing one another . <p> " This is the last thing I would have expected , " Juliette said , sitting near Har 's feet . " Harold Winston back in town , with his son , and me , sitting by his side . " <p> " This is the very woman who asked Allen to take his door off the hinges and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next door , " Har said to Luis . <p> " Five , " Juliette said . " I got it on the cheap . " <p> " You paid me ten , " Allen said . <p> " Well ! " Juliette said , reaching up for Har 's champagne glass . He gave it to her . She took a sip . " Another surprise , " she said . " That Allen , who speaks so often about how cheap I am when my back is turned , tonight asserts that I offered twice the money I did for his kitchen door . " <p> " We 've got to get going , " Har said abruptly , as Juliette handed his glass up to him . <p> " Oh , Harold , " Juliette said . " Is n't that just like you ? So mercurial . So **36;0;TOOLONG . " <p> Har stood . With great mock-seriousness , he said , " Then . . . can you get along without me ? " <p> As he watched , Luis had a crazy thought . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shook it hard with his thumb over the top , then pointed it at Juliette and let the champagne fly , the white foam shooting out with more force than he would have thought possible . <p> " Oh God , he is your son , " Allen laughed . <p> " Apparently , " Juliette said . She was angry , but she looked at Har , not at Luis . " Do you know what this proves ? " she said . " It proves that whenever more than one man is present , there 's always competition for my affection . I thought the trouble might only be between you and Allen , Harold , but I see your son has added himself as another potential candidate . " <p> Luis tried to look as unsurprised as Allen and Har as Juliette slowly unbuttoned her soaked blouse , then let it drop to the floor . She stood there in a white brassiere and a pearl necklace , looking at all of them in turn . She stared at Har until he dropped his eyes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said makes a lot of sense , does n't it , Allen ? " she said , and then he , too , looked away . Luis was the last one to be gazed upon , and in the moments before she shifted her attention to him , he had had time to think . She turned to him , and he reached forward , dipping his hand into the bag and carefully extracting the little package wrapped in pink tissue paper . " For you , Juliette , " he said . <p> She was so surprised , she took it from his hand and opened it . In the few seconds it took her to remove the lavender pants from the tissue paper , and before she burst into wild laughter , Har thought : Oh , what the hell . What was the chance of its working , anyway ? The reconciliation with his wife . <p> <p> By ANN BEATTIE <p>
