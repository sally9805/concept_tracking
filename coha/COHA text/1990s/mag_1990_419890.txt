Section : PIX Commercial Applications of Realist Art <p> Creating illustrations and ads for prominent accounts has enabled this husband-and-wife team to focus on their own personal paintings . <p> Together Todd Schorr and his wife , Kathy Staico Schorr , run an extremely successful design-illustration studio called Tod-Kat Studios in Roxbury , Connecticut . But despite their success , the couple are never fully satisfied and they continue to strive for new goals . Both partners in this unique husband-and-wife team entered the field of commercial art so that they could afford to make their own personal paintings , and they are always looking for ways of exhibiting their fine-art work and of producing income from this endeavor . <p> Todd Schorr , currently one of the country 's most prominent airbrush artists , first entertained the notion of becoming an artist as a child , but he came to believe in the myth that all artists eventually starve in a garret . As a result , he decided to pursue illustration . The choice was not just a compromise , though ; it served as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by sources ranging from Salvador Dali 's Surrealistic paintings to Walt Disney and Warner Brothers cartoons . " I have always been drawn to popular imagery , " he explains , " and to colorful , splashy art I never cared much for abstract work ; I was drawn , to figurative , realistic paintings . They excited me . When I applied to art school to study illustration , I dreamed that someday I might be lucky enough to get a job as an artist for the Disney studios . " <p> Born in 1954 in New York City , Todd grew up in Oakland , New Jersey , and after finishing high school attended the Philadelphia College of Art ( PCA ) , graduating in 1976 . His talent and drive were strongly in evidence there . During his senior year , for example , he won the school 's Ely Award for illustration and , perhaps even more impressive , he worked as a professional illustrator for prominent accounts during his last two years of art school . <p> One of Todd 's most inspiring experiences occurred during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of youth , the artist relates , " A friend end I used to ride the train into New York City from Philadelphia occasionally and take it 0upon ourselves of some of the artists we most were just going something . " <p> In this way Todd was first exposed to the airbrush . He had seen the work of airbrush expert Charlie White , and when he went into the Manhattan with his friend , the two were able to get White 's studio address from the Society of Illustrators . Unannounced , they went directly to White 's studio . " The doors were wide open , " says Todd , " so we just wandered in . Charlie was great . He was very busy that day , but nevertheless he seemed delighted that we had dropped by . He showed us his portfolio and even gave us a few rudimentary tips on using the airbrush . When I think of that visit , I become ore and more impressed the he took the time to spend with us  --  a couple of bumbling kids . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when one of his illustration professors at PCA recommended him to his own agent in New York City . Soon thereafter , Todd was creating editorial assignments for Playboy and for publications for the children 's television programs Sesame Street and The Electric Company . Subsequently , he became involved in advertising projects for such impressive clients as Burger King and Pepsi-Cola . <p> While in college , Todd met Kathy Staico , an artist and designer who had attended PCA for a year and was taking time off to work for a local studio . In 1977 , after Kathy had finished her degree , they moved to New York City together and , in 1979 , they got married and opened Tod-Kat Studios on Lexington Avenue in Manhattan . Since then , Todd has done eight covers for Time magazine , as well as editorial work for Money , Fortune , Science Digest , Playboy , National Lampoon , Psychology Today , and Esquire . Together , Todd and Kathy 's advertising clients have included Coca-Cola , Pepsi-Cola , TWA , Burger King , Dr. Pepper , Budweiser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &T,; ABC Television , Atlantic Records , and Hostess Cupcakes . In keeping with the colorful , popular , and often playful imagery that had originally inspired him to become an artist , he has also created characters for some Milton Bradley board games . In addition , from 1977 until 1980 , both Todd and Kathy were heavily involved in Paper Moon Graphics , a company in Los Angeles that produces greeting-card designs , Christmas-tree ornaments , and paper masks . More recently , Kathy as been doing a series of book-cover illustrations . <p> One of Todd 's better-known projects is a group of illustrations for Bette Midler 's The Saga of Baby Divine , a best-selling book published by Crown Books in 1983 that was at one point number one on Time magazine 's best-seller list and number three on that of The New York Times . Todd became involved with the project through Brad Benedict a close friend who is the creator of Heaven retail stores and cofounder of Paper Moon Graphics . Benedict , who was working on one of his own projects at Crown Books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work with Midler and recommended him . After submitting their portfolios , the artist being considered were asked to submit sketches of their concept of how the title character , Baby M. , would look . Todd 's concept was chosen , and Crown Books asked him to travel to California to work with Midler . <p> The process for working on the book was collaborative : " I sat down with Bette and we traded ideas back and forth , and she made suggestions while I doodled , " says the artist . " The original baby was very Kewpie-like ; the face was a lot fatter than it actually appeared to be in the book . Bette gave me her ideas of the appearance of each character and I drew them . Often she compared her ideas of the characters to old movie stars to help me get started . " After a week of working together , the two had created a look for each of the book 's characters . At this point , Todd was ready to make the actual drawings for publication . Originally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but as a result of pressure from the publishers , they were created in about five months . Todd remembers the experience as " crazy , " but remains grateful for the excitement and exposure of working with a celebrity , which brought him national attention . <p> In their commercial work , both artists use a similar process that incorporates a variety of materials , including Liquitex acrylics , Winsor &; Newton gouache , Dr. Martin 's dyes , Winsor &; Newton oils , Winsor &; Newton brushes , and Iwata airbrushes . The surfaces they work on are usually canvas , illustration board , or Arches 300-pound paper . Both artists also combine traditional painting techniques with the airbrush . The studio is therefore equipped with large exhaust fans , which remove fumes and spray from the work area , and both of them also use masks when airbrushing . Their processes usually involve blowing up and tracing a graphite sketch , and then cutting masks from the sketch . Then most of the work is airbrushed , with some details being made with sable brushes . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes into play . " It 's a delicate medium and it can get constrictive , " says Todd . " Often my assignments are fun , such as the box design for a Parker Brothers board game I 'm working on right now , but even when the images are really enjoyable for me to work with , they have to be made in a painstaking way . You have to have the right temperament for using the airbrush  --  the patience to cut stencils , the time to continue changing colors  --  and I 'm actually not sure that I want that in my own work . There , I need a more direct , spontaneous process , and I find traditional painting techniques allow for this . " <p> Although there are obvious similarities inherent in their work , the Schorrs operate first and foremost as individuals . Says Todd , " We always help each other out on projects , and when one of us needs some feedback or gets behind on meeting a deadline , the other is always there to pitch in . But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , creating a set of Pop Shots three-dimensional greeting cards ; I painted the background landscape and Kathy painted the figures . Quite often we get hired by the same clients , but always for separate assignments . It 's really important for us to work as individuals first . " Until recently they also had separate artist 's representatives . <p> In 1984 , the Schorrs moved to a house in Roxbury , Connecticut , which they had originally purchased as a summer home . " We were running a full studio in New York City , and we had lots of assistants , lots of deadlines , and lots of pressure . Eventually , it began to feel a little like a factory . It did n't have a very personal touch , " Todd explains . " I know it sounds like a cliche , but we both started to feel that our schedule seemed pointless  --  it was n't really leading anywhere . It seemed as if we just kept taking and doing more work to pay more bills , but we did n't have any time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own work . " The first year after they bought the house , they traveled back and forth from the city to the country , but they eventually decided to move out of the city altogether . Together they renovated the house , their most important project being the construction of a fifty-foot studio over the garage . " It 's the kind of place we 've always wanted , " he says . <p> Although he was initially concerned about the isolation of the country , Todd says that working with agencies and maintaining important connections has helped them sustain the high level of involvement in the commercial world that they had become accustomed to . " The technology available today  --  fax machines , telephones , Xerox machines , overnight mail  --  has made it all possible for us to be away from the city and still communicate instantaneously with our clients and meet our deadlines . We 're still only a few hours away from the city if anyone needs us , but I can only think of one instance in the past six years in which a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in person . The transition has been surprisingly easy . Of course , having an agent in the city has helped keep me connected . But I think right now it would be possible to conduct a successful business from a mountaintop somewhere with the correct technology . " Recently , both artists have pursued their personal , work , but these opportunities largely arise only when the schedule for their commercial assignments allows . <p> About five years ago ( about the time they left New York City ) , both Schorrs allowed themselves to become more serious about making their own paintings . Fortunately , their illustration work has paid well enough for them to choose their commercial assignments very carefully , as well as affording them the opportunity to do their own fine art Their personal work has quite a bit in common with their illustrations : The paintings are bold and expressive , incorporating the clean lines , vivid colors , and sense of fun that permeates much of the packaging and illustration they have created . Todd 's paintings , in fact , ire influenced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images from films and cartoons of the 1950s end ' 60s . <p> At the same time , however , the work is serious and sometimes harsh . Both artists are heavily influenced by what Todd refers to as art that has " an edge " to it . " We are n't just painting a bowl of fruit , a basket , of flowers , or a pretty , pastoral landscape . " he states . " The paintings reveal a view of the world that 's a bit more grim , like the paintings of some of the early German Expressionists . Our paintings also comment on social issues . " <p> The Schorrs dream of someday being able to afford to do exclusively their own personal work . This has also inspired them to begin a limited-edition print business , which they are currently getting off the ground . Their main objective is to eventually live off their fine-art work rather than , says Todd , " at the age of sixty to be worrying about deadlines or about where the next assignment will come from . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred for both of them a few years ago . In 1986 , both artists participated in a group show in Japan and , in conjunction with the exhibit , gave lectures on their work . They exhibited with a fascinating group that included Gary Panter , the artist responsible for the look and design of the children 's television program Pee Wee 's Play-house , Robert Williams , and Mark Mothersbaugh , a founding member of the rock group Devo . All these artists share the boldness and expressive qualities of the Schoor 's paintings . " Showing our work in Japan really solidified the work , as well as our identity with it , " says Todd . " The paintings went over well there . " <p> Last year , Todd also participated in a group show at the Tamara Bane Gallery in Los Angeles , California , which met with widespread interest . He relates that even before the gallery doors had been unlocked for the opening , there was a line all the way around the block , including such well-known collectors as the comedian Steve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more pieces in a group show there this coming fall . <p> " The work attracts the type of audience that likes pop culture , " says Todd . " It 's not the kind of imagery one usually sees in a gallery , so whoever sees the work has really got to enjoy the image . The sorts of people who buy our works are n't like sheep , buying whatever is known to be a valuable investment ; they really have to like the images they see " Of the acclaim they are receiving for their paintings , Todd says , " It 's not like being an overnight SoHo superstar , but we do have a strong following for our work . Our past three shows have all sold out completely . The work is being collected by younger people who like imagery , and who are willing to take a risk , just as we are .
