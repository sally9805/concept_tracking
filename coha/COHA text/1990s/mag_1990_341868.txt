Soon after the cable-television industry was deregulated in 1984 , critics began calling for new government controls . Many consumers wanted to curb fast- rising rates , while would-be cable competitors wanted authority to enter the business . Last week the House approved a bill that would empower the Federal Communications Commission to set rates for basic service and would require cable firms to lease channels to potential competitors at reasonable prices . But prospects for the bill are uncertain . The Senate is unlikely to complete the legislation before Congress adjourns Oct. 5 . Cable operators are generally unhappy with the House bill . But they would be even less enthusiastic about a Bush Administration proposal to allow telephone companies to provide cable service as well .
