Venus is the closest planet to Earth , and yet it retains an aura of mystery . The thick layer of clouds hiding its surface has long frustrated efforts to take a close look at the Venusian landscape . <P> Now the veil is coming off . Last week NASA 's Magellan spacecraft transmitted the most detailed pictures ever made of Earth 's next-door neighbor . The radar images revealed a tortured topography with fault-like cracks in surprisingly regular patterns , craters as big as greater Los Angeles and volcanic mountains flanked by congealed rivers of lava at least 320 km ( 200 miles ) long . Says James Head III , a Brown University geologist and member of the Magellan imaging team : " It 's a revolutionary new view of Venus . " <P> The revolution almost did n't happen . When Magellan first took up its elliptical orbit around Venus on Aug. 10 , its communications system inexplicably stopped working . Then the equipment started up , letting the space probe send back a few tantalizing images  --  and stopped once more . Fearful that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , which is responsible for Magellan , put the imaging on hold while they tracked down the problem . It was apparently a faulty computer chip . Electronic signals have been rerouted to bypass the flaw , and meanwhile Magellan 's control software is being entirely rewritten to make doubly sure there are no more lapses . <P> If the probe keeps working , scientists will by next summer have mapped some % 90% of the planet . Magellan 's radar detectors can pick up features as small as 120 meters ( 394 ft. ) across , 10 times smaller than anything ever seen before . That should be enough to begin answering some important questions about the geology and atmosphere of the planet . Although nearly the same size as Earth , Venus has an atmosphere thick with carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid . These gases have created an atmospheric pressure at the surface 90 times that of Earth and led to a greenhouse effect that keeps the temperature at 470 degrees C ( 900 degrees F ) , hot enough to melt lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is a plus for scientists . Without flowing liquids to cause erosion , the geological history of Venus has been preserved and can now be observed as if by time-lapse photography . For example , the outline of one mountain peak clearly shows how it was formed over time by three separate upward thrusts of the planet 's surface . The atmosphere preserves the land in another way as well : the clouds are so dense that all but the largest incoming meteorites burn up before striking the surface . Earth has absorbed far more hits from meteorites , although much of the evidence has eroded away . <P> Many scientists believe the Venusian volcanoes are still capable of erupting , and there is even a chance they may be caught in the act . After finishing a 243-day mapping mission , Magellan will start all over and do it again . Any change in the landscape that shows up in the second version  --  new lava or other debris , for example  --  would be strong evidence of volcanism , making Venus only the fourth body in the solar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neptune 's moon Triton , where eruptions have been spotted .
