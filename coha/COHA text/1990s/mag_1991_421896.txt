The spoils of development and industry imperil nearby national parks . <p> WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT created Saguaro National Monument in 1933 , it staked out two separate portions of prime Sonoran desert flanking the sleepy town of Tucson in southern Arizona . In all , Congress set aside more than 80,000 acres of scenic badlands , thick with dense forests of saguaro  --  the tall , sentinel-like cactus with arms angled to the sky in a spiny , enduring image of the American West . <p> At the time , Tucson was a city of 35,000 , its outermost limits 15 empty miles from the national monument . In the nearly 60 years since , Tucson has grown and prospered . New roads , homes , businesses , schools , parking lots , and golf courses have spread into the desert . Its population now 675,000 , Tucson has crept to within a mile of the monument 's border . Plans are under way for a resort community 50 feet from Saguaro 's eastern unit , and the city continues to grow 2.5 percent each year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change the national monument . Visitors accustomed to grand vistas may soon be confronted by horizons cluttered with condominiums and shopping centers . Wildlife , such as the mule deer , whose natural range extends beyond park bounds , will find highway traffic instead of tasty desert vegetation . Neighboring homeowners will likely bring nonnative plants and animals , which can creep into Saguaro , disrupting the balance that exists there . <p> The situation at Saguaro is just one manifestation of an enormous problem . The National Park Service is increasingly affected by actions outside park boundaries that may have a tremendous impact on areas it is mandated to preserve and protect . Threats range from the encroachment of urban sprawl to air and water pollution . They include oil , gas , and geothermal development , as well as clearcut logging and mining . <p> " All the indicators show that , as conflicts over precious resources intensify , problems are getting worse , not better , " said David Simon , NPCA 's natural resources program manager . <p> The most recent NPS survey of threats , published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affecting 198 parks . In a more extensive inquiry , the 1980 State of the Parks , NPS reported more than 2,170 threats facing the park system . " Many previously pristine areas today have become surrounded by an ever-growing array of incompatible and threatening activities on adjacent lands . " the earlier report concluded . <p> At the heart of the issue is the fact that the welfare of the national parks is inextricably linked to the lands around them . Plant communities can be forever disrupted by species imported from the manicured grounds of nearby resorts . Air currents and watercourses  --  a park 's lifeblood  --  an be tainted or interrupted by far-off dams or power plants . Logging or mining can bar park wildlife from age-old migration routes . <p> Saguaro 's case is typical of a national park near growing urban centers . Unlike more remote parks , which are often surrounded by public land , semi-urban areas are generally bordered by privately owned property . Disposition of public land is subject to some mandates or regulations , weak as these may be . Although NPCA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some legal authority over the development of adjacent private land , such development is usually left to the discretion of the landowner and a local zoning board . <p> With private land issues , park managers often fight for compromises , rather than ideal but unrealistic scenarios . Compromises do not always mean a chummy relationship with developers . According to Warren Brown , of NPS 's Planning Division , " The challenge is to decide when you can negotiate and when you ca n't , who holds the real power to control development , and what real choices are available . " <p> NPS officials have grown active at town meetings , lobbying zoning boards and appealing to the better nature of developers to build sensitively . But too often , local officials respond to the glitter of " economic development " held out by promoters . At Zion National Park , despite a storm of protest and NIPS opposition , the Town Council of Springdale , Utah , may approve a huge theater and shops at the park 's doorstep . Without legal clout to resist , NPS must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Florida , park officials persuaded the Burger King Corporation to reduce the scale of its international headquarters , built several years ago on the park 's northwest border . The company also agreed to landscape with native plants . <p> Biscayne 's 40-mile-long stretch of coastal wetlands and barrier islands on south Florida 's Atlantic shore had been buffered for years along much of the mainland border by miles of agricultural land . But as the city of Miami spread south , development intensified . <p> " They seem to be building continuously along the park boundary , " said Lane Landrum , Biscayne 's chief ranger . " We 're not sure which is more dangerous-agriculture or development . " <p> Within the park 's boundaries are 44 keys or islands that form a north-south chain with Biscayne Bay on the west and the Atlantic Ocean to the east . Park officials worry that wastes from residential communities will further pollute the bay , adding to the agricultural runoff of pesticides and herbicides . In addition , housing projects call for dredging and filling mangrove swamps on the park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development threatens even large , remote parks such as Glacier and Yellowstone . Stu Coleman , Yellowstone 's resource management specialist , considers a religious community on the park 's northern border its chief external threat . Since 1986 , followers of Church Universal and Triumphant ( CUT ) leader Elizabeth Clare Prophet have been settling the church 's headquarters , the Royal Teton Ranch . <p> " The church has taken a traditional cattle and haying operation and turned it into an intensive truck farm and orchard , " said Coleman . " They are just not compatible with a national park . " <p> The group has altered prune winter wildlife range and has constructed a six-foot jack-leg fence that impedes bison , elk , and , pronghorn antelope migration . The settlement 's numbers fluctuate between 800 and 1,000 people , while the largest neighboring community has a population of about 800 . <p> The popularity of Montana 's Glacier National Park creates its own kind of pressure . Mostly public lands surround the million-acre , mountainous park , but private owners hold 17,000 acres along the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These landowners are under increasing pressure from developers to subdivide and sell . Although traditional uses have maintained open space  --  preserving important habitat for deer , elk , moose , and grizzly bears  --  roads have been upgraded in the North Fork area , setting the stage for further development . <p> Private lands may be hard to control , but public lands present their own brand of trouble . Often federal agencies manage public lands surrounding big western parks . Around the country , national parks are encircled by logging , oil and gas exploration , drilling , mining , and proposals for geothermal development , all on federal land . Observers outside NPS suggest a number of reasons for this bureaucratic schizophrenia . A rivalry between NPS and other agencies has made cooperation difficult . Many parks originally were carved out of national forest land , which abuts much of the Park Service 's acreage in the West . This contributes to institutional tension . Further , NPS and other agencies represent rival factions of the conservation movement , preservation versus multiple use . <p> The high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the 1916 Organic Act was meant to preclude adjacent activities that degrade the parks , but this intention is often not heeded . The same government directed to " conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects , and the wild life " of the parks " unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations " also sanctions harmful activities . <p> According to William Lockhart , a law professor at the University of Utah and an expert in park legal issues , " a substantial portion of the most serious external threats arises from activities on other public lands , authorized or promoted by other federal agencies . " <p> In addition , legislation that could aid park protection remains untested . While many legal experts hold that the Organic Act gives park protection priority over other uses of federal land , insufficient case law exists to confirm the matter . Consequently , each administration carries out the mandate largely as it pleases . In the last decade , this has rendered the Interior Department a poor advocate for the national parks . <p> The majority of logging that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eliminates wildlife habitat , fragments other lands with access roads , and opens up remote areas to development . Exhausting the best stands in many areas , loggers push further up hillsides toward sites of marginal yield but greater ecological sensitivity . The movement of machinery , workers , and cut timber on slopes causes erosion , which can choke rivers . <p> Logging is a particular problem at Olympic National Park in Washington . About 300 miles of the park 's border abut timber-producing property . " A decade or so ago , logging was still remote from the park . But now , they 're cutting right up next to us , " said Paul Crawford , an Olympic official . <p> Oil and gas exploration and development also threaten the integrity of many parks , including Glacier . While drill sites are relatively small , activity takes place over many miles . Cenex , an oil and gas concern , now owns 13 oil and gas leases Covering thousands of acres of state and private land in the North Fork area . <p> " This area is really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lower 48 states , " said Lou Bruno of the Montana Wilderness Association . " If they are allowed to drill here , they can drill everywhere . " <p> Probably at no other national park area has oil and gas development progressed as far as at Theodore Roosevelt National Park in North Dakota . The park is at the southern end of the Williston Basin , an area rich in oil and gas deposits that stretches from northwest South Dakota into Canada . There are now more than 20 working sites within two miles of the park border , some as close as a few feet . Road and well-pad construction have displaced wildlife and intruded on the park 's serenity . Until electric motors can be installed , combustion engines drive the rigs day and night . The Forest Service has announced plans to lease for oil and natural gas drilling the 1.3 million acres of prairie and badlands that surround the national park . In a draft environmental impact statement ( EIS ) released in March , the Forest Service proposed leasing all of the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Service predicts 500 new oil and gas wells on these lands over the next ten years . <p> Geothermal drilling also causes conflict ; the wells could interfere with a park 's underground hydrological systems . The process taps pockets of highpressure steam embedded in the earth to generate power . About 100 applica-tions are pending to develop sites , on Yellowstone 's western border , in the Island Park area . <p> AnEIS released in 1980 stipulated that before drilling , developers must prove their activities will not harm the park 's geysers , hot springs , and other geothermal features . Since then , interest in development at Island Park has fallen off . Conservationists have urged the Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) , which controls subsurface resources on national forest land , to withdraw the area from geothermal development ; however , BLM refuses . <p> The bureau 's hesitance is typical . <p> Like the Forest Service , BLM operates under a mandate to provide for multiple use of the lands under its care . In The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem , a book soon to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writes that BLM rejects any duty to ensure that its resource development activities are compatible with adjacent parks . BLM asserts that it " does not manage public lands as buffer zones to the parks . " Instead , the bureau claims that the Organic Act does not address the administration of BLM public lands , whether or not they are near national parks . However , the agency ignores provisions in federal law and policy that could provide ample protection for the parks . The Interior Department 's official approach is compromise , instructing BLM and NPS to engage in " anticipation , avoidance , and resolution of such conflicts . " In the parks , this should involve a cooperative approach for managing land bound by a single ecosystem but under the jurisdiction of several agencies . Ecosystem management recognizes that watersheds , wildlife habitats , and other natural systems do not end at artificial boundaries . <p> While this approach often involves government managers , it can include private landowners . <p> Everglades National Park in Florida is a classic example of what can happen when ecosystem principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a shallow expanse of fresh water that flowed from central Florida 's Kissimmee River Basin to the Gulf of Mexico . Heavy summer rains inundated the rivers that flowed into the wetlands and supported its mangroves , wading birds , alligators , and Fells concolor , an indigenous species of panther . <p> Over the last 100 years , settlers have drained , diked , and channeled lands to the north of Everglades to irrigate farms and make way for developments . A system of canals , levees , floodgates , and pumps controlled the water 's flow to the park , interrupting its natural rhythm . Water that reached the park carried phosphorus and nitrates from agricultural runoff , and the seeds of nonnative plants . <p> By the early 1980s , Everglades was on the brink of ecological collapse . Wading-bird populations had declined by 90 percent ; cattails replaced native grasses at an alarming rate ; and the number of Florida panthers dropped to fewer than 40 , joining 15 other Everglades species on the threatened or endangered list . Recent developments , though , have created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acres of critical wetlands were added to the park . <p> New Florida governor Lawton Chiles has agreed to end a lawsuit with the federal government over the fate of the Everglades . The governor pledged to restructure the state 's water delivery system to more closely approximate natural flows and to restrict agricultural pollution . " This is the first indication that we can reduce the Everglades ' downward spiral , " said Pat Tolle , assistant superintendent at the park . <p> Threats to air quality , like water problems , often operate over large areas . Pollution generated in the San Joaquin Valley affects Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks in California . Agricultural , vehicular , and industrial sources emit sulfates , nitrates , ozone , and other pollutants that are carried into the valley to stay . <p> The eight counties that constitute the region consistently fail to meet national air quality standards . Air quality is especially bad in the summer when southeasterly winds laden with pollutants vent up park slopes . The effects of tainted air on the parks are still largely unknown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some trees . " The problem is that once we get to a point where we can see what 's going on , it 's almost too late , " said Diane Ewell , the park 's air quality specialist . <p> Existing rates of pollution already cloud the vistas at Shenandoah National Park in Virginia , and there are plans to build some 20 power plants throughout the state . Though most of these call for relatively small operations , their combined emissions could exacerbate air pollution at Shenandoah . The Interior Department has issued a determination that two of the individual plants would harm park resources , but park officials are urging the state to consider cumulative effects . <p> The inability or unwillingness to consider the effects as a whole applies to all external threats to the Park System . The ramifications of a small resort here and a new logging road there are debated individually rather than addressed on a system-wide basis . <p> NPS planners have an enormous challenge ahead of them as parks begin to feel the pinch of urban encroachment more and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development unfolded at Manassas National Battlefield Park in Virginia in 1988 . After receiving openended permits from county authorities , developers proposed a 1.2-millionsquare-foot shopping mall for a site next to the Civil War battlefield  --  a plan that threatened the site 's historic integrity . A coalition of conservationists , historians , and citizens nationwide sprang to Manassas ' defense . Congress blocked the project , but only through hasty acquisition of the property . Such costly remedies are not often available . <p> One quarter from which relief can and should be more forthcoming is the federal government . The Park Service 's sister agencies , especially those under Interior aegis , such as BLM , have the power to prevent harmful activities adjacent to the parks . <p> Through the practice of ecosystem management , NPS is striving to build a consensus for park protection . Strides have been made . Greater trust has been achieved among land-management agencies , and information flows more freely than it once did . <p> " However , coordinated ecosystem management is more a myth than a reality , " said NPCA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but agency behavior has yet to change . There is a vast gulf between the rhetoric of protecting parks and the reality of decision-making . " <p> Conflicts among agencies arise often enough to have provoked congressional debate . Since the early 1980s , several House and Senate bills have attempted to establish the primacy of park values in determining uses of public land . Though differing slightly in particulars , the bills would have given the Interior Secretary some recourse to avert actions deemed harmful to parks . None of the bills was enacted . <p> While federal statutes , such as the Organic Act , are available to NPS , political restraints prevent the agency from employing court action to seek relief from threats . Park officials are inclined to respect the jurisdictional turf of other agencies and are not eager to antagonize neighbors . Also at work , according to critics , is a lack of support from Interior . <p> In Our Common Lands , a 1988 NPCA book on safeguarding the parks , author Lockhart asserts that " the Interior Department weakens park protection by permitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park protection . " <p> Lockhart 's point is illustrated by Interior 's opposition to recent bills . Interior , through the Park Service , testified at Capitol Hill hearings that it had sufficient means to ensure protection and held that other agencies were already directed to weigh park values in decision-making . In practice , of course , the agency 's scales are consistently lopsided in favor of development . <p> In the bureaucratic wrangling , the parks retain an ace in the hole their great popularity with the public . The American people have demonstrated tremendous goodwill toward the national parks time and again when a danger was clear and present as it was at Manassas a few years ago . But the host of threats is not always so dear and often turns up in research result tables rather than front-page headlines . <p> It remains to be seen whether America can demonstrate the resolve needed to follow through on its commitment to preserve the parks unimpaired for future generations . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : A golf course invades the desert , replacing saguaro cacti with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( COLOR ) : Clearcut logging , which destroys wildlife habitat , has become an acute problem near Olympic National Park in Washington . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Roadways and other development bar wildlife , such as these elk at Yellowstone National Park , from migration routes . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : A mangrove sits high and dry in the once-water-rich Everglades National Park . <p> By John Kenney <p> <p> John Kenney , former news editor at National Parks , last wrote for the magazine about controlling park animals . <p>
