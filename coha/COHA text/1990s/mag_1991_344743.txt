When James Robinson III needs a little informal advice on how to polish the image of American Express , he has only to turn to his wife Linda . As president of the Manhattan p.r . firm Robinson , Lake , Lerer &; Montgomery , she ranks among the most powerful  --  and controversial  --  publicists in America . Her clients range from Texaco , which she helped to fend off a takeover bid staged by raider Carl Icahn , to junk-bond king Michael Milken , whose infamy she tried to % subdue . Together the Robinsons are a nonpareil power couple who cut a broad swath through the toniest boardrooms and ballrooms of the corporate elite . <P> Their marriage , the second for both , unites two overachievers whose days are so crowded that it takes his-and-her secretaries to get them together for lunch . Linda , 38 , the daughter of Freeman Gosden , who played Amos on the Amos and Andy show , was a deputy press secretary in Ronald Reagan 's first presidential campaign . A quick study , she had risen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a joint venture of Warner Communications and American Express , by the time she married Robinson in 1984 . Two years later she launched Robinson Lake , which has since been acquired by the giant advertising firm Bozell , Jacobs , Kenyon &; Eckhardt . <P> Robinson 's aggressive p.r . tactics have sometimes misfired . In the tangled fight for RJR Nabisco , she failed to soften the reckless bravado of client Ross Johnson in his abortive attempt to buy the food and tobacco company he headed . The defeat was a setback for her husband too . American Express 's Shearson Lehman unit had bankrolled Johnson , and Jim Robinson had worked closely on the deal . More recently , she sought to portray Milken as a misunderstood benefactor of the poor . But the campaign had little impact on perceptions of the junk man , who is serving a 10-year sentence for violating securities laws . <P> Despite their evident mutual admiration and shared passion for business , the Robinsons remain a bit of an odd couple in the eyes of some observers . " Linda 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a former investment banker . " I just do n't think Jimmy 's cut out for that . He is a man perfectly fitted to have been Eisenhower 's Secretary of the Treasury . " <P> Jim Robinson 's drive and determination have never been in doubt . A dedicated weight lifter who bulked up from 125 lbs . to more than 200 lbs . in college , he rises at dawn and begins each day with a workout , sometimes following along with a video called Buns of Steel . ( Robinson 's exercise routine has become the stuff of legend . Business Week reported three years ago that he did 300 sit- ups each morning ; FORTUNE said at least 600 in a 1989 story ; Vanity Fair put the number last year at 900 . ) <P> The scion of an Atlanta banking family , Robinson , 55 , maintains a courtly manner and has donned the mantle of corporate elder statesman by frequently testifying before Congress and speaking out on pet issues like the benefits of free trade . Chairman since 1977 , he has managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems , which has earned him a reputation as a Teflon-coated executive .
