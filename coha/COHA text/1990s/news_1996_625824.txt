<p> It visits us once a year or so , usually around the holidays , usually just to say hello . <p> We turn on the TV and there it is , in grainy film , this old acquaintance known as the Ice Bowl . <p> The Green Bay Packers and Dallas Cowboys . The 1967 NFL championship game played in temperatures of 13-19 below zero . <p> On a sheet of ice at Green Bay 's Lambeau Field . <p> Bart Starr of the Packers running a one-foot quarterback sneak behind Jerry Kramer . Scoring the winning touchdown with 13 seconds remaining . A 21-17 Packer victory . Legendary coach Vince Lombardi shaking his fist in rare glee . <p> The wonderful aura of men trying to play football while blowing steam and chipping the ice off the ground with their cleats . The birth of the legendary phrase , frozen tundra . <p> Like an old acquaintance , we embrace the Ice Bowl every year and think we know it . <p> But like many old acquaintances , we do n't . Not really . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a championship game for the first time since that infamous New Year 's Eve of 28 years ago - they play today in Irving - the legend needs a little de-icing . <p> That quarterback sneak ? <p> It was not a quarterback sneak . The play called for Starr to hand the ball to running back Chuck Mercein . Some Packers still do n't know why he decided to keep it . <p> Jerry Kramer ? <p> He did n't make the main block alone , as is customarily described . It was a double-team effort led by center Ken Bowman , who is still not happy that Kramer made a career out of taking all the credit . <p> Parties from both sides agree that Kramer 's biggest contribution to history was that he jumped offside on the play , but it was never called . <p> The winning score ? <p> It was actually made on the previous play , by running back Donny Anderson on a plunge that both Packers and Cowboys agree moved the ball across the goal line . <p> Anderson still wonders if his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not knocked it out of his hands and forced him to tuck it back on the other side of the goal line after the play was ruled dead . <p> Genius Vince Lombardi ? <p> He might have shut off the field 's $ 80,000 heating system to cause the field to freeze in the first place . <p> And really , now , what was a genius doing trying to win a title game on a running play with no timeouts. . . when a field goal would have tied it ? <p> If Starr does n't score , the Cowboys win and NFL history dramatically changes . If Lombardi calls that play today , he gets ripped from here to Howie Long . <p> Wonderful aura ? <p> Here 's your aura . The pregame and halftime marching-band shows were canceled when an official noticed blood on some of the musician 's faces . <p> It was so cold , their lips had stuck to the mouthpieces of their instruments , and then split when removed . <p> Frozen tundra ? <p> John Facenda , the late NFL Films @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , used hundreds of phrases when describing Green Bay 's field . <p> " " Frozen tundra " was not one of them . <p> He never said it . <p> Nobody has any idea who did . <p> Now for the rest of the Ice Bowl story : <p> THE SETTING <p> The Packers and Cowboys were playing for the NFL championship for a second consecutive year . The winner would go to the Super Bowl . <p> The Packers had won their previous title matchup in Dallas 34-27 in a game that was considered a better contest than the Ice Bowl . <p> In the final moments in the Cotton Bowl , the Packers intercepted a pass in the end zone after Cowboy quarterback Don Meredith had been knocked askew . <p> The intercepting safety was Tom Brown , the rushing linebacker Dave Robinson . <p> THE MOTIVATION <p> The Cowboys were seeking their first championship since joining the league in 1960 . <p> Lombardi , whose team had won the NFL championship in 1965 and the inaugural Super Bowl title after the 1966 season , was hoping to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " " He talked about that , " said Bowman . " " He wanted it bad . " <p> So bad that he began screaming at CBS cameras to leave the sidelines - " " This is my office . Get outta here ! " he reportedly shouted - even though the network had scheduled a live 30-minute pregame show of player interviews . <p> Perhaps this is also why the Ice Bowl is known as the day Pat Summerall coined the word " " filler . " <p> THE WAKE-UP CALL <p> " " Good morning , Mr. Rentzel . It 's 8 a.m It 's 15 below zero and there 's a 20-mph wind coming out of the northwest . Have a nice day . " <p> This was the wake-up call from the Holiday Inn operator as heard by Cowboy receiver Lance Rentzel the morning of the game . <p> PREGAME RITUAL <p> The door of Cowboy John Niland 's hotel room was frozen shut . <p> He could not board the team bus until a hotel worker broke it down . <p> SERIOUS PREGAME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field , some of them removed the hard-rubber tips from their cleats and played with the sharp metal exposed , hoping it would cut through the ice . <p> THE FROZEN ZEBRA The pea in referee Norm Schachter 's whistle froze before the opening kickoff . <p> Official Joe Connell 's lip split after he 'd blown his whistle immediately after the opening kickoff . <p> So Schachter announced that no whistles be used . <p> For the rest of the game , referees stopped play by shouting , " " He 's down . " or " " Hold up . " <p> THE HEROES The telecast of the game has the sounds of excitement that will live forever because Summerall and partner Ray Scott insisted on announcing the action through an open press box window . <p> THE WIMP ? <p> Bob Hayes , the Cowboy star receiver , ran his routes with his hands in his pants . <p> He had only three catches for 16 yards - none after halftime - and has spent the last 28 years defending himself against the scorn of players from both sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge after their third possession , thanks to touchdown passes of eight and 43 yards from Starr to Boyd Dowler . <p> " " I know one thing , " Dowler told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram . <p> " " If I would have tried running patterns with my hands in my pants , that Italian coach of mine would have yanked me out of there so fast , and I would have been history . " <p> THE GLOVES Ernie Stautner , Cowboy assistant , ordered the defensive players not wear gloves so they could better grab fumbles and intercept passes . <p> After a few series , defensive end Willie Townes saw the effectiveness of the gloved Packer defenders and made a decision . <p> " " I said , ' The hell with it . I 'm getting gloves and keeping my hands warm , ' " he said . <p> Shortly thereafter , he hit Starr and forced a fumble that George Andrie ran seven yards into the end zone for a touchdown . <p> Moments after that , Willie Wood fumbled a Cowboy punt and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Villanueva that gave the Packers a 14-10 halftime lead . <p> THE FANS Throughout the game , the Packer fans in the front row leaned over the railing and pulled the plug on the Cowboys ' heated benches . <p> THE PAYBACK <p> Bar owners throughout Green Bay told stories of fans who would walk into their establishments after the game , warm up , then promptly pass out . <p> The fans were reportedly finally feeling the effect of gallons of brandy and peppermint schnapps that were passed through the bleachers . Because of the cold , they were unaffected by the alcohol until their systems had thawed . <p> THE TIP-OFF <p> Some Packer defenders must still wonder why they did n't notice Cowboy running back Dan Reeves put his hands in his pants before a fourth-quarter play near midfield , with the Packers still leading , 14-10 . <p> It turns out , Reeves was preparing to pull up after hand-off and throw a 50-yard pass to Rentzel . It worked . Rentzel scored , giving the Cowboys a 17-14 lead . <p> By then , the temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Packers missed a field goal with 9:44 remaining , and the Cowboys thought the game was over . <p> " " But they did n't know coach Lombardi , " said Packer running back Anderson . " " What happened at the end of that game was exactly what coach Lombardi was all about . " <p> THE PITS <p> Anderson tried to keep his hands warm on the field by sticking them in the armpits of guard Gale Gillingham . <p> THE TECHNOLOGY <p> The Cowboys tried to keep warm by wearing garbage bags under their jerseys . <p> THE DRIVE <p> With 4:50 left in the game , the Packers took over the ball at their 32-yard line . <p> On their previous 10 possessions , the Packers had been unable to move the ball more than 14 yards . <p> In the next five minutes , they advanced five times that far . <p> " " Bart said , ' OK guys , let 's go to work . Let 's get it done . ' " Anderson said . " " Then for the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling the plays . <p> " " Nobody had to say anything because nine years of Vince Lombardi was in that huddle with us . " <p> THE BULL Another trivia question : Who gained 27 of the final 30 yards of the drive , with 19 He was a 225-pound rookie running back from Yale , acquired a few months earlier from the semipro Westchester ( N.Y. ) Bulls . <p> The reason he was suddenly used ? He was so heavy and slow , Starr correctly figured he was their only ballcarrier who would n't slip . <p> THE FIRST SCORE <p> On his second of two plunges from the one-yard line , Anderson crossed the goal line . This has been confirmed by both Cowboys and Packers in the vicinity . <p> He wonders what would have happened if Jordan had not knocked the ball loose after he had scored , if he could have slipped further past the line before the official found him . <p> Although Anderson earned two Super Bowl rings and a Pro Bowl invitation in his football career , and although he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life would have changed . <p> " " For about the last , what , 30 years , for one hour a day around Super Bowl time , the whole world sees Bart Starr score , " Anderson said . " " Who knows . Maybe Donny Anderson would have been a bigger star if he was the one who had scored . " <p> But he shrugs the ghosts away . <p> " " You know , Bart Starr was Mr. Green Bay , " he said . " " He was meant to score that ball . " <p> THE OFFSIDE <p> Jethro Pugh , the man blocked on the Starr 's winning score , has been claiming it for years . <p> Bowman , who was snapping the ball , now confirms it . <p> Kramer was offside on the play . <p> " " Jerry was real quick off the ball , " he said . " " I remember snapping the ball and he was gone . " <p> THE GLORY HOG The blocking pattern on the winning play was known as a " " post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knocked him back , paving the way for Starr . <p> And this is how the winning run would have been described to the world , except for something Kramer said to Bowman as he laid a hand on the youngster 's shoulder before the postgame interview session . <p> " " He said , ' Kenny , let an old man have his moment in the spotlight . You have 10 more years to be here , ' " Bowman said . <p> " " I was so young and dumb , I believed him . I believed I would make another block and be involved in a big play like this again . " <p> Today , as a generally anonymous public defender in Tucson , Ariz. , watching Kramer reap the rewards of being a famous author and Packer hero , Bowman sometimes wonders . <p> " " I never realized that I would never make another block like that , " he said . " " And I never realized that that would be the play of the century . " <p> THE PAYOFF For their game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Packers made $ 7,951 . <p> For that , they suffered through frostbite , at least one broken bone , and generally the worst afternoon of their lives . <p> THE QUOTE <p> " " Cold ? What cold ? I did n't notice any cold . " - Vince Lombardi . <p> TYPE : SPECIAL REPORT
