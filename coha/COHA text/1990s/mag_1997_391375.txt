Makeup artist Laura Mercier made over Madonna for Evita ; now she 's transformed her New York City pad from citified town house to French country farmhouse .

" I wanted something with European charm but wound up living in everything from a studio infested with cockroaches and mice to a supernoisy high-rise in midtown Manhattan , " she recalls . Laura 's luck changed eight years ago when she was shown a sevenroom , four-story 18th-century brownstone in the Chelsea area of Manhattan . Not only was the house an oasis of calm ( without any uninvited furry friends ) , but it was filled with typical French details : soaring ceilings , decoritive moldings , original old fireplaces , and the beautiful parquet floors that Laura uncovered beneath the wall-to-wall carpeting .

In Laura 's bedroom , crispy white linens dress a canopy-framed bed flanked by two country side tables and an old-fashioned washbowl and pitcher . While Laura 's ultimate dream is to live in a castle ( " I 've been obsessed with them since childhood , " she says ) , for the moment she is content with her New York brownstone .
