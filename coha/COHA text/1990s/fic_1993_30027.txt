1 Golden light poured over the little town of Crozet , Virginia . Mary Minor Haristeen looked up from the envelopes she was sorting and then walked over to the large glass window to admire the view . It seemed to her as if the entire town had been drenched in butter . The rooftops shone ; the simple clapboard buildings were lent a pleasing grace . Harry was so compelled by the quality of the light that she threw on her denim jacket and walked out the back door . Mrs. Murphy , Harry 's tiger cat , and Tee Tucker , her corgi , roused themselves from a drowsy afternoon slumber to accompany her . The long October rays of the sun gilded the large trotting-horse weathervane on Miranda Hogendobber 's house on St. George Avenue , seen from the alleyway behind the post office . Brilliant fall days brought back memories of hotly contested football games , school crushes , and cool nights . Much as Harry loathed cold weather , she liked having to buy a new sweater or two . At Crozet High @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , in 1973 to be exact , and caught the eye of Fair Haristeen . Oak trees transformed into orange torches , the maples turned blood-red , and the beech trees became yellow , then as now . Autumn colors remained in her memory , and this would be that kind of fall . Her divorce from Fair had been final six months ago , or was it a year ? She really could n't remember , or perhaps she did n't want to remember . Her friends ransacked their address books for the names of eligible bachelors . There were two : Dr. Larry Johnson , the retired , widowed town doctor , who was two years older than God , and the other , of course , was Pharamond Haristeen . Even if she wanted Fair back , which shemost certainly did not , he was embroiled in a romance with BoomBoom Craycroft , the beautiful thirty-two-year-old widow of Kelly Craycroft . Harry mused that everyone in town had nicknames . Olivia was BoomBoom , and Pharamond was Fair . She was Harry , and Peter Shiflett , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cabell Hall , president of the Allied National Bank in Richmond , was Cab or Cabby ; his wife of twenty-seven years , Florence , was dubbed Taxi . The Marilyn Sanburnes , senior and junior , were Big Marilyn , or Mim , and Little Marilyn respectively . How close it made everyone feel , these little monikers , these tokens of intimacy , nicknames . Crozet folks laughed at their neighbors ' habits , predicting who would say what to whom and when . These were the joys of a small town , yet they masked the same problems and pain , the same cruelties , injustice , and self-destructive behavior found on a larger scale in Charlottesville , fourteen miles to the east , or Richmond , seventy miles beyond Charlottesville . The veneer of civilization , so essential to daily life , could easily be dissolved by crisis . Sometimes it did n't even take a crisis : Dad came home drunk and beat the living shit out of his wife and children , or a husband arrived home early from work to his heavily mortgaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , it could n't happen in Crozet but it did . Harry knew it did . After all , a post office is the nerve center of any community and she knew , usually before others , what went on when the doors were closed and the lights switched off . A flurry of legal letters might cram a box , or a strange medley of dental bills , and as Harry sorted the mail she would piece together the stories hidden from view . If Harry understood her animals better , then she 'd know even more , because her corgi , Tee Tucker , could scurry under porch steps , and Mrs. Murphy could leap into a hayloft , a feat the agile tiger cat performed both elegantly and with ease . The cat and dog carried a wealth of information , if only they could impart it to their relatively intelligent human companion . It was never easy , though . Mrs. Murphy sometimes had to roll over in front of her mother , or Tee Tucker might have to grab her pants leg . Today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind . They sat next to Harry and observed Miranda Hogendobber -- clad in a red plaid skirt , yellow sweater , and gardening gloves -- hoe her small patch , which was producing a riot of squash and pumpkins . Harry waved to Mrs. Hogendobber , who returned the acknowledgment . " Harry , " Susan Tucker , Harry 's best friend , called from inside the post office . " I 'm out back . " Susan opened the back door . " Postcard material . Picture perfect . Fall in central Virginia . " As she spoke the back door of the market opened and Pewter , the Shifletts ' fat gray cat , streaked out , a chicken leg in her mouth . Market shouted after the cat , " Damn you , Pewter , you 'll get no supper tonight . " He started after her as she headed toward the post office , glanced up , and beheld Harry and Susan . " Excuse me , ladies , had I known you were present I would not have used foul language . " Harry laughed . " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to share ? " Mrs. Murphy inquired of Pewter as she shot past them . " How can she answer ? Her mouth is full , " Tucker said . " Besides , when have you known Pewter to give even a morsel of food to anybody else ? " " That 's a fact . " Mrs. Murphy followed her gray friend , just in case . Pewter stopped just out of reach of a subdued Market , now chatting up the ladies . She tore off a tantalizing hunk of chicken . " How 'd you get that away from Market ? " Mrs. Murphy 's golden eyes widened . Ever ready to brag , Pewter chewed , yet kept a paw on the drumstick . " He put one of those barbecued chickens up on the counter . Little Marilyn asked him to cut it up and when his back was turned I made off with a drumstick . " She chewed another savory piece . " Are n't you a clever girl ? " Tucker sniffed that delicious smell . " As a matter of fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't take a chicken that a cat had bitten into , and truthfully , I would n't eat anything Little Marilyn had touched . Turning into as big a snot as her mother . " With lightning speed Mrs. Murphy grabbed the chicken leg as Tucker knocked the fat kitty off balance . Mrs. Murphy raced down the alleyway into Miranda Hogendobber 's garden , followed by a triumphant Tucker and a spitting Pewter . " Give me that back , you striped asshole ! " " You never share , Pewter , " Tucker said as Mrs. Murphy ran between the rows of cornstalks , moving toward the moonlike pumpkins . " Harry , " Mrs. Hogendobber bellowed , " these creatures will be the death of me yet . " She brandished her hoe in the direction of Tucker , who ran away . Now Pewter chased Mrs. Murphy up and down the rows of squash but Mrs. Murphy , nimble and fit , leapt over a wide , spreading squash plant with its creamy yellow bounty in the middle . She headed for the pumpkins . Market laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He was referring to Little Marilyn and her equally distasteful maternal unit , Mim . That made Susan and Harry laugh , which infuriated Mrs. Hogendobber because she thought they were laughing at her . " It 's not funny . They 'll ruin my garden . My prize pumpkins . You know I 'm going to win at the Harvest Fair with my pumpkins . " Miranda 's face turned puce . " I 've never seen that color on a human being before . " Tucker stared up in wonderment . " Tucker , watch out for the hoe , " Mrs. Murphy yelled . She dropped the drumstick . Pewter grabbed it . The fat swung under her belly as she shot back toward home , came within a whisker 's length of Market and skidded sideways , evading him . He laughed . " If they want it that bad I might as well bring over the rest of the chicken . " By the time he was back with the chicken , Mrs. Hogendobber , huffing and puffing , had plopped herself at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have broken my hip . What if she 'd knocked me over ? " Mrs. Hogendobber warmed to the scenario of damage and danger . Market bit his tongue . He wanted to say that she was well padded enough not to worry . Instead he clucked sympathy while cutting meat off the chicken for the three animals , who hastily forgave one another any wrongdoing . Chicken was too important to let ego stand in the way . " I 'm sorry , Mrs. Hogendobber . Are you all right ? " Harry asked politely . " Of course I 'm all right . I just wish you could control your charges . " " What you need is a corgi , " Susan Tucker volunteered . " No , I do n't . I took care of my husband all my life and I do n't need a dog to care for . At least George brought home a paycheck , bless his soul . " " They 're very entertaining , " Harry added . " What about the fleas ? " Mrs. Hogendobber was more interested than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a dog , " Harry answered . " I do not have fleas . " " Miranda , when the weather 's warm , everyone 's got fleas , " Market corrected her . " Speak for yourself . And if I ran a food establishment I would make sure there was n't a flea within fifty yards of the place . Fifty yards . " Mrs. Hogendobber pursed her lips , outlined in a pearlized red that matched the red in her plaid skirt . " And I 'd give more discounts . " " Now , Miranda . " Market , having heard this ad nauseam , was prepared to launch into a passionate defense of his pricing practices . An unfamiliar voice cut off this useless debate . " Anyone home ? " " Who 's that ? " Mrs. Hogendobber 's eyebrows arched upward . Harry and Susan shrugged . Miranda marched into the post office . As her husband , George , had been postmaster for over forty years before his death , she felt she could do whatever she wanted . Harry was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The animals , finished with the chicken , scooted in . Standing on the other side of the counter was the handsomest man Mrs. Hogendobber had seen since Clark Gable . Susan and Harry might have chosen a more recent ideal of virility , but whatever the vintage of comparison , this guy was drop-dead gorgeous . Soft hazel eyes illuminated a chiseled face , rugged yet sensitive , and his hair was curly brown , perfectly cut . His hands were strong . Indeed , his entire impression was one of strength . On top of well-fitted jeans was a watermelon-colored sweater , the sleeves pushed up on tanned , muscular forearms . For a moment no one said a word . Miranda quickly punctured the silence . " Miranda Hogendobber . " She held out her hand . " Blair Bainbridge . Please call me Blair . " Miranda now had the upper hand and could introduce the others . " This is our postmistress , Mary Minor Haristeen . Susan Tucker , wife of Ned Tucker , a very fine lawyer should you ever need one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is very convenient and carries those sinful Dove bars . " " Hey , hey , what about us ? " The chorus came from below . Harry picked up Mrs. Murphy . " This is Mrs. Murphy , that 's Tee Tucker , and the gray kitty is Pewter , Market 's invaluable assistant , though she 's often over here picking up the mail . " Blair smiled and shook Mrs. Murphy 's paw , which delighted Harry . Mrs. Murphy did n't mind . The masculine vision then leaned over and patted Pewter 's head . Tucker held up her paw to shake , which Blair did . " I 'm pleased to meet you . " " Me , too , " Tucker replied . " May I help you ? " Harry asked as the others leaned forward in anticipation . " Yes . I 'd like a post box if one is available . " " I have a few . Do you like odd numbers or even ? " Harry smiled . She could be charming when she smiled . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself . What you saw was what you got . " Even . " " How does forty-four sound ? Or thirteen -- I almost forgot I had thirteen . " " Do n't take thirteen . " Miranda shook her head . " Bad luck . " " Forty-four then . " " Thirty-four ninety-five , please . " Harry filled out the box slip and stamped it with pokeberry-colored ink , a kind of runny maroon . He handed over the check and she handed over the key . " Is there a Mrs. Bainbridge ? " Mrs. Hogendobber brazenly asked . " The name sounds so familiar . " Market rolled his eyes heavenward . " No , I have n't had the good fortune to find the right woman to --  " " Harry 's single , you know . Divorced , actually . " Mrs. Hogendobber nodded in Harry 's direction . At that moment Harry and Susan would have gladly slit her throat . " Mrs. Hogendobber , I 'm sure Mr. Bainbridge does n't need my biography on his first visit to the post office . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He put the key in his pocket , smiled , and left , climbing into a jet-black Ford F350 dually pickup . Mr. Bainbridge was prepared to do some serious hauling in that baby . " Miranda , how could you ? " Susan exclaimed . " How could I what ? " " You know what . " Market took up the chorus . Miranda paused . " Mention Harry 's marital status ? Listen , I 'm older than any of you . First impressions are important . He might not have such a good first impression of me but I bet he 'll have one of Harry , who handled the situation with her customary tact and humor . And when he goes home tonight he 'll know there 's one pretty unmarried woman in Crozet . " With that astonishing justification she swept out the back door . " Well , I 'll be damned . " Market 's jaw hung slack . " That 's what I say . " Pewter cackled . " Girls , I 'm going back to work . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and opened the front door . He paused . " Oh , come on , you little crook . " Pewter meowed sweetly and followed her father out the door . " Can you believe Rotunda could run that fast ? " Tucker said to Mrs. Murphy . " That was a surprise . " Mrs. Murphy rolled over on the floor , revealing her pretty buff underbelly . " This fall is going to be full of surprises . I feel it in my bones . " Tucker smiled and wagged her stumpy tail . Mrs. Murphy gave her a look . The cat was not in the mood for prophecy . Anyway , cats knew more of such things than dogs . She did n't feel like confirming that she thought Tucker was right . Something was in the air . But what ? Harry placed the check in the drawer under the counter . It was face up and she peered down at it again . " Yellow Mountain Farm . " " There is no Yellow Mountain Farm . " Susan bent over to examine the check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been empty for over a year now . Who would buy it ? " " A Yankee . " Harry closed the door . " Or someone from California . " " No . " Susan 's voice dropped . " There is nothing else for sale around Yellow Mountain except Foxden . " " But , Harry , we know everything , and we have n't heard one word , one measly peep , about Foxden selling . " Harry was already dialing the phone as Susan was talking . " Jane Fogleman , please . " There was a brief pause . " Jane , why did n't you tell me Foxden had sold ? " Jane , from the other end of the line , replied , " Because we were instructed to keep our mouths shut until the closing , which was at nine this morning at McGuire , Woods , Battle and Boothe.
