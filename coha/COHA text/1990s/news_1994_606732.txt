<p> Daniel Jernigan was sitting through an afternoon lecture on press relations last month at the headquarters of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention here , when he was tapped on the shoulder . The respiratory disease specialist who had just begun his training for the CDC 's Epidemic Intelligence Service was already needed for a high-stakes , high-profile investigation . <p> At 11 p.m. on July 15 , CDC officials dispatched Jernigan to board the luxury cruise ship Horizon in New York harbor . Twelve hundred passengers were waiting to disembark . Twelve hundred more were eager to board . It was Jernigan 's job to determine whether  --  as officials suspected  --  the Horizon had become the first seagoing reservoir of Legionnaires ' disease . <p> Jernigan is no expert in Legionnaires ' , and this was his first investigation into an outbreak of an acute infectious illness . <p> But his mission typifies the Epidemic Intelligence Service ( EIS ) , a training program widely regarded by those in public health and academia as a breeding ground for some of the best  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Jernigan said that such emergencies are precisely " why I came to CDC  --  the whole notion of doing an outbreak , not knowing what 's going on and figuring it out so that you can intervene to stop transmission of the disease . " <p> Many of CDC 's toughest investigations have been carried out by EIS officers thrown into the field with close supervision but little or no prior experience . EIS officers reported the first cases of AIDS , which had not yet been named , and solved the riddle of toxic shock syndrome . They have investigated the contamination of killed poliovirus vaccine with live virus , deaths linked to intrauterine contraceptive devices , health effects of the Three Mile Island emergency and the link between aspirin and Reye 's syndrome . <p> Underlying the program , says EIS chief Polly Marchbanks , are two axioms : " Diseases do not occur at random " and " Diseases can be prevented . " <p> She said the program is designed to teach applied epidemiology , which is intended to supply information that health officials and policymakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> For the epidemiologist , she said , " the patient is the community . " To care for this patient , disease detectives look for patterns in outbreaks of illness . They try to determine " who " became sick , " where " an individual might have been exposed to an illness and " when " the exposure might have taken place . Any pattern may yield useful clues . <p> Each class of 65 EIS officers is chosen from a pool of more than 300 applicants from around the world . Although most of the recruits in the early days of EIS were physicians , that is changing . About half of the recruits in recent classes have doctorates in epidemiology , a shift reflecting the agency 's growing emphasis on the prevention of noninfectious health problems , such as violence and chronic disease . But other fields are represented as well , including nurses and veterinarians interested in diseases communicated from animals to humans . <p> EIS officers learn to use the classic tools of epidemiology , including odds ratios , which measure the increased risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare patients with non-patients to determine whether the individuals who developed a disease shared a common exposure to a germ or toxin . <p> The training lectures , offered in the annual three-week introductory course last month for the class of 1994 EIS recruits , provide a sweeping introduction to the human , statistical and public-relations skills that go into the making of a disease detective . Small group sessions , most of which present case studies of prior epidemics , enable trainees to apply what they 've learned to real-world problems . Consider three case studies offered this year : <p> It is Oct. 27 , 1975 . Within three days , 31,900 Kampuchean refugees have fled Vietnamese troops and filled a camp at Sakaeo . Many are starving or wounded . Children are dying . Your assignment is to find the dimensions of the problem . The proper response would be to set up a surveillance system relying on medical , lab and burial records to determine the principal causes of death and severe illness so that relief agencies could take action to stop the suffering . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epidemiologist awaiting the arrival of the newly developed AIDS tests at blood banks in your state . The test will screen out 95 percent of infected blood but will also yield high numbers of false positive readings . Do you notify test-positive blood donors of their results ? The appropriate decision : not necessarily . They may not be infected , and a confirmatory test has not yet been developed . <p> It is June 16 , 1985 . A thyroid specialist reports seven cases of thyrotoxicosis , a type of poisoning caused by excess thyroid hormone . A case-control study found all had eaten beef from a certain processing plant . What do you do next ? Study the plant 's practices and discover that the company 's method of " gulleting " cows during cleaning leaves thyroid tissue in the meat . Notify the U.S. Department of Agriculture , which bans the practice . <p> Despite CDC 's reputation for turning out leading epidemiologists , the training program is not without critics . <p> " Someone who has been trained primarily in dealing with infectious diseases may not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alvin Feinstein , professor of medicine and epidemiology at Yale University . " There is just a mammoth amount of epidemiology that does not deal with infectious disease . " <p> Some non-physician EIS officers echoed that concern , saying that they expect to spend their careers not tracking outbreaks but instead using statistics from large populations to tease out hidden links between risk factors such as smoking and chronic ailments such as heart disease and diabetes . <p> Marchbanks countered that although the roots of EIS and CDC are in infectious diseases , " over time that has shifted and CDC has begun to address public health problems of all types . " The agency has broadened its requirement that EIS officers respond to an infectious disease outbreak as part of their training to cover any serious health threat " requiring a rapid public health response , " whether it be a toxic spill or the Los Angeles riots , she said . <p> CDC surveys have shown that as many as 3,500 disease outbreaks occur in the United States each year . State health departments ask for CDC 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did in the Horizon incident . <p> The CDC investigation began when an official of the New Jersey Department of Health called CDC officials to report several cases of what appeared to be Legionnaires ' in several local hospitals . All of the sufferers had been passengers on the Horizon . <p> CDC officials needed an investigator , and they turned to Jernigan . Robert F. Breiman , CDC 's chief of respiratory disease epidemiology and a veteran of many outbreak investigations , pulled him out of class . <p> In the Horizon investigation , Jernigan was supervised by Breiman and epidemiologist Martin Cetron and accompanied by Jo Hofmann , who is entering the second year of the two-year program and has investigated other airborne-disease outbreaks . <p> By about 11 p.m . Jernigan and Hofmann were en route to New York . They lugged two coolers , filled with diagnostic supplies and the equipment they would need to sample the ship 's water system for evidence of the Legionella bacterium . <p> By morning , Jernigan and Hofmann had collected questionnaires eliciting information from the passengers about their health , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' disease . <p> CDC officials decided that the evidence in the case was not substantial enough to ask the Horizon to postpone or cancel its scheduled 4 p.m. departure for Bermuda . And quarantining former passengers would not help , because Legionnaires ' disease does not spread from person to person . <p> That morning a new crop of passengers boarded and the ship sailed , with Jernigan and Hofmann on board . Later lab tests disclosed traces of the Legionnaires ' bacterium in the ship 's water system , and the passengers were asked to leave the ship in Bermuda . The ship purged its tanks of the bacterium , but cases from prior cruises continue to emerge . Even though Jernigan lost a week of class , he found the investigation " a whole lot more interesting than the course . Everybody sitting in that room wants to go out on an outbreak . " <p> Breiman 's decision to send him into the vortex of an epidemic would likely have drawn an approving nod from Alexander Langmuir , who founded the EIS program in the 1950s as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Langmuir , who died this year , once described the EIS training philosophy this way : " We throw them overboard , see if they can swim , and if they ca n't , throw them a life ring , pull them out and throw them in again .
