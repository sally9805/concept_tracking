<p> This summer , traveling no farther south than Santa Cruz , east than Orinda and north than San Rafael , a Bay Area Shakespeare fan could have caught the following : a cross-dressed production of " The Merchant of Venice , " " The Merry Wives of Windsor " set in a 1970s trailer court , " The Comedy of Errors " played out on California 's Venice Beach , " A Midsummer Night 's Dream " featuring acrobats and clowns from the New Pickle Circus and a chamber version of " King Lear " bristling with switchblades and a hip-hop score . And that was n't all . <p> The region 's annual alfresco summer Shakespeare feed has included two major productions of " The Taming of the Shrew "  --  the peripatetic San Francisco Shakespeare Festival show is encamped at Golden Gate Park through October 2 , and the California Shakespeare Festival 's " Shrew " opened Friday in Orinda . There was a " Romeo and Juliet " at CSF 's Orinda amphitheater and another at a Napa Valley winery , a major " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous for even the most indefatigable theatergoer to visit . <p> Add a trip north to Ashland 's Oregon Shakespeare Festival , as many residents here do , and the 1994 Bardic register expands to include the rarely seen " Two Noble Kinsmen " ( attributed to Shakespeare and John Fletcher ) , outdoor productions of " The Tempest " and " Much Ado About Nothing " and a postmodern staging of " Hamlet " that will complete an eight-month run at the Angus Bowmer Theatre at the end of October . <p> Northern California , with Ashland by extension , may well be the Shakespeare capital of North America . Audiences in other major cities around the country often go a year or more without seeing any Shakespeare . Here a summer weekend hardly passes without some troupe donning doublets and tights  --  or T-shirts and torn jeans  --  and launching into Elizabethan verse under the stars  --  or fog . <p> Is the Bay Area 's Shakespearean wealth an enviable embarrassment of riches ? Or is it market saturation ? Are the plays , and their audience , getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets produced , here as anywhere , for a variety of reasons , several of them obvious enough . Shakespeare is , by near-universal accord , the greatest English-language playwright ; the works that bear his name remain as gorgeous , fascinating , insightful and psychologically complex as they were the day they premiered . He also sells  --  to audiences , to funders , to boards of directors , to the press . With Shakespeare you get it both ways : genius and T-shirts , timelessness and Elizabethan tchotchkes . <p> In London and to a lesser degree New York , the Shakespeare industry is linked symbiotically to a vital community of diversely equipped actors . Kenneth Branagh and Kevin Kline are prominent examples of a class of performers who shuttle from classical texts to contemporary plays to film , a fluid marriage of art and commerce . <p> Such conditions do not apply here . While the Bay Area has produced its share of memorable Shakespearean performances over the years  --  most by actors who have since gone on to live and work in New York or Los Angeles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fuel the local Shakespeare engine . <p> That may help explain why the region 's major repertory companies have relatively thin records with Shakespeare . The American Conservatory Theater last produced him in 1991 ( " Hamlet " ) ; a new " Othello " is due this fall . The Berkeley Repertory Theatre has done no Shakespeare since " The Winter 's Tale " in 1989 . San Jose Repertory last checked in , with " The Tempest , " 10 years ago . <p> Perhaps audience members are more forgiving when they 're outdoors with a glass of wine in hand and an open picnic basket . The Bay Area 's Shakespeare boom is dominantly an open-air phenomenon . It also has become , increasingly , a director 's medium . <p> With the quantity of Shakespeare offered here , most of it compressed into the summer months , it 's no surprise that theaters want to make a splash  --  often by interpreting , or in the current parlance , " recontextualizing " the plays into other eras , world views , mind-sets . <p> Concept productions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in " Reinventing Shakespeare , " a stimulating cultural history of Shakespeare from the Restoration to the present , the playwright for centuries has offered directors " an inexhaustible plurality of meaning . . . . Each new interpretation appears to confirm the boundless intellectual hospitality of ( Shakespeare 's ) genius . " <p> But Taylor also wonders if a collection of plays written within a 25-year span 400 years ago can really support the enormous " inverted pyramid of interpretation balanced on a single point . " In at least several local cases this year , the looming pyramid nearly blotted out the plays and players . <p> Whatever director Danny Scheie was trying to say with his gender-contorted production of " Merchant " this summer at Shakespeare Santa Cruz , it buried the acting values of the company . Rhonnie Washington might well have made a persuasive Lear under other circumstances , but Tony Kelly 's grafting of a contemporary urban sensibility onto Shakespeare 's text in his Thick Description staging at the BRAVA ! Studio this summer provincialized the tragedy and its hero with contemporary quotation marks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " traditional " Shakespeare  --  whatever that might be . Indeed , from Peter Brook 's acrobatically abstract " Midsummer Night 's Dream " of the early 1970s to Scheie 's ebulliently playful 1988 " Comedy of Errors " in Santa Cruz , some of the most vivid Shakespeare productions in my own memory bank have been the most inventive . <p> But invention can also bloom in more conventional frames . The high point of my 1994 Shakespeare season was the California Shakespeare Festival production of " Richard II , " which closed last week at Orinda 's Bruns Amphitheatre . In director Penny Metropulos ' elegantly uncluttered production , James Carpenter unfurled a title performance that seemed spontaneously minted . Everything about this king , from his haughtiness to his honesty to a strange saintly aura , had the power to startle and convince simultaneously . <p> Carpenter 's thorny yet lucid performance reawakened me to what often seems missing in Shakespeare productions here : the primacy of character and language . Long after a director 's vision has burned off like a mist  --  or better yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to life onstage shines as though the performance had happened yesterday . <p> The indelible treasures I 've collected in 15 years of Shakespeare-gazing here include John Vickery 's heartbreaking Hamlet for the Berkeley Shakespeare Festival , Micheal McShane 's capacious Falstaff at both the Berkeley and San Francisco festivals , Annette Bening 's tender Juliet for the now-defunct Valley Institute of Theater Arts in Saratoga , David Baker 's fevered Romeo in Santa Cruz and Sydney Walker 's magnanimous Prospero in Golden Gate Park . <p> Today 's young generation of Bay Area actors enters a field that 's aflutter with more Shakespeare banners than ever . It can be a bewilderingly crowded scene . Who 's " Shrew " is it , anyway ? is this season 's riddle , with productions from the California Shakespeare Festival ( which announced first ) and the San Francisco Shakespeare Festival ( which opened first ) . The duplication produced some grumbling at CSF , which also is smarting a bit from ACT 's choice of " Othello " for the fall . CSF coveted the play for the summer of ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to insatiable Bardolatrists , but perhaps a little less of a great thing would be an even better thing when it comes to Shakespeare . With John Webster 's " The White Devil " last season and " Two Noble Kinsmen " this summer , Ashland 's Oregon Shakespeare Festival set little-seen works of the period in revealing relief against the strict Shakespeare canon . Tirso de Molina 's " The Rape of Tamar , " in a different way , expanded the historical compass of the Santa Cruz festival this year . <p> Actors , like audiences , need to draw on their deepest resources to make Shakespeare matter . <p> Overexposure and contrivance will never kill the plays , but they can dull our senses to them . <p> I , for one , want to be fully alert when the next performance like Carpenter 's " Richard II " comes along .
