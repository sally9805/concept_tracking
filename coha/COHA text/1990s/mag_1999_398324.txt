<p> I shared a bottle of beer with a guy on my softball team , and afterward I noticed he had a small sore on his lip . Is it possible herpes could be transferred from a shared object like a beer ?  --  B.G. , Jackson , Miss . <p> <p> It 's not the funnest way to get herpes , but yes . It is possible to contract the disease by sharing a glass or bottle with someone who has an outbreak on his lip . According to Peter Leone , M.D. , the risk of beer-bottle exposure is lower than from , say , kissing ( we suggest a hearty high-five after a homer ) , but it does exist . In fact , herpes simplex virus type-1 is very common ; there 's a good chance that the individual with the cold sore got it himself by sharing bottles , glasses , or something similar with another infected person . Tell him you prefer to drink alone , and that the team 's next game is BYOB . Health ALLERGY DOSING WITHOUT DOZING <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've resisted prescription drugs so far because I 'm afraid of the side effects . Will the hard stuff make me drowsy all day ?  --  J.A. , SACRAMENTO , CALIF . <p> <p> You might assume that prescription antihistamines would cause more grogginess than over-the-counter allergy medications . You 'd be wrong . A study found that 32 allergy sufferers who took Benadryl , an OTC antihistamine , did much worse on concentration and memory tests than 33 people who took the prescription drug Claritin . ( The study was sponsored , but not run , by the makers of Claritin . ) The researchers even compared the Benadryl users ' performance to the effects of brain disorders , which gives us a handy excuse for our behavior last weekend . Prescription antihistamines more accurately target the brain receptors that control allergic reactions , says Victoria Starbuck , Ph.D. , a neuropsychologist at Georgetown University and one of the study authors . But one drug , Zyrtec , still carries a warning that it may cause drowsiness . GET THE RED OUT <p> My doctor prescribed a topical gel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise , my face stays bright red for hours . Is there anything I can do ?  --  S.M. , PISCATAWAY , N.J. <p> <p> " This is a common occurrence when we 're treating rosacea , " says Allan Kayne , M.D. , of the University of Washington medical center . If it really bothers you , you can take a few precautions . Work out in an air-conditioned gym to keep cooler and minimize flushing , or take up swimming . A change in prescriptions might help , too . If your topical medication seems to be controlling your other symptoms and you 're in good health , your doctor may prescribe a beta blocker . " This is generally a safe solution for flushing , but only your doctor can say whether you 're a good candidate for it , " says Dr. Kayne . Fitness STRAIGHT OR KINKY ? <p> I do biceps curls with a straight barbell , but I see lots of guys using a zigzag bar . Which one is better ? Is there any benefit to using both ?  --  B.L. , OCEANSIDE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called an EZ Curl , and it works the same muscles as a regular barbell . " Because of its shape , the EZ Curl bar causes the forearm to rotate slightly , and some lifters say they feel like they 're getting a better ' pump , ' " says Swapan Mookerjee , Ph.D. , of Bloomsburg University in Pennsylvania . " But there is no significant difference in muscle activation between the two types of curls . " So there 's no advantage to using both bars in your workout , unless you 're simply trying to add some variety . Business IT 'S HOTTER BY THE COOLER <p> I just started dating a woman I work with . Do I have to tell my boss ?  --  M.G. , AURORA , ILL . <p> <p> If it 's his wife , keep it quiet until after the performance review . Otherwise , it depends on your work relationship with this woman , says Ronna Lichtenberg , author of Work Would Be Great If It Were n't for the People . If she 's a subordinate or a client @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , regardless of where the relationship is headed . " In those two cases , your boss should hear it from you rather than through the office rumor mill , " says Lichtenberg . When you do talk to your boss , do n't make too big a deal about it . " Say , ' I just wanted to give you a heads-up in case this makes you uncomfortable , ' " Lichtenberg suggests . Quick Fix PUNCHING OUT THE CLOCK <p> I stay up late on weekends . But even if I sleep for 8 hours afterward , I 'm still tired . Why ?  --  T.M. , BROOKLYN , N.Y . <p> <p> Unlike your bedside clock , the dials of your internal timer ca n't just be spun to fit your partying schedule . " Even if you try to sleep the same number of hours , you wo n't feel as refreshed because your biological clock is out of sync with your irregular sleep habits , " says James B. Maas , Ph.D. , a psychology and sleep specialist at Cornell University . " Biologically speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the early-afternoon low point in alertness . " You 're better off waking up at your nor mal hour and slinking off for a power nap later in the day . IRRITABLE-BOSS SYNDROME <p> When I 'm having a bad day at work , I feel as if my guts were constricting inside my torso . What causes that feeling , and how can I get rid of it , other than by killing my boss ?  --  J.G. , REGINA , SASK . <p> <p> That sort of thing never happens here at Men 's Health , so we had to check with Michael Wolfe , M.D. , chief of gastro-enterology at Boston University 's school of medicine . Dr. Wolfe suspects that you 're suffering from irritable-bowel syndrome , a painful contraction of the digestive system often brought on by anxiety . The symptoms can range from a nervous flutter to nauseating pain accompanied by constipation or diarrhea . Minor pain can be handled by deep breathing and other relaxation techniques , he says , but for persistent cases , ask a doctor about antispasmodics and other medications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel as if I 'm going to pass out when I eat ice cream or anything else cold . Anything I can do to toughen them up ?  --  P.K. , KIRKSVILLE , Mo . <p> <p> Yes . You actually can toughen up your teeth . The reason they 're hurting is that your cementum-the protective , calcified coating that covers the roots of your teeth  --  has been worn down by food acids . That exposes the sensitive dentin underneath and leaves you suffering from screaming-chomper syndrome . <p> There are two remedies : a fluoridated coating your dentist can apply , or a toothpaste containing potassium nitrate , which you can use at home . <p> You probably breached the cementum not by eating sweets but by combating them , says Israel Kleinberg , D.D.S. , Ph.D. , chairman of oral biology at SUNY Stony Brook . " Diet soda , apple juice , and many mouthwashes  --  all of these are highly acidic liquids that eventually expose the dentin , " says Dr. Kleinberg . " Hard brushing or the scraping dentists do to remove tartar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , NO PAIN <p> How can I get rid of varicose veins ?  --  R.Z. , LARGO , FLA . <p> <p> The most common treatment for varicose veins is sclerotherapy , an office procedure in which the vein is injected with a solution that softens the lining of the blood vessel . Then a special foam is applied to glue the walls of the vein together , basically making it vanish . After the procedure you 'll have to wear graduated compression stockings for about a week , which means you 'll want to leave your kilt in the closet . <p> You 'll need two to four halfhour sessions , which run about $200 to $300 a pop . Your insurance company may pick up the tab . Style PANTS THAT FIT <p> I wear 34 x 29 pants , but they 're really hard to find in stores  --  the shortest inseam is usually 30 . I can get them tailored , but that adds $15 to $20 to the tab . Are there any other options ?  --  H.G. , WATERLOO , ONT . <p> <p> According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the best companies for off-the-rack pants in odd sizes are Slates ( 800-752-8371 , www.slates.com ) , Savane ( 800-972-8263 , www.savane.com ) , and Haggar ( 800-942-4427 , www.haggar.com ) . Splitting hairs <p> The woman who used to cut my hair told me I should part my hair on the right , because that 's where my natural part is . The woman who cuts my hair now says there 's no such thing as a natural part , and that I should go back to being a lefty . How can I figure out who 's right ?  --  A.D. , WACO , TEX . <p> <p> Since your hair grows differently on different parts of your scalp  --  faster in some sections and slower , curlier , or denser in others  --  it forms natural parts , or " breaks " as they 're called in the comb-andclipper trade . To find your natural break , wet your hair and comb it straight back A , then push it forward from the crown B. It will fall into its natural pattern C. <p> If you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this warning from Marlene Vendittuoli , men 's grooming specialist for D.J . Rubin Salon in New York : " If you try to comb your hair in an unnatural part , you can turn yourself into a chicken head , with hair bulging out in every direction as it fights to go its natural way . " That look works only for Bill Gates . <p> DIAGRAM : Splitting hairs How to make an ass for yourself <p> Why do n't old guys have butts ? Is there any way I can preserve mine , before my jeans fall right off ?  --  M.V. , TOPTON , PA . <p> <p> There 's no published research on cheek atrophy in older males , but Stephen Seiler , Ph.D. , associate professor at the Norway Institute of Health and Sport , has a theory : The butt is composed primarily of the gluteus maximus . This muscle is actively engaged when the body goes into a relatively deep squatting position , or anytime the hip is powerfully extended  --  as it is when you 're sprinting , for instance . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do  --  outside the bathroom , anyway  --  so your glutes are likely to retire along with the rest of you . Eventually ( so the theory goes ) the gluteus maximus becomes superfluous and starts to atrophy . <p> Here 's how to keep your cheeks into old age , according to trainer Michael Mejia , C.S.C.S. <p> Step 1 Use a VersaClimber three times a week . Try 5 minutes at a time and build up to 15 minutes . If your gym does n't have a VersaClimber , use a stairclimber and take deep steps . If you do n't have access to either , climb real stairs two at a time . Go slowly , and always push off with your heels . Again , start at 5 minutes and build up to 15 . <p> Step 2 Now do 15 to 20 minutes on a treadmill . Use the highest elevation and take long steps . If you do n't have a treadmill , walk up a steep hill . <p> Step 3 Finally , do Bulgarian split squats , shown below . These force you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of you and one behind , as if you were sprinting . ( Is that why Bulgarians have such nice butts ? ) This gives your lower-body muscles a more intense workout than they 're used to , leading to the sort of development you see in athletes who sprint for a living  --  NFL running backs , for instance . ( If you do n't see what 's special about their flutes , ask your wife to watch a game with you some Monday night . ) <p> Do one to three sets of five to seven slow repetitions with each leg , three times a week . Do all your repetitions with one leg before you switch to the other to complete the set . If you 've never done lunging exercises with weights , start with your back foot on the floor ; , then progress to using a step , as shown . When you 're really advanced , you can put your foot up on an exercise bench . <p> Here s a way to get better results from gluteal exercises : Push off from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the like . If you let the weight shift to the balls of your feet , you 'll work your quadriceps more and challenge your flutes less . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : How to make an ass for yourself <p> Got a question about health , fitness , grooming , sex , work , travel , or any other subject we cover in Men 's Health ? .
