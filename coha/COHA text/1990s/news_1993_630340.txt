<p> To chef Lisa Cherkasky , a perfect pie is a work of art . <p> To food photographer Renee Comet , a perfect pie belongs in a work of art . <p> Their new cookbook , The Artful Pie ( Chapters Publishing , $ 24.95 ) , beautifully blends both of these concepts in a way that pleases both palate and palette . It even whetted the appetite of the National Gallery of Art , which is selling the book to hungry art-lovers . <p> Cherkasky and Comet , both longtime Washington food pros , admit the idea for the cookbook came to them " out of the blue . " There was no question that they would do a book about pie , however ; Cherkasky has been passionate about pie since she won over her first boyfriend by baking him one . <p> To produce the book 's appetizing still-lifes , the women asked 36 artists from across the country to create background artwork on which a single slice of pie would be placed . The artists were told they could pick any medium as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and included a drawn or painted plate for the pie . <p> The results were as wild and varied as the pies Cherkasky has been dreaming up since childhood . Artwork created from everything from the expected ( pencils , watercolors and oil paints ) to the unexpected ( sawdust , broken glass and jelly beans ) arrived at Comet 's studio . <p> The two women then matched each work with slices of pie , from ultra-smooth chocolate malted to summer berry chiffon . <p> " Some we matched to the art by color , some by mood and some because the work reminded us of the season the pie would be made , " says Cherkasky . The artwork " was all so different , so fresh , it was easy . " <p> If they had had any doubt that the concept would work , it was dispelled with the very first test photo . Everything clicked , recalls Comet , " when we saw the first Polaroid of ( Washington artist ) Craig Cahoon 's painting of a desert scene with a slice of Lisa 's lemon-lime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painted desert subtly enhanced the soft citrus tones of the pie , and the women knew the rest of the project would be easy as you-know-what . <p> For example , the artwork pictured by Rebecca Wood of Athens , Ga. , had a homey , old-fashioned quality that immediately reminded both Comet and Cherkasky of their mothers . That made it perfect for a slice of Cherkasky 's mother 's lemon meringue pie , a recipe that won Shirley Cherkasky a blue ribbon when she was a 14-year-old 4-H Club member . <p> To heighten the contrast in the photo , Cherkasky added two lemons and steam wafting from the teacup at the top . <p> Other whimsical works in the book include a scrumptious bourbon-spiked pecan pie cradled on artist Leslie Sapp 's glass mosaic plate , accompanied by a fork and spoon made from nails , atop a sawdust tabletop . <p> Some of the recipes are as intricate as the art . Several require old-fashioned , painstaking work , such as slicing lemon rind into tiny slivers or caramelizing sugar . Others , however , rely on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a team for seven years , this is the first cookbook they have done for themselves . Previously , they collaborated on recipes and food photography for Washington-angled works like The Wolf Trap Picnic Cookbook and Capital Classics Cookbook , as well as the Mrs. Fields Cookie Cookbook . Cherkasky , a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America , also has worked at several Washington restaurants .
