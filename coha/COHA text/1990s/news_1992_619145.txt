<p> WE TAKE IT for granted that art is best understood through experience . But the sculpture of New Yorker Jackie Winsor seems to put experience and understanding in each other 's way . <p> A touring survey of Winsor 's 25-year career , organized by the Milwaukee Art Museum , is on view at the Newport Harbor Art Museum ( through March 29 ) . It will travel later to Raleigh , Boston and Akron . <p> Winsor 's work is so labor intensive that her output to date amounts to only about 75 objects . It involves such seemingly rote procedures as wrapping forms repeatedly with hundreds of yards of string and coating the same surfaces with paint dozens of times . <p> So much of her life is invested in each work that in the 1970s , Winsor began requiring every buyer of a sculpture to sign an elaborate contract . Under threat of steep financial penalty , the contract enjoins a collector against any alteration or abuse of the purchased work , guarantees the artist a fraction of any profit from its future sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservation the work may require . <p> People seeing Winsor 's sculpture for the first time must wonder how it commands such stringent commitments . Many of her pieces take the form of a large hollow cube or sphere ( or some hybrid of the two ) , about waist-high , with small , precise surface apertures aligned along perpendicular axes . <p> Some pieces have more presence than others , but they typically exude the material intensity that marks much of the best American sculpture of the past 20 years . <p> A fair assessment of Winsor 's work requires some knowledge of the cultural setting in which her art took root . <p> She was born in Newfoundland in 1941 and describes her childhood in the Maritime Provinces as being 19th century in its horizons , although her father , an engineer , moved the family a dozen times . <p> Her life changed radically  --  from bucolic and unpredictable to urban and stable  --  when her family finally settled in Boston in 1952 . Showing an affinity for art while in high school there , she was invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusetts College of Art , where she later got a bachelor 's degree in fine arts . <p> She entered a graduate art program at Rutgers University partly because it meant easy access to New York . At Rutgers and in summer school courses at Yale , Winsor came in contact with faculty and fellow students who were in touch with some of the most provocative developments in contemporary art . <p> Its denizens had little doubt that New York in the mid- ' 60s was the world center of art , and Winsor was willing to live rough there just to be on the scene . <p> As a student , she had worked in painting , drawing and photography . When in 1967 she abruptly turned to sculpture , in which she had no formal training , she says , " I made up my own tools and my own rules about it . " <p> Winsor saw firsthand the rise of minimalism in New York galleries , and she came to be numbered among the artists who reacted against the simplicity and idealism of early minimal sculpture such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Confident that they were working in the crucible of future high culture , New York artists proceeded in the ' 60s as if what they did had universal significance . Sculptors such as Andre , Judd , Robert Morris and Robert Smithson looked with detachment on the conventional circumstances of art 's production and display and realized several things . <p> First , they saw that a person contemplating an artwork appears to represent a nearly pure instance of subject versus object . By objectifying their art to the greatest degree , they thought , they could turn the viewer 's experience of it into an emotionally cool investigation of subjectivity . <p> Morris , in particular , played variations on simple geometric solids , to enable people to discover unnoticed aspects of their own perception . When visual expectations were high and there was almost nothing to see , seeing itself became the center of attention , the content of the art experience . At least that was the idea . <p> Further , these artists observed that transgressing the conventional bounds of art presentation  --  by working in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful effects and implications . <p> By the time Winsor came on the scene , the aggressively hermetic objects of early minimalist art had given way to looser , more unstable forms , often in improbable settings . But ongoing was the project of making art objects touchstones of a critical , reflective awareness that ideally would come to bear on many aspects of life <p> The minimalist resistance to viewers ' projecting emotions onto objects  --  which reached an extreme in Andre 's adamantly inert sculpture  --  was giving way to curiosity about what it means that such projections are possible , perhaps inevitable . <p> Meanwhile , as the art boom of the 1960s crested , the " artist lifestyle " became a cultural figure ( or at least a media figment ) in its own right . This development paralleled a serious concern among artists about relations between their everyday behavior and the forms they make . " Basically , you make things out of the structure of who you are , " as Winsor put it some years later . <p> Artworks whose primary content is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winsor made the earliest objects in her current retrospective . <p> The minimalist program had been to deepen the divide between people and objects . This program found expression in the radical rejection of all analogy between art objects and their viewers . It was political in that the vulgar materialism of American life seemed to depend on people 's confusion about where they end and the things they own or desire begin . <p> Pushing off against what preceded them , artists of Winsor 's generation became newly curious about the subjective appeal of materials and forms . <p> Among the pieces in her retrospective are some early works in heavy rope . " Rope Trick , " for instance , is a six-foot length of hawser that stands straight up on end , apparently unsupported ( in fact , fixed to a steel post ) . It is plain rope , on the one hand , yet its twists evoke muscular tension and its uprightness is insinuatingly phallic and spinelike . <p> Plywood became a key material in many of Winsor 's subsequent boxlike pieces . It is most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an eight-inch-thick stack of square wood sheets that Winsor hollowed out from above with an ax . One of her best-known plywood pieces ( not at Newport Harbor ) is a single square wrapped with countless rounds of twine until it resembles a giant serving of Shredded Wheat . Pieces like these restored to sculpture the human touch that minimalism had purged . <p> In an interview with John Gruen , Winsor explained her attraction to these materials in decidedly post-minimalist terms : " What interested me about , say , the rope , was that it so stubbornly had its own personality . It really persisted in identifying itself : its weight and heaviness and , as you pulled it out , its linear quality . Its personality was so strong that I wanted to bring part of me to it . When I started working with ropes , I thought I would never work with plywood . I mean it was so trashy ! However , after a point . . . I began to use it . When the personality of plywood became clear to me  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to sit on the floor and began laminating it . . . The point is , my opening up in its direction made me understand the personality of plywood . And that 's true of all the materials I use . It 's a question of really identifying with them , responding to their realness  --  to what they bring to you and what you can bring to them . But that involves a lot of time and a lot of work . " <p> Most of Winsor 's sculptures break a cardinal rule of minimalist aesthetics ( and ethics ) : They dramatize relations between the inside and outside of an object . Such formal drama makes a covert analogy between the art object and its viewers . That is something to avoid in a culture that keeps people off balance by teaching them to dramatize  --  rather than examine  --  aspects of themselves that they believe are hidden and overt , respectively . <p> From making pieces that report their fabrication clearly , Winsor progressed to making things that conceal or mystify the processes and materials they involve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Manhattan police bomb squad ) and then reconstructed on the outside so it appears never to have been damaged . <p> The more elaborate box works are experienced almost as things that have had lives . They confront you , as another person does , with the impossibility of truly understanding what they have been through , and with the certainty that it has been a lot . ( This is how Winsor sets experience and understanding at odds . ) <p> Winsor 's show is handsomely installed at Newport Beach : It could n't look much better . But this is one of those retrospectives that seems to offer us the wrong end of the telescope : It diminishes Winsor 's art , rather than magnifying it . <p> HER process-conscious reinvention of the analogy between people and art objects looks retrograde now . Her most admirable pieces are the most rigorous , especially " Fifty- Fifty " ( 1975 ) , a cube that is half solid , half void , made of stacked , evenly spaced strips of one-inch- square wood . <p> " Fifty-Fifty " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of minimalist principles , but it does this systematically , rather than theatrically . And the internal surprise it holds is a real perceptual discovery ( and probably was to Winsor herself ) . The light that shines through the slats when you view the piece from the end at its level forms a sphere ( her other key form ) , not a square .  - -  @46973 <p> RESTAURANTS MAY come and go but the neighborhood bar endures , even when it changes names . The barstools at the Buchanan Grill are warmed by a group of upscale Marina regulars who have been loyal to the place since Bob Mulhern opened it as Mulhern 's 10 years ago . Under new ownership since last July , the Buchanan Grill maintains a clean , congenial California ambience , despite cigaret smoke in the room . Many patrons look as if they 've just jogged , showered , dried their hair and limped over to their favorite pub for a nice , warm supper . <p> Actually , the clubby , skylight-illuminated back room of this restaurant is kept free of smoke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , snow-white tablecloths and napkins , and bentwood chairs provide cheerful lunch surroundings in the sun-filled room . People choose from a number of starters , salads , sandwiches and hot plates on a familiar-looking menu . <p> Though the description implies something unusual , grilled pizza ( $ 4.95 ) turns out more like a toaster-oven " surprise " you might pull together at home . Lots of melted cheddar covers up Canadian bacon and mounds of cooked spinach on a crackery crust that stays doughy in the center . A green salad ( $ 3.73 ) of beautiful baby mixed greens gets coated in a tart , fruity , unbalanced dressing that suggested sour pineapple juice . Miniature deep- fried crab cakes ( $ 7.95 ) have runny interiors that melt into a pool of beurre blanc , tasty only because it is rich . An Oriental chicken salad ( $ 7.95 ) came piled on the plate , a haystack of romaine , bean sprouts , crisp fried rice noodles and bits of chicken in a peanut dressing . For dessert , a slice of refrigerated , soggy-crusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacked charm . <p> While the host and manager working the room could n't have been more welcoming and personable , our waitress seemed harried . She charged us twice for dessert and was annoyed at having to redo the check , rather than apologetic for the error . <p> Service at dinner in the barroom on another night was back on track . If smoke does n't bother you , the raised dining room in the bar is a warmer place to eat . Even if the food does n't live up to the expectations that the trend-conscious menu raises , the dishes are nicely presented and not too gummed up . <p> A warm spinach salad ( $ 5.50 ) with quartered mushrooms , pancetta and grated egg was delicious , something I 'd order any time . The Caesar salad ( $ 6.50 ) looked picture-perfect with flawless , cut romaine , craggy croutons and a snowfall of freshly grated Parmesan , but a pallid dressing broke the spell . Linguine with clams ( $ 10.95 ) in a marinara sauce infused with way too much oxidized garlic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( $ 12.50 ) on a bed of black and white beans tasted washed out , but the cooking juices must have flowed into the beans . A 10-ounce New York steak ( $ 14.95 ) , though tender , had a slightly off flavor . It came with crusty roasted potatoes and fresh tomato salsa . For dessert , a heavy slab of pumpkin cheesecake ( $ 3.95 ) appealed to those who like the dense New York style . Glasses of Rodney Strong Cabernet ( $ 3 ) , a reasonably priced list of California bottles and pots of good , strong cafe filtre ( $ 3.50 ) agreeably support the meals at this attractive Marina watering hole . <p> THE DOUBLE PLAY <p> When Mulhern sold his place in the Marina , he bought The Double Play , a bar in operation since 1909 at a location that old-timers remember as being across the street from Seals Stadium . Now The Double Play is kitty-corner from the Auto Center , but it still pulls in a crowd of crusty regulars who fill the place daily at lunch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fans that have made this vintage bar of stained-glass transoms , antique photographs of San Francisco sports heroes and clouds of cigaret smoke . <p> Lunch is served in a bright back room crowded with small , blue-and-white checked tables and solid wooden chairs . A bank of multipaned windows looks onto Bryant Street . Slow-moving ceiling fans do n't seem to move the smoke around much . Neither the decor nor the kitchen was changed by new ownership . The food at the Double Play , as pristine as the sports memorabilia on the walls , should be regarded as a piece of San Francisco culinary history . <p> Minestrone ( $ 2.50/cup ) , with a tomato broth , chunks of mushy zucchini , similarly textured pasta shells and an assertive dried-herb presence , hit the spot one chilly day . A shrimp salad Louie ( $ 7.95 ) features wedges of iceberg lettuce with bright , blanched carrots , broccoli and cauliflower , gray-edged hard-boiled eggs , a classic pink mayonnaise-based Louie dressing , and a pile of smelly tiny bay shrimp . Calves ' liver ( $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , with watery sauteed onions and crisp bacon , but it had a nice , sweet flavor . A ground sirloin steak ( $ 7.50 ) was flattened out and juiceless . <p> If you get there early , no later than noon , you can still order the daily specials , which are the best bets here . One day a plate of corned beef and cabbage ( $ 7.95 ) brought lean but moist slices of meat with soggy cabbage , carrots and potatoes . A roast pork plate ( $ 7.95 ) offered a trencherman 's portion of crusty but tender pork slathered in brown gravy with mushrooms and accompanied with overcooked vegetables and precooked pasta tubes in meat sauce . A cup of smoky , pureed split pea soup ( $ 2.50 ) and a house salad ( $ 2.75 ) of iceberg lettuce with a perky creamy Italian dressing on the side were decent starters . <p> Well drinks ( $ 1.75 ) come in small , short glasses , just the right size for a prelunch cocktail , and indeed , many trays of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was there . A seven-bottle wine list provides succor at great prices , as evidenced by a Chianti Riserva , D'Aquino , 1983 ( $ 3.25/glass ; $ 13/ bottle ) . A cadre of salt-of-the- earth-style waitresses and a personable bus person keep the drinks and the food flowing . The best part of the meal , besides the drinks and the authentic old San Francisco ambience , is crusty , very fresh sourdough rolls . Real San Franciscans can make a lunch out of them . <p> BUCHANAN GRILL <p> 3653 Buchanan Street ( between Bay and Marina ) , San Francisco , 346- 8727 . <p> Open for lunch 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m .
