Section : World report The Agreement brokered by the United States will face some formidable obstacles <p> When Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic said that he would speak for Bosnia 's Serbs during Balkan peace negotiations in Dayton , Ohio , he was n't kidding . It was not until just before President Clinton walked into the White House Rose Garden last week to announce that an agreement had been struck that Milosevic showed Bosnian Serb delegates the map depicting the sensitive territorial concessions that made a deal possible . Nikola Koljevic , the senior Bosnian Serb at the talks , could n't believe his eyes : The new boundary line snaking its way across Bosnia 's disputed lands put Koljevic 's own farm inside the territory allocated to his enemies , the federation composed of Bosnia 's Croats and the Muslim-dominated government . He fainted , American officials were told . When he revived , the angry Bosnian Serb refused to initial the agreement or even attend the ceremony . <p> It is yet another Balkan irony that Milosevic , the Serbian Machiavelli who delivered the war in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man who delivered the peace at their expense . But the agreement produced by 20 days of tortuous negotiations on a spartan American air base is only the beginning of an end to Bosnia 's troubles  --  and the start of Bill Clinton 's riskiest foreign-policy initiative yet . " On paper we have peace , " said Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke , who orchestrated the extraordinary diplomatic ballet . " To make it work is our next and our greatest challenge . " <p> That challenge requires the muscle of up to 90,000 peacekeepers in a peace Implementation Force , known as IFOR , that would be spearheaded by NATO and 20,000 American troops ( story , Page 32 ) . " Without the United States there is no IFOR . Without IFOR there is no peace , " says Bosnia 's outgoing Foreign Minister Muhamed Sacirbey . Whether IFOR will be available , and whether the Clinton administration 's campaign for peace in the Balkans remains on track , turns on the reaction of three skeptical constituencies : the American public , the U.S. Congress and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , it is the Bosnian Serbs who appear to have the more effective veto . As long as there is significant Bosnian Serb sniping at the agreement , " the conditions for deployment do n't exist , " says a senior military official . Washington demands widespread acceptance of the plan as a precondition to sending American troops , and the Pentagon is nervous . According to a senior Pentagon official , the top brass will be reluctant to recommend deployment to the president unless Bosnian Serb leaders clearly renounce all statements of dissent and sign the agreement at a formal ceremony scheduled for the second week of December in Paris . <p> Milosevic wasted no time in starting to bring the rebellious Bosnian Serb leadership to heel . In a stormy 12-hour meeting , he won grudging acceptance of the deal from Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his colleagues , including Koljevic . Karadzic and the top Bosnian Serb general , Ratko Mladic , both of whom have been indicted for war crimes , reportedly would agree to resign their positions as well . <p> But Washington wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bosnian Serbs , or if peace implementation falters , economic sanctions  --  suspended by the United Nations within days of the agreement  --  can be automatically reimposed on Serbia . " It 's the only leverage we have , " says a senior State Department official of this diplomatic bank shot . <p> There is much for all sides to dislike in the Dayton agreement . The deal cedes numerous ethnically cleansed towns and regions to the self-styled " Republika Srpska " map , Page 28 . And , for the immediate future at least , it ratifies the de facto dismemberment of Bosnia  --  with a weak central government and separate armies and police forces . " This is not a just peace , but it is more just than a continuation of war , " a subdued Alija Izetbegovic , the Bosnian president , said of the bargain . <p> Defiant . Many Bosnian Serbs are even less enthusiastic ; within hours of the agreement , the president of the Bosnian Serb parliament and a delegate at the Dayton talks denounced the deal as " an especially bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away territories that we defended with blood . " Some Serbian residents in Sarajevo vowed to burn their houses before turning their neighborhoods over to Bosnian authority . <p> Despite doubts all around , the agreement offers the best chance to date to end the bloodiest conflict in Europe since World War II . It also preserves at least the potential for a unified , multiethnic Bosnian state if future generations of Bosnians can put the haunting memories and enmity behind them . " All Bosnia will be together , but it will take time , " predicts one Muslim refugee in Croatia . " When you have to work for a living you do n't care who it is who is paying , or working , for you . " <p> After years of covert military assistance in support of Serbian efforts to carve an ethnically pure state out of Bosnia , Milosevic appears to have abandoned his dream of a " Greater Serbia . " Instead , his new vision stars Serbia as economic tiger  --  the " seventh gateway to Europe " as he put it to bemused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult task . Intelligence intercepts of Bosnian Serb phone calls from Dayton to the Bosnian Serb capital of Pale copied a steady stream of invective . " If the people are anything like the leaders , then we are in trouble , " says an American official who was at the center of the negotiations . At least some Bosnians believe that it will be difficult to achieve peaceful coexistence . " Until all of us separate from each other , there will be no peace , " says Ilija Sucic , a once prosperous Croat farmer who is now a refugee . " The agreement could last five or 10 years , and then there will be war again . " <p> Capitol Hill , in particular , will be watching closely to see whether Milosevic can deliver general Bosnian Serb acceptance of the peace plan . It is unlikely that Congress will be able to block the deployment of American troops if Clinton is determined that they must go . But the White House would dearly like some political cover , and it wants a vote on a resolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If the Bosnian Serbs come out flat against it , it will be very damaging to the administration 's case , " says Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain . Congress also worries that the Clinton administration 's plans to help arm and train the Bosnian Army will give Bosnian Serb forces a strong incentive to target American troops in an effort to force a withdrawal . Congressional critics and pundits will have plenty to aim at : the map 's four volatile land corridors , the conflicts sure to erupt as refugees try to reclaim their homes , the voluntary nature of disarmament plans , and continuing Muslim-Croat friction . <p> Senior administration officials hope that arms control measures called for in the Dayton agreement but not yet finalized will minimize the requirements of an arms assistance program . But there will be dangers no matter how carefully IFOR proceeds . " If we make a commitment to this we 've got to expect some casualties , " says Army Chief of Staff Gen. Dennis Reimer . <p> Hard sell . To answer doubts about American participation in the IFOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ featuring a presidential speech from the Oval Office and a large-scale invasion of Capitol Hill hearing rooms by senior administration officials . " Our values , our interests , and our leadership all over the world are at stake , " Clinton said last week in the Rose Garden , voicing the theme of the administration 's case . " We will get the Senate as long as we respect the Senate 's concerns , " predicts a senior State Department official . But the House of Representatives will be a hard sell . " We all know the politics of this are against it , " says Indiana Democrat Lee Hamilton , who supports the dispatch of troops . " The American people do not favor this , and there is a possibility for major political gain by opposing it . " <p> Election politics already is muddying the debate . " I have no confidence in the Clinton-brokered peace deal and I will oppose sending troops to Bosnia , " announced Sen. Phil Gramm . Sen. Bob Dole has said that the president has yet to make his case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congressional support , the peace agreement represents a political gamble with little upside and enormous dangers . Body bags always come to rest at the feet of the commander in chief , and for Clinton , the election-year timing could not be worse . " He has spent so little time speaking publicly on foreign policy that , despite successes , he has almost no heat shield in this area , " says Michael Beschloss , a presidential historian . <p> Given the risks , senior administration officials admit , not all Clinton 's advisers were comfortable with the prospect of success in Dayton . But after watching three bitter rivals initial the agreement and then shake hands , Secretary of State Warren Christopher  --  who conducted more than 60 hours of negotiations over the final four days  --  had few doubts . " There is a lot of responsibility in this , " he told an aide in a moment of private reflection . " But it is so much better than failure . " For now .

Bosnia will remain a loosely unified state composed of two political entities : a Muslim-Croat federation and a Bosnian Serb republic  --  Republika Srpska . Under the Dayton accord , both sides will have to cede territory they currently control . To enforce the agreement , as many as 90,000 NATO-led troops  --  including 20,000 Americans  --  will police three sectors inside Bosnia . The peacekeeping force , known as IFOR , will be headquartered in Sarajevo , the capital . Territorial swaps . The Muslim-Croat federation won key territorial concessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure land corridor to the eastern enclave of Gorazde . The Bosnian Serbs failed to win the widening of the 3-mile-wide Posavina Corridor connecting Serbian territory in the east and the west . But they did retain control of some ethnically cleansed territory , including the former " safe areas " of Srebrenica and Zepa . War crimes . Serbia , Croatia and both parts of Bosnia must cooperate with the United Nations war crimes tribunal . Indicted war criminals can not hold elected office , and peacekeepers will arrest indicted war criminals they encounter . Right of return . More than 2 million war refugees will be allowed to return freely to their homes or receive compensation . Bosnia in 1991 <p> The country was a patchwork of ethnic Muslim , Croatian and Serbian enclaves . Now the ethnic mix roughly corresponds to current areas of control . The war 's toll <p> It will take years , and billions , to rebuild the former Yugoslavia <p>  --  Estimated number of war-related deaths : 250,000 <p>  --  Number of Bosnians wounded in the fighting : 175,000 ; Croatians : 33,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war in Bosnia-Herzegovina : $60 billion <p>  --  Current Bosnian gross domestic product per capita : $300 <p>  --  Population of Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1991 : 4.4 million ; population today : 3.5 million <p>  --  Estimated number of those affected by the war , including refugees , displaced persons and those in need of U.N . assistance in all of the former Yugoslavia : 3.5 million <p> MAP:A Peace plan for Bosnia <p> MAP:Bosnia in 1991 <p> War Crimes CAN THERE BE JUSTICE AS WELL AS PEACE IN BOSNIA ? <p> Richard Goldstone , the chief prosecutor of the United Nations war crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia , earned a reputation in his native South Africa as a dogged opponent of apartheid . Now , answerable only to the U.N . Security Council , he has shown the same determination in his pursuit of war criminals as high as possible up the chain of command of all the warring factions . Goldstone 's noble pursuit of justice , however , has the potential to wreck the Dayton accord . <p> To date the tribunal , based in The Hague , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven Croats . More indictments are expected by the end of this year . Yet only one man , Dusan Tadic , is in custody ; his trial will begin next May if defense witnesses can be found . More important for the peace deal , the indicted also include Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic , Croatian Serb leader Milan Martic , a senior Yugoslav Army officer named Mile Mrksic and two top Bosnian Croats  --  Tihomir Blaskic and Dario Kordic  --  all of whom have so far been shielded by the Serbian and Croatian governments . <p> NATO troops are mandated to arrest any of the indicted if they find them . And the tribunal is guaranteed unrestricted access across all of Bosnia-Herzegovina , including Serb-held territory . Should Belgrade obstruct the tribunal 's efforts , economic sanctions can be reimposed on Serbia . <p> This confronts Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic with some hard choices . At Dayton he pledged to cooperate fully with the tribunal , which Serbia earlier had refused to do . Serbia 's Constitution , however , bans extradition to face trials in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tribunal  --  as does the Croatian government , which recently promoted Blaskic . Milosevic , moreover , is personally at risk : U.N . investigators have been gathering evidence against him related to atrocities in Vukovar during the 1991 Serbian-Croatian war but so far lack clear proof of his complicity . <p> During a visit to Washington in November , Goldstone was assured of continued U.S. cooperation in the search for evidence . Yet finding such evidence against Milosevic , the linchpin in the peace process , could unravel the deal U.S. negotiators so painstakingly crafted . It may be that there can only be peace and justice up to a point in Bosnia  --  and that point is Milosevic . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Indicted . Ratko Mladic <p> Robin Knight <p>
