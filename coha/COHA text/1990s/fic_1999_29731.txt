Annie That morning , I had crawled in to work , my pressed white cotton blouse already damp and crumpled at the waist just from the ten-minute drive to the office . I was beat from the heat and sapped from a major wee-hours bicker with Stuart . We did n't fight , Stuart and I. I do n't think we ever really had a fight -- not a blowout of the kind my sister and her husband have twice a month and laugh about later . Don had such a habit of hurling the contents of a cup or a bowl at the ceiling during his rants that one year , for their anniversary , Rachie hired an artist to paint a mural of stains -- from coffee to ketchup -- on the kitchen ceiling , so Don 's outbursts would n't show . " He 's just loud , " Rachael said , " not dangerous . " Don loved the mural . He beamed at Rachael and said , " That 's why you 're my best girl . " " Enshrining their dysfunction , " Stuart commented when I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . " What Stuart and I had instead of fights were long , tortured , semantically dissective chats , in which each of us would try to out-lawyer the other -- as if anybody ever prevailed in a personal disagreement through the use of logic . The night before Arley Mowbray turned up in my office and overturned my life , the chat had been about our marriage , which either was or was not imminent , depending on which of us you talked to . Stuart had been pulling cruise folders out of the Sunday paper and leaving them on my nightstand for months , as well as speculating aloud about getting La Casita to cater its famous ranch eggs for a brunch . But I , for my part , was not picturing a beige linen frock and a straw hat in my near future -- though that was actually the only sort of wedding outfit I thought I could endure . Stuart especially thought it would be fun to fly to Las Vegas and get married early in the day so we could spend the night at the blackjack tables . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he 'd razzed me that night , as I rinsed the leftovers of Greek salad from the Fiesta ware we 'd just bought . " We could get one of those heart-shaped tubs . Like those old ads for the Poconos . " I had to laugh , picturing Stuart and me in a red enamel tub , disporting ourselves among the suds . I wonder now whether Stuart felt the boat rocking for us , that fall , long before I did . He had ratcheted up his suitor act a couple of notches , though at the time I could n't imagine why . People always say they know their lovers better than they know themselves , but when Stuart said that , it was literally true . Three days before I 'd get a cold , he 'd predict it by noticing a change in my eyes -- and he was never wrong . He could gauge how bad my day had been by how long it took me to turn the key in the front door , and he 'd be ready to offer a back rub ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a front rub within the first three minutes ) . My parents loved Stuart from the moment they met him , but I forgave him that , even though he sometimes teased me by urging my mother on the phone to exercise her parental rights : " Miriam , she wo n't set the date . Why ca n't you just give me her hand ? I thought that was how this worked . " Long silences afterward , during which Stuart would simply smile and nod , made me assume my mother had launched into her own visions for my wedding . Marrying off the plain older sister would , for her , represent a major victory . Given her way , Mom would have the lamps on the dinner tables encrusted with pale-pink furled rosebuds and would fly little second cousins in from Chicago and Flagstaff to strew petals . I would hate this , but Stuart would n't have minded . He was a real person in that respect , adaptable and forgiving , and he proclaimed himself up for any kind of ceremony , large or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and only . As for me , I 'd never thought seriously about Stuart and me being married . Or about our being apart . Both things had always seemed excessive . Since we 'd met in Chicago , where we were both public defenders and Stuart was just beginning his novitiate as a capital punishment abolitionist , we 'd marveled at our easy , undemanding fit . Displaced New Yorkers greet each other with pathetic relief no matter where they wash up , but almost instantly , it was clear that Stuart and I had a shared sense of things that went way beyond a common city of origin . We agreed on things no one else even considered . We both thought Dionne Warwick could sing rings around Whitney Houston . Locked in separate rooms and allowed to make only one phone call , we would each order pizza with green peppers and pineapple , easy on the cheese . We both thought Jack Nicholson was the world 's most overrated actor and Jackie Gleason the most underrated . " You can have all of them , " Stuart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinatown . You can even have The Godfather , Part Two . There is only one real movie . The Hustler . The Hustler is my life . " I could count on him never to say " presently " when he meant " currently . " He could count on me to be able to sing all the Belmonts ' parts if he sang the Dion parts on " Runaround Sue . " Ten years later , our routine was still just as predictable and satisfying . We worked all week like dogs and then gave ourselves over utterly to our daylong Sunday date , which only an execution , or the threat of one , could derail . A long , late breakfast and then a drive to one of the hamlets sprinkled around San Antonio . Thirty minutes by car , and you 'd feel time had dialed back thirty years -- that 's how small those towns , like the towns Arley and Dillon grew up in , really were . People sold Miz Stern 's settee or Miz Brainard 's quilts for the equivalent of East Coast pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The rare tchotchke aside , our antiquing journeys mainly amounted to wishful foraging , in the spirit of a more roomy and prosperous someday we somehow never really articulated . " We should just keep the furniture we have , Anne , " Stuart told me once . " By the time we get around to a house , this stuff will be antiques . " Do I remember the words and thoughts I had the night before I met Arley so clearly only because it was the night before ? Do things seem more meaningful because subsequent events etch certain cues into a framework that has more weight ? I remember rinsing the plates and listening to Stuart sketch increasingly weird motifs for our wedding , and I remember that I suddenly thought , Who will get the Fiesta ware ? Why did I think such a thing ? It scared me . " Well , Stuart , " I 'd said finally , " at least it 'd be a story to tell the grandchildren . Except there would n't be any grandchildren . " And that started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variation of a debate we 'd had six times , this one distinguished only by its more urgent tenor . I could make Stuart see all the reasons why I did n't want to get married unless we were going to have a child , and I could even get him to understand them . But I could n't get him to feel the same way . A child was beside the point , he would insist . The point was that " living together " at our age was just laziness or perversity -- trying to prove something to an audience of people who were either dead or no longer gave a damn . I , personally , thought that it was Stuart who was trying to prove something . Despite all his stalwart cheer , what I really sensed in Stuart about getting married was a great giving up , like the big get-it-over-with sigh he gave every morning as he got up off the couch to run , after lying coiled in the fetal position , his shoes unlaced , for fully ten minutes . He seemed to believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person , even if initially strenuous and cumbersome . " Stuart , you do n't regard getting married as an adventure , " I told him that night . " You do n't regard it as an adventure , either , " he replied . " But you should n't get married after ten years just because you 've run out of other things to do . " " I have n't run out of other things to do . I assumed that we 'd get married one of these decades , Anne . We 're the oldest living cohabitators in America . " " Not so , " I told him , picking up a bolster to throw at him . ( I hate this trait in myself , this willingness to cut the tension in a debate with jabber and slapstick when I should say nothing and let the frosty silence work my will , the way other women do . ) " Your uncle Stan and Missus LePollo are . " " They 're trying to avoid losing their Social Security . Pretty soon we 'll be doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What 've you got lined up for a week from Saturday ? Or Sunday , if you 're busy ? Let me make an honest woman of you , even if you are a lawyer . " " You mean that 's what you want to do ? Just mosey on over to the Bexar County Courthouse and lasso up a judge ? " " I already said it would be romantic to just elope . " " To downtown ? " " Well , you did n't seem to like the Elvis Chapel idea . So what do you want to do ? Rent the back room of Mister Allegretti 's in Hoboken ? Or did you want a chuppah , and a lightbulb to step on ? " It was kind of entertaining . And because of that as much as anything else , I did n't want to rev up the child thing . It was n't that I craved reproduction with every waking breath . But I was thirty-nine that winter night , and I figured that if I was going to give the matter an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , I 'd been sort of madly dicing around with our birth control in recent months , not really taking any reckless chances , but not covering every base , either , just to see if anything happened . Nothing had . Unlike virtually every one of my single friends , I 'd never had an abortion or even a serious pregnancy scare . My period marched in unremarkably every month , took off its cardigan , and stayed for the exact same four days it had since I was thirteen . Was I that careful ? . Or that sterile ? In the past few years , the distinction had begun to matter . And so I dithered around that night : I was n't ready to have a child right now . I was n't ready to say I never wanted one . I did n't spend my days at Women and Children First spinning fantasies about my own nestlings , but it was becoming increasingly difficult for me to see what reasons I had for choosing not to be a mother . " Stuart , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childless is that they 're tempted to have children but they know they have good reasons not to . I just do n't have those good reasons . " Did n't that sound sensible ? " A person does n't have a child because she ca n't think of a reason not to , Anne . And you do have reasons not to . You have a demanding , draining job --  " " Which I do n't even want half the time , " I interrupted . " I could do fifty other things . Part time , even . " This was the major difference between us : I found my work interesting and even compelling , but it was not a calling , as Stuart 's was for him . This often made things easier : when Stuart got the chance to work in Texas ( the equivalent of Jerusalem for a death row lawyer ) , I could tag along , certain I 'd find a job . And I did . I could even see myself working in private practice one day . It would not put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars a year , and I was still a doctor 's daughter : I liked my sheets to have the two hundred thread count , and I bought new running shoes twice a year , while Stuart wore his until they were as thin as ballet slippers . Capital punishment , the Knicks , and I -- in that order , I sometimes felt -- were the reasons Stuart got out of bed in the morning . " You 're getting to a dangerous age , " he 'd told me that night , making his opening argument for the prosecution . The defense objected : " People have kids much later now , Stuart . You know that . " " And there are already too many children in the world .... " " There are too many lawyers in the world too . " " Anne , " he pleaded , " you know what I am . You know what I do . When I think of that mix with a child in it ... " It was n't just the hours , the strain , the pitiless economic pasting they took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made salaries that did n't seem horrible on paper , until you factored in days that lasted seventy-two hours , none of them billable ) . All that did make for a fragile personal life , true enough . But the real reason death row lawyers did n't have children was that life was incompatible with death . For Stuart 's clients , everything that could go wrong with life had . " The mental slowness we pleaded was no stretch . The guy was a rock -- he was plant life with a tongue . " So Stuart 's best Texas friend , Tarik , once said of Willert Styles , a spree killer Tarik had battled three years to save , whose date with fate ( Stuart and his friends called an execution " dinner and a movie " ) took place just a couple of months before . " He was a bag of lawn clippings with legs , and his parents would have treated lawn clippings better . " " If they 're so worthless , " my girlfriend Jeanine used to ask Tarik , " then why is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's only important for them not to die , " Tarik would tell her . I 'd heard it all so many times . I even believed in it . I was proud of Stuart 's convictions . Still , an overwhelming lassitude seized me whenever Stuart pulled the " what I am " card in one of our discussions . From that moment on , it would be like running in cold syrup . We 'd pirouette around the impasse like smart people : Stuart would say his work was just like having a baby ; it ruined his sleep and trashed his social life . But it never grew up , I 'd respond , it never got smarter and made you a valentine . Back and forth . Back and forth . Point , Stuart , Advantage , Annie . The unspoken fact was that there was no way to compromise : one of us would have to blink . It was inevitable that we 'd eventually wash up on the place where there was nothing left but to consider what would happen if we could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Break up ? I knew that for Stuart , remaining the kind of loverly pals we 'd always been , in bed and out , was a life goal . But I did n't know if it still was for me . So that night I started to feel really sorry for both of us . How poignant it was that , despite neither of us really being wrong , nothing could really be all right . Sad , even contrite , Stuart began nuzzling my shoulders : another of his life tenets was that a nice sexy interlude could bridge all human spans . I did n't exactly disagree with this prescription , usually . But this time , unlike other times , neither of us must have prepared the ground for what took root between Arley and me . Of course , if you had asked me then , I would have told you that Arley 's kind of trouble was the distilled essence of everything about Women and Children First that could grind a lawyer to a stump . Some nights , my junior colleague , Patty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a just-girls night at our favorite haunt with a toast to Louise Marker Drew . Mrs. Drew was the Texas whiskey heiress who stunned her kin twenty years earlier by bequeathing her entire estate to found a legal support center for women in trouble . " To Missus Drew , " Jeanine would say , " defending the sacred right of women to make piss-poor life choices ! " Patty and I did n't really feel that way about our clients , not usually , not any more than Jeanine believed in chastity belts for her serial-birth mothers . Some of my clients squeezed my heart with their courage and gallantry . But others ... you did get weary . A young woman would show up with a fat lip and a big belly , and you 'd get her sorted out -- a training job , a place to live -- and eighteen months later she 'd be back , with the same fat lip and big belly . After seven years , burnout was not just a concept . At first -- in fact , for a long time -- I fooled myself into believing that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career crossroads , either a new beginning or a last hurrah . It was never that . It was , from the beginning , a person-to-person call , a near-biological obligation . I had n't had such an experience before -- how could I have recognized it ? That morning in December , all I wanted was for the poor and downtrodden to get their asses in gear and quit flopping over like carp for anything with hairy legs stuck in a pair of snakeskin cowboy boots with lifts . I was sick of hearing about how much some crankhead fruitcake looked like Michael Bolton and how , no matter how bad he was , no one else really understood how good he was inside . The name " Arlington Mowbray " was taped across the top of the first intake file in my In box . It was real Texas . Everybody seemed to have been named after a character in General Hospital . I took one look at the top line : " Female , aged 14 , married , wishes to obtain ... , " picked up the file , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it off to the first sap I ran into , Matt or Raul or Patty . After all , I was the boss . Why did I have to lead the charge into the valley of the doomed every damn day ? But as I was searching for my intended victim , I saw her . She was sitting in the lobby , just under the big plant shelf . Lilia , our secretary , was obsessively sponging off the philodendron , and the tall , dark-haired teenager did n't even seem to notice the drops of water that spattered her purse , her arms , and the folder on the chair beside her . It was n't just that she was beautiful , though she was . What was remarkable was that she seemed not to have been touched by teenhood to the slightest degree . Her rope of shiny dark-brown hair hung over one shoulder in an ordinary braid . She wore no jewelry ; her ears were n't pierced with even a single punch -- a fashion statement most girls would have considered wildly conservative if not worse . Strangest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thick wings of her brows , her skin was as pure as an eight-year-old 's . As I watched her that first day , I saw her reach around reflectively to grab hold of the thick brush formed by the end of her braid and sweep it across her lips , a gesture I would come to know as intimately as the smell of my own pillow . Arley was reading Seventeen , and she was reading it the way I used to read Seventeen , as if she were studying for SATs . I saw her run her thumbnail furtively down the inside gutter to slice out a page , then fold it with the speed of a magician into the front pocket of her jeans , which , I noticed , were ironed . I knew what she 'd do later on : she 'd try to duplicate that stunningly coordinated ninety-dollar outfit with something in the same colors at Kmart for $15.99 , which she would wear with self-conscious delight for three weeks , until it opened at the seams and unraveled . I can think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touching intelligence -- but none of them would fully explain the immediate fusion . I 'd seen a great many young women in trouble , all needing my help or my protection , needing the things my credentials could provide . And a few had extraordinary potential . But of all of them , only Arley -- without the worldly wisdom to understand her presumption -- tried to offer me something in return . Propelled , and later terrified , by her own need , she recognized mine . I do n't know why . I do n't know how long I watched her ; knew only that after a time , I realized I felt like a peeper and should say something . But I could n't . I could n't summon the words . I saw her look at her hair in the mirror , lift it up on the back of her neck and turn , gazing at her reflection in the fish tank across the room as if she were peering into a pond . She tried a haughty look . She tried next to look deliriously joyful , putting on one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the midst of saying , " I 'm having the time of my life ! " And when I saw her do that , I was lost ; I know that now , and she knows it too . Those first moments , I was swamped by a tidal current of memory for my sophomore self , when I was so desperately unhappy that I kept threatening suicide , until my mother finally said , " So kill yourself already . Just shut up about it . " " Do n't ever cut it , " I finally said to Arley that day , forcing myself to stride into the room , holding out my hand to shake . She grinned . " I 'm not going to cut it . I 'm just going to hate it , every day from now until January , when the weather cools off . " " And when it 's cooler ? " " Then I 'll feel like a princess . " " So it 's worth it ? Or is it only half worth it ? " That stopped her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topic of hairstyles , and maybe I was . " I need to see the lawyer , " she said then , a splash of color lighting her dark skin . " I have to do this " she pointed to her file --  " because I have to go back to school . " " Are you in college ? " I asked , just to see what she 'd say . " I was going to say I am , " she told me , with a level look . " But you all got the facts of me right in front of you . I 'm only in high school , ma'am . Freshman year . " " So what brings you here ? " She brushed her lips with her braid , thoughtfully . " I guess because I think they should respect a person 's civil rights . " " This person is you ? " " Yes . Me and my husband . My husband Dillon . " " You really are married , then ? " She stared hard at me . " Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes . " " Are you my lawyer ? " " I might be , if it turns out that you need a lawyer . " " Then you already know about what I 'm here for . I told the lady . " " Why do n't you tell me ? " " I am legally married . Even though I 'm ... well , I 'll be fifteen . " " When ? " " In April . " " And , Arlington , just how --  " " It 's Arley . Arley Mowbray . Well , now it 's really Arley Mowbray LeGrande . I 'm sorry to interrupt , ma'am . " " Pretty name . " " Arlington is the name of a town . Between Dallas and Fort Worth . " " Is that where your family is from ? " " No , I ... we 're all named after towns in Texas , my sister and my brother and me . " " Why ? " " Well , my mama --  " she began , and then said , " Does that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just making conversation . " " Yeah . " " So how did you come to marry so young. ? " " It 's not so young . We just read Romeo and Juliet , and she was exactly my age . " I could n't help but smile . She saw it . I said , " Yes , but that did n't work out so well . " " This will . " " I hope so . " I took her into my office , and she immediately began playing with the perpetual motion gadget on the desk , just the way every child who came into that space did , instantly and with utter concentration , experimentally plomping the steel balls on strings one against the other . I paged through the intake forms again , thinking almost exactly what Stuart would say later , that Arley 's story was fit for the Hallmark Hall of Fame of bad ideas . Not everyone goes to prison for just cause , particularly in the republic of Texas , but from the facts , Dillon LeGrande came from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter of the lower forty-eight . The eldest of four sons of a mother widowed once by a refinery explosion and once by a knife fight , Dillon seemed to have more or less raised himself in the little town of Welfare , one of those single-tavern burgs on the ragged hem of San Antonio 's outskirts . Arley 's family lived only a few miles west , but their orbits did n't seem to have overlapped , despite their having attended the same magnet school in Alamo Heights . Dillon 's brothers were roughneck punks , in and out of foster care and baby jail for the usual **25;128;TOOLONG stuff , but Dillon seemed to have stayed out of trouble -- officially , anyway -- until the night he and his brother Kevin decided to take a friend and his handgun and hold up a gas station in Comfort , a few miles north of their home . The hapless kid working the cash register ended up with his left arm shattered by a gunshot wound , and Dillon and Kevin wound up in Solamente River Prison . As the elder and , supposedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Arley and Dillon had begun corresponding in September . She 'd visited him once . He 'd pledged his troth . For two full weeks , they 'd been husband and wife . I sighed . Ordinarily , I started interviews with a stab at outlining goals : Why were we here together ? What had happened and what was needed ? But for some reason I found myself eager that day to influence a situation I knew very well was none of my business . And so I asked Arley , " What possessed you to do this thing ? What possessed your mom to sign for it ? Was he your boyfriend before he went in ? " Arley shook her head . " I did n't have a boyfriend before him . I just got to know him through the letters . " " Three months ago . " " Three months . " She squared her shoulders then and said , " He 's really good . " And I knew what she meant -- good in the sense that applies to a child , or to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might only be fifteen --  " " You 're fourteen . " " Okay , but I know what I 'm doing . I know what I 'm doing when it comes to this . My husband -- Dillon -- has a clean record for his ... incarceration , and he really should be out in less than two years . It 's all right there . " " So what 's the problem ? " " Ma'am , " said Arley , coloring deeply , " he needs me to be with him before that . " I could tell it was killing her to do this , and I felt like a shit . She would not have said any of this for worlds , except that Dillon mattered more to her than her sense of decency . I did n't realize then what an exaggerated sense that was , or why , though I would come to see that Arley 's decency was exactly like her skein of heavy hair -- equal parts discomfort and joy . " He wants a conjugal visit , " I suggested . " And I do too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You want to have sex with him . " " I want to ... be close to him . " I put my face in my hands . " Well , Missus LeGrande , unless there is something that you are not telling me , unless there is something I learn about your husband that you have not told me : for example , that his record suggests that he constitutes a risk to your health or well-being "  - -  beyond the obvious , I thought --  " or a risk to the security of Solamente River Prison , your request and his petition together should work . Now , your responsibility --  " " I can pay .... " I sighed . " Well , you pay what you can pay . We generally work those things out fairly well . But what I was going to say was , your responsibility is to tell me the truth and give me some patience while I try to work this out without litigation -- that is , without having to --  " " Without going to court . " " Exactly . Because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and your husband and the state of Texas and , God knows , me . " " Well , I can be patient . " I hope so , I nearly said , looking at her and thinking , You have n't been a bit patient so far ; why ca n't you be patient enough to grow your last inch or two before you load all this on ? I wanted to say , Kid , this barge is never going to get any lighter , and it will only sink lower in the water , no matter how fast you pole or bail . But there was something in her gaze , a kind of pleading , that suggested she already understood everything -- the sorry way this looked , the inappropriateness of her claim , the risk of shame -- about this thing she 'd launched , and that it was beyond her , entirely beyond her , to correct the path of flight . And I sensed what I would later know : that Arley needed no help from me at experiencing guilt or regret . That she 'd seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young life . I 'd learn that she had created a plan on paper , her Book of Life Goals , out of fear of growing up the way she 'd been raised -- that is , recklessly -- and that , much as she loved Dillon , it hurt to see her carefully written entries on sports and clothes and manners become so many sticks and ladders , marks in rainbow ink , meaningless as bird tracks . As we stood up , I managed to avoid the impulse to pat her shoulder . Suddenly she pointed to the purple folder she carried and said , " I 'm going to leave this with you all now . But there 's just one thing . " I sighed . " What ? " " In our letters . In here . You 'll see that I lied at first . I said I was older . " " I see . But he knows now ? Everything ? " " Yes , ma'am . Everything . And he does n't mind . " I looked at the lean curve of Arley 's waist and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll just bet he does n't one bit , but all I said was , " Well . Then it 's no problem for me , I suppose . " I watched her close the door behind her , and said to myself , Well , we will just have to find a way for this girl to land as softly as possible . Then I sat down with my cold coffee , to read the " evidence " in her purple folder , which she 'd labeled in filigreed sticker letters , " Dillon and Arlington LeGrande . " Continues ...
