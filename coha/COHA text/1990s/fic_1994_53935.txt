THEY COULD N'T FIND HIM . The party had just become a party , tame scientists finally imbibing enough to act a little careless and speak their minds , every mind happy , even ecstatic . That 's when someone noticed that the old man was missing . To bed already ? Just when the celebration had begun ? But someone else mentioned that he never slept much , and it still was early . And a little knot of technicians went to his cabin and discovered that he was n't there , precipitating a good deal of worry about his well-being . The next oldest person in the observatory was barely seventy  --  young enough to be his granddaughter  --  and almost everyone feared for his health . His strength . Even his mind . Where could he be ? they asked themselves . On a night like this . . . of all nights . . . ? <p> Search parties began fanning through the facility , and the security net was alerted . Cameras watched for a frail form ; terminals waited for his access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't visible or working . That much was certain after an hour of building panic . <p> It was one of his assistants who finally found him . She was a postdoc and maybe his favorite , although he was a difficult man to read in the best of times . What she did was recall something he 'd mentioned in passing - something about the cleansing effects of raw light  --  and she remembered a certain tiny chamber next to the hull , built long ago and never used by the current staff . It had a window to the outside , plus old-style optics , an old-time astronomer able to peer into a simple lensing device , examining the glorious raw light coming straight from the giant mirrors themselves . <p> She found him drifting , one hand holding him steady , the long frail body looking worn out in the bad light . It looked even worse in good light , she knew . Bones like dried sticks and his flesh hanging loose , spotted with benign moles too numerous to count . The cleansing effects of light ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and the opportunity to abuse his skin . More than a century old , and the postdoc felt her customary fear of ending up like him . Lost looks ; diminished energies . And she was n't an authentic genius like him . No residual capacities to lean against , the great long decline taking its toll  --  <p> " Yes ? " said the astronomer . " What is it ? " <p> She cleared her throat , once and again , then asked , " Are you all right , sir ? We were wondering . " <p> " I bet you were , " he replied . Only then did he take his eye off the eyepiece , the haggard face grinning at her . " Well , I 'm fine . Just got tired of the noise , that 's all . " <p> She did n't know how to respond . Leave now ? Perhaps she should leave , if he wanted quiet . <p> But when she turned , he said , " No , " with force . <p> " Sir ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As always , she did as she was told . She kicked across the room and used a single eye , knowing the trick but not having done this nonsense in years . Why did anyone bother with lenses ? Even when this observatory was built , digitized images were the norm . The best . And besides , what she saw here was just the focused light from a single mirror  --  a representative sampling of the whole  --  meaning it was almost useless to their ongoing work . Too simple by a factor of ten million . Yet she was n't the old man 's maybe-favorite for nothing , feigning interest , squinting into the little hole until he seemed satisfied . <p> " It 's the same as last time , " he said , " and the time before . It 's always the same , is n't it ? " <p> She looked at him , nodding and saying , " Why should n't it be ? " <p> " But does n't it amaze you ? " He asked the question , then he spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazes me . Do you know why ? Because you grew up expecting to see the beginning of time . When you were a little girl , this place was catching first light with its first mirrors , and by then the goal was obvious . Is n't that right ? " <p> A little nod , and she thought of what was out there . It did amaze her , yes , and what right did he have to minimize her feelings ? But it was n't exactly the beginning of time either . She remembered the digitized images , scrubbed clean by computers , contrasts added and the noise deleted . She could see little blobs of spiraling light  --  the earliest galaxies  --  and the best images resolved individual stars . No , it was n't fair of him to claim a greater amazement . Not when she thought of the work she 'd done , the long hours and the years invested in helping him and everyone else , a great mystery now solved , more than likely  --  <p>  --  and the old man was laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joke ? Had he been teasing her ? It would n't be the first time , of course . <p> " No , I 'm not laughing at you , dear . " He smiled , implanted teeth too white to be real . " I 'm the amusing one . I look at you and remember someone else . Please , please do n't take this wrong but you 've always reminded me of her . " <p> He 's been drinking , she realized . At least a little bit . <p> " A young woman , but she seemed infinitely old at the time . Seventeen years old , give or take , and nearly as beautiful as you . And the first woman I ever loved . " <p> She said nothing . <p> " Can I tell you about her ? Let me , then you 'll be free to go back to the party . I promise . It 's just a little story , a slice of life tale . I know you do n't want to hear it  --  " <p> " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but indulge me . For a few moments , please . " <p> Of course . She held the eyepiece in one hand , feeling the residual heat left by his hand and knowing she had no choice . This was a duty , perhaps even an honor . Nodding she looked out the thick window , watching half a dozen mammoth mirrors hanging motionless against the starry background , collecting photons from near the beginning of time . . . helping to support the theory that he , in part , had formulated . . . . <p> " I was eight years old at the time . " <p> The woman 's imagination strained , picturing him as a boy . <p> " Forever ago , " he said , " or yesterday . Depending on how you count these things . " <p> His parents sent him to a day-camp in the country , and he still could remember waiting for the yellow bus that picked him up at the corner . It was a noisy , stinking bus full of loud kids , and he always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver as possible . The driver was authority , and he believed in authority when he was eight . He thought it was important not to make enemies or get into trouble . A lot of the kids were older and larger , a few of them almost thirteen , and they seemed dangerous . It was the same as school  --  the same as all life , he imagined  --  survival depending on being quiet and small , keeping in the shade of authority whenever possible . <p> His parents meant well . To them , the camp was a peaceful retreat with docile horses , a spring-fed swimming pool and a staff of smiling well-scrubbed adults . At least the brochures promised as much . The truth was that the horses were fatty and ill-tempered , and the pool 's water had a suspicious odor . The staff were teenagers , one particular fellow holding sway over the others . His name was Steve or something equally ordinary  --  a fellow almost big lean and strong in a haphazard youthful way . He wore Western clothes , complete with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every waking moment . His greatest pleasure in life was bossing around children . It was Steve who introduced the future astronomer to horseback riding and archery , plus a variety of games learned from a stint with that quasi-military organization , the Boy Scouts of America . <p> One afternoon , on a whim , Steve divided the kids into pairs and said , " This is a tracking game . Shut up and listen . " The miles were transparently simple . One person walked from a starting point , heading for the nearby trees , and every time he or she changed direction , two sticks had to be laid down , making an arrowhead to show the new direction . It was a race in time , and it should n't take long . Steve promised to sit on the porch of the main lodge , drinking beer and keeping track of the minutes . " And when you 're done , " he promised , " we 'll go down to the pool and you can take your daily pees in the deep end . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner was maybe a year older , a boy both confident and bold , and he went first , vanishing into the green woods while Steve counted down five minutes . " Go ! " He remembered running hard , reaching the woods and cool shadows , then pausing to let his eyes adjust , eventually spotting his partner in a little clearing uphill from him . The boy was kneeling in sunlight , setting a pair of sticks into position . Catching him meant walking a straight line . " That 's not fair ! " the boy protested . " You 've got to follow the arrows ! " And as if to prove his hard work and correctness , he took the astronomer back to each arrow , pointing to them with a barely restrained fury . <p> The other teams took longer . Once done , everyone reassembled , and Steve , using a fancy Boy Scout knife to open a new beer , said , " Five minutes head start . Set . Go ! " <p> " And play fair , " warned the astronomer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course he 'd play fair . He believed in rules and authority . Yet he had an idea on his run to the woods  --  a legal possibility  --  kneeling in the shade and pointing his first arrow in a random direction . Then he started to jog , heading uphill without varying his direction . The rules were being met , after all . The other boys and rare girls were behind him when the five minutes were up . He did n't pause , barely even slowed , and eventually it felt as if he 'd gone miles . He was utterly alone , and only then did he kneel and make a second arrow pointing ninety degrees to his first course . It was a big arrow , and the rules were more than satisfied . <p> Time passed . The angle of the sun changed . After a while he did n't feel sure about any directions , or even his approximate position . Some places looked familiar  --  perhaps they 'd passed here on horseback  --  but other places resembled virgin forest . What if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he had to spend tonight in the wilderness ? Angry with his own cleverness , he turned and pushed straight up a likely hillside , right through the heart of thorny brush and into the open green ground above the lodge , no sight ever so lovely in his long little life . <p> Walking downhill , he imagined the celebration accompanying his return . But instead of relief , he found Steve sitting on a folding chair beside the mossy pool , a swimming suit instead of jeans but the hat and beer in place . Steve 's response was to belch , saying " Look what drug itself in , would you ? We were thinking of getting up a search party . But I guess you mined that fun too . Huh ? " <p> The astronomer 's partner was even less understanding " What happened to you ? " he squealed . " You cheated ! I knew you 'd cheat ! " <p> The lone sympathetic voice came from the life guard 's chair . Her name was Wendy . She had a pretty face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunglasses hiding her eyes . Wendy was easily the nicest person on the staff , and when he walked past her , she made a point of saying " I was worried . I thought you might be hurt . " <p> " The kid 's fine , " Steve shouted . " Do n't make a big deal out of it , Wendy , Jesus Christ ! " <p> " And , " she said , " I do n't think you cheated . I do n't . " <p> She looked at Steve while she spoke , her face strong and unperturbed , and he felt there was something between them . He tasted it in the air . There was an understanding , real and precious . She glanced back down at him , the white nose shining . " You are all right , are n't you ? " <p> " I 'm fine . " <p> " Good , " she said emphatically . " I 'm very glad . " <p> MEMORY EXPANDS what 's important and what is strange , and that 's why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a single week . Every day was rich with adventures and horrors , his young body sore every night and his parents curious in a careful way . Was he enjoying himself ? They had to hear that their money was well spent . But can a young boy know if he 's having a wonderful time ? He had never been to camp ; he had no basis for comparisons . Maybe it was his fault that he was n't having great fun . " Oh , I like it , " he told them , wanting to please . His parents smiled . Was he making any new friends ? He thought of Wendy . Nobody else . But instead he mentioned his partner in the tracking game , which again pleased his audience , Mom and Dad nodding and grinning congratulating themselves for sending him to that piece of Hell . <p> It was Thursday when Wendy reminded everyone , " Bring your sleeping bags tomorrow , and a change of clothes too . " It was a day-camp , but the last day  --  Friday  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and camp outdoors , then ride home in time for the late morning cartoons . <p> " We 'll sleep up on the hill , " Steve told them . " Coyote bait in baggies . It 's going to be fun ! " <p> " Quiet , " growled Wendy . " Do n't say that stuff ! " <p> Steve grinned , stained teeth capable of a menacing air . " They know I 'm kidding , girl . They 're smart kids . Hell , they love me . Everyone loves me , Wendy . ' Cept you . Ever think why ? " <p> She just shook her head , turning away . <p> Next morning , at first light , the astronomer woke and found himself hoping to be sick . He looked for a nameless rash , for any excuse not to go . But there were no excuses , him dressing and collecting his belongings , his mother making a snap inspection and then passing him the miraculous sum of five dollars . " For emergencies , " she confided . The words seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend it . He made a pact with himself . There would n't be any emergencies , and he 'd come home alive and well . <p> Friday followed the usual routines . There was a horseback ride , his stallion fat and breathing wetly . Steve rode his thundering beast through the trees , trying to spook the others . Like always . Then came the morning archery contest , and the astronomer almost broke one hard rule . He was winning , even beating one of the older boys , and he saved himself unknown horrors by sending his last arrow into the gully behind the range . Steve made him climb after it , but that was okay . He found a fine old bottle hear the arrow , which made it worthwhile . Then came lunch , cold sandwiches and cheap strawberry pop . Then a round of capture-the-flag , followed by a long swim ; and somewhere Steve and most of the rest of the staff vanished . No one mentioned where to or why . Wendy sat above the pool , and she seemed uneasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clouds had rolled in . Dinner was hotdogs , boiled and bland . By then Steve and the others had reappeared , laughing and shouting , moving the furniture to one side of the lodge while drinking beer from a big metal keg . There never was any chance to sleep outdoors . By dusk , it was keep out of trouble . He already was drunk , though it would be years before the astronomer would appreciate what kind of fellow Steve was . Possessing an alcoholic 's constitution , his nervous system could function despite being thoroughly pickled . Kids and nondrinkers stayed clear of him . Particularly Wendy . Meanwhile others arrived from somewhere . They were teenagers , big and loud , and maybe there were n't many of them . Maybe they were n't even badly behaved . But to an eight-year-old from a tame , sober household , it seemed as if there were thousands of them packed into the lodge . A hi-fi played stacks of records . People danced while others drank beer and smoked , sometimes pointing to the kids huddled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughter . <p> Steve would watch Wendy , sometimes cocking his cowboy hat and making his approach . But she 'd spot him and shy away somehow . She 'd vanish into the bathroom or around to the other side of the room , Steve becoming puzzled , walking circles and finally spotting his love all over again . <p> It was a great drama  --  a drama that must have been played out through the summer  --  and it had rhythms and its rules . Wendy usually placed herself near the kids , perhaps feeling protective of them . And Steve 's approaches became bolder , failure having a cumulative effect on his frustration . It became late , probably not even midnight but that was very late back then ; and the party was running without pause , without even needing to breathe . " Which , " confessed the astronomer , " might be where I learned to dislike parties . " Then he smiled at the postdoc , pausing , nodding to himself and the eyes losing their focus . <p> The postdoc wondered if the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Seemingly changing the subject , he told her , " We 've done astonishing work here . You know , you deserve to feel proud . " <p> " I do , " she promised . <p> He drifted closer , and for an instant she feared he would make a clumsy romantic pass . But no , all he wanted was to peer through the eyepiece again . He squinted , watching galaxies forming in the first billion years after Creation . It was then that the universe had cooled enough and diluted itself enough to allow suns to form . But why like this ? Why make galaxies of that particular size and composition ? It had been a mystery for decades . Why did these oldest galaxies have a sameness of size and color ? And what mechanism caused them to be arranged in enormous groups , forming distinct wall-like structures stretching for hundreds of millions of light-years ? <p> Now they knew , or at least they thought they did . <p> The best clues had remained hidden . It had taken every mirror and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cosmic strings were just part of the explanation . More important were some dim dense plasma clouds  --  relics of a hotter , older era  --  and how each cloud was aligned beside one new spiral galaxy . Cosmic strings ran through both of them , making eddies in the primordial gases which in turn made suns . Just five years ago , researchers had determined that those earliest suns were divided into distinct sizes and colors . They came in twenty-three flavors , in essence . They ranged from orange pinpricks to blue-white giants , and what was stranger was their orderly spacing . Very odd , they seemed . Unlikely . Bizarre . <p> It was the old man 's suggestions that had made the difference . He had n't done the hard work  --  he would n't have known how , the youngsters much more skilled with computer simulations and high-energy physics  --  but he was the crazy one who suggested they were looking at the work of ancient , possibly extinct intelligences . What if the plasma clouds were organized ? What if they were truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first galaxies , arranging them in space in order to fulfill a great purpose . " Just suppose , " he had told everyone . " That 's all I want . Just suppose . " <p> Even the postdoc , loyal by any measure , had to wonder if the old man was losing his mind and common sense . " Why would they build galaxies ? " she had asked him . " What possible role could they serve ? " <p> But he 'd had an answer waiting . " Distinct kinds of stars might imply some kind of alphabet . A code . Maybe a coherent language . The giant black holes at the center can act as anchors or reference points . Look at the galaxy from above , and you can read everything at a glance . " <p> " Can plasmas be alive ? " she had inquired . <p> " Perhaps . In a smaller , hotter universe , perhaps they 'd evolved into intelligence . Maybe galaxies were used as elaborate transmitting devices . " <p> " Transmitting what ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I can guess . " A long pause . " What audience ? I do n't think the plasmas were chatting with each other . Look at the background temperatures then . Space must have been very , very cold already . From their perspective , I mean . Building galaxies was something done just before they dissolved . Before they died . It was the end of their time , and I think their intended audience had n't even been born yet . " <p> It was a crazy notion , and a great one , and a few people found the craziness appealing . They did some tests , made mathematical models , and found that indeed , each galaxy had its own inherent code . The best images were just good enough to read a kind of dictionary encircling the central black holes . It was stunning news , and the first translations had answered most of the central questions . Those plasma clouds , using cosmic strings as their pens , were visible writing their autobiographies . In effect , they were telling of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard radiations . Evolving and growing aware enough to recognize a doomed future . Billions of stars constituted life stories , their authors like old men and women huddling about a waning fire , jotting down a few last notes before their great sleep . <p> Die they did . Nearer , younger space showed no plasmas , but the galaxies persisted for a little while . Patient observers could resurrect old meanings , if they wished . But eventually the original stars aged and exploded , helping to form wild suns while spewing out carbon and oxygen and iron . And meanwhile , the central black holes swallowed anything close , the first quasars igniting , and human beings spotting those scalding lights back when this old man was a mere eight-year-old waif , attending summer camp , wholly unaware that he was the audience whom the great clouds had anticipated . <p> He was the new ruler of the universe . . . . <p> The postdoc thought of leaving , glancing at the door , wondering if she should tell the others that he was found . Found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , " you do n't remind me of Wendy . I barely remember the girl , quite frankly . " <p> With honesty and a certain impatience , she asked , " I do n't understand . Why are you telling me this story now ? " <p> " Because it 's pleasant . Because it 's important . " He sighed and said , " Because I want to tell it . " <p> She nodded and waited . <p> " Steve eventually caught Wendy , and by then he was titanically drunk . And I 'd guess , dangerous too . In my mind he seemed awfully dangerous . " <p> She knew those kinds of men . Too many of them , in fact . <p> " As it happened , she was near me when she was caught , and he shouted , ' Are n't you going to dance with me ? ' Poor Wendy . She had a look on her face , brave and scared at the same time . Then she made herself smile , telling him , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she snatched me off my sleeping bag and took me into the middle of the room , a new song beginning . I ca n't remember the song but I remember dancing and how I looked at the hi-fi as we passed . Each time I looked , measuring how much time remained . There is a certain similarity between these galaxies and our old-fashioned records , and maybe that 's the point of my story . " A long pause , then he said , " If anyone asks , tell them that I had my inspiration while remembering an out-of-date technology . The hi-fi . " <p> She gave a nod , thinking he was done . <p> But he said , " Later we went outside together . Wendy led me outdoors . " A sigh and a smile . " The lodge 's roof overhung a patch of dry ground , and we sat together and talked . I do n't remember about what . Though I think she told me , ' We 're okay if you stay with me . Steve 's gutless , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postdoc said , " I see . . . " <p> " No , I have n't thought about Wendy in a long time , " he admitted . " It 's the atmosphere tonight . It 's the meanings of stars . " He smiled at her with his too-white teeth . " I 'm glad you 're the one who found me . And just you . " <p> She felt honored and uncomfortable . <p> " Everyone 's so happy tonight , and why ? " He told her , " It 's because a great race from the dawn of time was dying . Dying and feeling the urge to leave some memory of themselves . And we 're the clever ones who are going to be lionized for seeing what 's obvious . " <p> She gave a little nod . <p> " For all we know , the Milky Way itself began as someone 's autobiography . We 're built on the scrambled , incoherent epic of something vast . And when our time passes , when every sun bums out , perhaps we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . " <p> The postdoc cleared her throat , then asked , " What happened to Wendy ? " <p> A smile grew on the weary face . " Later , much later , a friend of hers came outside and told her that Steve was asleep . Unconscious . She was safe again , and she turned to me , saying , ' Thank you for your help . ' Then she gave me a little kiss on the forehead  --  my first kiss outside my ugly old family  --  and she walked with me back inside . <p> " I remember my heart . <p> " I remember feeling its beat , and how I held Wendy 's hand with both of mine , wishing I did n't have to let go . Wishing time would stop itself and save this moment . I kept wishing I was special enough to make time stop . And that 's when I learned that I was n't so special , and everything is eventually lost , making room for everything else . And that 's not too sad . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made for the future , and that 's altogether not a bad thing .
