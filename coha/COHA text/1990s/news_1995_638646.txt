<p> WINDSOR - Colorado State 's Renaissance Man spent the last summer vacation of his foreseeable future holed up in a barn-like yellow garage . He needed one last project , one that could n't be further removed from either his football exploits or the academic grind of preparing for medical school admission . <p> As easily as he spent fall afternoons the past four years changing from a lab coat into shoulder pads , Greg Myers pulled on overalls . <p> Myers , an All-America free safety and academic All-American , spent his last summer before the " real world " exploring his alter-ego as the all-American grease monkey . <p> We 're not talking oil changes or spark plug adjustments . He did n't set out to re-invent the wheel , just four-wheeling . <p> Never mind that a year from now he should be able to afford almost any vehicle made in the world . Then again , if the NFL falls through and he goes straight to medical school , it will be a few years before he can buy any car his heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the rest of my life , " Myers said . <p> Consider the mix : the painstakingly restored body and frame of a 1983 Jeep CJ7 , the engine , transmission and gauges of an ' 88 Corvette and the greenish-black paint job from the palette of the Porsche 911 . ( He 's most proud of the paint job that changes from a black to dark green hue , depending on the sunlight . ) <p> " I worked 50 hours a week on it , " Myers said . " I put in a new suspension , painted the frame and the body , made the speaker boxes ( the number and location a trade secret ) . I worked harder at this job than any I ever had . It 's not going to help get into med school but I wanted to do something I wanted . This is one of the last summers for me . " <p> Well , it was n't exactly up and running as planned by the start of two-a-days because of a delay in the engine delivery . And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gets one , to restore cars . " I 'm really not mechanically inclined , " he said . <p> His first mechanical attempt came when he was 9 years old . He spent his summers at his grandparents ' farm in a tiny town in Kansas ( " Population 5 . " ) . " The first time I drove , grandpa took me for a lap around their land , " he said . " It was 40 acres . Then he got off and told me ' finish it . " ' <p> He did . Myers just learns best from hands-on experience . He 'll never forget his first college game , starting as a redshirt freshman in the 1992 season opener at Colorado . Ex-Buff Michael Westbrook took him to school , and Kordell Stewart threw for 409 yards . <p> " My eyes were this big , " said Myers . " Westbrook took me 60 yards that way . I learned more that game than the rest of that season . " <p> Humbled , if not humiliated , Myers was determined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense sank to last in the weekly national statistics , but Myers made progress . The improvement continued through last season 's assault on the Top 20 and Western Athletic Conference title . <p> During that freshman year , opponents stopped picking on the rail-thin safety who now stands 6-foot-2 , 195 pounds . He finished 1992 with 96 tackles , six interceptions and a No. 10 spot among the nation 's punt-return leaders . <p> As a sophomore , his reputation spread and opponents tried to avoid him , evidenced by just two interceptions . He added all-WAC return specialist to his all-WAC safety honors . <p> In the third game of last season , Myers went a long way to help CSU to its WAC title . After Brigham Young jumped on the board early with a 3-0 lead , Myers returned an interception 30 yards for a score . He picked off John Walsh a second time and was named Sports Illustrated 's national defensive player of the week . <p> Myers " makes reads where people are and he just takes advantage , " BYU running back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He just killed us last year . " <p> New Mexico 's oft-injured running back Winslow Oliver never played against Myers , he just watched from the sideline and studied film . " He 's patient , " Oliver said . " He 's not going to overrun you . " <p> And to think , Phil Myers ' advice to his son when he left for college was , " Coming from a small town , if you start by the time you 're a junior , great . " <p> This Wizard of Windsor was one of the small-town athletes who did everything but sell popcorn at halftime . Quarterback , safety , place-kicker , punter , basketball , sprinter , pole vaulter - he excelled at everything . He could have gone to high school in Fort Collins his senior year , when his mother moved from Windsor , but Myers would n't desert his teammates . <p> Myers had to leave eventually . The Air Force Academy really wanted him . " He 's very deserving of all his national accolades , but if he came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Air Force coach Fisher DeBerry said . <p> " I was real close to going to the Academy , " Myers said . " It was a lot closer than people think . What turned it was medical school . If I was n't accepted the first time I applied , I 'd have to do time in the military . The NFL was n't even a consideration for me then . " <p> Medical school is still foremost in his mind . His first choice is the University of Colorado , an institution he has sort of forgiven for not recruiting him in the first place . <p> While he spent hours cleaning and refinishing his car parts , his mind was racing with ideas for his medical school application statement . He does n't want to place too much emphasis on his football career , but does n't want to ignore it , either . How many other medical school applicants can say they drew a 4.0 the same semester they put their schools on the college football map ? <p> Myers has wanted to be a surgeon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a longer memory and pulls out an earlier product of his son 's craftsmanship - a wood plaque for Father 's Day , 1981 ( when Greg was nine ) with a drawing of an NFL helmet . <p> Maybe the CSU safety has seen too much gore on the TV hit " ER , " but Myers said he 's more interested in family practice , " Northern Exposure " style . <p> " I want to live in the mountains , but you ca n't specialize very well in those areas , " he said . " Maybe if I can just work at a hospital a few times a week . " <p> The future doctor could n't heal himself , but at least he could diagnose what went wrong late last fall . His most frustrating injury came on the opening kickoff against Wyoming and effectively canceled the last three weeks of the season . He pulled a leg muscle and he had n't tested it at full speed in eight months . <p> " I did n't tear the muscle , but it was full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt it in high school . I fatigued it that week and before the game I did n't stretch . " <p> He took off most of spring ball to prepare for the medical entrance board . While teammates were having fun in the spring game , Myers was taking the boards . He might re-take them , claiming the results were only all right . All right is never enough for a perfectionist . <p> But in contrast to the whirlwind trip to Orlando , Fla. , last December for the Jim Thorpe Award , an aching leg , and upcoming final exams , he 's finally learned to enjoy the perks of All-America status - there 's more if he makes The Associated Press team ( the traditional Bob Hope Show ) and gets a College Football Association post-graduate scholarship ( a trip to the East Coast ) . <p> Earlier this summer he went to Phoenix for the annual Playboy All-America shoot . " There were no bunnies , " he said . " They said someone got hurt by a beer bottle a year ago . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . At the Thorpe , it seemed more uptight . " <p> Still , Myers is uncomfortable with any attention that detracts from his defensive teammates . " You 're not going to see a better combination at defensive end than Sean Moran and Brady Smith , " he said . " Ray Jackson is as good a cornerback as there is . Our first-team defense is the best in the WAC . " <p> In an offensive rebuilding year , he also knows the defense will be counted on to retain its hard-earned foothold in the WAC 's first division . He 's not trying to take the pressure off himself , to live up to all the preseason honors and expectations to become the WAC 's first four-time first-team player . <p> " Every year it gets a little harder , " Myers said . " People expect a little more . I do n't think I 'll get the chance to catch the ball much . But the most pressure is the pressure I put on myself . " <p> It 's not just on the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders , Anthoney Hill , Andre Strode , Pat Meyer and Eric Olsen , provided a lot of the difference between CSU 's 10-2 season and getting by as just another WAC contender . <p> " The senior leadership will be hard to live up to , " Myers said . " We had some great leadership and we 're going to need that this year . " <p> CSU coach Sonny Lubick is simply making the same request of Myers and the seniors that he did a year ago of Hill , et al . " One of the reasons we had success last year was every senior had his best year at CSU , " Lubick said . " That 's what it will take for us to be successful this year . Greg should have an All-America year . " <p> But secondary coach Ron Lee lends another perspective . " I told Ray and Greg I want them to go out and have fun . " <p> If Lee is lucky , he might just get a ride in the Myers Funmobile.
