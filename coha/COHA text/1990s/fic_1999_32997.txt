September 21 , 1986 Hey Jayson , It 's me , Gerald SandersonBounceand this stuff is for you . Justine and I are practically just off the plane with it . We were in Europe this summer picking up our daughter who was doing her collegiate Year Abroad and ran into this old German guy in Flensburg near the Danish border . Strange story . We stopped not far from where we were going to stay that night so I could take a leak . The guy was there . I could n't really understand him , but it seemed that during the war Black American soldiers had n't killed him when they could have . He was grateful , but maybe they should have put him out of his misery . I mean the guy was a mess . He left the box at the desk for us . Tank suggested we look you up and get this to you , since you 're the only writer we know . ( Says you owe him for throwing that block of his that let you score the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it 's been a long time since we 've seen each other , but I thought this was important enough to say hello with . What you have is a copy . We have the original , if you want to see it , but it 's been written on every kind of paper you can imaginetissue , glazed , schoolkid tablet , wrapping , end pages of books , in pencil , ink , crayonman , it was a mess to copy . So if you even look at the original , it 'll start falling apart again . It had been wrapped in one of those old smelly raincoats where the rubber 's dried and cracked off . You should have seen us coming through customs with this ; they probably thought we had 200 pounds ofdope . I told customs it was research ( I finally did get my master 's in history ) . They rummaged around , asked the boss , made phone calls , and so on . Man they make it tough for you get back home . The Germans , when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camps , they were glad to let it go . Jay , this is a diary written by a brother , a piano man name of Clifford Pepperidge . Played with Sam Wooding , which was way before both your time and mine . Clifford was in Dachau . Yeah , Dachau . We drove there and checked it out . Even now the spaceit 's the size of about ten stadiums ; I mean it 's huge , and if you include the fringe around it that is now filled with young trees , it becomes a third larger . It 's a museum now . saw pictures of some other brothers , too . Could n't tell if they were us or Africans . Now I wonder just how many other Black people we never heard a peep about were in those places . Dachau must have been a bitch . I ca n't imagine what all those other camps were like . The way I figure it is this : the old soldier giving this to us , our knowing you , is a spooky triple play . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe a mysterious way . You know the Benny Golson tune " I Remember Clifford , " with lyrics by Jon Hendricks ? I know it was for Clifford Brown who died in 1956 , but when I play it now , I think of Clifford Pepperidge . It would be great if you could do something good with this . I 'm not trying to lean on you , it just would be great . Justine sends greetings to you , your wife , kids and grandkids . I 'm told you got a bunch of them . Any of them good ball players ? My ball club is going to be weak for the next couple of seasons , and if I do n't get some talent bopping into this school , I may have to teach history fulltime . Maybe it 's time for that , anyway . Playing ball does n't serve the same function it did when you were a kid or even when I was . It 's all about money now , not teamwork or building confidence . In any case , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything else and how maybe that bell that rang for him is starting to ring again . I know you know exactly what I mean . For the ball game , except that it is n't a game . You should know that we 've enjoyed reading your books , especially our daughter , Liz , who would love to meet you . All our best to you and yours . Give me a call when you 've finished . No hurry ; after all , it 's been in the box for forty-one years already . * * * Sunday , May 28 , 1933 My name 's Clifford Pepperidge and I am in trouble . I 'm an American Negro and I play piano , sometimes , and I 'm a vocalist , too . I should n't be here , but they did n't pay any attention to me when they brought me . Did n't listen when I was in Berlin , either . I am in Protective Custody , they call it , but I 'll be out as soon as they finish their investigation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hate this place . As soon as I do get out , I 'm hauling ass back home . I do n't care what it 's like . They never did this to me in New York , and until I left Storyville , after they closed it down , I managed not to have anything to do with the John Laws . That 's what back home was all aboutplaying music and keeping away from trouble because it was always looking for you . Damn . I 'd even go back South to get out of here . Any place but here . It could be worse . I could be over in the camp . There 's a sign on the front gate : Arbeit Macht Frei . Tues. , June 7 , 1933 I 'm a calfactor , a houseboy , and I am stuck here in Dachau with no way to get out . Except that if I 'm a good enough houseboy my luck may change . That I doubt since Malcolm , to save his ass , double-crossed me . That 's got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schwarze Kater in the Friedrichstrasse . Then he showed up at the Kater and usually sent me drinks . We recognized each other . Well . Malcolm worked at the American embassy . We got to be quite good friends , as he would say . He had a marked fondness for me and I played to it . He had money , lots of it . Even a popular colored entertainer who 'd played and sung with the great Sam Wooding did n't make the money Malcolm already had . Family 's rich . We used to sit around on a Sunday morning in silk bathrobes drinking champagne , trying to figure out who it was we 'd brought home with us from Kurfurstendamm , where everyone was good-looking , or from Nollendorfplatz , where everyone was not . It really did n't matter to Malcolm as long as I was there to join in the fun we always had , although the cocaine was really hard to come by with the Nazis running things . Hitler became Chancellor , so they made it , the Brownshirts , and Finck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has become a very popular place indeed . A-men and Z-men used it a lot . These are agents and squealers for the Nazis . You never knew when they would be at a party , until the next day when someone stopped by to tell you that Frankie or Teddy had been arrested with a Protective Custody warrant as a member of an unpopular category . It was getting awful around Berlin ; it was getting quiet in the Kater . The spirit was gone from the Friedrichstrasse , the Kurfurstendamm , the Jagerstrasse , the Behrensstrasse ; the Conferenciers did n't make jokes about the Nazis any more , and they introduced the performers on the bills with less flair and fancy than they used to . It was like the way it used to be once you stepped across the line from Storyville . I wanted to get away . I was dreaming of snakes all the time , and anyone from New Orleans knows that when you dream of snakes , you 've got enemies . But Malcolm did n't care . He did n't give a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I was an American and he was an American diplomat . And fool that I was , I believed him . We were still in bed on that Sunday morning when they came and found us naked as the day we were born . That was April 23 . Malcolm declared he had " diplomatic immunity . " They carried me away while Malcolm was saying , " Do n't worry . I 'll have you out soon . " He took my passport . I have n't heard anything from Malcolm since . It looks like I do n't exist . They say the embassy claims it has no record of me . But I was somebody in Berlin . At least I thought I was . So I figure that Malcolm got rid of my passport and the record of my check-ins , and that means I had no contact with him . Of course the cops know different . They arrested me in his flat , but I suppose Malcolm fixed even that . If Almighty God walked into Hitler 's office without signing in , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not walk in . Wednesday , July 5 , 1933 The camp used to be a munitions factory , they tell me . Some of the buildings and sheds are still standing . There are nine barracks inside the wall and ten outside . The ones outside are fenced around with barbed wire and are guarded . Almost no trees ; a few white birches , I think , and pines . Hot sun everywhere . No shade . They expect to keep 5,000 prisoners here . Dachau is a labor camp . No one here knows anything . Nobody cares to know anything . Never thought I 'd be so close to where I played a couple of datesMunich , in Schwabing . If I 'd had any sense , I would have got the hell out of Germany then , with the Nazis running all over . More obnoxious than in Berlin . Goddamn Bavarians . I came in a van from Berlin . A long drive , and they let us out only once to piss . Threw bread and sausages in the back . Arrived here mid-morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite six weeks . The SA and the SS cursed us out of the van into the sun . Gangs of men in gray uniforms , some harnessed like horses to big rollers and carts , moved back and forth , raising dust ; they groaned and grunted . Most of them had red triangles fastened to the right pants leg ; others had green , and some of those fellas looked as tough as the robbers and dope fiends in east Berlin . A few wore pink triangles , and when I saw those and looked into the faces of the men wearing them , I knew what was going to happen to me . I could n't work like that ; I played the piano . I sang songs . Everywhere I looked in those few minutes before my group was called , I saw men working harder than anyone I ever saw working on a chain gang . I started to shake . I could n't help myself . Another group was coming out . I tried to read hope in their expressions but there was none , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps . I concentrated on them to keep from shaking so much . My legs were like rubber . The SS were shouting and pushing . I felt a shoulder lean into my own to lend support . The man had gray eyes and a big square face ; his eyes were the saddest I 'd ever looked into , sad , but not afraid . The crush of the group and that shoulder carried me up the steps and inside a room that had as many SA and SS men as there were prisoners . I wanted to holler " I 'm an American ! You 've made a mistake ! You have no right to hold me here ! " I did n't say anything , of course . I 'd said all this in Berlin , said it in Tegel-Berlin . Did n't help . Not with these jokers . Every official eye found my face . I shook more . I could n't stop . The mass of black uniforms and the swastika armbands simply scared the pure-dee shit out of me . Then I saw him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find him . Dieter Lange it was , and he had more reason to be here , in a gray suit , than me . He 'd been a big Raffke in Berlin , a hustler , pimp , profiteer , a regular MacHeath , but his lovers were all men . He was a chicken-plucker who 'd always wanted to pluck a black chicken because they were so rare in Germany , and those he saw were already being plucked by someone else . But I had Malcolm by then . Besides , I never went out with men like Dieter Lange . The officer in charge called us to attention and then read from papers in his hands . All of us had been charged and convicted as dangers to the state , for hostility and immorality to the state , and would be held here in Protective Custody under Article 14 until further notice . We would be notified when we were considered to be rehabilitated and released . Achtung ! The thing about Germans is , give them a uniform , give them a little power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Germans , people like Bert Brecht and Paul Graetz and Joe Ringelnatz , who said I was an artist . I 'd never been called that at home , only in Europe . I guess I was so swelled up by that that I did n't notice other artists going to jail , being fined , or leaving the country . Hitler said the new art was degenerate . Especially jazz music . Entartete Musik . But I was an American . How could they do this to me ? When the officer called attention , all the SS and SA in the room began shouting and cursing again , turning us , shoving us out of the door , down those five steps , into the hot sunlight . Then we were marched into a smaller building where we had to squat while soldiers sheared our heads . They laughed at my hair , threw it up in the air , examined it . They were so busy having fun that they did n't notice how much I continued to tremble . Once I saw the man with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair his head looked like a rock . The floor was inches thick with hairblack , brown , gray , blond , white , straight , curly . In another room , where it was impossibly crowded and everything smelled like vinegar and sweat and stale cigarettes , we filled out forms and listed our belongings and signed papers without having time to read them . In the next room , as we were given uniforms , someone said to the soldiers throwing them out , to give me one with a green triangle . It was Dieter Lange . The SS screamed , called us pigs , bastards , freaks , communists , crooks , pricks . We peeled off our clothes as best we could and shoved them into boxes and gave them to the guards who gave us the uniforms . Dieter Lange said green again . He gave the man in charge of this business a piece of paper and turned to me . He told me to come with him . The uniform smelled and did not fit , and the SA were kicking me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a pause like there is just before your fingers come down on the keys , like just before you sing your first note , and it seemed that everyone in the room , prisoners and SA and SS alike , for just a second , looked at me , looked at Dieter Lange . Then I was out in the sun again , Dieter Lange , hands on his hips , looming in front of me . He said I had been detailed to him . He smiled and said , Kind Schokolade , said it softly . Told me not to worry . Until I was arrested in Berlin and double-crossed by Malcolm , I was an independent person , or thought I was . I learned my music without benefit of formal teaching . Singing came natural to me ; it was a way of saying something with tone and sometimes word that expressed more than just plain talking . Other , older musicians , sometimes when they were trying to conceal techniques or more often tricks , taught me without knowing they were . I could make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if one did n't find me first . I made mistakes . Malcolm was the biggest . Living in Europe , being considered a strange , exotic creature , gave me , I 'm afraid , a sense of being important , and that made me stumble and fall into this snakepit . Maybe it was because of the people I knew and traveled with . Most of them were well-off and did n't seem to notice that I was a Negro . It seemed that way . But walking behind Dieter Lange , the dust and the shouts merging somewhere near a point in my head that kept lifting toward a faint , I felt alone as I 'd never felt before . That sense of independenceit must have come from what I thought was the kindness of people , or from people who wanted something from me , or from people who did n't give a damn about me , reallyvanished . I was no longer trembling ; I was crying . There was Dieter Lange , a captain in the SS . But I remembered , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us play in the Berlin Zoo Roof Garden , Dieter Lange came into the Troika with his swastika armband half sticking out of his pocket , trying to hide his membership in the Nazis . I never laugh at people . I have never been mean to anyone , so I did n't join in the laughter and the shoving and the teasing . But here he was , now , getting into a car and telling me to hurry because he wanted to fuck me good . I was crying , but I was listening , too . When he saw me , Dieter Lange said , he 'd got one of his friends to give me a uniform with a green instead of a pink triangle because it went hard for queers in Dachau . They were sometimes , if lucky , placed with the political prisoners , the Reds , cutting turf and draining the swamp or working in the quarry , which was worst of all . This way , I was his personal calfactor , his private servant . And he could hold grand parties with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good with his superiors . He was the camp purchasing agenta job with all sorts of possibilities , and he was soon to be in charge of purchasing for other camps that would be opening in a matter of months . He thought all this was not bad for a better than average hustler . He 'd joined the party in 1928 and was accepted into the SS in 1931 , about the time he vanished from Berlin . He did it to be on the safe side , and it turned out to be the right move . Dieter Lange was very proud of himself . ( I have just found some extra paper , so now I can finish writing about my first day in Dachau . ) The Nazis were growing in power , he said , and there was not a city , town , or hamlet in Germany , and quite possibly Europe , that would not feel that power , sooner or later . He said he would make some inquiries for me , see what he could do . I asked how long my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one knew . He would have to be careful . It would be wise for me to make the best of a bad situation that could have been worse if not for him . If I were nice to him , he 'd be nice to me . He 'd always liked jazz music and my singing and playing . He would do his best to look after me . But if I became troublesome , he 'd have me back in the camp in a prisoner barracks in a flash . As it was , I could work around his home and help him in the office canteen in the camp . These were good jobs . It had been prudent , Dieter Lange told me , for him to marry . Her name was Annaliese . She went to Munich often , he said , to shop and go to the theater , the things women do , for there was n't much going on in the SS quarters and hardly anything in the town of Dachau . She was not demanding of his time or person . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortunate to have made such a good marriage . She would not be troublesome , for she knew nothing of life , having left the farm only a year ago when Dieter Lange met her in Munich at a rally . He was sure , he said , she had not even ever seen a real Negro . Friday , July 7 , 1933 God , I 've prayed all night . Did you hear me , God ? How can this be happening to me ? I know I did n't go to church . I know I lived like You were n't there , like I would n't have to pay my bill to You . Maybe You do n't want to hear from me because of what I am . I did n't choose to be this way , Lord , You know I did n't . And anyway , are n't we all Your children ? Is n't Your Kingdom of Heaven for all of us ? Forgive me for what I am . If I could stop right now , I would , but it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it please You if I killed myself ? Is n't life Yours to give and Yours to take ? Please , God , if You did n't hear me , just read this . Yes , I used to play music on Sunday so people could dance and have a good time , and I drank and took dope , but not for meanness ; some money , yes , to live on or just to have fun some times , but not to be mean , Lord . You know I 've been more afraid than mean . I 've turned the other cheek a thousand times . I 've not hurt anyone , because I ca n't . Does n't Your word say " Blessed are the meek for they shall see God ? " Lord Jesus God , Holiest of Spirits , help this poor Negro so far from home and in the deserts with Satan and the serpents . Do n't forsake me , Lord . Hear me , O God ! I 'll do anything You want , anything , that I can do . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening or reading , Lord . Or , Lord , is this Your will , visiting trial and tribulation upon Your obedient servant ? If it is , Lord , give me the strength to bear this heavy , heavy cross . Thy will be done , Almighty Lord , but why me ? ( Continues ... )
