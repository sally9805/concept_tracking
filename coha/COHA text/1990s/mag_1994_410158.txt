My son , Eli , was born in the spring of 1993 , and there was never any question that my husband and I would take him with us wherever we could . Ever since he was strong enough to hold his head up , he 's played passenger in a baby backpack ( from L.L. Bean ) , happily ensconced on his daddy 's back , taking in he world . Skiing and snowboarding are part of this world , and so our first Family Ski Vacation was only a matter of time . The alternatives  --  Eli staying behind , David or I staying behind , or worse yet , neither of us skiing at all  --  were basically out of the question . We decided to go to Jackson Hole . Yes , this Wyoming classic was a rather unconventional choice for a " family " ski trip with a 10-month-old . Jackson Hole : a hard-core hotbed , a mecca for gonzo wannabes everywhere . A huge ski area , with 2,500 acres of skiable terrain , half of it designated for experts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thigh-burning feet . Home of Rendezvous Mountain , a burly hunk of Teton rock sporting bowls and cliffs and Corbet 's Couloir , that infamous proving ground of ski manhood ( and occasionally womanhood , I presume ) . Many ski resorts that cater more specifically to kids have cartoon-character mascots like Goofy and Bullwinkle ; in Jackson Hole 's case , it would be the Tasmanian Devil . And yes , we considered the usual suspects  --  places that start with S or V  --  before deciding on Jackson Hole . These were our essential needs : fully licensed daycare , jet service out of New York 's La Guardia Airport , and a room with a fridge and microwave for the preservation and preparation of infant victuals . Jackson Hole met these requirements , as did a lot of other ski areas . But Jackson Hole was alluring . The ski area had changed hands in 1992 , and the new owners were determined to broaden its appeal . One of their first improvements was to expand the childcare center . As a new mother , this impressed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new image , for Jackson Hole . I wanted to see it for myself , to tickle the soft underbelly of the big , bad wolf . Top-quality childcare was key . The fact that top-quality skiing came with it did n't hurt . But the Jackson Hole valley is much more than a ski destination ; it 's a theme park for nature lovers , a place where the process of nature has n't been subsumed by the progress of man . Most of the valley lies within Grand Teton National Park ( Jackson Hole 's airport is the only one in North America within the boundaries of a national park ) , and it 's bordered by Yellowstone National Park to the north . All manner of God 's creatures fly , swim , and roam undisturbed in this region ; the valley is home to the National Elk Refuge , a 25,000-acre haven for the thousands of elk that migrate down from the high country every fall . The progress of man is not without its appeal , of course , and for that there 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackson Hole ski area , but like any true ski town , it has a historical character that precedes skiing . Jackson is the real McCoy , a century-old community saturated with Old West mystique and folklore  --  fur trappers and cattle drives , shoot-outs at high noon on dusty streets , the Kerchunk of spurs on a wooden sidewalk . And Jackson has a Benetton outlet . " We 're there , " I said . If only getting there were that simple . You ca n't take your baby to the supermarket without lugging a diaper bag at least twice the child 's body weight , so try taking the kid on a ski trip . Piled on the curb at the airport , our mound of bags had a greater vertical drop than many Midwestern ski areas . Eli 's case alone weighed a good 50 pounds . It was loaded with quart-size cans of formula , empty baby bottles , clothes , diapers , a dozen jars of baby food , toys , and books . David and I had a carry-on item each , plus Eli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit under the seat ) . An amiable , undemanding little guy  --  this was before he discovered the concept of " no "  --  Eli spent most of the flight sleeping in our arms , waking occasionally to amble up and down the aisles , play peekaboo over the seats , and spit mouthfuls of Sprite onto my chest . Landing at the Jackson Hole airport is like dropping into the middle of nowhere  --  a staggeringly beautiful nowhere . In mountain-man parlance , a " hole " is a lone valley surrounded by mountains . The Jackson Hole valley is SO miles long and 15 miles wide , and all but three percent of it is state or federal land , wide-open and undeveloped . With Eli in a car seat in the back , we drove our rental car south toward town through the valley , a snow-blanketed expanse punctuated by the occasional butte . To our left was the elk refuge ; to our right , several miles across the valley , was the Teton Range , rising from the valley floor so abruptly that it practically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area in there , " I marveled out loud . A few minutes later , we passed through town ( " J. Crew outlet , check ; Ralph Lauren outlet , check " ) and headed to Teton Village , the spartan base development at the foot of Jackson Hole ski area . Banks of freshly plowed snow lined the short access road . We pulled into the Best Western Inn at Jackson Hole , and we were quite happy to let the bellman do the lugging . Our room , with its kitchenette and fireplace , was comfy but hardly baby-safe , so we spent a few furious minutes engaged in impromptu childproofing ( e.g. , the snowboard bag in front of a hot heating vent ) . Thus thwarted from maiming himself , Eli discovered the bathroom , where he gleefully snatched handfuls of Kleenex from the tissue dispenser and watched them float to the floor like mammoth pink snowflakes . Ten he scattered his toys around the hotel room , quickly turning it into a remarkable facsimile of our living room at home . We had dinner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moon 10 times in a row , and crashed . The next morning we zipped Eli into his purple fleece suit ( from Patagonia ) , which makes him look like either a giant grape or a miniature Barney the dinosaur . We draped our bodies with ski gear , kid gear , and kid , and headed to the Kids Ranch on the other side of Teton Village . We stopped in the tram building for sustenance at Nick Wilson 's Cowboy Cafe , an adorable eatery that had been redecorated in a nouveau-Western sort of way . Handmade metal light fixtures bearing brands from local ranches hung from the ceiling . Authentic lariats , cowboy shirts , chaps , and vintage photographs hung on the walls . David and I noshed on breakfast burritos while Eli wandered around clutching a bagel . An older man wearing orange Langes smiled at him , which Eli took as an invitation to suck on the toe of his left ski boot . " Sorry , he 's teething , " I explained lamely , detaching my son . What do you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed like a good time to finish our trek to the Kids Ranch . We knew we were close when we saw a woman pushing a stroller across the snow . The place was bright and cheery and so recently renovated that the scent of fresh paint still lingered . The woman behind the check-in counter greeted Eli as if she 'd known him forever . " He 's a Tenderfoot , " she said ( ages two months to 18 months ) . We signed the requisite releases and filled out the sheet entitled " Tell Us About Your Child " ( allergies , feeding times , favorite foods , any medications , etc . ) . We were given a numbered tag and , for security reasons , could n't pick him up without it . We briefed Eli 's " caregiver " for the day , a lovely young woman named Kim ( whew , she did n't look like an axe murderer ) , on the contents of his diaper bag . Then it was time for the big handoff . Eli had spent very little time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd react to a stranger . Would he wail as he was carried away , arms plaintively outstretched to us ? He went without a whimper . NO PARENTS admonished a painted paper cow taped to the playroom door , so we stood looking wistfully through the window as Eli toddled into the toy-crammed room , smiled warmly at a fellow Kids Rancher , and stuck a finger in the child 's eye . Peace of mind . Any parent knows you ca n't enjoy your ski day without it . Eli seemed happy , so we were happy . Now it was time to enjoy . We headed out to Apres Vous Mountain , Jackson Hole 's gentler half . A storm had just blown through , leaving behind a warm , baby- ; blue morning and pristine conditions . We cruised Apres Vous for hours , drawing out long , fast GS turns on silky groomers like Moran and Upper Werner , slamming the powder bumps on St. Johns and Sleeping Indian . On the lift rides up we speculated on how Eli was eating and whether he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the way down , we skied with our hearts half in our throats , feeling as if we would drop into the snowy valley below us . We could hardly believe our timing : Here we were , at one of the country 's great ski areas , sporting its best conditions of the season , and it was practically empty . It was a little ironic , since neither David nor I am what you 'd call your typical Jackson skier : He 's an intermediate skier with more guts than technique ; I 'm an advanced skier with more technique than guts . Yet Apres Vous fit us to a tee . We skied until the lifts closed at four and the setting sun gilded the jagged , striated peaks . We even managed to sneak in some hot-tub time at the hotel before picking up Eli at five . Kim handed us an Infant Report detailing what Eli had eaten that day , when he 'd napped , and what his mood had been . There were three mood options  --  Great Day , Little Bit Fussy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not too surprised , to see that she had circled Great Day . Indeed it had been , for all three of us . The next day was Fat Tuesday , so it seemed only appropriate to snowboard . David , who was new to riding , practiced linking turns on the flat beginner terrain at the bottom of Apres Vous , while I swooped down wide-open groomers like Gros Venue off the Thunder chair , milking the sides for whatever powder was left . I worked on my deep-snow technique in the crud on Amphitheatre off Nez Perce Traverse and swung metronomically up and down the banked walls of Sundance Gully . Even the most ardent parent and loving spouse craves those stolen moments of solitude away from familial demands and concerns . I know of no better place to find that freedom than a mountain , and no better vehicle for celebrating it than snowboard . Back at the Kids Ranch , Mardi Gras was in full swing . The staff had made colorful paper-bag costumes for the older kids . Now the kids were wearing them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shouting " Happy Mardi Gras ! " ( though I 'm sure they had no clue what it meant ) and tossing strands of plastic pearls that landed , shining , in the snow at my feet . You could spend your whole vacation on Apres Vous , but for the better skier , Rendezvous beckons . This is the fount of the Jackson Hole mystique , and the only way to the top is the tram . The tram is a classic , an icon of American ski culture . Skiing Jackson Hole without taking that eight-minute ride is like visiting Rome without seeing the Colosseum  --  you have n't fully done the place . On Wednesday morning David was nursing a sore back from his snowboard day , so I trammed it alone . The waiting crowd clambered on like passengers boarding a rush-hour commuter train , jostling for a place by the window . Teton Village fell away and disappeared . Paul Simon 's " Mother and Child Reunion " played over the tinny sound system . Purely coincidental , but a nice touch . Jackson Hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Behind us the valley broadened in increments , stretching toward the Gros Ventre Range like a starched white sheet on a freshly made bed . Below and before us the mountain unfolded , wild and untended , intimidating and inviting , all at once . To the north Grand Teton came into view . As the tram car neared the summit , Corbet 's appeared through the north window , a lethal-looking slice of ski insanity that induced an almost audible adrenal frisson among the tram riders . ( So did I ski Corbet 's ! Can you say No freaking way , boys and girls ! ) Management recommends Rendezvous Mountain for experts only , but that overstates the case somewhat . You should be able to complete your turns and control your speed , and you should n't be spooked by the prospect of skiing steep , ungroomed terrain . From the tram , you must ski through Corbet 's ( most skiers do n't ) or Rendezvous Bowl ( most skiers do ) . And the bowl is steep  --  up to 40 degrees in places . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bowl  --  is indicated by markers topped , somewhat misleadingly , with green circles . ( From below they look like gigantic lime lollipops on parade . ) Conditions in the bowl are unpredictable at best . I found them hospitable : The wind was low , the snow smooth and soft , with a phalanx of well-shaped , perfectly spaced bumps at the bottom . " You pushed a baby out of your body without painkillers , " I told myself , " you can do this . " And I did , feeling not nearly as elated and exhausted as when Eli appeared , but pretty pleased nonetheless . From the bottom of the bowl , you can make it as hard on yourself as you want . There 's the easiest way out  --  Rendezvous Trail ; the next easiest  --  Laramie Bowl , one side of which is groomed ; or the hardest  --  inbounds chutes like the classic Alta Chutes , marked in yellow on the map , for double diamond , which at Jackson Hole is a designation truly to be taken seriously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces  --  the Hobacks , Buffalo Bowl , North and South Colter Ridge  --  where Jacksonites snoop out the hidden powder , Alpine gumshoes of the steep and deep . And this is the bottom line : To get the most out of Jackson Hole , you must be a very good skier . Chutes , cliff bands , steep bumps , backcountry extreme  --  there is a reason that Doug Coombs and Emily Gladstone , the first couple of extreme skiing , who make mincemeat out of Alaskan death chutes , choose to spend their winters skiing Jackson Hole . " It 's the next best thing to Europe , " Doug to me , leaning forward , with a gleam in his eye . " The size , the shape , the scope . It 's not as crowded  --  as much of a frenzy  --  as other big mountains . I 'm addicted to the tram ; it 's the quickest , fastest vertical around . My favorite thing about Jackson is you can line yourself up in the fall line and just go and go . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hotel in downtown Jackson , drinking beers and talking , while David chased Eli around the lobby and a snowstorm whirled outside . We talked about Jackson and kids and lousy knees ( Emily was rehabbing from ACL surgery ) . Doug and Emily had just gotten married , and the issue of procreation loomed before them , with its accompanying dilemma of how to fit the demands of a child into their lifestyle , which was heavy on traveling to and skiing in remote , inaccessible locales . All I know , I told them , is that you make it work , that a child brings a new dimension to your life . They looked skeptical , but before Eli was born , I had been , too . It was getting late , so we parted ways . David and Eli and I walked through Jackson 's town square , which is anchored at each corner by giant arches fashioned of elk antlers . The arches , as well as the trees within the square , are strung with thousands of tiny bulbs that illuminate the park at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he repeated it again and again as we walked toward the car , as the snow was falling . As in many Western towns that cater to tourists , the Old West and the New do the two-step in Jackson . Upscale designer out lets , art galleries , and chic restaurants owned by expatriate Californians sit cheek by jowl with souvenir shops stocking plastic tomahawks . The most famous establishment ( after the Wyoming Woolens store ) is probably the Million Dollar Cowboy Bar , a high temple to Western kitsch with saddles for bar stools and a bar embedded with hundreds of silver dollars . Up on the roof , a giant bucking bronco in pink neon kicks up its hooves . About three million people pass through the valley each year , most of them in the summer , tourists steering their Winnebagos toward Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks . Jackson caters to them with stagecoach rides and melodrama houses , but in the winter its gaudier attractions go underground , and Jackson becomes a ski town . And not just thanks to Jackson Hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Snow King , rises literally from the edge of town . There 's not much that 's duded-up or overdone about Jackson , and that is one of its strengths . But the area 's greatest assets are natural . The Jackson Hole valley is arguably the most scenically spectacular ski destination in the lower 48 . There is no snarled traffic , no condo blight . It 's a calming environment , a visual Valium for the jaded eye that wants nothing more than to contemplate a copse of aspen and cottonwood hunkered on the banks of the Snake River , or a fence post defining a snowy meadow . This visual grace extends to the ski area itself : You practically have to stand in Teton Village before you can make out the ski trails and lifts , so seamlessly do they meld with the enveloping folds of the mountains . Eli , of course , was too young to fully appreciate such beauty . Okay , so David and I had let our Greenpeace membership lapse . That did n't mean we could n't try to engender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were just deluding ourselves , but it seemed to be working . Eli loved to be outside . He loved to eat snow , to hold it in his hands . The cold wind in his tiny face made him catch his breath in pleasure and surprise . To Eli , winter was n't cold , or inconvenient , or something to shovel off the sidewalk  --  winter was simply new , and that in turn made it new for us . It was time that Eli be exposed to wildlife more exotic than the family cat . So one afternoon we picked him up from the Kids Ranch and headed for the National Elk Refuge , one mile north of town , where you can take a horse-drawn sleigh ride into the heart of the herd . Our sleigh-mates included a British couple , a retired couple festooned with cameras and binoculars , two cowboys , and three skiers who were still wearing their telemark boots . The draft horses moseyed out across the range . Their bobbing heads , the jangling bells , and the driver 's mellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon was windless and mild . Eli sat on David 's lap , placidly sucking on a bright red pacifier . The elk seemed quite unimpressed by our presence . They foraged through the snow and stared at us laconically . An opportunistic coyote skulked at the edge of the herd , waiting for one of the animals to retire to that big elk refuge in the sky . ( Refuge literature refers to such scavengers as " elk disposal units . " ) Across the valley we could see the three famous Teton peaks , jagged and cruel . They were originally known as Les Trois Tetons , which translates , politely , to " three breasts , " so named by French-Canadian fur trappers who obviously had n't gotten any in a while . ( The newer , more politically correct names are Grand , Middle , and South Tetons . ) We marveled at the view , the sheer emptiness of the place , and the bulls ' magnificent racks . The driver was a hotbed of elk trivia : Each spring the elk shed their antlers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auctioned off . There 's quite a market for them in Asia , where they 're used in love potions . The retirees snapped away wildly . After 20 minutes we were among the herd . Suddenly Eli began emitting excited squeals and trying to lunge out of the sleigh toward the shaggy beasts . David , naturally , held him back . Livid , Eli flung his pacifier to the floor of the sleigh , where it bounced once and fell through the slats onto the ground . No , the driver said , we could n't leave the sleigh to retrieve it . " But what if an elk eats it ? " I fretted . One of the cowboys turned , peered out at me from under the brim of his hat , and spoke these eternal words : " Ma'am , all things must pass . " " Tell that to the elk . " But the cowboy was right : All things must pass , including family ski vacations to Jackson Hole . On the morning we were to fly out , seven inches of new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powder runs while David packed up our stuff . I got first tracks on Apres Vous , savoring the sensation of floating , at the same time ruing the fact that we had to leave . But we vowed to return in a few years , when Eli would be old enough to know what Les Trois Tetons means , old enough to hike and camp and fish the Snake . The wildflowers in summer were spectacular , we 'd heard , and Eli would get a kick out of Old Faithful , Yellowstone 's indefatigable geyser . Wyoming had left its mark on us , and our baby boy , in his own small way , had left his mark on Wyoming .. <p>
