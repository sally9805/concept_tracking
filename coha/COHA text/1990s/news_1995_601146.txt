<p> Amsterdam Admirals coach Al Luginbill feels reborn in the World League of American Football . <p> Sacked from San Diego State University in 1993 , Luginbill found himself in the wilderness until he converted to the WLAF last year . <p> " This is unlike anything I have ever done in football , " he says . " I hate to use the term reborn , but I 've got a new lease on life . " <p> The National Football League and joint partner Fox Inc. /Newscorp. hope that the same applies to the WLAF , which launches its second try this weekend . <p> Luginbill 's Admirals host the Barcelona Dragons on Saturday , while the Frankfurt Galaxy welcome the London Monarchs . On Sunday afternoon , the Rhein ( Dusseldorf ) Fire travel to Edinburgh for a clash with the Scottish Claymores . <p> Shut down in 1992 after two seasons and huge financial looses , the WLAF is back with just six European teams , a lean-and-mean budget of $ 40 million for four years and a $ 4 million salary cap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ football to the Europeans . <p> Now the league is stocked with 35 NFL players - including 12 quarterbacks - hungry new coaches such as Luginbill , and 46 nationals . Several team managers also are locals , hefty sums are earmarked for American razzmatazz , and an implicit promise exists that the league is here to stay . <p> " I think you have to be in this for the long term , " says NFL president Neil Austrian . " There 's more financial realism this time . " <p> Last time , the WLAF had 10 teams in North America and Europe and sold franchises to entrepeneurs eager for short-term profits . NFL owners , ABC and USA cable network provided financing . But when a worldwide recession hit and fans in the USA failed to warm up to spring football , the venture collapsed . <p> The NFL also was distracted by labor unrest and the lack of a television contract . With those issues now resolved , the NFL is thinking long term . <p> " We can afford to start investment spending , " Austrian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . " <p> The WLAF is at the heart of that strategy . <p> " You ca n't start a new sports league and expect to make money in the second or even third year , that 's just pie in the sky , " Austrian says . " We think we can make a small profit by the beginning of year five . " <p> Even if the league is a flop this year , Austrian promises it will be back . <p> " We are committed , " he says . " I would n't be ready to pack it in , nor would Fox , based on one year . " <p> But no one is talking flop . <p> " I think we 'll have a sellout in Frankfurt ( this weekend ) , " says WLAF President Marc Lory , where the Galaxy already have sold 7,000 season tickets . Frankfurt 's Waldstadion has 30,000 seats . <p> The Claymores , a preseason favorite out of training camp , are expecting 15,000 , but Lory says that crowds in both Scotland and Amersterdam will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says , " and we have some growing to do in those areas where football is new . " <p> The Monarchs , Dragons and Galaxy formed the European division of the original WLAF and averaged 30,000 in attendance . That gives them an edge over rookie squads the Admirals , Fire and Claymores . But nothing is taken for granted in the WLAF . <p> Expectations are more modest this time . <p> " If we can average ( as a league ) between 15,000-20,000 over the season , I 'll consider it a resounding success , " Austrian says . <p> Lory , 44 , a French marketing whiz with an MBA from the University of Chicago , says he is optimistic about Barcelona 's home opener in Week Two against the Claymores . <p> " They have gotten incredible press covereage , " he says , " but the Spanish are known to buy late , so we will need nerves of steel . " <p> Adds Austrian : " We are trying to build on the strengths of the three teams we had . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oiler quarterback and lawyer Oliver Luck from his job as general manager at Frankfurt to the new Rhein Fire . <p> The Galaxy was the only WLAF franchise to make money in 1992 , but Luck is n't expecting to do that with the Fire . <p> " We are light years ahead because I 've done this before , " he says , " but this is about losing only what we are supposed to lose in year one or two . If I lose less than we project , then I 'm a king . " <p> Luck used fireworks , a posse of Harley bikers and sky divers last time to attract fans to a 10-10 team . That model is now standard for the league . <p> " Our biggest challenge is convincing people who do n't know anything about American football that this will be fun , " Lory says . " We want to mix entertainment and sport . " <p> The Claymores feature a tented village this Sunday with surf riding and bungee running , a barbeque and bagpipers alongside country-and-western bands . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But for those who stay home , Fox is providing NFL-style coverage with 21 hours of WLAF football throughout Europe and 35 hours around the world . In 1991-92 , the WLAF was driven by the demands of U.S. television . Now , local broadcasters are in control , though they are n't generating revenue for the league , just promotion . <p> " We had to build a television foundation for the league , " says George Krieger , Fox Sports executive vice president , " to support each team in its territory and language region . " <p> With government control of television in Europe breaking up and new cable and satellite ventures opening up , Fox sold the WLAF as an emerging product . <p> " Everyone wants to develop new products and sell them to a young audience , " Krieger says , " but still have brand name quality , such as a Fox and a NFL . " <p> The current contracts , which range from Britain 's Sky Sports to Catalan 's regional TV3 , run two years . Eventually , the NFL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will come ultimately from the gate and television , " Austrian says , " but this will be step by step , area by area . " <p> Uncertainty is sure to mark the WLAF this year , both in the executive suite and on the field . Coming out of training camp , the Claymores were picked as a strong early contender , along with the Admirals . But four days before kick-off , the team fired coach Lary Kuharich and elevated offensive coordinator Jim Criner . <p> " It was n't an easy decision to take the job as head coach , " Criner said . " But I do n't think it will affect the team . Their chemistry seems to be coming together at the right time . " <p> Blending the talents of Americans and nationals after only four weeks of practice is the first challenge for all the coaches . By league rules , three of the less experienced local talent must get into at least six plays from scrimmage . London coach Bobby Hammond says he has no problem playing British running back Victor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to play him , " he said . " I think he can make a contribution at any time . " <p> At the Claymores , the traditional rivalry between the Scots and English has bonded the locals to the Americans . " It opened my eyes about how fierce that rivalry is , " says wide receiver Allen DeGraffenreid from the Kansas City Chiefs . " We started getting into their way of thinking . " <p> London and Scotland rumbled during training camp and face each other in Week Five of the season . The WLAF , eager to encourage attendance by stoking national rivalries , picked that week because it could determine a World Bowl contender . Placing a second team in Germany also was part of the strategy . <p> The team with the best record after five weeks gains a slot in the World Bowl and home-field advantage . That encourages a fast start . <p> " We must win our opener , " Hammond says . " I 've told the team that and I did n't mince words . If we want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road . " <p> NFL quarterbacks will help . The Monarchs have the Minnesota Vikings ' Brad Johnson , a friend and rival of Barcelona 's Casey Weldon , when both played at Florida State . " It will be fun facing Brad , " says Weldon , a Tampa Bay Buc , " though I was hoping it would have been in the NFL by now . " <p> Dragons coach Jack Bicknell says the NFL players are raising the quality of competition in the league . " This is a great coaching situation , " he says , " because these kids are all hungry . But I do n't see any giant egos . They 're willing to do whatever you ask them . " <p> Weldon has volunteered as a back-up punter . <p> Bicknell , the winningest coach in WLAF history , returned to Barcelona because he thought the league was serious about staying this time . Jerry Vainisi , the league 's vice president of football operations , is another veteran from 1991-92 . <p> " Every year we were trying to decide whether we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Now there is no question , and what we ca n't correct this year we 'll correct next year . "
