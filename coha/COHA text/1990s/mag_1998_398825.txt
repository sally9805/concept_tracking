Section : THE Pastel PAGE <p> The lone figure on the windswept prairie is a uniquely American image , a symbol of pride , hard work , and place that has defined our heritage . In his pastel paintings , M.L. Moseman celebrates the heroes of the Midwestern plains and preserves a piece of American history slowly disappearing from the landscape . <p> Moseman grew up on a farm in Oakland , Nebraska , and came to appreciate the hardworking , self-reliant ethic of people who share a profound , almost spiritual connection to the land . His pastel paintings depict an ephemeral quality of contemporary farm life , dramatizing the relationship between people and nature , while expressing his own strong sense of values . <p> " As an artist , " he says , " I feel I do my most rewarding work when I am able to interpret my subject . To make a strong interpretation , I must paint what has become a part of me  --  my point of view on the vanishing farm and ranch workers who truly care for the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep their spirit alive . " <p> Three centrally important elements dominate Moseman 's compositions  --  the figure , the land , and the sky . Together , this subject matter could easily become nostalgic , even romanticized , but his matter-of-fact renderings share a strikingly unsentimental attitude . <p> In Sentinel , for example , the artist centers the figure to achieve a powerful pose and frames the picture from a lowered perspective , so the viewer must look up to the subject . Moseman often makes use of this unconventional point of view in his paintings . Generally , figures extend above the horizon line into the sunlit sky , while the viewer 's eye level is fixed around the figure 's knees . Compositionally , it reinforces his idea of his work as a monument to his heroes . <p> " In an effort to capture the spirit of a hero , I instinctively expanded the sky and hillcrest to the left and right , " he explains . " The tree and shadow were used as asymmetrical counterpoints to the figure . " The artist even selected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentimentality . <p> Moseman often draws directly with one or two pastels . For Sentinel , once the pastel was laid down , he used a Sakura pastel brush to " dry wash " areas of the image . Using both the flat and edge areas of the brush , he established the values for the composition . After he is satisfied with the drawing , he then turns his attention to color . " For color balance , I used a hot red jacket in a field of cool blue sky , and cool blue jeans in a field of warm autumn grasses . Light reflections among these elements allowed me to unify the painting with local hot and cool colors . " <p> For works smaller than 18 " x 24 " , Moseman uses unmounted paper . For larger paintings , he draws the composition on a more rigid surface . The artist prefers Hahnemuhle paper mounted on four-ply museum board . <p> " The paper surface lets me achieve effects especially suitable to my choice of subject matter , " he says . " In Stalking Insects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizon with my finger . I wanted to dull the color as it was smoothed and pressed into the paper . I have not been able to get this exact effect on other surfaces . I achieved field depth when I combined the fine grain with more vivid color and strokes in the foreground . I also like the paper for blending some of the subtle features of the skies that frame many of my figures . As uncluttered crop land , pastures , and big skies are characteristic of my work , I have adopted a selective use of finger blending . " <p> On field trips , Moseman uses a few Conte crayons or hard pastels for color notes , but generally he needs photographs to capture " the proud , natural movements of my people in their own environment . " To catch the fleeting moments , he uses an auto-wind , point-and-shoot camera . For example , when he prepared reference material for the painting Generations , several rolls of film yielded only six useful photos . <p> " In my studio , I take a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pasted the photographs to arrange the composition . Then I studied the figures . I used my father as the model for the two closest figures . I took 3 0 years off his age to depict the man on the right . In rearranging the figures , I also had to relocate highlights and shadows to make the light source consistent on all of the figures in my frame of view . I use a wooden mannequin in the studio to model poses . For these studies , I used a Berol 350 Electronic Scorer pencil . I can wash this particular lead with Turpenoid , leaving a good surface for later layers of pastel . Using a variety of brushes , I refined the drawing and established area values . I studied my work upside down , sideways , and with a mirror to make sure the drawing was also a strong abstract composition . " <p> All the figures in Moseman 's paintings are defenders of their beloved land . They work to keep it well , and so reflect the artist 's own value structure . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life that is connected and rooted to the very land Moseman has set out to celebrate . <p> Expressing his point of view enables Moseman to make successful advances in his pastel work . For Last Weevil , again he envisioned the farmers in a spiritual bond with the land . " Most of the finished painting is the cool greens and blues of the grass , sky , and work clothes . For temperature balance and a mysterious feeling , I wanted a very hot color to glow through from below . As this was not available on commercial papers , I improvised . I applied a cadmium red on a cream paper using the side of a hard pastel stick , and ' melted ' it into the paper with Turpenoid . This produced a warm sparkle that comes through the cool surface colors of the finished painting . It also heats the skin tones in the manner of the sun in an open field . " <p> Because the artist 's vision of the agrarian worker results in many similar paintings , this underpainting technique has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual depicted in the painting Solitude 's Sentry , who seems watchful and alert with her staff  --  a warrior defending the homesteader 's way of life  --  Moseman as both the artist and the man is a protector of the land . <p> " For me , " he explains , " the vision and technique drive my development , but the vision comes first . As long as I am willing to take risks and explore that vision , choices in technique and materials become apparent . When I am honest about my subject matter , nurture it , and let it evolve and change , in my experience , my facility with pastels expands with my growth as an artist . " <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : M.L.
