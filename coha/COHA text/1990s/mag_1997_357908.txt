Less growth . More inflation . Corporate profits rising only about half as fast . <P> That may sound like a dismal forecast for next year  --  and in another era it would be . In making these predictions , however , members of a specially convened TIME Board of Economists are bubbling with optimism . In 1998 , they think , the U.S. will enjoy a stunning sixth straight year of steady growth , relatively stable prices and low unemployment . Yes , the performance will be less spectacular than this year 's  --  but then 1997 has been a vintage year . By almost any other comparison , 1998 should be more than satisfactory . <P> " Fundamentally , the economy is in remarkable shape , " says Martin Zimmerman , director of corporate economics for Ford Motor Co . Allen Sinai , chief global economist of Primark Decision Economics , goes further : " It 's terrific . Having a combination of good times on Main Street and Wall Street for so long is rare . This may be the only time in history . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency crises in Southeast Asia that have thrown economies and financial markets into chaos . Though the 7% break in the U.S. stock market on Oct. 27 was " a greatly exaggerated reaction , " in the words of Robert Hormats , vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International , the turmoil will hurt American exports and the profits of U.S. companies heavily invested there . But strong growth at home and in other big U.S. markets  --  Canada , Mexico and Europe  --  should offset much of the damage . <P> Even so , board members agree that forecasts of U.S. output next year need to be lowered half a percentage point or so . Post-Asia , Carl Weinberg , chief international economist of High Frequency Economics , a market and economic analytical firm , foresees a 2.5% rise in gross domestic product , down from 3.6% this year but near the pace many economists think can be sustained year after year . He expects inflation to creep up  --  but from only 2.3% to 2.8% . <P> Weinberg thinks that by the end of 1998 unemployment may rise to 5.2% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 24-year low of 4.7% , registered in October . Either way , labor markets will remain very tight , and that affects almost every aspect of the outlook for next year . <P> Production will grow more slowly , says Zimmerman , in part because " we 're running out of labor . " The shortage will also push up wages . Weinberg hopes that much of the increase can be offset by higher productivity resulting from the heavy business investment of recent years ( business spending on new plant and equipment has been shooting up 18% a year ) . Nonetheless , prices will be forced up at a slightly faster rate than in 1997 . <P> Hot competition , though , usually prevents big price increases . So higher wages will cut into corporate profits . Hormats believes companies also will have to spend more on training programs for any additional workers they hire . Even so , Sinai predicts an 8% gain in corporate profits next year . That would be about half the extraordinary 1997 increase but still a robust addition to already record sums . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
