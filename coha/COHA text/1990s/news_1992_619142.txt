<p> TAKING OVER a radio station is always part heaven , part hell . It can be quite euphoric putting a station on the air . But new ownership almost always involves changing personnel , and separations  --  especially in tough times  --  breed ill feelings . <p> And so it is that the new management of First Broadcasting , having purchased KSFO and KYA from King Broadcasting of Seattle , finds itself being labeled cold and downright cruel , and the dismissals the new people in charge have made since taking over late last month have been depicted as some kind of a massacre . <p> General manager Ed Krampf , formerly of " Live 105 , " is , in fact , a sensitive young executive ( he 's 39 ) , and he hastens to make a few points about the situation . <p> First , what happened : Disc jockeys John Mack Flanagan , Sylvia Chacon , Scott Forrest and Steve Garland lost their jobs , along with news reporters Ginny Prior , Ravi Peruman and Larry Brownell ( who 'd been a fixture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50s ) . Many behind-the-scenes people were let go as well . <p> Why it happened , Krampf said , has little to do with what 's appeared in the papers , including claims that First Broadcasting ( owned by Ron Unkefer , who 's also CEO of the Good Guys chain ) was intent on busting the employees ' unions and that the KSFO half of the operation might be changing formats . <p> KSFO/KYA will " unequivocally " remain an oldies station , Krampf said . ( KSFO maintains its ties to the A 's and Ron Barr 's sports-talk show . ) As for the union , Krampf said that employees are " very well-compensated . . . and if they 're unhappy , they can vote to bring in a union . " <p> But here 's his main point : " King Broadcasting , " he said of the previous owner , " is the one who decided to fire these people , by selling the station . When you put down $ 13 million for a station , I think you have the right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes were made primarily to get " the best product , " he said . Terry McGovern , who began in Bay Area radio at KSFO in 1969 , is back on afternoons , replacing Flanagan 's classic Top 40 punch with offbeat humor and a more adult personality . " That was a no-brainer , " Krampf said . " Our environment suits him perfectly . " Chacon , Forrest and Garland lost out either because of low ratings or because Krampf or program director Dave Anthony had people they wanted to bring in . Roger Cary , late of KEZR in San Jose , does an expanded evening shift , and Steve Theroux , who worked with Krampf at a station in Ventura , takes Garland 's all-night show . <p> Survivors include Gene Nelson and Celeste Perry . Nelson 's morning show , however , lost news co-anchor Prior . " That was a cost situation , " Krampf said , praising Prior as well as the other departed reporters . " In the morning , they had two newscasters and John Madden , " Krampf said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " makes more than many notable morning personalities . Something had to go . " And something did . <p> MORE CH-CH-CH-CHANGES <p> KSOL , now calling itself " Wild 107 , " scuttled the morning team of Ron Engelman , Mark Gunn and Kelly Fox . In are Erich " Mancow " Muller and " Double D " from KDON in Monterey-Salinas . Along with Gunn and Fox , Engelman , former partner with John London on KMEL , was expected to put a dent into KMEL 's morning show after London left last spring . But , while KMEL 's ratings did drop , KSOL 's own numbers stayed flat . Engelman blamed management 's lack of marketing and promotion . " Everybody else is on TV , and all we got were bus signs , " he said . KSOL boss Scott Fey said ratings were only part of the problem . At KMEL , he noted , " people talked about London ; the bits ; the energy . A morning show should lead with street talk ; a vibe . We did n't sense a street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " <p> Sadness all around at " Double 99 , " where general manager Paul Wielinsky has resigned after learning that he had tested positive for HIV , the virus that causes AIDS . Wielinsky left , said PD Jim Herron , to reduce stress  --  " and he wants to devote his energies to helping in AIDS awareness " . . . K101 program director Bobby Cole , who rose from PD to VP of programming at Fairmont Communications , is out after " failing to come to terms " with management , as he put it . Cole has started a consultancy business out of Mill Valley . With Fairmont 's stations , Cole worked with adult-contemporary , Top 40 , classic rock and news-talk formats . . . Bob Hamilton , dismissed as program director at KSFO/KYA , also dived into the jungles of radio consultancy . . . Pat Evans , PD at KFOG , resigned after nearly three mostly futile years . No word yet on an Evans consultancy . Greg Solk is in from Chicago . . . KOIT , doing the cost-trimming thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " preparing for the ' 90s " ) , laid off one of the best-named DJs in town : Jack Friday . His afternoon slot went to evening announcer Dave Anderson , who does five hours live , then another four by way of taped liners mixed with music by an engineer . . . <p> KKHI has brought back Dianne Nicolini , who left her noon-to-6 p.m. shift last fall to devote more time to her family and other interests . " We heard from a lot of people who missed her , " said KKHI 's Marita Dorenbecher . Nicolini agreed to a two-hour slot : " Dinner Concert " from 6 to 8 p.m . . . . Mark Ibanez , the KTVU sports anchor who lost his job hosting KNBR 's " Sportspage 68 " despite fine ratings , is back on the radio , filling in for Mike Shumann on KFOG while " the Shu " roams the sidelines at Warriors TV games . . . Steve O'Shea has exited KTID and , after a career including KFRC in the mid- ' 60s , he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stefan Ponek , a DJ and PD at KSAN in its " Jive 95 " days , is new general manager at KNBA , the country outlet in Vallejo . . . In Sacramento , longtime album-rocker KZAP ditched its format and headed for the country , as in country and western . The entire DJ lineup was sent packing . <p> Rantings &; Ratings <p> The latest pile of numbers from Arbitron , for last fall ( October-December ) , was boffo for the news stations , but for many others , the news was bad . In the overall ratings ( for listeners 12 and older ) , KOIT and its new light-rock rival KABL both did well , and " Live 105 " entrenched itself as the top-rated rock-and-roll station , while both KRQR and KFOG took serious dips , as did " Magic 61 , " " Double 99 , " K101 and both baseball-related stations , KNBR and KSFO . <p> The top dozen , with their percentage share of the overall audience ( and , in parentheses , their summer ratings ) , are KGO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , KMEL 5.3 ( 5.3 ) , KFRC-AM ( " Magic 61 " ) 4.3 ( 4.9 ) , KOIT 3.6 ( 3.0 ) , KNBR 3.3 ( 4.5 ) , KSFO/KYA 3.2 ( 3.8 ) , KITS ( " Live 105 " ) 3.1 ( 2.7 ) , KABL 3.0 ( 2.7 ) , KSAN 2.9 ( 2.5 ) , KSOL 2.9 ( 2.8 ) , K101 2.7 ( 3.2 ) and KKSF 2.5 ( 2.7 ) . <p> KDFC outpointed KKHI , 2.3 to 1.6 , KBLX also had a 2.3 and KBRG impressed with a 2.1 , while new Spanish music station KOFY , in transition from oldies , was at the bottom of the pile with .7 . KRQR fell from 2.8 to 2.2 , while KFOG plummeted from 2.3 to a 1.6 , below San Jose 's KOME and KSJO ( 1.8 each ) . " Double 99 's " two stations combined for a troubled 1.2 . Easy-listening KBAY scored a solid 2.3 out of the South Bay . Oldies KFRC-FM slipped from 2.3 to 1.8 . KNEW had 1.2 ; KJAZ and KUFX had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the top five were KGO ( 9.6 ) , KCBS ( 8.6 ) , KMEL ( 4.8 ) , KSFO/KYA ( 4.4 ) and KNBR ( 4.0 ) , trailed by KITS ( 3.0 ) , KSAN ( 2.8 ) , KABL ( 2.7 ) , K101 ( 2.6 ) and KSOL ( 2.5 ) . <p> SO LONG <p> Finally , having detailed everyone else 's ch-ch-ch-changes , " Radio Waves " is waving farewell for a while ( another book project beckons ) . I hope to write again soon .
