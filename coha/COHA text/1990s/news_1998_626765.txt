<p> Consider the story of Jose Antonio Navarro , who was born in 1795 after his parents had moved from Mexico City to Texas . <p> As a supporter of Texas independence , Navarro signed the Texas Declaration of Independence and later , after annexation , helped draft the state constitution . He won a seat in the state Senate , and when Texas seceded , all four of his sons fought for the Confederacy . <p> Consider , too , the story of Henrick Arnold , a free black man who fought for Texas independence . In 1835 , when Ben Milam ordered an attack on San Antonio , one group refused to obey the order until Arnold could return from a scouting trip to lead them . <p> Arnold and Navarro clearly made their mark in Texas history . And thousands of Texas seventh-graders read about them every year in one of the state-adopted books called " Texas and Texans . " <p> But past generations of Texas middle school students likely did n't encounter the stories of Navarro and Arnold . In fact , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach to textbooks , many people recall Texas history lessons from a very different perspective . <p> Many , in fact , grew up reading a cartoon version of the state 's history in a book called " Texas History Movies " that was published in paperback by Magnolia Petroleum Co. and distributed widely throughout the schools . <p> " That is probably the most influential book on Texas ever done , " said Ron Tyler , director of the Texas State Historical Association . " You talk to anybody who is 40 or 50 years old , and chances are if they went to school in Texas , they read that book . " <p> What made the book especially memorable for some was its use of popular slang and its tendency toward stereotypes , particularly when referring to blacks , Hispanics and American Indians . <p> One cartoon , for example , depicted a Mexican man , wearing a sombrero and serape , passing an Uncle Sam look-alike on the street . Beneath the overline that reads " There was the age-old prejudice of race , " the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In yet another cartoon , two colonists are trying to read a sign that has been posted in Spanish by the ruling Mexican government . " What does it say ? " one of the men asks . " How should I know ? " replies the other . " I do n't read chile con carne . " <p> Magnolia 's successor , the Socony-Mobil Oil Co. , stopped publishing the cartoons in the late 1950s , and in 1961 , the copyright was passed on to the historical association . <p> The association , noting that the cartoon history lesson still had potential as a valuable educational tool , printed a revised version of the book in 1974 after a multi-ethnic committee of teachers reviewed the cartoons and removed the ones that were considered offensive or in bad taste . <p> " Obviously in its original condition , it was not suitable for use in the public schools today , " Tyler said . <p> The Houston Chronicle printed the revised edition , which was renamed " Texas History Illustrated , " and the book was made available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history book underscores the dramatic changes that have taken place in the Texas history curriculum , which is required in the fourth and seventh grades . <p> " It 's not an overt change , " said Sharon Pope , coordinator of social studies in the Spring Branch schools . " It 's just an evolutionary change not only based on the sensitivity to our student population but just the realities of the scholarship and the research of Texas history . " <p> In many of the early texts written before 1960 , Mexicans for the most part were depicted as the enemy , American Indians were commonly referred to as " savages " and blacks and women were rarely mentioned . <p> " It was clear that racial stereotypes permeated the textbooks written really on all levels , I would argue , all the way through the 1950s , " said Don Carleton , history professor at the University of Texas . <p> The civil rights movement and the women 's movement that swept the country in the 1960s greatly influenced the textbook industry , and today 's books mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new textbooks are more bland and written to prescription than they once were , others argue that the new multicultural approach provides students with a far more rounded view of their state 's historical past . <p> " Our new textbooks are much more representative of a Texas history that takes into account the roles , the contributions of the various groups that make up Texas , " said Armando C. Alonzo , associate professor of history at Texas A &M; University . " There is no question about that . We 've gone a long way . " <p> Early textbooks focused heavily on battles and bravery . Colorful imagery was used to describe the valor of Texas forefathers who fought to the death against the Mexican dictator , Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna . <p> Anna J.H. Pennybacker wrote a " History of Texas for Schools " that originally was published in the 1880s and frequently revised . <p> In a section on the Alamo , the book reads like a fast-paced action novel : " The Mexicans were pushed forward over the bodies of their dead comrades . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( William Barret ) Travis fell , now ( James Butler ) Bonham . The enemies were in the court . The Texans were literally cut to pieces , yet not one fell unavenged . <p> " Brave ( David ) Crockett left a score of bodies about him to show his work . The gallant ( James ) Bowie , though too weak to rise from his bed , shot two fiends who were preparing to butcher him . The court ran with blood , but the conflict did not cease until every one of the noble band lay a bleeding sacrifice upon his country 's altar . " <p> Historical facts , too , are more likely to be questioned in the latest books . For example , many of the early Texas history textbooks presented as fact the classic story of Travis drawing a line in the sand with his sword and asking those who chose to die with him to step across it . <p> Many historians have doubted the truth of that story , which supposedly was told by Louis ( Moses ) Rose , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and returned to his East Texas home . <p> " Texas and Texans , " the most common seventh-grade Texas history book now used in the state , argues under the heading " Fact or Legend ? " that it does n't really matter whether it happened or not . <p> " The important fact is that more than 180 men chose to defend the Alamo for a cause in which they believed even though doing so might mean their death , " the book reads . <p> Lamar University history professor Adrian Anderson , one of the book 's authors , said that historians are always searching for the facts and trying to present as accurate a story as they can . <p> " We have no pretense that we have all the answers , " he said . <p> Certainly , more research is being done today . A new group of Texas historians is even focusing its research on aspects of history that some say have been ignored in the past . <p> These historians , called revisionists , are more interested in the social and cultural issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that dominated the works of earlier historians . <p> David Anderson , the Texas Education Agency 's coordinator for curriculum and professional development , said the better-selling textbooks now focus more on the day-to-day lives of the common Texans - who they were , how they lived and what they accomplished . <p> " By doing that , " Anderson said , " publishers have an opportunity to bring in people who might not have shown up in that old approach to history .
