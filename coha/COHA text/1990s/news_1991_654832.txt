<p> ' CITIZEN KANE , " due tomorrow for a 50th-anniversary revival , was a box-office disappointment in 1941 , launching Orson Welles 's reputation as a filmmaker too bold and inventive for his own good . <p> " Kane " has gathered momentum ever since , however , becoming a staple of revival theaters , classrooms , and on television , with its story of a newspaper tycoon who becomes an American legend at the expense of his own soul . <p> To mark its half-century celebration , I asked a dozen film experts for brief comments on the film . The results were predictably unpredictable . <p> Fred Camper , writer and lecturer on film and art , Chicago : <p> " Citizen Kane " is a superb film . It is also the worst film of a great cineaste , as Welles himself wrote of Eisenstein 's " Ivan the Terrible . " " Kane 's " technique , while brilliant , and beautifully expressive of its theme of individual grandiosity , is far less profound , far less unified , than the style of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Kane " is very much a young man 's film , a film of stunning moments , which coheres more thematically than visually . In later Welles , every area of the screen , each part of each image , vibrates with an intense physicality that speaks , almost musically , to every other part of every other image . " Citizen Kane " is a personality ; a later Welles film is a universe . <p> Ray Carney , professor of film and American studies , Boston University : <p> Melodramatic mumbo-jumbo . Exuberant , gorgeous nonsense . Fun ? Of course . A profound work of art ? Hardly . It takes more than bombastic rhetoric , gaudy visuals , and scenery-chewing performances to make a masterpiece . <p> " Kane " is an all-American triumph of style over substance . Welles is Kane - in a sense he could n't have intended - substituting razzle-dazzle for truth and hoping no one notices the sleight of hand . The movie is indistinguishable from the opera production within it : attempting to conceal the banality of its performances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visual processing . <p> Critics obviously enjoy being told what to think or they 'd never sit still for the hammy acting , cartoon characterizations , tendentious photography , editorializing blockings , and absurdly grandiose ( and annoyingly insistent ) metaphors . My personal nominee ( along with " Psycho " and " 2001 " ) for " one of the 10 most overrated films of all time . " When will film studies grow up ? Even Jedediah Leland ( opera reviewer in the film ) knew better than to be taken in by " Salaambo 's " empty reverberations . <p> Annette Insdorf , film professor and department co-chair , Columbia University : <p> " Citizen Kane " remains one of the richest audiovisual experiences in the history of the cinema . The expressive sound track - including music by master Bernard Herrmann - led Francois Truffaut to call it " a radiophonic film , " while the cinematography by Gregg Toland was literally groundbreaking : In order to shoot an extreme low-angle shot of Welles and Joseph Cotten , they had to make a hole in the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film narrative , telling the story not only via plot and dialogue , but composition , camera angle , and a heady mix of visual styles . <p> Its influence - especially of narrative structure rooted in flashbacks - has been pervasive . As Truffaut 's " Day for Night " beautifully demonstrates in a dream sequence - where a boy steals pictures of Welles 's film from the front of a movie house at night , with organ music rising on the sound track as he runs away - " Citizen Kane " is a film to worship . <p> Wendy Keys , executive producer/programming , Film Society of Lincoln Center , New York : <p> My most recent experience with " Citizen Kane " - which is one of those rare films that you do n't watch but experience again and again - was when I presented a dissection of the film by ( critic ) Andrew Sarris for a group of New York City schoolteachers who gather each summer at Lincoln Center . <p> After showing the film in its entirety , Andrew spent three days taking it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every angle . The remarkable thing was that after this intensive scrutiny and after a second viewing the film retained all its original mystery and power - much to the astonishment of the teachers themselves . <p> And like Everett Sloane who , in the film , tells the poignant story of an unknown woman in a white dress drifting by him on a ferry many years earlier and his daily thoughts of her - I , too , reminisce fondly about my experiences with the film , sometimes shared , sometimes not . <p> Phillip Lopate , essayist and novelist , New York : <p> I first saw " Citizen Kane " on TV , cut up by commercials but still impressive , when I was in high school ; I 've seen it several times since in revival houses . From the first the film seemed to me a bit chilly , hollow , the parts greater than the whole . But what parts ! - so inventive and pleasurable to look at moment-by-moment . <p> I was fascinated by all those first-person narrators , especially Joseph Cotten . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male friendship ( still am ) , and I think I identified with both parts of the Cotten-Welles relationship ( later repeated in " The Third Man " ) : that of an essentially civilized , prudent guy who envies his flamboyant and rule-flaunting pal . The handling of the Cotten narrator in " Citizen Kane " is extremely literary . For the first time ( in my experience ) , a subjective first-person narration , highly partial and possibly distorted , was being insinuated over the ostensibly objective photographic record . While still in college I made a film that tried to cram three unreliable narrators into 20 minutes ! Hopelessly muddled . I guess I was trying to do " Citizen Kane . " <p> Vlada Petric , professor of cinema and curator of the Harvard Film Archive , Harvard University : <p> " Citizen Kane " is one of those films that perfectly demonstrate what a truly cinematic achievement means : Watching it without the sound generates the impact of a glorious " optical symphony " ; listening only to its sound track stimulates extremely dynamic visual imagery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directorial remarks on the text 's margin ) confirms that it stops short of describing in literary terms what one experiences while perceiving the film in the movie theater ; and seeing it on a TV screen ( the bigger the worse ) is like trying to aesthetically appreciate Rembrandt 's paintings reproduced in the newspaper . <p> Lucille Rhodes , filmmaker and film professor , Long Island University : <p> After 15 years of teaching " Citizen Kane , " I can barely utter the word " rosebud " and patently refuse to discuss its meaning . <p> Sometimes I show it next to its opposite , De Sica 's " The Bicycle Thief , " a ' 40s work which hides its artistry in the cause of realism and meaning . Then I have to bite my lip and listen while my freshmen insist that Welles is the greater artist . However , I have to admit that every once in a while I get trapped in the screening room and ca n't avert my eyes - and then I am again seduced by the sheer bravura and grandiosity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sonbert , filmmaker , San Francisco : <p> " Citizen Kane " made film originality viable : Never before had narrative structure been rendered so flexible yet so resonant . Self-conscious art now entered American cinema . The deliberately scratched and faded imagery of " Citizen Kane 's " opening faux-documentary montage remains to this day dazzling in its power and bravura . The lack of heroic-character focus embraces shifting points of view and enchants the viewer with the freshness of its investigative rigor . <p> Armond White , arts editor , ( New York ) City Sun : <p> It 's the greatest American movie about seeing . But the clue gets lost on TV . The big screen yields Welles 's slyest in-joke , where he dissolves from a last close-up of Susan Alexander , repeating the image of her left eye in a stained-glass window at Xanadu . The shot is a gift ; Welles 's knowing wink to film lovers everywhere . Watch for it .
