For years , Trek was singularly devoted to a unified-rear-triangle rear-suspension design , which is ideally suited to cross-country use , but less adept at shredding the downhills . So for ' 99 , the company introduces a line of " VRX " linkage-style bikes that provide increased travel and plushness . The VRX 300 offers three shock mounting positions ( cross country , downhill , and inbetween ) to terrain .
