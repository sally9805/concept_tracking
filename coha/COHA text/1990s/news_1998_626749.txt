<p> The snook is the best light-tackle fish in saltwater . There , I 've said it . <p> Speckled trout are too small and tarpon are too large . Redfish are too grumpy and striped bass are too cold . Bonefish and permit are too specialized . Snook are dead-solid perfect . <p> The common snook ranges across Latin latitudes , reaching to Florida and extreme South Texas , and averages 5 to 15 pounds . Fish topping 20 are not unusual . <p> It is a voracious ambush-type feeder that will strike on or near the surface , excellent game for plug and fly tackle . <p> The snook fights well , often combining fast runs and strong dives with head-shaking leaps , all you could ask from a sport fish . <p> And , for better or worse , the snook is an excellent food fish . Travel south amid swaying palms , and a platter of fresh snook and black beans and rice is " high kitchen , " as good as it gets . <p> But , more than all that , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a snook with its long mouth and gleaming sides and big fins and you know you are facing mayhem in the mangroves . <p> No question - this is a head-hunter , a killer , a fish with an attitude . <p> The biggest problem with snook is that there are not enough of them . For all of its swashbuckling aura , the robalo is a fragile fish . Across the southern map , without exception , the inshore schools are vulnerable to pollution and population . <p> Consistent snook fishing is perhaps the hardest of all saltwater angling to find ; that certainly has been my experience during 25 years of chasing tropical tides - one here , a few there , rare highlights amid desperate campaigns on lagoons , rivers and beaches . <p> But chasing snook often leads to wild and wonderful places . <p> The top snook session of my career occurred last June with Link Smith , Mike Wertz and Baron Neelley in the Ten Thousand Islands region of southwest Florida ; indeed , Florida probably hosts the finest accessible snook fishing in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coastal conservation and water quality . <p> The first day , while wading and casting topwater plugs and shallow-running spoons , I landed and released 11 snook . The fish weighed between eight and 16 pounds . I missed several other strikes , including one huge " blow up " from a 20-plus . <p> Wading clear flats and chunking floaters to big snook - that 's it , where do you go from there with a casting rod ? <p> The big day also provided a big scare . During the late afternoon , with the Everglades ' tide running across the shell and grass , I started to wade across a chest-deep channel . <p> Guide Jim Conley had cautioned against wading too deep - big sharks sometimes cruise the small keys . A mighty boil of mud and grass bloomed ahead of a tentative step . Several hundred pounds of something dark and thick and dreadful was right there . <p> A ponderous manatee lumbered past , rocking a wake . Manatees are harmless and retiring creatures , but the spooked beast was flustered and confused . Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best snook trip of my life and I 'm about to be run over by a deranged sea cow . <p> The manatee found the channel and scooted like a tubby submarine for deeper water . I scrabbled back to knee-deep water ; it somehow was fitting that snook would lead to such a bizarre encounter . <p> The unusual is usual with the not-so-common common snook . The Caribbean side of Costa Rica is one of the best places to catch a trophy-class robalo on light tackle . <p> During late summer and early fall , when the big sows run the beach to spawn , you can stand in the foam and swing for the fences with a heavy bucktail jig . <p> The average surf-runner off the Rio Parismina or the Rio Colorado is in the 15- to 25-pound class , but now and then somebody sticks a 35 or 45 pounder . <p> The fishing seldom is fast ; you might throw your arm off for one or two strikes , but the payoff can be a snook beyond conceptual limits . <p> The surf fishing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mid ' 80s , when I fished often with John Kollman of Parismina Tarpon Rancho , the locals would give a big send-off at the rickety dock . <p> Among these well-wishers was a shriveled old woman with a toothless smile and a squinty stare . She was whispered to be a machuda , a voodoo witch , and it was considered big medicine to have her backing your efforts . <p> Magic ( and I have no preference or prejudice as to color ) can be a strong ally in snook fishing , so I courted the old woman 's blessings on the dock . Less than 30 minutes into our session , a titanic snook struck . <p> A great yellow and silver head shook from the rolling foam - 30-plus , no doubt . Maybe close to 40 . The fish ran up and down the beach , wallowing and churning , as a cluster of cheering fishermen gathered . <p> Then , right in the tidewash , moments from victory , the miserable hook pulled . One instant , my snook-of-a-lifetime was almost close enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I cursed the rod , the reel , the lure and , most certainly and emphatically , the treacherous old woman . The shrill epithets caused several villagers standing nearby to walk away muttering . <p> Pods of snook were roaming the rolling surf and our group of four finished with 9 fish , an exceptional catch . I landed a pair , one weighing 22 pounds , the other a " snake " of about six pounds . <p> The 22 pounder did a lot for my spirits ; you can not look at the glowing yellow and green and silver hulk of a 22-pound snook in the morning light on a wild Costa Rican beach without starting to feel pretty good about things in general . <p> Back at the dock , the old woman hovered close , waiting for her tribute ; it was customary for successful anglers to give her a fish . She was eying my prime 22 pounder . <p> " No way , " I said to Kollman and handed the witch the puny , faded six pounder . The old woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proffered token and stalked away while hissing oily oaths . <p> Surely it was only coincidental that it rained and stormed for three days and we never saw another snook . <p> The largest snook that I 've brought to hand weighed somewhere between 25 and 30 pounds , released unweighed . <p> I was in a skiff casting with Dial Dunkin along the mangrove shoreline of a Yucatan lagoon . I saw the fish - thought it was a small tarpon - and dropped a big Jerkin ' Sam topwater bait ahead of its nose . The fish struck with a loud and lunging clop and the black lateral line was unmistakable . <p> The fish steered to open water and jumped four times . Each was a grand full-body leap that carried high and twisting above the black water . <p> You do n't get a better jump in all of fishing than a big snook with a big plug jammed sideways in its maw . It 's combat fishing . Jumps tired heavy snook quickly , and within a few minutes the beaten fish was on its side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and twisted the gang hooks free , and watched the robalo waddle back under the mangroves . I now regret not having a good photograph but perhaps someday I 'll catch a bigger one . <p> I 'll certainly keep trying . Snook are a lifelong obsession , and a bona fide Bad Boy on a casting rod now and then goes a long way . <p> Several years ago , a fishing acquaintance was planning his honeymoon to a secluded Mexican port . <p> When he heard that the lagoon behind the hotel was rumored to hold big robalo , he began modifying his luggage to include a travel rod and a " stash " of killer plugs . <p> He reckoned to be prepared lest the wallowing of hog snook feeding in the moonlight disrupt his nuptials . <p> " I do n't think she 'll go for this , but I ca n't help it , " he confided . " She can come fishing with me , or she can sit in the room , or she can run off with Romero the bullfighter . All I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snook ! "
