SKI SWAPS HAVE GROWN UP . THESE DAYS , YOU CAN FIND TRULY GREAT GEAR AT OBSCENELY LOW PRICES . BY ISEULT DEVLIN // For years , I avoided swaps because they seemed full of rusty skis and musty clothing best suited for the dumpster . But promises of barely used skis at half price and new parkas for under $100 sent me in search of the Easts best ski swaps . Times have changed . At a swap held at Okemo Mountain last November , my husband bought a pair of Salomon demo skis with Marker bindings in near-perfect condition for $175 . He had demoed a pair of the same model in Aspen three years prior and had had the " ski day of his life . " And while shaped skis were not dominant at the swap , there were quite a few , including a neverused , one-season-old pair of Elan SCX 's for $199 . Never-used , season-old Salomon Axendos and Salomon 9200 Equipes , were priced at $299 . Apparel deals for kids included new name-brand parkas for $39 to $59 from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New adult picks ranged from a Boulder Gear women 's jacket for $79 to an Obermeyer parka for $85 . For $80 , I picked up a beautiful Phenix ski jacket loaded with technical features as a present for mv mother . Every swap has its own unique personality . Most are organized to benefit a charity , school , or local racing team . Washington , D.C 's National Ski and Snowboard Expo , for example , features a huge swap that raises money for the Virginia Special Olympics Winter Games . Some swaps now take credit cards , and most take checks . If you want to get rid of your own gear , most swaps will accept it on a consignment basis and offer you most of the proceedsusually between 75 and 90 percent . Established swaps have experienced organizers who check equipment and clothing to make sure it 's not outdated . This November , I want to try the Bedford , New Hampshire , swap . " We try not to price people out of the market , " says organizer Pam Love . SA lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get stuff new at 50 percent off . " So the Bedford swap has guidelines for suggested prices . Love said good jackets range from $10 to $50 and skis average $60 to $90 , although some may be as low as $25 or as high as $200 . If I do go , I 'll have to get up early-the line to get in starts forming at 6 A.M. , and by the time the door opens , there are hundreds of bargain hunters waiting . Sounds like a good one to me .
