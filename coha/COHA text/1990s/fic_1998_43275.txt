Mrs. Willoughby woke , because of an insinuating pressure on her thigh . Hearing her stir on the other side of the thin wall that separated her room from mine , I went to her . " My sleep was disturbed , " she said . " By someone who entered through the French windows without invitation and stoodthere , at the foot of the bed . He stood a long time , watching me sleep , with his hand clutching my thigh . Do n't ask me how I know . " <p> " Perhaps you dreamed it , " I suggested . <p> She lifted her nightdress so that I might regard five small bruises on an otherwise immaculate leg . <p> I regarded them gladly . <p> " One does n't expect a nightmare mauling to leave marks ! " she replied tartly . <p> " Was any further harm done you ? " I asked , turning away to conceal my anxiety . <p> She was silent a moment , taking stock . Out in Kilindini Harbor , a hippo snorted . A hyena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sighed , " It is always so when Mr. Willoughby is out seeing to his affairs . " <p> Mr. Willoughby managed the Uganda railroad . I considered placing my hand on Mrs. Willoughby 's thigh in his absence , but did n't . <p> " And what of Lenin ? " I asked instead . <p> She regarded her bruises , then said , " It has been weeks since I 've had him in my bed . " <p> I cleared my throat meaningfully . <p> " Oh , Vlady is a very nice lover , " she continued , " but too serious . He 's death at a dinner party . " <p> She sniffed the midnight air , delicately , through her finely shaped nose . I did , too , though mine is not nearly so handsome . <p> " There ! " she said . " Underneath the gladiola-can you smell it ? " <p> I smelled nothing . <p> " A pungency , " she said , sniffing once more . " It is always so after I have been alone a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wake me , the bruises , and a pungency underneath the gladiola . " <p> In sympathy I put my hand on hers . In sympathy for her bruises the blood came out on my cheeks and my loins congested . <p> Heavy footsteps sounded on the veranda . I turned in time to see a shadow shamble into the topiary , to be swallowed by the greater darkness of a moonless night . <p> Mrs. Willoughby leaned over the marmalade dish . <p> " Will you stay the night with me ? " she asked . <p> My heart jumped inside my safari jacket . <p> " Of course , delicious lady ! ' <p> " You misunderstand , " she said in a tone of unmistakable reproof . " I want you to watch . " <p> " Watch ? " <p> ( Was Lenin about to take up unlawful residence under Mrs. Willoughby 's mosquito net once again while Mr. Willoughby tended to his railroad ? ) <p> " To see what visits me in the night . " <p> My heart sank . <p> She dabbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crumb of toast . Her eau de cologne lingered in the breathless Mombasa morning . <p> " Come ; I want to show you something . " <p> She took me lightly by the arm and guided me into the topiary . Beside the carefully clipped thornbushes taught to grow up outside her bedroom ( ah , Beauty ! ) , she pointed out the trampled grass and-in earth still impressionable after the recently ended rains-two enormous footprints that could only be characterized as simian . <p> I did n't know it at the time , but the footsteps trodden into the rain-sodden earth outside Mrs. Willoughby 's bedroom had been left there by Prince Kong . ( The same Kong who , as King , would ravish a jodhpured Fay Wray in the 1930s . In 1910 , however , he was a moody young gorilla with as yet no appetite for virgin sacrifice . ) He had left the family 's hereditary stomping grounds in Central Africa and , after a long and circuitous peregrination , found himself in Mrs. Willoughby 's topiary garden on the outskirts of Mombasa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the length and breadth of the continent , transfixed by the walking sickness that then held sway . To my knowledge , however , no instances of animal contraction of the mysterious malady have ever been verified . Kong , as I would later discover , had been drawn to the open French windows by the strength of Mrs. Willoughby 's desire . <p> August 1910 <p> Mombasa <p> Dear Siggy , <p> An interesting case has lately fallen into my lap . A friend is being visited by an ape . She claims " it is always so " when she sleeps alone for any length of time . I would be interested in your analysis . Will you come ? <p> Regards , <p> N. September 1910 <p> Zurich <p> Dear N. , <p> Visitation by apes is well documented in the literature . The explanation lies in the unconscious : more precisely in the id . Sexual deprivation is , quite obviously , at the root here . The ape is a figment of your friend 's overactive imagination . ( The ape appears frequently in medieval art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable to come to Africa and suggest you take matters into your own hand . ( " Fallen into my lap " -a revealing Freudian slip-indicates that you may have already done so . ) <p> Yours truly , <p> Sigmund <p> P.S. Please do not call me " Siggy . " <p> October 1910 <p> Mombasa <p> Dear Siggy , <p> The ape is no figment ! I can send you footprints to prove it ! <p> Sincerely , <p> N. <p> N. : <p> You are clearly hysterical and delusional . Keep your footprints , and do not call me " Siggy " ! ! ! <p> Sigmund Freud <p> I lay under Mrs. Willoughby 's bed and waited . Up above me , Mrs. Willoughby slept , breathing in a way that reminded me of soft , fluttering things : of moths , or a satin camisole dropped negligently over a chair , handled by a wind from an open sash . The jungle came a little way inside the room through the French windows thrown open to receive the balm of night . I listened to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose above the topiary and threw the prickly shadow of the thornbushes onto the parquet , which was hard beneath my head . <p> Soon I , too , was sleeping . <p> I dreamed that Mrs. Willoughby was carried outside in the hairy arms of Kong ( although I did not know his name at the time ) into the moonlit topiary . There , on the wrought-iron garden bench , he made love to her : " Sweet Mrs. Willoughby . " <p> " What do you want , you big gorilla ? " <p> " Deep in the Congo , I caught the night-bloom of your desire . I came here to stand by your bed and watch you sleep . " He sighed . " I am smitten . " <p> Then with ardor did Kong press Mrs. Willoughby to him . With ardor and with strength of arm . But she repulsed him . <p> " I 'm not attracted to you physically . " <p> He beat his breast . " I can give you what no man can ! " <p> ( Leering braggadocio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . <p> " If you sleep with me , Beauty , there 's every possibility that I might change into a man . I 'm already a prince . " <p> " I have a lover as well as a husband who , though seldom home , adds a certain frisson to my extramarital affairs . " <p> Does she mean me ? I wondered . Does she consider me her lover ? We had twice or thrice dallied playfully under the mosquito net ; but each time I had come away feeling that I had failed to measure up . Perhaps she means Lenin . Vladimir Ilyich might not possess charm , such as one values in a dinner guest or pinochle partner ; but he has charisma in spite of his unstylish clothes and muddy shoes . Charisma in abundance , else how could he , seven years hence , foment a revolution of such magnitude as to topple the Romanovs ' centuries-old rule ? <p> The coming war would do much , of course , to weaken the monarchic hold on Russia . ( Have I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold-not only on nation-states but on my own state of mind-how nervous that war would make me , nervous as I was-am-have always been-my whole life long ? Perhaps I have not yet told you , but that war , the socalled Great War , did considerable damage to my sangfroid . <p> " Cherie , " said Kong , fiddling with Mrs. Willoughby 's nightdress . <p> Mrs. Willoughby slapped the brute . <p> Kong wept , inconsolable . <p> I woke in Mrs. Willoughby 's bed to find myself fiddling with her nightdress , with the buttons that did up the front . She was furious . " You have betrayed my trust ! " she said . " You 've played the brute as surely as that hairy ape did . " I remarked that , unlike the hairy ape , I had not bruised her ; but she took no notice . " Leave me at once ! " she commanded , giving me a shove . I fell out of bed . <p> " I was dreaming ! " I protested in mitigation . " One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I sat in the library , admiring Mr. Willoughby 's collection of Victorian erotica and a magnificent Cornwallis Harris portfolio of rhinoceros engravings . I also admired Mr. Willoughby 's Bombay gin ; and my admiration , though not unbounded , was sufficient to drain the neck of a recently unstoppered bottle . <p> Mr. Willoughby 's man knocked softly at the door before entering with a silver tray . He coughed discreetly into his fist , then , inclining towards me so that his black swallowtail opened gracefully , indicated a gilt-edged calling card . <p> I took the card from the tray and read : " Prince Ali Kong . The Congo . " <p> " Shall I show the gentleman in ? " Mr. Willoughby 's man asked . <p> " I do n't wish to see him , " I said disdainfully . <p> " If you 'll pardon me , sir-the gentleman insists . " <p> " Tell Kong I am not at home ! " I shouted . " Tell him that I do not talk to primates ! " <p> " Very good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and left the library . <p> I folded my hands on the fumed-oak desk ( not in prayer , but in perplexity ) and pondered the curious geometry in which I seemed to have become suddenly enmeshed . And then , astonished , I looked towards the library casement : someone was outside , scratching at the window ! <p> The following exchange occurred through the open window . To tell the truth , I was afraid to meet Kong otherwise . Gorillas , no matter how polished their manner , retain a dark and brutal instinct . Which is only natural . While Kong may have distinguished himself among beasts , he was one after all ; his top hat , spats , gloves and fastidious grooming did not for a moment make me forget his origins . ( As a convinced Darwinian , I recognized in Kong a tenuous propinquity ; but as a man , on safari in Africa , I was unwilling to accord him anything like equal status . While not one to lord it over the beasts , I nevertheless relished my superior evolution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Kong , offended . <p> " Yes . " <p> " Why ? " <p> " We can have nothing to say to each other . " <p> I looked away , unable to meet his piercing gaze . <p> " I disagree , " he said . " There 's Mrs. Willoughby . " <p> " What about Mrs. Willoughby ? " I bristled , not liking her name in his mouth . <p> " It seems we are both in love with her , " said Kong with admirable simplicity . <p> I disguised my admiration with a rebuke : " Whether I am or not is none of your concern ! You , on the other hand , have no business loving her ! " Indignant , I began to close the window but was prevented by his large hand and muscular arm . <p> " Because we are of different races ? " he demanded , and beneath the demand I detected the grievance of the perpetually slighted . <p> " Because we are of different species ! " I snarled . <p> He kept silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field to me , or you will meet me on the field of honor . " <p> Mrs. Willoughby was sleeping . I shook her-gently , then roughly-but she would not wake . Apparently she had contracted the sleeping sickness , which , like the walking sickness , was then general throughout Africa . She might sleep for weeks-or months-before waking . I undid her buttons and undressed her . I considered whether or not to make love to her while she slept but decided against it . To my mind it smacked of necrophilia-a practice I detested . I did , however , study her nakedness . It was pink and round and fragrant . It was the nakedness of a woman in the prime of life , and I longed to embrace it . But I continued in my resolve not to interfere with her sleeping . <p> I bit my lip and sighed , " Oh , Mrs. Willoughby ! " <p> I prayed that she might wake , that I might gather her to me ; but she did not wake . <p> I sat by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had promised her . Kong is here because she sleeps , I reasoned . He is no delusion or manifestation of hysteria , but a very real presence unleashed by Mrs. Willoughby 's dreams . Neither nightmare nor incubus , but substance ( even if hirsute ) . A pulse of erotic energy-embodied and clothed . Kong would be detained in Mombasa , in the vicinity of Mrs. Willoughby , who would be helpless before his depredations for as long as she slept . ( I had no faith in Kong 's self-restraint or finer feelings , given the bruises imprinted on her thigh . ) <p> " Oh , wake up , Mrs. Willoughby ! Wake ! " I shouted . <p> She was far down in the depths of sleep . I would have needed a grappling hook to raise her . <p> Night fell and the shadow of the thorns invaded the room . A wind flooded through the French windows and with it a pungency underneath the scent of gladiola . <p> " I think you do not understand desire , " said Kong . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did . <p> " I do n't mean the sudden arousals of your kind that are just as suddenly quelled ; I mean desire as a paroxysm of nature . Violent biological upheaval . Wildfire sweeping the blood . A glandular storm wracking body and nerves . Savagery and exaltation unknown in New York , London , or Paris . " <p> He took off his hat and coat , spats and lemon-colored gloves , his shirt and trousers . He stripped to his essence-the elemental condition of his kind . I saw strength of will revealed in a purely physical nature-vitality that transcended brutishness . He grew before my eyes , and in spite of myself I envied him . Then just as quickly as he had divested himself of the trappings of civilization , he put them on again and resumed the stature of a man . <p> " Where I come from , " he said , " all is desire ; all life comes into being by its force ; all is copulation and increase . All is-if you will pardon me-the long , tireless fuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thigh ; she stirred in her sleep and smiled . " She knows , " he said ; " as long as she dreams , she knows desire 's force . " <p> Fury rose up in me-fury that Mrs. Willoughby should be used so . I pulled his hand roughly away . <p> He slapped my face with a lemon-colored glove . <p> " Cigars at dawn , " he said . <p> Siggy , Siggy-how I wish you were here ! To be challenged by an ape in spats and yellow gloves to a duel with cigars ! How absurd ! How Freudian ! And how does one fight a duel with cigars ? <p> We met in the summerhouse behind the topiary . We faced each other across a pinochle table . Mr. Willoughby 's man entered with a mahogany humidor , which he placed on the green baize . On a distant lawn a badminton game was in progress . I listened to the shuttlecock strumming the racquets . Who can be playing badminton at this hour ? I wondered as Kong selected a cigar . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air of a connoisseur . <p> " One of Mr. Willoughby 's favorites , " his man said approvingly . <p> I chose a democratic Virginian with a Connecticut wrapper . <p> Mr. Willoughby 's man clipped the ends in a miniature guillotine and , having returned them to us , lit them . <p> " Close the windows , then leave us , " said Kong with a peremptory wave of his cigar 's burning end . <p> The man left , shutting the door behind him . <p> We sat in silence , the heavy blue smoke tumbling in the light that fell through the closed summerhouse windows . Eyes watering , throat burning , I thought of Mrs. Willoughby asleep in her bedroom and wondered if she was worth it . Ashamed , I sucked vigorously at my cigar , expelling clouds of pungent smoke across the pinochle table . Kong was unperturbed . <p> The pungency ! I said to myself . The pungency underneath the gladiola ! <p> It was then I lost consciousness . <p> We seemed to make love under water . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Willoughby drifted , her long auburn hair floating like weed . I swam above her attentively , darting here and there to give her what pleasure I could . Had I spoken , I would have told her how I desired her ; but I did not speak . Because of the water , because I had no wish to drown in the act of love , nor of speech either . I looked up at last and saw Kong , his broad face smiling in benediction . The end of his cigar extinguished . <p> I shrugged into consciousness in Mrs. Willoughby 's bedroom . By what mysterious mode of locomotion I had arrived there , I can not say . Mrs. Willoughby was gone . I examined the bed for signs of struggle but could find none . <p> I went out to the summerhouse in search of Kong ; but he , too , seemed to have vanished without leaving so much as a cigar ash to signify his presence . The gladiola were in full force , scenting the clear Mombasa morning . The shadows of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun advanced . Birdsong replaced that of the shuttlecock . <p> I found Mr. Willoughby 's man in the conservatory , polishing the horn of the gramophone . Recordings of Brahms 's four symphonies were stacked on a taboret . Mrs. Willoughby believed that plant life flourished in the presence of soothing melody . For this , she was derided as a crackpot . ( I had no opinion one way or the other , though I had often come to her defense in the Mombasa Hotel Bar , in order to insinuate myself into her favor . ) <p> " Have you seen Mrs. Willoughby ? " I asked the man . <p> " Gone , sir , " he replied , putting down his chamois cloth . <p> " Gone ? " <p> " Carried off by the hairy gentleman . " <p> It was as I had feared . <p> " Where ? " <p> He pointed beyond the topiary to a darkness . An obscurity . A silence punctuated by strange cries . " The jungle , sir . " He handed me a book bound in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He said I was to give you this . " <p> I opened the book and began to read : " Desire begins in sleep . .. . " <p>
