<p> As a boy , John Woo was an easy target for street gangs . <p> He was small for his age and still adapting to the ways of Hong Kong , where his family had fled in 1951 after the Communist takeover of China . " I used to be beat up by the gangs all the time , " he says . <p> In the beginning , Woo took it ; then he decided to fight back . " I became tough . I had to to survive . " <p> At 50 , Woo  --  the best known of the Hong Kong directors whose ' 80s action movies influenced the new generation of American filmmakers  --  is still very much a survivor . Most recently , he has survived the Hollywood gang . <p> Because of studio interference , the first two films he made in this country , " Hard Target " and " Broken Arrow , " were not all Woo had hoped . But he says his new one , " Face/Off , " with John Travolta and Nicolas Cage as men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pursuit of one another , is in the best tradition of his Hong Kong films . The movie opens Friday . <p> " It 's more completely my style than the other two because ' Face/Off ' is more human . There 's more character and emotion in this film , " Woo says . " Sometimes people see only action in my movies , but I always try to put in something else . " <p> Woo is perched on the edge of his seat in a San Francisco hotel room , as if about to leap up . His slow manner of speaking  --  he 's almost fluent in English , but sometimes it takes him a while to come up with the right word  --  is at odds with his body language . Dressed in an expensive tailored dark suit and matching dark silk shirt , Woo , who used to show up for interviews in sneakers and jeans , seems to be copying the sleek , monochromatic style of his pal Travolta . <p> The BBC once called Woo the " Mozart of mayhem . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees it as a way of making sense of his tumultuous childhood , where he not only was drawn into gang fights but also witnessed armed battles between Nationalists and Communists . <p> " I saw people being murdered . I grew up in a violent world , " says Woo , acknowledging that he has tried to put that violence in perspective in his films . <p> The commercial and critical success of his early Hong Kong films such as " A Better Tomorrow " and " A Bullet in the Head " attracted the attention of the Hollywood studios . After several offers , he finally agreed to come to this country to make " Hard Target " with Jean-Claude Van Damme in 1993 . But Woo had to edit out much of his trademark violence to avoid an NC-17 rating ; ultimately , the film was taken away from him and more trims were made to appease the studio . <p> " There were problems with ' Hard Target ' because I was n't used to the system here , " Woo says . " It 's complicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never knew you had to go to so many meetings . They kept going over the same things  --  it was so frustrating . And I was still learning the language and about the culture here , so that was really hard for me . " <p> His determination to make it here stemmed in part from a concern over what would happen to the Hong Kong film industry with the changeover in governments this summer . " I 'm sure the Chinese government will do some kind of control , maybe censor scripts , because of their system , " he says . So Woo brought his wife and three children with him and settled them into a house in the San Fernando Valley . <p> While " Broken Arrow , " also starring Travolta , was a hit at the box office last year , Woo was n't satisfied with it . " I just felt too much money and time were spent on special effects and there was not much left for the story . It was rush , rush , rush . I just worked with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The only concern was about the budget . " <p> These experiences taught him something about playing the Hollywood game . " I 'm still not really a player , but I learned how to be tough , to stand up for what I want , " Woo says . <p> Before he agreed to direct " Face/Off , " he asked that the script by Mike Werb and Michael Colleary , which had been set 200 years in the future , be changed to the present . In Hong Kong , Woo wrote all of his movies himself . In Hollywood , however , he has worked from other people 's scripts , " I think because of the topics  --  like something I would think of may work for Asia but not work here , " he says . <p> The futuristic angle bothered Woo because it would mean lots of computer-generated special effects . " I told them I 'm not ready for this kind of movie because I know nothing about the computer , " he says . " I wanted to take it out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more human . " <p> Fortunately for Woo , this time he had an executive producer , Michael Douglas ( yes , that Michael Douglas ) , who agreed with him and was willing to plead his case with Paramount Pictures . <p> " Michael never tried to control me because he knew my style and liked the way I worked , " Woo says . <p> " Face/Off " was done with hardly any special effects . Dummies were used in the scene where Travolta 's and Cage 's faces are exchanged . <p> Woo thinks Hollywood has gone too far with computer-generated images , substituting them for believable stories . " Everybody wants to do bigger and bigger , but those kind of special-effects movies seem real empty to me . It 's not necessary and it steals away from the drama . People need to see real feelings on the screen . <p> " Some people say American movies have a certain kind of formula , so that action is action and those kind of movies never are involved with any emotional stuff . But with ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make an action picture that is emotional . ' " <p> Woo welcomed ideas from his cast , including Oscar-nominated actress Joan Allen ( for " Nixon " and " The Crucible " ) , Gina Gershon of " Bound " and Dominique Swain , the star of the controversial new version of " Lolita , "  --  which has yet to find a distributor . " Dominique is kind of a rebel , " Woo says . " She reminds me of my daughter sometimes . My daughter and I have a kind of gap , a misunderstanding a little bit . She has a strong personality similar to Dominique 's . " <p> While everybody got some say in the development of their characters , Woo says he gets the final word on what ends up in the film . " I like to create on the set and I like to give a lot of creative freedom to my actors . But if John Travolta says he wants to put in a line and I do n't think it belongs , I will tell him no . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's my call ultimately . " <p> Cage says Woo has " a total sense of his own style . Watching him work was like watching a conductor . He has all his monitors spread out in front him  --  different monitors for different shots . You could see him lying back in his chair examining each of his shots on playback and putting it together in his mind  --  how it would cut together and de ciding either he 's got enough or we 've got to do it again . He knows exactly what he wants . " <p> In Hong Kong , Woo 's film budget was typically $ 3 million . Now , he says , his salary is more than that . Even with minimal special effects , " Face/Off " cost $ 90 million . <p> " The good thing about having that kind of budget is you can hire a lot more talented people to work with , " Woo says . " But in Hollywood , in some ways , they are wasting money . You do n't need that much to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having 200 or 300 people on a set , all those assistants and too many producers . You only need one , you know . <p> " In Hong Kong , everything was so simple . You just need 70 people on a set . In Hong Kong , we save time on all those meetings . We just need one meeting and that 's it , not all those meetings where you keep going over the same thing . " <p> Still , he has no plans to return there to make films . " I do n't think I 'll go back . It 's so different now and I 'm getting used to the system here , " says Woo , who is starting work on his next Hollywood film , a comedy called " King 's Ransom , " which he describes as an " homage " to such chic caper movies as " To Catch a Thief " and " The Thomas Crown Affair . " <p> " When I first came here , I thought I had to represent Hong Kong films in America . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to do something not to let Hong Kong people down . ' I took too much responsibility . It was n't fun . So now I say , ' I 'm not going to stand for everyone . I 'm just going to be myself and do what I like . ' " <p> ' FACE/OFF ' <p> The movie opens Friday at Bay Area theaters.
