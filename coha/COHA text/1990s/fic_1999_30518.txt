Chapter 1 : Cries in the Night At first I thought I was dreaming , for when I woke and opened my eyes , I heard nothing but the low whistle of the wind blowing up from the ocean . The stream of moonlight filtering through my sheer white curtain bathed the walls in a pale yellow glow . My window shutters banged against the clapboard and then , I heard the sound again , this time with my eyes wide . I listened , my heart tapping like a steadily growing drumbeat in anticipation of some important announcement or event . After a moment I heard it once more . It sounded like a cat in heat , but we had no cats . Daddy hated pets , finding them more of an obligation than a pleasure . The only animals he said had any purpose was a watchdog or a seeing-eye dog , and he had no need for either . Our house was far enough away from the downtown Provincetown area and surrounded by walls ten feet high with an entrance gate Daddy had Jerome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also kept his shotgun under the bed , " just in case . " It was , he said , a lot cheaper than feeding some mongrel , and that , he concluded , " was the bottom line . " This time the sound was even louder . I sat up so quickly someone would think I had springs under me , but I realized the shrill cries were not in my imagination or from nightmares . The noise was coming through the wall between my room and Belinda 's . It was n't a howl , exactly , nor was it a screech . There was something familiar about the sound and yet something starkly unusual . It was certainly not a noise Belinda would make herself , but there was no doubt it was emanating from her bedroom . I stepped off my bed , scooped up my robe from the chair beside my bed , ady shook . I stepped up to her and gazed down at the bloody sight . " You were pregnant ? All this time you 've been pregnant ? " I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now everything made sense . A number of times during the past few months Daddy and I had made comments about Belinda 's gaining weight . She was ravenous at every meal lately and did n't seem at all concerned about her widening hips and bloated face . I really did n't care . It was more Daddy who complained . His precious little Barbie doll was disappearing right before his eyes and in its place grew this self-indulgent creature I called my sister . Oh , once or twice , I said things like , " Are n't you afraid you 'll lose your entourage of boyfriends ? " She did n't seem concerned even though it was true that fewer and fewer young men came around to visit her or ask her to go sailing , take walks on the beach or spend an evening in town . Now that I stared down at her squirming on the bedroom floor , her child quiet and unmoving between her thighs , I realized why she had so adamantly kept me from seeing her naked a number of times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovery of a pair of girdles in a box . What I also understood now was her sudden and uncharacteristic interest in and desire for those baggy dresses she used to refer to as " Granny clothes " whenever I wore them . I knelt beside her and put my hand on the infant 's tiny chest . It felt cold already and it did not vibrate with any heartbeat , nor did it rise and fall with any breath . " I do n't think it 's alive , " I said . She whimpered again . " Please , Olivia , get it away . I ... ca n't touch it , " she said . I did n't move quickly . I stared at the wrinkled little crea ture for a while , studying its facial features , its blue lips and its fingers so tiny even one of my own small fingers was the width of nearly all five of one of its hands . " It was a boy , " I said , more as a thought voiced aloud than anything she wanted to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I watched her suffering for a moment , still dumbfounded at how well she had kept this secret . What would our daddy think of his precious little princess now ? I wondered . " Do you have any idea , even an inkling of an idea , how terrible this is , Belinda ? Did n't you consider this inevitable outcome and think about what it was going to do to our parents ? Why did n't you come forward earlier so Daddy could have done something about this instead of deceiving everyone and hiding your condition ? " " I was afraid , " she murmured and began to sniffle and sob . " I thought everyone would just hate me . " " Oh , and now we just love you ? " I countered . She closed her eyes and held her breath a moment . " Please , please , Olivia , help me , " she begged . " How many months were you pregnant ? " I asked . " I do n't know exactly , but at least six or seven , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so tiny . It 's a premature birth . I knew you were having sex with some of your boyfriends , Belinda . I just knew it . I told you this would happen . I warned you . Now look , just look at what you 've reaped with your wild , selfish behavior . " She sobbed an apology . " Right , " I muttered . " We 'll all just blink and it will be gone . " " Please , Olivia ... " " Who is the father ? " I demanded . She did n't reply . " You 've got to say , Olivia . Whoever he is he bears at least half the responsibility . Daddy 's going to want to know . W ho is it ? Arnold Miller ? " He was a boy she had been with a great deal more than the others . " No , " she said quickly . " Arnold and I never went far enough . " " Then who was it , Belinda ? I 'm not going to play a guessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tell me , I 'll leave you here wallowing in this ... disaster . " " I do n't know , " she wailed . " Please , Olivia . " " How can you not know unless you ... my God , Belinda , how many boys have you slept with ? And so closely together that you ca n't pinpoint who would be the father of this ... this child ? " At the moment I did n't know what bothered me more : that she had so many lovers or that I had had none . She just shook her head . " I do n't know , Olivia . I do n't know . I do n't want to blame anyone . Please . " " You 'll have to tell Daddy something , Belinda , " I warned . " He wo n't settle for an ' I do n't know . ' " She opened her eyes and gazed up at me , and for a moment , I thought she was going to reveal the father of her baby . Was it someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I ca n't blame someone if I do n't know for sure , " she finally declared . " Can I ? " " They 're all to blame . You might as well name all of them and let each one sweat , " I said , thinking that would be a just and poetic revenge . " I ca n't , " she wailed . She shook her head so hard , I thought she would tear it off her neck . " All right , suit yourself . You 'll see what 's going to happen now . You 'll see , " I predicted . I rose and went to her bathroom to get some towels . Then I returned and rolled the dead infant onto one . I placed it and the afterbirth and umbilical cord on the bed just as Daddy opened the door and stepped back into the room . He looked around , his eyes avoiding Belinda for a moment . He g azed at the child before turning to me with a questioning look . " He 's dead , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Most likely , " he said and approached the bed . He reached down slowly with his big hand and put the tip of his forefinger on the infant 's neck . " Yes , " he said . " A blessing . " Belinda began to wail . " Stop it ! " I snapped , hovering over her . " Do you want Carmelita to hear and come running up here ? " Belinda muffled her sobs and turned over on her side . " Can you get her cleaned up and back to bed ? " Daddy asked me . " Yes , Daddy . " " Is she ... bleeding or anything ? Are we going to need a doctor ? " " I do n't think so . " " Make sure . I 'll be right back , " he said . " How 's Mother ? " " I have her calmed down a bit , but she 's still trembling badly , " he said sorrowfully . " After I get Belinda into the bathtub , I 'll look in on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He hurried from the room . " Get up , Belinda . I ca n't lift you and carry you into the bathroom . I 'm going to run some water in your tub . At least cover yourself for now . You look absolutely disgusting moaning and wallowing on the floor , " I said . She whimpered her reply and started to brace herself on her elbows . There was blood on her legs , but she did n't look to be bleeding anymore . She took deep breaths again and sighed so deeply I thought she had passed out . " Are you in any pain ? " " I do n't need a doctor , " she said . " I 'll be all right . " " Maybe you do n't need a doctor , but whether or not you 'll be all right remains to be seen , " I said . I glanced again at the dead infant . I could n't make out the color of its few strands of hair because its head was covered with sticky blood . There was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be , I thought , and went to the bathroom to run Belinda 's tub . After I helped her get in , I heard Daddy return to the room . I went to the bathroom door and saw he had brought a small cardboard shoe box along . He glanced at me as he lifted the dead infant , wrapped it more tightly in the blanket , and then carefully , as if it were still alive , put it in the box . " We 've got to clean this up ourselves , " he said , nodding at the floor . " I do n't want the servants knowing anything , Olivia . " " I 'll take care of it , Daddy . " " How is she ? " " She 's all right . She 'll live , " I said sharply . He nodded again and lifted the box in his arms . " What are you going to do , Daddy ? " He paused . " I 'll have to bury the poor thing , " he said . For a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makeshift coffin in his arms . " Do n't we have to report it to someone ? " I asked . " If we do that , Olivia , this terrible event will be headline news in every home and tavern in Provincetown . It would definitely do Belinda no good , and it would be very damaging to the family . Apparently , she did a good job of keeping all this a secret from us , but question her vigorously and make sure no one else knows about it , " he added . " Yes , Daddy . " " Do n't forget . As soon as you finish with her , please look in on your mother . " " I will , Daddy . " He stared for a moment and then looked at the box in his arms . " It has to be this way , " he concluded , more for himself than for me , I thought . He turned and hurried out of the bedroom with the box cradled securely in his arms . I returned to the tub and saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry her body and then I brought her a new , clean nightgown . After I got her back into bed , I went downstairs to the utility room . I found I was tiptoing and slinking along in my own home , moving like a burglar to keep from waking Carmelita , our maid and cook , or Jerome . I got a pail , a mop , rags and some detergent . Then I returned to Belinda 's room and filled the pail with hot water . Fortunately , she had lowered herself from the bed onto a throw rug and the rug had absorbed most of the blood . I rolled up the rug and then washed away any traces of the horrendous event . Belinda lay there with her eyes closed , moaning softly , occasionally sobbing . As I worked , I rattled off a relentless series of complaints and chastisements . " You 've really done it this time . Mother is beside herself . Daddy looked pale enough to be a corpse , too . We 'll all have nightmares forever . What did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone knowing ? " I paused and looked down at her wilting little face . " Did you think being pregnant was like having a cold or the measles ? Maybe you damaged yourself forever , Belinda . Maybe now you 'll never be able to have a child decently . No one will want to marry you . What were you thinking ? " I ranted . How could this be happening ? I wondered . How could anyone , even Belinda , do such a thing to herself and her family ? " Please , Olivia . Please , stop . Please , " she begged putting her hands over her ears . " I 'll stop . I should stop and let you clean up this mess , " I muttered . " Does anyone else know about your being pregnant ? You did n't tell any of your bubbleheaded friends at school , did you ? " I followed . Most of Belinda 's friends were silly , spoiled girls I called the Bubble Gum Club because I thought their brains were full of bubbles . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swore . " I always got dressed and undressed in private when I took physical education class , and I never showered at school . " " You better be telling the truth , " I warned her . I went to the bathroom and cleaned up the tub so Carmelita would n't find any traces of this tragedy . Daddy returned , his dark brown hair wild , his eyes full of torment and shock . He saw the rug and the wet rags and picked everything up . " I 'm going to bury all this too , " he mumbled . " It must be as if none of this ever happened . " He looked about madly . " You 've got everything , Daddy . " " Good , " he said and charged out . I had never seen our father look more crazed . It actually frightened me more than it frightened Belinda , who was lying there with her eyes closed most of the time . I imagined she was afraid to look him in the face now . After Daddy left again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was sitting at the edge of her bed , working up the strength to stand and see about Belinda . She still looked quite pale , her breathing labored . " Mother , you should lie down again , " I said rushing to her side . " How is Belinda ? " " She 'll be all right . I got her cleaned up and back to bed . " " And ... " " Daddy 's taken care of all the rest . " " Taken care ? " " The baby died right away , Mother , " I said . " It was premature . Daddy took the baby and buried it someplace . He said he does n't want anyone to know . " " Buried ? " she gasped and shook her head . " God forgive us , " she whispered . I thought she would fall forward to the floor , so I seized her by the elbow and tried to get her to lie back , but she shook her head . " I have to look in on her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put my arm around he r waist and helped her to the door . She grew stronger as she walked and returned to Belinda 's bedroom . Belinda started to sob as Mother approached her . " I 'm sorry , Mommy , " she whimpered . " I 'm sorry . " Mother sat on the bed and held her in her arms , and as Belinda cried , Mother rocked her . " Poor child , " she said . " Poor child ? She ought a be whipped , " I muttered , but I could n't help feeling sorry for her , too , even though I did n't want to give her an iota of sympathy . " There , there , dear . It 's all right . It will be all right , " Mother chanted . Finally , Belinda sucked back her sniffles and wiped her cheeks . " I know I should have told you , Mommy , but I just could n't . I was too ashamed and afraid , " she explained . " That made a bad thing worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from your parents , or your sister , " she said , gazing at me . Belinda looked at me , too . " We all love you and would want to help you . " " I know , Mommy . I 'm sorry , " she said . " How did such a thing happen ? " Mother asked in a hoarse whisper , looking more at me than at Belinda now . For as long as I could remember , Mother turned to me to learn things about Belinda . She always expected I was in charge of my younger sister , but I had been away at finishing school most of this year , and knew about Belinda 's exploits only through gossip and the little I observed on holidays . This was Belinda 's senior year , and I thought she had been given too much freedom , much more than I had been given . Without me at home , Mother did n't keep a good account of Belinda 's whereabouts and activities . She was permitted to sleep at her friends ' homes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy to notice , I thought , and now loo k at what had resulted . " She says she does n't know who the father is , " I declared . " Apparently , there are too many candidates . " " What ? " Mother asked , her face twisted in disbelief . Did she think Belinda was some sort of angel just because Daddy always treated her like his little cherub ? " Too many ? How can there have been too many , Belinda ? " " I do n't know , Mommy . Please , I do n't want to think about it . Please , " she begged and started to sob again . " We should know , " I insisted . " Daddy should know and go see them . " " Maybe it 's better we do n't , " Mother concluded , succumbing to Belinda 's teary grimaces and wails . " What good is it going to do anyone now ? " " People should be responsible for their actions , Mother . Daddy 's going to want to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Belinda moaned . " All right , honey . All right . Olivia will get you some water . " " I need something colder , something with ice , " she demanded . " So go get it , " I snapped . " Olivia , please , " Mother said , turning her soft eyes to me . " We should n't be babying her now , Mother . She 's done a terrible thing to all of us , " I said , feeling abused too . Mother just held her gaze , pleading with her eyes . I turned and hurried out of the room and down the stairs . Carmelita had finally been roused by the sound of the footsteps on the stairway and the activity above . She was a tall , very dark skinned , half-Portuguese , half-Negro woman , what we called a Brava on the Cape , and she had been working for our family for the last ten years . She was in her mid-forties , lean , with a narrow face and eyes the color of obsidian . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because she was strong , efficient and discreet . She seemed to have no opinions about any of us and kept to herself when she was n't working . Her licorice-black hair was down to her shoulders when she emerged from her quarters to greet me . She was in her nightgown and robe . " Is someone sick ? " she asked . " Belinda , " I said . " Oh . Is there anything I can do ? " " No thank you , Carmelita , " I said . " I can take care of it , " I said firmly . She fixed those dark eyes on my face for a moment and , expressionless , nodded and returned to her maid 's quarters at the rear of the house . I knew she did n't believe me , but even when I was just a young girl , Carmelita never challenged anything I told her . When I was in the kitchen getting Belinda 's drink , Daddy came in through the rear door off the pantry . He stood there a moment , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's done , " he said . " How is it up there ? " he asked , his eyes shifting toward the ceiling . " Mother 's with her . I 'm just getting her a cold drink . " Daddy nodded and looked at his smudged wrists and hands before looking back at me . " You understand why I 'm doing it this way , do n't you , Olivia ? The bottom line is it 's the best way to protect the family . " " I understand , Daddy . " " She told you no one else knows about this ? " " That 's what she said , " I replied , not without a smirk of skepticism that Daddy chose to ignore . " Good , " he said . " Good . " " She wo n't tell me who the father is , however , " I added . " She claims she does n't know . " He shook his head . " Maybe it 's better . We ca n't go accusing someone and stir up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he should n't get away with it , Daddy . " " It 's done and over , " he said . " Let it all be buried , " he added and then left to wash up be fore returning to see Belinda . Once again , I thought , my spoiled sister gets away with something terrible . When I returned to Belinda 's room with her water , I found Mother had her lying back comfortably . I gave her the cold drink and she sipped it and smiled up at me . " Thank you , Olivia . I 'm sorry I put you through so much . " " Yes , you did , " I said without flinching . She looked like she would burst into tears again and make Mother feel more terrible . " Just rest now , Belinda . You do n't want to get seriously ill , " I added mercifully . She changed her expression instantly to one of gratitude and then reached out to take my hand . " You 're my best sister , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister , Belinda . " " I know , but you 're so good to me . " " She is good to you . She 's good to all of us , " Mother said smiling at me . " What we all have to do now is get some rest . " " How can anyone sleep after this ? " I muttered . If Mother heard , she chose to ignore me . Daddy came to the door and looked in at us . " Well ? " he asked . " She 's doing fine , Winston , " Mother said . " That 's good . It 's better we behave as if this did n't happen , " he advised . " You might as well pretend there 's no ocean out there , " I declared . " Your father 's right , Olivia . It wo n't do any good to talk about it , even amongst ourselves . Let 's close our eyes and imagine it was a nightmare , " she suggested . It did n't surprise me to hear her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handled most of the unpleasantness in her life . Not even an event like this would be any different . She leaned over to kiss Belinda who smiled at her , and then she left the room . Daddy stood there a moment gazing in at me , at the floor and then at Be linda . " Everyone just go to sleep , " he said and left . I looked at Belinda . She offered me her small smile , but I just shook my head at her . " I 'm so tired , Olivia , " she said . " I feel so weak inside , too , but I did n't want to alarm anyone . Daddy would n't want me to have to go to a doctor . " " You 'll live , " I said . " Just go to sleep . " I checked the room once more and then started out , pausing in the doorway to look back at her . She looked small , like a little girl again . In moments she was asleep . I lay awake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my parents . I thought about that dead infant whose spark of life went out so quickly and who was interred someplace on our grounds so soon afterward , he surely had no memory of ever being born into this family . At the moment , I thought , he was the lucky one . Belinda remained at home for the rest of the week . We told everyone she had the flu . I thought that Carmelita knew something far more serious had occurred . She brought Belinda her meals so she saw that Belinda was n't coughing or sneezing . However , Mother pampered her and behaved as if our lies were really the truth . I heard her talking to her friends on the telephone , telling them how sick Belinda was . " One day she was fine and the next , she was as sick as a dog , " she rambled , describing the symptoms , even claiming she had phoned the doctor for instructions . It all disgusted me . I was especially amazed at how quickly Daddy had adjusted to the faade he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and dressed at his usual hour , already seated at the breakfast table , reading his newspaper as though the night before really had been just a bad dream . The only indication in his face was a quick but sharp look at me when Carmelita came into the dining room and inquired as to Belinda 's health . That was when Mother went into her long , detailed explanation , pouring out her brook of bubbling white lies . Daddy looked pleased . Since I had returned from finishing school , I had gone to work for him as an apprentice accountant . Daddy decided that it would be a waste to send me to some liberal arts college , " just to fill the time , until you find a decent and proper man to marry , Olivia . Any man you marry will appreciate you more for doing something practical , " he added . I was n't excited about going to college anyway , and I had always been very good with numbers . Daddy claimed I had a good mind for business . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl selling cranberries from our bog . I set up a stand on the street that ran by our property . Tourists thought it was sweet seeing a little girl behave so seriously about money . What impressed Daddy was that I took my money and had him put it into an interest-bearing savings account rather than spend it in the candy or toy stores . " At least I have someone in the family to inherit my business , " he declared . He had come to accept that he would n't have a son , but in time , I believed he no longer thought of me as an inferior substitute . He gave me too many compliments at the office for me to believe that . Daddy was truly a self-made millionaire , a success story that illustrated the American dream : a small entrepreneur who made good business decisions and gradually but firmly built a bigger and bigger business . He was written up in many regional magazines and once in the Boston papers . He had begun with a single fis hing boat and then bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a fleet of vessels providing seafood for an ever-growing national market . He expanded into the canning of shrimp in Boston and built an impressive financial chain of related businesses , making the shrewd move to get a commanding interest in the trucking facilities so he could control his overhead . By his own admission , he was at times a ruthless businessman , smothering competition , dropping prices to drive them out of his territories . He became more and more influential in politics , picked up government contracts and continued to expand his reach and hold on his markets . After less than six months , I knew our mother company inside and out , and Daddy even permitted me to sit in on some of his business meetings to listen and learn more . After they ended , he often turned to me to get my opinions , and a number of times , he took my advice . Belinda , on the other hand , did n't know the first thing about our business . According to the way she behaved and thought , money came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was there , and there was never a drought , never a time when she ever heard the words , " We ca n't afford that , Belinda . " I often lectured her about being ungrateful and unappreciative . " You take everything for granted as though it 's owed to you , " I accused . She gave me that sweet smile of hers and shrugged . I could accuse her of murder and she would do the same . She rarely argued or denied anything . It was as if she believed she would be immune from responsibility and guilt , that she had been given some holy dispensation and could do whatever her little heart desired , no matter what the consequences . It was even tr ue now , I thought disgustedly , with our parents claiming it was better to pretend nothing happened . Belinda just had the flu . I almost believed Daddy had convinced himself he had n't buried a premature infant . The day after when I returned from the office , I wandered out behind our house , curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our land behind the house ran nearly a full acre before it reached the cliff that looked out over the Atlantic Ocean . It was a sharp descent to the rocky beach below . There were some safe pathways that led down to the small private beach we had , only a clam shell 's toss away . Our yard had sprawling maples and some oak trees , and a large part of it remained uncultivated . Poison ivy grew among the brambles and wild roses and more than once , Belinda had wandered too close , suffering the results for weeks after . A large lawn was bordered by crocus clusters , Emperor tulips , jonquils and daffodils . There was a gazebo and a pond with benches around it , and I found it so restful to sit there and look out to sea . Sometimes , I would walk out to the edge of the cliff and watch the tide , mesmerized by the rhythmic movement of the waves , the breakers , the spray shooting up from the rocks , listening to the seagulls scream as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very edge and close my eyes . I could feel my body sway as if it were tempted to fly off the cliff and crash on the rocks below . When she was younger , Belinda was frightened by the ocean . She was not fond of sailing , hated the danger of man-of-wars and the smell of seaweed . She rarely , if ever , went hunting for driftwood . The only reason she could see for going to the beach was to have a party and th en to stay far enough away from the water so as not to even be sprayed by the waves crashing against the shore . Once , when I was nine and she was seven , I took her out to the edge of the cliff with me and asked her to close her eyes . It frightened her so much she turned and ran back to the house . I thought about that now and wondered what I would have done if she had fallen . Jerome had just finished doing some weeding when I stepped out back to find the grave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my arms folded across my body , I walked as casually as I could down the slate rock pathway , my eyes flitting from side to side , searching for signs of dirt that had been disturbed . I walked all the way out to the edge of the cliff without seeing anything . Where could Daddy have put the carton and other things ? It would n't be just a little hole , would it ? I went around toward the maples and paused when I thought I had found an area under one of the trees that looked like it had been dug up . I stepped closer and when I knelt and inspected the ground , I decided this was the place . It put a shudder in me and I rose as if I expected the dead infant to cry for help , even with its muted voice . Years later , I would come here again and find the place overgrown , but in the midst of the crab grass and flat emerald weeds , would be a patch of juniper swaying in the ocean wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment I was angry about it , though . I did n't like feeling creepy and morose . I did n't like burying Belinda 's sins because I did n't like lies . When you lie , I thought , you make yourself vulnerable and weak . Daddy was a much weaker man in my eyes because of what he had done , though I was sure t hat he had his nightmares , too . I fled from the spot , hating Belinda for putting us all in this horrible place . Daddy should have made Belinda suffer her consequences and not leave her to be pampered upstairs all week , I thought . I believed he would never bring it up again , but he surprised me one night toward the end of that week . He was in his den going over the family accounts when I walked by and he called to me . " Close the door , Olivia , " he ordered as soon as I entered . I did so and then turned to him . He sat behind his desk stiffly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olivia . I notice you 've been different all this week , looking at me as if you expected me to say or do something more . " " I do n't mean to be your conscience , Daddy , " I said and he winced as though I had spit at him . " I 'm sorry . It 's just hard for me to pretend nothing happened . " " Listen to me , Olivia . The most important quality is loyalty . Every family is a world unto itself and every member of that little world must protect it at any cost . Only then can individual liberty , interests and talents be pursued . Build the family first , Olivia . The only rule for morality is what 's good for the family is good , " he said , his eyes firm . " It 's the lesson my father taught me and the lesson I hope you will take to heart . " Among ourselves , we can criticize and regret , but we have to put it aside when it threatens the family . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's the only flag I salute and the only cause for which I will give my life . " I stared a moment . Daddy looked like he was about to cry now . His lips were pressed together so hard , his cheeks bulged . " Do n't condemn me for loving all of you , loving my family name and reput ation so much , Olivia . Learn from it , " he pleaded . I took a deep breath . Daddy and I had had many conversations in the past , but I rarely if ever saw his eyes fill with tears . I felt bad for him , felt sorry I had made him feel any guilt . " I understand , Daddy , " I said . " I really do . " " That 's good , Olivia , because you 're my hope . You will have many decisions to make for our family after I 'm gone , and I hope you will always remember this week and remember what I told you to use as your guiding principle . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled and rose . Then he walked around the desk and put his arm around me . " I 'm proud of you , Olivia . " He kissed me on the forehead . " Very proud , " he said . I watched him return to his desk . He looked tired , like a man carrying too many burdens . I remained a moment until he lowered his eyes to his papers , and then I left him . His words clung to me even after I had put out the lights that night and lowered my head to the pillow . They lingered with the memory of his tear-filled eyes . There is a terrible price to pay for being a leader , I thought , a terrible burden . Maybe Belinda was better off than any of us , especially me .
