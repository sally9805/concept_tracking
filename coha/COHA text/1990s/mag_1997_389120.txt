AIDS is rapidly spreading among " nice " Black girls who do n't shoot drugs or sleep with strangers Headnote This cautionary tale of sex in the nineties helps explain how it can happen By Stephanie A. Crockets // Joseph Kelly loves to gamble . His need to push his luck can spin so far out of control that he sometimes attends Gamblers Anonymous meetings . He usually puts his money on card games like tonk and spades . But Joseph Kelly will bet on just about anything if the stakes are high enough-anything , including his life and yours . Now 25 , Kelly first agreed to share this story two years ago . A heterosexual from Washington , D.C. , he loves women almost as much he loves playing cards . He treats his two passions the same . He plays women like a bad hand , always looking for one that 's better . As a result , most of his recent relationships have been nothing more than one-night stands-lots of sex , often without condoms . " Every woman I meet is a potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to work too hard to find someone willing to take him up on his offer : " When it comes down to it , a lot of people just want to have sex . " He 's no star athlete or big-name entertainer trailed by herds of starstruck groupies . As far as looks are concerned , he 's a regular guy , most comfortable in blue jeans and a pair of Timberland boots , twisting his baby dreads and listening to the Leaving Las Vegas sound track or local jazz musician Sunny Sumter 's Getting to Know You . He has a Quiet Storm deejay kind of voice . It 's smooth and deep , always ready to drop a oneliner or be part of an " Ebonics moment . " In other words , he could be the dude who bought you a drink at last Friday 's after-work happy hour , the brother you slept with last night or the new guy who 's been calling up your daughter . He 's better-read than the average Joe . He 's a junior English major at the University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met , he was working part-time at the Library of Congress . His self-published book of poetry , Jahi Playin ' Indigo , can be found at bookstores in the Washington , D.C. , area . He spends Fridays at a community center called the Sasha Bruce House , teaching young people to express themselves through writing . He 's smart enough to understand the risks involved in having unsafe sex with a woman he barely knows . He 's aware that with each new partner he increases his chances of contracting HIV . So far he has tested negative seven times for the AIDS virus . Still , he continues to have casual condomless sex . He does n't think the numbers apply to him , his age group or his lifestyle . After all , he 's not gay and he 's not an intravenous drug user . He says the media have blown " the AIDS thing " out of proportion . He believes the odds are in his favor . To some , this story may seem extreme , over the edge , atypical of the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect to find in the nineties . But Joseph Kelly is clearly not an exception . You know him . His behavior hits close to your home . Statistics compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta underscore the extent to which the African-American community is being ravaged by an epidemic of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs ) . The reasons have nothing to do with race , ethnicity or a government conspiracy to eradicate the Black community . At issue is our lifestyle . It is because too many of us-whether gay , straight , male or female-continue to have unprotected sex with multiple partners or people we barely know . African-Americans make up 13 percent of the population , yet we now account for 41. percent of all AIDS cases in the United States . According to projections from the Harvard AIDS Institute , by the year 2000 more than half of all the country 's AIDS cases will be within the African-American community . Many men do n't like wearing a condom . They say sex is better without it . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot more deadly . Because of the structure of the female genital tract , women run a much higher risk of contracting the virus from a man than men do from women . That 's why , as the disease is increasingly transmitted through heterosexual contact , it is claiming the lives of African-American women at such an alarming rate . The AIDS rate among Black women is three times as high as that among Latinas and 18 times as high as that among White women . Today Black women make up more than half of all the women who have died of AIDS . The numbers are scary-but apparently not scary enough to persuade men like Joseph Kelly or the women they have casual sex with to use condoms . " The numbers are not being put out there to make the community look bad , " says Dr. September Williams , a Boston-area physician and medical ethicist affiliated with the Harvard AIDS Institute . " The profile of the AIDS epidemic is changing . Imagine the equivalent of two large classrooms of African-American men and women being infected every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has had an STD and several infections , but nothing incurable . So far , these " minor losses " have n't been enough to keep him out of the game . Because he has never contracted the big one , he figures he 'll keep playing . But catching an STD is not like catching a cold or the flu . For one thing , says Dr. Hilda Hutcherson , director of the Center of Women 's Health at Columbia University in New York City and the author of Having Your Baby : A Guide for African American Women , some STDs are hard to detect . Most sexually active men know that a penile drip is a symptom of gonorrhea . But no such drip warns a man when he has syphilis . The early sign often resembles a cold sore . Left untreated , the disease can damage the heart , brain and bones . Chlamydia , the most common STD , is barely noticeable in most women . Left untreated , it can damage the fallopian tube , leading to miscarriage or infertility . Babies born to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sexually transmitted viruses are also linked to cancer of the cervix , vagina and penis . Genital herpes , another STD , is not only incurable but it also renders the person carrying the infection more vulnerable to HIV . So testing negative for HIV but positive for other less worrisome viruses , bugs and infections does n't exactly make you a winner . " This is not a game , " warns Hutcherson . " STDs are not benign . " The bedroom is n't the only place where Kelly takes risks . Ever since childhood he has engaged in adventurous , if not reckless , activities . When he was 11 and on a family trip to Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey , he got off a roller coaster on the wrong platform . When he realized he should be on the platform on the other side , he considered jumping across the track and risking a potentially fatal fall . His family and other bystanders persuaded him not to . But he promised himself he would never again wonder what could have happened ; he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tables , the dresser and the refrigerator , " his older sister , Jackie , recalls . " It 's a wonder he did n't break his legs or something . I used to think he was showing off . But I guess that 's just how he is . " When he wanted to know what it felt like to hang himself , he tied the venetian-blind cord around his neck and jumped off his grandmother 's bed . " It hurt like hell , " he remembers . When he wanted to experience chicken pox , he deliberately caught it by rubbing his hands on the face of a friend who was infected . Once he lit a match in front of an aerosol can to make a blowtorch . As a teenager , he continued to flirt with death by walking in the dead of night in some of D.C. 's most dangerous neighborhoods . None of the bad things that could have happened ever did . You could call those risks classic adolescent-guy behavior . Bungee jumping . Swallowing goldfish . Whatever turns you on . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance it . He likes the uncertainty and the accompanying feeling of anxiety that begins in the pit of his stomach and works its way up through his chest , making his heart race . " I have unprotected sex because there 's a thrill behind it , " he says . " Having sex with a woman is like winning $500 in a tonk game . If I lose my life , I lose my life . But if I win , I get another chance to play . " I do n't know when I will be satisfied , " he continues . " People say , You wo n't be happy until it kills you . ' Like going public with this story . Telling this story is a big risk to my reputation . I do n't know what 's going to happen . But I 'm dying to find out . " But this is his life , you remind him , and the lives of his partners and the lives of his partners ' partners . " One thing I do n't do is take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't put other people at risk ; they put themselves at risk . I figure if you have sex with me without even knowing me , then we 're just two gamblers playing the odds . " This is how it happens : Before sex begins , Kelly always hears voices . They cloud his mind from the moment he starts kissing a woman , whispering at times , yelling at others , Wear a condom ! You 'd better wear a condom ! Initially he listens . But the closer he gets to scoring-well , anything can happen . He heard the voices one fall evening when he spent the night with a woman he 'd met in class , just two weeks after his sixth negative HIV test result . He did n't really know her but he wanted to , so he invited her over to his place to study . Twenty minutes into the session , at Kelly 's suggestion they took a " study break . " He asked her if she knew how to play tonk . She said yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then she won . Then she won again . And again . Kelly decided to make things more fun and challenging by playing for kisses . She agreed . He won . She kissed his hand . When she won , he kissed her shoe . She started winning a lot , so Kelly started kissing a lot . Then he won again . He pulled her close to him , and this time , the kissing was long , deep and passionate . And so began another one-nighter in which he would have unprotected sex with a woman he barely knew . " I did n't want to stop to put on a condom , because I thought she would realize this was wrong and change her mind , " he explains . They had sex twice that night . Afterward they talked about it and their previous sexual experiences with others . Kelly was surprised that she had been so promiscuous . " She was very open about her sex life , " he says . " But by the time she finished , I was upset . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Even though he was scared when he learned she had been as reckless as he had , just thinking about her lively sexual history " turned me on . " So he hooked up with her again a few weeks later . " I asked her if she wanted me to wear a condom , and she said no , " he says . " Have you seen those cartoons of people with an angel on one shoulder and the devil on the other ? Well , that was me . The angel was saying , Go put on a condom ! Quickly , do not delay ! The devil was saying , Aw , go ahead . " So he gambled and decided not to wear one . Richard Levinson , administrator of Preventive Health Services for the D.C. Commission on Public Health , spends his days figuring out how to reach people like Kelly . " We try to make people understand that this message about safe sex does n't just apply to the general population but to them individually . The message is clearly out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your number of sexual partners . " Levinson adds that every time Kelly tests negative for HIV , " it reinforces the idea in his head that he is immune . But he 's not . Having some good luck does n't change your odds if you continue to engage in risky behavior . " On most nights there 's a card party at Kelly 's place . Nothing organized . Anybody who wants to play simply makes his or her way to his basement apartment at around 8 P.Mt. on any given day . If there are only two people , they 'll play tonk . A couple more people , it 'll be spades . Except when Kelly plans to have company . Then the basement becomes the " hit room . " He switches the music from rap to jazz , turns off all the lights , except the red one , and burns incense to make the atmosphere " more erotic . " Many women will insist that the man they 're having sex with wear a condom , or else all bets are off . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadow of a doubt that he will have to use a condom . " It 's not the way they look . There is this energy , some type of vibe I get that makes me put on a condom . " But there are other women who do n't give off the vibe or make the choice . Instead , they leave the decision up to the man . With a guy like Kelly , it 's a judgment call . But when it 's the angel versus the devil , he says , " I usually go with the devil . " If one of his hit-room guests insists he wear a condom , he 'll oblige and pull out his " bag of tricks " -a worn brown-paper sack stuffed with about 200 Trojans . He says he has so many because " let 's face it , I do n't use them often . " Sometimes Kelly takes his show on the road-up to Philadelphia or maybe over to Chicago . One time in Philly , he went to a club , met a woman and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a condom . They exchanged phone numbers but only talked often enough to plan his return visit , a few months later . Kelly was disappointed the next time he saw her . " Did I mention that I was drunk when I met her ? " he says . " Now I 'm sober , and I 'm not happy . " The woman who welcomed him that Saturday night in North Philly , after his three-hour bus ride from D.C. , was not the woman he remembered . Kelly prefers women who are " cultural , " well-read , with a good understanding of the African-American experience . This woman was too " ghetto " for his tastes . " When I first met her she had on a business suit and sunglasses . She looked kinda cool , " he says . His voice drops a few octaves as he describes his second visit . " This time she looked like one of the young ladies from Fly Girl International magazine . She had gold rings on every finger . Gold chains . I was n't impressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spent time talking over dinner at a fast-food restaurant . " I got the chance to hang out with her and learn about the person I was sleeping with , " he says . " She was uncouth . I did n't want to be close to someone like her , so I decided we should remain friends . " Then they had sex . The cheese steaks were n't all that great , he recalls . But the sex was " magnificent . " Last summer , while waiting for the results of his latest HIV test , Kelly thought about what he 'd do if it was negative : Celebrate . He always celebrates the same way : sex with a woman of his choice . He may use a condom , he may not . He waits to hear what the voices say . But the woman he chooses has to be someone he has just met-a new challenge , to make it a true celebration . Because of budget cuts , Kelly 's clinic has to use another lab for HIV test analysis . So instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must wait three . But the day finally comes . He says his heart feels as if it has stopped , just the way it has felt six times previously . Though he 's joking and trying to smile , he seems nervous . Then the counselor appears , and Kelly is motioned back to the same cubicle he visited three weeks ago , this time for post-test counseling and , finally , his results . " I am scared as hell , " he mouths on the way to the cubicle . When he reappears , he is clearly relieved . He releases a deep sigh and holds the pink lab slip , with the words HIV-1/2 ANTIBODY NONREACTIVE , in front of him like a trophy , the ultimate prize in his game of chance . But within a month Kelly again had unprotected sex with a woman he met at a Saturday-night party . She was drinking a wine cooler . They talked . She said his lips were lickable . He said hers were , too . They eventually made their way from the living room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soon there was no more talking . Just each one testing the other 's theory that their lips were indeed lickable . Kelly says he heard the voices he always hears . " The devil popped up on my shoulder , " he says . " A part of me was saying , Go get a condom , and another part was saying , Man , if you leave you are not going to have an opportunity like this again . Seize it and pray for a miracle . " Needless to say , I seized the opportunity , " he adds . This is how diseases are sexually transmitted . The woman Kelly was with that night later explained that she almost never has sex without a condom , unless it is with her boyfriend of six years . But there are exceptions , such as that one time with Kelly . " I was n't drunk , " she says , " but I had been drinking . I had no idea I was going to end up having sex with someone that night . That was the furthest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just talking , she says , when the conversation turned to sex . The next thing she knew , she was being escorted to the bathroom . Kelly says it was that fateful night in a cramped bathroom that forced him to make a beeline for D.C. General 's STD clinic , first thing Tuesday morning . He had contracted a urinary tract infection . " I felt kinda dumb for getting myself into that situation , " he says . " But I am man enough to take responsibility for it , and I thought I should be man enough to let her know . " Kelly 's **30;563;TOOLONG woman is certain that if Kelly caught an infection from her , then she must have caught it from her boyfriend . This is n't the first infection her partner has transmitted to her . The first year they were together , he gave her chlamydia . Their relationship has never been exclusive , which is why every now and then someone will catch something from someone else and pass it on to a third party . It 's like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone it doan with these other women , " she complains about her not-so-steady man . She 's fairly certain that he probably has unprotected sex with the others . She knows her man well . He does n't like to wear condoms . She does n't trust him to ever be monogamous . But they 've been together for so long she does n't see a reason to start protecting herself now . She admits she 's aware of the consequences and baffled by her own behavior . " I may sound crazy to you , but that 's how it is . " Today , two years since Kelly first shared his story , he 's still HIV-negative and in some ways he has matured . He 's writing a book of short stories and works as a full-time news assistant in Washington . He has cut back on his volunteer work to spend more time with his two young nephews . He also says he 's less promiscuous . " I guess after my grandmother 's death last year , I have n't taken that many risks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've become more spiritual . It 's funny how death can make you realize life 's meaning . " These days he 's spending a lot of time with one woman , a person he cares about and does n't want to get pregnant . But he 's quick to say he 's not seeing her exclusively-and that from time to time he still has sex without a condom .
