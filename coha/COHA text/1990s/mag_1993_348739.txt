CINEMA <P> Dirty Harriet Makes Her Day <P> THERE 'S PERHAPS NO POINT TO POINT OF NO RETURN . It 's a remake of an unimprovably stylish , very entertaining thriller  --  La Femme Nikita  --  that was released just two years ago . But hey , that was in French . Why not let people who hate subtitles in on the fun ? Bridget Fonda is a sort of Dirty Harriet , a reprieved murderer turned into an elegant assassin by a mysterious government agency . She and her handler ( Gabriel Byrne ) fall into unconsummated love . She sublimates with gunplay while growing wistful for normality . John Badham 's film seems to have more firepower and slightly softer edges than the original . But the possibly liberating subtext , that a woman is entitled to be sexy and violent just like a male action star , is intact  --  and well played by Fonda . <P> TELEVISION <P> Ditso from the Start <P> HEDDA GABLER , A FIERCELY INDEPENdent woman trapped in bourgeois-marriage hell , keeps a set of pistols around the house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes off . The tragedy may be inevitable , but a new MASTERPIECE THEATRE production of Ibsen 's classic play ( PBS , March 28 ) is possibly the first to make it seem like a blessed relief . Fiona Shaw 's self-absorbed , unsympathetic portrayal makes Hedda ditso from the start : darting , distracted gestures , nervous facial tics and a voice that drops to an inaudible whisper about every third line . Stephen Rea ( The Crying Game ) is more engaging as the dissolute scholar who once loved her , but Deborah Warner 's dark , eccentric production defeats him too . <P> MUSIC <P> Changing Horses <P> WHAT 'S HAPPENED TO THE GLAMOROUS young German violinist ANNE-SOPHIE MUTTER ? She used to be just another pretty face , riding to glory aboard great war- horses named Beethoven , Tchaikovsky and Brahms . On her latest Deutsche Grammophon album , though , she harnesses two modern violin concertos and tames them both . In Alban Berg 's ineffable 1935 two-movement concerto , a requiem for the daughter of Alma Mahler Gropius , Mutter evokes the music 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time Chant , written for her last year , Mutter 's splendid fiddle soars ethereally over the Chicago Symphony led by James Levine . Can it be that , as the millennium dawns , 20th century music is not so tough after all ? <P> MUSIC <P> Heroes at a Hootenanny <P> IT IS NOT AS THOUGH NANCI GRIFFITH ever forsook her folk roots . She was just worried that others would forget , and that her younger fans might never know . So , with Other Voices , Other Rooms , she pays homage to her heroes , those folk stars who sang to her from her bedside radio when she was a Texas teenager . Some of her honorees even come to the party . Bob Dylan plays harmonica on his almost forgotten Boots of Spanish Leather . John Prine sings harmony on his Speed of the Sound of Loneliness . Arlo Guthrie sings on Tecumseh Valley , by Townes Van Zandt , though not on his father Woody 's Do Re Mi . Griffith blends her voice with these and others to bring something new to the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Impossible Choices
