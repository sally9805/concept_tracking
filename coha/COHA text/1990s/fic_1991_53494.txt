EARLY IN MARCH Tom Mays decided to go fishing alone at Kirkland Lake in northern Ontario , where he had been taking his family on summer vacations for more than a decade . In the months before his solitary trip , he had not been sleeping , and Vera , his wife , suggested that perhaps he was troubled by some secret disaster or long-forgotten failure . She thought it might help him to talk to Dr. Malone , a very good family counselor who had truly saved her the year before , when she had been unable to accept the death of her mother . " Perhaps talking to a professional will soothe you , " Vera said , and her words  --  her confidence that something could be done  --  temporarily altered his sense of helplessness . <p> He could not admit that his nerves were shattered , but he gave in and called the doctor . In the beginning , the talks with Dr. Malone pleased him . He was preserving his happiness against a nameless fright . For a while he took each day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features and good suggestions for dinner . The mornings came to him with gradual sunlight , and he stood by his bed stretching himself like a cat awakened briefly from sleep . <p> But then on a cold Saturday morning in early February , his right eyelid began to twitch  --  a tremor so slight he could not see it in the mirror , though it felt as if his eye were blinking . He could not concentrate on anything , so his work suffered . He started making mistakes , and he had difficulty listening to his clients . All day he tugged at the delicate skin over his eye as though something burned there . <p> If he had not become a stockbroker he might have claimed to be a poet . He had always been a conscious reader ; he liked it whenever people noticed that he had a way with words . And every now and then he 'd spend an afternoon or so writing lines of verse . But he was very good at his job . His clients trusted him , and he made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The money provided a fine house , beautiful furniture , and the Canadian vacations for his family . Also , he sent his children to the best possible private schools . <p> There was nothing particularly disturbing about his family , except that his children were growing too fast and now they saw him more often as an adversary : as the one who sets limits , rather than provider and protector . He did not like the extraordinary changes his children underwent each day , but there was no reason to deny the fact that his life was basically happy and normal . His family had been relatively free of tragedy until Vera 's mother died . And even then Tom believed the loss was more or less normal  --  part of what he called the " everyday pain and frustration of life and change . " He tried to console Vera by pointing out how good their lives were , and how the loss of her mother , though terribly sad , might finally be the fulfillment of a kind of earthbound perfection : the pattern of existence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept it , " he told her . <p> When he developed the twitch over his eye , business had not been wonderful , but it had been steady , as it had been many times before in the past . Consulting people about investments is a seasonal and cyclical thing . In spite of the danger of his work in perilous financial times , Tom was not afraid of losing his job . It never crossed his mind , although in the weeks before he took his vacation his commissions had begun to drop off slightly . Every day it became easier to sit at his desk and scribble on his white desk pad . He would write draft after draft of what he hoped would be a great poem , while holding a Kleenex over his right eye to keep it still . He was certain that if he could only get one good night 's sleep , the twitch would stop . <p> And then Dr. Malone told him he should get away . Go on a fishing trip by himself and take hold of his life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I would n't even take the family , " Malone said . " Just take a week to re-create yourself . Get away from pressures . " <p> " I would n't want to go alone , " Tom said . <p> " Do what you want , what you believe will most relax you . " <p> For a long time Tom did n't answer . Then he said , " I suppose you know best . " <p> Vera taught ninth-grade English all day and although she was concerned about her husband 's nerves , it was after all just his nerves . She made a habit of rubbing his forehead in the evening after supper and singing to him . Each night was devoted to getting him to sit still and relax . She listened to his poems , was even moved by some of them . She was not a particularly attractive woman  --  her hair was curly and coarse , and it sometimes gathered in odd shapes on the top of her head when she was too busy to wash it . But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could engage him in ways no other woman ever could . He liked to hear her talk ; the soft rhythms of her vowels and consonants played on his consciousness like intricate music . And she was extremely articulate and sensible . <p> Vera was disconsolate when Tom told her about his intended trip to Canada . She did not believe in separate vacations and told him so . <p> " It 's not really a vacation , darling , " he said . " The doctor just thinks it will do me good to get away and relax . " <p> " And that 's not a vacation ? " <p> " I 'm not going up there to have fun . " <p> " Are you going to fish ? " <p> " It helps me relax . " <p> She stood in front of him , holding her hands together at her waist . After an awkward pause , and with a worried look , she said , " I want you to feel better . I do . It just frightens me . " <p> He held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The truth is , when he crossed the border into Canada , he had a sick feeling high up in his stomach and it terrified him . He was afraid he was having a heart attack . The twitch in his eye seemed calmer for most of the trip , but as he progressed up the Q.E.W. toward Toronto , he could not stop thinking about his stammering heart . He was so terribly alone , traversing a part of the country that he had enjoyed yearly with his family most of his married life . He missed having people he loved around him , and this added to the weakness he felt in his heart . He saw other families , cars with luggage carriers and turtle tops  --  children peering out of back windows . He thought if Vera could see him now she would not worry about his being away from her . This was only another kind of terror . Everything he looked upon made him wish for the opportunity to proffer tenderness , to show his love . <p> A mile or so north of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a lonely station just off the road . He purposely did not stop in Temagami , where the family had always stopped before . He hoped something about this strange location would restore him , provide a source of increasing power  --  the power to be alone for a time , and without his family . <p> It was late in the afternoon , and he had been tracing the actions of his more tranquil heart for some time . Although he still felt sick to his stomach , the fear had settled . Anxiety sometimes left him so suddenly he had begun to refer to it as a " spell . " All his life he had believed that fear came to him because of some circumstance in his daily existence  --  his diet , or too much liquor  --  but lately he had come to see that it behaved in him without stimulus and for no reason he could name , This only intensified his dread of it . <p> Except for a lone attendant , the gas station was empty . Behind it , a stand of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high white clouds making shadows on jagged hills in the distance . <p> " Ohio , " the attendant said , looking at his plates . He was an old man with red , graying hair . <p> " Yeah . Cleveland . " <p> " Where you headed ? " <p> " Up there . " He pointed to the hills . " I 'm going fishing . " <p> " Good time to go . Early in the year . " <p> There was a strong breeze . Tom stood by the back of his car and watched the number clicking on the gas pump . He wanted to be talking . <p> " I 'm going up to Kirkland Lake . <p> " The old man did n't answer . <p> " I go fishing up there every year . " <p> " It 's a lot colder up there . " The attendant finished and put the nozzle back in its cradle . " Eighteen seventy-five . " He grabbed the bill of his cap in the wind and pulled it down to shade his eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Well , good luck . " The old man took Tom 's money and counted out the change . <p> " You ever go fishing up there ? " Tom asked . <p> The old man frowned . " I do n't have time for that shit . " He gave a sarcastic laugh . " I got to work , man . " <p> Tom got back in his car , started the engine . As he pulled out he saw the old man watching him from the station window and he had an odd sensation of having lived here : of being old and busy with survival , finding nothing important , finished with almost everything . <p> When he got to the lake it was nearly dark , and loneliness cooled his blood like fear . He walked into the lodge , found Thaddeus Scott , the owner of the camp and by now a good friend of the family , seated at a small desk writing in a ledger . " Well , I see you made it , " he said , putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the family ? " <p> " I 'm by myself . " <p> " You do n't say . " He seemed disappointed . He enjoyed the Mays family , had come to love them during the ritual of more than ten August vacations . Tom 's kids called him " Taddy " and " Uncle Tad . " In the last few years the boys went with him through the portages to carry gas to the boats on the back lakes . He was nearing seventy , and the gas cans were beginning to be too heavy for him . Years before he knew the Mays family he had been married , and he often told Tom that if his wife had lived , he might have had a family just like his . <p> " You 're getting an early start this year , ay ? " Scott said . He had a flat , Indian-looking face and gray hair pushed back on both sides . His hairline was perfect and made a widow 's peak a little too low on his brow . He was a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How 's it been ? " <p> " You got the lakes to yourself . The place is empty . " <p> " You been out ? " <p> " Last Saturday . Caught a few small ones . You sure you want cabin one ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " The usual cabin would be a lot more comfortable . " <p> " I do n't want to stay where we always stay , " Tom said . <p> Cabin one rested on a stony hill overlooking the black shore of the lake . It took him a while to get settled in . He unpacked everything , then changed into a flannel shirt , Levi 's , a pair of leather boots . In the tiny bathroom , where he had set out his shaving kit , a toothbrush , and toothpaste , he stood in front of the dirty mirror and combed his hair . He felt as though the whole trunk of his body were hollow and every sound he made in the empty cabin echoed there . <p> He stepped out onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the sky was still very bright from the moon . The air was filled with the odor of pine sap and hickory . Down the dirt and rock-strewn path in front , lined with pine and white birch , Tom thought he could trace the tiny , vanished footprints of his distant children . <p> On his first day in the empty camp , he did not go fishing . He lay in his cabin , staring at the sky through a black screen . He told himself he needed to rest from the long drive . That morning , when he had given up sleeping , he had walked up to the main lodge and bought a bottle of Scott 's whiskey and a pack of cigarettes . For most of the morning he was conscious of the full bottle sitting in the middle of the small table by the stove . He decided to try to write , but once he had the paper on the table and a pencil in his hand , the idea weakened him . He smoked a few of the cigarettes , tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he got up and opened the bottle . He poured himself a drink and lit another cigarette , then went out onto the front porch of the cabin . Scott was nowhere to be seen . it was very cold . Beyond the black shadows of the tall pines , the lake looked almost silver in the pale sun , and white clouds gathered above the pointed trees . <p> He fished alone all of the next day . Once , while he was trolling , a pike hit his line and he fought with it for a time , not really wanting to bring it in . He was glad when the fish twisted off and disappeared in the murky water . He caught a few small bass but took them off his lure and threw them back . Shortly after noon it began to rain . He turned off the motor and let the boat drift . Although there was not much wind , dark clouds shoved the tips of the trees and swirled above the high rocks . Water dripped into the lake quietly all around him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drifting very slightly , and the rhythm of the dripping rain soothing him , he fell asleep . He never stopped hearing the spattering rain , and he did not dream . His head ached from the whiskey he 'd drunk the day before , and he woke up wishing for a cigarette . He realized he was very near the shoreline , and as he turned to start the motor he saw something moving in the black glistening trees . Water dripped off his hat into his face , and he could not see clearly . It was an animal , a rust-colored creature that went into the brush between two great stones . <p> He watched for it as he came to remember what it was , what it must be . He muttered out loud , " That was a cougar . " As if the animal heard him , it rose out of the dark brush and leapt to the top of one of the mosscovered stones . For a very slight fraction of time they looked at one another . Then the cougar lowered its head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up once more and was gone . <p> That night Tom lay down on one of the beds in his cabin and watched out the window as the moon rose from behind a ragged edge of black pines . The moon was stained and pale , as if the rain had washed away some of its luster . He lay there for a long time , thinking about the cougar , remembering the lithe , almost soft-looking shape as it leaped up onto the stone , remembering the cougar 's serious , amber eyes and the way it had looked at him . It was almost recognition  --  as if the cougar knew him , knew all about him . <p> He spent the third day working on a new poem . The rain had brushed the sky absolutely clean , but it turned very cold during the night . He tried to write about the rain , the long night listening to it drip off the trees , loving Vera so much it hurt him to remember her , but he could n't concentrate . His right eye buzzed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twitch had returned while he was showering that morning . He had scrubbed his eye furiously , as if it offended him on purpose . As he was stepping out of the shower he thought he saw something move outside the fogged window . He did n't pay much attention to it until he sat down to write , but as he sketched with the pencil and considered the first word for his poem , he came to believe that he had seen the cougar that morning . <p> So he stared at the empty paper in front of him and rubbed his eye , thinking about the cougar  --  about the way it moved in stealth all its life , about years of silence under pure white clouds in the high blue dome over northern Ontario . He thought about his own silence  --  day after day of it . <p> Much later in the afternoon he was startled by a sudden knock on the door . He knew it must be Scott , but he put his papers in the drawer by the stove anyway , then got out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " What 're you up to ? " Scott had a bottle of his own , two cigars . <p> They smoked the cigars and sipped whiskey until nightfall . They talked mostly about fishing , Canadian winters , outboard motors , the merits of aluminum boats . When Tom noticed it was dark outside , he snuffed what was left of his cigar and stood up and stretched . " God , my back is tight and sore . " <p> " You going to eat ? " Scott said . <p> " I was going to make a snack . " <p> Scott looked around the room . " You brought food ? " <p> " Some bread , cheese . Stuff like that . " <p> " I 'll cook something . If you want . You do n't look so good , and bread and cheese is n't  --  " <p> " I 'm fine , " Tom said , rubbing the small of his back . He was feeling the whiskey , and all he wanted was to lie down on the bed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only he were left alone . <p> " Are you all right ? " Scott said . <p> " I 'm just tired . That 's all . " <p> " You should get some sleep . " <p> " Well , " Tom said . " So I should . " <p> There was a silence , while they looked at one another . Then Scott got up to leave . <p> " I 'm sorry . " Tom felt as though he had driven his visitor out . " I guess I 'm not so very well . " <p> " What 's wrong , anyway ? " Scott came back toward him . <p> " Nothing . I 've just been working today , that 's all . " <p> " You said you came to relax . " <p> " Here . " Tom held up the bottle of whiskey . " Have one more drink . " <p> They sipped silently . When they were finished , Scott took hold of Tom 's hand and shook it firmly . It was his way of renewing whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Scott was turning to leave , Tom said , " By the way , I saw a cougar out there yesterday . " <p> Scott laughed . " You mean you thought you saw one . " <p> " No , I really did . " <p> " Not this far east . " <p> " They 're probably all over this country . " <p> " I 've been here all my life and I 've never seen one . " <p> " I guess I was lucky . " Tom poured himself another drink , sat back down at the table . <p> " If you change your mind about dinner , " Scott said . Then he smiled and went out the door . <p> The next day they both went fishing . The lake was choppy and the boat rocked as they trolled along the shaded shores and rock shoals . They did n't talk much until they had landed on one of the islands to eat the sandwiches Scott had packed for them . <p> When they had finished eating , Tom lay down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to block out the bright sun . <p> " You going to sleep ? " Scott said . <p> " No . " <p> " I heard you walking around last night . " <p> Tom did n't answer . A sweeping breeze slapped water against the rock shoreline below them . He listened to every sound , tried to consecrate all of his senses to what seemed like the whole earth beneath him . He did not feel anything . <p> " I thought you were an animal at first , " Scott said . " But then I saw you out the window , walking around in the moonlight with that flashlight . " <p> " What were you doing up so late ? " <p> " I was up . I do n't know , " Scott said . <p> " I thought I saw that cougar yesterday morning . So last night I took the flashlight with me . " <p> " If there 's a cougar up here , he wo n't come near the camp . " <p> " I 've seen it twice already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Maybe so . " <p> " I 'm not a tourist , " Tom said . " i 've been up here enough to know what I 'm seeing . " <p> " Did I say anything ? I just wish I could see one . " <p> " It 's a big one . " <p> " You did n't see him last night ? " <p> " No . I just walked around . " <p> " You looked like a spirit . " <p> It was quiet for a long time , and Tom felt himself drifting , his mind a blinking eye on a blue shade . He might have lost consciousness for a fraction of a second , but then he remembered where be was . The strong odor of sweat in the creases of the hat covering his face , and the heat of the direct sun on his body , waked him . With his eyes wide open , and the hat still over his face , he said , " it 's peaceful here . " <p> " Yeah . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 've been wanting to ask you , and tell me to shut up if you want , but how come you did n't bring the wife and kids ? " <p> Tom removed the cap and got to his feet . He slapped the hat against his thigh , as though he were pounding dust out of it , and he was absolutely stunned to hear himself saying , " Vera and I are separated . We 're getting a divorce . " <p> " Oh , no shit . " Scott spoke fast , as if to forestall him . " I 'm sorry . I really am . " <p> There was an awkward silence . Then Tom said , " It 's just one of those things . We 're trying to work it out . " The words seemed to rush out of his mouth before he could recognize them . Each one shocked him-as though he discovered himself speaking a language he had never heard . " You know the last few years , we just lost it . There are so many things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why do n't you tell her ? " <p> " And I do n't think she 's happy . I really do n't . " <p> " I 'm terribly sorry to hear it . I 'm so sorry . " <p> " Everything changes and empties out so damned fast , you know ? " And just like that Tom believed himself ; heat rose in his throat and the most profound sadness overcame him . He stepped down to the edge of the water , picked up a good flat stone and skipped it out into the murmuring lake . He got control of his grief , but he did not wish to be where anyone could see him . He heard Scott , just a few feet behind him , setting their gear back into the boat , and shame filtered into his heart like a drug . <p> " Well , " Scott said , " we better shove off . " <p> Tom and Vera had never even discussed separation , nor was there any serious breach in their marriage . In fact , though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some animal that would swallow him up , his relationship with Vera was perhaps the only thing that sustained him . So he was troubled by the lie  --  both because it felt like a betrayal of her love , and because he did not understand what it revealed about himself . The lie was not a conscious choice . The words seemed to come out of his mouth like something willful , escaping . Still , he felt contemptible and even humiliated  --  as if he were made foolish by forces beyond his control and the whole universe laughed at him . He spent the rest of the afternoon marveling over his lie , and further complicating it because of Scott 's endless curiosity . <p> " How does something like that begin , anyway ? " Scott said . <p> " Something like what ? " <p> " Divorce . Separation . " <p> " I do n't know . We 're not divorced yet . Maybe we 'll work it out . " <p> " Are you seeing a counselor ? " <p> " I am . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died last year . " <p> " Is that when the problem started ? " <p> " It 's not one problem . Anyway , we 're only separated . There 's a possibility we 'll get back together . " <p> They fished only half-heartedly , letting the boat drift over a shoal in a narrow section of the lake . Scott kept shaking his head , staring down into the dark water . " I never would have believed it , " he said . " You two were  --  " He looked up at Tom . " It 's a crying shame . " <p> " Let 's talk about something else . " <p> " Are you involved with somebody else ? " " No . " " Is she ? " <p> " No . It 's nothing like that . " <p> Scott shrugged , leaned over again to stare into the water . " I always thought you liked each other . " <p> " We 're just different . " <p> " Everybody 's different . " <p> " Why do n't we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tom 's eyelid started buzzing again . He looked out over the brassy lake and tried to figure out why he had told such a pointless lie . As he reflected on it , by degrees he became aware of its true consequences : he would be bringing his family back here in August . Scott would have a chance to talk to Vera , and he would certainly mention it ; he might even offer fatherly encouragement . And it was no use trying to avoid the lake in August . He could not very well decide suddenly not to go to Canada , or worse , choose another camp for their vacation . Perhaps the children would n't mind so much , but Vera would not stand for it . She saw the whole vacation as a sort of " end of the year " ritual , and she loved their usual cabin , the shape of the tiny inlet where the camp was located , and Scott . Sometimes she even called him " Taddy . " <p> No . Tom could not announce to everyone that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insist on missing that year in Canada , either . He 'd only have next year to worry about . <p> The more he pondered these consequences , the more he realized he was hating himself . But he also felt a numbing and intense dislike for Scott , whose face now seemed almost haunting : the way his leathery mouth hung slightly open , the glassy gaze of his weathered eyes . And then the old man said something quietly to himself  --  as though he spoke to an object in the water  --  and Torn felt a sudden and extraordinary rush of affection for him . He almost laughed out loud with it . He felt sorry for Scott 's bewilderment and shock , and if he had not feared the consequences of incurring the old man 's disrespect , he might have told him right then that it was n't true . <p> In the evening , while the sun turned pale yellow and sank beneath a blue wreath of clouds , Tom sat by himself on the front porch of cabin one , a glass of whiskey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relaxed , unafraid , almost happy . He should be happy , he told himself . The twitch in his eye had subsided during the afternoon , and he had caught a good-sized pike . Scott caught several walleye , and he said he would " cook them up special " the following night , Tom 's last in camp . There was cheer in his voice when he said that , and Tom realized that the most awkward moments had passed , and with them the last opportunity to confess his lie . <p> As he sipped his whiskey in the diminishing sun he was shocked to see the cougar again . This time it was across the lake , perched on a jutting piece of white driftwood . It calmly licked its dark paw , then settled itself in a purely graceful repose , its head high , its front legs sleek and perfectly aligned . In the distance the cougar seemed very small , and an evening mist threatened to drift in front of it and mask it altogether . <p> Tom put the whiskey down and moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fearful that the great cat would be startled by sudden movement . He could not call to Scott , but he wanted desperately for him to see it . <p> But the mist gathered and thickened as it drifted in , and by the time Scott came down the front steps of the lodge , the mist had cloaked the far shore so that the cougar was barely visible . <p> " That 's not a cougar , " Scott said . <p> " Yes it is . Look at it . " <p> Scott leaned down , moved toward the bank of the lake , squinting his eyes . " It 's a doe . Is n't it ? Or a shadow from the pines ? " <p> " It 's a goddamned mountain lion , " Tom said . <p> " Well , it 's hard to tell from here . " <p> " You think I 'm lying about it ? " " No . " <p> " I would n't lie about it . " <p> Scott looked at him . " You might be wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a sharp , impatient tone in his voice . <p> " That 's the third time I 've seen it , " Tom said . <p> " I do n't see anything there now . " <p> The mist was very thick , and now even Tom could not make out the tawny shape of the cougar . It had probably gone back into the dark . " Goddamn , " he said . " I saw it . I know what it was . " <p> There was a long pause while Scott watched the white mist scattering across the lake . Then he said , " Well . You going out tomorrow ? " <p> " No . I 'm going to pack up and rest for the trip home . " <p> " You packing already ? " <p> " Look , " Tom blurted . " I owe you an apology . " He was in a hurry to get the words out . " Do n't ask me why , but I made up that story about me and Vera . I was  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the half-light from the sinking sun his eyes seemed cold and lifeless . <p> " What ? " <p> " I just talked to her . " <p> Tom felt something slight drop in his heart . " You told her ? " <p> " I did n't mean to , but I 'm glad now that I did . " <p> " I would n't leave Vera for anything . " He found it very difficult to stand before Scott 's eyes . <p> " Well you ought to tell her that . " <p> " What did you say to her ? " <p> " I asked her what was going on , and she did n't seem to want to talk about it . f told her I knew all about it . But she made me tell her what I knew , so I did . " <p> " What 'd she say ? " <p> " She cried a little bit . I do n't think she had any idea what was going on . She might believe it . " <p> There was a slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not true . " <p> " Maybe . She called to see how you were . " " Why did n't you come and get me ? " <p> " She did n't want me to tell you we 'd talked . She thought it might upset you . " Scott ran his hand through his thick hair , glanced only briefly at Tom , then walked back toward the lodge . At the bottom of the porch steps , he turned and said , " I 've got a group coming in tomorrow so I 'll be pretty busy . If you change your mind about going out , help yourself to one of the boats . " He waved his hand , walked unsteadily up the steps , pausing now and then as though he needed to gather courage to keep going , as though he were returning to some happy place with news of disaster and defeat . <p> Shortly after nightfall Tom found the courage to go to the lodge and try to call Vera , but there was no answer . He did not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children were . He tried several of their friends , his mother and father , Vera 's father . Each call he made seemed to multiply the urgency of his need to talk to her . <p> Vera 's father said , " What the hell 's going on between you two ? " " I just wondered if you 'd seen her . " <p> " No , I have n't . What are you doing in Canada this time of year ? " <p> " If she calls tell her I love her . " <p> " You going to tell me what 's going on ? " <p> " I ca n't now , " Tom said . " Please . " Then he hung up the phone . He did not care what sort of alarm he was creating by these frantic calls . He wanted everyone to know that he loved her and would never leave her . <p> It was late in the evening when he finally reached her at home . <p> " Where 'd you go ? " he said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kids . " <p> There was a silence , then she said , " Are you all right , dear ? " <p> He told her he was fine .

" <p> " Well ... " She paused again . " I do n't know . I just do n't know . " <p> " I love you , " Tom said . He felt his voice weakening . " You know I 'd never leave you . " <p> " Yes , " she said . " But I 'm afraid you want to . " <p> He tried to say no . Nothing would give in his throat , and the sadness of her small and distant voice echoed in his heart . All he could say was , " For Christ 's sake , Vera . " <p> There was another long pause . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He saw her smiling and offering him tenderness . He could not picture her any other way . <p> Finally she said , " What are you doing all the way up there ? " <p> " I 'll be home , " he said . " I 'm leaving in the morning . " <p> " We 'll talk when you get here . " <p> " I do n't want to talk about it , " he said . " I want to forget it . " <p> Toward dawn he was sitting at the table in his cabin trying to work when he thought he heard a slight ticking noise behind him . He stretched in his chair , tried to bend his spine which had become as inflexible as a beam of wood . In front of him on the table were several white sheets of paper . He had been searching for the right word . The perfect word to begin . <p> He sensed the light coming to the windows . At first he did not look for the source of the ticking sound . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper in front of him . His skull seemed ready to explode , and he felt an electric charge at the base of each hair . On the table next to him was a neatly stacked pile of papers , each with one or two words written at the top . He was not the sort of writer who crumbled up failures and threw them on the floor . Except for the empty whiskey bottle , a stack of cigarette butts in the ashtray , and a few battered pencils , the room looked barely lived in . <p> He had been working since midnight , without stopping . There had been a brief period shortly after three when he thought he might fall asleep , but he worked through it . He had come to believe that when he was finished he would have the best poem he could write . It would be the only offering from him ; it would break his silence . Then he would offer it to Vera , and she would understand him . She would finally know what it was in him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the sky turned white beyond the earth 's rim , he rubbed his face with both hands and tried to see the paper clearly again . His eye twitched slightly , almost a reminder of corporeal things , of the need for sleep . Then he wrote , " I love you Vera . I love you Vera . I love you Vera . " He was writing furiously when he heard a new sound at the window behind him . A soft , padded and muffled thing slapped tile pane . He froze for a moment , listening . He heard the sound again , as though someone wearing thick gloves knocked on the glass . With sudden horror , he rose from the chair , still not turning to the window . He was immediately conscious of his stuttering heart , his bloodless hands . The cabin was freezing cold , and the linoleum floor seemed to breathe beneath him . He knew , before he turned , what it was at the window . It made a grunting noise , deep and terrible , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the hard , aging wood . <p> For a long time he stared at the empty window . It did n't seem as though his heart would ever stop pounding . He stretched out on the bed , feeling feverish and alone . With his arm crossed over his forehead , covering his eyes , he thought of Vera  --  the harmony in her voice . He pictured her with young children , touching them with her tender , fine-boned hands . He saw her holding one of his own babies , years ago , smiling for him . He remembered the look on her face when she knew her mother was dead . And then he was crying . He felt like a child , ashamed of his tears . Turning to the wall he covered his face with a pillow . Thus , for once and finally , he fell into a deep sleep . <p> He was awakened by the late afternoon sun , heated through the glass on the front door . He did n't remember lying down , or how he got to the cot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory as though it were a dream . He was n't sure at first if he remembered the difference between wakefulness and sleep ; the whole night , all of the hours of writing and rewriting seemed dreamlike to him . <p> But when he sat up , he saw the pile of papers on the table and his senses came swimming back . He was cold . He had not eaten anything since the sandwiches on the island the day before , so he felt hollow and fragile inside , as if he were the husk of an insect . And he knew the cougar had come to the front porch of his cabin . <p> Outside it was breezy and still cold . The trees whispered like running water , and the boats pushed by the wind struck against the dock . Tom emerged from the cabin carrying all the paper from the table . It was wrapped in newspaper and bundled up like cleaned fish . <p> He walked to a black trash barrel next to the gasoline shed . There was a blue Lincoln parked by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarettes and talking . He knew the women were watching him . They laughed , and he felt small and terribly alone and vulnerable . <p> The thought of eating fish that night with Scott turned in him like a vague presentiment of death . He would not do it . He wished he was home and in Vera 's arms . <p> He lifted the top of the trash barrel and dropped the bundle in . It made a hollow sound that rivaled the striking boats . He replaced the lid , turned to look once more at the black lake churning in the wind , and then he walked back to his cabin and began packing for the long journey home . He had already made up his mind that he would not tell Scott about the cougar . And he would not tell anyone . <p> <p> By ROBERT BAUSCH <p>
