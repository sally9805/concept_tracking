The rules are different here is a slogan Miami has used to lure tourists . Unfortunately , city officials seem to think it applies to them as well . One of the mayor 's chief foes , a Cuban-American multimillionaire , once offered to settle their feud with a duel in Central America . A few years ago , when city bureaucrats squabbled over jobs , voodoo dolls with tiny nooses began appearing at City Hall . And Miami officials were caught buying stolen designer clothing for pennies on the dollar in a scandal known as " Hot Suits . " <P> Now Miami 's tradition of unruly official behavior is finally bringing painful consequences . After years of reckless financial management and a bribery scandal that produced federal charges against three top city officials , South Florida 's largest city stands on the edge of bankruptcy , with a $68 million budget shortfall and bonds that have been downgraded to junk . Last week Florida Governor Lawton Chiles declared Miami to be in a " fiscal emergency " and said he would name a financial control board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's last chance to save itself ; a grass-roots movement of Miami citizens has gained support for a proposal to dissolve Miami into surrounding Dade County and do away with city government . <P> Miami is the fourth poorest city in the U.S. , mainly because anybody with any money has long since moved out of town . Miami Beach , a separate municipality , has most of the area 's prime beaches and luxury resorts , as well as the hip , Art Deco district of South Beach . Outside a thin necklace of fancy hotels , parks and wealthy enclaves lining the waterfront , Miami comprises largely the kind of inner-city neighborhoods that never make it into the tourist brochures . Middle-class flight  --  first of whites and now of Cubans  --  has made Miami increasingly a city of struggling , often illegal immigrants from Nicaragua , Guatemala and El Salvador . The downtown business district , which pays about 30% of Miami 's taxes , is losing patience . " Taxes in Miami are twice what they are in the county , police and sanitation services are poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " says Gene Stearns , a Miami lawyer and community activist . <P> Even so , much of Miami 's fiscal mess is directly traceable to its uniquely fast-and-loose municipal traditions . A Miami Herald investigation found that in the midst of its current fiscal crisis , the city is still leasing out a good chunk of its $600 million in property to politically connected businesses at well below market rents . Among those who benefit : the Municipios Trust Fund Corp. , a group of prominent Cubans who got a $1-a-year , 20-year lease on city-owned property to build a clubhouse and community center . " The politicians here just give land away to their friends , " says Pan Courtelis , a businessman and a leader of the petition drive to dissolve the city . <P> The city 's financial woes are made worse by recordkeeping so poor that even City Hall ca n't tell where the red ink is leaking . Mayor Joe Carollo , who took office last July and inherited the current financial mess , concedes that the $68 million deficit figure is little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city 's books . " We know less about our checkbook than the average husband and wife do , " says Thomas Tew , a lawyer advising the city .
