Jinsei Wa Fuzen No Tomoshibi ( Life Is a Candle Before the Wind ) <p> When I first visited your country , long before I met you , I had then only the command of one word in your language to take there with me . That word was domo . I simply added a bow to it and improvised my way along . Makino and others will tell you that I improvised so much with that one word , that I am still remembered for bowing and saying domo from Tokyo to Fukuoka . Of course I became a comic figure , but at the same time I gained an area of safety as the bumbling foreigner who must be endured . I was so obviously on the outskirts of things that people wanted to bring me inside . I was thus able to rely on soto as my undefined social status to gain access to several uchis . This was the finest feeling , Kyo , of being invited into the flow of a foreign way of life by total strangers . In Tokyo , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Yoshimeki , Yoichiro Anzai and several other men took me to dinner . Afterwards , over sake and beer , they wanted to sing . I could not remember the last time I had actually sung . But I remembered some songs , and the four of us sang for hours , drawing benign attention to our table . <p> This same transition from soto to uchi occurred with Kio Ono , when he and two of his friends took me to a bar in Osaka . It was a private akachochin , with one mama-san and one very attractive kanban-musume , who served the drinks . Like all such small bars , it catered to a private clientele , the kind of place where everyone is a familiar face . I was the only outsider , under the protection of Kio Ono and his friends . We drank and sang and laughed . I had , by then , learned two new words , both of which were appropriate for this one occasion . I could pour sake and beer and say Dozo , and I could raise my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's two friends-Mr . Yamaoka and Mr. Hirata , who was a dentist-took great pleasure in helping me improvise around my absence of language . Whenever there was a lull in the conversation , whenever they sensed that I was being excluded from the flow of talk , Mr. Hirata would look seriously and sadly at me , and then raise his beer glass to my own and say , " Kampai ! Kampai ! " And the four of us would laugh . <p> When we were sufficiently drunk , Kio Ono asked me to stand up and sing , alone , with the karoake . I had been very careful , until that moment , to patrol against the intrusion of my Western habits into the flow of the communal life . I did not want to be an individual in the flow of the mizushobai , the water trade . Nor did I want to threaten the order of mibun , the social ranking , inside that private place by assuming the role of a nagashi . I did not want to " flow " on the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a context , there was always the danger of disrupting the naturalness , the shizen , of the flow . But on the other hand , I had been invited by Kio Ono , my host , and so I sang . I think I sang , along with the mechanical guidance of the karoake machine , " I Left My Heart In San Francisco , " and drew inspiration for it from the flashing pictures of familiar streets and the Golden Gate Bridge . I sang , but my own version of the song was echoed , in perfect unison and with perfect articulation , by the television that monitored my performance . The machine gave my voice a perfect pitch and intonation , both of which seemed to command the attention of the entire roomful of drinking Japanese men . There was , at the far end of the long bar , a sullen-seeming Japanese man who drank and stared at me while I sang . At the end of my song , he walked deliberately down the length of the bar toward me , still staring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he slapped me several times on my chest and shouted " Bushido ! Bushido ! " Then he ordered the kanban-musume , with the very same sober formality , to give drinks , with his compliments , to me , and to Kio Ono , and to his friends . <p> I had never before in my life been called a warrior . <p> And another time , again in Osaka , while we were touring the Great Market , the " Belly of Osaka , " Kio Ono took me into a Pachinko Parlour . We were separated , and walked independently up and down the rows of people-old and young , men and women in business clothes , Korean laborers , Chinese addicts-bent religiously into the ritual business of feeding the small metal balls into slots and watching their hypnotic flow inside the machines . The quiet intensity of the room , the gentleness of the process , the cacophony of individualized ritual movements , gave the Pachinko Parlour the mood of a church or a sanctuary , where something of great sacredness was being pursued . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left suddenly began paying great sums of coins to a man who seemed to be a laborer . I stopped to watch the flow of coins , the evidence of luck . At the same time the man turned to look up at me . But then , still at the same time , he swept up in his palmed hands a mountain of coins and offered them to me . Only a few seconds had passed , but those few seconds of clock time contained space enough for a flurry of meaningful actions . There was an overabundance of simultaneousness about it . Those few seconds were layered with meaning , a perception that was then almost new to me . I accepted the coins , and bowed to my benefactor , and said " Domo . " But it seemed to me later that the naturalness of the processes , the deep flow of life impulses during those few seconds , the shizen na kimochi , had begun to re-open a view into a dimension of life I had all but closed down or shut out . <p> Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Osaka . In this country , the related word zaibatsu has now acquired demonic associations , because it has become associated with the basic fear of unknown and unseen aliens who lurk in , and lay plots in , the mysterious , shadowy territory beyond the reach of our rational understanding . It used to be the ritual place of the Jew and The Elders of Zion . Now it has become the ritual place of The Elders of Edo . People here have yet to learn that the Japanese business association is made up of human beings . <p> Mr. Takashi Kusaka , Kio Ono 's lifelong friend , is the head of this zaibatsu . He was born poor , but worked very hard , during the boom years , to build a company that manufactured artificial flowers and ornaments for foreign markets . You might have seen some of Mr. Kusaka 's flowers on my mantel here in this house . Ono took me to spend several days and nights in Mr. Kusaka 's home in Osaka . It was a great building , with four or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses , another floor for bedrooms , a third floor for Mr. Kusaka 's mother , who lived with them , and a fourth floor , with many large , barely furnished rooms , for Mr. Kusaka 's workers and for his houseguests . Ono and I slept on the top floor , with other guests . Ono commented that Mr. Kusaka had not changed at all since he was a little boy . He was a warm and generous man , still loyal to his family and friends and to his traditions . He honored the basic rituals and ceremonies of Japanese life , while conforming as much as possible to the modern . There was a dress shop , run by his wife , and a restaurant , run by his workers , on the side of the ground floor of his building . And in the basement there were the traditional Japanese bath , a sauna and a steam room . <p> The morning of our arrival , Mr. Kusaka was off in a small village , his ancestral home , to pay ceremonial respects to his ancestors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relative 's death , a meinichi . When he returned , he took Ono and me on a tour of Buddhist and Shinto shrines near Osaka . Then he took us to a store , where he purchased many delicacies , as omake , for me , as his guest , and for his family and friends . That evening there was a meeting of his business association . The occasion was the celebration of the promotion of one of his younger employees in the thriving business . I was invited by Mr. Kusaka to join the dinner celebration . <p> About ten or fifteen Japanese men met that evening in the private dining room of an Osaka restaurant . The style of Osaka , as you know , differs remarkably from the style of Tokyo . Osaka , close to the Old Capital , still lives in the shadow of Lord Hideyoshi 's Castle ( " the Bald Rat " ) , which still contains the spirit of his presence . Osaka people still look back on his reign , and on their city 's history , before Lord Tokugawa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In my view , Osaka people are more " down to earth " and brisk than people in Tokyo . They strike me as " country people , " defiant in their values and full of mischief and good humor . They laugh easily , as did the Japanese men in Mr. Kusaka 's association . They made a place for me at their table , and showed me the proper way to sit and arrange my feet . They spoke in their own language , and Ono translated for me . They found humor , and therefore relaxation , in my ceaseless repetition of " domo " in response to every attention they paid to my presence . Eventually , the table settled down and they took me under their wings . Several men taught me , with laughter , how sake is properly served . They communicated , through their example , the ritual politeness required to merge individual selves into a common , communal bond . The person to the left of you pours the sake into the cup of the person to his right , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the table , again and again , while everyone laughs and says " Kampai ! " " Kampai ! " The waitresses , and the kanban-musume , too , participate in the communal celebration . They are effusive with natural feelings , with genuine-sounding exclamations of joy as they serve course after course of delicacies-miso soup and tempura , white rice , fried seaweed , carefully prepared strips of beef , noodles , some of those rare fugu from the sea near Kyushu or Yamaguchi prefecture , no longer available to most people . I learned at that table the aesthetics of presentation , the art of Sara-Kobachi , the impression of infinity in the microcosmic portions of foods meticulously arranged in ceramic cups and bowls and red-lacquer dishes . This feast for the eyes , taken in together with the small portions of food , feeds the spirit with a pleasure equal with the meal itself . The art of Sara-Kobachi must represent the Japanese form of " saying grace " before a meal . <p> There is always one man in every gathering of men who is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among Osaka people , he most often seems to be a Taikomochi performer of Rakugo , the narrative commentator , weaving a tale about the foreigner , the gaijin , who came to sit at an Osaka table . He is usually the one person with the greatest emotional depths , the one who senses the most , the one who becomes the " soul " of any gathering . This figure , who was there among the men in Mr. Kusaka 's group , made cracks about me that were amusing to the others , but he was also the one who moved to sit next to me and teach me the proper hold , and best angle of movement , required for the most efficient , and best mannered , use of chopsticks . This man also taught me the etiquette of slurping sounds necessary for the deeper appreciation of miso soup . This man , whose name I have forgotten , became my mentor . At an Osaka mizushobai , after the dinner , during the less ceremonial part of the celebration , the mama-san and the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeting of the men in the group . The mama-san herself , ringing some instrument behind the bar , seemed to be an extension of the business group and its celebration . The joy in that place I remember as absolutely unmechanical . Emotions were not contagious ; they were simply there , in all of us , simply shizen na kimochi . We all , the mama-san and her two kanban-musume , toasted the young employee of Mr. Kusaka who had been promoted . Then the kanbanmusume , the two bargirls , danced with the men . I sat and talked with the young man who had been promoted , whose loyalty and hard work we were celebrating . We shared no common language , but we showed each other pictures of our families . He had a very pleasant-looking and attractive wife , and two small children . I could see in the pictures , and in the celebration around us , how comfortably his own life was fixed . I showed him my own pictures . Then one of the two kanban-musume came up to me and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is the moment in time I have been moving back towards , Kyo . Behind the bargirl I could see my mentor holding one of my shoes , and pointing at me , and then pointing to his own crotch . He had ordered that kanban-musume , that bargirl , to invite me to dance , and he was inviting me , through his comic signals , to accept . But the moment itself was unnatural . It was a constructed moment , assigned by the financial weight of the company in that bar , and the barmaid was captive to it . Moreover , the jokester , my mentor , had imposed an even greater , and much more perverse , pressure on that moment of simple giri . He held one of my shoes , and pointed at his crotch , and then at me , and then at the bargirl . This was back during that time , Kyo , when the world had just rediscovered the Japanese . This was also the time of great Japanese self-awareness , if not self-congratulation and self-inflation . Economic comparisons-imports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So were the sizes of penises . In the West , with its usual rationalized racism , there were correlations being made between brain power and penis size . The Japanese were said to be massive at one extreme , but " short " at the other . Westerners , and especially the black men of the West , were said to be " small " in areas of brainpower but " massive " in the other area . And in Japanese tradition , the size of the feet is said to be the best measurement of the man . I have long , narrow feet , and therefore long narrow shoes . The invitation to dance , then , if accepted in such a context , would have made the offer of giri artificial for the bargirl . She was merely following orders . But for me , the circumstances out of which the expression of giri flowed , would have made my acceptance of it perverse and unnatural . <p> This is why I refused , politely , to dance with the bargirl . <p> My refusal was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kio Ono said as much to the bargirl , and to the Taikomochi . The bargirl went away . We drank more sake and beer , and said " Kampai ! Kampai ! " until all of us were very drunk . Late in the evening , while we stumbled back and forth between the bathroom and our tables , some of the men took turns singing along with the karoake . Ono , and my mentor , the jokester , kept urging me to sing . I was already very drunk by then , and wanted to reclaim active participation in the community of the evening . I agreed to sing . But I wanted to sing my own song , a slow song , on my own , and not one like " Home on the Range " that was assisted by the karoake machine . So I stood next to the machine and sang from my own memory a song I had once , in high school , wanted very badly to sing to a girl I admired . I sang : <p> I can only give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold when leaves begin to fall , <p> And the only heart I own 's for you and you alone <p> That 's all , that 's all . . . <p> I sang all the verses to this song , words that had been stored up in my memory with deep connections to my true emotions , with sincerity and with feeling , I think . My voice was helped along by the clarifying power of the karoake microphone and by my sadness over the great distance I had traveled away from the sources of this song . While I sang , I watched Mr. Kusaka , and Kio Ono , and my mentor , the jokester , looking at me and learning the words of , and the real feelings behind , a song that was not recorded in the mechanical index of the karoake machine . I sang with all my heart about my heart , about the girl in high school I never had the courage to approach , about subsequent losses , about my returning capacity to still offer the same emotional bond to someone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make my own contribution to the celebration of Mr. Kusaka 's business association . <p> At the end of my song , the same bargirl came out from behind the bar , where she had been standing with the mama-san , and approached me , and said , " Mr. Jim . Will you dance with me ? " <p> We danced naturally , Kyo . We danced slowly to a slow song on the karoake machine . This young bargirl in that Osaka mizushobai was the softest woman I have ever touched . She seemed to no longer be serving the will of the group , or any obligation of giri toward my mentor or toward me . She was dancing with me because she wanted to dance with me . She danced naturally , on the memories of the new words of an old song that still had authenticity . Afterwards , Kio Ono , Mr. Kusaka , my mentor , the Taikomochi , and even the mama-san and the bargirl , whom I would never see again after that evening , all applauded with natural politeness . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life in Tokyo , Kyo . I like its tekito , its basho gara , its concentration of purpose , its bustle and its fame . But I love Osaka , and its country people , because they seem to be much more natural . <p> Go Ni Itte Wa Go Ni Shitagae ( Obey the Custom of the Village You Enter ) <p> Nepher came here recently . She had spent the past year in New York , and wanted to linger for the two last weeks of her stay in Iowa . As always , she is full of practical wisdom . She has developed a vernacular perspective on things , a practical point of view that keeps me on my toes . Who else but Nepher would contrast the qualities of the toilet papers in the United States and in Japan ? In Barbados , once , she spent some of her vacation time inspecting the shelves and freezer cases of the supermarkets , paying especial attention to the prices and the variety and the quality of the goods . She said that such items could teach her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could read in books . Nepher has taught me a lot . She observed once that the first American men who became experts on Japanese mores , before and especially after World War II , were American homosexuals . She said they lingered in Japan , after the war , because of the absence of the puritanical restrictions they had encountered in their own country . Nepher also told me that native Japanese can always discern an outsider in their country , even a Japanese outsider , because his language and manners , though adequate , no longer conform exactly to the ritual basis of feelings practiced , on a daily basis , by native Japanese . She also told me that the foreign men who speak a certain kind of Japanese , even though with extraordinary skills and nuance , still betray ( through their choice of certain words ) the fact that they learned their language from Japanese women . It is this same array of feelings , whether expressed by males or females , which permeates every nuance of Japanese life . It keeps the insiders in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about what I do not know and has shown me a shadow , a kage of all I will never know . The social sensitivity required to discern just which feelings and nuances of language and movements are equated with which ritual occasions , or with which person , or with which mood , is either innate to native Japanese , or else it is socially conditioned from the time of birth . To master it , an outsider must possess , or must develop , a nuanced heart , or must refine an already extraordinarily sensitive soul . It is too late for me , now , to develop any one of these personal resources , and so I have learned to listen to Nepher and her wisdom . <p> Nepher arrived here at just about the time Mr. Yoshimeki and his family were settling in . <p> You will remember that I first met you at a dinner with Yoshimeki-san at Hideyo Sengoku 's home in Tokyo . Tom Rohlich was there , and he and I , after Yoshimeki left , spent the night . Since that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card from him always arrives here on Christmas morning . Kio Ono has kept me aware of his progress . Yoshimeki married several years ago , and now has a son . Both his wife and Tomi , his son , and his wife 's mother , came here with him from Tokyo . They all agreed to come to this house for dinner . Nepher thought it would be best to arrange the dinner for the evening before she was to leave to return to Tokyo . She agreed to cook noodles and delicacies they might like . She came here , from her hotel room , to do her part of the cooking while I went to pick up Yoshimeki and his family from their apartment . But at the apartment , when I greeted them , they seemed very nervous . They seemed to grow increasingly nervous while I drove them to this house . All kinds of self-incriminations , the usual suspects , then began to appear in the usual public lineup in my mind . Two additional dinner guests , both male , one black and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a giri meeting of seven total strangers inside this house . And I had become responsible for the harmonious flow of the evening . <p> But , luckily , Nepher was already here preparing her noodles and sweetmeats , and when Mr. Yoshimeki and his family came through the door , she bowed very low and said " Do iteshimashite . . . " She kept saying this , bowing very low , while she backed away from the front door and through the study and into the living room . There occurred then a mysterious and magical period of profound relaxation . Faces melted away from formal smiles into attitudes of comfortable , natural repose . Laughter began to flow . Nepher spoke both Japanese and English . Yoshimeki spoke both Japanese and English . His wife and mother-in-law spoke only Japanese . Tomi ( probably Toyotomi , for Hideyoshi ) , their son , could barely speak . When the two men arrived , the other guests , while I was out in the kitchen , I thought about what Nepher had done to give the transition emotional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Do iteshimashite . . . , " as she bowed low and backed away from the front door and through the study and into the living room . My memory went back to Tokyo , from which I had a recollection stored about this same movement and bowing and language . As I stirred my pots , I remembered visiting Hamamoto-sensei 's home in Kichijoji , in the suburbs of Tokyo . His wife had given me the very same greeting . Moreover , when I was leaving their home , when Hamamoto-sensei and I were getting into his car , she had followed us out of the house and to the car . She kept bowing and saying " Do itashimashite . . . Do itashimashite . . . " ( " It 's a pleasure " ) while we were driving off in the car . I remembered looking back and seeing her still bowing when we were far down the block . It had been an expression of respect , but it also bespoke affection . I recalled then , the lesson I had learned from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors of your older buildings that abolishes the distinction between outside and inside . It is a neutral space , a blank space , much like your yohaku . The concrete material of the veranda protruding out on space says , architecturally , that the inside is not finished . Something more is owed to the space outside the privacy of the self . The engawa , I think , signifies a spiritual connection . In terms of nature , it means that the greeting of the guest walking into private space is something far beyond an expression of giri . Likewise , a special statement to a friendly guest , and bows before a departing car , are an affirmation that the natural flow of feelings does not end where the private space , the doorway , ends . All is training , everything is training , as you kept telling me , Kyo . I rediscovered in that moment , while stirring my pot , that Hamamoto-sensei and his wife had shizen na kimochi , natural affection for me . <p> Nepher confirmed this for me later when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see how nervous they were at first ? They were nervous because this is their first invitation to dinner in this country . Did n't you see how low I bowed ? " I learned from this insight the emotional correlation between the significance of the occasion and the depths of the bow . <p> There is one word that my friends there kept repeating to me . That word is shizen na kimochi , " natural . " <p> Chiri Mo Tsumoreba Yama To Naru ( Even Dust Amassed Will Grow into Mountain ) <p> Kyo , this is what I have learned : <p> In this culture we have grown used to living with " unnaturalness . " We do not bow . We do not gradate emotions . Our natural poise is the pokerface , employed to masquerade emotions contrary to each ritual occasion . Behind each poker face , at any quasi-ceremonial freeze-frame , might reside a killer , or an angel , or an abysmally lonely , or volcanically empty , human being . We , here , do not dare to risk caring in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other side of another person 's mask . And since these self-protective masks remain in place from occasion to occasion , we have come to assume , when the poker face of the " other " becomes animate , that the " other , " like us , is only acting . If the " act " remains consistent for too long , we begin to suspect the actor of being much more skilled in the aesthetics of flimflam , or of confidencing , than we are , and we begin to treat that person with great suspicion , if not watchful contempt . We study him closely , looking for fault lines and flaws in the mask . If we find any , as we must because everyone is human ( " onaji ningen nano dakar " ) , we do our best to destroy , to erase , the entire act , which has fooled us for much too long , in order to feel better about our own fragmented , suffering souls . The Japanese mask , on the other hand , is , sumairu , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is that the sumairu is assumed by all Japanese to be the " natural " composure , or mode of comportment , for a person raised in a polite society . Your own proverb , " He o hitte shiri tsubome " ( " There is no use scrunching up your buttocks after a fart " ) , speaks to this fixation on the " natural . " While here , the smile is the symbolic advertisement of a " mark , " the Fool , a soul still swimming in naivete who is in need of strict instruction in the brutal nature of reality . This is also why , perhaps , the American soul , beneath the deadpan mask , is essentially comic , while the Japanese soul , beneath the comic mask , the sumairu , is essentially tragic . Americans laugh because we do not know how to cry , and we live with the deepest fear of the tragic ; while the Japanese laugh and cry because they know that both laughter and crying are natural to human life . I will add two additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Human ) <p> The masquerade of which I speak has generated a disease that is spreading very quickly now like a virus or like a plague . Its point of contact is by way of one poisoned soul inflicting its venom , under the guise of the law of harmonious flow , on the unsuspecting and open soul of another . Here is how it works : A man sits in a restaurant which prides itself on a family atmosphere and on intimacy of service . He orders a menu , compliments the waitress when she brings it , and engages her in friendly small talk . He finally orders a hamburger , medium-rare , with a special bun , with mayonnaise , lettuce , a dash of spices-in other words , " the works . " The waitress brings it , and again she is complimented by the man , causing her to smile . He keeps up a flow of conversation with her while he eats the burger , as she rushes past his table and then back into the kitchen . He does not miss a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so good , he tells her , that he wants to order a second one , this one to go , with the very same specifications . It is to be brought to his table just after he has finished this meal . As ordered , the waitress brings the new burger , wrapped to go . Again the man compliments her on her care of him and on the superb quality of the burger . He lays blessings on both the waitress and the family restaurant . Then he goes to the counter to pay his bill . There he says , in a loud and angry voice , loud enough for the waitress cleaning off his table to hear : " This hamburger is cold . I ordered it hot . I 'm not going to pay for it ! " The spirit of the waitress is wounded , because she has allowed herself to be open to the man . <p> The same man goes into a department store in another city . He walks from store to store , inspecting shirts and shoes and jackets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced in price . He tries it on . He engages the clerk in detailed conversation about its quality , its fit on him , its reduced price . He takes a very long time getting the busy clerk to admit to liking the suit , and the way it fits , as much as the man himself . He finally decides to purchase the suit , but only if a tailoring adjustment can be made immediately on the premises , within the half-hour . The busy clerk says this can be done . The man goes out and inspects the goods in other stores . When he returns , within the hour , the suit is ready and encased expertly in a plastic bag . The man inspects the suit again , compliments the clerk on his promptness . But then he says , with the same sudden change of mood as before , " I 've changed my mind . I do n't like this suit after all . Take it back ! " <p> Something evil has occurred during these two exchanges . The expectations of two naive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most simple of things , and have then been crushed . The man seems respectable . From all outward appearances , he seems to be a model citizen . But there is a meanness in him , a smallness of soul , or perhaps it is a terror of soul , that causes him to make a lifestyle , an art , of scoping out small particles of substance from the souls , the spirits , of others . This is only one man . But his compatriots are legion . This is the new form of human being that is emerging here . Your word eta- " out-of-human " - may come close to defining people here who have lost the capacity to be human . <p> Hamamoto-sensei <p> He spent well over one week with me , here in this house , many years ago . We ate together , had many long conversations until late into the evenings , and began to share , as you and I did , the intimate details of our personal lives . One evening , at this same table on which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his youth , his boyhood , in the small , very poor village in which he was born . His father was the village doctor . It was a village dependent on the ebb and flow of fishing for its economy . But his father 's own fortunes ebbed and flowed with the willingness of the sea , its temperament , in giving up fish to the village people . I had seen , long before our talk at this table , the gates along the seashore , especially in the Osaka and Kobe areas , the shrines under which fishermen still pray to the gods of the sea , before setting out in their boats . But it was Hamamoto-sensei 's own recollection of his childhood in one of those fishing villages that brought alive for me the absolute interconnectedness , the superindividuality , of traditional Japanese village life . When there were no fish , the fishermen in the village grew poor and melancholy . They came to his father , Hamamotosensei said , with many physical complaints . But his father , the village doctor , was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own family . But he listened to the complaints of the village fishermen and advised them . He would write prescriptions for their complaints . His wife , Hamamoto-sensei 's mother , was in charge of the pharmacy .

But the doctor would write out the prescriptions anyway , and while each villager waited for it to be filled , the doctor would excuse himself and go back to the pharmacy , where his wife waited , and would whisper to her , " Give him rice ! " <p> Hamamoto-sensei cried when he recollected this . As you know much better than me , he is a stately , reserved and vigorous man with abundant gravitas .

Your own proverb " Bushi wa kuwanedo taka-yoji " ( " Even when a samurai has not eaten , he holds his toothpick high " ) comes closest to describing his demeanor . But at this table he told that story . He said , " My father told my mother , Give him rice !
