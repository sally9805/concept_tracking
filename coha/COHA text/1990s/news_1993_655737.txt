<p> MAY 26 , 1990 : " That 's when my honeymoon came to a screeching halt , " says Julius Becton . <p> Just five months earlier the retired Army general had become president of Prairie View A &M; University , one of 104 historically black colleges and universities ( HBCUs ) in the United States . <p> " We were spending upwards of $ 3 million over a four- or five-year period from our dormitory account , from our dining account , to prop up football , " General Becton recalls . " No sport was carrying its weight . " <p> So the new president canceled all sports except track and cross country , outraging students and alumni . But Becton 's message was clear : Education is Prairie View 's first priority . <p> Schools like Prairie View offer an opportunity for higher education to many African-Americans . One in six of the 1.2 million black students who went to college in the US in 1990 attended a predominately black institution . ( There are 117 such schools , 104 HBCUs and another 13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a much higher ratio - one in four - of degrees awarded to African-Americans . Among all US institutions , Prairie View 's rank in graduating blacks is third in engineering and computer science , fourth in engineering science and math , and fifth in life sciences . <p> " We pride ourselves on being able to produce productive students able to turn into productive leaders , " Becton says of HBCUs . " We take that role seriously . " <p> Prairie View graduates include Kansas City Mayor Emanuel Cleaver , Texas Congressman Craig Washington , and Lt. Gen. Calvin Waller , who was Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf 's deputy commander in the Persian Gulf . Becton , who once directed the Federal Emergency Management Agency , is also an alumnus . <p> Located 45 miles northwest of Houston , Prairie View was established in the state constitution of 1876 as the " Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas for Colored Youth , " making it the state 's second-oldest institution for higher education . <p> Today , anyone with a high school diploma or equivalent can enroll , regardless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's 6,000 students are African-American . <p> Nine out of 10 students receive some financial aid at Prairie View , where tuition , room , and board cost about $ 5,000 a year . A third of the students on aid come from families that earn less than $ 8,000 a year . <p> " The HBCUs have been for a very long time affording an opportunity for youngsters to get an education that they would not ordinarily get , " Becton says . <p> That 's why Becton denounces plans afoot in Mississippi and Louisiana . Last June the United States Supreme Court ruled against Mississippi in a 17-year-old lawsuit charging the state with underfunding historically black schools . Mississippi officials announced that it would close two HBCUs and merge their operations into the mainstream higher-education system . Louisiana intends to follow suit . <p> That was not the outcome black educators had hoped for . Though born of segregation , state-run HBCUs are valued by African-Americans as racism-free oases nurturing self-esteem and advancement . <p> Becton says that the continuing legacy of racism would make many blacks reluctant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close the Mississippi HBCUs - and it 's not a done deal yet - would those youngsters go elsewhere ? The answer is no , " he insists . Mississippi 's plans are being reviewed by a federal judge and the federal Civil Rights Commission . <p> State-run HBCUs attract more than the poor and academically underprepared . " I 've got more opportunity here , " says student-body president Tiwana Flagg , who graduated from a private , predominately white high school in Jacksonville , Fla . <p> Becton makes it clear that Prairie View is not a diploma mill for African-Americans . " We have some youngsters here who really just want to party . They spend their time doing that . They 're not going to pass . It 's as simple as that , " he says . <p> Becton 's own grandson found that out . After two consecutive semesters of below-average grades , the school required him to sit out a semester . " He 's back in school now , " Becton says . " I hope he 's doing a better job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ athletics recover . He restored all sports after three months except football , and that after a year . But the school still has no money for athletic scholarships . <p> Prairie View graduates 45 to 65 percent of its athletes . " We 'll put that record up against any school , not just in the state but in the country , " Becton says , noting that as few as 8 to 10 percent of athletes graduate at some schools . proportion of African-Americans of any major city in the United States . Nearly 80 percent of its residents are black . The same black mayor , Coleman Young , has run the city for the past 20 years . His tenure has been a constant struggle to rescue Detroit from the economic decline caused by shrinkage in the US automobile industry . <p> Twenty-five years after riots scattered many white residents to the suburbs , the city is typically described as a shriveled core surrounded by relative prosperity . Crime in Detroit is endemic ; gun-toting youngsters regularly kill each other . <p> According to some of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inexorably collapsing in on itself . They have a determined optimism about the city that defies the statistics about population loss and unemployment , as well as the boarded-up store fronts , weed-filled lots , and other daily reminders of decay . <p> The Rev. Wendell Anthony , a United Church of Christ minister who was recently elected president of the Detroit branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) , says " Detroit has not seen its best days . " The " media image " of the city , Mr. Anthony says , does not account for the substantial talents and abilities of its citizens . <p> Anthony 's point is bolstered by Melvin J. Hollowell Jr. , a lawyer in his mid-30s who puts in 12 hours or more of pro bono ( unpaid ) work for the NAACP each week . Mr. Hollowell 's firm - Lewis , White &; Clay - is the largest black-owned law firm in the country , he says , with 35 lawyers at its Detroit headquarters and in Washington . <p> While his professional specialty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly civil rights . He is currently shepherding a discrimination lawsuit against the car-insurance industry through the state courts . " I believe people should be charged based on how they drive , not where they live , " he says . <p> The case plunges into what Mr. Hollowell calls " the new civil rights arena . " Such cases " will make us get into the guts of how things work , " says the attorney . He sees banking practices , which put hurdles before black homeowners or businesspeople who want loans , as another part of this " arena . " <p> Hollowell has an eye on the political arena , too . He is " in the hunt " to become US attorney in Detroit . Unlike many other young black professionals - " Buppies " - Hollowell and his wife live in the city , where he grew up . Their five-year-old son attends a private school in the city called Nataki Talibah . Like most of the Detroit public schools , it emphasizes African culture . <p> From the one-story , gold-buff rectangle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own African-flavored youth programs - Isuthu and Intonjani , Xhosa ( African ) terms for coming into manhood and womanhood . The programs , which include some 275 youngsters aged 6 to 18 , put a premium on helping the elderly and serving the community . <p> Despite the low incomes of most Detroit residents , the city 's African-American community manages some impressive fund-raising . Each year the local NAACP - with 20,000 members , by far the largest branch in the US - holds a Freedom Fund dinner for some 10,000 guests . The event , which attracts wide corporate support , brings in more than $ 1 million for scholarships and other NAACP programs . But that should only be a start , says Anthony . " If we have a Freedom Fund dinner , we must have a grass-roots breakfast . " <p> He worries about a gap between prominent leaders in the community and the mass of people struggling to stay afloat in Detroit 's economic turbulence . To solve the city 's problems , Anthony says , " we must work in coalition with others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the prerequisite for progress , he says , is a drawing together of the city 's black population itself . <p> Institutions of government may have to change . Keith Butler , another prominent young black minister before he became the first Republican elected to Detroit 's City Council in decades , says the city has to lighten its tax burden before it can hope to retain the businesses it has , much less attract new ones . <p> Also , the crime problem has to be attacked with a larger , revitalized police force , Mr. Butler says - something that could be possible , he adds , if inefficiency were rooted out of city government . <p> Butler hopes for a changing of the guard in City Hall this year . After 20 years , he says , the Young administration " has run out of steam . " <p> Anthony defends the mayor , while noting that " within any group , you always have another generation coming up . " " I do n't like the old-guard , new-guard split , " he says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deprivation , regardless of age , gender , or ethnicity. "
