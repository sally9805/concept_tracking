<p> You staked your campaign on the pledge to cut the city 's bureaucracy , and yesterday the voters said : " Do it . " This is an unbelievable opportunity the first hopeful moment in District of Columbia politics in a decade and also a chance to show New York , Philadelphia , Detroit , and all the other rotting big city governments how to use personnel cuts to pull back from the brink of chaos and insolvency  --  to make our schools work , our families secure , and our streets safe . Let 's not blow it . Let 's get started today . <p> " Immediately upon entering office , I will conduct a thorough management audit to identify those agencies that are bloated and inefficient , " you told us during the campaign . " I intend to cut 2,000 mid-management level paper pushers from the government payrolls . " What 's worrying me now is that you never went on to say anything more than this about cuts . You recently admitted to the Monthly that the 2,000 figure was just " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definition of what I 'm talking about , " and that you would make greater cuts " before we tax everybody out of the city . " You should have said the same thing loud and clear during the campaign . Doubletalk about the size of the cuts is deadly most of all because your great strength as a leader is that you tell it like it is . <p> I 'm writing now to raise issues you have to confront starting today if the cause of government efficiency in the District is ever going to be more than just another campaign buzzword : <p> A. Making the city work will require firing a lot more than 2,000 people . Its payroll of 48,000 people  --  the costs of which take up half the city 's annual budget  --  gives the District nearly twice as many nonfederal government employees per capita as California , Florida , or Michigan . And businesses that have shrunk to boost productivity illustrate proportionally much larger cuts than the 4 percent you 've advocated . From 1981 to 1989 , GE increased its productivity more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its salaried staff by 40 percent . ( Incidentally , business comparisons are n't made often enough by those in government : One assumption that has no place in bureaucratic reform is " close enough for government work "  --  the idea that government agencies must be inherently sloppier and less focused than businesses , and hence can learn nothing from them . Even in the District 's government there are counterexamples to that trash collection and parking meter enforcement come to mind . Indeed , comparing the Teutonic precision of the District 's parking ticket writers with the Sovietized slow-motion of its ticket processors downtown should suggest that government per se is not the problem . ) <p> As you know , in any organization , there are jobs that are directly related to the manufacture of the product or the delivery of the service and those that are not . Although many of the latter are legitimate managerial , advisory , or technical jobs , once you get away from identifiable makings and doings , there 's much greater potential for jobs that do n't really count . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It 's scandalous that the city government has taken absolutely no interest in discovering its own chiefs and Indians structure . Nobody among the 371 employees in the D.C. Office of Personnel  --  an organization that does n't know it has almost twice as many chiefs as Indians . Not the Supervisory Personnel Management Specialist ( salary : $70,013 ) . Not the Human Resource Development Officer ( $64,041 ) . Nor the Supervisory Personnel Staffing Specialist ( $50,653 ) . One official in the city budget office told me , " No one has ever asked that question before . But one of the guys said that if you find anything out , they 'd sure be interested in the answer . " Curiously , this same man later told me that the problem with saying that you could save money by cutting midlevel people is that there are not enough of them . How does he know ? Apprised of the city 's utter lack of self-knowledge , a federal personnel official said , " I do n't know how they could run a city without knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you have one mid-level chief for every four Indians ; generally , an organization fares best when it attains a ratio considerably smaller than that . Quad/Graphics , the company that prints Time , Newsweek , and the L.L. Bean catalog , has a mid-level-C/I ratio of . 11 . In its most recent fiscal year , Federal Express turned a profit of $115 million on a mid-level-C/I ratio of .065 . Last year , the Fiat auto division made $1.8 billion on a mid-level-C/I of about .045 . <p> One way to see just how far the District has to go to attain real efficiency is to look at its mid-level-C/I . The city 's personnel categories are set up to approximate those of the federal government 's GS schedule , in which grades 12-15 comprise the bulk of middle management , with grades 5 , 6 , and 7 reflecting much of the troop strength . ( Although grades 1 through 4 are still on the books , they are virtually unfilled , while at the other end of the scale , grades 16 , 17 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city payroll . ) While there are some counterexamples to tracking bureaucratic function by pay grade  --  such as a grade 13 dentist at a public health clinic or a grade 12 court reporter in Superior Court , both of whom are clearly service providers  --  overall , counting Cs and Is by these categories still develops a valid snapshot of government efficiency . Using this approach , you arrive at a mid-level C/I ratio for the District of .30  --  in the D.C. government , the average mid-level chief leads a tribe of just over 3 Indians . <p> B. It 's not just political appointees who have to go . You have described your proposed cuts as " the only responsible way to avoid furloughs of the rank-and-file service providers . " Now , this can be taken to mean that other things being equal , cutting mid-level chiefs is preferable to getting rid of Indians ; on that interpretation , you should be applauded . But such pronouncements are vague enough to be taken instead as saying that we can solve all the problems just by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's false . Since there are fewer than 200 political appointees in the District government ( and half of those are entitled to retreat to civil service jobs if they are fired ) , the problem goes far beyond them . You seemed to admit as much when you told the Monthly that you will do whatever it takes to get rid of rank-and-file nonperformers . This too is something you need to declare publicly . <p> C. Make your strongest efficiency efforts in the worst departments . That 's where the results will be the most obvious and where you can help the most citizens . <p> Thirty-nine of the 45 salaries listed for the Department of Human Services ( DHS ) on the first page of the District 's fiscal publication titled " Serving the People , Meeting the Challenge " exceed $50,000 , and none of the other six is below $44,639 . But that 's what it takes to build up a C/I ratio of .49 . ( That 's just about one chief for every two Indians ! And some divisions of DHS run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .91  --  nearly one-to-one . ) On the other hand , if you happen to have a sick baby , and it 's after 4:45 p.m. on a weekday or it 's a weekend , do n't bother visiting the walk-in clinics the department runs . Due to a shortage of staff , they 'll be closed ( with the exception of one clinic that still offers evening hours ) . Earlier this year Mayor Barry told Washington 's City Paper , " I maintain that any woman in Washington who is pregnant , who wants to get an appointment , can get one in less than a month . " Serving who ? Meeting what ? <p> Granted , you do not directly control the public schools  --  that 's the school board 's role . But in elections for the board , the mayor 's endorsement is among the most sought-after , and you 'll be the one setting the overall total for the school budget . So you do have considerable influence on the board . And are n't the schools just too important not to use it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spends 51 percent more than the nationwide average for public schools , only 55 percent of its budget goes to the instruction of students . The panel of civic leaders known as the D.C. Committee on Public Education ( COPE ) discovered that the city 's public schools spend $536 less per pupil on instruction than comparable urban districts . And they get what they pay for : a 43 percent drop-out rate , a high-school grade average of D+ , and SAT scores that are about a hundred points off the national norm  --  and third from the bottom . Nearly a quarter of all the grades given in the city 's high schools are Fs . Thanks to the dearth of enriched and remedial courses and activities , in 12 years of school the District 's kids average up to two years ' less classroom time than the students in the nearby suburban schools . <p> On the other hand , the system spends 36 percent of its cash on what it calls " non-school-based support . " COPE noted that the District employs 1,250 more non-school-based staff than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group recommended eliminating 400 central staff positions . As of this date , however , no administrative personnel cuts have been made . Would a few suggestions help ? How about deep-sixing the Research and Data Management Coordinator ( salary : $45,218 ) ? Here 's the official description of that job : " Reviews and approves requests for proposals . Conducts state research projects for program improvement . Assesses non-public school needs , and maintains accurate child count . " Or the Program Monitoring and Evaluation Coordinator ( also paid $45,218 ) ? The description : " Ensures program compliance and approval through selected monitoring procedures . Provides technical assistance to programmatic efforts designed to address compliance issues identified in needs assessment . Conducts evaluation of programs , oversees and monitors programs for quality , ensures compliance to guidelines and regulations , updates and ensures compliance to state regulations WHAT STATE ? , maintains liaison to regional resource center , and maintains system inventory . " It 's hard to understand all this verbiage , but if it says that this person 's job is to maintain quality in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And since when do we need to pay somebody 45 grand to take attendance ? <p> The average public school in the District has 45 fire code violations  --  and there have been attempts to remedy only half of them . The majority of D.C. school buildings have been poorly maintained for decades . Many classrooms are unheated ; students and faculty have been injured by falling ceiling tiles , plaster , and window frames . Bathrooms with stopped-up toilets and sinks are commonplace . The showers in some locker rooms have not worked in 25 years . Some schools have only cold water ; 24 have no running water at all . There are also chronic shortages of toilet paper , paper towels , and light bulbs . Some schools , apparently not getting any help from the General Supply Specialist , the Supply Management Officer , or the Inventory Management Specialist downtown ( each drawing a salary of $35,294 ) in their attempts to get soap , make their own . <p> And it 's not just worthless administrators that somehow stick around in the schools . Despite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , a grand total of nine teachers have been terminated as a result of the evaluation system . What 's more , that 's all the public schools tried to terminate . That 's nine out of 6,600 . <p> Washington 's public housing department is sort of the reverse Royal Air Force of city agencies  --  never before have so many done so little for so many . The department 's C/I ratio is an appalling .91 . " Having three compassionate , effective people on the staff would accomplish more than the city is doing now in the area of housing , " Florence Roisman , a staff attorney at the National Housing Law Project , told me recently . Despite a departmental maintenance payroll that 's 50 percent larger than HUD recommends , fewer than 40 percent of the apartments the city targeted for renovation four years ago have been made ready for occupancy . The city 's public housing now includes 2,582 empty apartments  --  a crying shame in a city where homelessness is a major crisis . <p> At city budget hearings in February 1989 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing maintenance said that on any given day 63 percent of the people under him did not show up for work . Despite this , at the hearings this year , the department did not request new maintenance personnel . It did , however , ask for an additional $141,000 for new staff positions . <p> Recent correspondence between officials of the District 's housing department  --  including Roland Turpin , the director  --  and HUD officials indicates that within the past year the city missed out on HUD housing vouchers and certificates worth millions of dollars earmarked for hundreds of homeless families because the department did n't get the applications in on time and because essential documents were missing . No other public housing authority in the country has made that mistake . Even when the department appealed HUD 's decision , it still failed to submit complete paperwork . In other cases , the department has withdrawn requests for HUD housing vouchers for the homeless because it " determined that the paperwork and staff time involved in securing the additional funding is administratively infeasible . " <p> In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about eight years for a family to be placed in a public housing unit . <p> D. You 've got to put more cops on the street . " When I joined the police department in 1968 , " Lt. Lowell Duckett , head of the D.C. Black Police Caucus , recently told me , " police districts were called police precincts . And precincts were manned by one captain , four lieutenants , and maybe 16 sergeants . Now we have one deputy chief , four captains , and approximately 21 lieutenants per police district . But guess what ? The geographical boundaries of the district did n't change . " One quick way to effectively improve the current police C/I ratio of .22  --  about one chief for every four Indians  --  would be to put many of Washington 's 3,100 under-used federal cops on patrol in the city 's high crime areas ( there 's no good reason the feds should n't keep paying for them ) . Currently , for instance , the Secret Service 's Uniformed Division languishes in the tranquil driveways of Embassy Row , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very well-trained and well-equipped ; they could make a big difference on some of Washington 's mean streets . But instead , as presently deployed , all they do is provide extra comfort to the District 's wealthiest residents  --  which merely reinforces the indifference of the rich to crime elsewhere in the city . <p> E. Cutting personnel wo n't cut the city 's costs enough  --  you have to cut pensions too . Pension costs are rising much faster than salary costs . The pension expenses that the District is already committed to but which its investments wo n't pay for  --  its unfunded pension liability  --  now run $4.93 billion . And probably the biggest factor in the problem is that the city 's police and firefighters are able to retire after only 20 years : that 's the reason fully $3.25 billion of the city 's unfunded pension liability  --  66 percent  --  is earmarked for those two groups . The law limits what we can do about the pension payouts due to the 61 percent of the D.C. police force that is scheduled to retire in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the officers who take their place or this city is dead . <p> It sounds cold to be talking of reducing benefits , and doing so could make it harder on the individual retiree . But the city has legitimate needs too . And is it really so awful to ask people in their forties to work an extra five or ten years ? <p> F. Do n't be afraid to add people in departments  --  especially if they are good assessors , auditors , tax collectors , and lawyers in revenue-raising positions . Talk of cutting can easily degenerate into the mistaken idea that every gain in efficiency requires a reduction in personnel . Net reductions are the rule when the functions in an office are consolidated and when pointless jobs are eliminated ( see " Ready , Aim . . . Fire , " below ) . But obviously , when key functions are discovered to be undermanned or manned by incompetents , the reform could easily result in more people , not fewer . One example is in revenue-raising offices . When , on the eve of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she and her husband had gone eight years without paying local income taxes , one mystery was how Norton still managed to win . But another much more important one was : How did the city 's Department of Finance and Revenue miss the boat ? Within days of the Norton story came the news that two candidates for D.C. 's " shadow " Senate seat  --  Charles Moreland and Jesse Jackson  --  had likewise not paid some city income tax . But the news did n't come from Finance and Revenue . Could that be because the department has a C/I of .64 and one administrator for every three auditors ? How many other tax cheats has the city missed because of that ? <p> And the city seems just as lax when it comes to real estate assessments . D.C. assessments are supposed to represent a property 's full market value , so that the property owners pay their fair share of tax . Of course , there are such well-known exemptions as the White House and the National Cathedral . But there are lesser-known ones like the three-fifths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which he pays no city tax . Or the half of Oliver North attorney Brendan Sullivan 's $1.75 million residence that also skates by tax-free . That 's how far off the market the city assessments are . Some other examples : Attorney General Richard Thornburgh ( market value=$475,000/assessed value=$249,635 ) , publisher Bill Regardie ( MV=$1.5 million/ AV=$760,000 ) , Rep. Lindy Boggs ( MV=$900,000/ AV=$253,450 ) , real estate mogul Calvin Cafritz ( MV=$2.8 million/AV=$1.5 million ) , commentator Carl Rowan ( MV=$950,000/AV=$516,679 ) , and rejected judge Robert Bork ( MV=$925,000/AV= $570,000 ) . And while it 's not the most spectacular example , even your house is underassessed by nearly $100,000 ( MV=$350,000/AV= $253,475 ) . <p> Additionally , in appeals this year of real estate assessments , when the city 's attorneys went up against those representing property owners , they got their heads handed to them : the result was a loss of $36.8 million in tax revenue . <p> Clearly then , the city could use better staffing in the revenue-producing jobs . Besides the financial reason for hiring in these slots , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest obstacles to pruning back the city 's bureaucracy has been the fear that the axe would fall disproportionately on the working class . Well , setting more employees to work on recovering funds owed by the city 's rich is a very good way to share the burden of making government more efficient . <p> G. This problem ca n't be solved on paper . This is just the first wave of tons of printed advice you will start receiving immediately . Besides all the unsolicited help you 'll be getting from the press , the commission on budget and financial priorities for the city will soon release its findings ( that 's the one headed by Alice Rivlin , former head of the Congressional Budget Office , that reportedly calls for cutting 6,200 jobs ) . And there are the city-wide audits by outside firms that you intend to order up yourself . Please read all these things carefully and with great openness , but always remember one thing : No matter how insightful , no column , no report , is the solution . Making the city conform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not something you can do at arm's-length . You have to get in peoples ' faces . Government is not a science  --  it 's a contact sport . Here are some winning plays : <p> The ultimate weapon of the redundant employee is his belief that any cry for reform will blow over  --  that he can outlast this new threat just like he 's survived all the rest . So it 's crucial that you stock your administration with people who make it plenty clear they are going to be there longer than one or two years , long enough to " out-tough " the opposition . ( By contrast for example , during the eighties , DHS changed heads nine times . ) <p> Especially if you are armed with a commission report or two , there 'll be a great temptation for you to sweep into office with a lot of theories about what 's screwed up and how to fix things . Avoid that . Your theories may be right , but what have you got to lose by testing them against the evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is plenty of danger in " reforming " activities you do n't , understand . ( Like every other journalist , I have at times missed out on an important dimension of a fact because I did n't want to appear foolish for not knowing it . ) So resist any temptations in yourself and your staff to play rocket scientist and opt instead for being the Mayor from Mars . Start by finding out what the Indian level of the outfit is  --  where the ultimate function of the office is supposed to be performed ( if nobody seems to know , you 've learned something important already )  --  and by finding out what those people do all day . Ask them what their main problems are . Ask them to identify their important tasks and their unimportant ones . Ask them which supervisors are good , and which are n't so good , and why . When you think you have a handle on the troop functions , you should work yourself up the chain of command rung by rung , asking questions along the way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly as possible . The sooner you identify the problems , the sooner you can solve ( fire ) them . <p> And even after you 've done all this , you have to be sure you always know what those Indians are doing , with a constant eye towards streamlining offices and eliminating pointless job slots and bad performers . You just ca n't overstate the amount that gets lost in translation between you and the troops  --  if you let it . I know you had a big job at Pepco , but I do n't think you had to worry in the middle of the night about whether the lines were down . Now you do . <p> And finally , bureaucratic reform goes nowhere without guts . Firing people is not the world 's most pleasant task . Sub-par performers can be nice , they often have families , and most distressing of all for a politician , they have votes . ( Ditto for competent people in pointless jobs . ) The traditional alternative to the real courage it takes to shake a man 's hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a make-believe job where he does n't bother you or , better yet , transfer him to somebody else 's office . Not only is this personally corrupting , but for the government it 's the very stuff of inefficiency . <p> That 's why it worried me when you recently joked that your cuts of mid-management employees would effect " nobody I know personally . " Up until now , that joke has always been on us . <p> By Scott Shuger <p> <p> Scott Shuger , is an editor of The Washington Monthly . Research assistance was provided by Andrea , Bates and Patrick O'Rourke . <p> READY , AIM ... FIRE <p> Once you 've decided which city employees are unnecessary , then comes the hard part . Firing them . It 's not as easy to pry people out of government jobs as it should be , but there are some helpful tricks : <p> Turkey farming . Inside the District government , this is also known as Pass-the-Trash . The usual version of turkey fanning is only a local solution , doing nothing for overall efficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so it passes him off to Office B , issuing its glowing recommendation with an internal wink and a grin . But turkey fanning can be a useful tool . If you have an employee doing nothing and you 'd like to empty out his desk , the trick is to find out what , if anything , he does well . The grumpiest front-office counselor in D.C. 's Department of Employment Services might just be brilliant at some job in back where he does n't have to deal with the public . <p> Old-fashioned firing . Of course , if that employee 's just plain incompetent , you can get rid of him , even with all those intimidating civil service rules . " People always blame the regulations for keeping a deadbeat around , " says one veteran D.C. administrator , " but you can get rid of someone if you 're willing to take the heat and do the work . " Since documenting a case for termination may take months , many managers decide that they do n't have the patience for the inevitable accusations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the discretionary power to fire with impunity the city 's nearly 200 political appointees and 3,800-odd probationary civil servants and temporary workers . And even after the employee is entrenched , the regs only require giving 30 days notice  --  during which a manager must make an effort to help the staff member solve workplace problems and order an independent review of the case by a " disinterested designee . " <p> The catch is that the District 's iron-clad personnel " penalty guide " severely circumscribes what , precisely , a manager can fire someone for . Right now , the worst punishment an employee can receive for supplying false information to superiors or the City Council or Congress is a five-day suspension . Same with being drunk or stoned on company time , gambling on the job , or even committing a criminal act off-hours that " discredits the D.C. government . " But the mayor can propose revisions to this and all the city 's other civil service regulations , and lobby the City Council to pass them . Congress , which technically must approve any such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you had a single clerk whose job consisted of doing absolutely nothing , your best move would be to simply abolish the job . If you had an office that was doing nothing , you 'd dissolve it . Problem is , the jobs and offices that could be slashed without any penalty at all exist only in parodies or business school textbooks . Most people in city government do something important  --  but they may spend only a fraction of the day doing it . The new administration 's task will be to identify the meaningful tasks a worker performs ; suspend the pointless duties , memos , and meetings ; and splice the worthwhile functions together into fewer job slots . <p> While reduction in force ( RIF ) procedures , which reduce the work force by a given percentage or a set number , allow the cleanest cuts , they have one substantial built-in flaw : They operate by seniority , which means the office 's freshest blood is the first to be let . The worker you wind up with may be just the oldest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrowed a tip from the feds : To give managers more flexibility in keeping the bright young things , it has revised its civil service manual . Nowadays , an employee who receives an outstanding evaluation gets four years of seniority points along with his performance bonus . Outstanding ratings can , of course , be handed out to cronies as well as to great employees . So the new mayor and her team have to keep an eye on who 's getting them and why . <p> Even a whole office that seems fairly pointless  --  D.C. 's Office of Inaugural Expenses , say  --  usually performs at least one essential function , like making sure that public money is n't squandered on private extravaganzas . An aggressive manager will abolish the agency and salvage that legitimate function by assigning it to a better-defined unit , cutting out half a dozen managers in the process . ( He should also try to place good workers from the folded unit in other , more productive operations . ) <p> Incidentally , in the District you can do this without a RIF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must not be one specifically created by City Council mandate  --  the trade-school monitoring office of the Educational Licensure Commission , for example , would require a Council vote to be abolished . And second , you must transfer the " separated " staff instead of firing or demoting them . ( Again , Mayor Dixon should convince the Council to eliminate or at least loosen these restrictions . ) <p> Contracting out . Another way to close an ineffective office with a valuable function is to contract that function out . Take the library at the U.S. Census Bureau : Administrators there thought the library was a million-dollar drain on their budget and the librarians a drain on their patience . So they simply contracted the whole thing out and transferred or fired the unpopular staff . The library still sits in the building , but the cost is hundreds of thousand of dollars less , and the administrators ' grave problem  --  impolite librarians  --  was solved . To be sure , this is a technique to be used with caution  --  pocket-padding contractors can be more expensive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contracting is that the courts have consistently upheld the manager 's right to use it to cut staff . <p> By Katherine Boo <p>
