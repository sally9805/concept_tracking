You can measure a baseball fan by his boyhood heroes . On the wall behind Fay Vincent 's desk is the original artwork from Whitey Ford 's 1953 Topps baseball card , a talisman of the bygone era when the New York Yankees symbolized success , stability and smug superiority . If Joe DiMaggio personified grace , and Mickey Mantle represented God-given talent , then Ford , the gritty little lefty ace of the pitching staff , was guile elevated to Hall of Fame standards . This quality is not lost on the baseball commissioner , who says with reverence , " He had the greatest pick-off move to first . " <P> The image is worth savoring . A pick-off can be a thing of beauty : the pitcher leans in toward home plate , spies the base runner overreaching himself , then suddenly wheels and fires to first to nab him by half a step . Artful misdirection plus exact timing equals a dramatic out ; Vincent understands that baseball equation . For never in the game 's history has there been a pick-off move as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week when he threw George Steinbrenner out as the principal owner of the Yankees . <P> July 30 , V-S Day ( Victory over Steinbrenner ) , may become a patriotic holiday in New York City and wherever the proud traditions of baseball are honored . That evening , the commissioner announced the glorious news : " Mr. Steinbrenner will have no further involvement in the management of the New York Yankees . " At Yankee Stadium , where the last-place club that Steinbrenner has assembled ( a Mercenaries Row of no-talent free agents , high-priced castoffs and rookies ) was playing the Detroit Tigers , the crowd rose in a standing ovation when the news spread that the familiar chant " the Boss must go " would actually become reality . <P> For most fans the formal rationale for the commissioner 's decision was as irrelevant as the details of the government 's tax case against Al Capone . What mattered was that Steinbrenner 's 17-season reign of terror was finally over , and the Yankees were liberated from the egomaniacal whirl of managerial musical chairs , maladroit trades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alike . <P> The commissioner , of course , must play within the white lines , balancing his freedom to act in the " best interests " of baseball with constraints on his power to deprive an owner of his property rights over a $200 million franchise like the Yankees . Steinbrenner 's transgression was giving $40,000 to admitted gambler Howie Spira . The money was almost certainly payment for Spira to delve for dirt on Dave Winfield ( now with the California Angels ) , whom the Boss publicly plotted against from the moment he signed the star rightfielder to a 10-year contract in 1980 . If this sounds confusing , take comfort that the commissioner saw in Steinbrenner " a pattern of behavior that borders on the bizarre . " But the Yankee owner 's payoff to a gambler , with its echoes of Pete Rose 's bookie season , gave Vincent the disciplinary leverage he needed .
