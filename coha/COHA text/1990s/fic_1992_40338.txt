It always seemed to be snowing in Zurich that winter , but as Peter walked toward the cafe , he found himself looking up at an astonishingly blue sky . <p> Cold , still colder than a well-digger 's ass , but clear nonetheless . He was so taken aback he stopped . There was a dull sun , looking as frozen as an outdoor Christmas tree ornament , over to the west . The houses and buildings all seemed new-washed ; even the slush on the sides of the street was white , not the usual sooty gray . Perhaps the crowd for the opening night might be larger than even he had hoped . If Brecht were still alive , he would have said , " Weather good for a crowd , good for a crowd . " <p> There was a stuttering hum in the air , a summer sound from another country and time , the sound of a fan in a faraway room . It got louder . Then above the lake the airship Herman Goring II pulled into view like an art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ border to Berne . Some mighty Germans aboard ; an admiral 's and two generals ' pennants flew from the tail landing ropes just below the swastikas on the stubby fins . Peter 's eyes were getting worse ( he was in his fifties ) but he noticed the flags while the thing was still two kilometers away . The airship passed out of sight beyond the nearest buildings . Its usual course was far northwest of Zurich  --  one of the Aryans must have wanted a look . <p> Higher up in the sky he saw the thin slash of white made by the Helsinki-Madrid jet , usually invisible far above the snowy clouds over Switzerland . Peter had n't seen it for months ( not that he 'd even been looking ) . To people here , the passenger planes were something you only occasionally saw , like summer . Well , maybe that will change tonight , he thought . They 'll never look at a jet plane or a rocket the same way again . <p> Then he asked himself : Who are we fooling ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The actor doubling in the role of the blind organ grinder was having trouble with his Zucco , so in the last run-through he had to sing a cappella . Another headache , thought Peter . Brecht 's widow sent the offending instrument out : The one thing you could get done in Switzerland was have things fixed . More trouble : The ropes holding some of the props had loosened ; they had to be restrung . <p> Peter tugged on a carabinier . " Zero , " he said to the actor , " you really should lose some weight . " Peter had the voice of a small , adenoidal Austrian garter snake . <p> The other actor ( in the Cabaret Kropotkin , everyone was an actor , everyone a stagehand , an usher , waiter , a dishwasher ) pulled himself to his full height . He towered over Peter and blocked his view of the stage . He let go of his end of the rope . <p> " What ? And lose my personality ? " said Zero . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Peter . " On what we make , I do n't know how you gain weight . " He pulled on the guy rope . <p> " Do what ? Gain ? Back in America . I used to weigh  --  " <p> " Back in America , " said Shemp , the other actor with a leading role in the play , " back in America , we all had jobs . We also knew how to keep a rope tight . " He jerked it away , burning their hands . <p> " Quit trying to be your late brother ! " said Zero , sucking on his fingers . " You just do n't have Moe 's unique personality . " <p> " And he did n't have my looks . Eeep Eeep Eeep Eeep ! " <p> Peter shook his head , twisted a turnbuckle past the stripped place on the threads . <p> " Vaudeville ! " said Zero . " God , how I do n't miss it ! " <p> " Eight shows a day ! " said Shemp . " Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing your name is going to be up in is the pay register , " said Brecht 's widow from the cabaret floor where she had returned without a sound , " if you do n't get those ropes straightened out . " <p> " Yes , comrade Ma'am , " said Shemp for all of them . <p> A little after 5 p.m. they finished the last rehearsal and it was time for supper . They 'd had to cook that , too . A healthy cabbage soup with potatoes and a thick black bread Zero had kneaded up that morning . <p> Madame Brecht , who wore her hair in a severe bun , joined them . The conversation was light . The Poles , Swedes , English , American , German , French and Lithuanians who made up the ensemble had been together for such a time they no longer needed to talk . One look , and everybody knew just how everybody else 's life was going . When they did speak ; it was in a sort of pig-Esperanto comprised of parts of all their languages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doses of Hegelian gibberish . <p> Not that a single one of them did n't believe that being right there right then was n't the only place to be . <p> Bruno , the old German gaffer , was staring into his soup bowl like it was the floor of Pontius Pilate 's house . <p> Shemp whispered to Peter , " Here comes the fucking Paris story again . " <p> " I was there , " said Bruno . " I was in the German Army then . What did I know ? I was fifty-three years old and had been drafted . " <p> Madame Brecht started to say something . Peter caught her eye and raised his finger , warning her off . <p> " Paris ! " said the old man , looking up from the table . " Paris , the second time we took it . There we were in our millions , drums beating , bugles blaring , rank on rank of us ! There was the Fuhrer in his chariot , Mussolini following behind in his . There they were pulling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lead traces , de Gaulle and Bomber Harris behind . Poor Bomber ! He 'd been put in at the last moment after they shot Patton down like a dog when he refused . Then came all the Allied generals with their insignia ripped off . It was a beautiful spring day . It was fifteen years ago . " <p> There were tears streaming down his face , and he looked at the Madame and smiled in a goofy way . <p> " I remember it well , " continued Bruno , " for that night , while looting a store , under the floorboards , I found the writings of Mr. Brecht . " <p> " Thank you for your kind reminiscence , Bruno , " said the Madame . <p> " Suck up ! " said Zero , under his breath . <p> " Just another hard-luck story , " said Shemp . <p> " I like it very much , " said Peter to Zero quietly . " It has a certain decadent bourgeois charm . " <p> " Does anyone else have an anecdote about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectantly . <p> Peter sighed as someone else started in on yet another instructive little dialectic parable . <p> Arguing with Brecht had been like talking to a Communist post . When the man 's mind was made up , that was that . When it was n't was the only time you could show him he was being a Stalinist putz ; only then had he been known to rewrite something . <p> The first time Peter had met Brecht , Peter had been nineteen and fresh off the last turnip truck from Ludow . All he wanted was a Berlin theater job ; what Brecht wanted was a talented marionette . He 'd ended up doing Brecht 's comedy by night and Fritz Lang 's movies by day , and in his copious free time learning to spend the increasingly inflated Weimar money , which eventually became too cheap to wipe your butt with . Then Peter found himself in America , via Hitchcock , and Brecht found himself in Switzerland , via Hitler . <p> Peter sighed , looking around the table . Everybody here had a story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was making movies and money in America . I was nominated for the Academy Award twice , after playing Orientals and psychopaths and crazy weenies for ten years . There was a war on : I was safe . It was that fat old fart Greenstreet , God rest his soul , who talked me into the USO tour with him . There we were , waiting for Glenn Miller 's plane to come in , near the Swiss border , six shows a day , Hitler almost done in , the biggest audiences we 'd ever played to when BLAM !  --  the old world was gone . <p> And when I quit running , it 's " hello , Herr Brecht , it is I , your long-lost admirer , Peter , the doormat . " <p> " And you ? " asked Madame . " What can you tell us of our late departed genius ? " <p> Peter ran through thirty years of memories , those of the first , and the ones of the last fifteen years . Yes , age had mellowed the parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had begun to bathe and change clothes more often after his second or third heart attack , which had made things much more pleasant . He had exploited people a little less ; possibly he 'd forgotten how , or was so used to it that he no longer noticed when he was n't . No , the mental fires had never gone out . Yes , it was hard to carry on their work without the sharp nail of his mind at the center of their theater . He could also have said that Brecht spent the last three years of his life trying to put The Communist Manifesto into rhymed couplets . He could have said all that . Instead , he looked at the Madame . " Brecht wanted to live his life so that every day at 6 p.m. he could go into his room , lock the door , read cheap American detective stories , and eat cheese to his heart 's content . The man must have had bowel muscles like steel strands . " <p> Then Peter got up and left the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reichsconsul in Zurich and was only twenty-five years old . Which meant , of course , that he was a major in the Geheime Staats Polizei . His job at the Consulate included arranging and attending social and cultural affairs , arrangements for touring groups from the Fatherland to various Swiss cities ( Zurich , he thought , rather than Berne , being the only city in the country with any culture at all ) . His other job was easier  --  he could have been assigned to one of the Occupied Lands , or South America , or as liaison with the Japanese  --  which every day was becoming more and more of a chore for the Reich ; his friend back in Berlin in the Ministry of Manufacture told him the members of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere had come up with many technical innovations in the last few years ; they were now making an automobile as good as the Volkswagen and had radio and televiewing equipment that required only three tubes . <p> That second job of his consisted of forwarding to Berlin , each year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of these , a dozen , or fifteen would be picked . These people would suddenly find that their permanent resident alien status in Switzerland was in question , there were certain charges , etc . And then they would be asked by the Swiss to leave the country . <p> Everyone was satisfied with the arrangement , the Swiss , the Reich , in some strange way the resident aliens , as long as they were n't one of the dozen or so . Switzerland itself was mined and booby-trapped and well-defended . If the Reich tried to invade , the Alps would drop on them . Germany controlled everything going in and out  --  it surrounded the country for two thousand kilometers in every direction  --  the New Lands , New Russland , New Afrika , New Iceland , the lands along the shiny new Berlin-Baghdad eisenbahn  --  except the contents of the diplomatic pouches , and some of those , too . <p> If the Fatherland tried to use the Weapons on the Swiss , they lost all those glittery numbered assets , and endangered their surrounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , as the First Fuhrer had said , we have a thousand years ; at a dozen a year we will eventually get them all . <p> Edward , his assistant , knocked and came in . <p> " Heil Bormann , " he said , nonchalantly raising his hand a few inches . <p> " OK , " said Brettschneider , doing likewise . <p> " You remember that the two younger cousins of the Swabian Minister for Culture are arriving Thursday ? " asked Edward . <p> " I had tried to forget , " said Brettschneider . He opened the big 1960 calendar on his desk to February 13th , made a note . " Will you please make sure the schedule in the hall is marked ? Why , why do people come to Switzerland in the winter ? " <p> " I certainly have no idea , " said Edward . " What 's doing ? " <p> " There 's a new show at the Kropotkin tonight . They 're not saying what it is , so of course I have to go see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can take the cou  --  " <p> " Most assuredly not . But then again , last month they did the decadent American classic Arsenic and Old Lace . Quite amusing in its original version . Of course , in theirs , the Roosevelt character was n't Theodore . And Jonathan was made up to look like the Second Fuhrer  --  " Brettschneider looked up at the three photos on his wall  --  Hitler , Himmler , Bormann  --  Himmler 's was one of the old official ones , from eleven years ago , before the chin operation , not the posthumous new official ones  --  " no , not really the kind of place , the type of plays two young women should see . " <p> " Have a good time , " said Edward . " I have to accompany the Reichsminister 's wife to the Turkish thing . " <p> " Oh ? Yes ? How 's your Turkish ? " <p> " It 's being given in English , I am led to believe . I 'll drop back in later today , in any case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorway . For all he knew , Edward might be a colonel in the G.S.P. <p> " It 's too bad they do n't make Zambesi cigarettes anymore , " said Caspar , the scene designer , as he smoked one of Peter 's cheap German cigars . " We 'd have them free . It was before your time , before you met Brecht , back in the early Twenties . He was always trying to write pirate movies and detective novels . Before Marx . He designed an ad campaign for the tobacco company . He took an unlimited supply of Zambesis in payment . He grew to detest them before the company went out of business I thought them quite good . " <p> " I 'd give anything to smoke a Camel again , " said Shemp . They were putting down tablecloths and ashtrays , and lighting the candles out front . Zero was pumping up the beer spigots over behind the bar . Madame was , as usual , nowhere to be seen , but , say something wrong , you could be sure she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought that someone , somewhere , was n't thinking about Bertolt Brecht . <p> " I heard they do n't make them over there anymore , " said Caspar . " The Turks , you know ? They claim , in Germany , Airship Brand is the same thing as Camels used to be . " <p> " They 're as full of shit as Christmas geese , " said Shemp . " God , what I would n't give for a slice of goose ! " <p> And so it went until time to open , when the Madame suddenly appeared in front of Peter and said , " You work the door until 1930 hours . Then you may get into costume . " <p> " Yes , comrade Madame , " he said . <p> There was no use arguing with her . It would have been like asking Rondo Hatton , Why the long face ? <p> He went to the door . Under the covered walkway quite a nice crowd had gathered early . Peter looked at the sign out front with its double silhouette of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Cabaret Kropotkin  --  The Zurcher Ensemble  --  new BRECHT play ! <p> It was n't really Brecht . It was n't exactly a play . It was n't exactly new . They 'd been working on it steadily in the three years since Brecht 's death . <p> He undid the latches as the people surged expectantly toward him . He opened the doors , stood back , nodded his head toward the tables . <p> " Trough 's open , " he said . <p> Brettschneider arrived a few minutes to eight , went in , nodded to Caspar , who was bartending , and found a spot at a table near the stage with three Swiss students . He listened to their talk a while  --  it must be nice to live in their world . They were treating the night as a lark ; a dangerous place , reputed to be filled with drugs and lady Bolsheviks with mattresses tied to their backs . <p> Hesse was over in the corner . Brettschneider nodded to him . He doubted the old man saw him , as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , 83 years old now ) ; he would go over and say hello during the interval . <p> There were a few of what passed as Swiss celebrities present , some Germans , a few Swiss arms dealers . <p> Across the length of the stage was the patented Zurcher Ensemble half-curtain let down on a length of pipe . Behind it was the bare back wall . Across this were strung a few twinkling lights , like a Christmas tree with too few bulbs . People moved back and forth across the stage , quite visible to the audience from the neck up . <p> The band took its place in front of the curtain  --  banjo , piano , clarinet  --  and began a jazz arrangement of " The Internationale "  --  one or two people stood , and the rest began clapping along . When that was done , they played the old favorite " Moon of Alabama " from Mahoganny , and " Do n't Sit Under the Apple tree with Anyone Else but Me . " Brettschneider drank a chocolate schnapps and began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blue smoke of a hundred different tobaccos . <p> Then the lights went down . From the ceiling a sign dropped : Cabaret Kropotkin  --  a hand came down from above and beat on the top of the sign , which unfolded into three parts : Cabaret Kropotkin  --  The Zurcher Ensemble Presents Bertolt Brecht 's  --  Die Dreiraketenmensch Spaceoper ! The half-curtain came up . Another sign dropped in : Scene : The Rocket Men 's Club . Time : The Future . Moritaten . <p> An actor dressed as a blind man came on with a barrel organ and began singing " The Night We Dropped the Big One on Biggin Hill . " <p> Zero , Peter , and Shemp , in their Rocket Men Cadet uniforms , walk by the beggar who is then escorted offstage by a policeman . <p> " Here we are at last " says Zero . " Just out of Basic Training ! Our first taste of the Outer Reaches ! " <p> " I 'm ready for some inner reaches ! " says Shemp . <p> " Beer again ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bar 's interior , tables . Dropping in were huge posters of von Braun and Dornberger , and a portrait in the frame reserved for Fuhrers . The audience found it hilarious . <p> Brettschneider wrote in his notebook Unnecessary fun made of Himmler Jr . <p> When things quit falling , unfurling and drooping in from the overheads , there were swastikas whirling like propellers and a giant , very pink rocket with a purple nose cone to be seen . <p> The three students then sang , as appropriate title cards were revealed , " It 's Me for the Stars , and the Stars for Me , " followed by Zero 's " Once You Get Up There . " Then one of their instructor officers , Major Strasser , came in and had a drink with them . <p> " But do n't you find it cold here ? " asks Peter . <p> " We Germans must get used to all climates , from the Sahara to the poles of Saturn , " says the major . <p> Then the chorines danced on and sang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not of cadets but true Rocket Men , danced on , including one small grotesque figure in sunglasses . <p> Brettschneider wrote : more " " " H. Jr. , beneath his first entry . <p> The cadets and Rocket Men ran off with the chorines , and a new card dropped in : The Field for Rockets . Training . On one side of the fence the three cadets stood at attention ; on the other a girl skipped rope to the chant : <p> " My girlfriend 's name is Guernica . <p> Her Daddy bombed ' Merika ... " <p> The Drill Instructor , called Manley Mann , comes on and yells at the cadets . <p> " Where you going , you stupid lot ? " <p> " Up Up Up . " <p> " How you goin ' ? " <p> " Fast Fast Fast . " <p> " At night , whatcha see inna sky ? " <p> " Nazi Socialist Moon ! " <p> " Gim me a thousand pushups . " <p> The cadets dropped down , began to count , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weapon ... " There was stage business with the pushups , most of it dealing with Zero 's attempts to do nothing while yelling at the top of his voice . <p> When they finished , Manley Mann said , " Right . Today we 're gon na learn about the MD2D3 Course Plottin ' Calculator . Walk smart follow me follow me  --  " and off . <p> Another card : Six Weeks Later . Cadet Barracks . Night . <p> Then came Shemp 's solo , as he looked out the window at a bored-looking stagehand holding up a cardboard moon . He did some comic patter , then went on to sing " I Wish I Had a Little Rocket of My Own . <p> Then the lights went up , the Intermission sign dropped down , and the half-curtain was lowered to the stage . <p> Backstage the Madame was furious . " I told you we must take that song out ! " she yelled at Shemp . " You realize you made the audience identify with your character ? You know that 's against all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' Song of the Iron Will . " Shemp weaved like a punch-drunk boxer , running his hands through his dank , lanky hair . " I got mixed up , " he said . " They played the wrong music , so I sang it . Yell at the band . " <p> " You must always always remember the Verfremsdungeffekt . You must always remind people they are watching a performance . Why do you think the stagehand holds the prop moon so everyone can see him ? Are you an idiot ? What were you thinking ? " <p> Shemp paused , ticking off on his fingers . " I do . I always do . I do n't know . Yes . Nothing . " <p> " Why must I be saddled with morons ? " Shemp said something under his breath . <p> " What ? ! What did you say ? ! " <p> " I said I got ta get a drink of water , or I 'm gon na lose my voice next act . " <p> " That 's not what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comrade Ma'am . " <p> " Get out of my sight ! " <p> " At once , " said Shemp , and disappeared offstage . <p> Zero sat on a crate in the alleyway . It was bitterly cold , but this was the only place he was sure Madame would n't follow him . Peter came out , lit up a butt one of the waiters had brought him from a customer 's ashtray . <p> " We got ta find another way to make a living , " said Zero , his breath a fog . <p> " We 've said that every night for sixteen years now , " said Peter . " Christ , it 's cold ! " <p> " Was n't it Fitzgerald that said nothing much starts in Switzerland , but lots of things end there ? " <p> " How the fuck should I know ? " said Peter . <p> " Well , I do n't want to be one of the things that ends here , " said Zero . <p> Peter thought of lines from a movie he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expatriation , and death , and started to say one of them , but did n't . Besides , they 'd already used the best lines from that movie in the play . <p> " It 's like I told that fat great Limey actor once , " said Peter . " ' Chuck , ' I said , ' if you have to pork young men , just go for god 's sake and do it , and come back and learn your goddamn lines ; just quit torturing yourself about it ! " <p> " Are you saying I should pick up a little boy ? " asked Zero . <p> Peter shrugged his shoulders . " Where else is there to go but here , Zero ? " he asked . <p> Zero was quiet . Then : " Sometimes I get so tired , Pete . Soon we 'll be old men . Like Bruno . Then dead old men . <p> " But theater !  --  " began Peter . <p> "  --  and Brecht !  --  " said Zero . <p> "  --  will live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Zero fell off his crate into the snow . Then they brushed themselves off and went back inside . <p> Brettschneider had made his rounds of the tables during the break . He looked over his notes , made an emendation on one of them . He ate a kaiser roll , then drank a gin-and-tonic , feeling the pine-needle taste far back in his throat . <p> Then the band came back , played the last-act overture , and cards dropped back in . <p> There was a classroom lecture on the futurist films of Fritz Lang , Metropolis and Frau im Mond , which then went backwards and forwards to cover other spaceward-looking films : Himmelskibet , F.P.1 . Antwortet Nicht , Der Tunnel and Welttraumschiff I Startet , at which Zero insisted on confusing Leni Reifenstahl with the Dusseldorf Murdered . <p> Brettschneider wrote : unacceptable reference to Reichsminister for Culture . <p> Then the play moved on to Graduation Day , where the massed cadets ( represented by the three actors , some mops and brooms with mustaches painted on them , and a boxful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and were handed their rocket insignia . <p> The actors changed onstage into their powder-blue uniforms ( overalls ) with the jackboots ( rubber galoshes ) as a sign came down : First Assignment . Rocket Man City  --  Peenemunde . <p> Another sign : Suddenly  --  A Propaganda Crisis ! <p> Major Strasser comes up to the three Rocket Men . " Suddenly , " he says , " a propaganda crisis ! " <p> " Eeep Eeep Eeep Eeep ! " says Shemp , staggering . <p> " Attention ! " says the major . " Our enemies in the U.S.R. far beyond the Urals have launched one of their primitive reaction-motor ships . It is bound for the far reaches of the Solar System . Our information is that it is filled with the Collected Works of Marx and Lenin , and the brilliant but non-Aryan playwright Bertolt Brecht . " <p> ( There was a boo from the audience , followed by laughter . The actors onstage held still until it was over . ) <p> " Your first assignment is to intercept this missile before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beyond , and to destroy it . " <p> There was a blackout ; four signs were illuminated , one after the other : <p> Three Go Out . <p> One Gets Killed . <p> One Goes Mad . <p> One Does n't Come Back . <p> The first two signs were lit . In the darkness , Zero is in a balsawood framework shaped like a small rocket . To his uniform has been added a bent coat hanger representing a space helmet . <p> His voice is roaring , he is determined . The band is raucous behind him but his singing overpowers it . <p> " Target in sight ! <p> It 's easy , all right ! <p> Just line up the guns <p> and watch all the fu- <p> Ooops ! " <p> A papier-mache meteor , painted red and trailing smoke vertically , comes out of the darkness . It smashes into Zero 's ship , which flies to flinders . Zero , his coat-hanger helmet now gone , floats up into the air on wires in the dark , a hideous grin on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mad . <p> Shemp 's balsawood spaceship . Zero floats directly in front of it . " Whoa ! " yells Shemp . He punches things on his instrument panel , running his hands over his coat hanger . " Eeep Eeep Eeep Eeep ! " Then he sits bolt upright , unmoving except for the lips , making perfect sense in a monotonous voice , reciting the successive graph plots on a Fibonacci curve , as he and his ship , trailing vertical smoke , are pulled by ropes out of the light into the darkness at the back of the stage . <p> The spotlight searches around , finds the sign : One Does n't Come Back . Peter in his ship . He is mumbling the Soldier 's Creed . At the other side of the stage , light comes up on a toy rocket . Peter takes out a dart gun , fires twice at the toy , his arm outside the ship 's framework as he reloads the rubber-tipped darts . One finally hits the toy rocket  --  it explodes like a pinata . <p> Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience to jump , and Peter 's ship is bathed in flickering red light . " Uh-oh. " he says . " Trouble . " Then the band begins to play softly , and he sings " I Wonder What Deborah 's Doing in Festung Amerika Tonight ? " <p> The ship tilts downwards . <p> Blackout . A sign : Mars . <p> When the lights come back up the stage is clear . A red silk drop cloth covers the ground . For a full minute , nothing happens . Then Peter 's balsawood ship , him inside , flies out of the wings and he lands flat on his ass , legs straight out while pieces of wood bounce all over . <p> He stands up , brushes himself off . As he does so , stagehands begin to ripple the red silk , making it look like drifting , gently blowing sand . Peter takes off his coat hanger , takes a deep breath . A book falls from above , bounces at the rear of the moving red stage . Then another follows . Peter looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire . He reaches up and plucks it from the air . Others fall around him occasionally throughout the scene . Peter begins to read . His eyes widen even more . He looks up at the audience . He reads more . Then he stands up . " Holy dialectical shit ! " he says . <p> Then the lights came up , and the chorines , stagehands , actors ushers and dishwashers came in , taking their bows . Zero floated down from the ceiling on his wires , blowing kisses . Then the Madame came out , glaring at Zero , turned and took a bow to the audience for having survived Brecht . <p> Then they all passed among the tables , holding out baskets for donations . <p> Brettschneider stayed at his table drinking , while the audience mingled with the members of the Ensemble . He noticed that he 'd written nothing in his notebook since the couple of entries just after intermission . When he saw Peter take something from Madame , put on his coat and go out the door , Brettschneider wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gathered up his own things , nodded to Caspar who was still tending bar , and went back to his home and to bed . <p> Christ , it 's even colder than this morning , thought Peter . He turned off the main avenue , went down a side street . The snow , which this morning had seemed so white and pure , was now gray , crusted ice . Even so , as he turned into a small courtyard , he saw that only a few sets of footprints had come and gone that way the whole day . <p> Near the middle was a rusty iron gate . He went in with a loud groaning squeal from the metal . On the wall was a brass plate that said Union of Soviet Republics Consular Offices . Peter went to the mail drop , took the envelope out of his thin overcoat pocket . On the outside , written in Madame 's florid scrip was From Your Comrades at the Cabaret Kropotkin . Peter tore open the envelope , took out a few hundred francs , slapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it around twice with some twine , and dropped it in the slot . <p> As Brecht had said : First the beans , then the morals . <p> He went back up the avenue , crunching through the frosty ice on the way . The night was still clear , bitterly frigid . He looked up at the winking stars and saw the slow-moving dot of Space Platform #6 on its two-hour orbit . <p> He heard a streetcar bell . He knew of a place he could go and get a cup of real coffee and watch a fireplace burning for an hour or two , where the thought of Herr Brecht would never cross his mind . He began whistling " In the Hall of the Mountain King . " <p>
