Listening to the latest CD by the hard-rock band Korn made me think of those automatic toilets at airports ; you know , the kind that flush when you move away . Korn is drawn to the dregs , society 's emotional refuse , exploring  --  none too deeply  --  such issues as suicide and child molestation . There 's even a new song titled Trash . In the past , the group 's music has been tinged with hip-hop . Issues is virtually all yowling , sludgy rock . In fact , it 's almost undifferentiated white noise , as if the band were content to echo the roar of its crowd . This CD has a few intriguing moments of raw energy . Still , I 'm waiting for the flush . <P>  --  By Christopher John Farley
