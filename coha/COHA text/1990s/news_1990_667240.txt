<p> Susan Love , 42 , is director of the Faulkner Breast Center in Jamaica Plain , Mass. , and clinical assistant professor of surgery at the Harvard Medical School . She is author of Dr. Susan Love 's Breast Book . Dr. Love was interviewed by USA TODAY 's Wendy Benedetto about the nation 's progress in the fight against breast cancer and what more needs to be done to conquer the disease . Q : Breast cancer specialists recently called for doubling the money for research . Why ? Has it become a more urgent problem for women ? <p> A : Women have noticed what happened with AIDS . The funding for AIDS is way above the funding for breast cancer , and the attention is , too . We noticed that when the gay male community started organizing , making a loud noise and lobbying , they were able to increase funding and increase attention . Q : How much money goes to fight each disease ? <p> A : I think last year 's budget was $ 77 million on breast cancer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really finding a cure , as opposed to looking at different kinds of drugs and things like that . At the same time , $ 752 million was spent on AIDS . Q : Is breast cancer becoming more widespread in this country ? <p> A : I think it is becoming more common . Currently , one woman in 10 will get breast cancer in their lifetime . When they calculate the new numbers , it may be one in eight . It really is an epidemic . Q : Has treatment improved ? <p> A : We 've certainly maximized our usage of chemotherapy , radiation and surgery . We do n't have to do mastectomies the majority of the time . We 've certainly improved the disease-free survival , and in some cases the overall survival of women using chemotherapy . And early detection also has improved mortality rates . But none of it is enough . Q : What 's the best it can do ? <p> A : The best early detection will decrease mortality by 30% . That 's great if you 're one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improving survival by 10% or 15% . That 's great , but that 's not a whole lot . What we need is completely new and different ways of treating this disease . And they 're going to come from the basic science laboratory . Some of them are just on the verge of being able to be tested on people . Q : Why has n't breast cancer received more funding ? <p> A : Part of the problem is that it 's a woman 's disease . The people who have controlled research money have been men , and so it 's just not as high a concern . I do n't think they 're consciously saying , " We wo n't pay attention to this because it 's a woman 's disease . " I just think that , given the option of , say , heart disease , which attacks men more than breast cancer , they 're more likely to lean toward heart disease . Q : What are the best treatments right now ? <p> A : One thing that 's really exciting , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate , is that we 've shown that you do n't need to do as aggressive surgery as we originally thought . Lumpectomy and radiation have been shown to be as good as mastectomy for a majority of women . Q : Do you think this is going to turn into a political fight ? <p> A : I think that women are going to organize . However , I 'm not sure who we 'd be fighting with . I do n't know anyone who 's saying , " Absolutely , breast cancer is a stupid disease and you should n't spend money on it . " Q : Are women upset with doctors over this ? <p> A : Well , partly . Part of the reason women do n't get mammographies is because their doctors do n't tell them to . That means the doctor is not keeping up with what the current recommendations are . In addition , I think that , depending on where the woman lives , doctors do n't always give them all their options for treatment and they do n't always give them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be able to have lumpectomy and radiation , 70% still get mastectomies . Part of that is the physician who is saying , " Well , I 've always done it this way , and it works . " Q : How often are the results of a mammogram wrong ? <p> A : Mammography will miss about 15% of cancers at best . But the quality of mammography varies and , until recently , there 's been no way of accrediting mammography centers . Q : And now there is ? <p> A : In Michigan , they were going to do a big mammography-screening study , and so they wanted all the mammographers to get accredited by the American College of Radiology . These were voluntary . Of the people who volunteered to be accredited , only 50% passed . So you know that a large percentage of the people who are doing mammography do n't have the level of expertise that they need . Q : Who is most at risk for breast cancer ? <p> A : We know it seems to be related to hormones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than women . We know that if you have your first pregnancy early , that seems to be more protective than if you have your first pregnancy late . We know that the strongest risk factor is having it in a first-degree relative - mother , sister or daughter . Or having had it in one breast , and then you 're more likely to get it in the other breast . Or the older you are , the higher your risk . Q : Are there other , lesser risk factors ? <p> A : The younger you are with your first period , the more you 're at risk . And the older you are with menopause . The problem is that 70% of women who get breast cancer have no risk factors whatsoever . Q : Are there ways to protect yourself ? <p> A : One of the things that has been mentioned is a low-fat diet . Women in Japan have much less breast cancer , and they certainly have a lower-fat diet . Anthony Miller of Canada says that if we all went on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of breast cancer . Q : What are the odds of beating it after you get it ? <p> A : If you have early breast cancer , the survival rate is somewhere around 80% . It 's actually quite good . Not everyone who gets breast cancer dies of it , by any means . And we do cure a lot of people . Q : What would you tell women to do to help with this ? <p> A : We have to be more vocal . On an individual level , we have to go in and tell our doctors , " I want a mammogram . Why are n't you sending me for one ? " On a community level , we have to make sure that the mammography-screening facilities are accredited by the American College of Radiation or follow its guidelines . Q : And on higher levels ? <p> A : On a state level , we need to make sure that mammography is covered by insurance and that screening programs are available to women of all socioeconomic and cultural levels . Nationally , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that we need more money for research , that we need more attention to women 's health issues . CUTLINE : Susan Love
