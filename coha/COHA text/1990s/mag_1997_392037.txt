Cataloguing an important private collection in Saint Louis , Missouri , presented me with the opportunity to study a veritable aviary of Worcester 's finest birds , all exotic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zorensky began collecting porcelain in 1970 they soon realized that the only way to learn about Worcester was to be as comprehensive as possible . Instead of buying only the best , which they could well afford , they collected the factory 's bread-and-butter production as well . Nearly three decades later the result is not only the largest collection of Worcester porcelain in private hands , but also the most diverse and complete . Every aspect of Worcester 's output is represented , and bird decoration is prominent in every section . A group of fifteen investors formed what they called the Facing page : Worcester Porcelain Company in 1751 to exploit the invention of Dr. John Wall ( 1708-1776 ) and the local apothecary William Davis ( 1710-1791 ) .2 Their secret formula produced a durable porcelain that did not crack when subjected to hot liquids , and the fame of Worcester teawares spread far and wide . The firm 's success meant that Worcester porcelain could be sold on its own merits and , unlike its rivals Bow and Chelsea , it did not have to hide behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Germany . Other English makers copied foreign porcelain directly . Worcester chose instead to adapt the best decoration from all worlds and combine them with shapes borrowed from English silver . The factory 's earliest bird painting is an example , for it uses , but rarely copies , a mixture of famille rose and famille verte decoration from Chinese export porcelain . Apart from a few objects made by Worcester to replace broken pieces from Chinese export services , early Worcester birds are not found on Oriental porcelain , for they are unique , and therein lies their charm .

Porcelain , height 10 1/2 inches . The decoration incorporates Worcester 's Mobbing Birds ( left ) and Birds in Impossible Flight ( below ) . // These Shutting Birds , as they have come to be called , were painted between 1752 and about 1755 on simple cream jugs and sauceboats and fluted cups and saucers . Cartoonlike , they are subtly humorous , perched precariously on one leg , their heads raised or lowered as part of a crazy mating ritual . The two shutting birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with good reason , for they are sandwiched between Chinese lotus and bamboo and Japanese prunus-a combination typical of Worcester bout 1756 the existence of a wealthy London market for porcelain brought about a change of direction at Worcester . By that time Chelsea copies of Meissen decoration had found ready customers tired of Chinese imagery.3 Worcester then copied the Chelsea copies , but in so doing used its own palette and replaced the very detailed stipple painting of Chelsea with much more subtle shading , conveying a greater sense of distance and perspective . This is seen to best advantage in the so-called Rogers style of bird painting . James Rogers is the best-known name associated with Worcester bird painting , but also the most misunderstood . The origin of the problem is a Worcester mug ( in the British Museum in London ) that is painted with birds and inscribed ' I. Rogers Pinxit 1757 " on the bottom.4 The search for a painter whose name would fit uncovered a reference to a James Rogers who worked as an " Engraver and Enameller " for a London China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring " in less compass than a silver penny . There is absolutely no evidence to suggest a link between this James Rogers and the I. Rogers who inscribed the mug in the British Museum . We do not even know if " I " stood for James . A number of different painters were responsible for Worcester 's birds and landscapes , for known examples vary widely in quality and exhibit markedly different mannerisms . The Zorensky collection has several splendid jugs painted in this most decorative style , but they are categorically not by the I. Rogers who painted the British Museum 's mug . The leaf-molded jug shown in Plates IIIa and IIIb is a shape known in the eighteenth century as a Dutch jug . It displays the most elaborate surviving example of the Mobbing Birds pattern , 6 a subject copied from Chelsea and no doubt derived originally from Meissen . On one side a number of birds perch in a single , rather flimsy , tree , which miraculously supports their combined weight . Several cheeky little birds squawk to annoy a pheasantlike bird in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to preen its wing , oblivious to the mischief going on around it . On some examples of the pattern an alarmed owl sits among the mobbing birds . When this pattern was used on vases or large jugs , the space around the tree was usually filled with simple flower sprays and a few flying bids . The Zorensky jug , on the other hand , is smothered by fanciful creatures and imaginary insects that have come to be known as Birds in Impossible Flight . The origin of these bizarre birds must ultimately be Meissen , but I can not help seeing in their absurd frozen positions something akin to the naive bird painting encountered on English delftware . In addition , sheets of engravings published by the London print dealer Robert Sayer included the work of Charles Fenn , whose paintings of birds were engraved by Robert Hancock ( c. 1730-1817 ) , an active partner and the senior engraver in the Worcester firm . The factory almost certainly owned a copy of Sayer 's book of prints entitled The Ladies ' Amusement , which was an invaluable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fenn in Sayer 's compendium served as inspiration for the Birds in Impossible Flight .

Mug , Worcester porcelain factory , c.1758-1760 . Porcelain , height 4 3/4 inches The decoration is an unusual com of Worcester 's Fancy Birds and chinoiserie. // Transfer printing onto porcelain was a new invention in the mid-eighteenth century and was regarded as a serious art form . It was first successfully practiced at Worcester about 1753 , and by 1756 , the probable date of the mug shown in Plate IV , the technique had been perfected.9 The proud cockerel was almost certainly engraved by Hancock , whose many transfer prints of birds are usually found only in a single grayish black color . This mug is a rarity since the print has been hand colored . Worcester had difficulty controlling enamel colors on top of detailed transfer prints , and few survive with contemporary coloring . Some of the transfer-printed birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggesting that Hancock worked alongside the factory 's artists . The bell-shaped mug in Plate V dates from the same period as the jug in Plates IIIa and IIIb , but it could not be more different . Instead of the realistic Mobbing Birds , the mug displays one of the earliest exampies of the Fancy Birds pattern , which dominated the following two decades . It is my feeling that this is a very important transitional piece . When I was learning about Worcester porcelain I was taught that the Fancy Birds pattern was derived from the bird painting done at Sevres , France , in the 1750s . However , while a French influence does develop , this mug of about 1760 appears to combine Worcester 's chinoiserie style with its Mobbing Birds , and leads me to believe that the factory invented its own Fancy Birds pattern , albeit borrowing heavily from Chelsea . Fancy Birds is the name that appeared in catalogues of eighteenth-century ceramics factories.10 Collectors have loved Fancy Birds since the middle of the nineteenth century and later in that century gave them many different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used by collectors , and there are many variations to describe specific types of Worcester birds , including Aggressive , Agitated , or Dishevelled Birds.lt Reference books never attempt specific classification of these terms , which mean different things to different collectors , and thus much confusion has reigned . In my Dictionary of Worcester Porcelain I attempt to clarify the different types . For example , the chirpy little bird looking alert but decidedly uncomfortable amongst leafy compact foliage on the yellow-ground dish in Plate VI is a classic specimen of Agitated Birds , which was the Worcester factory 's version of London bird painting from the dying days of Chelsea . The style of painting is formal and two dimensional , suiting the restricted confines of the reserved panel . A great deal of study has been devoted to attempting to separate the porcelain painted at the Worcester factory from the work of James Giles , an independent porcelain painter working in London . Giles bought Worcester blanks and painted them with images copied from the decoration on the most fashionable Continental imports from Meissen and Sevres . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in complete contrast to all other English porcelain painting and to the formal Worcester style in particular As the Zorenskys have a great interest in porcelain decorated by Giles , 12 I was delighted when they were able to buy the tea canister in Plate VIII . It was part of a complete tea service of Giles-decorated porcelain I had found lying unrecognized in a house in London in 1988 and sold at Phillips in London the following year.l3 Although it is chipped and lacks its cover , the tea canister bears a particularly clear painting of the epitome of a Giles bird . It also perfectly illustrates the Zorenskys ' attitude in their collecting : quality and rarity come first , and damage is a secondary consideration . The key to understanding the difference between Giles 's decorative work and that produced at the Worcester factory lies in their different points of view . German porcelain painting of the period between about 1765 and 1770 is much bolder than the earher style practiced at Meissen , and Giles observed these new wares with open eyes . The decorators at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued to paint in the same way they had always done , for their wares sold well and they saw no reason to change things . Some truly wonderful vases were produced about 1770 as the Fancy Bird decoration reached its zenith . The Zorenskys own two pairs of hexagonal , blue-ground vases that share the same pride of place in their collection as similar pairs in the collection of Her Majesty the Queen and many other fine porcelain collections around the world . They are tremendous things , but there is a stiffness and formality to the painting that means all such vases are very much the same . Interestingly , when I was still in school , aged fourteen and learning about Worcester porcelain from my father , I tried my hand at copying birds much like those on the vases in Plate I , and , surprisingly , found it was quite easy . While Giles 's birds are painted with spontaneity , the Worcester Fancy Birds have none . Identical birds are found on a number of different vases , indicating that the painters copied designs with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Worcester bird painting in the nineteenth century , they found it remarkably easy to turn out convincing copies , at times indistinguishable from the real thing.14 Photograph Pl .

The painting of Worcester 's Fancy Birds in a landscape setting is attributed to George Davis . // Worcester 's Fancy Birds were copied by other English makers including Bow and Derby in the 1770s,15 but public taste changed rapidly and by 1780 classical styles replaced the rococo in fashionable London . As a gesture to the new styles , Worcester introduced a fluted teaware shape and decoration that included deep blue and gold borders and formal festoons . The Fancy Birds painting continued , but it was updated , and what a transformation . The birds on the teapot in Plate VII are still formal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand in a delicately toned landscape with its own clear feeling of distance . When I saw this teapot in the Zorensky collection I had an immediate thought that I had seen the same birds before but not on a piece from the same factory . They turned out to be very similar to those on a tea bowl and saucer dated 1794 from the factory established in Worcester in 1788 by Robert Chamberlain ( c. 1736-1798 ) and his son Humphrey ( 1762-1841 ) .16 About 1786 the Chamberlains had deserted their former employers , the Flight family , which had direction of the original Worcester factory from 1783 , to set up their own works , taking many of the factory 's painters and gilders with them . Surviving records show that the artist responsible for painting Fancy Birds on early Chamberlain porcelain was George Davis , 17 a decorator who enjoyed a long career in Worcester . The similarities between the birds and landscape on the Zorenskys ' teapot and on the Chamberlain tea bowl and saucer convince me that they are by the same painter , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Flight factory before the Chamberlains . After thirty-five years of glorious production , formal bird painting came to an end at the original Worcester factory in the late 1780s ( although it would be revived in the nineteenth century ) . The examples featured in this article along with the many others included in the Zorensky collection and catalogue are a perfect tribute to the skill and imagination of the china painters of Worcester .
