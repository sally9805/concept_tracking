Hart , son of a Shakespeare professor and a mathematician , decided to harness the new technology to humanistic ends by posting a copy of the Declaration of Independence that anyone with a computer and a modem could read for free . <P> Hart called his fledgling Internet site Project Gutenberg . Since then , with less than $100,000 in foundation money and 1,000 volunteers worldwide who hunt down books , type or scan them in and proofread , he has assembled a library of 2,250 entries .
