The summer after I was graduated from law school , I moved to Washington to work at the law firm of Freid and Heller , which people called " Fried in Hell . " It was a second-rate firm , small , shabby , on 14th Street north of New York Avenue . No one I knew had ever worked there before . <p> My father had found me the job . My father , a lawyer , knew a lot of people around town . He knew Freid . He found me the job after I called home , in late April , to tell my mother that my marriage was off , she should cancel the caterers . " What do you mean the marriage is off ? " she said . " I 've already arranged everything . " My mother lived for weddings . She had already given three , for my three older sisters . " The flowers are going to be absolutely magnificent , " she said . There was a long silence . Then she said : " Maybe we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I did n't know what she was talking about . <p> A minute later my father got on the phone . " What are you going to do ? " he said . I started sobbing . " Do n't worry , Emma , " he said , " I 'll get something for you . " <p> So instead of getting married in my parents ' backyard ( there was going to be a chuppah made of white roses and lace , a string quartet , a striped tent ) and then taking an extended honeymoon ( first to the Italian Riviera , where a friend of my fiance 's family was to lend us a house for a month , and then to Rome ) , I lived at home , in Bethesda , and worked at Fried in Hell on a case involving trademark regulations . I was the summer associate on the case . The senior associate was Jim Lazarus . There was nothing remarkable about him . He looked and acted just like everyone else . Which is to say that he wore horn-rimmed glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was losing his hair . It was black , thinning on top , and peaked slightly in the middle , where he had let it grow longer and combed it , sideways , over the thin spot . He nodded to me in the hallways , and , once , smiled sweetly to me across the firm 's cafeteria . I smiled back . He was gunning for partnership . He put in crazy hours . <p> After work , I would come home and cry . " The best thing for you to do is get back out there and date , " my mother told me . " Is n't there anyone nice at the firm ? There must be some nice young men there . " I thought about Jim Lazarus , about his thinning hair . I told my mother about him . I said , " Well , there 's Jim Lazarus , but I do n't like him . " <p> In early July , he hosted a party for the summer associates . It was n't really his party , since the firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , anyway . " The pressure 's really on , " he told me . " Got ta look good for the partners . " Then he told me about his neighborhood . " I like to think of it as the Greenwich Village of Washington , " he said . " Very mixed . Very ethnic . " He lived in Adam 's Morgan . " Lots of homosexuals , " he said . <p> He had the top two floors of a new building halfway up a hill off 18th Street . The apartment was utterly without distinction . The furniture was covered in the kind of nubby off-white fabric that 's designed to come off in little balls between your fingers . In the corners were a few scraggly plants of the sort that adorn hotel lobbies . The one nice thing about it was the view  --  of the Cathedral , and beyond that , the electric-red blaze that was Wisconsin Avenue , and beyond that , a soft , hazy glow of greenish-gray : Washington in the summer , hills and houses , automobile emissions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well-watered lawns . It was the Washington that I remembered from my childhood  --  the city of lawyers chatting on summertime patios , the paper lanterns strung across the trees , the hors d'oeuvres wilting on brightly colored platters . <p> The other summer associates and I drank beer and wine on the roof deck , and talked about what we were going to do after the summer . Now and then a partner or a senior associate would come out , and we 'd all stop talking . Dinner was served . We ate pasta salad and fancy sandwiches , and then , around nine , someone put a record on the stereo and people started dancing . I sat down . I do n't like to dance . It makes me feel weird . John , my ex-fiance , was a great dancer , an enthusiastic dancer . He danced with energy , with fury , twirling me around like a top , twisting me under his arms , spinning me through space . <p> Jim Lazarus came up to me and said , " Why are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like to dance , he said , " Nonsense . " Then he took my hands and pulled me to my feet , and we did a kind of out-of-sync two-step together , with his hands at my waist , and mine , flopping awkwardly , out of place on his shoulders . <p> As we danced , he told me about NYU , where he 'd been on Law Review . I told him I 'd gone to Columbia , where I had n't been on Law Review . He said , " Oh . " Then he told me not to worry about it . " Some of the smartest people I know did n't make it , " he said . When the song was over , I excused myself and sat down . <p> When I got home , I told my mother about it . I said , " It was just completely a drag . " She sat and listened . When I was done , she said , " I think we should have a party , here . " <p> So happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , you would have thought that he 'd just been presented with his first-born : with a son  --  a David , a Jonathan . To my father , there was no greater profession . " You 're a natural , " he said , " It 's in the genes . " During my first year , he telephoned me daily to discuss the cases in my casebook . During my second year , when I was going out for Law Review , he called to talk about my note topic . He wanted me to write on the subject he himself had written on , in 1949 : Can the Negro Be Freed by Law Alone ? My topic was municipal liability for police misconduct . He was convinced , when I did n't make it , that I would have if I 'd done the Negroes instead . <p> At the age of sixty-six , he was still putting in long hours  --  twelve-hour days , weekends , nights  --  for what he called the " sheer pleasure " of it . His office had an Oriental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the younger lawyers were scared of him . They called him " H.B. "  --  short for " Hard Butt . " He was known to be short-tempered , well-prepared , and impatient . Stories circulated about him : how , in 1964 , he had lost a case in Ohio , and thereafter would n't speak to the associate who had been assigned to him ; how he once threw a paperweight out the window ; how he could give you a look so withering that it made you want to go in your pants . Etcetera . I once went out on a date with a guy who told me that my father was the most despised man in his law firm . " No kidding , " he said , laying his hand on mine . We were at a French restaurant , and he had just ordered in French . " H.B. ? People really hate him . " I looked at him  --  at his bland expression , his horn-rimmed glasses , his thinning hair  --  and thought about doing something really dramatic . I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought about slapping him . I thought about saying " F  --  you . " I did n't . I blushed , then said , " Really ? " <p> When we were children , my father used to speak about one day starting a firm called " Posner , Posner , Posner , Posner , and Posner . " But one by one my three older sisters took up something else , and then , in chronological order , fell in love and got married . Each was married in the backyard of my parents ' house in June . Each time the house filled with boxes delivered by the UPS man , and people said , " Have you ever seen such a beautiful bride ? " And my father , it seemed to us , tolerated it , but just barely  --  he stood there in his tux and tolerated it  --  but only because he had to . The last time was for my sister Hilary , and I was in baby blue , and happy because I would be next . After the ceremony , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographer to take the pictures of the wedding party , my mother sent me inside to get him . I found him in his study , sitting in the armchair across from the bookshelves . He was gazing at the bookshelves , at the titles of the books . He was drinking Scotch . <p> " Emma , " he said when he saw me . " Do n't do this to me . Do n't do this to your old man . " <p> " Mom wants you , " I said . <p> " Do n't get married , " he said . <p> On Father 's Day my sisters sent chirpy , cheerful cards , cards in the shape of Donald Duck or Snoopy , cards that read , " To the Greatest ( Grand ) Dad in the Whole Wide World , " signed with their children 's names . My mother taped them on the refrigerator door and they yellowed in the sun . <p> At my last sister 's wedding , I danced because I was happy , and did n't care if I looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got tired of dragging me around the dance floor , whispering " one , two , one , two , " into my ear , and went off to find a better partner . <p> THAT was the thing about John : he was never completely satisfied . He was always searching , always striving . " You should n't settle , " he 'd say . " You should never get completely comfortable in your own skin . " I thought he meant that I should n't give up on my dreams , no matter what anyone else 's opinion might be . But then he broke off the engagement , and everything he had said to me took on a different meaning . <p> About three weeks before final exams , he had told me that he just could n't do it . " You just ca n't do what ? " I said . We were in Riverside Park , walking , and I remember thinking how lovely it all was : the Hudson shining flat and silvery beneath a soft gray sky , the Palisades rising on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drive . <p> " I 'm not sure you want me to go through with it , " he said . <p> Then the meaning of his words began to dawn on me , and I felt sick . We kept walking , calmly , hand-in-hand . We came to a park bench , sat down . " What do you mean ? " I said . <p> " Emma , " he said , very , very softly . " It 's not you . " <p> " What 's not me ? " <p> " It 's not your fault . " <p> Finally , I got mad , and told him that I knew it was n't my fault , because I had n't done anything . " What are you talking about ? " I said . <p> " I think , " he said , " that maybe I like , you know . " <p> " ' You know ? ' " <p> " Men , " he whispered . <p> Then his face crumpled and he began to cry . He liked men I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ athletic , with a square chin , closely shaved . He was also twenty-seven , a fact which I pointed out to him . " Is n't it a little late to be discovering that maybe you like men ? " <p> He sat there a little while longer , crying softly , which really made me angry , because I was the one who should have been crying , and instead I was sitting there , calm as ice . Then he told me that he 'd been seeing a therapist . " To work it out , " he said . " Because , you know , my family is going to be completely horrified . " John was clerking that year for a judge in Brooklyn ; now he told me that he 'd secretly " been seeing " his co-clerk , Eric . ( That was the phrase he used , " been seeing . " ) Eric publicized the fact that he had recently come out of the closet by wearing a small diamond , which he liked to stroke , in his left ear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't like him , because he was always making jokes that ended with the word " splewy , " which was his word for semen . <p> " So you and Eric are going off into the sunset together ? " I finally said . <p> " We broke up , " he said . " But I thought you should know . " <p> Later , he told me that he had wanted to tell me in plenty of time to cancel the wedding plans . " And I wanted to give you enough time to study for finals , " he said . He did n't want to screw things up completely for me , he said . " I still love you , Emma , " he said . " I always will . " But he screwed things up for me anyway . <p> Given my father 's connections , he should have been able to do better for me than Freid and Heller . Freid and Heller was the kind of firm that he himself would n't be caught dead in . " C-plus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His firm , meanwhile , got the best of the yearly law-school crop : the Law Review editors , the Moot Court finalists , the honors students . When I was a child , these bright young men ( because in those days , of course , there were virtually no women lawyers ) would appear on our patio , usually on a Saturday night and usually in mid-July , where they would eat deviled eggs and miniature weenies , and drink vodka-and-tonics . <p> My sisters and I passed the hors d'oeuvres , and , when we got to be a little older , stayed up late to eat with the grownups . One summer , when my oldest sister was in college , she slipped off with one of the guests  --  his name was Bud  --  and did n't return until after dinner was served . It was the early 70 's : she was wearing a peasant blouse , and no bra , and a skirt that she had made herself from an old pair of blue jeans . Bud had a beard . When they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at them and said , " Uh huh . " Later my sister told me that she and Bud had been walking around the neighborhood , just walking and walking , and he had told her that after law school he was going to go down South , to work for the NAACP . When I asked her what the NAACP was , she told me I was stupid . <p> I never wanted to come back to Washington , partly because of those parties , and partly because of guys like Bud , who worshipped their own potential . I also did n't like the weather . I wanted to stay in New York , where things were grittier . In Washington , everything was muted , civil . In New York , nothing was . I liked that . <p> But once I was back in my parents ' house it was as if no other place had ever existed , or ever could : it was as if their walls , their dinners , the humming of their air-conditioning , and the creaking of their floors were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rec-room in the basement was still filled with unreturned wedding presents , because , as my mother put it , I " had to face up to the stark reality . " The desk drawers in my bedroom were still filled with my old diaries . My stuffed animals still sat on the bed and told me things . Why do n't you get off your tuches and do something ? <p> About a week after the party at Jim Lazarus 's house my mother came into my room , where I was lying on my bed reading a magazine , and said : " How 's the third of August for you ? " <p> " What are you talking about ? " <p> " The third of August , " she said , sitting down at the end of my bed . " You plan to be here ? " <p> I did n't know what she meant , because other than the fact that I dressed every morning and went to work at Freid and Heller , I had no plans at all . Or , I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : think about where you want to live . And : do something interesting . <p> " Daddy and I want to do something nice for you , " she said , in the same tone of voice that she had used , ten years earlier , when she told me that she was n't going to let me go with my friends for a weekend in Virginia Beach . " Plus we 'd been planning to have a party of some kind  --  you know , like the kind we used to have , when you were children . So we 're going to go ahead and have the young people 's party . We 're going to invite all the young people we know . " <p> I sat up . My parents had a wide circle of friends , but young people , as far as I knew , were not among them . But now my mother was telling me about some people named Holly and Brian , and someone else named Joshua Blumenthal , and someone from Boston whose father had been my father 's freshman-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . Then she named a whole lot of other people  --  old friends of my sisters who were still in town , and their spouses , associates at my father 's law firm , distant cousins . Then she asked me whom , of my friends , I 'd like to invite . I thought and I thought , but I could n't think of anyone . I had n't spoken to my law-school friends all summer and there was no one at Freid and Heller I liked . <p> " No one , " I said . <p> " What about Nina ? " my mother said . <p> Nina had been my best friend from first through fifth grades . We used to dress in matching outfits ; we were cast together , as twin doves , in the third-grade Christmas/Hanukkah play . I had n't seen her since 1967 . <p> " Nina ? " I said . <p> " I ran into her mother at Safeway . She says she 's going gang-busters . Very successful . " <p> " Okay , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and patted my knee . <p> " You know , " Jim Lazarus said the next day , " I 'd really like to get to know you better . " <p> " What you see is what you get , " I said . <p> He leaned over my desk , so that his tie  --  dark red and dark blue stripes , too shiny  --  flopped down . " No , " he said , blushing a little . " I mean , out of the office . " <p> " Out of the office ? . " <p> " I mean , " he said , " these things can be awkward . " <p> " What things ? " <p> " Will you have dinner with me some time ? " <p> " No , " I said . Then , when I saw him blush again , this time more deeply , I said , " I 'm sorry . I do n't exactly mean ' no ' in the sense of ' no , never , never even think of it . ' I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not really dating . " <p> " It would n't be a date , " he said . <p> " Sorry , " I said . Then I said : " Really I am . " He looked so pathetic , with his shiny tie , his glasses . Little beads of sweat had popped out on his forehead , and he brushed them away with the back of his hand . <p> When he left , a moment later , I thought about the first time John and I had gone out . We 'd met in Contracts  --  we were in the same study group . So we never really had a date  --  we just kept going out for Chinese . <p> But now it dawned on me  --  really for the first time  --  that even then he 'd been dropping hints . Once he told me about some Eastern religion class he 'd taken in college : he explained how ancient cultures worshipped both the feminine and the masculine within a single person . " What do you think , Emma ? " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as being both male and female ? " <p> I turned back to my work . I was doing some research on recent D.C. circuit rulings on the transfer of trademark rights . My eyes glazed over . I thought about how people change . My oldest sister , who had once worn peasant blouses and had filled our house with talk about the Rights of the People , had married a stockbroker and become a Republican . My fiance , who had once loved me , no longer did . I went downstairs and got a candy bar , and then , even though it was only about two in the afternoon , left . <p> As the day of the young people 's party approached , my mother got busy . She sat at her desk , for my father 's clients and fellow partners , for my three older sisters ' weddings , for our bat mitzvahs . From these lists she culled a new list , which she then wrote onto a fresh piece of paper under the heading " Young People . " I guess it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her wedding-giving plans ; now she had all this excess mother-of-the-bride energy stored up . It made her fidgety . It was all she could do , in fact , not to return my wedding presents for me . She loved bridal registries and tableware departments , and whenever she went shopping she gravitated toward them like a dog to dinner . She could n't get enough of it , could n't stop herself from turning over dishes to see their make , envisioning dinner parties lit by new crystal candlesticks , talking about " good sets " and " everyday sets . " She knew all the best makers of sterling silver , the difference between French-and American-made porcelains , the subtleties of cocktail glasses . <p> After the invitations went out she started to think about other things . She called me at work to ask about the flowers . " What do you prefer ? " she said . " Baskets or glass bowls ? " I told her that it was up to her . When I got home , she announced that she had finally decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . A few days later , she said : " Do you think a cold buffet would work  --  you know , a little poached salmon with dill , that sort of thing  --  or do you think people are more comfortable being served ? " I told her that I did n't think it mattered . <p> " Everything matters , " she said . <p> Finally she told us that she had finalized her plans . My father and I were sitting at the table , eating , and she was standing behind us , waving a salad spoon back and forth like a baton . She said that she was going to do a hot-and-cold buffet , with a lot of salads and pasta , and fish . But she was not going to do hard liquor . " Just beer , wine , and champagne , for spritzers , " she said . " Do n't you think that 'll be nice " <p> I looked at my father , who was looking at the wall . He was probably thinking about work . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked my father . <p> He blinked . Then he said , " What about Scotch ? " <p> " Young people these days do n't drink Scotch , " she said . <p> I had n't always been like that . I had n't always been so reactive , so passive and dependent . I had n't gone along with things my mother wanted me to do , just because she wanted me to do them . I used to make plans  --  big plans : go to Europe ; learn Hebrew ; become editor of the Law Review . My first year of law school , my father and I had sat down and planned my entire career : honor student , Law Review ( he said any position would do , but personally he thought editor or managing editor would be the best match for my skills ) , a ninth-circuit clerkship ( he named two judges in particular whom he admired ) , followed by a Supreme Court clerkship , and then  --  who knew ? A spot in the Solicitor General 's office ? A special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . I was happy : I had just met John , just passed my first set of exams , just gotten a new haircut that made me look a little like Liza Minelli , and I believed him . That 's why I 'd been so amazed when he called me in April to tell me about the job he 'd found for me at Freid and Heller . " You mean Fried in Hell ? " I said . <p> " Herb Freid is an old friend of mine , " he said . <p> The fact is , I was n't the talented one . John was . John understood concepts before they were explained to him . I had to work at it , grinding it out until I had reached some semblance of an argument . And the satisfaction I derived had more to do with the idea of myself as an attorney than from the work itself . So in some ways Fried in Hell suited me . The work was viewed as just that  --  work , with no deep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . People got rich there , but they did n't get famous . Unlike my father 's office , which was crammed with photographs of himself with important people , the offices of the partners at Freid and Heller were decorated with tasteful prints depicting city streets or children playing . I had planned to move to L.A.  --  John had landed a teaching job there , and , naturally , I was going to follow . But when , in April , my marriage was canceled , I called the firm where I 'd gotten a job and told them that I would n't be joining them . " Gee , that 's too bad , " the hiring partner said . " Well , have a nice day . " And now I did n't know where to go . My mother thought I should take some time off , maybe go visit my older sisters . My father thought I should stay in Washington . " You do n't know it yet , " he said . " But you 're just like your old man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bones , " he said . <p> On the afternoon of the young people 's party my mother presented me with a new dress . " I saw it at Saks and could n't resist , " she said . It was a purple , sleeveless shift , like something Jackie Kennedy would wear . " Thanks , " I said . My mother had in fact had one just like it about twenty years earlier ; she 'd worn it to the summer associates ' party that she and Dad gave that July . The purple had made her skin look white as china , and her hair  --  which was pure black  --  had been piled and puffed on top of her head . <p> " It 's to wear tonight , " she now said . <p> I looked at it , on its hanger from Saks , and felt a new wave of depression hit me . My wedding dress  --  my beautiful , beautiful wedding dress was still hanging in my mother 's closet because it could n't be returned . It was white silk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and glowed like pearls . John , who was gentle and sweet and brilliant , and whom I loved as I 'd never loved anyone , was making plans to relocate to Los Angeles without me . The research I was doing on trademark regulations was boring , and I did n't know where to live . <p> " Do n't worry , " my mother said , patting my hand . " Everything will turn out to be just fine . " Around six , the guests started arriving . My old friend Nina , whom I had n't seen since 1967 , showed up with her husband and baby . I did n't recognize her . She was wearing little gold blobs on her ears , and the same kind of sexless dress  --  a smattering of pastel blooms  --  that our third-grade teacher , Mrs. Demavoy , had worn on Parents ' Day . She told me that she was press secretary to some Senator from the Midwest . " I do a lot of traveling , " she said . " What are you up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job at Fried in Hell . <p> By seven , the party was in full swing . People kept coming up to me and introducing themselves . They said things like , " It 's awfully nice of your parents to have us over , " and then , nodding , waited for me to supply the other side of the conversation . My father stood in khakis and a plaid shirt by the kitchen door and drank Scotch . I wanted to go and stand next to him and drink Scotch , too , but my mother would n't let me . She led me around , introducing me to people I 'd already met : to Holly and Brian , to Joshua Blumenthal , to the guy from Boston whose father had been my father 's freshman-year roommate in college . Then she brought me over to the corner of the patio where some old friends of my sisters were sitting . " This is Emma , the baby , " she said . " Can you believe it ? " A little while later , I heard a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emma 's dad . It was so good of you and Mrs. Posner to invite me , " and I turned around and saw Jim Lazarus from Freid and Heller . <p> " Mom , " I said . " What the f  --  ? " <p> I do n't think she heard me , though , because she kept on smiling , and introducing me , and asking people how they were . <p> I felt like I was going to explode . Finally I broke loose , went into the study , poured myself a Scotch , and sat down in my father 's chair . I looked at the bookshelves , at the titles of the books . After a few minutes , I heard footsteps approaching . I turned to greet my father  --  to sob on his shoulder and tell him the whole ugly story . But when the footsteps stopped , it was Jim Lazarus in the doorway . His thinning hair was combed neatly over the bald spot . <p> " Your mother was right . She said you 'd be here , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She 's really very nice , " he said . " Your mother , I mean . " <p> " I hate this , " I said . <p> He came over and sat down in the chair opposite mine . " She said I should come get you . She said I should bring you back outside , to the party . " <p> I did n't say anything . He sighed and said , " So this is where you grew up ? " It was really all too much for me  --  the party , the purple Jackie Kennedy dress , the Chinese lanterns strung across the patio as they had been twenty years ago when my sisters and I got to stay up late and help my mother pass the cheese platter . I began to cry . Jim Lazarus pulled a handkerchief out of his pocket and gave it to me , which made me cry harder . When I was done he asked me why I was so sad . I told him about John , and Eric 's splewy jokes ; I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and about how I 'd spent the last several months in a state of something approaching vegetable life . Then he came over and put his arms around me , and I cried on his shirt . <p> Around eleven , when my mother came into my room to kiss me goodnight , she told me that she thought Jim Lazarus was n't so bad . " I think he 's kind of sweet , " she said . <p> " He 's all right , " I said . <p> " What about the party ? " she said . " Did you like the party ? " <p> I looked at her  --  the black hair now streaked with gray , the pale skin , the stubborn nose . " I think people had a good time , " I said . <p> " Next time I 'll have more fresh fruit , " she said . " People like that kind of thing . " She patted my knee . And then she leaned over and turned off the light . <p> JENNIFER MOSES , whose story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our January 1991 issue , is a writer living in Washington , D.C. <p>
