Chapter One Monday , January 23 I. MY ASSIGNMENT The Management Oversight Committee of our firm , known among the partnership simply as " the Committee , " meets each Monday at 3:00 p.m . Over coffee and chocolate brioche , these three hotshots , the heads of the firm 's litigation , transactional , and regulatory departments , decide what 's what at Gage &; Griswell for another week . Not bad guys really , able lawyers , heady business types looking out for the greatest good for the greatest number at G &G,; but since I came here eighteen years ago the Committee and their austere powers , freely delegated under the partnership agreement , have tended to scare me silly . I 'm forty-nine , a former copper on the street , a big man with a brave front and a good Irish routine , but in the last few years I 've heard many discouraging words from these three . My points have been cut , my office moved to something smaller , my hours and billing described as far too low . Arriving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the worst . " Mack , " said Martin Gold , our managing partner , " Mack , we need your help . Something serious . " He 's a sizable man , Martin , a wrestler at the U. three decades ago , a middleweight with a chest broad as the map of America . He has a dark , shrewd face , a little like those Mongol warriors of Genghis Khan 's , and the venerable look of somebody who 's mixed it up with life . He is , no question , the best lawyer I know . The other two , Carl Pagnucci and Wash Thale , were eating at the walnut conference table , an antique of Continental origin with the big heavy look of a cuckoo clock . Martin invited me to share the brioche , but I took only coffee . With these guys , I needed to be quick . " This is n't about you , " said Carl , making a stark appraisal of my apprehensions . " Who ? " I asked . " Bert , " said Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kamin has not appeared at the office . No mail from him , no calls . In the case of your average baseline human being who has worked at Gage &; Griswell during my time , say anyone from Leotis Griswell to the Polish gal who cleans the cans , this would be cause for concern . Not so clearly Bert . Bert is a kind of temperamental adolescent , big and brooding , who enjoys the combat of the courtroom . You need a lawyer who will cross-examine opposing party 's CEO and claw out his intestines in the fashion of certain large cats , Bert 's your guy . On the other hand , if you want someone who will come to work , fill out his time sheets , or treat his secretary as if he recollected that slavery is dead , then you might think about somebody else . After a month or two on trial , Bert is liable to take an absolute powder . Once he turned up at the fantasy camp run by the Trappers , our major league baseball team . Another time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moods , scowls , and hallway tantrums , his macho stunts and episodic schedule , Bert has survived at Gage &; Griswell largely through the sufferance of Martin , who is a champion of tolerance and seems to enjoy the odd ducks like Bert . Or , for that matter , me . " Why do n't you talk to those thugs down at the steam bath where he likes to hang out ? Maybe they know where he is . " I meant the Russian Bath . Unmarried , Bert is apt to follow the Kindle County sporting teams around the country on weekends , laying heavy bets and passing time in sports bars or places like the Bath where people talk about the players with an intimacy they do n't presume with their relations . " He 'll show up , " I added , " he always does . " Pagnucei said simply , " Not this time . " " This is very sensitive , " Wash Thale told me . " Very sensitive . " Wash tends to state the obvious in a grave , portentous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a look . " Martin shot a brown expandable folder across the glimmer of the table . A test , I feared at once , and felt a bolt of anxiety quicken my thorax , but inside all I found were eighteen checks . They were drawn on what we call the 397 Settlement Account , an escrow administered by G &G; which contains $288 million scheduled to be paid out shortly to various plaintiffs in settlement of a massive air crash case brought against Trans-National Air . TN , the world 's biggest airline and travel concern , is G &G's; largest client . We stand up for TN in court ; we help TN buy and deal and borrow . With its worldwide hotels and resorts , its national catering business , its golf courses , airport parking lots , and rent-a-car subsidiaries , TN lays claim to some part of the time of almost every lawyer around here . We live with the company like family in the same home , tenanted on four floors of the TN Needle , just below the world corporate headquarters . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in his flourishing maniac hand , each one cut to something called Litiplex Ltd. , in an amount of several hundred thousand dollars . On the memo lines of the drafts Bert had written " Litigation Support . " Document analyses , computer models , expert witnesses - the engineers run amok in air crash cases . " What 's Litiplex ? " I asked . Martin , to my amazement , rifled a finger as if I 'd said something adroit . " Not incorporated or authorized to do business in any of the fifty states , " he said . " Not in any state 's Assumed Names registry . Carl checked . " Nodding , Carl added like an omen , " Myself . " Carl Pagnucci - born Carlo - is forty-two , the youngest of three , and stingy with words , a lawyer 's lawyer who holds his own speech in the same kind of suspicion with which Woody Hayes viewed the forward pass . He is a pale little guy with a mustache like one of those round brushes that comes with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasteful , with a flash of gold from his cufflinks , he reveals nothing . Assessing the news that Bert , my screwball colleague , had written millions of dollars of checks to a company that did n't exist , I felt some peculiar impulse to defend him , my own longtime alliance with the wayward . " Maybe somebody asked him to do it , " I said . " That 's where we started , " Wash replied . He 'd taken his stout figure back to the brioche . This had come up initially , Wash said , when Glyndora Gaines , our staff supervisor in Accounting , noticed these large disbursements with no backup . " Glyndora 's searched three times for any paper trail , " Wash told me . " Invoices . Sign-of memo from Jake . " Under our procedures , Bert was allowed to write checks on the 397 account only after receiving written approval from Jake Eiger , a former partner in this firm , who is now the General Counsel at TN . " And ? " " There is none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her counterparts at TN , the folks who handle the accounting on 397 . Nothing to alarm them . You understand . ' We had some stray correspondence for this Litiplex . Blah , blah , blah . ' Martin tried the same approach with one or two of the plaintiffs ' lawyers in the hope they knew something we did n't . There 's nothing , " he said , " not a scrap . Nobody 's ever heard the name . " Wash is more shifty than smart , but looking at him - his liver spots and wattles , his discreet twitches and the little bit of mouse gray hair he insists on pasting across his scalp - I detected the feckless expression he has when he is sincere . " Not to mention , " he added , " the endorsement . " I 'd missed that . Now I took note on the back of each check of the bilingual green block stamp of the International Bank of Finance in Pico Luan . Pico , a tiny Central American nation , a hangnail on the toe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars and absolute bank secrecy . There were no signatures on the checks ' backs , but what I took for the account number was inscribed on each beneath the stamp . A straight deposit . " We tried calling the bank , " said Martin . " I explained to the General Manager that we were merely trying to confirm that Robert Kamin had rights of deposit and withdrawal on account 476642. 1 received a very genial lecture on the bank secrecy laws in Pico in reply . Quite a clever fellow , this one . With that beautiful accent . just the piece of work you 'd expect in that business . Like trying to grab hold of smoke . I asked if he was familiar with Mr. Kamin 's name . Not a word I could quote , but I thought he was saying yes . God knows , he did n't say no . " " And what 's the total ? " I thumbed the checks . " Over five and a half million , " said Carl , who was always quickest with figures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With that , we were all briefly silent , awed by the gravity of the number and the daring of the feat . My partners writhed in further anguish , but on closer inspection of myself I found I was vibrating like a bell that had been struck . What a notion ! Grabbing all that dough and hieing out for parts unknown . The wealth , the freedom , the chance to start anew ! I was n't sure if I was more shocked or thrilled . " Has anybody talked to Jake ? " That seemed like the next logical step to me , tell the client they 'd been had . " God , no , " said Wash . " There 's going to be hell to pay with TN . A partner in the firm lies to them , embezzles , steals . That 's just the kind of thing that Krzysinski has been waiting for to leverage Jake . We will be dead . Dead , " he said .
