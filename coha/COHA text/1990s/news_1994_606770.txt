<p> Two weeks after the Clinton administration initiative to guarantee immunizations for all children was supposed to start , no elements of the ambitious new program are in place in the District , Maryland or Virginia . <p> Even though the " Vaccines for Children " program was signed into law a year ago , no vaccine has arrived in doctors ' offices locally , or in half the states . Neither federal officials nor those in 24 states have worked out a system for shipping the vaccines to tens of thousands of physicians . And throughout the Washington area , the networks of doctors willing to administer the vaccines do not yet exist . <p> In February 1993 , the immunization program was the first attempt by the fledgling Clinton administration to broaden the federal government 's role in health care through a promise of free shots for every child . <p> By the time it went into effect this month , the idea  --  now vastly pared down to focus primarily on children who are poor and uninsured  --  had become an illustration of the federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation 's health care system . <p> Nearly everyone who has had anything to do with the initiative has a different explanation for its slow start . <p> * The administration 's initial $ 1 billion plan was too broad and ill-conceived , according to Sen. Dale Bumpers ( D-Ark. ) and other members of Congress . Some members complained that the president 's initial proposal called for spending federal money to vaccinate children whose families had good health insurance or could afford to pay for shots . <p> * More fundamentally , some in Congress and in the medical community questioned whether the program would work . They contended that the real problem was not the cost or supply of vaccine  --  which always has been available without charge in public clinics  --  but the failure of some parents to take their children to get shots . <p> * Drug manufacturers resisted the idea out of financial concerns , arguing they would have to sell virtually all their vaccines to the government at a discount . Pamela R. Adkins , a Merck &; Co. spokesman , said the large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government at a 50 percent discount , offsetting that discount through its prices in the private sector . <p> * Once the program was passed , the General Accounting Office questioned the administration 's plan for getting vaccines to doctors  --  a central warehouse in New Jersey to be run by the General Services Administration . <p> * And some doctors complain that , as Congress cut back the scope of the plan , it made it more cumbersome and complex . Participating physicians , for example , now would have to keep the vaccine they receive from the program refrigerated separately from the vaccine administered to other patients . <p> According to some doctors and state and local health officials , the program 's start-up delays have damaged its chance of success . " The credibility is hurt , " said James Farrell , director of the Virginia Health Department 's immunization bureau . At the behest of the federal government , " We 've gone and sold this thing . Now we look like we 're floundering , " Farrell said . <p> Donna E. Shalala , secretary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Quite frankly , we are not as far along as we 'd like to be at this point . We are going to keep working until it is fully operational nationwide . " <p> The program 's start-up difficulties are particularly striking because , unlike national health reform  --  which died this year after 21 months of controversy  --  virtually everyone agrees that children should be immunized . <p> Immunization protects children from polio , whooping cough , measles and other diseases that afflicted earlier generations . It is one of few preventive health strategies proven to be cost-saving . Even so , one-third of U.S. children have not received the traditional shots recommended by age 2 , including as many as 70 percent of children in some poor , urban neighborhoods , according to federal figures . <p> Free immunizations have long been available at public clinics . The Clinton administration 's idea was to enlist private doctors and create a central , federal purchasing system for the vaccines given to all American children . <p> The rationale was that private doctors have had to buy vaccine at much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , according to Sara Rosenbaum , professor of health policy at George Washington University 's Center for Health Policy Research , who helped the White House design the program . <p> As a result , doctors have charged as much as $ 50 to $ 60 per vaccination , including their fees , and told parents who could not pay to use a public clinic . Often , families did n't go , or clinics were too crowded to handle them , so children were not properly immunized , Rosenbaum said . <p> Monica DeWalt 's family in Northeast Washington is an example . Her twins got their first three rounds of shots from their pediatrician , and she got a $ 700 bill . Because their insurance did n't cover vaccinations , she spent months scraping together installment payments . So when Michael and Marlon needed their next vaccinations , DeWalt went to the District 's Frank D. Reeves Municipal Center for free shots . She herded the toddlers and her two young daughters onto a bus , then waited three hours in a big room filled with crying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said DeWalt , 37 , who works for a temporary agency . " But they must have been real behind . They got a lot of shots . " <p> The Clinton administration 's original proposal would have meant that children such as DeWalt 's would not have left their doctor without proper shots . It would have reached out to all families by making free vaccinations available to doctors and limiting physicians ' fees for administering them . <p> Under the version of the bill that Congress passed , children who are uninsured , eligible for Medicaid , or American Indian or Alaskan natives may get free vaccines from doctors who agree to participate in the program . Their parents could be charged only an administration fee  --  $ 14 to $ 16 in the Washington area . <p> But children with insurance that does not cover immunization , such as the DeWalts , can get free vaccines only at certain clinics . <p> To get the vaccine to doctors , the Department of Health and Human Services proposed the warehouse in New Jersey , run by the General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after GAO and some in Congress contended that the GSA was unprepared for such an operation . <p> The government gave the states a choice of relying on the warehouse or distributing the vaccines themselves . <p> Half the states decided to implement the program . Health officials in the District , Maryland and Virginia chose to wait for federal officials . <p> In Virginia , for example , the state health department runs a small pharmacy in the basement of a state office building in Richmond . A pharmacist and a few workers send vaccine to 150 local health department clinics . But the pharmacy does n't have enough staff or space for the refrigerators and foam coolers to store and ship vaccine to the more than the 1,000 doctors statewide predicted to take part in the new program , according to Farrell , of the state health department . <p> Similarly , Martin Levy , chief of the District Public Health Commission 's bureau of epidemiology and disease control , said " it would n't be too wise " for the city to try to create its own vaccine-shipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtually impossible to hire new workers , and city contracts are slow . " We would never get it done , " Levy said . <p> Maryland officials also decided it would be cheaper and easier to rely on the federal system . <p> The federal government , meanwhile , had abandoned the warehouse idea and decided to have manufacturers ship vaccines to doctors ' offices . It 's not clear when those shipments will begin . Nor is it certain how many physicians will participate . <p> In addition to separating the program 's vaccines , separate records must be kept for federal audits . <p> " Who is going to sit there and keep up with all this paperwork for the government ? You can forget it , " said Theresa Charles , who manages offices in Forestville and the District for her husband , pediatrician Lloyd Charles , who treats the DeWalt children . " I 'm all for children having shots . But they just do n't realize how much they are putting the burden on the doctors ' offices , especially when free vaccine already is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether they will be able collect the modest fee they can charge for handling and administering the vaccines . Under the rules , if parents say they can not afford the fee , the doctor can not refuse to vaccinate . <p> More fundamentally , physicians question whether the program will work , noting that recent immunization drives in the area have had limited success . As part of a recent , ward-by-ward immunization campaign in the District , said Muriel Wolf , president of the District chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics , " I went to a Safeway parking lot and sat in a van . Not many kids came out . " <p> " There has been free vaccine available for years , and the mothers do n't go , " said Prince William County pediatrician John W. Mitchell , president of the Virginia Pediatric Society . <p> But Monica DeWalt , with four children and a low-wage job , would like her children to be immunized at her pediatrician 's  --  something the existing program denies because Dewalt has some private insurance . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the doctor , " she said . " If I could get it right there , it would be good . "
