After the 1988 election , in a rage at George Bush 's conduct , I was particularly susceptible to liberalish junk mail . What I hungered for was a group called something like Patriotic Americans for Flag Burning and Prison Furloughs . What I settled for was the likes of the American Civil Liberties Union , Handgun Control Inc. and my local public-television station . In the past few months , they have all been hitting me up for renewal . What 's more , they have generously shared my name and address with other groups willing to gamble that a tender concern for the First Amendment or a fondness for British soap operas will tend to accompany a sympathy for elephants and dolphins or a passion to deny a raise to members of Congress . <P> Now , despite my best efforts to stoke them , the fires of rage have cooled . Was Roger Ailes the prisoner and Willie Horton the political strategist or the other way around ? And what does it all have to do with starvation in Ethiopia , anyway ? Yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heart that bleeds only sporadically and selectively is worse than a heart that does n't bleed at all . <P> Here 's why . Suppose Patriotic Americans for Flag Burning , etc. , actually exists and sends you an invitation to join up for $25 . The " package " will be full of goodies : a letter , a reply envelope , a card ( too big for the envelope , with a pointless perforation so that half of it can be torn off and thrown away ) , a brochure and perhaps a little Taiwanese-made American flag to burn in the privacy of your home . Why all this stuff ? Because you demand it . While trying to appeal to you with flattery for your intelligence and compassion , direct-mail packages are designed on the assumption that you 're a self- indulgent idiot . Even environmental groups destroy thousands of extra trees , sating their members ' hunger for superfluous paper . <P> As a result , even an inexpensive package will cost 10 cents to produce . Buying your name from Citizens for Massive Federal Subsidies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might cost Americans for Flag Burning another 6 cents , and mailing the package at bulk rate will be about a dime . Total : 26 cents . But if one person out of 100 responds to the package , that 's considered an adequate return . So it 's cost them $26 to extract your $25 . Unless you send more , they 're out a buck . Of course , the money spent finding you is lost whether you respond or not . But that 's just the beginning . After waiting a decent interval  --  though considerably short of the year you thought you signed up for  --  they will begin trying to renew you . ( When I did my taxes last year , I discovered I 'd paid my annual public-television dues three times . ) Renewal notices do n't require buying the name ( they own you already ) and tend to be thinner on party favors , but they usually are personalized , which is expensive . They might cost 40 cents each . And it would not be unusual to send out ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's four bucks .
