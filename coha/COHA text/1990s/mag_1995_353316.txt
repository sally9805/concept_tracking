True , Timothy McVeigh did n't hold a steady job , but he never seemed to want for money . In the days leading to the Oklahoma bombing , he paid cash for his motel room in Junction City , Kansas ; he paid cash for the Ryder truck that allegedly carried some 5,000 lbs . of explosives to Oklahoma ; and he forked over $250 ( and his old Pontiac ) for the Mercury he was driving when he was arrested . In Kingman , Arizona , the owner of the trailer park where the suspect lived in 1993 says he saw McVeigh flashing around " a big wad of money . " Investigators have told Time that McVeigh possesses some $10,000 in cash and bank accounts . The money , along with the precision and power of the explosion , are leading the feds to believe that McVeigh and his missing accomplice  --  still known only as John Doe No. 2  --  were far from lone bombers . Instead the feds suspect the men were members of some sort of organized extremist group that provided them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law-enforcement officials , could not have masterminded the plot alone . " He 's not smart enough to have thought it would come out the way it did , " one investigator told TIME . <P> For now , however , he is dedicated enough to his comrades and their cause to keep his mouth shut . Imprisoned at the El Reno Federal Correctional Institution in Oklahoma , McVeigh , when questioned , responds only with his name , his rank and his date of birth-obeying , as it happens , the instructions for pows in a manual published by the Michigan Militia . Even when confronted last week with photographs of the children carried from the crumpled Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building  --  some bloody and numb with shock , others already dead  --  McVeigh appeared unshaken . The accused bomber seems to have decided that he is a prisoner of war . <P> The criminal investigation into the Oklahoma City bombing may be proceeding without the cooperation of McVeigh , but it continues to lead to him . Last week U.S. magistrate Ronald Howland denied him bail and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crime . Eyewitnesses place him near the scene of the bombing before the 9:02 a.m. blast on April 19 . An fbi agent has testified that McVeigh 's clothing tested positive for traces of explosive materials . With McVeigh in custody , the most urgent question facing federal agents is where else  --  and to whom  --  that trail leads . John Doe No. 2 remains missing , and may have left the scene of the bombing in a car with Arizona license plate No . LZC646-a number originally assigned to McVeigh . <P> The search for clues now runs from Kansas to Michigan to Arizona to Wisconsin to California . One possible new angle is that the bombing was financed by a series of unsolved bank robberies throughout the Midwest ; in some of these incidents pipe bombs were left at the scene . Other investigators have turned to Paulsen 's Military Supply in Antigo , Wisconsin . When McVeigh was arrested in Perry , Oklahoma , he left the store 's business card in the patrol car . The father-son Paulsens are gun traders and may deal in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most important , the authorities are pursuing a theory that the plot was hatched by McVeigh and some former Army buddies from the First Infantry Division at Fort Riley , Kansas , where both McVeigh and Terry Nichols served . Nichols and his brother James remain in custody as material witnesses .
