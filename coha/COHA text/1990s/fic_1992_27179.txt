On the Outer Banks of North Carolina there is a legend about the ships that have come to grief in the great autumn storms off those hungry shoals . Over the centuries there have been many ; the Banks have more than earned their reputation as the Graveyard of the Atlantic . Most of the graves are in Diamond Shoals , just off the point of Cape Hatteras , but the entire hundred-odd-mile sweep of coast has devoured its measure of wood and flesh . Myths and spectres and apparitions he as thick as sea fog over the Banks , but the one that I have always remembered is the one Ginger Fowler told us all ... Cecie , Fig , Paul Sibley , and me ... the September of my last year in college , when we were visiting her between quarters . " They say that whenever a ship is going to go down you can hear something like singing in the wind , " she said . " Bankers say it 's mermaids , calling the sailors . Lots of them claim to have heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They say when you hear it , you have no choice but to follow it , and you end up on the shoals . A few of the sailors who 've been rescued swear to it . " We were sitting on the front veranda of the Fowlers ' house on the dunes on Nag 's Head beach , watching the twilight die over the Atlantic . On either side of us hulked the great , black-weathered , two- and three-story cottages that made up what the Bankers call the Unpainted Aristocracy  --  along line of huge , weather-stained wooden summer houses that had been built in the early days of the century by the very rich . When they were first built , the houses reigned alone on that lordly line of dunes , owning by sheer forcemajeure the wild , empty beach . Now they are surrounded by flealike armies of bungalows and time-shares and fishing piers and umbrella and float rentals , like mastodons beset by pygmies . But even now , when you are on the front porches or verandas , you have no sense of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wind and sun and emptiness , and the endless sea . I remember that I felt a small frisson that might have been night wind on sunburned flesh , and reached for Paul 's hand . He squeezed it , but did not turn to look at me . He was looking intently at Ginger 's sweet , snub face , stained red by the sun setting behind us over Roanoke Sound and by the long , golden days in the sun . Autumn on the Outer Banks is purely a sorcerer 's spell : so clear you can see each grain of sand on the great dunes , and bathed in a light that is indescribable . We had stayed on the beach from dawn to sunset for the past four days , and all of us wore the stigmata on our cheeks and shoulders . But Ginger was the red-brown of cast bronze all over . The freckles on her broad cheekbones had merged in a copper mask , and her eyelashes and tow head had whitened . She looked like a piece of Mayan statuary in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and abundant and solid as the earth . I thought she looked almost perfectly a piece of the old house and the older coast , but in fact her father had only bought the house two summers before , from an imperious old widow who was going , most reluctantly , to live with her children in Wilmington . Before that Ginger had summered at Gulf Shores , on the Alabama coast , and lived with her family in a small north Alabama town called , appropriately , Fowler . It consisted of a huge textile mill , a mill village and store , and little else , all of which belonged to Ginger 's father . The Fowlers ; were newly , enormously , and to us , almost inconceivably rich . Ginger worked very hard to conceal the fact , and succeeded so well that until we went to visit her on the Outer Banks , and saw the house , we did not really comprehend it . Fig had told us when she proposed Ginger for sisterhood in Tri Omega that Ginger had a trust fund of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a breathtaking sum of money . But since none of us paid much attention to what Fig said , we either forgot it or discounted it . In the end , Ginger became a Tri Omega because we all loved her . It was impossible not to . She was as gregarious , sweet-natured , and simple as a golden retriever . " And , " Cecie observed thoughtfully , " looks not unlike one . " On the darkening porch that night at Nag 's Head , Paul smiled at Ginger and said , " Have you heard the mermaids singing , Ginger ? " and the little cold breath on my nape and shoulders strengthened . " God , no , " she said . " It would scare the bejesus out of me . I hope I never do . " " I wish I could , " he said , and then he did look at me , and squeezed my hand again . " That would be something to hear . I think that would be worth just about anything . " I actually shivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around us had weight and meaning , and every , whirling atom had particularity and portent . But I was so much in love with him by then that everything he said , everything we did , everything that surrounded us , our entire context , had resonance and purpose . Cecie looked at me and then at Paul , and said , " I think I 'll go make some tea , " and rose and padded into the house . I watched her out of sight , thinking once more how like a small , slender boy she looked in silhouette , wishing that she liked Paul better .
