Heather was wearing the wrong dress . It had seemed like a good idea in the morning -- it was a tight little black thing ; she 'd looked fantastic in the mirror -- but now she was thinking that she should have worn something demure . This was a foolish dress to meet your intellectual hero in . Waiting in the coffee shop for the great man to arrive , Heather was squirming with nervousness , and she began to wonder why she was here -- why she had gone to such lengths to meet this man , when she knew he could n't possibly be as interesting in person as he was in his books . She had a wild urge to flee -- to scribble a note of apology , leave it with the waiter , and drive all the way back to Providence . But she stayed where she was . She was nervous ; she was a little scared ; but she could live with that . Fear of any undertaking , to her way of thinking , was usually a reason to go ahead with it . The door opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wearing an enormous coat -- a coat that was like a house -- and a big , furry , many-flapped hat . He peeled off the hat and stopped for a moment in front of the cash register , stamping off the snow . He was wearing galoshes . They had never met , but he picked her out instantly , and he came toward her , smiling . Old , fat , bald , leaning awkwardly on a cane . The man of her dreams . CHAPTER TWO I ca n't believe it 's you , " she said , as he pressed her hand and sat heavily across from her . What she wanted to say was : You 've been dear to me since I was a girl . You were one of my life-teachers . You understood me ; you helped me understand myself . If reading a book is a naked encounter between two people , I have known you nakedly for years . She wanted to say wild things to him , but here he was , struggling out of his coat , and he seemed terribly old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she suddenly felt shy . When she read his work , it was as if he poured his soul directly into hers , and they mixed . Now there were bodies in the way . She felt as if she were in the middle of an earthquake . The furniture in her mind was sliding around . Reading his work , she had always thought of him as a contemporary . In fact -- as she 'd known , of course , with her rational mind -- he was closer to her grandparents ' age . And though she 'd entertained many imaginary pictures of him over the years , it had never occurred to her that he might be fat . To her mind , genius was gaunt . He was older and larger than she 'd imagined , and somehow both softer and harder . His hand was soft when she shook it ; his face was saggy , like a poached egg . In his eyes , though , there was something chilly and ironic . He was an odd combination of the soft and the shrewd . He looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's me either , " Schiller said -- breathing heavily , looking for a place to rest his cane . CHAPTER THREE Heather ordered a salad , a BLT , and coffee ; Schiller asked for a baked potato -- no butter , no sour cream -- and tea . " I 'm on the Pritikin diet , " he said to her after the waiter left . " I had a heart attack last year , and the year before that . I 'm not allowed to put butter on anything anymore . " " That must have been very scary , " she said , trying to sound like the most sympathetic woman ever born . " They do tend to concentrate the mind . " This was a literary reference , but she could n't remember from where . Her mind was reeling . She was sitting across from him ! He was here ! He was here , but he was dying . She felt thankful that she had come to him in time . The waiter returned with her salad , his potato , her coffee and his tea , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself down to earth . " Are you working on a new novel ? " she said . " I 'm working on a novel , yes . But I 've been working on it so long I 'm not sure you could call it new . " He sipped his tea , with , she thought , a notable delicacy . Remember the way he drinks his tea . Remember the softness of his hands . Remember the way he looks down at the table when he speaks . Remember . He asked her a few questions about herself : where she was born , where she 'd gone to school , whether she liked New York . It struck her as odd that she should have to tell him these things . Did n't he know her ? During the years she 'd been reading his work , he had so often helped her understand herself that she 'd sometimes felt as if he cared about her . " So , " he said finally , " you 've embarked on a project of questionable merit . You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his big head sadly . This was why she was here . This was why she had worked up the courage to find him , and this was why she had come to New York . She was writing her master 's thesis about Schiller 's novels . The thesis , in her mind , was only the first step : her real goal was to write a book about his work . She was twenty-four years old ; she hoped to have her thesis written before her twenty-fifth birthday and a book contract in her hands before her twenty-sixth . She had grandiose daydreams . Schiller had written four novels , and all of them were out of print . In the 1940s , when most of William Faulkner 's work was out of print , the critic Malcolm Cowley reintroduced him to the public with a volume called The Portable Faulkner . It was this collection that made American readers see they had a genius in their midst ; if not for Cowley , Faulkner might have died in obscurity . Heather was already thinking about a Portable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project , " she said , lamely . He took off his glasses and polished them slowly with a handkerchief " I m flattered by your interest . And if you 're intent on doing this study , I wo n't try to talk you out of it . But I 'm sorry to have to say that I wo n't be able to help you with it either . " She tried to take this in . He had n't been encouraging on the phone , but neither had he told her flatly that he would n't help . " Why ? " " Ten years ago , it would have made me very happy . But I 'm an old man now . " " What does being old have to do with it ? " " I 'm trying to finish a novel , " he said . " It will probably be the last novel I write . My only remaining goal in life is to finish it . I 'm not in good health , and I need to avoid anything that distracts me from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wolfe . A very flattering distraction , but a distraction nonetheless . " He sighed . It struck her as a poetic sigh , but she was prepared to find poetry in anything he did . She looked at him closely . The folds of skin on his face sagged disastrously ; like many old men , he looked strangely like an old woman . In a way , what he 'd said was what she would have wanted him to say . She thought his devotion to his art was beautiful . He was a hero : a wounded hero , dragging his frail body toward his goal . " I understand . And I respect your decision . But I ca n't help thinking that you 've made up your mind too quickly . Maybe the best thing for your health would be to have a fascinating young women in your life . " He 'd been about to put his glasses back on , but now he put them down and examined her , with an expression of curiosity and amusement . It was as if he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't look away . It occurred to her that the eyes do n't really age . These were the eyes that his friends and lovers had looked into when he was young . With no attempt to hide her scrutiny , she studied his face . What she saw there , what she thought she saw , was strength , pain , loneliness , bitterness , and the struggle against bitterness . And , of course , time . In the slackness of his skin , in his fallen , half-womanly face , she saw the way time breaks the body down . For a moment the stare felt like a sexualized encounter . By the time Schiller looked away , she felt as if they had passed beyond sex . She did n't know what she meant by that , but that was how it felt . " Give me a chance , damn it . You 'll be happy you got to know me . " She wanted to take things further ; she wanted to say something she might regret . She knew what she wanted to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . But whenever Heather felt uncertain about whether to do something , she did it . She had decided long ago that you never learn anything by holding back . " Maybe , " she said , " you 'll even fall in love with me . " " You 're an odd young woman , " he murmured , with a look of prim disapproval . He was blushing . She had never seen an old man blush .
