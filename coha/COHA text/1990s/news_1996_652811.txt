<p> PAUL TAYLOR , THE EMINENT American choreographer , appropriately lives in a house that is eminently American . It is a landmark brownstone in lower Manhattan , and it is not the sort of place where one would find a television in the drawing room . Indeed , the drawing room , with its venerable furniture , carpets and artwork , is not the sort of place in which it feels natural even to mention television . <p> But Mr. Taylor is an amiable , soft-spoken gentleman . Just as he was persuaded in the late 1970 's to let his dances be presented on WNET 's " Dance in America " series , he agreed one morning not long ago to describe how his attitude toward the camera has tipped in recent years from distrust to guarded fascination . <p> The occasion was the making of " The Wrecker 's Ball : Three Dances by Paul Taylor , " which was filmed in March inside an old school on the Lower East Side and will be shown by PBS on Wednesday night at 10 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocence from the 1940 's through the 60 's , is the sixth " Dance in America " special to feature Mr. Taylor 's company . More important , it is the second created by a team of virtuosos intent on using Mr. Taylor 's work to find more imaginative ways to wed two very different mediums . Their first effort , " Speaking in Tongues , " won an Emmy Award in 1992 . <p> " I do n't think of myself as a team person ; I never have , " said the 66-year-old Mr. Taylor , who danced prominently with Martha Graham for six years before breaking away in the late 50 's to run his own troupe . " I 'm a dictator , actually . I think all choreographers have to be , being in the position of telling people what to do and preventing them from straying . But these are people I 've known for a long time and trust . I found that , suddenly , being a team player was a whole new wonderful experience . " <p> The " Wrecker 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was once a dancer and choreographer himself ; the legendary designer Santo Loquasto ; the lighting designer Alan Adelman ; the film editor Girish Bhargava , and the producer Judy Kinberg , who came to WNET in New York from CBS to help her mentors , Merrill Brockway and Emile Ardolino , start " Dance in America " 20 years ago . Largely because of his rapport with Mr. Ardolino and then Ms. Kinberg , Mr. Taylor agreed in the 70 's and 80 's to have his company be televised performing many of his most acclaimed works  --  including " Esplanade , " " Aureole " and " Last Look "  --  in a traditional way , onstage as if in front of an audience . But he never felt comfortable with the way the dances looked on the screen . <p> " It still to my eye does not look like live movement , " Mr. Taylor explained . " It looks flat and little . For the camera , if you stay on a long shot too long , the dancers ' figures are so small that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding ways to get closer . " <p> When Mr. Diamond and Ms. Kinberg set about planning to film " Speaking in Tongues , " a dance about small-town passions and spiritual conflict , they realized that the way to get closer was to leave the stage altogether and work on location , so the camera could follow the dancers as if they were actors . " The moment you commit yourself to dance being in the screen , so much changes , " Mr. Diamond said recently from Los Angeles , where he directs network sitcoms and dramas . " What you do get is an extraordinary number of angles and points of focus and , if you take it , the opportunity to look at it from any point of view , not just the proscenium : above , below , from one dancer to another , to an individual dancer coming straight at you . " <p> IT TURNED OUT TO BE TOO expensive to make " Speaking in Tongues " on location , but the program was filmed on a Nashville sound stage that was large enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mr. Diamond and Ms. Kinberg to explore some of their ideas about dramatizing with " a camera that has real attitude , " as Ms. Kinberg puts it . For his part , although the " Dance in America " producers had always listened closely to him , Mr. Taylor finally felt creative kinship . <p> " The TV people in the old days seemed to think that you always had to keep it clear about where in space the dancer was , " the choreographer said . " I was so relieved to find out Matthew believed that in dance , that kind of logic is n't necessary . " <p> As soon as the filming of " Speaking in Tongues " was completed , all involved knew that in spite of the discouraging financial situation faced by public television , they wanted to go further in breaking the barriers between camera and dancer . Five years later , after Mr. Taylor created " Company B " ( set to wartime songs of the Andrews Sisters ) , " A Field of Grass " ( to Harry Nilsson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ditties from the 50 's like " Alley Oop ! " ) , they saw a way to do so . <p> " The Wrecker 's Ball " groups these three dances made in the 90 's into a narrative about the bright and dark sides of the American dream in the 40 's , 50 's and 60 's . Mr. Taylor insists that although the dances share themes , he did not intend them as a trilogy . And they have not been performed on stage in that way . ( Ms. Kinberg says Mr. Taylor is " naive like a fox . " ) <p> In any case , as soon as all three dances had been presented by Mr. Taylor 's company , Ms. Kinberg , Mr. Diamond and Mr. Loquasto saw the opportunity for a new sort of dance broadcast . And Mr. Diamond and Mr. Loquasto conceived of an approach whereby a location could be a unifying factor . The place , a U.S.O. dance hall during World War II , would be renovated into a movie theater in the 50 's and then deteriorate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before being demolished by the wrecker 's ball of the title . As the location evolved , the dancers would transform from soldiers and bobby-soxers to hepcats and then hippies . <p> " I sat down with Paul for an hour or two and said , ' Here 's what I intend to do , ' " recalled Mr. Diamond . " Afterward , he gave me the highest compliment I 've ever been paid . He said , ' You understand the dance behind the dance . ' I think that operating with that in mind , he gave me the freedom to go ahead with the collaboration . " <p> One day last March , inside the Connelly Center for Education , a Roman Catholic school on East Fourth Street , this freedom was in full display . The school 's theater , an antiquated circular space with iron arches holding up a balcony , had been equipped with vintage 50 's theater seats that could be readily removed . Mary Cochran and Lisa Viola , dressed in striking black-and-white jump suits , practiced a peekaboo portion of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ornate columns in the wings of the stage , to " Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini . " <p> Yellow filters on spotlights in the balcony gave everything a gilded glow ; fake smoke filled the air , increasing a sense of the bygone . Technicians scurried up and down the stairs to the right wing , where a cameraman was stationed in close quarters . On stage with the dancers , Mr. Diamond in a cheery , musical voice , offered suggestions about movements and reminders about camera placement . Off to the theater 's left side , Mr. Taylor sat , smoking , in front of a stand that held three monitors . After watching them intently for a minute , he turned , smiled and said in his soothingly hoarse voice , " I have enough trouble with plain old right and left . " <p> Minutes later he rose , walked up to the stage and said firmly : " This would be a good time to jump up in the air . But remember to keep your spacing . " <p> Each sequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director , so the adjustments required of the dancers were myriad . " One of the big differences , " said Mr. Taylor , " is that with a stage performance , you start and go through to the end . Nothing is supposed to stop you . In television like this , you usually do n't shoot in sequence , and it 's usually done in bits . The dancers ' sense of building as they go along  --  they ca n't have that . " <p> The dancer Patrick Corbin said later that he , like virtually everyone else in the company , enjoyed filming " The Wrecker 's Ball " and that Mr. Taylor and Mr. Diamond were always attentive to the dancers ' concerns but that the frustrations were many . " You 're always trying to just dance it , " he said , " but there was one point in ' A Field of Grass , ' for example , where I was doing this turning stuff , and Paul wanted me to look straight at the roof . And I was dodging a cameraman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was very effective , but at that moment it was not about dancing ; it was about not hitting the camera . " <p> After practice takes of " Yellow Polka Dot Bikini , " Mr. Diamond and Mr. Taylor conferred . Then , as Mr. Taylor sat down and put on a headset , Mr. Diamond raced backstage and out a door to a courtyard , where a trailer sat . Inside it , a sound engineer perched in a cubbyhole , watching his controls . Down a passage , Ms. Kinberg sat with her assistants facing a wall of monitors , keeping track of every shot , every angle . Mr. Diamond took his place , put on a headset and said : " O.K. , gang . We 're rolling . Get tense . " <p> Weeks later , in early May , things were anything but tense in an editing studio on West 38th Street as Ms. Kinberg and Mr. Diamond showed Mr. Taylor a rough cut of " The Wrecker 's Ball . " The three sat in plush chairs , bowls of popcorn at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of them , at a computer on which he could call up alternative takes with a few keystrokes . <p> " Mr. Taylor is making trouble , " announced Mr. Taylor , who was , indeed , objecting in his gentle way to a 35-second cut that Ms. Kinberg and Mr. Diamond had decided upon . The choreographer wanted to see if other options existed , and the next hour , like the dinner time of a happy family , was filled with a melange of technical proposals , one-liners and philosophical speculation about time . <p> " LET 'S CUT THE SPONSOR 'S advertising , " joked Mr. Taylor . Ms. Kinberg countered , " There is no advertising . " <p> Despite the disagreement , everybody was clearly pleased with what they were viewing . " The Wrecker 's Ball " was something new , and a difference over 35 seconds was n't going to reverse that ; in a couple of days , Mr. Diamond would fly home , Mr. Taylor would go into his own studio to rehearse a new dance , and Ms. Kinberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home in his brownstone a few weeks later , Mr. Taylor reflected on his latest brush with television and how his point of view had shifted . " I 've got a lot looser hanging on to the choreography than I used to be , " he said . " For instance in the rain sequence in ' A Field of Grass , " I decided the choreography was the least important thing . I did n't want to see dance steps . I just wanted to see people battering around . I wanted to be horrified . " <p> Mr. Taylor admitted , however , that despite the fact that " The Wrecker 's Ball " was an innovative broadcast , made with people he admired , his real motivation in taking part was a bit subversive  --  that deep down he remained a dance purist . <p> " A lot of people see television who would n't dream of going to the theater , " he said . " What I 'd like is that they see something on TV that would make them want to come and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's what we really do . "
