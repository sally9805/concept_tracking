A new twist emerges in the turf war over Pacific Northwest forests as a new adversary invades the remaining haunts of the threatened spotted owl . // Just before dawn , a chill fog drifts through the old-growth redwoods of northwestern California . A group of birders breathe out puffs of steam as they listen to the growing chorus of morning birdsong . Then the gentle sounds of kinglets and thrushes are buried under a torrent of avian rock " n ' roll as the wild , intense hoots of a barred owl ring out . It is one of the first recorded sightings of this species in this part of California . A couple of months later , in May 1997 , an agitated barred owl will be found perched near the body of a freshly killed spotted owl in Redwood National Park , near the Oregon border , feathers of his presumed victim stuck in his talons . The latest turf war in the Pacific Northwest has reached redwood country . Dark-eyed woodland species , the barred owl and spotted owl are cousins that look so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Until recently , the two birds never met . The barred owl haunted forests east of the Great Plains , while the spotted owl lived only in old conifer forests of the Pacific Northwest . Now the barred owl is on the move-and it is moving in on the threatened spotted owl . " My educated guess is that the barred owl will have a dramatic effect on the spotted owl , " says Eric Forsman , a biologist with the U.S. Forest Service 's Pacific Northwest Research Station in Corvallis , Oregon . Twenty years ago , Forsman 's research on the northern spotted owl alerted conservationists to the bird 's dependence on mature forests , which had been heavily logged for decades , depleting much of the bird 's habitat . This information helped lead to the owl 's listing as a threatened species under the federal Endangered Species Act . More recently , Forsman and his colleagues have also been documenting the invasion of the barred owl into the Pacific Northwest . " For the last thirty years we 've been trying to come up with ways of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now all of a sudden , this huge monkey wrench gets thrown into the works . In the past , we could assume that what we were seeing in terms of habitat would help us to understand what was happening with the spotted owl . Now we do n't know if spotted owls are n't there because there is no habitat for them or because of the barred owls . " " The barred owl is a generalist , so it 'll eat almost anything , " says Tom Hamer , a consulting biologist who has studied the interaction of the two owls in the northern Cascade Range of Washington State . " It will eat flying squirrels and snowshoe hares , which the spotted owl also eats . But the barred owl will also hunt trout and amphibians in small streams and eat anything else that crosses its path , including grouse " Because the barred owl is such an adaptable hunter , it can live off a home range of only about 1,600 acres in the northern Cascades . But spotted owls of this region are specialists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voles . To find enough food to survive , spotted owls need large areas of the older forests that support their prey . In the redwood region ( from the Oregon border south to San Francisco Bay ) , spotted owl home ranges are generally small , because wood rats provide an abundant food source , but in the Cascades , ranges can span 30,900 acres .

Map : Recent West Coast sightings reflect the barred owl 's expansionist trend . // During territorial disputes , the owls will hoot at each other ( their calls are similar , but the spotted 's has a slower , hesitant tempo ) and fly at each other , but actual combat seems to be rare . " Barred owls always win , " says Hamer . " When it comes to territorial competition , the spotted owl always backs off . Part of it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of it is behavior . The spotted owl just is n't very aggressive . " How did the barred owl end up on the beleaguered spotted owl 's turf ? " It 's difficult to understand the failure of barred owls to colonize western North America prior to recent times without invoking human influence , " says Rocky Gutierrez , a professor at Humboldt State University in Arcata , California . He believes that human tinkering with the western landscape made the barred owl 's range expansion possible . As Euro-American settlers colonized the Great Plains , they planted shelter belts of trees across the Midwest and suppressed the natural fires that had kept the grasslands open . The result was a patchwork of small woodlands that may have served as stepping stones across the prairies for the barred owl , as they did for many birds formerly restricted to forest edges throughout eastern North America . One 1983 study of birds in western Minnesota found that only three of the fortyseven most abundant species using forest shelter belts were typical of the historic grasslands there . Closely related speciessuch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but have also mated on the plains . ( Such hybridization is fairly common and points up the fact that natural populations are always in flux and can defy human efforts to classify them . ) Some barred owls , too , started to form pairs with their spotted cousins as soon as the ranges of the two began to overlap in the Pacific Northwest . But these mixed pairs and their " sparred " offspring are relatively rare . Forsman finds the barred/spotted pairs producing hybrid young in his study region in Oregon intriguing , but he notes that when barred owls meet spotted owls , a takeover rather than a partnership is far more likely : " Barred owls move in , and spotted owls get darned hard to find or move out of the area . " Forsman does n't buy into the idea that humans inadvertently brought the barred owl west . " It 's not at all clear that this is some unnatural thing caused by humans , " he says . " Range , expansion could be occurring for reasons we do n't understand at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by chance . " Ned Johnson , of the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology in Berkeley , California , reviewed the range expansion of twenty-four species of birds in a 1994 paper and suggested that many of them , including the barred owl , were responding to a trend of increasing summer rainfall and warmer summer temperatures beyond their former ranges . It 's possible that slightly higher summer temperatures enabled barred owls to survive in the boreal forests of Canada-not the kind of habitat where they are typically found-and thus cross the continent north of the plains . The first records of barred owls making the crossing came from the Rocky Mountains in southern Alberta in 1912 . Those early sightings mean barred owls could have taken either a plains or a boreal forest journey westward , as the area could have been reached by either route . From Alberta , barred owls moved west and south . They reached British Columbia by 1943 and were common there by 1966 . The first sighting in Oregon took place in 1974 . By 1981 the owls were in northern California . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traversed the plains , even greater argument has arisen over their continued range expansion . Early findings had suggested to some biologists that logging in the west facilitated the barred owl 's invasion . Unlike spotted owls , barred owls can live and breed successfully in the young forests that grow up in the first few decades after clear-cut logging But later it became apparent that barred owls can also use older forests , typified by heavy canopy cover and the presence of large broken trees that provide ideal sites for cavity nesters like barred and spotted owls . " We examined barred owls in wilderness areas , where logging is not a dominant disturbance , " says Greg Hayward , of the University of Wyoming at Laramie . " We found barred owls moving into the largest wilderness south of Canada , suggesting that logging certainly is not necessary for the expansion of this owl . " Hayward 's colleague Anthony Wright , who has spent several years collecting field data from central Idaho wilderness areas , suggests that suppression of fire in Rocky Mountain forests may have created better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Hayward and Wright found barred owls were characterized by dense growth of young conifers under tall mature trees and by many trees that had perished due to disease and insects . These conditions are typical of stands that have not burned in a long time . Before EuroAmerican settlers arrived and began suppressing them , natural wildfires tended to be frequent but small and of low intensity . This produced a diversity of age classes of trees across the landscape . Fire suppression makes forests more homogeneous , so Wright 's theory conflicts with the idea that fragmentation-the breakup of large tracts of forest by clearcuts-helps the barred owl . " It 's not a simple issue at all , " says Forsman . " You hear a lot of people throwing around the word fragmentation : It makes a lot of us who work with these owls cringe . " While it 's clear that the loss of many of the older forests in its range has hurt the spotted owl , assessing the effects of fragmentation is more complicated . Some studies do show that clear-cuts may act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that time spent in clear-cuts increases the birds ' mortality rate . Spotted owls in fragmented forests may become nomadic or may switch mates . And the less old-growth forest there is available to a spotted owl , the more territory it must cover to find enough prey to survive . It 's especially difficult for spotted owls in the northern part of their range , where their staple prey item , the northern flying squirrel , is harder to find . " Neither of these owls uses clear-cuts , so fragmentation itself is not the key , " explains Tom Hamer . " But thirty or forty years after an area is clear-cut , you have a pole-sized stand of timber . Basically , we 've been growing a lot of habitat that 's perfect for the barred owl but marginal for the spotted . " In the northern Cascades , where barred owls have become numerous , Hamer found that spotted owls in logged landscapes had to hunt over such large areas that they were often competing with two or three pairs of barred owls . The ultimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who study them still believe habitat is the crucial factor that will make or break the species . " If habitat is available , there should be time for the spotted owls to develop ways to cope with barred owls , " says Gutierrez . " I think that the habitat threat is far more serious than the barred owl threat . " Forsman says that while the two species may coexist for a long time , he can also envision a long , gradual decline in parts of the range . He adds that " using the barred owl as a reason to stop trying to manage older forest habitat for spotted owls and other species is a serious mistake . We need to be thinking about lots of other creatures besides spotted owls . " The forest giants whose broken tops shelter spotted owl nestlings every spring also provide homes for many other animals , from the flying squirrel to the rare marbled murrelet , an eccentric seabird that nests on the broad limbs of oldgrowth trees . The big trees shade creeks where threatened salmon spawn , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish 's eggs . Whatever the outcome of the owls ' turf war , there will always be reasons to fight for these forests .
