Who is the most powerful person in the computer industry ? Arguably it is the frail , bespectacled , boyish figure shown below , the essential computer nerd , William Gates , 35 . His Microsoft Corp. , which he co-founded two years after dropping out of Harvard , is to computer software what IBM is to hardware  --  and now the two companies , formerly partners , are contenders in one of the industry 's most important battles . <P> Like IBM , Microsoft dwarfs its competitors . With $1.5 billion in sales and a market value of $12 billion , it is eight times larger than its nearest rival , Lotus Development . Gates is the world 's youngest self-made billionaire , with 42 million shares of Microsoft stock worth about $4.3 billion . The company did n't get so big so fast all alone : its close tie to Big Blue propelled it to the top . A decade ago , the two companies teamed up to develop the IBM PC , with Microsoft contributing the disk operating system , or DOS . After the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduce a new system based on IBM 's Personal System 2 machines and Microsoft 's Operating System 2 software . <P> But PS/2 and OS/2 have failed to catch on , mainly because of glitches and constant delays . As a result , the duo that created the industry 's hottest product of the 1980s is parting ways . IBM is developing its upgrade of OS/2 , while Microsoft is making a separate version , setting up a competition for dominance in desktop computers , the most important segment of an important industry . " It 's an interesting sideshow , " says Gates . " But it will be the marketplace that decides the winner . " <P> The industry has a considerable stake in this sideshow . OS/2 was supposed to be a new standard , but its weak showing so far has left the field open . AT &T,; for instance , is pushing its Unix operating system , and Apple Computer is promoting a program of its own . This week Apple will introduce an advanced version of the Macintosh operating system . <P> IBM may win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by year-end  --  but that does n't mean it will prevail . Microsoft is attracting a dedicated following to its successful Windows software , which lets users juggle a variety of programs at once . While Windows is not as muscular as OS/2 , Gates sees it as a bridge leading customers from DOS to OS/2 in a smooth transition . He thinks that is important : " Switching overnight to OS/2 is too great a leap , " he says . <P> Microsoft 's battle with IBM is far from Gates 's only concern . Prompted by his competitors , the Federal Trade Commission is looking into possible Microsoft violations of antitrust laws . At issue is whether the company 's role as supplier of both operating systems ( the basic programs that make a computer work ) and applications software ( the programs that do word processing , calculating and other jobs ) gives it an unfair advantage . More than 80% of all personal computers use the company 's DOS , while an additional 3% use OS/2 . One rival , Go Corp. , charges that Microsoft swiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stylus capable of writing on the screen rather than through a keyboard . Microsoft ( along with Hewlett-Packard ) is also the target of a suit filed by Apple charging the company with illegally copying the " look and feel " of its Macintosh graphics software .
