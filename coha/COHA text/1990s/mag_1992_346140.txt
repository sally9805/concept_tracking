IN A YEAR WHEN AMERICANS ARE KEEN TO THROW the insiders out and vote the outsiders in , women candidates continue to find uncommon success at the ballot box . Last week Pennsylvania Democrats tapped Lynn Yeakel , 50 , a Main Line matron with no experience in elected office , to run against Republican Senator Arlen Specter in November . Yeakel , who founded Women 's Way , a coalition of charities that raised nearly $2 million last year for a variety of women 's causes , jumped into the race after watching the all-male Senate Judiciary Committee grill Anita Hill . " I looked at those 14 men , " she said , " and I thought , These are not the people I want running my life and my children 's and grandchildren 's lives . " <P> Yeakel , who has said she wants to make the fall campaign in part a referendum on Specter 's memorably merciless questioning of Hill , joins Illinois Senate hopeful Carol Moseley Braun at the top of a growing list of women who are riding the perception that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system that has kept them at arms ' length . Daughter of an 11-term Congressman , Yeakel did not run a shoestring campaign ; she spent about $200,000 of her own money . <P> In another low-turnout presidential primary , Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton won 57% of the vote to former California Governor Jerry Brown 's 26% . Clinton 's win means that he now has three-fourths of the delegates he needs to secure the nomination . George Bush beat Patrick Buchanan by 77% to 23% , and though the victory still left the President a few delegates shy of clinching the + G.O.P. nomination , he seized it nonetheless . " It 's wonderful , " he said , " to be officially over the top . " <P> Clinton 's aides took heart from exit polls showing that 61% of Democrats believed that he had the honesty and integrity to be President . But the much touted survey was of Democrats only ; a far more telling gauge of the public mood  --  sobering for both Clinton and Bush  --  was polls showing that Texas billionaire Ross Perot is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in California , Texas and New Mexico , which together are worth one-third of the electoral votes required to win the presidency .
