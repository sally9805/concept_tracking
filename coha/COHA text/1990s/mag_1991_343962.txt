Elvis Costello is only 30 seconds into his set before a small audience in a Los Angeles TV studio when  --  boing !  --  a broken guitar string brings the music to a halt . During rehearsals , Costello has already groused about the lighting and the sound , so the tension in the wings is palpable . But the mercurial rocker calmly accepts a new guitar and starts again , launching into an acoustic rendition of Deep Dark Truthful Mirror . When Costello leaves the stage nine songs and an hour later , the audience is clamoring for more . <P> For the creators of Unplugged , MTV 's hit program featuring all acoustic performances , such unstrung moments are part of the fun . " Everything 's last- minute , and that 's the way we like it , " producer Alex Coletti says of the Costello segment , which will air next week . " It gives the show the loose feel we want . " <P> Unplugged 's easygoing atmosphere attracts stars . Elton John , Paul McCartney and Sting are among the names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help  --  or hindrance  --  of amplifiers and electric guitars . Performing without high wattage , muses Sting , makes it necessary " to rethink the music in terms of the arrangement , dynamics and presentation . You are forced to excavate the structure of a song from under layers of synthesizers and overdubbed voices . " <P> Performers are also drawn by the opportunity to play for 150 or so fans in a relatively intimate , informal setting . McCartney found the experience " a bit like going back to the old days , playing small clubs , so you get a pretty good idea of how your set is going down . " The ex-Beatle 's set went down so well that he has released a limited-edition , 500,000-copy recording of the session , which debuted last week at No. 14 on Billboard 's chart of Top Pop Albums . <P> When Unplugged was launched in January 1990 , it started out by presenting such offbeat performers as Sinead O'Connor , Neil Young and Squeeze . Then an appearance by ex-Eagle Don Henley " upped the ante , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show regularly ranks as one of the network 's best-performing programs . In April it scored a coup by snagging R.E.M . for one of only two concerts the band performed in the U.S. to promote its No. 1 album , Out of Time . Last month Unplugged broke musical ground by offering an acoustic jam headlined by rappers L.L. Cool J and De La Soul that exposed the R.-and-B. roots of the rap sound . " It sounded like something that would never work , " says McGrath . <P> For that matter , does n't Unplugged , with its absence of flashy imagery and souped-up electronics , run against the whole idea of MTV ? " In some ways it sounds like it would be anathema , " McGrath concedes . " But there 's something about Unplugged that 's very simple and very clear . You can appreciate that there 's somebody out there playing it one time , with no chance to mix it or fix it . " <P> McGrath hopes to continue expanding Unplugged 's appeal by signing up more women and trying provocative experiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blades and New York City rocker Lou Reed . Meanwhile , Unplugged has proved that MTV does n't need electricity to keep its audiences wired .
