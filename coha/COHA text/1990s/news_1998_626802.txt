<p> CHICAGO - No matter who wins the NBA 's labor fight , it 's clear who the big loser will be . <p> You , the fan . <p> This is no shock , of course . When baseball had its strike in 1994 and let an October go by without a World Series , fans lost . <p> Throughout sports history , work stoppages have been part of the business . And each time a league has problems , fans are alternately snubbed by multimillionaire owners and players , and then asked to embrace sports when the games start anew . <p> And now , with the NBA locking out its players and nobody expecting a collective-bargaining agreement before November , when the regular season would start , fans are braced for another slap in the face . <p> They already have received one , of sorts . <p> As is customary , season-ticket holders for the Rockets and the 28 other teams are being asked to pay for their tickets in full . For many teams , the deadline has passed . <p> There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay for a full season up front , but it does seem to be a curious public-relations move during a summer when owners are being captioned as greedy , inept and incapable of harnessing their spendaholic ways . <p> Disgruntled fans are a dime a dozen these days . But they have a fair question when they ask why they should pay for a full season ticket when even NBA commissioner David Stern has said he would not be surprised if part of the 1998-99 season is lost to the labor battle . <p> At places such as Michael Jordan 's restaurant and similar sports bars across the country , fans are fed up with the games played by owners , lawyers , agents and other powerful politicos in the sports marketplace . <p> " I think they 're holding the public hostage , " said Randy Creamer , 42 , a businessman who has lived in Chicago since 1975 and was meeting friends at Jordan 's last week . " Fans are not even considered in the equation by NBA owners . Not even close . <p> " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but big business now . And I think fans are disgusted by it . " <p> Perhaps . But NBA teams are banking on the fact fans wo n't turn away , even as owners and players try to outgreed each other during collective-bargaining negotiations . <p> The Rockets , for example , have set Wednesday as the deadline for season-ticket holders to pay for next season 's seats . They mailed notices in late May , well before the NBA imposed its lockout of players , that payment for season tickets would be due in mid-July . <p> " We 're proceeding with business as usual because we 're optimistic there will be a season as planned , " Rockets spokeswoman Angela Blakeney said . " There will be a leaguewide policy for refunds if games are lost due to the labor dispute . " <p> NBA representatives said the league must operate in a business-as-usual mode because nobody can predict when the labor standoff will be settled . With everything from tickets to scheduling to marketing strategies to game operations , the NBA is conducting its affairs as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> For the sake of logistics , that makes sense . If the labor impasse is solved in October , the league would be incapable of starting the season on time without the proper preparation . <p> But when it comes to season-ticket holders giving an owner thousands of dollars in July for a product that might not be available until Jan. 1 , fans wonder why a better payment schedule could n't be establish , perhaps an installment plan . <p> One longtime Rockets season-ticket holder says he is fed up with sports in general and the NBA in particular , but walking away is hard . <p> " I 'm tired of it all , " says Alan Reid , who has had Rockets tickets since 1973 . " And I 'm sincere when I say I 'm seriously considering not sending in my money this year . <p> " But the owners have us over a barrel because they know somebody will buy those tickets if I do n't . And after 25 years , I 've got great seats that I 'd really hate to lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lower level - cost $ 89.50 apiece last season . When he first purchased them in ' 73 , they were $ 8 . <p> " I 'm disenchanted with the whole system , " Reid said . " The players ' salaries are ludicrous . Nobody else in society has had their salary increase as fast as athletes . " <p> The NBA salary cap has escalated from $ 3.1 million when it was instituted in 1983 to an expected $ 30 million next season . <p> Ticket sales and television revenue combine to defray the bulk of that major expense . <p> Under the current system , an owner like the Rockets ' Leslie L. Alexander could generate about $ 20 million from ticket sales , which will earn interest whether or not there 's a lockout . And there will be no player contracts to pay during a lockout . <p> " You would think they 'd have learned from the baseball snafu , especially when it looked like the NBA was doing everything right , " said Peter Stark , a native New Yorker who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave of popularity through the 1980s and ' 90s and never has lost a game to labor strife . <p> Said Creamer : " Sports are no longer about the general public . It 's corporate America that owns sports now . And I do n't think it 's going to change for the next 20 or 30 years . " <p> Interestingly , Creamer and family members were leaving Jordan 's restaurant to go to Comiskey Park for a White Sox game . The price of their tickets - $ 5 each . <p> " And it wo n't even be close to a sellout , " Creamer said . <p> Throughout Stern 's term as commissioner , the NBA has enjoyed a terrific run . Attendance has been at more than 90 percent of capacity every season , and virtually every team has been profitable over the long haul . The worth of franchises has increased more than tenfold since the early ' 80s . <p> The league last season signed a four-year , $ 4 billion television contract with NBC . The owners are guaranteed $ 1 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> That 's not much of a gamble on NBC 's part . The network usually only televises one game - on Christmas Day - before Jan. 1 . The weekly telecasts do n't start until after the Super Bowl in late January . <p> Even the worst forecasts do n't have the NBA lockout going past the first of the year . <p> But Stern claims nearly half of the 29 teams in the league lost money last season . When he announced the lockout of players two weeks ago , Stern said many owners would be better off financially if there was no season rather than play under terms of the previous labor contract . <p> That might be true , but the NBA has done nothing to improve fan relations with the current labor squabble . If the players union and the league can not compromise and have a new agreement in place in time to start the season as scheduled , fans will let their anger be known . <p> Baseball has spent the past four years trying to repair the damage done by its strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Perhaps the NBA can survive the same sort of problems . <p> But , with season-ticket money set to start pouring in , the league is walking a thin line with its popularity .
