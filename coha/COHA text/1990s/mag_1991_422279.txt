Section : Cover Bipartisan Mathematics <p> After last year 's budget summit , Richard Darman claimed we would save $497 billion over five years . In January he admitted he was wrong by $319 billion . By July , the rest of the savings ' had disappeared . How many strikes before Darman is out ? <p> <p> DICK DARMAN is one of the brightest , most interesting , and most charming men ever to direct the eye-glazing Office of Management and Budget . His performance , on the other hand , is the most disastrous failure in the history of the job . <p> To put it bluntly , the U.S. fiscal and regulatory situations  --  budget ' and management '  --  are more out of control today than at any other time in U.S. postwar history . They threaten both the strength and the longevity of the current recovery , and could lead to a major crisis in financial markets over the next year . <p> In the last 18 months , the official OMB five-year deficit forecast has soared from $62.3 billion to $1.087 trillion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that 's with a $497-billion deficit reduction ' agreement in October 1990 , including $164 billion in higher taxes and other revenues . This means that the real forecasting and control error is 2,443 per cent . <p> States with far better fiscal records than this  --  New York , Massachusetts  --  are at the bottom of the financial rating services ' lists . Any corporate financial officer with one-tenth as big an error would be looking for a new line of work . Instead , Darman is still one of the most feared and powerful figures in the Bush White House . <p> Darman has been shielded from the consequences of his failure by a brain-dead opposition party , but most of all by the undeniably heady performance of George Bush and James Baker in presiding over the emergence of the U.S. as the only true superpower . ( Yet even that success was made possible by the immense defense dividend ' of Ronald Reagan , who used a modest rise in our defense spending to leverage a huge rise in the Soviets ' already backbreaking arms burden and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With that kind of lift-off , coupled with a U.S. economy that grew 3.8 per cent a year right through the first quarter of 1989 , the Darman - Sununu - Bush domestic agenda should have been easy : hold the line against the spenders and taxers and regulators , and ride out the decade in glorious growth . <p> Instead , spending and taxation have soared , regulation has exploded , and the economy on net has not grown at all since the fourth quarter of 1989 . Darman may be forced next January to revise the FY1992 deficit from an already obscene $348 billion to something over $400 billion . That 's 16 times as large as the FY92 forecast he made in his maiden budget voyage twenty months ago . And yet the statist-quo-minded Washington press corps has failed to mention it . <p> Cookie Monster <p> THE TENDER press treatment began in January 1990 , when Darman put his special stamp of pixie sophistication on his first federal budget , with a 21-page signed Director 's Introduction ' with the provocative title Green Eyeshades and the Cookie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone of a wry schoolmaster . The sheer size of the budget makes it seem like a monster , ' he said . It contains 190,000 accounts , ' and even if you reflected only a minute on each of them , it would take over a year of eight-hour days to complete this cursory review . <p> He attempted to lighten the discouraging task by joshing reporters with Sesame Street allusions suitable to their general fiscal illiteracy and naivete : As all monsters are , Cookie Monster is initially intimidating . His manner is gruff . His clumsiness occasionally causes damage . But quickly Cookie Monster comes to be seen as benign  --  indeed downright friendly . He has a few bad habits . He can not resist gobbling up anything and everything that might be consumed  --  especially cookies . He is the quintessential consumer . Yet clearly he means no harm . ' <p> Darman freely admitted that while the Cookie Monster 's excessive tendencies are not exactly ennobling ' at the same time its underlying motivation is clearly not malevolent . What harm it may cause is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little more than a compilation of cookies received , cookies crumbled , and crumbs spewed forth . ' <p> Today , that image would be offensive to the more than eight million people who are unemployed and scrambling for the crumbs of a crumbling economy , and the more than one million manufacturing workers who have lost their jobs since that budget fiasco was written . But at the time , Darman could still afford to be flippant . The Reagan expansion was still alive ( although barely ) and the Gramm - Rudman - Hollings deficit reduction law was still operative and far more effective than anyone realized . GRH was enacted in 1985 ; by 1989 , federal spending as a share of GNP had fallen from 23.9 per cent to 22.3 per cent , and the federal deficit had fallen from 5.4 per cent of GNP to 3 per cent . Outlays under the GRH regimen grew only 1.6 per cent per year in real terms . Deficits in constant dollars fell by 10.6 per cent per year . <p> Why the Red Ink ? <p> FOR YEARS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James Miller 's laidback management style and rumpled-suit public-choice homiletics , but during his tenure , the U.S. had the tightest spending control in its history . By contrast the Darman performance has been a hemorrhage of red ink . ( See table . ) <p> In fairness , some of Darman 's red ink was the result of the S &L; crisis and of the temporary outlay connected with the Iraq crisis , although the latter costs have since been offset by inflows from our allies . Miller was also helped by the fact that federal receipts in the Reagan expansion grew 19.3 per cent in real terms from 1985 to 1989 , for an average of 4.5 per cent per year . The miracle is that GRH and Miller together were able to keep Congress from spending all that revenue growth . <p> Revenues growing nearly three times as fast as outlays would be enough to make Wilkins Micawber crack a smile from under the green eyeshade . With GRH helping Miller keep a lid on spending , he could get better results than David Stockman without being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the federal presence and deficit , it was perhaps little wonder that a self-confident Darman , surveying the glittering break-up of the Old World Order and the implicit prospective decline in U.S. defense spending , should fall head over heels for Rosy Scenario . He even predicted that President Bush 's flexible freeze ' would not only hold spending to 3 per cent nominal , but speed up the GRH baseline ' path to surplus by FY1993 ! <p> Admitting this was based on the then-current economic-growth scenario , he offered a lower-growth scenario ' that moved to annual deficits of $50 billion or less from 1992 through 1995 . Even so , he opined from his exalted perspective that the consolidated federal deficit seems at worst to have stabilized . ' With a Bushy reference to the bad old Reagan years , he said , The pattern of continuous erosion that characterized the early and mid 1980s seems to have been broken . ' <p> Fortunately for his own historical excuses , Darman warned that all of this good news was assuming economic growth continues , ' and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being pursued not only by the Administration , but also the Congress and the Federal Reserve . ' <p> At the moment he wrote that , his Administration and the Fed were pursuing anything but growth-oriented ' policies . The Fed had an inflationary outbreak as its excuse , but the Administration was actively engaged in an expansive regulatory agenda , even as it deep-sixed the President 's only growth proposal , namely to cut the capital-gains tax . <p> Indeed , the only pro-growth ' measure in the entire 21-page director 's message was an oblique call for easier money from the Fed . The tight monetary and loose fiscal policies of the Reagan years were being traded in for the Jimmy Carter formula of loose money and more government . <p> Darman closed his condescending essay by suggesting : It may be apt to view all this metaphorically as a set of children 's games : the Budget as Cookie Monster ; its future threatened by hidden Pacmen ; its path a journey through Congressional Wonderland . But at some point , it is appropriate to put games aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is an obligation to be serious . At some point , partisan posturing must yield to the responsibility to govern . ' <p> Regulatory Pacmen <p> UNFORTUNATELY , what the Bush Administration decided to govern ' was everything from wintertime visibility over the Grand Canyon , to the number of consecutive days of subsurface wetness in your average backyard , to the monitoring of aromatics coming out of the local dry-cleaning plant , to the asbestos levels in quarry stone . . . <p> Last June , Melinda Warren of the Center for the Study of American Business ( CSAB ) concluded : Whether measured in current dollars or real terms , ' federal governmental spending on regulation is at its highest level in history and rising rapidly . . . . After a dramatic reduction in force in the early Reagan years . . . the regulatory personnel count is eclipsing the 1980 high-water mark . ' ( See table . ) <p> After the Reagan Administration spent seven years cutting rule-making from 90,000 pages a year in the Federal Register back to less than 55,000 , the curve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason for this explosion ? Environmental regulation has grown at an astounding rate . . . now comprising 38 per cent of the entire regulatory budget . . . the EPA budget has increased by 31 per cent in the last three years and staffing at this agency has expanded by 23 per cent . ' <p> Recently we had lunch with one of Bush 's top White House advisors and asked him who was responsible for this regulatory explosion . His answer was quick and short : Darman . When Stockman and Miller were here , would-be regulators faced a fight over every new rule in terms of costs versus benefits . But Darman does n't care . He just is n't interested . ' <p> That 's not entirely true . When we interviewed Darman in March 1990 on the subject of estimating health and environmental risks , we found him better informed on this subject than any other government official we had ever talked with . He told us : It is increasingly obvious that one of the greatest dangers of the 1990s is our increasing scientific capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This , combined with our society 's apparent willingness to place an infinite value on each human life , is bound to lead to investing more and more resources on smaller and smaller risks with less and less real return in actual risk reduction or health improvement . ' <p> Since 1986 , the average cost per cancer risk averted by EPA rules has escalated from some $440 million to more than $2 billion , with recent regulations under the Resources Conservation and Recovery Act reaching the astonishing level of $204 billion per single cancer risk . Darman knows this . In the FY92 budget he cites a 1990 rule on Hazardous Waste Listings for Wood Preserving Chemicals , where the EPA itself admitted the cost per cancer risk avoided was $5.7 trillion . <p> Yet not only did Darman sit idly by while Robert Grady , his OMB deputy on the environment , helped drive through a Clean Air Act whose $40-billion annual costs outweigh benefits by at least 1,000 to 1 , and whose actual health gains will be unmeasurably small , but he has allowed Congress to neuter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is supposed to be the risk budgeter . ' While George Bush took pride in his own 1981 - 88 role in using OIRA to reduce regulation , OIRA 's influence almost disappeared for two crucial years under Darman . <p> Why did Darman permit this ? He told us in March 1990 that he had deliberately cut back OIRA 's role to avoid confrontation in the budget process . I have taken some pains not to allow OIRA to be used as a delaying tactic . ' Darman was defeatist about how easily the regulatory agencies can beat the process . Again and again they will get court orders generated by third parties  --  advocacy groups  --  to which they have already leaked their proposed regulation . By the time we get a regulatory proposal we already have a court order demanding review and clearance within 24 hours ! ' <p> That did n't faze David Stockman . One White House source says , I remember seeing EPA Administrator Bill Ruckelshaus come out of Stockman 's office practically wringing his hands in frustration because he could n't handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' <p> Fortunately , in late 1990 Vice President Dan Quayle , with Al Hubbard and Dave McIntosh of his Competitiveness Council , stepped in and put OIRA back into the process , stopping one cockamamie regulation after another , forcing the EPA to justify the unjustifiable . <p> But by that time , most of the regulatory horses were out of the barn and running amok . Even as he was urging a growth agenda ' Darman was giving up on perhaps the most crucial aspect of that agenda , the restraint on government regulation  --  the Management ' part of the OMB title . <p> October Surprise <p> THE DANGER of being intellectually gifted ( as Darman surely is ) is that you can be tempted to think you are wise , too ; in Darman 's case , wise enough to do what no budget director had ever done before  --  namely , to negotiate with Congress to cut spending more than you raise taxes . If Darman had read even slightly in the literature of public choice ' economics , if he had understood even a scintilla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarked on the disastrous course he launched in February 1990 , which led to last October 's debacle . <p> It began with his admission that the 1991 deficit would not be the $63 billion he had so blithely predicted in January 1990 , but over $318 billion , and the 1992 deficit would not be the $25 billion he had forecast in his Cookie Monster ' budget but $281 billion . That 's a lot of cookies . <p> It continued surreptitiously with the March 11 Washington Post proposal by his close friend , House Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski , to solve ' the deficit crisis . Rostenkowski 's plan , a $500-billion , five-year package of taxes and spending cuts , looks so much like the final October outcome that many believe it was secretly designed by Darman himself . It included $196 billion in new taxes , and $319 billion in spending restraints . ' The final October compromise had $163 billion in higher taxes and $334 billion in alleged spending cuts . ' The Rosty plan called for getting rid of the tax bubble ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan simply moved the bubble above the congressional pay level , and raised effective top rates from 31 per cent to as much as 35 per cent . Chairman Rostenkowski called for higher gasoline taxes ( we got them ) , cutting defense spending 3 per cent a year in real terms ( we got that ) , and freezing entitlement cost-of-living indexation ( we did n't get that , naturally ) . <p> While Democrats immediately and publicly ran from Rosty 's bold ' proposal , the Administration treated it kindly and gently until , by May 1 , Darman was telling his friendly statists at Harvard 's Kennedy School of Government that it was time to confront the deficit with real risk-taking . ' It was vintage Darman , and it set the President up for the final slide to domestic-policy irrelevance . <p> One week later , on May 8 , President Bush agreed to a no-preconditions budget summit ' to begin on May 15 , with Darman now openly warning of fiscal and economic catastrophe if some grand compromise was not reached . <p> The Democrats were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held out until they got what they wanted , when Bush formally abandoned his no new taxes ' pledge and , by doing so , dashed realistic Republican hopes for congressional gains in November . <p> When even that failed to produce any budget compromise movement , Darman pushed up the midsession budget review ' by a month , and on July 15 predicted that without a budget compromise Congress would face a $105-billion spending sequester ' under GRH . He provided a book full of detail as to what this cut would mean to every congressional district , saying , Unless we get a credible and enforceable five-year plan of $450 to $500 billion , the sequester will take effect . That is the law . We will obey the law . ' <p> This frightened Republicans as much as Democrats , and despite the brief revolt led by House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich it cast the die for the final October 29 agreement that was hailed as a dramatic achievement ' by both the White House and Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill . Unfortunately that assessment was based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficit of $546.5 billion from 1991 through 1995 , a reduction of $497 billion from the midsession forecast of $1,044 billion . <p> But the forecast deliberately ignored the three most fundamental lessons of Washington fiscal history : first , that every tax increase will slow down the economy and revenue growth , making the deficit worse ; second , that historically every dollar of higher federal taxes has been accompanied by at least $1.22 in higher spending ; and third , that every budget summit , without exception , has produced higher deficits , not lower ones . <p> In short , the Darman Grand Design was a grand delusion from the get-go . By January Darman was forced to admit the five-year deficit had risen to $865.4 billion , meaning that $319 billion or 64 per cent of the deficit reduction ' had already disappeared . <p> In the same month , Washington policy economists Gary and Aldona Robbins published a paper for the National Center for Policy Analysis predicting the five-year deficit figure would be $1,045.2 billion . Darman made them prophets in July 1991 , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was now $1,086.5 billion . Less than ten months after the deficit-reduction agreement , the whole reduction and then some had disappeared in new red ink , exactly as the Robbinses had forecast . <p> If two economists working without armies of number crunchers can tell you within 4 per cent what the revised figure will be , while the director of OMB was still denying it , then it 's clear Darman is n't any better at the Budget ' side of his office than he has been in Management . ' <p> Why Is Darman Still Here ? <p> DARMAN SURVIVES because he understands that the national media never cared a fig about the deficit except as an excuse to raise taxes and spending . As soon as both were raised , the deficit disappeared as an issue . <p> As David Rosenbaum wrote in the July 14 New York Times , just a year ago , when the FY91 deficit was projected at $231 billion , Darman warned that drastic consequences would occur if a way could not be found to reduce that deficit . ' Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed : Nobody seems to care . The economists and political scientists who filled the nation 's op- ed pages last year with doomsday columns about the dangers of the deficit have turned their attention elsewhere . ' Most of all , the deficit was used as the weapon to savage the Reagan tax cuts as huge giveaways to the rich , ' and to force Republican retreat on the top income-tax rates as the painless solution to the deficit . <p> The problem with such notions is revealed by facts that the Bush folks , including Darman , strangely never mention : from 1981 to 1988 , when the top tax rate fell from 70 per cent to 28 per cent ( 31 per cent for the bubble ' ' ) , tax revenues actually paid by the top 5 per cent rose by 50 per cent in real terms , more than twice as fast as they rose from 1974 to 1981 , when all effective rates were rising . <p> More important , when the 1986 tax reform lowered the top rate from 50 to 28 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the rich soared at their fastest rate in history . In 1988 , total income taxes rose a surprising 12.7 per cent , or nearly $47 billion . Of that increase , $36 billion , or 77 per cent , was paid by the top 2.3 per cent of all taxpayers . Amazingly , $19.4 billion of that , or 41 per cent , was paid by the 65,000 taxpayers with incomes over $1 million , only 0.06 per cent of the taxpayers . It would be impossible to construct a more progressive ' outcome . <p> In short , lowering rates on the topmost brackets massively stimulated the movement of income out of unproductive shelters back into the productive and taxpaying economic base , just exactly as the Reagan economists had predicted . That brilliant demonstration of the Laffer Curve in action had no impact on the budgeteers . Instead , they invented one lie after another to turn its message upside down . In the process they dismantled the central plank of tax reform , namely getting rid of distorting shelters in return for lower rates . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already lining up . <p> Those who think the Democrats are really worried about any of this are as ill informed about the Washington political pathology as Darman apparently is . As far as the House and Senate leaders are concerned , they got exactly what they wanted . They got President Bush to break his political promise . They got a roll-back of the Reagan tax cuts , and an open assault on capital formation and wealth creation . <p> In short , they made fools of this Administration on the domestic front . With Darman 's help , they have unraveled the Reagan Revolution in just two years , and have emasculated the conservative free-market , low-tax , low- regulation agenda . <p> That 's why  --  despite some grumbling , so as not to give away the show  --  Dick Darman still enjoys strong support in the only place that impresses the Bushies , the Washington media , where statism and government are the only game in town , and the Cookie Monster always wins . <p> CHART : TABLE <p> CHART : TABLE <p> CARTOON : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationally syndicated columnist for the Detroit News . <p>
