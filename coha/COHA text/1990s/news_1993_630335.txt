<p> Home improvements will take a $ 104 billion bite out of American homeowners ' wallets this year . As the size and cost of remodeling projects have increased , so have the number of programs for financing home improvements . <p> When remodeling your home , you may wish to finance the project through a personal loan , a home-equity loan , credit union funding , an insurance policy , a bank or a savings and loan . Your contractor may be able to help arrange financing , but it is important for you to investigate different sources of funding . <p> It 's also a good idea to compare the amount you qualify to borrow , the interest rate , terms , closing costs and tax considerations . <p> If you can not pay for the project without a loan , it is a good idea to add a clause to your remodeling contract that it is valid only if you obtain the financing you want at the rate you specify . <p> If your home improvement work is the result of damages that are covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to determine the extent of coverage before signing a contract . <p> Here are some of the most common types of financing for home remodeling jobs : <p> Home-equity financing . This is a line of credit or a loan secured by a second mortgage on your home . Typically , home-equity financing is available only on owner-occupied primary residences : single-family homes , condominiums , town houses or 2- to 4-unit apartment buildings . <p> Half of the nation 's home-equity financing is used for remodeling and major home improvements . There are two basic types of a home-equity financing . A home-equity line of credit . This can turn your home 's unmortgaged value into a revolving line of credit that easily can be tapped by check or credit card . The credit line is given up to a specified percentage of the value of the home , minus the outstanding balance of the first mortgage . <p> Typically , banks and other lenders extend credit lines ranging from $ 5,000 to $ 500,000 . Borrowers draw funds using a check and pay interest only on the money actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interest rate charged is variable and indexed to the prime lending rate . So , interest charges can rise or fall based on movements in the prime rate , which currently is 6 percent . Lenders typically charge prime , plus a profit margin of 1 or 2 percentage points or more . Generally , the rate is adjusted monthly . <p> A home-equity line of credit usually is set up for five to 15 years . During the term of the line , borrowers pay interest only . The principal usually is due in a lump sum or balloon payment . In addition , the lender typically charges an annual fee to handle administration and billing . This can range from $ 20 to $ 30 . Home-equity loan . This typically is a straightforward second mortgage with a fixed interest rate . Depending on the lender - usually a bank or savings and loan association - the borrower generally is required to make amortized monthly payments of both principal and interest charges that are spelled out in the loan terms . <p> A home-equity loan is more conservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each month and the consumer knows exactly when the loan will be paid off . <p> The application process for a home-equity loan is much like applying for a first mortgage . The property is appraised , the borrower 's credit history is reviewed , and ability to repay the loan is evaluated . <p> Fees for a home-equity loan can be expensive . Expect to pay an application fee of $ 100 to $ 400 . In addition , some lenders charge points . One point is 1 percent of the loan amount . If a lender charges 1.5 points on a $ 30,000 home-equity loan , the fee at closing would be $ 450 . <p> Like any loan secured by a lien on your home , an equity credit line does create the risk of losing the roof over your head if you ca n't repay . <p> Interest on either a variable rate home-equity line of credit or a fixed-rate second mortgage is tax deductible if the money is used for home improvement , college tuition or major medical expenses . <p> The loan used for home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the home plus improvements . If you want to borrow an extra $ 10,000 for a trip to Europe , do n't expect to deduct the interest . <p> Home-improvement loan . Usually written for five to 10 years , a home-improvement loan may carry a lower interest rate than a straight personal loan . If you borrow less than $ 5,000 , the loan may be unsecured . If it is secured with collateral - usually the home - technically it is a second mortgage . <p> Second mortgage . To qualify for a second mortgage , a homeowner must have a good chunk of equity in his home - usually at least 20 percent . Borrowers may have to pay the same kind of closing costs as a first mortgage . <p> The interest rate on a second mortgage can be fixed or adjustable . Generally , a borrower can get more money at a lower rate and for a longer term with a second mortgage than with an unsecured loan . <p> Refinancing a first mortgage . If you have loads of equity in your home , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that equity and put it to work . <p> At today 's low mortgage rates , homeowners who refinance a first mortgage usually end up with money in their pockets and much lower monthly mortgage principal and interest payments . The drawbacks include high closing costs , appraisals and legal fees . A first-mortgage refinance takes years to pay off . It should n't be taken lightly . <p> Federal loan programs . Banks and mortgage companies may offer Federal Housing Administration-insured loans for home improvements . The FHA will insure remodeling loans for work that improves the " livability " of a home . However , Uncle Sam will not insure FHA loans for frivolous improvements such as a swimming pool or a tennis court . <p> The FHA requires that the lender approve any contractor arranging for a government-insured loan but does not guarantee the work of the contractor . Beware of anyone who tells you the FHA approves the contractor 's work or endorses the contractor . <p> The FHA 203(k) government-insured loan program frequently is used for the purchase and rehabilitation of gutted houses . The program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big enough . <p> In the six-county Chicago area , the maximum loan amount is $ 151,725 . Minimum down payment is 3 percent to 5 percent of the loan amount .
