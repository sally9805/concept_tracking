Eight days after his surgery , Ezra Keneret came home . He managed to pull himself up the banister of the carpeted stairs to his bedroom , drop off his loose slacks and sport shirt , get into pajamas , and fall back on the pillows his wife , Marcia , had propped up for him . <p> On the reading table , next to the panel for the stereo and video systems , was a pile of scripts and new books , which had come in while he 'd been in the hospital . ( Ten years ago there 'd have been fifteen or twenty of each ; now there were four and five . ) Marcia was ambitious for him . He could hardly lift , let alone read , them ; and certainly not read them seriously-for projects . Still , through bone-deep fatigue , his old life , which might still be there to live , managed a reminiscent tug . Next to the scripts was a pile of letters , first class , no bills . Marcia would have paid some and sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marcia , fragile Marcia , had come through his surgery like a champ . Long ago , she had learned how to use fragility to defend her life , and Keneret to use it to defend his " Ca n't come . Marcia 's a little low . " <p> Not that she was n't low , was n't fragile . No one he knew well suffered as Marcia sometimes suffered , yet to work , as she worked , at her book-binding-or , when he 'd first met her , at films-required sisyphean tenacity . Wendell Spear said she could run a studio . That , no . Marcia 's strength was as special as her fragility , partly because she knew how to use it . In emergencies , the few they 'd known , she summoned what was needed . Much of it went-or used to go , for she had n't worked on her own in his pre-surgical months-into the manual artistry she 'd discovered as a hobby in a UCLA course when she was working for-and as relief from - Mickey Blumenthal . <p> The first letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Loor had started . It was signed Agnes Desoger ( the " A " of HAL ) . I am writing in the hope that I may persuade you to participate in our INTERNATIONAL FILMMAKERS BIOGRAPHY SERIES , a reference project that publishes autobiographies and biographies of the world 's leading filmmakers . We note that there is no full-length biography of you , and only two full-length studies of your films , including the recent one by Wendell Spear . Our hope is that you would consent to write , or to dictate to an assistant ( whom we could supply ) , an essay of ten thousand words or more about your life and work . <p> Why the " we " and " our " ? Agnes was no stranger . For that matter , HAL Inc. would n't exist if he had n't plucked Leet out of the middle of the Pacific . The personal insult of the impersonal . The rest of the letter concerned the fee-$3,000-the distribution-largely to librariesand a list of " your peers already included in the series . " Agnes added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W volume , with essays " of or on " Walsh , Wanger , Welles , Wellman , Wenders , Wilder , Wise , and Wyler . <p> Marcia followed his lunch tray and the new Filipino girl-gorgeous-who carried it into his room . " This is Maria-Lourdes , " she said . " Lourdes " was pronounced bi-syllabically . <p> Keneret flapped his fingers at the respectful , lovely face under the black braids . " Welcome . " <p> " Thank you , sir , " said the beauty . She had a grand smile , perfect teeth . Keneret imagined a clan of Filipino beauties chewing plantain leaves for dental splendor . She bent to put the tray in his lap , and Keneret saw beautiful , small breasts . Another tug in his depleted system . <p> " Thank you , Maria . " <p> " Lourdes , sir , " she said politely , bi-syllabically . <p> " From the shrine ? " <p> " Excuse me , sir ? " <p> " The French shrine , Lourdes . " <p> " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lourdes , " said Marcia . " I 'll see you downstairs . " <p> " What happened to Babette ? " asked Keneret . <p> " She got a walk-on in the Demme picture . I told her to hold on here , but she 's thinking Oscar . She made you a get-well card . " <p> " Did I know she was an actress ? " <p> " She was n't . You did . " <p> Keneret drank the kiwi and passion fruit juice from his favorite Waterford glass , many-faceted as a fly 's eyes . ( Sometimes he studied the shatterable world through it . Not today-today he had all he could handle lifting it to his lips . ) There was a golden fold of no-cholesterol omelette , a brioche with diet-margarine and lite-boysenberry jam on a blue and gold plate , decaffeinated coffee in his favorite mug , and a salade nicoise , a specialty of Francine , the cook from Martinique . " Very beautiful . A little heavy . " <p> " The meal ? " <p> " The presentation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Her long darkeyed face registered the weakness of this strong husband . " Want the salad on the table ? " <p> " Please , " he said . " Wo n't be able to eat it . It 's lovely though . A Sisley salad . " <p> " Music ? " <p> The pyjama 'd shoulders shrugged . <p> " Chopin ? Lehar ? Top Hat ? " <p> " Even that 's too heavy . " <p> " Eat what you can . Sleep . Maybe you 'll be up to walking down the hall and back . Festina lente . " <p> " Ca n't remember . " <p> " Make haste slowly . " <p> " Brilliant . If there 's a choice . " She took away the quarter-eaten omelette . " The trip home was exhausting . In the hospital , I just floated . Now I 'm on my own power . Or yours ; not much left of mine . Of me . " He handed her the editorial letter . " They want me to write about myself when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tray on a wicker table beside a vase of daffodils , sat on the embroidered seat of an Empire chair , and read the letter . " Nice . Belated , but nice . Maybe you 'll feel like doing it in a few weeks . Something different , an unsentimental self-portrait . " <p> " No self to portray . " <p> " That 's fatigue talking . " <p> " The only voice I have . " <p> His mission was to walk , first around the room , then up the hall , forty feet , then back . When he managed that twenty-five times , he went downstairs and walked in the garden . In a week , though fatigue still gripped him much of the day , he was walking half a mile along Ocean Front Drive and back to the house on 9th Street . <p> He was also looking with appreciation at Lourdes . Her smiles were tonic . ( Marcia was the prescriber . ) The girl told him about her nuns ' school in Manila , her seven brothers and sisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineer . " When my friends hear I am going to America , they say , You going to heaven , Lourdes . ' Then Mister 's wife , Missus , say she ca n't afford to keep me . I go to the agency , and there is the call from Missus Marcia . " Then there is Padre Luis , at Saint Anselmo s , there are her Filipino friends in Santa Monica , and , best of all , there is the American she meets at Saint Anselmo 's . " He work for Pacific Gas-Electric . " Christmas , he 'd taken her and his twin sons to see the whales in Baja . " Padre Luis give us a Compatibility Questionnaire . We score 85 percent . " <p> Lourdes had long , solid legs , a perfect rear , charming breasts , and black eyes with fires in them . Every fluent move she made , every charming word she spoke , peeled away his fatigue . <p> " Very good result , Lourdes . " <p> Down 9th Street from the Kenerets ' was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's semi-official eyesore . It belonged to the Iwinagas , a Japanese couple who 'd owned it since the thirties and managed to keep it when they were shipped off to an Idaho concentration camp during World War II . <p> It was their small front lawn that bothered the neighbors . Its borders were lined with plastic tulips ; the branches of one authentically leguminous shrub were hung with infant shoes , ancestral snapshots , sacred message scrolls , Christmas bulbs , and other trinkets of peculiar piety . Keneret not only did n't complain about the house , he adored it . " They 're the only people on the street you 'd bother using in a picture . " Mr. Iwinaga had worked thirty years for the County Water Commission . Now retired , he and his wife patrolled and guarded the street ( except on Sunday , when they were picked up by their daughter and taken to Woodland Hills ) . Neighbors instructed delivery men to leave packages with the Iwinagas , who had keys to half the block 's houses . " We should subsidize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The street 's thief-less because of them . " <p> " Yes , they 're quite terrifying , " said Marcia , who brought them back presents from trips ( starfish and shells were Mrs. Iwinaga 's favorites ) and treats from stores out of walking range . ( The Iwinagas were part of the half of one percent of non-driving California adults . ) Keneret would deliver the gifts to the chocolate house where , peeking through broken blinds , he made out six-foot-high stacks of National Geographics . " Like termiteria , " he told Spear . " Inside , like outside , their own world . " <p> " Makes sense to me , " said Spear , who spent hundreds of hours talking at-sometimes to-the palms and cypress that surrounded his hillside cabin . <p> Thirty years ago , his first week in the Santa Monica house ( the week his divorce from Elizabeth went through ) , Keneret had looked out the window and seen what appeared to be a large dog on the front lawn . He went out to give it a boot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and knees , picking away at a patch of ground . " Four reaf crovers . Awright pick 'm ? " <p> " Certainly . Pick away . Many as you want . Anytime . " <p> The next week , Zlotnick , the Kenerets ' Bulgarian gardener , dug up the clover . Keneret went down the street to apologize . He found Mrs. Iwinaga on her knees draping a tinfoil necklace on the ancestral bush . " I want to apologize for the four leaf clovers . The gardener dug them up without asking us . " <p> " I thought you not want me pick rawn . " <p> " Not at all . I 'll ask him to plant another patch . Will that be okay ? " <p> " Okay . " <p> In these thirty years , the Kenerets had seen the Iwinagas shrivel . Mr. Iwinaga 's greetings were now toothless , misdirected smiles . Mrs. Iwinaga had changed less . ( Perhaps the reason was her unchanged black wig . ) She 'd slowed a bit , but still mowed her tiny lawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three or four times a week , she wheeled shopping bags back from the Pavilion Market on Montana . When Zlotnick was n't around , she gave Marcia tips about the garden : " That not grow good in Carifornia . " <p> A.S.-After Surgery-Keneret , walking the streets , saw them far more than usual . In an L.A. Dodgers cap , Mr. Iwinaga sat on the porch grinning at the world . Mrs. Iwinaga asked , " Where you been ? I not see you . " <p> " In the hospital . I had an operation . " <p> " You rook thin . You walk srow . I thought something wrong . What you have ? " <p> " My stomach made its way through a hole in my diaphragm into my chest . " <p> " That not good . " <p> " They put it back where it belongs . " <p> " Good . You eat , you walk , you get better at home . Hospitah ki ' people . I have three opations . " She hoisted her red sweater and showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made out a faint line of gray hair that led toward Mr. Iwinaga 's little love plot . She turned around and lowered her yellow slacks . Above the left buttock was another trench . She turned again , and pointed to her crotch . " Third one here . Husband has scah on chest . Where yours ? " <p> " Here . " He touched his side . " It runs to the back . Fifteen inches . " <p> " Ooh . That rong . " She stared , waiting , but though there was no traffic on 9th Street , Keneret did not raise his shirt . <p> " When husband has transprant , I take him out hospitah . They no feed good . I bing home , I make soup , eggs , ice , he get better . Good you home , you get better . " A nod bounced the black wig high enough to show grey stubble . " Eat egg , ice , soup . " <p> " I can eat anything now . " <p> " Good . Now get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though Keneret 's recent history was known , there were more scripts and books . Keneret looked into them . He read rapidly , getting a fix on the story line , the characters , the idea . It took him fifteen minutes to get a book 's cinematic possibilities . If they were good , he dove in " for flavor , scenes , even the mental climate if it 's there . " <p> Wendell Spear said , " You have n't read a book as a book since college . " ( Keneret 's two years at Chapel Hill in the nineteen forties . ) <p> " I do n't like to be overpowered by writers . " <p> " Only time I 've seen you overpowered was under anesthetic . " <p> " Which was bliss . That kind of oblivion is bliss . " <p> " I should take a room at Cedars Sinai instead of going to Paris . " <p> Twenty-odd years ago , when he was forty , Keneret realized that he was no further along than he 'd been at thirty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those five years become " the outstanding filmmaker of his generation , one of the great filmmakers of all time . " ( Film historians wrote as if Edison , Melies , and Porter were contemporaries of Caesar . ) Keneret , when considered at all , was " a minor master , " " a filmmaker 's filmmaker . " If anything , his audience was smaller than it was twenty years ago . Still , a successful Keneret film had twice outgrossed an unsuccessful Harmel one . Despite this , Harmel controlled his films and had steady financing , while Keneret struggled for years to get projects financed . Harmel was a friend , he cared for him and admired-no , loved-his films more than any others , he 'd learned and borrowed from them and from him . He tried to avoid the barb of comparison , but it was constantly thrust at him . <p> One of a hundred barbs in Keneret 's innards was that the only Keneret Festival-a one-week show of his films-had been not in New York or Paris but in Bowling Green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost every other year . " I could spend my life now listening to lectures on my life then , " Floyd said . " Shaking hands with people who tell me who I was boffing back in 1951 . At two o'clock , June 12 . " <p> Four years before Keneret ' s surgery , Harmel had asked if he would stand in for him at a Harmel Festival in Sydney . " I hate to travel , hate location-shooting . You love it , filming in Kashmir or Kansas . You 're an homme de terrain . I 'm an homme de cabinet . " ( The two old directors sometimes spoke pigeon French , a way of separating themselves from surrounding inferiors who supposedly did n't know French or much else that counted . ) " Australia 's got more than kangaroos and koalas . You can work up that old story about Whatshisname , the guy who designed Canberra and married the woman who did the drafting for him . You still hold the option ? " <p> " Burley Griffin , " said Keneret , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Floyd forgot nothing except , perhaps , the names and faces of his bedpartners . ) <p> " If you do it , I 'll throw in a week in Tahiti or Fiji . You can use some relief from this place . " <p> Floyd knew that things had n't been going well for Keneret , usually not a concern for him , but now it seemed to fuse their interests . Keneret could talk about his , Floyd 's , films-which he did better than any critic , including his cozy friend Spear-and enjoy what Harmel thought he enjoyed too much , seeing new places . Harmel liked his cabinet . Harmel was one of Keneret 's coordinates , Spear the other . Harmel roused and inspired him ; Spear , though a curmudgeon and complainer , calmed and bolstered him . <p> In the fifties , Spear had married Vanessa DeGroot , an actress who looked like Eva Marie Saint and lost roles to her . They had one daughter whose own daughter was now the core of Spear 's emotional life . ( Spear 's daughter was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her estrangement from her father had estranged her from him as well . ) In the late sixties , Spear had stopped regular reviewing and lecturing and " retreated " - his word-to a cabin in the Malibu hills . " To enjoy wild life that does n't drive you wild . " One morning , he came back from a walk to find Vanessa dead of a heart attack . Since then , he 'd lived alone , chopped wood , read , wrote a little , drank a lot , took bird walks , occasionally went to film festivals , and , now and then , shared the place with a woman . He worried about money till he sold his filmography to a Japanese university for eight hundred thousand dollars . " You see what watching movies can do for a fellow . " The money relaxed him a bit . " Not that I 'm rich . The poverty line in Malibu is five million . But my father would 've been dumbstruck . " <p> Father Spear had been a Church of England clergyman , who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-confident than I. Could n't pee without worrying about the bowl . Compared to him , I 'm a rock . " <p> Despite his complaints , Spear had a gift for happiness . He loved eating , drinking , and smoking cigars , and he relished the world 's flora , furniture , and fauna , which , to Keneret , were undifferentiated background . ( He used Spear 's knowledge of them in films . ) Spear liked being consulted by Keneret ; it made him feel that he was still a part of what he 'd spent years describing . <p> He cared a great deal both for Keneret and his films . That Keneret relied on his criticism and encouragement was a central part of his life ; he 'd grown to depend on it . The book he wrote about him-his third and last book-was the monument to this interdependence . He 'd started the book two years before Keneret 's surgery , when his friend seemed to be fading away both physically and as a filmmaker . After the Leet project fell through , everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His diminished size and strength seemed the physical expression of this . <p> Keneret did little about either . Doctor-shy , he 'd say , " Why should I see doctors ? I 've got the blood pressure of a kid . Most guys my age have reflux problems and hiatal hernias . All I have to do is stay off coffee and booze . And no ice water at meals . " <p> In Bella Bigger 's column , Spear had read , " Ezra Keneret , old flickmaestro , was seen staggering out of Fanciullo ' s . Not drunk mind you . This sauce , ' a friend of the director 's assures Bella , is , we 're afraid , much spookier . EK is thin as a rail , and about the same color . ' Could it be that the maker of Lianne and Inside Out has been afflicted with the plague which begins with ' A ' ? " <p> Even after Rock Hudson came out of Hollywood 's biggest closet , AIDS was thought of as communism had been in the fifties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spear was sure Keneret did n't have AIDS , but the column did make clear how bad he looked , and Spear realized for the first time that he might lose his friend . The first thing to do was to get him to a doctor ; the second was to let people know what a wonderful director he 'd been . Spear , who had n't even written a review in four years , got out a yellow pad and , in two hours , outlined what would become his book . With the editorial , secretarial , and emotional help of Leet de Loor , he finished it in five months . <p> One morning , a few months before his surgery , Keneret caught Marcia eyeing him . She looked as if she 'd been in a fight , her eyes bagged , the cheek flesh mottled . She said , " If Zack Wool handled your taxes the way you handle yourself , you 'd sue him for malpractice . " <p> " I 'm doing her in , " he thought , then said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's just been a bad time . " <p> " Too long a time . You think if the doctors find something , the word 'll get around and nobody will use you . " <p> " I 'm not exactly swimming in offers . " <p> " Would it kill you to throw in the towel ? " <p> " Managers throw in towels . " <p> " Be a manager . Better , be a spectator . Just do n't be a fighter anymore . Nobody expects an old-not old , but a guy who 's done as much as you-to go on doing more . " <p> " They gave up on Altman , and look what happened . He 's stronger than ever , they 're licking his boots . Look at Kurasawa , making them at eighty . Look at Harmel . " <p> " Yes , look . A Bishop in Check . Dr. West Forgives . Stinkers . " <p> " Ford made stinkers . Hawks made stinkers . I 've made stinkers . But three years ago Floyd made The Way You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory ; something he 'd preserved in the cellar . " <p> " That 's what we old guys have . We 've got good stuff aging down there . " He raised the blue Royal Doulton cup and touched his temple with the gold rim . " I 'm still seeing films . Not day and night , the way I used to , but they 're up here . And " - cup to his chest- " here . Even " going lower , though he detested the cock-and-balls gesture-language that was , regardless of gender , Hollywood 's current lingo- " here . If I do n't make them , they wo n't get made . " <p> Marcia floated around the table , pressed what he 'd avoided pressing , then kissed where the gold rim had been . " I know that , sweetheart . There are beautiful films only you can make , but maybe it 's making you sick not to make them . You ca n't take it . Nobody can . It 's the oldest story around here . It happened to Griffith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orson , decade after decade , trying to get films made . Slow death . I could n't bear that for you . " <p> " They broke Orson when he was thirty . It does n't have to be like that . Look at the way Huston went down to the wire , making The Dead through his inhalator . I know the score : the Old are in our way . Unless they-we-turn ourselves into characters , we 're hated . I hate the oldness part of me . Most of it . I ca n't help it that I have a few trophies , a little money , even some power . It does n't mean I 've had my share and should turn over and die . Thank God I 've got my marbles . And the will to use them . If I can still do what nobody else can , why should I throw in the towel ? What else am I ? What else is there ? " <p> Marcia spread her hands and presented the lawn , the pool , the patio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honeysuckle , the silver and glass on the table . The hands moved to his shoulders , his neck , the fingers working ease into him as if he were a swatch of tooled leather . " This : Ez and Marcia 's lucky lucky de luxe world . " <p> " Sure . That 's right . You know I know how nice it is . And you , the heart of it all . But you know it 's not enough . " " I do n't know that . " <p> " You know it . You 've got your binding . You need it . All this , " pointing to the lawn , the honeysuckle , the lemon trees , the pool , " is wonderful . But it 's just the set . Where 's the story , the film , the action ? Life . Where 's the life ? " <p>
