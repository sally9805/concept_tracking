At nightfall in the marble palace of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , an unusual gathering of Middle Eastern leaders sat down for iftar , the meal that breaks the daylong Muslim fast during the holy month of Ramadan . It is traditionally shared with family and close friends , but at Mubarak 's side were not only Jordan 's King Hussein and Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat , but Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin as well . His inclusion was meant to show a new level of acceptance for Israel among the Arab leaders who have signed formal peace agreements with the country . <P> What really brought the four together , however , was a sense of desperation . Something was needed , as Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa put it , to save the peace process from collapse . ' ' If all that was required were the serious talk and earnest pledges of the summiteers , a comprehensive peace in the Middle East would be at hand . But after five hours of discussion , Moussa emerged to read out a predictable communique . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outbreaks of bloodshed , terror and violence ' ' that have brought the negotiations almost to a halt . The one visible new agreement was to keep on talking . <P> Some officials on both sides said they were encouraged by the procedural push . This week Israel and the Palestinians are to reopen their talks in Cairo , while Arafat and Rabin are to meet at a border crossing on the Gaza Strip . Then on Feb. 12 , the summit group 's foreign ministers will convene in Washington to move ahead on economic and security measures . <P> Senior Arab officials believe the summit displayed the parties ' solidarity and bolstered rather than pressured Rabin . These officials realize the Israeli leader needs help standing up to his own voters , who are increasingly unwilling to make deals with the Palestinians while Islamic terrorists continue to send suicide bombers to blow up Israelis . <P> In Jerusalem , Yossi Beilin , Israel 's Deputy Foreign Minister , also insisted that the summit would have a positive impact . It showed , he said , that a bloc is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israelis , the talkfest in Cairo changed nothing . The main issue is whether the Islamic terrorist campaigns will be halted . <P> The negotiations are caught in a vicious circle . For the Palestinians , the key issue is what was promised in the 1993 accord : moving Israeli troops out of West Bank towns and opening the way for Palestinian elections . Arafat told Rabin that his mandate must be extended throughout the territories . But Rabin is in no mood to withdraw the army from areas where Israeli settlers need protection . <P> Palestinians have little patience with Israeli hesitancy . Many were irate that the meeting made no mention of the growing Israeli settlements  --  one was authorized in East Jerusalem last week  --  that they consider violate the spirit of the agreement . <P> The region 's political leaders are publicly displaying their faith in the process , but they know their best efforts can be undercut at any time by another incident like the bombing that killed 21 Israelis last month . After reading the Cairo summit 's communique last week , a West Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ones who decide when to attack Israeli targets  --  not Arafat , not Rabin , not Hussein , not Mubarak . ' ' Unfortunately , that is all too true .
