Sometimes resolving an " irreconcilable " conflict just requires a new way of looking at the problem . <p> <p> " The invaders have been on Kya three months , " the man said angrily . He seemed ready to jump out of the screen and pound on Delores Jones " desk . " Three months . The kya ca n't stop them . When is the UN going to fight ? " " I 'm sorry , sir . " Delores struggled to sound pleasant and sincere in the face of the businessman 's wrath . You 'd think he was here on Kya , she mused , not safely back on Earth . " I ca n't discuss the war . " " What war ? " the man demanded . " Those monsters have taken half of Kya without a fight ! All the kya do is pull back , go home and graze . And I do n't see the UN doing a damned thing to protect my investments ! " Delores ordered herself to be patient . " Sir , the UN is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and broke the connection . " Jerk , " Delores muttered . She was fed up with calls from people who thought that the war existed to inconvenience them and that the UN embassy could make it all go away . As the embassy 's operations officer-a fancy title for girl Friday , she reflected-such things went with the job . Liking such things was another matter . She looked at the map on the lobby wall . It was n't true that the aliens occupied half of Kya . The latest reports said they held about ten thousand square kilometers of desert land near the equator , marked on the map as a crosshatched circle a hundred klicks in diameter . What they did in those lands was anyone 's guess ; the aliens vaporized anything that approached them . The kya 's tiny army had shown the good sense to do nothing more than patrol the edge of the occupied territory . Humanity had accomplished nothing yet . Before the invaders " ship landed on Kya it blasted the satellites which the UN had placed in orbit , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down a starship that tried to enter Kya orbit , and that attack had caused the UN to cancel all further flights to Kya . The human scientists on Kya had set up an observation post outside the invasion zone , but if they had learned much about the invaders Delores did n't know about it . Security was tight . And it was none of her business , she mused . Her job was to keep the embassy running . Let the higher-ups worry about the war . Ambassador Nyquist opened his office door and peered into the lobby , looking for all the world like a nervous mouse checking for cats . " Trouble ? " he asked . " Just another call from Earth , sir , " Delores said . " A perfume importer wanted to know about the war . " " You mean he wanted to know when we 're going to break the blockade and let him start making a profit again . " Nyquist laughed in derision as Delores nodded . Then he handed her a note pad . " We may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , touched its display key and read its message . The UN had devised a plan to defeat the invaders ; details would arrive soon . The UN anticipated that it could eliminate the invaders with negligible upset to the natives and environment of Kya . Nyquist was authorized to divulge this information to the leaders of the kya overgovernment . Delores looked up from the pad and its good news . " I take it this is secret ? " " Quite , " the ambassador said . " Earth does n't think the enemy can intercept our tachyon laser , so our link with home is secure . But the invaders use radio , so if the kya learn this- " " - the invaders could hear it on their broadcasts , " Delores finished . That assumed they could understand Wideplain , the major kya language , but that seemed a safe assumption . Any reasonable invaders would study their victims . " Precisely , " Nyquist said . " Arrange a briefing for the local chieftains-and their scientists , " he added . " They wo n't understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Schedule it for , oh , the day after tomorrow . " Delores nodded . Sir , when can we expect help to arrive ? " Nyquist smiled slightly . " I 'm not authorized to say-but I can say you 'll be pleasantly surprised . " He returned to his office . Delores accepted that answer and set to work , composing an invitation to kya politicians and scientists . Once that was done she carried her deskpad into the factory room , where she fed the message and the embassy 's mailing list into a nanotech duplicator . The machine extracted raw materials from its supply tanks , and a moment later it opened to reveal a pile of stamped , sealed envelopes . Delores picked them up-and found that the duplicator had fused them into a solid mass of paper . With a sigh she touched the intercom pad . " Kakuji ? I need you in here . " Kakuji Saito entered the room a moment later . " Trouble ? " the young computer technician asked . He shook his head as Delores handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked the glitches out of the system . " " You are n't the first tech this duplicator has defeated . " Delores reminded herself that Saito was relatively new ; he had landed on Kya only weeks before the invasion , and the UN had hired him straight out of college . " Call me when you have it fixed , okay ? " " I 'll only need a minute , " Saito told her . " Call me , " Delores said , biting back a comment about his optimism . Shaking her head , Delores returned to her desk , where the phone was ringing again . The call came from a London travel agent who wanted to know why the UN was trying to bankrupt him by suspending travel to Kya . It was late in the evening when Delores went home , riding her electric scooter under a mercifully cloudy sky . While Kya had a thick ozone layer , enough ultraviolet light from its energetic star got through to present Delores with a sunburn whenever she forgot to use her sunblock . The curse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fair skin were n't meant for some parts of the universe . Jan Jones did n't have that problem . Her olive complexion took well to the light-very well , Delores reflected in admiration as she parked her scooter . The statuesque sports reporter was in the front yard , pushing an imported lawn mower with the same vigor that had won her a gold medal at the " 36 Olympics . Delores " assignment to Kya had seemed like a hardship duty , before Jan 's arrival had brought them together . Delores waited until Jan pushed the lawnmower near her . " You 're home early , " Delores said . Jan was supposed to be a third of the way around the planet , covering a bagdrag game . The kya game had a faddish popularity on Earth , and her network was cashing in on that . " They canceled the game , " Jan said . She gave the lawn mower a final push , then stopped . " Xlot'g Tech could n't make it . The college is near the invasion zone , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be helped , " Delores said . " Look , they 'll reschedule the game- " " I know , " Jan said . " That is n't the problem . The problem is that this invasion is news , I 'm the only human reporter on Kya , and the UN wo n't let me report on it ! Security , " they call it . Security for what ? " " They 're afraid the invaders could monitor your broadcasts , " Delores said . " That- " " I know , " Jan said in frustration . " I 've heard Nyquist 's lecture . Military security ! That overbearing scuzzball enjoys playing soldier-or dictator . " Jan gritted her teeth and started pushing the lawnmower again . Delores watched her move across the lawn . Jan was getting moodier every day , withdrawing into an angry gloom at her inability to get the news out . Delores had tried to pull her out of her depression , but so far her efforts had failed . If I want our marriage to last , she thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Delores was still watching Jan mow the lawn when one of the neighbors appeared . Like all kya he struck Delores as a cross between a deer and a Persian cat that walked on its hind legs-and she could n't recognize him , even though she and Jan had lived in this neighborhood for several months . She felt fortunate that kya identified one another by scent , not name ; she could fake it by greeting him with a loud sniff , a deep , appreciative sampling of his scent . " Good to scent you , too , Del , " the kya said as he padded across the grass to them . He went to the lawn mower , knelt by it and sniffed it in curiosity . Just like a cat , Delores thought in amusement . The kya had an exquisite sense of smell , and she sometimes thought the kya made more use of their noses than their eyes-or their brains . The kya finished his inspection and stood up . " Clever , you humans , " he mused . " Having heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likebut I did n't know your food processors were so big . May I ? " he added , as he reached for the clippings in the open catcher . " Go ahead , Zark , " Jan said in Wideplain . Delores knew that she and Jan spoke the language poorly ; the kya preferred to start their sentences with participial phrases . " Have all you want ; we ca n't eat it . " No ? Pity . " Zark took a handful of lawn clippings , sniffed them and ate them . His eyes gleamed . " Delicious ! Seeing you spend so much time tending the lawn , I thought it a waste of energy , but tasting it , I have to say you 're a terrific cook , Jan . " " Thanks , " Jan said . She and Delores sat down on the grass with Zark . " What 's the latest ? " He sniffed happily . " You have n't caught the scent ? With the theater com ing around tonight , the whole neighborhood 's trotting over to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Jan asked , with an enthusiasm Delores could n't share . Kya movies all struck her as art-house material : dull and incomprehensible . Zark 's muzzle twitched . " Not having scented the titles , I could n't say . But newsreels being on the schedule , the evening wo n't be a waste even if the films turn out to be stinkers . " Then he sniffed thoughtfully as he glanced at the heap of lawn clippings . " Could I take some of that ? I always get hungry during movies , and there 's never ang to eat . " " Take all you want , " Jan said . " I 'm not sure I want to go , " Delores said , after Zark sauntered off with a double handful of grass cuttings . " I 've got office work waiting- " " Let it , " Jan said . " How often do you get out ? You 're turning into a hermit like Nyquist . " Delores gave in . A short while later they were on their way to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portable screen and movie projector . Jan , who had brought along a large bag of lawn clippings , mingled with the audience as they milled on the park grass . Delores , who was interested in antique technologies , chatted with the projectionist about human and kya styles of entertainment . " A tee yatr ? " the kya repeated to Delores , as he fussed with his equipment . His muzzle twitched in curiosity . " Saying that , you mean something like a building , do n't you ? " " Yes , with a roof and all that , " Delores said , glancing up at the sky . It was overcast , and promised to rain . " Not only could you keep dry , but it 's always dark inside a theater . You could show films during the day and make more money . " " Something to that , " the kya said with a thoughtful sniff . " But , buildings being big and heavy , how could I carry one around with me ? " " You would n't , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The projectionist let out a baffled gronk . " Why would I want to do that ? " " Never mind , " Delores said in resignation . The kya had developed cities and buildings out of necessity , but the notion of settling down in one spot did n't sit well with their migratory instincts . Territoriality , a xenologist had once told her , was a form of behavior which the kya displayed only in the violent wards of their mental institutions . Seeing that the projectionist was ready to start the show , Delores moved off to join Jan , who stood at the edge of the crowd . " Standing room only , " Jan commented , nodding at the kya . In the darkness , the crouching , huddled audience looked more like a herd of deer than anything else . They kept jostling around , seemingly uneasy at staying on one spot for more than a moment . Delores noted that Jan seemed a little more relaxed than before . A night out seemed to be just what she needed . Static roared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the screen : a newsreel . It started with a map that showed the area held by the invaders , with arrows to show the movement of refugees away from the occupied zone . Shots of refugees followed that , while a narrator described the overgovernment , s efforts to ease their problems . The unseen kya 's words made it sound as though the invasion barely counted as a nuisance . The next scenes showed that the kya took the invasion seriously . The audience snuffled in approval as they saw a squad of soldiers patrol the edge of the invasion zone , single-shot rifles in their hands . The camera panned to a kya whose cloak bore the symbols of a high-ranking military man-or woman , Delores mused ; she still had n't figured out how to tell the difference between kya sexes . Male or female , the leader spoke with obvious confidence . " We now have the- " he made a disgusted exhaling sound , the Wideplain equivalent of a name for the invaders " - totally surrounded . Doing that , they can see the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defend ourselves . " " Saying that , you expect to win , " a reporter 's voice said from off-camera . " Correct , " the leader said . " Being more determined than the- " disgusted exhalation " - are , we 've got this war run into the ground . " " I hope the invaders understand that , " Delores muttered . The kya saw warfare as a symbolic thing , in which two herds faced one another and postured until one side or the other backed down . It was nothing like the human view of war-or , Delores suspected , like the invaders " view . She glanced up at Jan . The flickering light of the screen showed that Jan 's frustration had returned in full force . " You did n't tell me ? " The bed creaked as Jan rose up on one elbow . The bright morning sunlight that came through the bedroom window seemed to make her dark face burn with anger . " Help is coming , and you did n't tell me ? " " That 's part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kick herself Of all the secrets she could have let slip , why this one ? " Look , when we tied the knot I told you I could n't discuss everything I did , especially because- " - because I 'm a reporter , and there 's a war on , ' " Jan said in chagrin . " I know . Loose lips sink ships . I like old movies , too . " She sat up , pulling away from Delores . " But you could have told me . Damn it , we 're married . " Delores felt hurt by her angry tone . al thought it would be easier for you . " " Not having to sit on a secret I ca n't report ? " Jan was silent for a moment . Then she lay down again . " Yeah , maybe you 're right . I 'm some reporter , " she went on , as she stared up at the ceiling . " There 's a war going on and the people back home should know about it . Instead I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kya newsreel reporter cover the war-and doing a bad job of it-must have been the last straw . " I thought you liked your job . " I do , but I like the kya more . " " Well , so do I , " Delores said . " No , you just tolerate them , " Jan said . " You spend all your time in the embassy or in the house . You 're hardly ever around them- " " I see plenty of them at the embassy ! " Delores protested . " And I like them . " " Name five of our neighbors , Jan persisted . Delores said nothing . " Did you know that Zark is a biologist at Vrekle University ? How many kids are there in the neighborhood ? Who 's the alpha ? " " The what ? " Delores asked blankly . " The dominant male in the local herd , " Jan said . " The chief bull . God , Del , it 's how they reproduce . They all have sex , but when a lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neighborhood . Most of the kids you see around here have the same father . " That left Delores baffled . " I thoughtit looks like they have families- " " Just like us ? Sure , they live in houses , with one fellow living with one lady . But that 's only partly love . It 's also herd behavior , a childless fellow helping to take care of the herd 's progeny . You did n't know ? " " No , " Delores admitted . " You know I spend most of my time dealing with humans-mostly ones who want to cheat the kya on a business deal . I 'm too busy protecting them to get to know them . " " How can you protect them when you do n't understand them ? " Jan asked . When Delores said nothing Jan pressed on . " I 'm around the kya a lot more than you are . I talk to them . I go to parties after games , and meet the players " friends and families . I want the people back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got to admire the way they 're bearing up under the invasion . There 's no panic , no disorder , no profiteers ripping off the refugees . They deserve to have their story told . " She 's going native , Delores thought . The UN had warned her against that when they had trained her . Her job was to look out for Earth 's interests , not Kya 's . That was a basic fact of all diplomacy . . . and it was putting a strain on her marriage . " I 'll talk to the ambassador again , " Delores said . " Now that help 's coming they wo n't have a reason to keep a lid on everything . They 're going to need someone to report on the action . " " You think so ? " Jan asked . Delores managed a laugh . " Heroic Earthlings battling evil alien invaders ? The politicians are going to demand coverage . " That thought mollified Jan , who gave Delores a kiss . With peace restored in her home , Delores realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violate any orders his superiors gave him . He was n't the sort of man who played games to advance his own career ; she knew he was dedicated to the UN . Which was a fine thing , she thought , if she could turn it to Jan 's advantage . That was the problem that Delores mulled over as she rode her electric scooter to the embassy that morning . When she got there she was surprised to find hundreds of kya packing the street in front of the embassy . She parked her scooter against the embassy 's perimeter wall and pushed her way through them to the main gate . " Del ! " one said as she reached the gate . Delores stopped and looked up at the kya who had called her name . His voice sounded familiar . " Zark ? " she guessed . He gave her a polite sniff that was almost lost in the gronking , rumbling noises of the crowd . " Having heard rumors about some good news , I got here early . Good to be at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , can you tell us anything about the briefing ? " " The ambassador will do that , " Delores said . The gate recognized her and let her in , and she hurried across the compound to the main building . The ambassador sat behind his desk , and he looked annoyed as Delores entered his office . " I might have guessed , " Nyquist said in resignation . " Tell one of them , and you tell the whole damned herd . We must have every scientist and politician in the province out there . " Delores nodded . " The question is , what do we tell them now ? " " The truth , " he said , and grimaced . " Or at least , as much of it as they can handle ; Earth has authorized that . I 'll brief them now . Tell the auditorium to get itself on-line , and bring them in . " " Yes , sir . There 's something else , sir . " He looked up at her . " What ? " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events , " Delores said . " The UN will want people to see how well they 've handled things here " - and you know the perfect reporter for the job , " Nyquist concluded . " It would n't hurt to get things set up in advance , " Delores said . " It 's against regulations , " he muttered . Then he scowled as though struck by an unpleasant thought . " But it 's also sensible . I 'll discuss this with Earth . Now get moving . " The auditorium was a large chamber which served many functions-banquet hall , entertainment center , reception area , even gymnasium-and Delores spent her time directing its computers to set it up for several hundred kya guests . Microbots reworked the floor and walls , creating seats to accommodate kya posteriors and a podium for their human hosts . As the kya crowded into the auditorium they ignored the seats at first , and Delores watched them jostle one another for positions close to the podium . There was nothing rough or violent about the way they behaved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kya chose for leaders . Nyquist seemed to entertain similar thoughts . He looked at the crowd after he joined Delores on the podium , and he spoke into her ear . " Did you know they 're all male ? " " Kya are sexist ? " That surprised her " I thought " - they were more sophisticated than that ? " Nyquist chuckled . It 's herd psychology . The alpha males run everything . They 're the ones doing all the pushing , to establish who 's the top alpha . " " I thought they were just being rude . " " More like childish . They 're lucky we 're here to save them . " The ambassador shook his head in amusement and stepped up to the microphone . " Earth has authorized me to make this announcement , " he said , and as his voice boomed through the auditorium the kya stopped jostling one another and looked up to him . " The first phase of help has been received here . Our staff is now assessing the situation , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will remove the invaders from your planet . We anticipate applying our military force in five days . " Delores tried not to look puzzled . She wanted to ask Nyquist what he meant , but one of the kya in the front row saved her the embarrassment of interrupting her boss . " Talking , you say help has been received , ' " the kya said . " Having checked , I know that no human ships have landed here since the invasion . " " Help did n't come on a ship , " Nyquist said . " That would be a very sloppy way to make war , would n't it ? All the help we need has been sent by tachyon radio in the form of computer blueprints and programs . Our microbot assemblers will take this data and use it to build weapons here . " Sniffing sounds came from the crowd , which made Delores wonder if they were trying to judge that claim by its odor . " Doing this , will you supply the weapons to our soldiers ? " another kya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nyquist said . " They 're fully automated . They 'll destroy the enemy in whatever way seems least likely to harm your planet and people . We 'll probably use a biological agent , one tailored to attack only the invaders . Our genetic-engineering techniques are more than good enough to do that . We could change their genetic code slightly , so that their offspring become non-viable or lose the urge to reproduce-well , there are many things we can try . " " Planning this , do you know enough about the- " disgusted exhalation " - to consider your weapons reliable against them ? " the same kya asked . " Yes , " Nyquist said . " Our scientists have made detailed observations of the invaders . Now that is all I am authorized to tell you at this time . " He turned toward the podium 's steps . " Saying this , you 've overlooked a vital question , " a kya gronked out from the rear of the auditorium . " Planning this operation , is it wise to destroy thedisgusted exhalation " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and exhaled in a kya gesture of contempt , as if trying to clear the kya 's odor from his nostrils . Then Nyquist spoke as if to a backward child . " No one has managed to communicate with the enemy . They 've ignored our signals . Their only interest appears to be in conquering your planet-all of it , " he finished . " Saying this , can you prove it ? " the kya said . Delores realized it was Zark . " Observing your scientists , we know that none have entered the occupied area- " " It 's too dangerous , " Nyquist said . " We ca n't risk losing any of our scientists on some wild venture . Besides , our remote-sensing gear makes that unnecessary . " Zark stated to say somrthing , but this words were lost in angry gronks and exhalations from the crowd . Nyquist left the podium and exited the auditorium through its rer door , leaving Delores with the crows . Most of the kya were already on their feet , and the noise in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbed off the podium and pushed her way through the crowd to where Zark stood . He greeted her with a bemused sniff . " Talking , I seem to have sneezed out a real stink , have n't I ? " he asked . " Being part of the embassy , can you tell me anything about the war plans , or have n't you been authorized to say anything ? " " I have n't even been told anything , " she admitted . Another kya broke in on them . " Saying that , it can only be because there 's nothing important to tell you , " he said . " Followers needing to know where they 're going , your leader would have told you everything important , true ? " Delores thought Zark looked pained by that . " Humans being alien , we ca n't always expect them to act like us , he said . " Sneeze on that ! " another kya said . " And sneeze on your theories , Zark ! With the- " disgusted exhalation " - acting as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no reason other than taking all this world ! " " Saying that , you 're only describing one possible theory , " Zark insisted . " Acting as they do , the- " disgusted exhalation " - might not be part of an invasion , but something quite different . A survey party , a diplomatic delegation , tourists , land-sculpting artists for all I know . That being possible , we should move cautiously until we have more facts . " More kya joined them , jostling Delores as they crowded around her and Zark . " Behaving as they do , they can only be invaders , " one of the newcomers said . " Annoying the ambassador , you risk losing our only chance of survival . " " Yes ! " another kya said . " Coming here , it is the invaders " obligation to explain their actions ! " Herd animals , Delores thought in annoyance . She might not be an expert , but she could see that they were trying to overwhelm Zark and bring him into line with everyone else . Hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even as the arguments turned into an incoherent roar of angry voices she could see that Zark refused to change his mind . Jan chuckled when Delores described the scene to her that evening . " Our neighbor , the mad scientist , " she said , twirling her fork in her spaghetti . " I would n't call Zark mad , " Delores said . " Just pissed off . He thinks he 's right , but no one will listen to him . " Including that meatball of an ambassador ? " Jan speared one of the meatballs on her plate , emphasizing her opinion of Nyquist . " You know we 're not defending this planet just to be nice to the kya . " " Meaning what ? " Delores said . " Meaning that military help is expensive , " Jan said . " Even when all we 're doing is using cheap robots , it still costs money . Somebody has to design the robots , program them , plan how to use them- " She shook her head . " I wonder if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Maybe the UN is doing this because it 's right , " Delores said . Jan reached out and patted her hand . " Del , you 'd do something because it 's right , but these are politicians . If their motives are good , why are n't they telling you everything ? And there are human scientists on Kya . Why were n't any of them at the briefing ? Why was n't I invited ? " " It was staged in a hurry , " Del said . " We were going to have it a few days from now , but when all those kya showed up the ambassador had to reschedule it to keep rumors from spreading . " " That does n't explain why no humans were invited to the original conference , " Jan said . " Or why Nyquist did n't wait an hour or so to bring some of our people in . People who could have given the kya some real answers . Something 's wrong here . " Delores did n't want to believe that , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nyquist hear you say anything like that , " she said . " Credit me with some sense , Jan said . She took a bite of spaghetti , then got up to answer a knock at the door . It was Zar , who came in at her invitation . " What brings you here ? " Jan asked him . " Having a plan , I need a favor , " he said . The twitching of his muzzle made Delores think he felt nervous . " Having whiffed enough gripes from my colleagues , I 'm putting together an expedition over the invasion zone . " " An " expedition ' ? " Delores asked . " Perfectly safe , " Zark said . He followed them into the house 's front room , where he awkwardly seated himself on the arm of a chair . " Flying high , several planes have passed over the zone unharmed . " " And a lot more have vanished , " Jan said as she sat on the couch with Delores . " Vanishing as they did , they got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're taking along the best observation gear we can find-cameras , binoculars , and so on . Doing this , our main problem is communication . Our airborne radios , being unreliable and short-ranged , I wanted to borrow one of your radiotelephones to send our reports home . " In case he does n't come back , Delores thought . " Why are you doing this ? " she asked . " Going , I want to learn about these aliens , " he said . " With everyone planning to destroy them , I think everyone is making a mistake . Behaving as they do , the- " disgusted exhalation " - could be other things besides invaders . " " He 's got a point , Del , " Jan said . " What if the aliens are here as a diplomatic team , like you ? " " In which case destroying them would be a blunder , " Delores said . She leaned against Jan , but the physical comfort she took from that did nothing to ease the uncertainty she felt . " But maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have reconnaissance robots in those plans Earth sent us ; nobody attacks without studying the enemy first . If there 's a good reason not to fight , we 'll find it . " " Hearing that , I hope you 're right , " Zark said . His muzzle had been twitching all along ; now he shuddered . " But . . . having doubts . . . still- " He shuddered again , and Del wondered if he was going to get sick . " Zark , " Jan said , " all we ate for dinner was vegetables and processed chemicals . It only smells like real meat . " Even so she got up off the couch and opened the living room window , letting in fresh air . Zark let his breath out . " Knowing that you 're aliens , I still have trouble adapting to that . That being so , it 's another reason for me to go on this expedition , rather than rely on your reports . " Jan nodded . " You might notice something our scientists missed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We can do that . " We can do better than that , " Jan said . " I 'm going with you . " " I think you married a crazy woman , " Nyquist said , when Delores reported to him in his office the next morning . He looked at her over his cup of tea . " Ca n't you talk her out of this ? " Delores managed a weak smile . " This is.Jan , sir . I ca n't get her to reboot her sanity software . " I know . " He sipped his tea , then put the cup aside . " And I know her type . Stubborn and eager for a good story . She thinks there 's something suspicious going on here , does n't she ? What with all the secrecy ? " Delores hesitated ; she did n't want to voice all of Jan 's suspicions . . . especially as those suspicions had raised doubts of her own . " She thinks we 're taking this chance to test new weapons here . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , " Nyquist said . " Earth has n't fought a major war in twenty years , so all our tested military technologies are obsolete . And who knows what we 're facing with these aliens ? Our observations say they 're small creatures , but we have no details . It 's better to try out weapons and tactics here than on Earth . It sounds cynical , but it 's the truth . " Delores felt relieved to hear that . " It 's a good reason for secrecy , " she said . " Pragmatism never plays well with the voters , " Nyquist said , " even when they benefit from it . " He turned his head as the office door opened . Saito , the computer specialist , poked his head through the doorway . " What is it ? " Nyquist asked him . " I 've finished the preliminary work with the software Earth sent , sir , " the young man said . " All of the blueprints run in the assemblers . " " Good , " Nyquist said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robot spies , the ones we discussed last night . " " Yes , sir . " Saito went away . Nyquist returned his attention to Delores . " I talked with Earth about your suggestion last night , " he said . " They 've approved it . " " Thank you , sir . " Not so fast . First , Jan can record anything she wants , but she ca n't broadcast anything without my approval . Second , I expect you to keep her under control . Make sure she does n't " accidentally " broadcast something to Earth , or editorialize about our motives . " " Yes , sir . " " Good . " He picked up his tea cup and took a sip . " You want to accompany her , do n't you ? " Delores nodded . " If Jan 's going- " " You want to be with her . Very well . I can justify that as part of your duties as operations officer . " " Thank you sir . I think , " she added honestly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invasion zone . " My pleasure , " Nyquist said . " As long as you 're going , I want you to take some of Saito 's robots . Just do n't let this Zark fellow get you into trouble . " He picked up a paper on his desk and looked at it . " Zark has a reputation as a maverick , which is n't a good thing among herd creatures . Too impulsive to become an alpha , too contrary to settle down as a follower , too impressed with himself to admit when he 's wrong-does n't even have a mate . " Nyquist set the paper aside and looked at her . " Do n't let him drag you into trouble . Now get going . " Delores left Nyquist 's office and went to the embassy 's factory room . Saito was at work there , monitoring an assembler as it constructed a robot . " Are the robots ready ? " she asked . Saito answered without looking away from his terminal . " Uh-huh . That box in the corner . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case and started to open it . " How do I-Jesus ! " She jumped back and dropped it , and stepped back even further as a dozen tarantulas and scorpions fell to the floor . She grabbed an instruction manual from a table and prepared to swat the nearest creature . " Hey , careful ! " Saito said . He took the case and started picking up the creatures . " They 're harmless . " Delores felt foolish and angry at the same time . Large , poisonous bugs did not appear on her list of favorite things . " They 're robots ? " she asked . " Spy , uh , spybots . " Saito seemed as nervous as Delores felt ; she guessed she was n't the only one who felt squeamish around crawly things . " The instructions said they used models like these for reconnaissance and point-sabotage in the Sand War . Visual surveillance , IR , radio , audio , I forget what else . They do n't blend in here , but maybe the invaders wo n't realize that . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which waved its pincers and stinger at her . The overly-realistic creature made her queasy , but she could see that its head wore a cluster of tiny lenses and antennae . " How do I use these things ? " she asked . " Easy , " Saito said . " You 're flying over the invasion zone . They 're light enough to fall a dozen klicks without breaking , so all you do is open the box and toss them out of the plane . " By noon the only thing Delores had tossed out of the plane was her breakfast . Zark had rented a wood-and-fabric contraption with two wings , one motor and no safety systems . Its pilot , a kya named Aur , sat in the front of the cabin and guided her plane by pushing and pulling rods , pedals and knobs . It worked , but Delores found that the vehicle swayed through the air as if seeking out every downdraft and crosswind in the sky . The quivering of the engine only added to the lurching and shuddering of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squeezed her eyes shut . Jan , who sat next to her in the cramped cabin , leaned over and spoke into her ear . " You okay ? " " Never better , " Delores muttered . She glanced around the cabin , which sported several empty seats . " Bet I know why Zark 's colleagues chickened out , " she said . Jan shook her head . " Kya do n't get airsick . They stayed home because , uh . . Zark looked over his shoulder and snorted in laughter . " Because being sensible , they do n't want my insane scent to rub off on them . " Zark snorted again and pointed out a window . Delores looked and saw the edge of the invasion zone two kilometers below the plane . The border was marked by a crude fence of barbed wire and a path beaten out by kya military patrols . Rich green grass covered the rolling land on the kya side of the border . On the other side A belt of dead ground marked out the edge of the invasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rustcolored vegetation here and there , gradually thickening towards the interior of the zone . She thought she saw things moving around down there , but she knew it had to be her imagination . The invaders were too small to see from this height . Jan and Zark went to work as they crossed over the invasion zone . Jan opened a window and poked her camera out through it , while the kya scientist peered through binoculars , jotted notes on a paper pad and fussed with his own camera-a box which used a lens to record a few images on silver-nitrate film . Up front , Aur worked her controls and kept the plane more-or-less on a steady course as its engine roared away . Far below , the alien vegetation became thicker , and Delores felt certain she saw movement on the ground . Time to drop the spybots , she told herself . She had dreaded this moment . Not only did the spybots look like scorpions and tarantulas , but Saito had told her that they carried real venom in their stingers , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was on their side . She twisted around and reached for the carrying case , which she had placed between the rear of her seat and the cabin 's aft bulkhead . Pop-pk-pk-pk-pk-pk-pk-pk pk pk-hssssss . . . " Aw , snort , " the pilot said as the engine sputtered and died . Air whistled around guy wires as the plane glided along . Delores watched Aur fuss with her controls , but the engine stayed dead . At last the pilot looked over her shoulder and spoke to her passengers . " What with the engine belching up like this , we 're going to land . " " Here ? " Delores asked . Aur snuffled in dry amusement . " Not knowing how to land on clouds , I can tell you it 's here or nothing . The ground looking smooth up ahead , there wo n't be a problem . " Sure , no problem , Delores thought as the plane sped toward the ground . The machine made a good glider , but she wondered if there was any point in making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Aur worked her controls with obvious expertise , but the plane still touched down with a jolt that made its wooden struts creak . It bounced wildly across the uneven land as it rolled to a halt . As soon as the plane stopped , the pilot swung open the glass bubble atop her cockpit , grabbed a tool kit and climbed out . Delores took the case and exited the plane through its rear hatch . As she stepped into the hot noonday sun she looked around . The plane had come to a rest on a patch of bare dirt , but much of the nearby ground was covered with high , rust-colored grass that was broken by clumps of red and brown bushes with spiky leaves . She saw a river in the distance , and a jumbled hill of boulders about a kilometer away , but there was nothing nearby . The silence seemed more unsettling than any noise . Then Delores heard scraping , skittering sounds at her feet . She let out a yelp as she looked down . There was a ragged hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were dropping out through it . They raced away from the plane , and as Delores tossed aside the case they vanished into the rusty grass . " Weird , " Jan said , as she checked her pocket computer . " The map says there 's a tin mine in the area . " " You 're sure ? " Delores asked her . I do n't see anything . " " Yeah . " Jan pointed to the hill . " That 's dirt and rubble from the mine . The invaders have demolished everything else . " Zark joined them , binoculars in his hands . " Looking around , I ca n't even find a road , " he said . " Roads being convenient , and being well-placed for surface transport , you 'd expect the- " disgusted exhalation " - to at least keep them . " " Maybe they do n't need roads , " Jan suggested . " Maybe their vehicles use antigravity , or maybe they have teleportation. " uI wish we had that , " Delores said . She wiped away sweat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plane was in flight , but down on the ground it was unpleasantly hot . She walked to the front of the plane and got in the machine 's shadow . She got out her phone card and called the embassy . Nothing happened , even though the embassy 's phone system was supposed to have unlimited range . She decided that the aliens were jamming communications , and she put her phone back in her hip pocket . Aur had opened the engine cowling and was hammering away at the mass of iron beneath the panels . As Delores watched , the pilot stopped working and stepped back from the machine . " Swamp gas , " she grumbled in disgust . " What ? " Delores asked . Aur gestured at the engine . " Having clean edges , it looks like the fuel line has been cut , " she said . " The mnog must have shot us with something . " She wrinkled her nose . " Gasoline smelling this bad , I wish we could use alcohol in airplanes . " Delores got up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried the strong odor of gasoline , and she saw fuel drip from a severed copper tube . . . and , in the firewall behind the engine , she saw a ragged hole . Like the tube , the hole 's edges looked freshly cut . Just like the hole in the case , she thought uneasily . The spybots were designed to commit sabotage , when the opportunity arose ; she wondered if Saito had forgot to remove that talent from their programming . " Can you fix it ? " Delores asked , as Jan joined her . " Having no choice , I can , " Aur said . " Better hurry , " Jan said in a strained voice . " We have company . " Delores turned around and saw movement in the rust-red grass . Creatures the size and shape of corn cobs began to emerge from the grass 's edge , dozens at first , then hundreds , then thousands . " Like a swarm of ants , " Jan said as she fixed her camera on them . More like bees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ringing their lengths , faceted eyes , and what looked like stingers in their tails . The comparison ended there . Pincers waved at the corners of their mouths , bristles covered their eight legs , and many of them carried small silver objects on their backs . Light flashed and the plane shuddered as part of a wing vanished . Aur let out an angry gronk and threw a wrench at them , and it crushed one of the aliens as it smashed into the creature . Aur should have brought along a hardware store , Delores thought as another section of the plane vanished . One wrench was n't enough . " Anyone wanting to stay alive , move around ! Zark said . Move , move , move ! " When Delores hesitated , Aur grabbed her arm and pulled her along . Must be herd instinct , Delores thought : run like hell when there 's trouble . It might have worked when the kya 's ancestors were fleeing carnivores , but it accomplished nothing now ; the aliens surrounded the airplane , forcing Delores and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and again , and chunks of the flying machine vanished . The aliens formed a thick ring around the plane , but as Delores jogged along she saw that the land beyond them was open . The only problem would be in reaching that ground-maybe . " How much fuel is in the tank ? " she panted to Aur . " Lots , " the pilot said . Why ? " There was no time to answer . Delores broke away from Aur , and peeled off her shirt as she went to the engine . She reached inside , grabbed the broken fuel pipe and twisted it down . Fuel gushed out , and she held her shirt under it while Jan shouted at her to keep moving . Right , she thought , as more sections of airplane vanished . She moved away from it as part of the landing gear disintegrated , and she hoped her shirt had sopped up enough fuel . " Come on ! " she shouted , and moved towards the aliens , holding the soaked shirt in front of her . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , or shoot her , but as the gas-soaked shirt neared them they scurried away , repelled by the stink of petroleum products . The gasoline forced a gap in the alien swarm , and the others followed Delores through the opening . Then they were past the aliens , and Delores turned back to look at the aliens as they swarmed around the plane . There was something orderly about the way they moved . It puzzled her ; the bugs should have scrambled to get away from the gas . Jan came up next to her . " Good thinking , " she said . " Thanks , " Delores said as she stared at the aliens . She took Jan 's camera from her and began to record the scene . The aliens looked as if they were performing a complex dance . Something about that nagged at her , as though she were seeing something she should have recognized . Jan seemed ready to explode . " You little lunatic , what are you doing ? " she shouted as one of the airplane 's wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute , " Delores said . She spotted Zark through the viewfinder and recorded him as he knelt at the edge of the swarm , picked up something and stuffed it into a rucksack . Jan swore , grabbed Delores and slung her over her shoulder . Delores kept recording the swarm while Jan dashed away with her . She pushed the camera 's zoom function , and then was annoyed when a greasy fireball covered the scene . She looked up from the viewfinder and saw that the plane had exploded in flame , wiping out the aliens . Delores looked around . There were swarms of aliens scattered across the ground . Jan and the kya were running toward a low , rough hill . Despite her burden Jan kept a good pace , and Delores thought they reached the base of the hill in record time . Jan set Delores on her feet , and the four crash survivors started climbing the hill . Its top was cluttered with large boulders , and they sat in the shade of one . Zark set the rucksack at his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to scent the aliens this well , " he said . " And , scenting what we have , it all suggests the mnog are insects . " " ' Mnog ' ? " Delores repeated . Aur sniffed in agreement . " Seeing them , you have to agree that mnog is a more appropriate name for them than- " disgusted exhalation " - true ? " " No , I do n't have to agree , " Delores said . " What does the word mean ? " " It 's this word children use , " Zark said . " Mnog'rkstvo is what you call it when they all go running around in the same direction , like our visitors do . Children shorten it to " mnog " because it 's easier to pronounce , and- " " A children 's word , " Delores said in disbelief . Despite all the destruction Zark did n't seem to take the invaders seriously . " I ca n't pronounce it , either , " Jan said . " Anyway , what makes you think they 're insects ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in amusement . " Observing the mnog , I noted their faceted eyes . Us ing faceted eyes , they ca n't have complex neural systems as do higher forms of life ; complex brains demand excellent eyes . Throwing that wrench at them , Aur showed that they have poor reflexes , poor eyesight , perhaps a poor visual image of the world . " " Is that why you made us run in circles ? " Delores asked . " You figured they could n't see a moving target well enough to shoot it ? " Zark sniffed in agreement . " Being lucky , I made a good guess , " he said . Delores nodded at that , although she realized he was being modest . Under the circumstances , his idea had amounted to a stroke of genius . " What do we do next ? " she asked . " That being a good question , I think we should discuss it , " Aur said . " What 's to discuss ? " Delores asked . " We want to get out of here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nog . Zark , you 're the only scientist we have . You 'd better take over . " Aur gave a sniff of agreement , and Delores nodded . " Looks like you 're the leader of the herd , " Jan said . " Saying that , you 're quite generous , " Zark said . He held onto the rucksack as he stood up and looked around . " The ground being bad here , we should be safe . Mine and smelting wastes being mildly toxic , the mnog should ignore this ground . " Delores did n't like the sound of that . " How toxic is " mildly " toxic ? " she asked . " Years of rain having scrubbed this ground , it 's just bad enough to keep plants from growing , " Zark said . " Being here , we may as well observe the mnog in action . Then , the mnog being what logic says they are , we wait until it gets dark . " " If your logic is right , " Delores said . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag ? " " Mnog , " he said , and opened it . Delores glanced inside , and looked away at the sight of several dead insects . " The gas having killed these , I thought it would be a good idea to run home with some specimens . " Once the sun went down the hot , clear day turned into a cold , clear night . Delores spent her time huddled with Jan , and wished she 'd used something other than her shirt as mnog-repellent . Jan had given her the shirt off her back , but while it had shielded her from the worst of the sun it did little now to keep her warm . Zark had taken Jan 's camera almost at once , and spent the day taping the mnog . The creatures stayed clear of the hill , but the camera 's zoom and image-enhancement functions let the scientist see all he wanted . The mog roamed the landscape in great swarms , sometimes merging together and separating again , sometimes moving large distances as though migrating . They ate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rusty plant life had begun to sprout again in the stripped paths . When the sun set Jan showed Zark how to use the camera 's infrared vision , and he continued his work . He gronked quietly to himself , but after a while he gave up and joined Aur and the two humans . " Observing the mnog , I 've noted an impossibility about them , " he said . " Having such small heads and bodies , how can they be intelligent ? " " Maybe they have a hive mind , " Delores said . She had meant that as sarcasm , but that failed almost at once . Zark was n't exactly a primitive . . . and she did n't have a good answer for his question . Zark did n't know that . " Hive mind ' ? " he repeated . " It 's an old idea , " Jan told him . " Instead of having a brain that 's made up of many cells inside one body , you have a mind where many bodies each act like cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder how it would work ? " Zark mused . " Radio ? Nerve links between the bodies ? Having studied hives , I ca n't see how these individuals could form a mind . Interesting . " " What 's interesting is how we 'll get out of here , " Delores said . The last of the day 's heat had fled into the clear night sky , and she was shivering . That took her mind off being hungry , thirsty and sunburned , but she did n't count it as an improvement . " The night being cold , we could start now , " Zark said . He picked up the rucksack with the dead mnog and slung it over his shoulder . " Watching the mnog on infrared , I 've seen the swarms slow down , suggesting they 're cold-blooded . All of us being faster , I think we can elude any swarm that notices us . " Delores hoped that he was right . " Where do we go ? " she asked , as Zark started to lead them down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the river , " Zark said . " Heading south as it does , it will lead us to edge of mnog territory . Getting that far , we walk into the water as deep as we can- " Aur let out a horrified gronk at that " - and try to get out unobserved . Inert objects having floated out of this area in the river , it seems the mnog have limits on what they attack . " " Makes sense , " Jan said . " The mnog need to keep things out , not in . " Delores thought the reasoning was bad , but she had no time or energy to spare for that . The night was so dark that her surroundings were reduced to vague , dark blurs . Zark led the way , using the viewfinder and IR setting of Jan 's camera for night vision-and using his nose . Several times Delores heard him stop and sniff the air , and then change directions when he caught the odor of a mnog swarm . True to Zark 's word , none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the alien presence , however . Alien plants grew everywhere , and several times they passed large masses of a gelatinous substance which covered the ground . " Eggs , " Zark said , when he paused to examine one mass . " Small eggs . The eggs being this small , the mnog must hatch underdeveloped . " Jan bent to peer at the clutch of eggs . " A whole lot of eggs . The queen must be huge . " " We have n't seen any big bugs , " Delores said . She kept her voice down . " And who says they 've got to have a queen ? " " That 's true , " Zark answered . " And , sniffing around , I 've noted that the eggs have different scents , as though layed by many different females . That being so , it implies the mnog have no queen , no central hierarchy . " " Which would make the mnog harder to exterminate , Jan said . " Worse , " Aur said . " The eggs being so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 'll take more area soon . " " Which means we 'd better warn everyone , " Delores said . " Let 's go . " The going became easier when they reached the river ; its banks were sandy and free of obstructions , and the faster pace allowed Delores to warm up . The trouble was that a faster pace would bring them to the border that much sooner , and Delores thought the mnog would be more observant-and quicker on the draw-at the border . Dawn was glowing on the horizon when they saw the bare ground that marked the border . " Seeing that , it 's time to get in the water , " Zark said , and handed the camera and rucksack to Delores . " Being human , you can do that thing where you move around while floating in the water , ca n't you ? " Delores felt blank . " You mean swimming ' ? " She had to use the English word ; she realized she did n't know its Wideplain equivalent . " Yes . So can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want everyone to stay about fifty vults behind me , in case I 'm wrong about the mnog ignoring us . " Zark turned and waded into the river . Delores waited , then went in with Jan and Aur when the kya pilot decided Zark had gone far enough ahead of them . Delores decided that fifty vults equaled a hundred meters or so . The water felt warmer than the early dawn air , and Delores found that the current helped move her along . She held the camera and canvas sack above her head as she tried to stay shoulderdeep in the water . Starlight glinted on the water , making her feel like a target . Suddenly Zark foundered , flailed his arms and went under . Delores saw Jan spring forward at once , cross the water with the same speed she had shown in the Olympics , and vanish below the surface . She emerged with Zark a few seconds later , and kept his head up while she pulled him into shallower water . Zark wheezed and gasped for breath , then went back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizon by the time they reached friendly territory . They slogged out of the river , and Delores sat on the bank with Jan while Zark and Aur squeezed water out of their thick pelts . Delores set the rucksack aside ; she had the queasy feeling that the mnog in it were not dead . Jan eyed Zark . " He 's got guts , " she said quietly . " Uh-huh , " Delores said . " Going first to make sure the mnog would n't shoot usNot that , " Jan said as she slipped an arm around Delores " shoulders . " Getting in the water like that , and then going on after he almost drowned . Kya ca n't swim . That 's why they do n't have a word for it . " " I did n't think about that . " Delores looked at Zark . " I keep expecting him to act like a wimp . Is he really an alpha ? " Jan shook her head . " No . It 's a social thing with kya , and most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even have a mate . He could turn into an alpha ifa lot of their females started taking him seriously , but that wo n't happen . " Why the females ? " Delores asked . " Reproduction , " Jan said . " They try to choose the best possible father for their offspring , which means picking the most impressive fellow around . Which means smart , clever and sensible . That spills over into their politics-the leaders are all alphas , but they ca n't keep that status if they do n't impress the females with their brains . " " I see , " Delores said . " I . . . see , " Jan repeated . " Del , you make that sound like it means something special . " " I was just thinking about something the ambassador said , " Delores told her . He had made it sound as though the kya were driven purely by instinct , which no longer seemed true . For that matter Delores thought , Nyquist 's low opinion of Zark did n't match the kya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's spybots kept nagging at her . She knew she was going to have a lot of questions for Nyquist when she got home . A kya patrol found them not long after they emerged from the water . Zark spoke with them , and got directions to their camp . Once there he persuaded the base captain to give his group a truck , and shortly thereafter Jan was driving the vehicle down an uneven dirt road which-Zark claimed-led to the observation post set up by a team of human scientists . Delores hoped he was right ; she hated to think that the dull , jolting ride over this road might go for nothing . She sat alone in the back of the truck , which offered her shade from the scorching sun . Her exposed skin was badly sunburned , and the pain left her too dispirited to care about much . She wished Jan had left the driving to Zark , but Jan had insisted on riding up front with Zark and Aur . A sliding panel separated the rear of the truck from the cab . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 're there , " he said , and gave a thoughtful sniff . " Luck being with us , the observation post is there , too . " The truck stopped , and Delores climbed out and looked around . " There " was a cluster of small , glassy buildings , constructed by microbots out of the silicates in the soil . The UN camp stood behind a hill which screened it from the occupation zone , and a cluster of instruments atop the grassy hill seemed to watch nervously for the first sign of an alien assault . A set of antennae pointed to the opposite horizon , and the main research base far beyond it . The sight of the antenna farm reminded Delores that she should contact Ambassador Ny , quist and let him know that she was all right . When she started to pull her phone out of her hip pocket , however , she paused and slid it back . She realized that Jan 's suspicions about Nyquist did n't seem as far-fetched as she had thought . . . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good idea just yet . The scientific team was led by an aging Chinese woman with iron-gray hair . She introduced herself as Dr. Feng . " We heard about your crash , " Feng said as she led Delores and the others into the observation post 's main building . " The UN embassy reported all of you as dead . " " Saying that , they were premature , " Zark said easily . He had taken the rucksack , and he now handed it to Feng . " Being there , we brought back some dead mnog . " " ' Mnog ' ? " Feng asked . " It 's what they call the invaders , " Delores said . " And we have some pictures of them Feng did n't seem to hear her . The scientist went to the building 's door and shouted something in Mandarin , and at once the rest of her team began to crowd into the room . Zark took Jan 's camera and handed it to one of the humans . Jan spoke quietly to Delores . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't argue . They left the main building for one of the smaller structures , which looked like a small dormitory . It was , and they found a firstaid kit in its office . Jan activated it and let it work on Delores . " You should feel better in a few minutes , " she said , and sat in the chair next to hers . " Right . " The process was supposed to be painless , but she still felt discomfort as the kit infected her with a geneticallyengineered virus . She started to sweat as the virus attacked specific parts of her body , stimulating the healing and growth processes in her skin . It was better than enduring the burns and blisters , but she still felt as though she were coming down with a case of the flu . And Jan was looking at her . " You have something you want to say , do n't you ? " Delores asked . Jan nodded . " Aur noticed something odd about the engine . " " As in a cut fuel line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " Delores asked . " Right . And I looked at that carrying case . " " Which had a robot-size hole snipped in its base , " Delores said . " A hole just like the one in the engine compartment . " " Just the right size for one of those scorpion-type robots , " Jan said . " Somebody did n't want us to come back from this expedition . " Delores scowled . " Murder is n't the ambassador 's style . " " But following orders is , " Jan said . She took out a handkerchief and wiped the sweat from Delores " face . " Maybe someone told him to let us go on this expedition , and to have us take along those spybots . That same someone could have programmed the spybots to sabotage us . Nyquist might not have known , " she added . " Maybe , " Delores said . She did n't like the idea , but there were a lot of things to dislike here . " But why ? " " To keep something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishy is going on here . Did you notice how excited Feng acted when Zark said he had some dead mnog ? She 's obviously never seen one up close , which means no human scientist has gone in there- " " The UN wo n't authorize it , " Delores said . " It 's too risky . " " I do n't think either of us believe that , " Jan said . I do n't know what to believe anymore , " Delores said . She looked at her forearm and saw that her sunburn had faded back to her normal fair coloring . She felt a bit feverish from the treatment , but it was nothing she could n't endure . " There has to be a simple explanation for everything-failures to communicate , a programming defect in one of Saito 's spybots " Maybe . " Jan stood , and took her hand to help her out of her seat . " Let 's get something to eat , and find a place to sleep . Maybe Zark and Feng will have figured out something by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct . They spent the day sleeping in the dorm , and Delores woke late in the afternoon . She left Jan asleep in the bed , got a sandwich from the kitchen robot , and went off in search of the science team . They were hard at work in the central building . Delores walked down the building 's central corridor and found Zark and Feng in the biology lab , where they probed into a dissected mnog . " It 's a lot like a terrestrial insect , or its Kya equivalent , " Feng told Delores , after Delores asked her if they were making any progress . The elderly woman poked a set of electrodes into the creature as she spoke . " The internal organs and biochemistry are different , of course , but the differences do n't have anyone pulling out her hair . " Zark idly brushed at his furry shoulder . " And it 's poikilothermic , as I thought , " he said . " Porko . . . " " Delores shook her head . " You mean cold-blooded ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's sensitive to cold , just like native insects , and Terran as well . Hearing this , you can scent why I expected them to become dormant at night . Looking for a way to fight the mnog , I would say we need nothing more than a lot of snow to stop them. , " Sounds like a plan , " Delores said . She looked at the opened-up insect , which lay on its back in the dissecting tray , and then looked away . " How often do you get blizzards in this part of Kya ? Once every , what , ten million years or so ? " " About that , " Zark agreed . " That being the case , my plan does have a few minor details to work out . " " We 're not going to stop the mnog that way , " Feng said . She looked at the dissected mnog as though she were a general contemplating an enemy . " Kya does n't have enough of an axial tilt to create appreciable seasons . As near as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to keep the nog out . " Delores saw the implications . " So if we ca n't stop them , pretty soon they 'll push everyone into a couple of small areas . " " Doing that , it could get crowded , " Zark agreed . " It 's more likely they 'll destroy all of Kya 's native life , " Feng said . " A stable ecology needs a large area . Right now you could maintain the two separate systems on Kya , but that wo n't work if you confine one of them to a small area . But look at this . " She gestured at the mnog in the dissecting tray . Delores steeled herself and looked at its innards . " See these bundles ? They 're nerve trunks , one connected to each leg . This central bundle is the brain . " A woozy feeling made Delores look away from the dead creature , but she realized there was something odd about that . " Should n't that bundle be in the head ? " " Senses being important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zark said . His muzzle twitched as though something annoyed him , bu , Delores heard only scientific curiosity in his voice . " Staying close to the nose and eyes , the brain gets messages faster that way . Being set up like this , however , the legs seem more important to the mnog brain . Dissecting a leg , we 've found that each cilia attaches to a single neuron . " " Like they sense the world through touch ? " Delores asked . " Or communicate through it , " Feng suggested . " Bees tell one another where to find pollen through a type of dance . " Zark sniffed thoughtfully . " Talking with Delores earlier she suggested the mnog might have a hive mind . Considering what she said , and what we 've seen here , I wonder if thought-impulses are n't transmitted by touching the legs . With the individual mnog having such small brains , yet showing intelligence , we need some mechanism to explain their behavior . " " I do n't think that 's it , " Feng @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if to chide her for foisting such a preposterous idea on an unsuspecting alien . Delores felt her face redden with embarrassment as she recalled that she had made the suggestion for that reason . " There 's no way that the mnog could form direct synaptic connections by touching their legs . " " Maybe they do n't have to , " Delores said . Something had nagged at her ever since she had first noticed the mnog 's dance . There was something precise and mechanical about that dance-yes , that was it ; it reminded her of something she had once seen in a museum . " Maybe it 's a mechanical process , like the cams and wheels inside an old adding machine . " " Or an evolutionary development of something like this bee-dance you mentioned , " Zark mused . " Communicating , each mnog acts like a cell in a brain , or a small cluster of specialized nerves . " " No , " Feng said in annoyance . " I do n't believe it . It would make their thought processes too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-dimensional array on the ground . Our brains have a three-dimensional structure . That lets the neurons form a greater number of connections . The sort of hive-mind you propose could n't do that . " Zark sniffed , then shrugged . " Needing a theory to cover the facts , I 'm ready to follow a better explanation . " aI think they 're a tertaformation tool , " Feng said . " Somebody else created the mnog to pave the way for them . Once the mnog have finished their work-destroying the old environment and establishing a new ecology-their creators will move in . " " I do n't know , " Delores said . " If the mnog are just tools , should n't they move out of an area once they 're finished with it , and start working on something else ? We saw them swarming all over the place , eating everything in sight-and the vegetation grows back awful fast . Almost as if it was their ideal food . " " Coincidence , " Feng said , and shook her head . " Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our samples and data back to our base , where we can do some real research . " Zark seemed about to reply , but he paused and took several quick sniffs that made his muzzle twitch . " Do you scent that ? " " Scent what ? " Feng asked . Zark went to the lab door , opened it and took a deep breath . " Mnog , " he muttered . " The scent being strong , it 's as though- " He inhaled loudly , then turned around . " We have to evacuate . " He sounds awful bossy , Delores thought before she understood the urgency in his voice . " The mnog are coming ? " she asked . " Yes , " Zark said . " Spread the word , then get to the truck . " Delores hurried to the dorm , where she woke Jan . " Figures , " Jan said , after Delores hurriedly explained the situation to her . " All those eggs we saw-it figures they would n't take long to hatch . I wonder how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Probably a lot , " Delores said . She picked up the camera while Jan climbed into a set of borrowed coveralls . " The question is , how long before they get here ? " " Not long , " Jan said . " And the mnog will get here first . I do n't think they 'll ignore us this time . " Delores could n't argue with that . She followed Jan out to the borrowed kya truck , where the base 's personnel were scurrying to load equipment , samples and records into a motley assortment of vehicles . Zark , Aur and Feng were doing the same with the truck . " We have to abandon a lot , " Feng said , while Delores turned on the camera and recorded events . " There 's no time , not enough transport-you 're certain this thing will run ? " she asked Aur . " Quite certain , " Aur assured her . " Driving it herself , Jan has shown a definite flair for it . You might wish to observe her techniques while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And take the opportunity to examine some human technology , Delores thought . She shrugged off that notion . " How much time have we got ? " she asked Zark . He sniffed the air . " None , " he said . " The mnog being close , it 's time to stampede out of here . " Delores got into the truck 's cab ; Feng scrambled in through the other door . Jan sat in the center , at the controls , and started the engine . As the truck lurched away from the base Delores leaned out the window with the camera . The truck seemed to be the last vehicle out ; as she looked through the viewfinder she saw nothing but empty buildings and scattered rubbish . As she watched , a building flashed into white light and disappeared . She spotted a silver glint on the horizon and zoomed in on it , and that showed her a swarm of mnog as they demolished an instrument tower . The devices on their backs might have been tiny , but they were powerful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " she told Jan . The truck surged ahead . Delores glanced out the window and saw more glints of light on the horizon . She could n't tell how fast the mnog were moving ; she only hoped the truck was faster . " We 're faster , " Jan said when Delores asked about that . " What I want to know is , how far will the mnog come ? We may not have enough fuel to outrun them . " " Zark had some ideas about that , " Feng said . " Half of the mnog are female , and each lays a hundred eggs in a clutch , so when they hatch their population will increase by a factor of fifty . " " So they 'll need fifty times as much land , Delores said . " Which means they 'll move their border out , what , two thousand clicks ? " " No , " Feng said . " They have to extend the area 's radius by the square root of fifty . Call it four hundred kilometers . Jan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have enough alcohol to do four hundred clicks . We 'll have to refill the tank . Seen any filling stations anywhere ? " " Not yet , " Delores said . She decided to ask Zark for suggestions . She twisted around in her seat , opened the panel to the rear-then blushed and shut the panel . " Something wrong ? " Jan asked . " No , " Delores said in embarrassment . " They 're , uh , just clearing up Zark 's complexion . " Feng looked puzzled . " You ca n't say the kya have a complexion . The fur covers their entire facial . . . oh . " Jan grinned , took a hand off the truck 's tiller and patted Delores " knee . " Romance in the face of danger . You have to love it . " " Not while you 're driving ! " Delores said as the truck lurched over a massive bump in the dirt road . Kya 's blazing white sun had set by the time the truck reached the UN 's main research base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observation post , but Delores thought it looked just as starkly utilitarian as the post . Its one saving grace was that it was over a hundred kilometers from the edge of the newlyexpanded occupied zone . The UN scientists crowded around the truck as Jan parked it in front of the main building , and Delores noticed that a dozen or so kya stood among them . Several of them greeted Zark as he climbed out of the back of the truck , and Delores thought they seemed less hostile to him than the scientists she had seen at the embassy briefing . She understood that change when she saw Zark remove a container with dead mnog from the back of the truck ; the kya scientists had to be eager for their first look at the invaders . " It 's more than that , " Jan said , when Delores voiced her thoughts . Jan spoke as she recorded the scene with her camera . " A kya scientist found those specimens , which is more than our scientists have done . " Delores nodded . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care if it was Zark . " " You might say that . " " I just did . " Delores took Jan by the elbow and steered her away from the crowd . Let 's find a computer someplace . " " What have you got in mind ? " " Let 's say that the mnog have a hive mind , " Delores said , as they walked toward one of the base 's buildings . " Let 's say that the individuals act like circuit chips in an old computer , and that they communicate by dancing . Let 's say that we have some good pictures of them communicating . " She tapped Jan 's camera . " And let 's say we have no idea what they 're communicating about , " Jan said . " Not now , we do n't , " Delores said . " But if they communicate by physical means , what will you bet that a computer can find a pattern ? " " Not much , " Jan said . " Unless you know something I do n't ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's find the administration building . I need to contact the embassy . " The administration building proved to be a large dome at the center of the base . Delores found an empty office , and Jan stood behind her as Delores sat down at the office 's computer terminal . " What are you looking for ? " Jan asked , as Delores fussed with the computer . " A cryptology program . " Delores spoke as she studied the directories on the computer display . She touched her fingertip to the display , picking out the programs she wanted . " We have a lot of them . " " To spy on the kya ? " " You did n't hear that from me , " Delores said while the computer downloaded the software to her terminal . " But we also adapted them for linguistics . Translating an alien language has similarities to breaking a code . You look for patterns and meanings , and try to change them into something you can understand . " Jan looked dubious . " Human codes are based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer make sense of whatever the mnog use for a language ? " " It 's worth a try , " Delores said . " We live in the same universe , so we must have certain things in common . And I have a hunch that the mnog that swarmed around the plane were talking about it . If I 'm right , it 'll give the computer a starting point . If I 'm wrong-huh ? " The display went blank . Saito appeared in the display , and the young computer specialist looked shocked to see Delores . " You-we heard you were dead ! " he said . " You heard wrong , " Jan said , before Delores could answer . " The plane 's engine conked out and we had to walk home . Did n't your spybots keep an eye on us ? " " No , we programmed them to scatter after you released them , to , uh , look for any hive-queens . Not that we found any . I 'm glad you 're all fine , " he went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , we held a memorial service this morning . " " I 'm sorry we missed it , " Delores said . " I hope the ambassador said something nice about us ? " " Yes-look , why did n't you call us earlier ? " Saito asked . " We did n't have time , " Delores said . " Anyway , we 're fine , and Jan has a report on the invaders . We 'll send it in so Mr. Nyquist can clear it for broadcast . Talk to you later . " You son of a bitch , she thought as she broke the connection . She hoped Saito had n't seen the cold anger she felt . She did n't want to believe that someone had wanted everyone on the plane killed , but she could n't ignore the evidence . Jan was staring at the display . " Whatever happened , he was in on it , " she said . " I know , " Delores said . " The spybots can be remotely controlled . So why did n't he use them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " She held up a hand before Jan could speak . " Because we were supposed to disappear without a trace , and this way- " - the spybots would n't accidentally record a trace , ' " Jan concluded . " But why would the UN want to keep anyone from learning about the mnog ? " " Let 's find out , " Delores said . She took the camera from Jan and linked it to the terminal 's data reader , which copied the images in the camera 's memory . Then Delores looked at the cryptology programs , and tried to decide how to fit the images into their format . The programmers had written their software to cover every imaginable form of communication , including physical gestures-but as Jan had suspected , their imaginations had n't stretched quite far enough to cover the mnog . Delores thought she could make up for the difference , although proving it took much of the night . Jan brought her sandwiches and coffee while she fussed over the terminal and wished she knew more about computers . She slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have expected , and that with a few nudges the software could examine the videos and look for information . The only problem was finding enough pictures of the mnog that were clear enough to show the swarm 's activities . At last the computer started to process the videos , and Delores pushed her chair back from the terminal . " Binary , " she grumbled , while Jan stood behind her and massaged her shoulders . al kept looking for something complicated , but the damned bugs tap their legs together in binary code . You ca n't get any simpler than that . " " Sometimes simple is good , " Jan said . " It 's reliable . It 's easier to process with a computer . Hey , we 're getting something . " " Finally . " Delores sat up straight as an image filled the screen . It was distorted , but recognizable . " That 's Aur 's airplane . " " And a good picture , too , " Jan said . " The mnog must form an image by putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those little arrows ? " Her eyes widened as she leaned closer to the image . " Air flow . Lift and thrust vectors . Del , they are n't just looking at the plane , they 're thinking about how it flies . That means- " - that a scientist like Zark should see this , " Delores concluded . " Let 's get him in here . " Jan looked her over . " What have you got in mind ? " " Just a hunch . " Delores wished she could put her feelings into words . " Have you noticed how Zark has acted since the crash ? " " He 's been a little bossy , " Jan said . " Why ? " " I wonder if he 's turning into an alpha , " Delores said . " The boy 's just had three girls play follow-the-leader with him , and he 's impressed Feng-not to mention Aur . All that female attention must have an effect on him . " Jan shook her head . " It could be a start , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball rolling . " " Such as making some scientific discoveries about the mnog ? " Delores tapped the display with a fingernail . " There 's a good one right here . He can prove that the mnog have a hivesind . They are n't a terraformation tool , like Feng said ; they 're the actual terraformers . " " Why do you want to build him up ? " Jan asked . " Because we need an alpha on our side , " Delores said . " Jan , Nyquist planned on us getting killed . That 's why he announced we were dead . And that briefing he gave at the embassy-he acted more like an alpha than a diplomat . " " You mean he 's trying to dupe the kya into something . " " And whatever it is , the bastard nearly killed us over it . That sounds like a good reason to screw up his plans . " Delores hesitated . That was n't the attitude of a good career bureaucrat . On the other hand , her boss had tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new career Delores woke up in the back of a large van . After a few seconds of disorientation she realized it was speeding down a road . She recalled climbing into it last night , and thinking she would never get any rest . It surprised her that she could have slept here , but the ride was smoother than she had expected , the folded tarp more comfortable . She sat up and saw that Aur was asleep nearby , resting in a crouch atop a small sleeping pad . Zark was there as well , and he greeted Delores with a cheerful sniff . " With Jan driving like she does , we 'll reach your embassy soon , " he said . He sidled across the decking and crouched alongside her . " Thinking about the mnog , I have an idea about communicating with them . Could you build some spybots to resemble the mnog ? " " I suppose so , " Delores said . " What have you got planned ? " " Knowing how the mnog communicate , we could use the robots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of the swarm , the robots could brush legs with the creatures . " " Would that work ? " Delores wondered . " Maybe you can tap out a binary message that way , but would the mnog understand it ? " " Having considered that point , I could n't say , " Zark admitted . " Being a hive-mind , they may not have the concept of communicating with othersthey may not even realize other minds can exist . But would n't it be fascinating to learn how the mnog view themselves and the universe ? " He sniffed thoughtfully , then sneezed on the faint burnedalcohol scent of the truck 's exhaust . " Humans being a lot like us , I doubt you 're even a twelfth as alien as the nog . " He sounds like he 's bored with us , Delores thought . She smiled , showing enough teeth to remind Zark that humans were n't vegetarians . " At least we 'll be around longer than the mnog . " " That destruction thing ? " Zark asked . " Having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a need to destroy them ? " " They 've invaded your planet . " " Not the whole planet , " Zark said placidly . " Talking with them , perhaps we can negotiate an arrangement . " He looked at her and inhaled slowly , as if trying to sample her thoughts with her scent . " Having listened to the ambassador , I wonder why he seems so obsessed with this war-fighting notion . War being wasteful , it may be an evolu tionary aberration only we and humans practice . " He sounds so optimistic , Delores thought . " You 'd better get more practice , or you wo n't do much more evolving , aberrant or otherwise . " " The war going as it has , we 're doing quite nicely , " Zark said . " With their herd pushing against ours , they 're fighting our way , which we can handle . Once we find a way to push back firmly , we 'll have this settled . Doing that , we 'll have no need for violence . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she rested her back against the van 's wall she wondered if his attitude meant he was taking on the alpha role . If so , she wondered how well he could handle it . He did n't have much time for on-the-job training . Delores shook her head and told herself to stick to her own problems . Staying alive looked to be the biggest of them . Nyquist might try to kill her and Jan again . He must have acted on orders from the UN , but what reason could they have had ? And what could she do about that ? She was still mulling that over when the van rolled to a halt outside the UN embassy 's main gate . As the engine quit Delores heard the low gronking of kya , and when she climbed out of the back of the van she saw that the vehicle was surrounded by reporters . Must be a big news day , she thought as she saw their film-cameras and radio microphones . The local press always swarmed around the embassy when something happened . The mob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aur got out of the van . Delores only caught fragments of their words as they asked Zark about the crash , the mnog , his findings . She wished she could tell what the crowd thought of Zark . The scientist seemed sure of himself , as if he expected their full attention , but he had behaved that way during the briefing . Jan appeared at her side . " He 's having the time of his life . Everyone 's taking him seriously now . " " Alpha City , here he comes , " Delores said . She looked at the embassy gate . " Jan , can you run interference for me while I get to the factory room ? " " Interference ? " Jan looked puzzled for a second , then nodded as she caught the hint . " Sure . I 've always wanted to interview Nyquist . Maybe I can get some dirt on him . Or put him six feet under the dirt , Delores thought as the embassy gate opened itself for them . A pair of security men stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nod as she and Jan stepped through . She felt anything but casual . Nyquist had tried to kill her ; she wondered if the security forces knew about that . Probably not , she decided . Murder was always a dangerous game , and the more people you brought into a conspiracy , the more risk you had of something going wrong-or of somebody listening to their conscience . She hoped she was right , but she still felt uneasy as she and Jan walked across the compound and entered the main building . Jan headed for Nyquist 's office , while Delores went to the factory room . Saito was there , working at the computer console . The young man looked tired and punchy , as if he had lived the past few days on coffee and no sleep . He turned around and his face went pale as he saw her . Guilty , all right , Delores thought . " Okay , mister , explain , " she said angrily . He stood up on rubbery knees . " Explain-explain what ? " " How you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder . " She walked up to him and jabbed a finger into his chest . He was bigger than her , but he looked intimidated . " Think I ca n't guess what you tried ? And do you think Nyquist will save your weaselly ass ? " Saito looked frantic . " He said-the ambassador told me- " " - that you have diplomatic immunity ? Wrong . " Her smile showed enough teeth to frighten a kya . " You can use that to get away with trying to kill Zark and Aur-but Jan and I are n't kya . We can take you into court on Earth- " " - and have your case thrown out , " Nyquist said as he entered the factory room . " You may ignore her threats , Mr. Saito . " Delores glared at Nyquist . " Where 's Jan ? " " Security escorted her off the grounds , " Nyquist said . " She may be your spouse , but that does n't give her the right to harass me . What do you think you 're going to accomplish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was the idea , Delores thought . It still might work ; Jan had bought her just enough time to wring a confession of sorts from Saito-and the young computer specialist still looked apprehensive . " Zark does n't want to exterminate the mnog , " she said . " You say that as though it means something . " Nyquist leaned against the door frame , looking for all the world as though he were in full control . " Mnog . A word from kiddie-talk , of all things . This great native scientist thinks he can communicate with the invaders , does n't he ? " " He 's found a way to do it , " Delores said . She knew she had to keep on top of the situation . " I want you to modify some spybots to resemble the mnog . You can do that , ca n't you ? " she asked Saito . The young man nodded . " It 'll take a few hours , but - but we wo n't do that , " Nyquist told Saito . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four innocent people is , " Delores said . " Yes , " Nyquist said bluntly . " Zark and your spouse are a threat to the UN 's plans . Zark might persuade the other kya not to fight the invaders , and there goes the war , and the entire population of this planet . As for Jan , she 's determined to get a story . Her story . " " That 's her job , " Delores said . She shook her head in bewilderment . " Damn it , the UN can use all the friendly publicity it can get ! Why not let her report ? " Because we have to manage the news carefully , " Nyquist said . " This war places us in a lose-lose situation . The kya are popular on Earth . If we ca n't save them , it 's our fault for losing the warand it makes everyone wonder how well we can protect Earth from the invaders . But when we defeat the aliensyou realize we 'll have to kill all of them ? No prisoners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " That 's the decision of our best military minds , " Nyquist said . " The invaders did n't come all this way to lose a war . So we have to wipe out the invaders and their colony-which opens the UN to charges of genocide . " Delores saw the point . " And either way , the LIN is n't going to bring a crisis on itself . " " Not when it might endanger the defense of Earth , " he said . " Suppose these aliens invade while we 're playing blamegames ? I 'm sorry you got caught in the middle , but that 's how it is . And now I have to straighten out this mess , " he went on . He scowled as though thinking , then turned to Saito . " CCm YOU modify those spybot blueprints to make them resemble the invaders ? " The young man looked startled . " ITh-yes , sir . " " Get to work on it . " Nyquist looked to Delores . " We may as well let Zark try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it might prove useful . I 'll give Zark one week to get results . " " One week , " " Delores repeated . She wondered why Nyquist was giving in ; it made her suspicious . " By the way , I 'm taking a leave of absence . " Nyquist barely looked surprised . " Now ? In the middle of the war ? " Delores ignored that . " I 've accumulated several months of leave time , and you can manage without me . " Or did you think I 'd come back from the grave to run the front desk ? she wondered . Nyquist shrugged . " I suppose we will manage . No one is irreplaceable . " The week passed without results . Saito 's nanotech factory produced several hundred mnog-like robots , along with robotic aircraft which could carry them into the invasion zone . A control unit was delivered to Zark 's home , along with a computer designed to decode messages and allow communications . " Not that the mnog are communicating , " Zark told Delores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the problem is ? " Delores asked . Zark sniffed thoughtfully . " Being a hive-mind , they do n't seem to understand the notion of other minds . " " Which means they do n't know how to communicate with other minds . " " Indeed , " Zark said . " We can decipher how they think-images and symbols , so on-but what they think about is another matter . Get a whiff of that , " he said , and gestured at the computer 's video display . It showed a small patch of land in the invasion zone , where a line of robots had moved up to the edge of a mnog swarm . For a moment Delores watched the creatures rub legs with one another , but then her distaste for creatures with too many legs made her look away . Zark misread the expression on her face . " Trying various things , I 've made some progress . Sensing our messages , the swarm seems aware of something unusual . The sub-swarm we see here is contemplating a notion I translate as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch and physical movements , and upon subswarms handling small chunks of ideas , their hive-mind works very slowly . Being slow , the mnog might require many years to develop the notion of alien beings . " " I see . " Delores grimaced at that . " If the hive-mind is so damned slow , how could it have developed interstellar " Landing here , they obviously did , " " Landing " Perhaps they obviously existed unchanged for said . " Perhaps the millions og have years . Haw ing that much time , a hive-mind unchanged for millions of vears . Having that much time , even when ind could tolerate slowness , even when indie and are replaced . " als die and are replaced . " " Well , we ca n't tolerate slownes said . She glanced at her watch . " Nyquist is going to call me said . She glanced at her watch . " Nyquist is going to call us you 're soon . Yout of time . " can bet he 'll tell us been a week , " Zark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a with him , tell Zark said glum it 's only ly . " Talking witer of time before I get him , tell him it 's only a matter of time before I get better results . " Delores promised to give Nyquist that message . She left Zark 's home and walked down the street to her home . Jan was in town , doing some kya-in-thestreet interviews . Doing something useful , she thought . Delores 's leave of absence kept her away from Nyquist , and while that may have kept her life-insurance premiums down , it left her feeling useless . Nyquist called at the local equivalent of five o'clock . " Zark 's time is up , " he said when Delores answered the phone . " He already knows , " Delores said . " He wants more time . " " Scientists , " Nyquist muttered . " Tell him he can keep trying , but we have to start our operations now . Dr. Feng says that the mnog will start their next reproductive cycle in a few more weeks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kilometers by the end of the cycle . That 's an area roughly the size of Africa-and the cycle after that will fill the entire planet . " I know , " Delores said . " What are we going to do to the mnog now ? " " We 're going to start with a suite of plagues , " Nyquist said . " Most of the viruses we release will kill the mnog outright . As for the survivors , the ones with natural immunity , we 've developed other viruses that will transform their DNA . That wo n't harm the victims , unfortunately , but their offspring will be too defective to live . " " It sounds effective , " Delores said , and shivered . She told herself that the mnog had brought this on themselves by invading Kya-but genocide still made her uneasy . " Talking that way , your ambassador does n't sound too optimistic , " Zark said that night . He paced the tiled floor of his home 's common room while Delores and Jan sat side-by-side on a pile of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I suppose he has a point-but I can still get results . " He spoke English for their benefit . " I 'm sure you can , " Delores said . Zark sounded almost casually arrogant , which she supposed was a good thing in an alpha . He probably did n't need to have his ego built up any more , but she saw no harm in doing a little extra work . " It 's going to impress Earth when a kya makes contact with the mnog . " Zark sniffed in agreement , then looked sty . " Talking as you do , I appreciate the boost , Del , " he said . " Alpha behavior being new to me , I may as well admit I 'm slinging it . " " You mean winging it , " Jan said . " Maybe a little of both , " Delores said . She looked up as Aur come out of the kitchen with a mug of what smelled like boiled lawn-clippings . On her way to give it to Zark , Aur casually touched things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , a window sill , Zark 's elbow Putting her scent on everything , Delores noted , marking her property . Zark might have become an alpha , but it was clear that Aur thought of him as her alpha . Zark seemed to accept that as a matter of course . Delores shivered slightly as the night breeze blew through the open window . With their delicate sense of smell , the kya needed lots of fresh air . their thick fur let them endure that air when it got cold , but Delores found herself leaning against Jan for warmth . Zark was talking about his plans to communicate with the nog when Delores heard a knock at the door . Aur answered it and Saito stepped into the house . " What are you doing here ? " Delores asked in surprise . " We need to talk , " the young man said . He glanced around . clearly uncomfortable at being in the presence of four people he had almost murdered . " The ambassador-everything he told you about the war was a lie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What do you mean ? " The UN has decided not to fight the invaders . " Saito began pacing back and forth . " I pulled some decoded messages from the computer system . The UN wants to avoid a war . And all those viruses we developed , he told me we would n't release them . " Delores started to say something , but Jan shushed her while Zark spoke . " I get the scent . Not knowing how powerful the nog are , your UN fears provoking them . Doing that , they 're protecting the human herd from possible destruction . Selfish , but sensible . " " You do n't get it , do you ? " Saito , . id in exasperation . He reached into his jacket and pulled out some folded-up printouts which he handed to Zark . " Tomorrow we 're going to announce that we 've already infected the mnog . Later , we 'll announce that the diseases did n't work . Who can prove that we did n't release the bugs ? " " What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UN does n't want to fight , " Saito said . " They think they can do better dealing with the invaders than with the kva . " " Why is that ? " Jan asked , while Zark looked at the printouts . " Business . " Saito almost spat the word . " The kya are primitive . We ca n't sell them much modern equipment because they ca n't use it , much less afford it . And what do they have that we do n't already have ? Perfumes , sports , trinkets ? All we get from the kya are novelty items . " " But the mnog are different , J " Jan said . 4 They already have interstellar travel , death rays-who knows what else ? " I'hey could make a great market . Or they could be so advanced that anything we learn from them could revolutionize our economy . Either way- "  --  Nyquist lied to me , " Delores said . Despite the cold breeze through the open window she felt her face grow hot with anger . " Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slime , " Jan said . Delores saw her eye Saito in obvious suspicion , and Delores knew she suspected the young man of more treachery . " Why did Nyquist really want us killed ? " Jan demanded . " I do n't know , " Saito said . " He told me the same things he told Delores , but it does n't hold up . " " You 've got to have some idea , " Jan said . " No , he does n't , " Delores said grudgingly . She would never like Saito , but she could see that he wanted to make amends for his actions . " If Nyquist had sent him , he would have prepped the kid with a good story . Con men always cover all the angles . I think we 'll have to wring the truth out of Nyquist . " " Hearing all this , I think I can guess the truth , " Zark said . " Killing Jan , the IIN could keep her from reporting the facts . Killing me , your scientists would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory . Being witnesses , Del and Aur were in the way . That Nyquist is a clever little sneeze . " " Very clever , " Aur said . " Giving you that equipment , he lets you discover how to communicate with the mnog . With you doing all the hard work , he can later steal it for Earth 's use . " " Nyquist did n't expect Zark to find anything , " Delores said . " I think he did this to appear cooperative , so we would n't make trouble . " " And so we would n't suspect more treachery , " Zark said . He gave the printouts a thoughtful sniff , then handed them to Delores . " This mess being what it is , it could put a strain on our relations with Earth . How do we prevent that ? " " Do we want to ? " Aur asked . She stood by the door , which she had left open . Delores saw her fur ruffle lightly in the cold breeze . The pilot knew that Nyquist had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that news calmly Delores realized it had made a deep impression in her . " Doing this , is it a good idea to have anything to do with Earth ? " " I do n't know , " Delores admitted . " But I think the real question is how do we keep your people from getting wiped out ? " " We can start by getting some real news to Earth , " Jan said . " That might force the UN to keep its word . If I put together a report , can we get it to Earth without the UN censoring it ? " " I think so , " Saito told her . " Doing that , what happens next ? " Aur asked . " Not wishing to exterminate the mnog , we ca n't let the UN " save " us that way . " " Saying that , you 're quite right , scented one , " Zark said . " Mass murder being evil , we ca n't allow it . " " But what if it 's the only way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these mnog came from somewhere else . Wiping out this one colony wo n't hurt the rest of species on their home planet . " " Doing that , we would still eliminate all the mnog here , " Aur said . " The mnog forming a hive-mind , would n't that be like murdering a unique individual ? " While the others argued over what to do . Delores sat quietly and read Saito 's papers . The papers backed up his story , and gave more details . Early in the war the mnog had shot down a UN starship . Telemetry from the ship suggested that the attack was a misunderstanding . The ship 's drive had radiated a tremendous amount of energy. , but the aliens had not fired on it until its maneuvers had placed it on a collision course with Kya ; it seemed the aliens had mistaken it for a dangerous natural object . A mistake , Delores thought . As she read on she discovered that the UN found the attack made a convenient cover story . Declaring that a state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kya , and it let them censor the news from Kya . It would prove impossible to hide the extinction of another sentient species , but proper handling of the news would minimize the political impact on Earth , and allow terrestrial corporations to start doing business with the aliens . Delores dropped the papers on the floor . She had worked for the tIN for seven years ; she had volunteered for this assignment , even though Kya was a hardship post . It still seemed a worthwhile thing to do with her life . Nothing like idealism to make an idiot of you , she thought , and where did that leave you ? Following orders that would turn your stomach when you lost faith in them . Get a grip on yourself , she thought . The UN 's leaders were doing something evil . That did n't mean she had done anything wrong . But what in hell was she supposed to do now ? A gust of breeze pushed the papers across the floor . She reached for them , and shivered in the cold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't function when it got too cold . Too bad it was n't always this cold on Kya , but you could n't change the whole planet . But what if you could change the mnog ? Delores looked around as though remembering the other people in the room . " Saito , " she said . " Did the UN really send us plans for a genetic-engineering virus ? " He looked startled . " Uh , yes . We do n't plan to fight , but if the aliens are a problem-or the kya- " " We 're ready for them , " Delores said . " Can we use it to make just one change in the mnog ? Something that wo n't kill them , but will leave them with unhealthy offspring ? " Saito looked thoughtful , then nodded after a moment . " The virus comes from basic medical stock , and Feng cracked the aliens " genetic code . It should be a simple plug-in problem . What have you got in mind ? " " Modify the mnog , " Delores said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cold , so they can only live near the equator . " Zark took a long , slow breath , as if sampling the idea 's scent . " Elegant , " he said at last . " Doing that , we wo n't have to worry about miscommunicating with the mnog , or having them ignore our wishes . " " If it works , " Saito said . " And what if they retaliate when they catch us tampering with them ? They could wipe us out . " " They 'll do that if we do n't try anything , " Delores said . " This way gives us a chance . " " Good point , " Zark said . " As they do not yet know that aliens exist , this change could seem like a natural event to them . The question is , can we sneak this past Nyquist ? " " I think so , " Delores said . " Let 's get to the embassy and- " She had started to stand ; Jan grabbed her and pulled her back down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nyquist can get another shot at us ? " " I do n't think he 'll try anything there , " Delores said . " There are too many witnesses . He tried to kill us where nobody could see it . Besides . . She glanced at the kya . " We have to try . " Jan hesitated , then nodded . As they entered the embassy and headed for the factory room Delores realized she had felt safer in the invasion zone . She had Jan , Zark and Saito with her , but there was no security in numbers . Nyquist probably would n't take any action against them at the embassy-but she saw a large gap between " probably " and " definitely . " That gap became evident when Delores saw Nyquist and two armed security officers standing outside the door to the embassy 's factory room . " Cripes , " Jan muttered from behind her , " It 's Ming the Merciless and his henchmen . " Nyquist missed her comment . " Delores , " he said , giving her a cordial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and-Zark , is n't it ? You 're in the wrong part of the embassy . This area is off-limits to kya . " " Except under extraordinary circumstances , " Delores said . " Paragraph three-eighty-nine-cee of the operating code , " Nyquist said . " However , I decide what constitutes extraordinary circumstances . " I 'm surprised to see you with them , Mr. Saito . Did Delores make another threat of legal action against you ? " " No , " Saito said . That made Nyquist frown . " Then why are you involved in this ? Legally , no one can touch you for following my orders . " al know , " he said , and Delores heard the nervous tremor in his voice . al can get away with murder . . . only I do n't want to . " Delores watched Nyquist 's frown deepen . " May God save me from selfstyled idealists . We 'll discuss this matter in my office . " " By all means , " Zark said in an affable tone . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you comfortable there . Do lead the way . " Nyquist glared at him , then walked past him and the others . Escorted by the security officers , Delores and the other three followed Nyquist into his office . As the door closed behind them Delores noted that the chairs for guests had vanished . Not exactly a surprise , she thought ; intirnidation was one of the darker tools in any diplomat-s kit . Nyquist seated himself behind his desk and looked at his four guests . " I can guess what 's happening , " he said . " A few hours ago Mr. Saito went to see Zark . A short while later , Dr. Feng received a phone call from Zark , asking for data on the invaders " genetic code . You planned to create a virus which could destroy the invaders , did n't you ? " " Not exactly , Delores said . The idea is to do a little genetic engineering , and make them more sensitive to cold . " Nyquist 's frown told her that he was caught off-guard by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The point is to slow down their metabolism a bit , " Delores said . " If they can only live where it 's hot , such as the tropics , they wo n't be able to overrun the entire planet . It 's a simple fix , if it works . " " If , " " Nyquist repeated . " Even then it will leave the invaders holding a large part of Kya . " " Quite acceptable , " Zark said . He looked around the office , then perched himself on the corner of Nyquist 's desk , an act which made Nyquist frown again . " Being human , it bothers you when someone encroaches on your territory , correct ? We do n't feel that way . Land is just something you walk over . " " Which is n't relevant , " Nyquist said . " Not to you , ' " Jan said . " What 's relevant is that the UN wants to let the mnog take all of Kya , because it might be good for business . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " What proof do you have ? " " I 've seen the computer files , " Saito said . " And you ordered me to sabotage that plane with the spybots , Mr. Nyquist . " " Did I ? Do you have anything in writing ? No ? " Nyquist smiled . " Well , let me give you something in writing . " He opened a desk drawer and pulled out three large envelopes . He handed one to each of the humans in his office and settled back in his chair . " Delores , Mr. Saito , you 're both fired . As for our charming member of the fourth estate , you 're hereby banned from this embass . " Delores barely heard him as she tore open her envelope and skimmed through its contents . She felt her temper surge at what she read . " You have no grounds to fire me ! " " The charges are quite explicit , " Nyquist said . " And the UN will decide their validity , when you get back to Earth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events , who will believe you ? Two disgruntled employees , fired for dereliction of duty ? A small-time sports reporter , looking to break into the big time ? " Nyquist shook his head . " There are other humans on Kya , " Delores said . She barely noticed when Zark reached out and took her letter from her . " You ca n't expect all of them to stay quiet . " " We can isolate them from you , " Nyquist said , " and make certain they only hear the correct version of events . The UN is working to protect humanity 's interests . You will not be allowed to interfere with that mission . " " Get a whiff of this , " Zark muttered as he read the letter . " Writing this , you 're kicking Del and Jan out of your herd ? " " And Mr. Saito . " Nyquist said . " They had their chances . " " I get the scent , " Zark said . " Needing jobs , they 're welcome to work for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " " Until the mnog take over this planet , " Nyquist said . " You may all leave now . " Delores hung back as Jan , Zark and Saito left the office . Jan looked unhappy about leaving Delores with Nyquist , but she acquiesced at a nod from her . Trusting me to be right , Delores thought . For a moment Nyquist pretended to not notice that Delores had remained . Then he looked up at her . " If you want a second chance- " " I do n't . " Delores sat on the same corner of the desk that Zask had occupied . " I 'm curious . Why is it so important to keep the kya from making trouble ? " He looked blank . " What makes you say that ? " " There was that briefing the other week , " Delores said . " You acted like an alpha , telling the kya what we would do and acting like they had to accept it . You belittled Zark when he argued with you . That 's why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were afraid the other kya might listen to him , and start doubting what you said . " " What if they do ? " Nyquist said . " They wo n't be around much longer . " " But they 'll survive a few more months , wo n't they ? " Delores looked at his face , which had become an unreadable mask . Whatever he was thinking , his effort to hide his reactions told her she was on the trail of something important . " What sort of trouble can they make ? Defeat the mnog by themselves ? Communicate with them ? No , it has to be something else . " Nyquist shrugged . " They might inconvenience us . Riots outside the embassy and our other facilities-well , our defenses are good , but why take chances ? " Delores realized he was lying . " Riot ? The kya ? All they do when they 're upset is demonstrate-impress you with their determination . No , you want them to die off without a fuss . . . " Her voice trailed off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course . You want it to look like they did n't have the will to survive " They do n't , " Nyquist said vehemently . " All they can do is follow their leaders , and all their leaders can do is congratulate themselves on how many followers they have . " " And that 's a reason to let them die off ? " She felt disgusted . " What is it you want ? For the other humans here to go home and say that they watched the kya give up without a fight , so they did n't deserve to live ? That extinction served them right ? " " No . " Sweat beaded on his forehead , and Delores saw his hand shake as he wiped it away . " Yes . Listen . It 's best for humanity . The UN could become a true world government . . . but it needs support . We can get that from businesses , if we show them that a powerful UN is to their benefit . And it is . The invaders-I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are businessmen who want new markets , new inventions . Something that will benefit all of humanity . The kya ca n't supply that , but the invaders might . " Delores stared at him for a moment . " Is it worth it ? " " Yes . " His voice was hoarse . " It must be . " " You know better . " She glanced at the wall clock . By now Jan and the others were away from the embassy and its security force . " And the kya wo n't go quietly . Did you know that the alphas are chosen by their females ? " " No , I-what does that have to do with anything ? " " Everything , " Delores said . " The alphas are n't really leaders . They respond to what the herd wants . Did you notice Lark 's surprise when you fired me ? Kicked me out of your herd , he called it . You even put it in writing , and he has the letter . You 've just discredited yourself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working for Zark . I 'll be saying I think he 's a better leader than you- " " Which means nothing . " " It means everything to the kya . They wo n't listen to you any more , but they 're starting to take Zark seriously . He wo n't go quietly . " She backed away from the desk as if to leave . " And you ca n't kill every human on Kya , or silence them . When they get back to Earth some of them will spread the truth . Think the UN administration can survive that ? " " Wait , " he said , as the door opened for her . " This plan of yours . . adapting the invaders so they can only live near the equator-can it work ? " " It might , " Delores said . She heard the uncertainty in his voice-and the hope . She realized he had enough decency in him to want a way out of this mess . " You have n't killed anyone yet . And you have n't gone down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before you do . " After a long moment he took a pen and scribbled something on a notepad . " Try it . Then get the hell out of my sight . You do n't care that this will end my career , do you ? " Good guess , she thought . Delores considered saying something , but Nyquist did n't seem worth a comeback . She left the office . Jan was waiting for her outside the embassy gate . " You okay ? " she asked as she hugged Delores . Delores nodded and gestured at the embassy . " Tell Zark that Nyquist says we can try it . " " That 's all that counts . " " Except for having blown my career , and turned the UN against us . " " You have good taste in enemies . " She slid an arm around Delores " waist . " Besides , you have a new career , with Zark . This time next year he 'll be doing business with the nog , which means Earth will have to do business with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change Kya ? " Delores tried to imagine it : an influx of new technology from two alien species . For better or worse , Kya was about to change . No , not for the worse , she thought . She would do what she could to make the changes for the best . And how often did anyone get the chance to help make a new world ? " I imagine it 's going to be good , " she said , and saw Jan answer with a smile .
