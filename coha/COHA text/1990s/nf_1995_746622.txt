A description of the theoretical basis for throe different biofeedback programs designed to assess harmony in one 's feelings in relation to culture embraced . The first program uses guided imagery based on cognitive structure  --  The Neural Functioning Cognitive Feelings Test ( NCFT ) , the second uses pictures to assess same feeling areas , The Neural Functioning Emotional Feelings Test ( NEFT ) , and the third is The Voluntary Control Test ( RELAX ) designed to assess voluntary control . Four different biofeedback instruments are used in each of the three programs . <p> " There are two worlds : the world that we can measure with line and rule , and the world we feel with our hearts ad imagination . " Lehigh Hunt <p> <p> In Client-centered counseling as described by Carl Rogers ( 1951 , and 1979 ) we learned about the importance of one 's feelings in relation to the health care of individuals . Here feelings become the central feature , as opposed to the problem , because Rogers believed that our feelings create the problem . For the health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to listen to the patient in relation to his/her feelings . <p> " We come to a consideration of what many would regard as one of the central features of any type of therapy  --  the release of feelings . Certainly one of the significant goals of any counseling experience is to bring into the open those thoughts and attitudes , those feelings and emotionally charged impulses , which center around the problem and conflicts of the individual . " Where Feelings are Born <p> The nucleus for one 's feelings may be traced almost directly to four major neural functioning systems ; each incited and directed by select clusters of recently discovered endogenous opioids and the endocrine system as described by David S. Goldstein ( 1990 ) . Working at the National Institute of Health , Goldstein insists that the endogenous system is intimately connected physiologically to the adrenal cortical and adrenal modullary systems . The acetyl-cholins were the first peptides discovered by Loewi in the 1920s , for which he received the Noble prize in 1936 , and they cluster in the digestive system . There they stimulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , decrease the heart rate , increase salivation an sweating , and often induce vasodilation . Then , in 1975 , A Scotsman in Bethesda , Maryland discovered the b-endorphins ; which cluster largely in the pituitary gland area ; and are related to pleasure and feelings of well being . Enkephalins , related to pain , tend to cluster in the area of the adrenal glands , and in the dorsal column of the spinal cord . Finally , the fourth of the major peptide systems , dopamine , distributes in the blood stream . It is probably the most critical of all four in relation to one 's level of wellness . It determines one 's sensitivity to praise and blame , the basis for operant conditioning and conditioning management . When one imbibes in alcohol , it tends to decrease the level of dopamine , and thus to minimize one 's sensitivity not only to praise and blame , but maybe even disturbing the hemostatic functioning of the anatomy . Internal Communication Lines <p> A characteristic element of all peptides and neurotransmitters is that they derive by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1990 ) . Of greater importance is the fact that each one possesses an antenna permitting direct communication with each other and select areas of the brain . This , of course , means that such communication often by-passes the typical and traditional expected control of the " reticular formation " ( brain computer system ) within the limbic system of the brain . The other major elements in the limbic system with the reticular formation are : 91 ) the pituitary glad , and ( 2 ) the hypothalamus . For many years it was suspected that the close relationship between the pituitary gland and the other glands , of which it is the governor , would alert the body to stress-like brain messages , even before such messages were being released by the reticular formation . Now , of course , with the advent of peptides and neurotransmitters , it is doubly clear that the anatomical systems communicate with one another independent of the brain , and carrying the messages back and forth are these newly being discovered peptides . For some years , now , they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they promise to influence health care in the 21 st century as DNA has influenced biology in the 20th century . Feelings and Health <p> It is becoming increasingly clear that the traditional " mind " resides in the body through the peptides , as well as in the brain , and that feelings and emotions play an important and critical role in both disease and health . It was Candance Pert ( Hall , 1989 ) who first demonstrated that a relatively small family of molecules could be identified as the biochemical basis for emotions . It was she who discovered the antenna on peptides with their communication qualities . She maintained that these peptides with their receptors serve as the biochemistry of our emotions ; which in large part regulate human behavior . She insisted that the immune system recognizes and senses those things one ca n't hear , taste , touch , smell , or feel ; things not recognized by any other sense . Candance was one of the first to insist that our anatomical systems routinely communicate with one another , and that those powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and serving as go-between molecules . Four Major Neural Functioning Systems <p> The four major peptide systems in the human body are much like a symphony orchestra , with each of the different systems serving like a major instrument in the orchestra . In summary , those instruments , then , are described as follows : **26;555;TOOLONG largely in the stomach-responsible largely for " gut mobility . " b-endorphins-clustering largely in the pituitary gland area-and responsible for feelings of well-being . Enkephlins-clustering largely in the adrenal gland area-and responsible for pain . Dopamine-in blood-responsible for sensitivity to praise and blame , and maybe even the hemostatic balance in one 's system . Nature of Harmony <p> First , and foremost , harmony among the basic neural functions means that they work as a team would be expected to work in support of the well-being of the individual . In relation to the connotation of harmony , they have been likened to a symphony orchestra , and where each of the peptide systems is like major instruments in such an orchestra . Here , of course , voluntary control of those systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ includes maintaining a harmonious relationship with each other in relation to cultural expectations of the individuals that are presently being embraced . Here there is a continuous and dynamic regulation of each of the four systems , and always in relation to each other ; just as major instruments in a symphony orchestra . It is , to be sure , a skill that is learned , and that can be improved by effective health care ; both from the psychologist and the physician . Role of One 's Expectations <p> More and more we learn that one 's personal expectations dwarf all other considerations in relation to the effectiveness of health care . While expectations are critically important for effective health care , they , of course , are not sufficient alone . The roots of one 's expectations derive largely from the particular cultural aberrations in which a person maintains or embraces membership for the moment of time . While it is true that people are always born into a particular culture , some into mixed cultures , nativity alone does not determine the culture membership , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nevertheless , the culture embraced typically determines the vital and critical expectations of the individual involved . For example , the Buddhist who holds seances with the grandmother , who died a generation ago , is a voice equally as important in health care as the persuasion of the physician in terms of expectations of such patient . From Physiological to Psychological <p> Technological advances in bioelectronics , imaging procedures , and laboratory computing have made it possible to record signals from the brain and physiological systems with increasing accuracy ( Cacioppo and Tassinary , 1990 ) . Four of the five major feelings ( fifth being brain waves ) presently being assessed by use of biofeedback instruments are presently involved in current health care practices : GSR - the established relation between electron dermal response , or skin resistance to electricity , is clearly associated with pleasant and unpleasant olfactory stimuli , affectivity sensitivity , and even to the discerning of truth ( lie detection ) . EMG - the electromyograph provides a continuous record of the intrinsic electrical activity associated with muscle contraction , and kinesthesis . TEM - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presence of the sympathetic syndrome , activation of the " fight or flight pattern " , where blood is being deprived from finger and rushed to vital organs as if to devour the enemy ( emergency state ) . PUL - the pulse rate of the individual is clearly an effective index of one 's perceived stress load ; the degree to which one is willing to accept full responsibility for perceived load , and which is easily translated to one of caring and commitment . From Neural Functions to Feelings <p> The connecting link between the four referenced peptide systems and the four feelings being assessed by use of biofeedback instruments ( GSR , EMG , TEM and PUL ) is firm and solid . This , or course , does not mean , or even imply , that there is a one-to-one relationship between the particular feeling being assessed by one of the biofeedback instruments ( GSR , EMG , TEM &; PUL ) and one of the peptide systems . Rather it is like the symphony orchestra in a concert hall , where harmony among the total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the four major peptide systems , it is the harmony , or lack of such harmony , that determine the specific feelings that emerge , and the particular feelings being assessed by the four biofeedback instruments are no exception to this rule . Under the principles of topologiccel psychology , that which exists can have effects , and it is now clear that the four primary peptide systems exist ; so we must expect them to impact on the individual in some real manner . Self Efficacy and Self-esteem <p> Whether we recognize it or not , the self efficacy ( personal satisfaction ) of the individual is an important internal driving force . People tend to embrace that which provides personal satisfaction , and builds own self-esteem . It , unlike self efficacy , always refers to peer membership as a major determinant , which , to be sure , is equally important . The self efficacy operating from within ; while self-esteem is determined externally ( peers ) . Bandura ( 1993 ) has shown that persons with high self efficacy tend to set high goals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People with low self efficacy , tend to set low goals , and tend to withdraw when adversity obtains . The vital basis of self efficacy , of course , derives from our feelings , and which are created by the neural functioning systems ( peptides ) . Voluntary Control and Harmony in Neural Functioning <p> Self-regulation and voluntary control is inherent in the typical meditation by Eastern philosphers . Patricia Norris ( 1989 ) describes how Basmajan in the early 1960s was able to exhibit single motor unit firing , inhibit the surrounding motor units , and then to cause a single motor unit to fire a rhythm , a single beat , a roll of three , or whatever was wished , simply by willing it to occur . About the same time Joe Kamiya demonstrated that college students could turn Alpha brain waves on and off at will . Norris , of course , maintains that all voluntary activity is initiated through use of mental imagery , and it need not remain conscious and deliberate ( Epstein , 1994 ) . She insists that leaning a skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and feedback . It is the feedback that makes the learning experience scientific , without which the imagery remains as if " tea leave reading " . The biofeedback instruments provide that feedback knowledge , and add immeasurable to our scientific acumen . The practice of a skill consists of repeating a performance with careful attention focused on the goal in relation to the feedback ( provided by use of biofeedback , making it the more scientific ) , that matches one 's imagery . This , to be sure , involves cognitive activity ( consciousness ) , the exploration of one 's inner space , and where guided imagery makes it the world of tomorrow , today in the use of such health care . Transpersonal Psychology and Autogenics <p> Civilization has been variously estimated to be maybe 800 human life times old , and clearly 650 of those life times were spent in a cave . Modern civilization , though , is but one life time old , a single life time , and many of us today remember it well ; as we have grown through most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every one a neighbor . Since that beginning , about every ten years there has been a major break-through in modem technology . By 1910 the Wright Brothers gave us the airplane ; in 1920 the gift of motion picture ; 1940 the Germans gave us the missile ; 1950 we inherited television ; 1960 the computer ; 1970 the laser ; 1990 peptides and neurotransmitters ; and in 1990 Fourth Force Psychology , Transpersonal Psychology , and where autogenics came of age ; and , of course , tracing its history back to early Eastern philosophic meditation techniques . In the early 1920s it was Schultz and later Luthe of Germany who added a scientific image to autogenics . The stages described by Schultz and Luthe are as follows : Passive volition , Relaxation of striated muscles , Voluntary control of emotion and visceral , Autonomic function control , Building a bridge between brain hemispheres , Guided imagery and " body FORTRAN " ( Luthe ) , finally Self analysis as described by Karen Homey <p> Autogenics is , without a doubt , the most effective means for the management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well documented , for its success are numerous and legion : Increasing or decreasing thyroxine for persons with thyroid gland problems ( Luthe ) , Cure of brain tumor in youth ( Norris ) . Cure of air sickness for astronauts ( Cowings ) . Decrease of body age and increase of zest for living ( Imrick &; Imrick ) . Effective management of pain ( Shealy ) . <p> Transpersonal psychology , from which autogenics evolved , is described by Bynum ( 1992 and Taylor , 1992 ) as both an evolving clinical and scientific tradition within psychology ; also as an ancient psychospiritual lineage . It includes states of consciousness such as meditation , religious ecstasy , trance and " initiative " conscious experiences ; and , to be sure , it includes the study of psychophysiological techniques , and introspective disciplines associated with these states of consciousness . Finally , it also includes metaphysics , neuroscience ( with biofeedback ) and , of course , cognitive psychology : <p> " I am one of those spirit-souls who dwell in the light God . I have made my form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city of ) Tetu . I am a Spirit-body among his spirit bodies . " ( Egyptian Book of dead ) <p> Psychoneuroimmunology &; Cyberphysiology <p> It is , of course , clear , that a change in the anatomical system is always accompanied by a corresponding change in the psychological system . Similarly , a change in the psychological system is accompanied by a change in the anatomical system . Karen Olness has devoted the past 15 years exploring cyberphysiology in children ( Pilkington , 1983 ) . Her goal has been the understanding of the extent to which one is able to modulate autonomic responses . She has done creditable experimentation in exploring mechanisms children use to bring about changes in the brain function , immune measures , and skin resistance ; to find out what occurs between the though change and the affect ( feelings ) . Her findings in one important study at Minnesota Children 's Medical Center were based largely on change in saliva samples , interspersed with varying kinds of induced behavior . Her results indicate that imagery training was a crucial factor in enabling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a review of such research Jaylene Kent , et al . ( 1984 ) maintained that the field of psychoneuroimmunology ( PNI ) has demonstrated rather conclusively that learning , imagery , beliefs , personality and coping style may lead to a particular interaction between the central nervous system and the immune system . Clearly , the advent of disease is a state of war between germs , viruses and other attacking forces on the one hand , and the defense forces of the organism , the immune system on the other ( Adler , et . al. , 1991 ) . Health Care in the 21st Century <p> Biofeedback , both for the development of voluntary control , and the assessment of harmony in neural functioning remains a high priority for health care . This , of course , means that the health care provider is a licensed practioner . Too often , in the use of biofeedback , this is not the case , and which suggests that the level of sophistication of the biofeedback user is lacking . Nevertheless , around the world biofeedback is increasingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first health care revolution occurred in the late 19th century where the primary problem had to do with infectious diseases ( Cassel , 1994 ) . The leading killers were then influenza , pneumonia , diptheria , and gastrointestinal infection . Then from 1900 to 1970 major chronic illnesses increased 250 percent . Coronary heart disease , often referred to as the " silent killer " , accounted for more than half of the deaths . <p> Holistic health care became wide spread in the Western culture when Frantz Alexander , father of psychoanalysis , defined the new kind of health problem as being " holistic " in nature . He insisted that a healthy body is necessary for a healthy mind , and that all illness is psychosomatic with physical and mental components interacting . It was during this latter period when Fourth Force Psychology was introduced by Hilgard and others ( 1977 ) . The first other three forces being characterized largely by the notion that thrust for change in human behavior came largely from forces external to the individuals involved : <p> First Force Psychology - operant conditioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Force Psychology - depth psychology and child is the father of the person ( Freud and Jung ) . <p> Third Force Psychology - humanistic psychology where feelings take center stage ( Rogers , 1979 ; and Maslow , 1954 ) . <p> Fourth Force Psychology - transpersonal psychology where the thrust for change emanates from the individuals ; as opposed to external forces , and where cognitive constructivism ; as opposed to memory , play a dominant role . Here a major driving force is self efficacy , and where being mature means playing role of parent to child ; even for the five year old in relation to the three year old ; etc . <p> Fifth Force Psychology - it would be most naive not to include " psi " phenomena , para-psychology , with mental telepathy , clairvoyance , and metal physics with cosmic consciousness . Assessing Feelings With Biofeedback <p> Three different programs have been developed , and are presently in experimental form , for assessing the four primary deeper feelings . <p> This article seeks to discuss the origin and evolution of theory underlying those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in separate literature , and are not covered in this article . Each one of them is presently in experimental form and available for use as described : The neural Functioning Cognitive Feelings Test ( NCFT ) , The Neural Functioning Emotional Feelings Test ( NEFT ) , &; The Voluntary Control Test ( RELAX ) . Comparable Indices for Assessment <p> A rather unique feature used in the construction of these three assessment instruments ( NCFT , NEFT , and RELAX ) is that , through use of the computer the signals from each of the four biofeedback instruments are converted to a standard-like scale scores are equal to each other ; an EMG of 50 is equal to the same PUL of 50 ; a TEM of 50 is equal to a GSR of 50 , etc . In addition , the TEM score is reversed ; so that all higher scores depict increased neural functioning . Then , for each new assessment element , the GSR is re-set to 50 ; so as to minimize the impact of any previous readings . Brain Laterality <p> The NCFT and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominance . Based on Sperry 's findings that the dominant brain is primarily cognitively oriented ; while the nondominant brain is feelings oriented . The BCFT uses cognitive activity related to dominant brain ( Is your home warm and friendly ? - with individual answering in secret while recordings are made ) ; the BEFT uses pictures related to dominant brain ( picture of mother holding a crying child-rated for appeal while recordings are made ) ; and RELAX with instructions on how to relax for dominant brain , and music for relaxation for nondominant brain assessments . <p>
