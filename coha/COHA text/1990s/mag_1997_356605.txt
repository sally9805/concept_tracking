Great performances have been easier to find than great plays on Broadway this season . Michael Gambon , making his U.S. stage debut last fall , stormed impressively through Skylight , a lesser work by David Hare . Antony Sher 's luminous portrayal of English painter Stanley Spencer makes Pam Gems ' Stanley look better than it probably is . Christopher Plummer is currently having a high old time impersonating the boozing thespian John Barrymore , though the vehicle , Barrymore , is little more than a facile stand-up monologue . <P> Janet McTeer , the latest Brit sensation to make her Broadway debut , has the advantage of bringing along a play really worthy of her talents . Ibsen 's A Doll 's House might seem an obvious war-horse for an actress looking to make her mark . But McTeer turns Nora 's famous feminist self-affirmation into more than just a political tract . This is a revelatory performance , the kind that takes a familiar play , gives it a hard shake and makes us experience it anew . <P> McTeer ( who has done Shakespeare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sackville-West in PBS 's Portrait of a Marriage ) is a tall , imposing-looking blond , which makes her wifely submissiveness early in the play all the more grotesque . Flapping her hands and giggling nervously , she is hardly able to contain her energy  --  and , indeed , seems ready to fly apart as an old transgression ( she once forged a signature to acquire a loan ) threatens to unravel her pat little marriage . Yet a freezing calm overtakes her in the final confrontation with her husband Torvald , in which McTeer ( helped by Frank McGuinness 's vigorous translation ) stunningly conveys a woman whose eyes  --  and mind  --  are suddenly opening . " No man sacrifices his integrity for the person he loves , " protests Torvald , after Nora says she expected him to take the blame if her past sin were revealed . " Hundreds of thousands of women have ! " she replies in a fierce half whisper that has the clarity of a thunderclap . <P> Director Anthony Page does n't allow McTeer 's virtuoso turn to overshadow a fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the London production ) as Torvald . He 's uptight and patronizing but far from a foolish figure . When he stands alone after Nora leaves , we feel the full impact of the play 's emotionally complex climax : both triumph ( a woman freed ) and tragedy ( a family broken ) , a cause for cheers and for weeping . Most theatergoers will simply let out a slow exhale , after an evening that takes the breath away . <P>  --  By Richard Zoglin
