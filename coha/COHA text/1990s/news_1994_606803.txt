<p> Let 's see what 's on . CNN is on Channel 204 , ESPN is on Channel 206 , C-SPAN is on Channel 242 , Arts &; Entertainment is on Channel 256 , Nick at Nite is on Channel 968 , HBO is on Channels 980 through 984 , and MTV is on Channel 989 . <p> That 's right , I said Channel 989 . No , I have n't gone stark-raving mad . I 've gone stark-raving digital . Thanks to an early Christmas present from a dear friend , I have the new Digital Satellite System ( DSS ) from RCA . It brings 150 channels of TV into my living room with stunningly clear pictures , super-duper stereo sound , and more movies and basketball games than you can shake a remote at . <p> Utopia . Nirvana . Heaven on Earth . I may never leave the house again . I may never leave the living room again . This is what I always thought cable would be like , but is n't . <p> DSS TV has come about through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) TV and digital signal compression . To get TV channels from outer space , you formerly needed a very large dish in your back yard and an investment of $ 2,000 or more . There are some 3.9 million of these so-called C-band dishes in use today after about a decade on the market . <p> But DSS makes satellite TV much more manageable and twice as affordable . It uses a small dish , only 18 inches in diameter ( " pizza-sized , " says the publicity ) , which can attach to your roof or the side of the house , plus a receiver , smaller than a VCR , that goes on top of the TV set . The system sells for under $ 1,000 , including professional installation . <p> Once it 's installed , however , you have to pay a monthly fee to a program service in order for something to appear on all those channels , which are numbered from 100 to 999 but which include lots of unused spaces . You can subscribe to DirecTV , which gives you all the basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for $ 29.95 a month , or United States Satellite Broadcasting ( USSB ) , which brings in HBO and Showtime and virtually all other premium services for $ 34.95 a month . <p> Or you can be a shameless glutton ( like me ) and subscribe to both . Since about three dozen channels are devoted to pay-per-view movies , usually at $ 2.99 per showing , and several more channels offer sports packages like NBA basketball for added fees , it 's easy to imagine the monthly bill rising to $ 100 and beyond . But the system includes a feature that will impose a monthly spending cap of your choice if you 're worried you might pleasure yourself into bankruptcy . <p> Clearly , this is the greatest new toy since the VCR , with pictures so sharp and rich that it 's as if a veil were lifted from in front of the screen . Cable can not compare . We keep hearing about the " 500-channel universe " just around the corner , but it looks like an enormous corner . The 150-channel universe is here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other features of the system : an on-screen programming guide accessible with the touch of the menu button on the remote . It shows what 's on six stations at a time over a two-hour period . The guide can even be instantly customized to list only movies or only sports events . In addition to all the video , there are 28 channels of stereo music . Channel 500 is currently devoted to holiday tunes . <p> There are limitations . To get DSS , you need a clear shot at the southwestern sky , where the two satellites are sailing along at 22,300 miles up ( " co-located , " in industry jargon ) . To get the maximum flexibility from DSS , and order those pay-per-view movies just by pushing buttons on the remote , there must be a phone jack available near the set . <p> And since DSS is a " line of sight " system , it 's subject to something called " rain fade , " the fading depending on the amount of rain . If a really big storm comes between your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those channels at once . <p> Even so , DSS is " far more reliable than any cable system in the country , " insists Stanley E. Hubbard , 33-year-old president of USSB , who with his father , also named Stanley , has been in the forefront of this technology . " So far , since signing on in June , we 've had outages less than two-tenths of 1 percent of the time . " <p> As cable subscribers know , cable can disappear at the drop of a leaf from a tree . If a bird sings too loudly , you might have a cable outage . A car drives by ? Look out . <p> The combined investment in DSS is more than $ 1 billion but business appears to be booming . A spokesman for Thomson Consumer Electronics , owner of RCA and maker of the dishes and the receivers , claims the company will make good on its vow to ship between 500,000 and 600,000 units by the end of the year ( downsized from an original projection of 700,000 ) , but stubbornly refuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retail sales so far , not counting last-minute holiday purchases , at just over 300,000 . Even at that rate , the company would have met its goal of surpassing first-year sales of the home VCR  --  a mere 209,000 units in 1977 , according to Thomson . <p> " There 's no question this is the beginning of an era , the digital era , " Hubbard says . " What the cable operators and phone companies have been promising for years , we can deliver now . " <p> Imagine how delighted the cable companies are . If there 's anything the cable industry hates , it 's competition . DSS offers consumers deliverance from cable 's poor service , often shabby pictures and the need to wade through an endless array of tacky shopping channels to get to something watchable . " Satellite has become the first true national competitor to cable , " says Bob Sherman , editor and publisher of the Washington-based Satellite Business News . <p> Of course , the bill of fare DSS offers its customers is made up largely of networks developed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Sherman says the fuss over DSS has made people generally more aware of satellite TV as an alternative to cable , and that dish sales of all kinds are up . " These things are really hot now , and it 's scaring the expletive out of the cable industry , " Sherman says . No matter what kind of satellite system one buys ( and DSS has a competitor in Primestar , a similar but poorly promoted system ) , picture quality is always better than cable , Sherman says : " Pulling up the rear is cable , leaps and bounds behind everybody else . " <p> The cable industry is becoming painfully cognizant of the stranger in town and will soon be launching a counteroffensive , Sherman says , predicting " a guerrilla marketing war " in the coming year . Sony is expected to introduce a receiver and dish for use with the DSS system in the spring or summer , making the system even more widely available . <p> Dave Hauspurg , co-owner of two ProVideo stores in this area , says he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . In fact , faster . " If I 'd had 30 more to sell , I 'd be in fat city , " Hauspurg says . " The response has been phenomenal . It 's the single most universally pleasing product we 've ever had . <p> " And so far there have been no complaints  --  not a peep  --  which is almost unheard of for something brand-new . " A couple of dishes have blown down in the wind , but they were put right back up . <p> " One reason it 's doing so well is consumer backlash against cable , " Hauspurg says . " There are so many unhappy cable customers out there . When I got my DSS system and called Montgomery County cable to cancel , I was thrilled . Of course , they kept me on hold for 30 minutes . That 's one reason I 'm glad to be rid of them . " <p> DSS ca n't quite replace cable , or broadcast TV , however , because it does not deliver local stations . DSS customers subscribing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't subscribe to cable and ca n't get acceptable pictures from their local stations over the air can , for an additional fee , add ABC , CBS , NBC , PBS and Fox to their DSS menu . <p> And although sales of DSS units are brisk now , it 's still at the stage where it attracts the technophiles and video gourmets who simply must have every new gadget they can afford , or even ca n't . Next year 's sales will tell more about how big a future DSS has when mainstream consumers decide whether to opt for it . Advertising so far has been minimal and , for the most part , dumb , promising viewers " bloodier blood " when they hook up to the system . Oh good . <p> Whether DSS is the technology of tomorrow is hard to say , but at my house , it 's definitely the technology of today . It 's something wonderful and fabulous and amazing that 's not on the drawing board or on the horizon or in the foreseeable future . It 's seeable right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm watching television . Watching , watching , watching . Watching like I 've never watched before . <p> CAPTION : The satellite dish for DSS broadcasts is just 18 inches wide .
