<p> As if Mike Piazza does n't have enough on his mind - with his left hand throbbing and the Los Angeles Dodgers wobbling toward postseason play - he will spend the final week of the season trying to catch five-time champion Tony Gwynn in the National League batting race . <p> Batting styles do n't get much more disparate than this . Piazza hacks away as if every at-bat is his last . Gwynn is a master at spoiling good pitches and dumping balls over the shortstop 's head . <p> Los Angeles Times columnist Mike Downey said Gwynn and Piazza might have less in common than any two hitters in baseball . " It 's like watching Casper the Friendly Ghost against Paul Bunyan , " Downey wrote . <p> Both players , understandably , are averse to spending much time talking about batting titles as the season winds to a close . The Dodgers are in danger of losing the N.L. West and missing the playoffs entirely . They play seven of their final 10 games against San Diego , so the Padres will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of personal goals came up several times when the Padres visited Dodger Stadium over the weekend . Before the opening game of the series , reporters asked Gwynn if he expected to converse with Piazza when he stepped in the batter 's box in the first inning . <p> " Usually in the first at-bat , I 'll say , ' Michael , how are you doing ? You 're looking tired , " ' Gwynn said . " And he 'll say to me , ' Man , this catching is killing me . ' Tonight I do n't know what 's going to happen . " <p> As it turns out , Piazza took the initiative . When Gwynn entered the box in the first inning , Piazza said it 's time Gwynn step aside and allow Piazza to win the batting title . <p> " What does he need another batting title for ? " Piazza said . " So he can make a bannister out of them ? " <p> Gwynn broke out laughing , then stepped out to compose himself . There 's nothing like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race . <p> AROUND THE BASES <p> How anxious is Phillies manager Jim Fregosi for the season to end ? After the Marlins were successful on six straight steal attempts Monday night , Fregosi observed , " It 's a major concern . Our pitchers do not hold runners very close , so it 's definitely a concern . But it 's only a concern for 11 more games . " Barring a late rush , the Phillies will be the only major-league team to fall short of 100 home runs . Jim Eisenreich hit the Phillies ' 90th homer Thursday . Dante Bichette , Larry Walker and Vinny Castilla have combined for 101 Pittsburgh 's Paul Wagner has won three of his last five decisions . One of Wagner 's biggest problems was his slow arm action on his changeup , so pitching coach Ray Miller addressed the problem by teaching Wagner a palm ball . " He 's been kind of a mystery man , " manager Jim Leyland said . " He has n't adjusted to the art of pitching , but we 're hoping it will click @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overpowering arm . " ... The Pirates are limping to the finish , but Leyland does n't view the impending sale of the club as a distraction . " There are probably 10 guys ( in our clubhouse ) who do n't even know it 's up for sale - and do n't care , " Leyland said The Mets started an all-rookie outfield of Damon Buford in left , Carl Everett in center and Alex Ochoa in right Tuesday against Atlanta If the Padres plan to make the jump from .500 club to contender , they better find a first baseman with some pop . San Diego management lacks the cash to make a run at free agent Fred McGriff , so the Padres ' best bet might be shifting outfielders Melvin Nieves and Marc Newfield to first and letting them compete for the job in spring training Scott Livingstone , formerly of the Tigers , has been a pleasant surprise at first for San Diego . He 's batting .340 . But Livingstone hit only four home runs in his first 177 at-bats San Diego pitcher Joey Hamilton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ken Caminiti some batting tips before Caminiti homered from both sides of the plate three times in four games . " I just told him to be patient and look for a pitch he can drive , " Hamilton said The Astros are sour on shortstop Orlando Miller , who continues to beg out of the lineup with a sore knee . Teammate Craig Biggio , meanwhile , wo n't miss a game despite a variety of bumps , bruises and other ailments . When manager Terry Collins asked if he could use a day off , Biggio replied , " Who ca n't ? " ... The Marlins ' biggest off-season priority is finding a center fielder who can hit . General manager Dave Dombrowski might pursue free agent Devon White , who earned $ 4 million this season in Toronto Here 's another reason why Barry Larkin is an MVP candidate : After the Reds looked lethargic in a loss to Montreal , Larkin called a team meeting and aired out his teammates so thoroughly the clubhouse walls shook Mets outfielder Ryan Thompson told the New York Post he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Philadelphia is right in my backyard and I 've always loved it there , " said Thompson , a Maryland native . The Phillies plan to shift Lenny Dykstra to left field - over his objections - and are looking for a center fielder . <p> NAMES IN THE GAME <p> The Colorado Rockies , among other teams , were hot after Montreal starter Jeff Fassero in July . But after a 7-1 start , Fassero has dropped to 13-13 . <p> Now Montreal pitching coach Joe Kerrigan says Fassero might benefit from talking to a sports psychologist about his body language on the mound . The Expos have grown tired of watching Fassero mope and kick the dirt when things do n't go his way . <p> Kerrigan says Greg Maddux told him he benefited from seeing a sports psychologist six years ago . But Fassero , whose relationship with Kerrigan is strained , does n't necessarily buy that . <p> " When we get to Atlanta , I 'm going to talk to Maddux , " Fassero said last week . " He might just be blowing smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like - he believes everything everybody tells him . " <p> It 's become readily apparent that Fassero , who is making $ 1.5 million this year , will not be back with the Expos in 1996 . <p> " I 'm sick of all the crap around here , " Fassero told the Montreal Gazette . " I 'm sick of sitting in meetings going over batters and have catchers call the exact opposite pitches . I think we have to just go out and pitch . " <p> Don Baylor , Davey Johnson and perhaps Bobby Cox are the leading candidates for N.L. manager of the year . But Houston general manager Bob Watson is putting in a plug for his guy , Terry Collins . <p> " Terry has handled the brushfires as well as the major forest fires and kept this club right there , " Watson said . " He 's had asbestos shoes in the clubhouse , and he 's found a way to keep this team in the hunt . I do n't think there are many managers out there who would have fared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Watson 's argument has some merit . Consider : <p> Jeff Bagwell , the reigning N.L. MVP , was batting .205 June 5 and missed the entire month of August with a broken hand . <p> Doug Drabek and Greg Swindell , Houston 's marquee starters , are a combined 19-17 with ERAs exceeding 4.50 . <p> Darryl Kile , Houston 's No. 3 starter , pitched his way back to the minors . <p> John Hudek , the Astros ' closer , went down for the year in June with a circulation problem near his right shoulder . <p> Derek Bell missed the stretch run with a muscle tear in his thigh . <p> The Astros encountered a ticklish situation when former No. 1 draft pick Phil Nevin threw a tantrum in Collins ' office in July . Watson later traded Nevin to Detroit . <p> Houston 's clubhouse was in turmoil after the Astros recalled former replacement player Craig McMurtry from the minors in August . But the Astros recovered from an 11-game losing streak . <p> To top it off , Collins has to deal with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Through all the external garbage , he has kept the Astros in contention . For a while , it appeared Collins ' job might be in jeopardy . But the Astros gave him a two-year extension in June that runs through the 1997 season .
