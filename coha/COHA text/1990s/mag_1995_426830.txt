Section : THE TRANSPLANTED GARDENER <p> How one man transformed the nation 's taste <p> On July 28 , 1852 , two Hudson River paddle steamers en route from Albany to New York City decided to race . The Henry Clay , commanded by its builder and part owner ( the captain was laid up with severe indigestion ) , eventually pulled ahead of its rival , the Armenia , maintaining its lead by stoking the boilers to white heat . The passengers were terrified , and rightly so , but pleas for caution fell on deaf ears . At last , no more than 20 miles short of New York , the Henry Clay 's badly overtaxed boilers ignited the wooden deck . Within moments the whole ship was blazing . In the resulting disaster  --  the ship sank in short order  --  more than 70 people died . Among them was Andrew Jackson Downing , architect and tastemaker . <p> I 've always been curious about Downing , the more so now that I 'm far away from America . Lay it to nostalgia . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and parapeted dwellings that are so much a part of mid-19th-century American culture , and that Downing , more than anyone , inflicted upon the countryside . You can still find them moldering away on the outskirts of old New England resort communities like Stockbridge , awkwardly jammed into too-small lots in declining Upper New York State villages , or carefully restored , bright with fresh paint , as precious examples of " Hudson River Bracketed . " <p> The fact is , however , that A. J. Downing ( he preferred initials in apparent emulation of his hero , the English garden writer J. C. Loudon ) was more than an architect . He was also a central figure in the history of American gardening , so much so that 20 years after his death Harper 's Magazine remarked that " no American has built for himself a more permanent monument than Downing the landscape gardener . " Houses engaged him , but at heart he was a gardener , a man fascinated by plants and the way they could  --  and should  --  be used to beautify and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced to dwell in log huts and follow the hunter 's life , we must not be surprised at lynch law and the use of the bowie knife , " he wrote . " But , when smiling lawns and tasteful cottages begin to embellish a country , we know that order and culture are established . " <p> Downing himself was never forced to dwell in a log hut . As Russell Lynes put it , he.was virtually born in a garden . His father , a wheelwright , had left one family in Springfield , Massachusetts ( without bothering to divorce , it seems ) and moved to Newburgh on the Hudson , where he started another family and a nursery . Both thrived . Andrew was born in 1815 , by which time the Botanical Gardens and Nurseries were well on their way to being prosperous , and when he was still in his teens he joined his brother Charles in running the establishment . <p> For customers with taste and money to spend , Newburgh was exceptionally well placed . A few years later , describing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 20-mile stretch of the Hudson about 100 miles north of New York City , there was an almost continuous succession of " the finest American country seats . " The river itself was part of the attraction , providing splendid views as well as convenient access to the city , and there was a tradition of wealth dating from the Dutch patroons and their English successors , who controlled vast tracts of land in the valley . <p> So far as gardening was concerned , wealth counted greatly . Growing things for pleasure , as opposed to growing things to eat , was very much a rich man 's game in the United States during the first half-century of the nation 's existence . Much has been written about Thomas Jefferson 's horticultural interests , for example . In the same way , a number of upper-crust Anglophiles familiar with the work of " Capability " Brown and his successors were busily lavishing dollars on the creation of landscaped estates . As a result , elaborate establishments like Woodlands and Lemon Hill near Philadelphia , Waltham House and Belmont Place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and New York 's Westchester County matched almost anything in the old country . The best examples of all were in the Hudson Valley . " There is no part of the Union , " Downing was to write , " where the taste in Landscape Gardening is so far advanced . " <p> As is clear from the very term used to describe it , this was not gardening for Everyman . But the serious planning and execution of private gardens on a wider scale was beginning , driven , like so much else , by the spread of bourgeois prosperity . Suddenly , many more people had the means and the time to devote to such fascinating matters as taste and style in clothes , furniture , houses , and , inevitably , the settings in which they lived . <p> Downing was destined to be a leading agent in the change , and as his biographer , George Tatum , points out , his main inspiration was J. C. Loudon . A few years earlier , Loudon had launched his extraordinary career in England as a horticultural writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of magazines and books devoted to the proposition that you did n't need ancestral acres to be a landscape designer or gardener . Improving the surroundings of your cottage or suburban villa was not only a plausible aim , it was a practical way to demonstrate the excellence of your taste . All that was needed was the technical knowledge , and this Loudon was in a position to supply , copiously . His vast Encyclopedia of Gardening told how to do absolutely everything , from laying out a serpentine flower bed in the height of fashion , to constructing a cesspool . <p> In America , Downing had begun publishing articles when he was 17 in such papers as The New York Farmer and Horticultural Register These were mostly botanical accounts and occasionally slightly poetical effusions on landscapes or questions of taste . Downing was plainly eager to make a greater impression . Working in a nursery and writing squibs was all very well , but he had a greater role in mind for himself . He read widely . The writings of such 18th-century English landscape commentators as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraged his romantic streak , while the more practical approach of Humphry Repton suggested what might be attempted given the natural glories of the American landscape . Loudon , however , was the key . The Englishman 's conviction that " rural embellishment " was within anyone 's grasp meshed exactly with Downing 's interests and ambitions . He would write a book on " country places " that would do for America what Loudon had done for Britain . <p> He was only 26 when , in 1841 , he published A Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening , Adapted to North America : With a View to the Improvement of Country Residences . Though much less encyclopedic than Loudon 's work , it was an immediate hit , and justly so . In prose that was modestly graceful and unobtrusively romantic , it offered middle-class men and women an intoxicating vision of what might be done to make their homes , their surroundings , and  --  at least by implication  --  their lives more beautiful and tasteful . Better still , it told how to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Downing found himself famous . As his friend and memorialist Clarence Cook later wrote , Never , perhaps , in literature had so young a man met with so sudden and extended a reputation . " Part of it must have been due to his personal charm and appearances  --  that of " a tall , slight Spanish gentleman , " romantic and dashing , with penetrating dark eyes and dark hair worn almost shoulder-length . The impression was not lessened by his having a well-born young wife ( in 1838 he had married a grandniece of John Quincy Adams ) and a fine country estate not far from Newburgh , designed in the Gothic mode and landscaped by himself . <p> Perhaps it was his own experience as an amateur architect , perhaps it was just that new fashions were in the air  --  the classical Greek Revival style had largely run its course  --  but Downing recognized the appeal of new house plans and quickly produced another book called Cottage Residences consisting of almost nothing but new house plans . It reveled in what may now strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One said , " We would sooner live in a tub . " ) The designs included Tuscan villas , chalets that would startle a Swiss , workman 's cottages with board-and-batten siding and bracketed eaves , Gothic oddities in wood and stone . None was lacking in character , however , and the landscaping shown in the many vignette engravings illustrated the sophistication and appeal of Downing 's horticultural grounding . <p> For despite his architectural interests , Downing continued to deal with plants and planting . In 1845 , once again working with his brother , Charles , he completed The Fruits and Fruit Trees of America , which was to go into many editions and achieve great popularity , especially after Charles later expanded and revised it . In 1846 , Downing took over the editorship of a new magazine called The Horticulturist , more accurately subtitled Journal of Rural Art and Rural Taste , and within two years its circulation exceeded that of any magazine of its class in the country . Both of these projects added to his fame ; the queen of Holland sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trees , and Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia gave him a gold medal . Such distractions may account for the fact that at the end of 1846 his finances fell into disarray , and the nursery had to be sold off . In 1850 he produced a second book of house designs , The Architecture of Country Houses . <p> Throughout the 1840s , Downing worked as a landscape designer , apparently specializing in the grounds of insane asylums and fashionable cemeteries . He also took private commissions . An advertisement from the time sets out his charges  --  they ranged from $10 for " a design for a flower garden " to $100 for landscaping a substantial villa " in accordance with correct principles of taste , " the whole to include " working drawings , details of ornamental structures , &c.; complete , and the principal outlines staked out on the ground , and lists of shrubs and trees furnished . " Unaltered examples of his design work no longer exist , although sketches in his books and descriptions in old magazines give a good idea of what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an actual survival is Matthew Vassar 's Springside estate near Poughkeepsie , which has undergone many vicissitudes in the 150 years since Downing laid it out ( including very nearly being replaced by an apartment complex ; it is now a listed National Landmark ) . Contemporary photographs and drawings give an impression of its many groves , fountains , ponds , and urns , all bound up in a cat 's cradle of paths and winding drives . There was even a false ruin . The general effect is one of overstuffing , like a Victorian sofa whose red plush is on the point of explosion . <p> In 1851 , Downing got his biggest commission of all  --  to design the Public Grounds of Washington , D.C. This was the entire area covering the present Mall , and north to the White House , much of it swampy waste . He quickly produced drawings , and the work started , slowed only briefly by complaints from politicians and bureaucrats who objected , among other things , to his practice of paying short regular visits to the site instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter in Downing 's favor , and the landscaping went ahead . <p> It was less than a year later , while traveling to Washington on one of his periodic trips , that Downing and his family had the misfortune to choose the Henry Clay for the first leg of the journey . Survivors of the disaster told of his heroism : he was last seen tossing chairs off the upper deck to help passengers in the water to float . His own wife survived by clinging to a couple of chairs until she was rescued . <p> Downing 's legacy was clearly mixed . In the hands of less talented designers , his fanciful houses came to represent the worst of Victorian excess . His advocacy of sweeping lawns no doubt contributed to the American taste for endless grass  --  and endless mowing . The Washington park on which he had been laboring came to nothing without his presence ; a patchwork of smaller schemes in later years created what now exists . He could , however , claim some indirect credit for a far greater park , New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young architect Calvert Vaux from England to work with him . It was Vaux  --  applying what he had learned about landscaping from Downing  --  who with Frederick Law Olmsted saw that magnificent enterprise through to completion . <p> Downing has been called " the greatest single figure in the history of American horticulture . " He has also been called " the father of the public park " and a number of other high-sounding titles . Yet it may be that his most important and lasting achievement is something harder to put a name to . By inspiring thousands of ordinary Americans living in ordinary houses on ordinary pieces of land to undertake " embellishment , " he helped them become , almost in spite of themselves , gardeners . So in a sense we are all his heirs . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : A. J. Downing <p> ILLUSTRATION Further Reading <p> The Architecture of Country Houses .
