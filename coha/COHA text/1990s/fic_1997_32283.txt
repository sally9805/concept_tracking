It was Rayford Steele 's turn for a break . He pulled the headphones down onto his neck and dug into his flight bag for his wife 's Bible , marveling at how quickly his life had changed . How many hours had he wasted during idle moments like this , poring over newspapers and magazines that had nothing to say ? After all that had happened , only one book could hold his interest . The Boeing 747 was on auto from Baltimore to a four o'clock Friday afternoon landing at Chicago O'Hare , but Rayford 's new first officer , Nick , sat staring ahead anyway , as if piloting the plane . Does n't want to talk to me anymore , Rayford thought . Knew what was coming and shut me down before I opened my mouth . " Is it going to offend you if I sit reading this for a while ? " Rayford asked . The younger man turned and pulled the left phone away from his own ear . " Say again ? " Rayford repeated himself , pointing to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seen for more than two weeks and probably would not see for another seven years . " As long as you do n't expect me to listen . " " I got that loud and clear , Nick . You understand I do n't care what you think of me , do n't you ? " " Sir ? " Rayford leaned close and spoke louder . " What you think of me would have been hugely important a few weeks ago , " he said . " But --  " " Yeah , I know , OK ? I got it , Steele , all right ? You and lots of other people think the whole thing was Jesus . Not buying . Delude yourself , butleave me out of it . " Rayford raised his brows and shrugged . " You would n't respect me if I had n't tried . " " Do n't be too sure . " But when Rayford turned back to his reading , it was the Chicago Tribune sticking out of his bag that grabbed his attention . The Tribune , like every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : During a private meeting at the United Nations , just before a Nicolae Carpathia press conference , a horrifying murder/suicide had occurred . New U.N . Secretary-General Nicolae Carpathia had just installed the ten new members of the expanded Security Council , seeming to err by inaugurating two men to the same position of U.N . ambassador from the Great States of Britain . According to the witnesses , billionaire Jonathan Stonagal , Carpathia 's friend and financial backer , suddenly overpowered a guard , stole his handgun , and shot himself in the head , the bullet passing through and killing one of the new ambassadors from Britain . The United Nations had been closed for the day , and Carpathia was despondent over the tragic loss of his two dear friends and trusted advisers . Bizarre as it might seem , Rayford Steele was one of only four people on the planet who knew the truth about Nicolae Carpathia -- that he was a liar , a hypnotic brainwasher , the Antichrist himself . Others might suspect Carpathia of being other than he seemed , but only Rayford , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buck Williams knew for sure . Buck had been one of the seventeen in that United Nations meeting room . And he had witnessed something entirely different -- not a murder/suicide , but a double murder . Carpathia himself , according to Buck , had methodically borrowed the guard 's gun , forced his old friend Jonathan Stonagal to kneel , then killed Stonagal and the British ambassador with one shot . Carpathia had choreographed the murders , and then , while the witnesses sat in horror , Carpathia quietly told them what they had seen -- the same story the newspapers now carried . Every witness in that room but one corroborated it . Most chilling , they believed it . Even Steve Plank , Buck 's former boss , now Carpathia 's press agent . Even Hattie Durham , Rayford 's onetime flight attendant , who had become Carpathia 's personal assistant . Everyone except Buck Williams . Rayford had been dubious when Buck told his version in Bruce Barnes 's office two nights ago . " You 're the only person in the room who saw it your way ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buck had said , " we all saw it the same way . But then Carpathia calmly described what he wanted us to think we had seen , and everybody but me immediately accepted it as truth . I want to know how he explains that he had the dead man 's successor already there and sworn in when the murder took place . But now there 's no evidence I was even there . It 's as if Carpathia washed me from their memories . People I know now swear I was n't there , and they are n't joking . " Chloe and Bruce Barnes had looked at each other and then back at Buck . Buck had finally become a believer , just before entering the meeting at the U.N . " I 'm absolutely convinced that if I had gone into that room without God , " Buck said , " I would have been reprogrammed too . " " But now if you just tell the world the truth --  " " Sir , I 've been reassigned to Chicago because my boss believes I missed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his invitation . I have n't talked to Hattie yet , but you know she wo n't remember I was there . " " The biggest question , " Bruce Barnes said , " is what Carpathia thinks is in your head . Does he think he 's erased the truth from your mind ? If he knows you know , you 're in grave danger . " Now , as Rayford read the bizarre story in the paper , he noticed Nick switching from autopilot to manual . " Initial descent , " Nick said . " You want to bring her in ? " " Of course , " Rayford said . Nick could have landed the plane , but Rayford felt responsible . He was the captain . He would answer for these people . And even though the plane could land itself , he had not lost the thrill of handling it . Few things reminded him of life as it had been just weeks before , but landing a 747 was one of them .  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- Buck Williams had spent the day buying a car -- something he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found a beautiful condo , at a place that advertised already-installed phones , midway between the Global Weekly Chicago bureau office and New Hope Village Church in Mount Prospect . He tried to convince himself it was the church that would keep drawing him west of the city , not Rayford Steele 's daughter , Chloe . She was ten years his junior , and whatever attraction he might feel for her , he was certain she saw him as some sort of a wizened mentor . Buck had put off going to the office . He was n't expected there until the following Monday anyway , and he did n't relish facing Verna Zee . When it had been his assignment to find a replacement for veteran Lucinda Washington , the Chicago bureau chief who had disappeared , he had told the militant Verna she had jumped the gun by moving into her former boss 's office . Now Buck had been demoted and Verna elevated . Suddenly , she was his boss . But he did n't want to spend all weekend dreading the meeting , and neither did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again right away , so Buck drove to the office just before closing . Would Verna make him pay for his years of celebrity as an award-winning cover-story writer ? Or would she make it even worse by killing him with kindness ? Buck felt the stares and smiles of the underlings as he moved through the outer office . By now , of course , everyone knew what had happened . They felt sorry for him , were stunned by his lapse of judgment . How could Buck Williams miss a meeting that would certainly be one of the most momentous in news history , even if it had n't resulted in the double death ? But they were also aware of Buck 's credentials . Many , no doubt , would still consider it a privilege to work with him . No surprise , Verna had already moved back into the big office . Buck winked at Alice , Verna 's spike-haired young secretary , and peered in . It looked as if Verna had been there for years . She had already rearranged the furniture and hung her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and loving every minute of it . A pile of papers littered Verna 's desk , and her computer screen was lit , but she seemed to be idly gazing out the window . Buck poked his head in and cleared his throat . He noticed a flash of recognition and then a quick recomposing . " Cameron , " she said flatly , still seated . " I did n't expect you till Monday . " " Just checking in , " he said . " You can call me Buck . " " I 'll call you Cameron , if you do n't mind , and --  " " I do mind . Please call --  " " Then I 'll call you Cameron even if you do mind . Did you let anyone know you were coming ? " " I 'm sorry ? " " Do you have an appointment ? " " An appointment ? " " With me . I have a schedule , you know . " " And there 's no room for me on it ? " " You 're asking for an appointment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd like to know where I 'm going to land and what kind of assignments you have in mind for me , that kind of --  " " Those sound like things we can talk about when we meet , " Verna said . " Alice ! See if I have a slot in twenty minutes , please ! " " You do , " Alice called out . " And I would be happy to show Mr. Williams his cubicle while he 's waiting , if you --  " " I prefer to do that myself , Alice . Thank you . And could you shut my door ? " Alice looked apologetic as she rose and moved past Buck to shut the door . He thought she even rolled her eyes . " You can call me Buck , " he whispered . " Thanks , " she said shyly , pointing to a chair beside her desk . " I have to wait here , like seeing the principal ? " She nodded . " Someone called here for you earlier . Did n't leave her name . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No message ? " " Sorry . " " So , where is my cubicle ? " Alice glanced at the closed door , as if fearing Verna could see her . She stood and pointed over the tops of several partitions toward a windowless corner in the back . " That 's where the coffeepot was last time I was here , " Buck said . " It still is , " Alice said with a giggle . Her intercom buzzed . " Yes , ma'am ? " " Would you two mind whispering if you must talk while I 'm working ? " " Sorry ! " This time Alice did roll her eyes . " I 'm gon na go take a peek , " Buck whispered , rising . " Please do n't , " she said . " You 'll get me in trouble with you-know-who . " Buck shook his head and sat back down . He thought of where he had been , whom he had met , the dangers he had faced in his career . And now he was whispering with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wanna-be boss who had never been able to write her way out of a paper bag . Buck sighed . At least he was in Chicago with the only people he knew who really cared about him .  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- Despite his and Chloe 's new faith , Rayford Steele found himself subject to deep mood swings . As he strode through O'Hare , passed brusquely and silently by Nick , he suddenly felt sad . How he missed Irene and Raymie ! He knew beyond doubt they were in heaven , and that , if anything , they should be feeling sorry for him . But the world had changed so dramatically since the disappearances that hardly anyone he knew had recaptured any sense of equilibrium . He was grateful to have Bruce to teach him and Chloe and now Buck to stand with him in their mission , but sometimes the prospect of facing the future was overwhelming . That 's why it was such sweet relief to see Chloe 's smiling face waiting at the end of the corridor . In two decades of flying , he had gotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terminal . Most pilots were accustomed to simply disembarking and driving home alone . Chloe and Rayford understood each other better than ever . They were fast becoming friends and confidants , and while they did n't agree on everything , they were knit in their grief and loss , tied in their new faith , and teammates on what they called the Tribulation Force . Rayford embraced his daughter . " Anything wrong ? " " No , but Bruce has been trying to get you . He 's called an emergency meeting of the core group for early this evening . I do n't know what 's up , but he 'd like us to try to get hold of Buck . " " How 'd you get here ? " " Cab . I knew your car was here . " " Where would Buck be ? " " He was going to look for a car and an apartment today . He could be anywhere . " " Did you call the Weekly office ? " " I talked to Alice , the secretary there , early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we can try again from the car . I mean , you can . You should call him , do n't you think ? Rather than me ? " Rayford suppressed a smile .  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- Alice sat at her desk leaning forward , her head cocked , gazing at Buck and trying not to laugh aloud as he regaled her with whispered wisecracks . All the while he wondered how much of the stuff from his palatial Manhattan office would fit into the cubicle he was to share with the communal coffeepot . The phone rang , and Buck could hear both ends of the conversation from the speakerphone . From just down the hall came the voice of the receptionist . " Alice , is Buck Williams still back there ? " " Right here . " " Call for him . " It was Rayford Steele , calling from his car . " At seven-thirty tonight ? " Buck said . " Sure , I 'll be there . What 's up ? Hm ? Well , tell her I said hi , too , and I 'll see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging up as Verna came to the door and frowned at him . " A problem ? " he said . " You 'll have your own phone soon enough , " she said . " Come on in . " As soon as he was seated Verna sweetly informed him that he would no longer be the world-traveling , cover-story-writing , star headliner of Global Weekly . " We here in Chicago have an important but limited role in the magazine , " she said . " We interpret national and international news from a local and regional perspective and submit our stories to New York . " Buck sat stiffly . " So I 'm going to be assigned to the Chicago livestock markets ? " " You do n't amuse me , Cameron . You never have . You will be assigned to whatever we need covered each week . Your work will pass through a senior editor and through me , and I will decide whether it is of enough significance and quality to pass along to New York . " Buck sighed . " I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with my works in progress . I do n't suppose you know . " " Your contact with Stanton Bailey will now funnel through me as well . Is that understood ? " " Are you asking whether I understand , or whether I agree ? " " Neither , " she said . " I 'm asking whether you will comply . " " It 's unlikely , " Buck said , feeling his neck redden and his pulse surge . He did n't want to get into a shouting match with Verna . But neither was he going to sit for long under the thumb of someone who did n't belong in journalism , let alone in Lucinda Washington 's old chair and supervising him . " I will discuss this with Mr. Bailey , " she said . " As you might imagine , I have all sorts of recourse at my disposal for insubordinate employees . " " I can imagine . Why do n't you get him on the phone right now ? " " For what ? " " To find out what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my relocation . You know as well as I do that relegating me to regional stuff is a waste of my contacts and my experience . " " And your talent , I assume you 're implying . " " Infer what you want . But before you put me on the bowling beat , I have dozens of hours invested in my cover story on the theory of the disappearances -- ah , why am I talking to you about it ? " " Because I 'm your boss , and because it 's not likely a Chicago bureau staff writer will land a cover story . " " Not even a writer who has already done several ? I dare you to call Bailey . The last time he said anything about my piece , he said he was sure it would be a winner . " " Yeah ? The last time I talked to him , he told me about the last time he talked to you . " " It was a misunderstanding . " " It was a lie . You said you were someplace and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd have fired you . " " If you 'd had the power to fire me , I 'd have quit . " " You want to quit ? " " I 'll tell you what I want , Verna . I want --  " " I expect all my subordinates to call me Ms. Zee . " " You have no subordinates in this office , " Buck said . " And are n't you --  " " You 're dangerously close to the line , Cameron . " " Are n't you afraid Ms. Zee sounds too much like Missy ? " She stood . " Follow me . " She bristled past him , stomping out of her office and down the long hallway in her sensible shoes . Buck stopped at Alice 's desk . " Thanks for everything , Alice , " he said quickly . " I 've got a bunch of stuff that 's being shipped here that I might need to have you forward to my new apartment . " Alice was nodding but her smile froze when Verna hollered down the hall . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll get back to you , Alice . " Buck moved deliberately enough to drive Verna crazy , and he noticed people in their cubicles pretending not to notice but fighting smiles . Verna marched to the corner that served as the coffee room and pointed to a small desk with a phone and a file cabinet . Buck snorted . " You 'll have a computer in a week or so , " she said . " Have it delivered to my apartment . " " I 'm afraid that 's out of the question . " " No , Verna , what 's out of the question is you trying to vent all your frustration from who knows where in one breath . You know as well as I do that no one with an ounce of self-respect would put up with this . If I have to work out of the Chicago area , I 'm going to work at home with a computer and modem and fax machine . And if you expect to see me in this office again for any reason , you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Verna looked prepared to stand her ground right there , so Buck headed back to her office with her trailing him . He passed Alice , who looked stricken , and waited at Verna 's desk until she caught up . " Are you dialing , or am I ? " he demanded .  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- Rayford and Chloe ate on the way home and arrived to an urgent phone message from Rayford 's chief pilot . " Call me as soon as you get in . " With his cap under his arm and still wearing his uniform trench coat , Rayford punched the familiar numbers . " What 's up , Earl ? " " Thanks for getting back to me right away , Ray . You and I go back a long way . " " Long enough that you should get to the point , Earl . What 'd I do now ? " " This is not an official call , OK ? Not a reprimand or a warning or anything . This is just friend to friend . " " So , friend to friend , Earl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but let me tell you , buddy , you 've got to knock off the proselytizing . " " The --  ? " " Talking about God on the job , man . " " Earl , I back off when anyone says anything , and you know I do n't let it get in the way of the job . Anyway , what do you think the disappearances were all about ? " " We 've been through all that , Ray . I 'm just telling you , Nicky Edwards is gon na write you up , and I want to be able to say you and I have already talked about it and you 've agreed to back off . " " Write me up ? Did I break a rule , violate procedure , commit a crime ? " " I do n't know what he 's going to call it , but you 've been warned , all right ? " " I thought you said this was n't official yet . " " It 's not , Ray . Do you want it to be ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in here for a meeting and a memo for your file and all that , or can I just smooth everybody 's feathers , tell ' em it was a misunderstanding , you 're cool now , and it wo n't happen again ? " Rayford did n't respond at first . " C'm on , Ray , this is a no-brainer . I do n't like you having to think about this one . " " Well , I will have to think about it , Earl . I appreciate your tipping me off , but I 'm not ready to concede anything just yet . " " Do n't do this to me , Ray . " " I 'm not doing it to you , Earl . I 'm doing it to myself . " " Yeah , and I 'm the one who has to find a replacement pilot certified for the ' forty-seven and the ' fifty-seven . " " You mean it 's that serious ! I could lose my job over this ? " " You bet you could . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've got it bad , Ray . Listen , in case you come to your senses and we can make this go away , you need to recertify on the ' fifty-seven soon . They 're adding a half dozen more within a month or so , and they 're going to be running them out of here . You want to be on that list . More money , you know . " " Not that big a deal to me anymore , Earl . " " I know . " " But the idea of flying the 757 is attractive . I 'll get back to you . " " Do n't make me wait , Ray . "  - -   - -   - -   - -   - -   - -   - -   " I will get Mr. Bailey on the phone if I can , " Verna said . " But you realize it 's late in New York . " " He 's always there , you know that . Use his direct , after-hours number . " " I do n't have that . " " I 'll write it down for you . He 's probably interviewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , Cameron , and I will even let you have your say , but I am going to speak to him first , and I reserve the right to tell him how insubordinate and disrespectful you 've been . Please wait outside . " Alice was gathering up her stuff as if about ready to leave when Buck emerged with a mischievous look . Others were streaming from the office to the parking lot and the train . " Did you hear all that ? " Buck whispered . " I hear everything , " she mouthed . " And you know those new speakerphones , the ones that do n't make you wait till the other person is done talking ? " He nodded . " Well , they do n't make it obvious you 're listening in , either . You just shut off the transmit button , like this , and then if something happens to hit the speakerphone button , oops , then you can hear a conversation without being heard . Is that cool , or what ? " From the speakerphone on her desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Stanton . Who 's this ? " " Um , sir , sorry to bother you at this hour --  " " You got the number , you must have something important . Now who is this ? " " Verna Zee in Chicago . " " Yeah , Verna , what 's happening ? " " I 've got a situation here . Cameron Williams . " " Yeah , I was going to tell you to just stay out of his hair . He 's working on a couple of big pieces for me . You got a nice spot there he can work in , or should we just let him work out of his apartment ? " " We have a place for him here , sir , but he was rude and insubordinate to me today and --  " " Listen , Verna , I do n't want you to have to worry about Williams . He 's been put out to pasture for something I ca n't figure out , but let 's face it , he 's still our star here and he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been doing . He gets less money and a less prestigious title , and he does n't get to work in New York , but he 's going to get his assignments from here . You just do n't worry yourself about him , all right ? In fact , I think it would be better for you and for him if he did n't work out of that office . " " But , sir --  " " Something else , Verna ? " " Well , I wish you had let me know this in advance . I need you to back me on this . He was inappropriate with me , and --  " " What do you mean ? He came on to you , made a pass at you , what ? " Buck and Alice pressed their hands over their mouths to keep from bursting with laughter . " No , sir , but he made it clear he is not going to be subordinate to me . " " Well , I 'm sorry about that , Verna , but he 's not , OK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regional stuff , not that we do n't appreciate every inch of copy that comes out of your shop , understand . " " But , sir --  " " I 'm sorry , Verna , is there more ? Am I not being clear , or what 's the problem ? Just tell him to order his equipment , charge it to the Chicago account , and work directly for us here . Got that ? " " But should n't he apolog --  " " Verna , do you really need me to mediate some personality conflict from a thousand miles away ? If you ca n't handle that job there ... " " I can , sir , and I will . Thank you , sir . Sorry to trouble you . " The intercom buzzed . " Alice , send him in . " " Yes , ma'am , and then may I --  " " Yes , you may go . " Buck sensed Alice taking her time gathering her belongings , however , staying within earshot . He strode into the office as if he expected to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't need to talk with you . He made it clear that I 'm not expected to put up with your shenanigans . I 'm assigning you to work from your apartment . " Buck wanted to say that he was going to find it hard to pass up the digs she had prepared for him , but he was already feeling guilty about having eavesdropped on her conversation . This was something new . Guilt . " I 'll try to stay out of your way , " he said . " I 'd appreciate that . " When he reached the parking lot , Alice was waiting . " That was great , " she said . " You ought to be ashamed of yourself . " He smiled broadly . " You listened too . " " That I did . See ya . " " I 'm going to miss the six-thirty train , " she said . " But it was worth it . " " How about if I drop you off ? Show me where it is . " Alice waited while he unlocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brand-new , " he answered . And that was just how he felt .  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- Rayford and Chloe arrived at New Hope early . Bruce was there , finishing a sandwich he had ordered . He looked older than his early thirties . After greeting them , he pushed his wire rims up into his curly locks and tilted back in his squeaky chair . " You get hold of Buck ? " he asked . " Said he 'd be here , " Rayford said . " What 's the emergency ? " " You hear the news today ? " " Thought I did . Something significant ? " " I think so . Let 's wait for Buck . " " Then let me tell you in the meantime how I got in trouble today , " Rayford said . When he finished , Bruce was smiling . " Bet that 's never been in your personnel file before . " Rayford shook his head and changed the subject . " It seems so strange to have Buck as part of the inner core , especially when he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new to it , are n't we ? " Chloe said . " True enough . " Bruce looked up and smiled . Rayford and Chloe turned to see Buck in the doorway .
