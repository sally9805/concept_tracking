In 1670 Andrew Eliot left East Coker in Somerset , England , for Boston . Two hundred and eighteen years later , his direct descendant , Thomas Stearns Eliot  --  who would become the most celebrated English-language poet of the century  --  was born in St. Louis , Mo. , to a businessman and a poet , Henry and Charlotte Eliot . Although young Tom was brilliantly educated in English and European literature and in Eastern and Western philosophy and religion , he fled  --  in his mid 20s  --  the career in philosophy awaiting him at Harvard , and moved to England . There he married ( disastrously ) , met the entrepreneurial Ezra Pound and , while working at Lloyds Bank , brought out Prufrock and Other Observations . Five years later , after a nervous breakdown and a stay in a Swiss sanatorium in Lausanne , he published The Waste Land . Modern poetry had struck its note . <P> Not everyone was impressed . Dorothy Wellesley , writing to W.B. Yeats , said petulantly , " But Eliot , that man is n't modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the throats of those who are either too busy , or too creative to read as much as he does . " " The juice of the past " is n't a bad description of the lifeblood of The Waste Land ; but it was a past so disarranged  --  with the Buddha next to St. Augustine , and Ovid next to Wagner  --  that a reader felt thrust into a time machine of disorienting simultaneity . And the poem had an unsettling habit of saying , out of the blue , " Oed ' und leer das Meer , " or something even more peculiar . It ended , in fact , with a cascade of lines in different languages  --  English , Italian , Latin , French , Sanskrit . Still , readers felt the desperate spiritual quest behind the poem  --  and were seduced by the unerring musicality of its free-verse lines . <P> The Waste Land was a deeply unoptimistic , un-Christian and therefore un-American poem , prefaced by the suicidal words of the Cumaean Sibyl , " I want to die . " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its desolation at the breakup of the Judeo-Christian past , the poem turns for salvation to the Buddha and his three ethical commandments : Give , Sympathize , Control . But on the way to its ritually religious close ( " Shantih , shantih , shantih " ) , it films a succession of loveless or violent or failed sexual unions  --  among the educated ( " My nerves are bad tonight " ) and the uneducated ( " He , the young man carbuncular , arrives " ) , and in the poet 's own life ( " your heart would have responded/ Gaily " ) . It speaks of an absent God and of a dead father ; Eliot 's recently dead father had left capital outright to the other children , but permitted his wayward son only the interest on his portion .
