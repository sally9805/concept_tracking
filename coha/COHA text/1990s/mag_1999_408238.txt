TO HONE THE FINE ART OF BUMP SKIING , NOTHING BEATS MACHINE-MADE MOGULS , ONE OF THE EAST 'S LATEST SKI-AREA INNOVATIONS . BY MITCH KAPLAN // i skid to a halt and look downhill . Steep and gnarly does n't begin to describe what I see . Terrifying might come close . The trail-wide , precipitously pitched , and called Grandstand-has the mumps . It 's covered with bumps that are wild and randomly placed , as if they 'd been hurled from a great height by evil snow gods . They lump up big as Volkswagens-with an icy showroom sheen-and are separated by deep , ski-bending fissures . Seen in the gray light of this overcast day , their shapes lack detail . But their murderous character is obvious . I look sheepishly at my pal and next-door neighbor , Lucky Abernathy . It 's my fault we 're here . I 'm the bump nut , not him . But this is out of my league . Lucky , an advanced-intermediate skier at best , looks at me like his luck just ran out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body-all by itself-immediately swivels back uphill . I make an about-face , dragging my poles in a futile attempt at control . Each turn releases a cacophony of scrapes and crunches . I bounce like a rag doll over two or three of these nasty humps then throw myself into a turn . I do this for a full 10 minutes before I reach bottom ( or is it hit bottom ? ) . Lucky , meanwhile , has been sideslipping the whole deal . Finally safe , we ski off to the base lodge . We 're scheduled to meet a guy named Dave , who 's going to teach us about bump skiing . The timing is ripe . dave capron is a ski instructor and staff trainer here at Attitash Bear Peak in northern New Hampshire . Dave 's promised to work with us just as he works with his ski pros-using one of Attitash 's newest terrain innovations : machine-made moguls . Now , creating mogul fields with grooming machines is n't new . Indeed , machine-made bumps first gained notoriety during the 1992 Olympics at Albertville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had an eerie feeling that skiing robots had created the perfectly shaped course . And many Eastern resorts-Killington and Sunday River in particular  --  have long been machining their famous expert bump runs for mogul competitions . But building bumps on easier trails and using them to teach bump skiing is new . At Attitash they use a green-rated trail named Counselor 's Run . Moderately broad and tree-lined , Counselor 's descends lazily . An incredibly uniform mogul field , brimming with moderately sized , beautifully rounded bumps that are separated by smooth , welcoming troughs , undulates for its full length and breadth . Even ice-coated , these moguls beckon me seductively . " Pick a line , " they seem to whisper , " you ca n't go wrong . " Dave is explaining the basics of bump skiing to Lucky , but I ca n't control the itch . I dive in . So regular are these mounds that I hit the rhythm in the first two turns and keep it going for a dozen more . Neither the flat light nor the ice intimidates me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus on feel . On fun . For a few fleeting seconds , I 'm as good a bump skier as anyone . I yank myself from this ecstasy , stop , and look back to check on my friend . Lucky 's knees are too stiff , and he 's forgetting to use his poles , but he 's moving through the bumps with a new eagerness . When he and Dave reach me , his face is one huge grin . Dave turns his attention to me . He tells me I look good-but there are things to correct . Keeping the upper body facing downhill , for one , which is tied to my right pole plant . Instead of flicking the pole forward and touching it lightly , I 'm literally trying to plant it , and leaving it there to take root . I 'm holding on , and that means the pole is n't going forward with me , so neither are my right hand , shoulder , or finally , upper body . I can get away with that here in the easy pitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm flailing . Dave 's instructions are simple : Ski the bottom section as slowly as possible , concentrating on that right-hand pole . I do as instructed . And I can concentrate on it because of the manicured , easy terrain . before grooming became ubiquitous , most ski runs-left to the ravages of skiers and Mother Nature  --  bumped up by themselves . I learned bump skiing on Killington 's Needle 's Eye , a wide , moderately sloped highway that once boasted acres of naturally created , moderate-sized moguls . The advent of pervasive corduroy , however , meant that moguls would remain untouched only in gnarly places . A whole skiing generation now equates bumps with two traits : huge and steep . But , now , with places like Attitash building bumps on runs like Counselor 's , grooming has performed a 180 , and the opportunity to learn bump skiing without terror has reappeared . Building those bumps , however , requires a true groom-meister . At Attitash Bear Peak , head groomer Bruno Vallieries is that person . Bruno , a bear of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes and adamant voice reflect his dedication to his calling . " First , you need the right density snow , " he says , sounding like Picasso describing how exactingly he mixes his paints . " You want machinegroomed , frozen granular to use as a base because it 's heavy and will stay compacted . But , you want natural snow on top for the best finish . " He describes how he builds a massive snow mound down the trail 's middle , then plows the snow so it slopes out to the trail 's edges . Driving uphill now , by dipping and raising the machine 's front plow blade , Bruno raises about 100 eight-foot-high snow piles . Then he prays for the storm . And if it does n't snow ? " I just flatten the whole damned thing out and wait for the next storm , " he grumbles . If it does snow , Bruno returns with a special " tn-flex " tiller ( " It 's got three separate sections and it 's flexible . " ) and packs and sculpts the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Photograph Time to make the moguls : Bumps creator Bruno Vallieries plows his trade . // we follow Dave to a groomed run , where he puts us through some strange paces before skiing the moguls . We ski crouched as low as possible , as if we 're squatting . It 's awkward , but Dave 's making a point . This exaggerated stance on the groomed will make knee-bending in the bumps feel less cumbersome . It 's like a baseball player swinging a weighted bat to make the regular bat feel lighter . Back on Counselor 's , it clearly makes a difference . I start deliberately , pushing my tips ahead into the trough and allowing my knees to come up like pistons as I pass over each mound . Again , I stop halfway . But , this time I ai n't waitin ' ' . I turn and go for it , piecing together all the elements-quick pole plant , flexible knees , and good absorption . And , whoa ! Look at this ! I 'm zipping through the moguls with class . Hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks almost loosey-goosey-and he 's linking turns . How good is our run ? We insist on doing it again . Dave decides we 're ready to move on and presents one last challenge : natural bumps . It has started to snow as we follow him to an advanced-intermediate run called Trillium . After about 50 yards , it drops off to a serious pitch pocked with large , ungainly humps erratically carved by panicky skiers . Without the security of Counselor 's perfect shapes and lines , I can sense Lucky 's knees stiffening . " Remember those low-as-you-can-go turns , " Dave reminds us . On the first go , I lose my line just where the trail drops . I slash to a halt just before veering into the trees . On the second go , I pick the same line , letting myself relax into greater knee flex when the going gets steep and the bumps larger . It works . But just as things are getting better , visibility sinks to zero , and we 're forced to call it a day . Photograph Flattening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dump leaves 15 inches of new , Western-style puffy fluff snow . A genuine powder day . I 'm to meet Lucky at the Kachina Lift , a snail-paced triple that serves only Trillium and a handful of other runs . Lucky 's beaming over the freshly powdered groomers he 's been cruising while I 've been eating breakfast . But he requires a pit stop , so I go solo . I beeline for Trillium with newfound confidence . The moguls are dressed-for-the-prom beautiful in their new , untracked white coats . I smile . I pick my line from yesterday and take it full speed ahead . The powder lets me float . I dip , I extend , I deftly plant a pole , then another . I 'm turning . I 'm burning . I caress the top of an elephantine mogul and catapult into the steep part . It 's all moving as one . I 'm picking my line on the fly . I 'm adapting to the changes in front of me . Damn ! I 'm doing it ! All the way in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A ledge ! No time to slow down now . I 'm up , over-and airborne . Whoa baby ! I let out a yell , fly seemingly forever , land with a thud-and stay on my feet . Holy sh- ! I did the whole run and finished with air ! I 've got to tell Lucky about this . I 've got to tell Dave . Hell , I 've got to do that again .
