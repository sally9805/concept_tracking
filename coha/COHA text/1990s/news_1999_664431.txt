<p> A note to teams looking for a quick fix : Do your homework . <p> Exhibits A : Washington , Seattle , Minnesota and the New York Jets . <p> Exhibit B : Antonio Langham . <p> Exhibit C : Chad Bratzke . <p> Contrary to logical order , exhibit C first . <p> Langham is perhaps the biggest bust of the season , particularly because he signed for $ 16.5 million over five years with San Francisco , a team that 's supposed to know what it 's doing . <p> He began as a starting cornerback , but got beaten so much and got so many interference and holding calls that he was benched . Then he acknowledged he was far better in a zone with the Browns-Ravens than the man-to-man the Niners usually play . <p> Bratzke , a defensive end for the Giants , wo n't be this year 's Langham - he 's better than that . But he 's not as good as the 11 sacks that could make him a prime target for teams desperately looking for a pass rusher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worker . He came all the way back this season from a serious knee injury . But his sacks total is due in part to opponents double-teaming All-Pro Michael Strahan ( 15 sacks ) on the other side and to the fact the Giants ' inside rushers - Keith Hamilton , Robert Harris and Christian Peter - also are dangerous . <p> The Giants would like to keep Bratzke and he would like to stay . But they have defensive line depth in Cedric Jones , Peter and Bernard Holsey and they do n't have cap room to match someone who overspends to sign him . <p> As for exhibits A and B ... <p> The Vikings did better than anyone on the free agent market this year , a major reason they 're 15-1 . Who did they sign ? John Randle , Robert Smith and Todd Steussie , among others , were re-signed . <p> In other words , they kept their own players , maintaining cohesiveness . Then all they had to do was wait for Randy Moss to fall to them in the draft and here they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jets and Seahawks . <p> For the second straight year , the Seahawks went big into the free-agent market , signing Ricky Watters and Brian Habib after picking up Chad Brown and some others the year before . <p> The player they did n't re-sign , center Kevin Mawae , was the most important of all . <p> They let him go to the Jets , where he became the anchor of the NFL 's most improved offensive line . To replace him , they signed the aging Kevin Glover , who got hurt , and left a gaping hole in the middle . <p> The result : Dennis Erickson was gone after his third 8-8 season in four as Seahawks coach . <p> The Jets , meanwhile , augmented Mawae selectively , with expensive restricted free agent Curtis Martin from New England , and with Vinny Testaverde and Bryan Cox off the scrap heap . There were no high hopes for Cox and Testaverde - Glenn Foley started the season at quarterback - but both came though and the Jets are the season 's biggest surprise . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' success was n't a free agent , but rookie , fourth-round draft choice Jason Fabini , a very pleasant surprise as a starter at right tackle . <p> Then there 's Washington , which committed $ 59 million to Dana Stubblefield and Dan Wilkinson to plug the most severe hole - on the defensive line . The Redskins started 0-7 , Stubblefield was fair and Wilkinson did n't show up until Stubblefield was hurt and the season was down the drain . <p> There are big names out there this year , with Green Bay receiver Antonio Freeman perhaps the biggest . <p> Yes , they 'll command big bucks . But they 're not always the answer . <p> DRAFT DOINGS : The first pick in the draft will almost surely be Tim Couch based on the answer to an obvious question : Do you build a team around a quarterback or running back ? <p> A quarterback , of course , particularly for the new Cleveland Browns . So they almost have to take Couch , unless they somehow come up with a free-agent quarterback or trade the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson . That could be an option if Brian Billick the Vikings ' offensive coordinator , becomes their coach . <p> That leaves Ricky Williams to Philadelphia , but it also leaves the Eagles without a quarterback ... unless THEY trade their pick for Johnson . <p> But there are quarterbacks in this draft : Daunte Culpepper of Central Florida , Donovan McNabb of Syracuse , Cade McNown of UCLA , Akili Smith of Oregon , plus Michael Bishop of Kansas State , who may go later than Round 1 and start out as a " Slash . " <p> Making any quarterback an immediate starter is a risk for teams . Peyton Manning and Charlie Batch did OK this season , Ryan Leaf was a disaster . <p> The way it looks now , there will be several defensive impact players who will go high in the draft : linebackers Chris Claiborne of Southern Cal and Jevon Kearse of Florida , both of whom declared this week , and cornerback Chris McAlister of Arizona . <p> Add wide receivers Torry Holt of North Carolina State , if his knee checks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have a pretty good top of the draft . <p> Boston presents a peculiar problem . His father is an NFL official and the league has already decided he wo n't work any games involving his son . <p> FRIED RICE : Jerry Rice , the best receiver ever , is taking a lot of heat in San Francisco for what is perceived as his whining over lack of attention . Last Sunday , for example , his only catch came late in the game , the controversial reception in which the ball came loose as he was tackled , but was not ruled a fumble . <p> This week , after a locker-room tirade at a long-time Bay Area columnist , he agreed to sit down with T.J. Simers of the Los Angeles Times , even after Simers made it clear he would ask negative questions . <p> At one point in the interview Simers said to Rice : " You 've lost a step . Admit it . " <p> Rice would n't . <p> " Come on , " Simers prodded , " you 've lost a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my other knee hurts . " <p> " Then you 've lost a step , " Simers replied . <p> Rice has always been standoffish . He admits he does n't know how teammates like Steve Young and Tim McDonald are always accessible and articulate . <p> But after the Simers interview , he went straight to his locker and made himself accessible to everyone . <p> DEALING WITH THE MEDIA : Minnesota 's Randy Moss , who might surpass Rice in 15 years , is starting off just as standoffish . <p> Three times he was asked to talk about being chosen offensive rookie of the year - hardly a negative interview - and three times he refused . And he told a reporter who waited around a week to talk to him that he would n't because , " You 're not TV . " <p> On the other hand , the Jets ' Keyshawn Johnson made a point of telling print reporters that he enjoys talking to them because they 're in the locker room every day and work at their craft . <p> " Those TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever they want , " he added .
