<p> Boston , New York , Vegas , L.A. Salmon , sea bass , quiche , torte . The big cities and elegant menus whiz by in a blur , but one constant shines like a beacon in the schedule of Vice President Gore : the money . <p> As Gore turns his attention to the next presidential campaign  --  his own  --  he is precariously balanced between the imperative to raise megabucks and the new reality that every check and every event poses the potential for a public relations fiasco . <p> In the wake of the fund-raising controversies over the 1996 Clinton-Gore reelection effort , the matter of how and where politicians get the money they need to run is under a microscope as never before . <p> For Gore , the situation is particularly acute . As the Democratic heir apparent , he would be subject to increased attention under normal circumstances . But his zealous fund-raising for the 1996 campaign , including making fund-raising calls from the White House , a disastrous decision to appear at a Buddhist temple and his ties to indicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be even more intensely scrutinized . <p> The contrast was drawn in stark relief recently . <p> On Wednesday , March 11 , Republican Lamar Alexander , who is running for president , played host to a dinner in Nashville that raised $ 3.5 million for his political action committee . He did it in relative obscurity . Three days later , Gore attended a fund-raiser in Boston under the watchful eye of 10 news outlets . <p> After a public life so squeaky clean it sometimes bordered on bland , Gore may find that his role as " solicitor in chief " during the last campaign is the one controversy that could haunt him . <p> The report issued last month by the GOP majority of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee , which investigated allegations of fund-raising abuses during the 1996 presidential campaign , asserted that the Clinton White House  --  including the vice president  --  conducted a well-coordinated and highly successful effort " to violate the letter and the spirit of federal campaign laws . " More specifically , the report criticized Gore for his lack of candor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event was a fund-raiser . <p> Gore aides dismissed the report as a partisan attack , but Republicans are counting on long-term political fallout for the vice president . <p> " He himself is being very cautious , " said Rep. Loretta Sanchez ( D-Calif. ) , who collected $ 250,000 for her reelection campaign at a fund-raising lunch in Orange County with Gore last Friday . " His team has been very strict on the protocol of the fund-raiser . They 're cautious and rightly so . " <p> Yet no one is under greater pressure to generate big bucks than the vice president . Raising money is the traditional job of the No. 2 man , and with his party deeply in debt and struggling to regain congressional and gubernatorial seats , the demands on Gore are especially great this year . <p> More important for Gore , his fund-raising for Democratic causes is intended to cultivate and cement a wide network of donors he hopes will contribute to his newly formed political action committee and eventually fuel a presidential bid in 2000 . While the money raised by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will not be transferred to a presidential campaign committee , the PAC offers Gore 's political team the opportunity to revive his personal fund-raising organization and begin to build up a list of donors for 2000 . Experts predict that presidential candidates will need to raise at least $ 20 million by the beginning of the election year . <p> When the fund-raising controversy erupted last year , " a lot of people around Gore got real nervous , " said Peter Kelly , a top Democratic fund-raiser and Gore ally . But just as he did in mid-1988 when he doggedly retired a $ 1.6 million debt from his failed presidential campaign , Kelly said , Gore has set his mind to the task at hand . <p> " He 's in a damn-the-torpedoes state of mind now , " said Kelly , who visited with Gore on March 16 , when the vice president helped raised $ 250,000 for the gubernatorial campaign of Rep. Barbara B. Kennelly ( Conn . ) . " He 's just got to do it . That 's the reality . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So sprinkled in between the anti-tobacco forums and conference calls with mayors , Gore has been aggressively courting donors . In the past week alone , from March 14 to 21 , he attended seven money-raising events and helped generate more than $ 2 million for Democratic candidates and the party . During just 24 hours over the weekend , he raised $ 600,000 for the Democratic National Committee , boasted National Chairman Steven Grossman . <p> " He 's very much in demand , " Grossman said during a reception in Boston . " It 's very hard for us to satisfy the number of places that would like him to come . " <p> No matter how much in demand he is as a fund-raiser , Gore 's aides acknowledge he is sensitive  --  critics would say overly sensitive  --  to the criticism about his role in fund-raising . <p> Last month , the Federal Election Commission decided not to fine Miami businessman Howard Glicken for fund-raising violations , citing in part his close connections to Gore . The vice president 's lawyer fired off an angry response saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gore and urged the FEC to strike any mention of Gore in its file on Glicken . <p> To prevent the type of money scandals that plagued them last year , both Gore and the DNC have instituted new procedures for screening donors . A new compliance team checks the backgrounds of major contributors as well as anyone photographed with or seated near either of the Clintons or Gores , according to committee general counsel Joseph Sandler . <p> " Everyone involved in fund-raising learned some valuable lessons as a result of the 1996 campaign , " said Ron Klain , Gore 's chief of staff . " But the problems we had in 1996 are not going to make him do less than what he can do to be helpful for candidates . " <p> Marla Romash , a spokeswoman for Gore 's new PAC , said the PAC intends to raise $ 4 million for candidates this year and will use the same screening procedures . <p> The Republican National Committee does not routinely check the backgrounds of large donors but has stepped up procedures for weeding out foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each fund-raiser is a tightly choreographed affair , down to the grip-and-grin photo sessions with more generous donors and to the map he carries showing where to stand , walk and sit . Before each fund-raiser , Gore receives a two-sentence description of the main contributors and afterward he often meets privately with key constituents or top givers . <p> " I remember him coming to a Florida meeting and my thinking , ' Where 's the vice president ? ' " said Colorado Gov . Roy Romer , who is general chairman of the DNC . " He was up in his room meeting with people . He uses his time very efficiently . " <p> This is when Gore gets a chance to collect new names for his Rolodex and catch up with old friends . <p> " We 'll shake hands , he 'll ask for my card and then he will feel comfortable calling me up , " said Carl Feen , as he waited on March 16 to join a private reception with Gore in Connecticut . " He knows I have the ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a hierarchy to modern-day fund-raising , and Gore is adept at adapting to the circumstances . <p> When he stormed into a crowd of 400 Massachusetts activists who had paid $ 150 for a carved turkey buffet March 14 , Gore gave his " tub thumper , " a rousing partisan speech in which the vice president rises up on his toes and growls into the microphone : " Early to bed , early to rise , work like hell and organize . " <p> Later in the evening , seated at a table with elegant burgundy linens and black and gold china , Gore dined on grilled filet of salmon with apricot macadamia chutney with 50 people who had contributed at least $ 10,000 per couple . As guests such as actress Liv Ullmann finished off the meal with a ganache torte , Gore spoke of the virtues of investment capital and the vice of " hyper-individualism that discounts the importance of community . " <p> At all these events , it is clear that Gore is collecting political chits . <p> In Boston , for example , Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in raising $ 100,000 for the state party would help " mend some fences " with labor leaders who have thus far viewed House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt ( D-Mo. ) as more sympathetic to union issues . <p> In Connecticut , Stamford Mayor Dannel Malloy made clear to 500 guests the significance of Gore 's appearance , telling the vice president : " We most appreciate that you would come to our city and to our state and help us raise money for Barbara Kennelly . " <p> And the carefully scripted Gore offered a rare glimpse into the significance for him . After his remarks recognizing every elected official in the huge ballroom , Gore mentioned two other men for thanks . They were fund-raisers . <p> Staff writer Ruth Marcus contributed to this report .
