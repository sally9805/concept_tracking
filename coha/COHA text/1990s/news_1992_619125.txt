<p> Postmaster General Anthony Frank announced last week that he intends to step down at the end of February after four years running what he calls " the nation 's oldest , largest corporation . " <p> Frank , 60 , the former head of San Francisco-based First Nationwide Bank , admits that he did n't accomplish all he would have liked . He concedes that the Postal Service still has a way to go to improve employee relations and service standards . He also was frustrated in his attempt to convince postal rate-setting authorities to raise the price of a first-class stamp to 30 cents . He settled instead for 29 cents and higher bulk- mail rates . <p> He claims that much of the public criticism directed at the Postal Service is more the result of misunderstandings than deficiencies in the operation . <p> Frank has maintained his Marin County residence throughout his tenure in Washington , D.C. He plans to return to the Bay Area as head of Acrogen Inc. , a tiny biotechnology company in Oakland . <p> During a wide-ranging interview this week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Question : You often say the United States has the world 's best postal system . What 's your best evidence to back up that claim ? <p> Answer : Plain old pennies . It costs 67 cents to mail a letter in Germany , a far smaller country ; 47 cents in Japan , 42 cents in Canada . Here in this country , we get all excited about the difference between 29 cents and 30 cents . <p> You take the amount of mail we handle in a year and divide it by the number of employees , and you will see we are about twice as efficient as Germany and 30 percent more efficient than the Japanese . <p> How many American companies can say they 're head and shoulders more efficient than their German or Japanese counterparts ? I do n't know what the answer is , but we 're one of them . <p> Q : How did such comparisons change during your tenure ? <p> A : We made some advancements . We 're well on the way to reducing employment in the Postal Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 40,000 jobs already , all without layoffs , which I 'm just as proud of as the reduction itself . <p> We 're in the forefront of automation  --  the largest automation program ever undertaken by anybody anywhere . How do you automate 166 billion pieces of mail when it all gets tossed into 400,000 letter boxes and shows up in 118 million mailboxes ? How do you automate such a thing ? <p> We are doing it by putting a bar code on every single item with which we deal , which allows machines to take over most of the functions now performed by hand . By the end of this year about 71 percent of the mail will have a bar code on it , up from almost zero when I came . <p> I think we made some improvement in workplace morale , but not enough . <p> Q : Would it be fair to say that postal labor relations was your No. 1 frustration ? <p> A : Yes , but you have to break it into two parts . One is labor relations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did well on reducing our costs . . . As for the workplace , there 's still too much of an autocratic atmosphere at the Postal Service . We have to make it more participative . We are making progress , but you do n't turn around the nation 's oldest , largest corporation when some defrocked banker comes from San Francisco and says " Let 's do it " . <p> We made progress . We cut our grievances in half . There are hundreds and thousands of locations where people get along and they have no controversy ; there are other places where it 's difficult . <p> Some of it is understandable . The public does n't understand this . Over half our people work at night . That 's no fun . They do n't get the same days off every week . That 's no fun . People joke about " neither rain nor sleet nor snow "  --  but it 's true , and it 's no fun . <p> Yet a lot of these jobs are highly desirable . Nobody 's ever heard this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have a turnover rate of 2 percent a year in the Postal Service . People like their jobs and stay in them until retirement . In the banking business , we used to brag when we had turnover under 40 percent . <p> Q : Some argue that the mail would be handled more efficiently if the Postal Service was subject to more competition , or maybe even broken up and privatized . <p> A : We need to be a monopoly , but we ca n't act like it . That 's been my basic philosophy . <p> We 're charged with breaking even . We make money in some areas , we lose money in others . We provide the same service at the same price to every American . If we were to privatize , that whole thing would fall apart . <p> But we ca n't act like a monopoly . How does a monopoly operate ? Well it 's bloated , it has no push for innovation , it could care less about the customer , it 's rude , inattentive . <p> When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just coming to an end . Two weeks after I came a commission tentatively recommended the Postal Service be privatized . But since then that really has died down . <p> As long as we do the job , privatization is a dead issue . . . The better you run it , the less argument there can be to privatize it . I think there 's not a groundswell anymore . <p> Q : You 've said the Postal Service is a misunderstood organization . How is it misunderstood ? <p> A : OK , in no particular order : We do n't use taxes . I hear it all the time  --  " You 're wasting the taxpayer 's money . " I say , " No , we are totally self-funded . . . " <p> Second , people do n't understand we are as subject to inflation as everybody else , maybe more so . The American people can never understand why postal rates have to go up . Well , do you know something that does n't go up ? And our prices only go up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we do n't set our own prices . It 's an unbelievable thing . I did n't believe it either . Imagine running the nation 's largest corporation and you do n't have any voice on prices . We have an independent postal-rate commission that votes on it all . <p> People somehow think a letter is like a phone call . The difference is that we have to physically transport that letter . Between one to 14 pairs of hands have to handle it , and we do it for 29 cents . It 's really an amazing story . <p> Finally , accuracy . I can remember when I was in school , and when my kids were in school . What I prayed for , for myself and for them , was to get a 90 on an exam  --  just get a 90 , that would be fine . I never dreamed of getting a 99 percent on an exam . <p> If we only had 99 percent accuracy in the Postal Service , we would lose 5.5 million letters a day . I think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80 . <p> Q : It sounds as though you 've found it a little frustrating . <p> A : It is frustrating . . . Something like 98 percent of all members of Congress are returned to office each election , but people still hate the Congress . People love their letter carrier too , they love their postmaster , but they also love to get down on the Postal Service . I think it 's more for fun than anything else . <p> We do surveys and 85 percent of the American people rate us " excellent , " " very good " or " good . " About 2 percent say " poor . " That 's not excellence , but it 's better than anybody else . I do n't know any other institution in our country that would have a rating like that . <p> I 've always used the same words when it comes to the Postal Service  --  " pretty good "  --  which is unfortunate . I 'd like to be able to say " excellent . " <p> I 'd like nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We are doing that , we have started an experiment , in North Carolina , with more attendants at the windows and a program to separate out customers with time-consuming requests . I would like to have 95 percent of all the mail delivered on time  --  it 's 83 percent now  --  and the other 5 percent not more than one day late . <p> Q : What do you mean by on time ? <p> A : We have standards . Within 50 to 60 miles , it 's overnight . Within 600 miles it 's two days . Everything over 600 miles is three days , no matter where . Those are pretty tough standards . In Canada , the standard is two , three and four days .
