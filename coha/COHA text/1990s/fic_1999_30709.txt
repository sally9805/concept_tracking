From Chapter One Iain Maitlan He was riled now . The black mood came over him the minute his brother Patrick told him about the promise he 'd given his sweet wife , Frances Catherine . If Patrick had wanted to surprise his brother , he 'd certainly accomplished that goal . His explanation had rendered Iain speechless . The condition did n't last long . Anger quickly took over . In truth , the ridiculous promise his brother had given his wife was n't nearly as infuriating to Iain as the fact that Patrick had called the council together to render their official opinion on the matter . Iain would have stopped his brother from involving the elders in what he considered to be a private , family matter , but he 'd been away from the holding at the time , hunting down the Maclean bastards who 'd waylaid three unseasoned Maitland warriors , and when he 'd returned home , weary but victorious , the deed had already been done . Leave it to Patrick to take a simple issue and complicate the hell out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of the ramifications of his rash behavior . Iain , as the newly appointed laird over the clan , would now be expected to put his duties to his immediate family aside , his loyalty , too , and act solely as the council 's advisor . He was n't about to meet those expectations , of course . He would stand beside his brother no matter how much opposition came from the elders . He would n't allow Patrick to be punished , either . And if need be , he was fully prepared to fight . Iain did n't share his decision with his brother for the simple reason that he wanted Patrick to suffer the uncertainty awhile longer . If the ordeal proved painful enough , perhaps Patrick would finally learn to use a little restraint . The council of five had already gathered in the great hall to hear Patrick 's petition when Iain finished his duties and made his way up the hill . Patrick was waiting in the center of the courtyard . He looked ready to go into battle . His legs were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides , and the scowl on his face was as fierce as the thunderstorm brewing overhead . Iain was n't at all impressed with his brother 's bluster . He shoved Patrick out of his path when he tried to block his way , and continued on toward the steps to the keep . " Iain , " Patrick called out . " I ask you now , for I would know your position before we go inside . Do you stand beside me on this issue or against me ? " Iain stopped , then slowly turned around to look at his brother . The expression on his face showed his anger . His voice was deceptively mild , however , when he spoke . " And I would know , Patrick , if you deliberately try to provoke me by asking such a question ? " Patrick immediately relaxed his stance . " I meant no insult , but you 're new as laird and still to be tested in such a personal way by our council . I had n't realized until just now the awkward position I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second thoughts ? " " No , " Patrick answered with a grin . He walked over to his brother . " I know you did n't want me to involve the council , especially now when you 're battling to get them interested in forming an alliance with the Dunbars against the Macleans , but Frances Catherine was determined to gain their blessing . She wants her friend to be welcomed here . " Iain did n't remark on that explanation . Patrick pressed on . " I also realize you do n't understand my reasons for giving my wife such a promise , but someday , when you 've met the right woman , all of this will make perfectly good sense to you . " Iain shook his head in exasperation . " Honest to God , Patrick , I 'll never understand . There is n't any such thing as the right woman . One 's just as good as another . " Patrick laughed . " I used to believe that , too , until I met Frances Catherine . " " You 're talking like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insulted by his brother 's comment . He knew Iain could n't understand the love he felt for his wife , but God willing , one day he would find someone to give his heart to . When that day arrived , he was going to thoroughly enjoy reminding Iain of this callous attitude . " Duncan indicated they might want to question my wife , " Patrick said then , turning the topic back to his main concern . " Do you think the elder was jesting with me ? " Iain did n't turn around when he gave his answer . " None of the council members ever jest , Patrick . You know that as well as I. " " Damn it , I 'm responsible for this . " " Aye , you are . " Patrick ignored his brother 's quick agreement . " I wo n't let the council intimidate Frances Catherine . " Iain let out a sigh . " I wo n't , either , " he promised . Patrick was so startled by that agreement , he lost his frown . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change my mind , " he said . " You 'd better understand that nothing any of them do will make a difference . I 've given Frances Catherine my word , and I mean to keep it . God 's truth , Iain , I 'd walk through the fires of Hell for my wife . " Iain turned and smiled at his brother . " A simple walk into the great hall will suffice for now , " he drawled out . " Let 's get it done . " Patrick nodded , then hurried ahead of his brother to open one of the double doors . " A word of advice , Patrick , " Iain said . " Leave your anger outside these doors . If they see how rattled you are , they 'll go for your throat . Simply state your reasons in a calm voice . Let logic guide your thoughts , not emotion . " " And then ? " " I 'll do the rest . " The door closed on that promise .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
