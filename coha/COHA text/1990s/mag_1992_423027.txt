<p> The federal budget President Bush sent to Congress last week had to comply with a chilling constraint : A congressional act , aimed at cutting the deficit , freezes most domestic spending at current levels . And overall , the $76.6 billion that Bush requested for research and development in fiscal year 1993 , which begins this Oct. 1 , shows no increase over fiscal 1992 spending after accounting for a projected 3 percent inflation rate . <p> But that sobering statistic hides a key feature . Defense R &D; spending , which makes up about 59 percent of the pot , would sustain a 2 percent decrease after inflation . By contrast , civilian R &D; would enjoy a modest but significant inflation-adjusted increase of 4 percent , with several R &D; agencies enjoying a real-dollar boost of 1 to 8 percent . <p> ( Percent changes noted for all subsequent budget figures are adjusted to account for the administration 's fiscal 1992 inflation estimate . ) <p> As in the past two years , Bush 's budget planners sought to make a big splash in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' unprecedented ' interagency coordination in key research areas . Global change came first , followed by science education and high-performance computing and communication in fiscal 1992 . For fiscal 1993 , biotechnology and advanced materials and processing have gained high status as ' new initiatives . ' <p> Although Congress will likely alter Busly 's spending blueprint before appropriating funds for it later this year , lawmakers have a history of supporting increases for science . Among highlights in the President 's R &D; budget : The Strategic Defense Initiative , or " Star Wars " program , would skyrocket to $5.4 billion , a 27 percent increase . At $175 million , funding for the Human Genome Project would climb 4 percent . The Superconducting Super Collator would get $650 million , a 28 percent increase . Throughout the federal government , grants to individual researchers would rise 6 percent - to $8 billion . <p> A grants program in agricultural R &D; would jump by 50 percent , to $150 million . The administration plans to target the funds into programs on the environment ; nutrition , food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; marketing , trade and policy ; animal studies ; and developing new products . <p> Bush proposes $1.4 billion , a 14 percent increase , for transportation R &D.; Some $470 million would fund aviation R &D,; and $28 million ( a 37 percent jump ) would support high-speed rail projects , including magnetically levitated trains . Together , NASA and the Defense Department would contribute $260 million toward development of the National Aerospace Plane . <p> Space : NASA 's R &D; budget would rise 8.5 percent . Although funding for Space Station Freedom would rise 8 percent , to $2.25 billion , the President proposes to kill a mission to fly past a comet as well as efforts to develop an advanced rocket motor for launching heavier space shuttle payloads . The proposed budget provides no funds for continuing Magellan 's highly successful mission to Venus , and NASA hopes to save funds this year to keep the mission going until mid-1993 so that the craft can complete a gravity map of the planet and conduct further radar mapping . The 1993 cutoff would end the mission 1.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Research Council , the President seeks no funds for the proposed Space Infrared Telescope . <p> Materials and technology : Calling this " the age of tailored materials , " Presidential Science Adviser D. Allan Bromley described a 1993 budget of $1.8 billion to stimulate an effort by 10 federal agencies to support and expand existing programs and to explore new opportunities for all aspects of materials science . <p> The proposed budget for the new , interagency Advanced Materials and Processing Program ( AMPP ) represents a 7 per cent increase for materials science from 1992 levels . Relatively small players in materials research would get the biggest percentage boosts : NASA would receive a $29 million increase to last year 's budget of $124.5 million , in part for support of the National Aerospace Plane ; the Department of Transportation would get $15.5 million , an increase of $6.7 million . <p> The National Science Foundation ( NSF ) and the departments of energy and defense will continue to support most materials research . But a proposed decline of $16.7 million in the Defense Department 's materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials from $151.7 million to $142.9 million . Research on metals , electronic materials and optical and photonic materials is slated to climb almost 7 percent . Research on other materials , including composites , biomolecular materials and ceramics , would climb at least 9 percent . <p> After past cuts and inflation , these increases barely boost materials funding beyond its level of two years ago . <p> Enjoying a 23 percent increase , to $310.7 million , the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) would fare even better than AMPP . Its $67.9 million Advanced Technology Program includes $18 million for up to 10 new projects by industry aimed at developing technologies with commercial potential . The proposal also includes $202 million for research within NIST - with boosts of 30 percent or more for manufacturing engineering , computer systems and technology assistance . <p> National Science Foundation : In the President 's spending plan , NSF would receive a nearly 18 percent R &D; increase - enough to keep the foundation on track for doubling its 1987 budget allotment by fiscal year 1994 . NSF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturing , high-performance computing and advanced materials garnered most of the increase . The proposed budget would also allocate $48 million to continue construction of twin gravitational-wave detectors . <p> Global change : The Bush administration has long maintained that countries should learn more about global climate change before taking strong and potentially costly steps to counter the problem . In his fiscal 1993 budget requests , the President proposes spending $1.37 billion for the U.S. Global Change Research Program , a coordinated effort by 11 agencies . This represents a 21 percent increase . <p> NASA would receive 65 percent of the global change research funds , reflecting a growing dependence on data collected by satellite instruments . The administration could run into trouble with Congress over its $308.4 million budget request for the Earth Observing System ( EOS ) , an armada of sensor-laden spacecraft that would monitor the climate for a 15-year period starting in the late 1990s . Last year , Congress slashed the President 's proposed EOS budget- from $336 million down to $188.4 million - and told NASA to fashion a cheaper program that could yield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposal slates $18.3 billion - an 18 percent increase - for environmental programs throughout the federal government . With a 23 percent increase , the $5.5 billion earmarked for the Energy Department 's cleanup of contamination at its nuclear-weapons facilities would constitute the single largest environmental outlay Indeed , EPA 's proposed budget - including salaries and overhead - totals only $7 billion . <p> Within EPA , the President has budgeted a 67 percent increase , to $101.9 million , for activities to " aggressively " implement the new Clean Air Act amendments ( SN : 11/3/90 , p.277 ) . The agency ' radon-mitigation research program would also climb steeply in the coming year - 42 percent , to $5.1 million . Super fund activities would climb 5.2 percent in the new year , to $1.75 billion . And EPA 's program for investigating the neurotoxicity of poisonous chemicals would increase 2.9 percent , to $26.8 million . <p> The President proposes a 32 percent increase - to $812 million - for federal programs aimed at conserving wetlands . The new budget would also increase funding by 47 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White House calls " environmentally benign " vehicles . <p> **25;257;TOOLONG : The new budget proposal includes a $4.03 billion program to coordinate and spur biotechnology advances in agriculture , energy the environment and health care across 12 federal agencies . This would represent a 4 percent increase in total spending for biotechnology <p> In the health budget , the Centers for Disease Control would receive the largest percentage increase - roughly 5 percent , to $1.64 billion . The increase would help boost the number of children who receive - immunizations against childhood diseases ( $349 million total ) , prevent lead poisoning among children ( $40 million total ) , pay for routine mammograms and Pap smears for low-income women ( $70 million total ) and stem the recent surge in drug-resistant tuberculosis ( $40 million total ) . CDC 's spending on AIDS research and prevention would increase 2 percent , to $505 million . AIDS spending across all federal health agencies would total $2.07 billion in 1993 . <p> The President 's budget plan for the National Institutes of Health includes a 2 percent increase for research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposal would fund 5,800 new and competing research grants - about 200 fewer than funded this year . <p> Energy : Energy Secretary James D. Watkins attributed his agency 's meager budget request both to the congressionally imposed spending cap and to a reduction in " pork barreling . " A slated 12.3 percent cut in the department 's defense-related R &D; allows some other programs to grow . For instance , natural-gas research would jump 230 percent , to $40 million . Other winners include alternative-fuels research - up 85 percent , to $32 million . But fossil-fuel R &D; would fall for the second year in a row , down 7.7 percent to $825.2 million . And programs aimed at reviving the nuclear-power industry would fall almost 9 percent , to $344.7 million . High-energy and nuclear physics programs would remain essentially flat at $984 million , while biological and environmental research would rise 9 percent , to $384.7 million . TABLE TABLE TABLE <p> Shading denotes budgets which , after accounting for inflation , would lose ground in comparison with last year 's levels . <p> ' Derived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not include Energy Department 's defense programs <p> FEDERAL R &D; BUDGET : LOOKING GOOD IN ' 92 <p> Despite a recession and an overall 4 percent cap on increases in discretionary domestic spending , federal research agencies fared remarkably well in the budget that Congress appropriated last fall for the 1992 fiscal year , which began last Oct. 1 . Lawmakers allocated $74.6 billion for R &D,; a 6.8 percent increase over the fiscal 1991 budget after accounting for an estimated 4.2 percent rate of inflation . <p> Political battles and financial compromises that shaped the current year 's R &D; budget began a year ago , when President Bush outlined his blueprint for federal spending ( SN : 2/9/91 , p.87 ) . <p> Bucking a recent trend , Congress boosted defense R &D; more than it did civilian research spending , Albert H. Teich and his colleagues note in the American Association for the Advancement of Science 's annual budget analysis , released last month . The $44.1 billion for defense R &D; represented a 6.9 percent jump , after accounting for inflation and 1 percent more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the redesigned Strategic Defense Initiative , up $1.2 billion from fiscal 1991 . By contrast , civilian R &D; received $30.8 billion , 1 percent less than the 5.5 percent increase Bush requested . <p> Nearly every agency received R &D; increases - which usually exceeded inflation and often matched the President 's blueprint . The National Science Foundation emerged as a key winner , with an inflation-adjusted R &D; in-crease of 11.9 percent . ( The administration had sought an even heftier hike , but lawmakers shifted some proposed R &D; funds to NSF education activities . ) <p> Even many " losers " showed a modest increase . Amid criticism over several space agency programs , including development of new weather satellites and Space Station Freedom , NASA 's spending limit rose to $8.6 billion - 0.9 percent beyond inflation , but nearly 11 percent less than Bush had proposed . <p> Adjusting for inflation , Congress gave the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) a 5 percent R &D; increase , about $200 million more than the President sought - but with a catch . NIH ca n't spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( including items other than R &D,; such as salaries ) , until Sept. 30 , the last day of fiscal 1992 . The maneuver effectively pushes spending of that sum into fiscal 1993 . Congress imposed this constraint to ensure that the Department of Health and Human Services , which includes NIH , will not exceed its fiscal 1992 budget ceiling . <p> Among big winners in the NIH budget : Research on aging won a 20 percent increase over the 1991 level ( mostly for Alzheimer 's disease studies ) ; support for cancer research jumped 16 percent and funding for NIH 's portion of the Human Genome Project increased 21 percent , to $105.3 million . <p> Among Energy Department programs , Congress more than doubled spending on the Superconducting Super Collator . However , this $473.7 million total constitutes some $49 million less than the President requested . At $169.9 million , solar energy funding shows a hefty 32.7 percent increase . Though Congress again quashed the President 's efforts to severely limit coal research , its inflation-adjusted appropriation for fossil-energy R &D; ( including coal ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While many researchers have criticized Space Station Freedom , saying it holds little scientific merit and will siphon scarce funds from other space science projects , Congress awarded this program the full $2 billion the President had sought - an increase of 2.5 percent . However , budget constraints forced NASA to kill plans for a solar observatory and a satellite-based biomedical research program called Lifesat . <p> Austere appropriations imposed a one-year delay in plans for several missions , including an orbiting X-ray telescope and the Cassini mission to Saturn . Congress also capped support for NASA 's Earth Observing System - designed to monitor climate changes from space - at $11 billion through the year 2000 . Lawmakers called for a review of the program to ensure it could provide needed data to research agencies . <p> ILLUSTRATION : Artist 's conception of space station . ( NASA ) <p> By R.
