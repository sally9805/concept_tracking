Jazz saxophonist Joshua Redman is touring to promote his new album , Timeless Tales ( for Changing Times ) . <P> Q : You doing a lot of interviews ? <P> A : I 'd say only about 10% of my profession is making music . The rest is trying to get to the gig and make the gig happen . <P> Q : Saying gig is just so cool , is n't it ? <P> A : That 's why I became a jazz musician . You ca n't really say you got a gig if you work on Wall Street . <P> Q : You play Eleanor Rigby on the album . Did n't you learn from Frank Sinatra that covering Beatles songs is a mistake ? <P> A : To me a good song is a good song , wherever it comes from . <P> Q : So Eleanor Rigby is one of your favorite songs ? <P> A : Yeah , it is . But there are plenty of my favorite songs that would never have made it on this album . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't have thought about touching that with a 1,000-ft. pole . <P> Q : Because it would n't work , or because I 'd be all over you ? <P> A : You are all over me anyway . There are some songs that in the way they were originally played , they refuse to allow for any other interpretations . <P> Q : You 've played with the Rolling Stones and Big Daddy Kane . Who was tougher ? <P> A : They were all really cool . No one was really tough . With Big Daddy Kane we spent four hours in the studio before I even had to pick up my saxophone . But that was n't tough . That was just a waste of time . <P> Q : You ca n't mess with Big Daddy Kane when he 's chillin ' . <P> A : No . That definitely was n't my place . I waited for him to point , I played , and I got out of the studio . <P> Q : In fact , you probably should n't have even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah . You should n't print it . <P>  --  By Joel Stein
