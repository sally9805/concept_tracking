DELL COMPUTER 'S METEORIC RISE TO THE TOP ranks of the personal-computer industry has kept rivals wondering for some time how the manufacturer has managed to sustain its miraculous climb . Then a Wall Street analyst claimed he had the answer : the PC maker 's ascent had less to do with miracles than with some sleight-of-hand accounting . In a blistering report to investors , David Korus of Kidder , Peabody charged that Dell accounted improperly for foreign- currency trades and suggested that currency speculation may have been used to inflate the company 's profits . The report touched off a wave of nervous selling in Dell stock . It also touched a nerve at Dell . The company issued a scathing denial of Korus ' allegations . " Management 's intent was for hedging , " said Dell about the trades , " not for speculative gain . " The Austin , Texas , manufacturer has threatened to file lawsuits against Korus and his firm . In addition , it called for an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
