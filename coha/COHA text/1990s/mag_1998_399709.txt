New and Exciting Things Begin to Happen to the Alden Children Headnote WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE Headnote Jess , Henry , Violet , and Benny Alden , four orphaned children , are running away , thinking that their grandfather is coming to claim them . Although they have never seen him , they believe him to be a cruel man . They spend one night with the bakers wife , but overhear her tell her husband to take the youngest boy Benny to an orphans home . She plans to keep the others to work for her . This makes them decide to run away . After traveling on foot for two nights , they reach a wood and go to sleep on beds of pine needles . They are so tired that they are still sleeping when a violent thunderstorm comes up . // PART II A NEW HOME When Jess opened her eyes , it was ten o'clock in the morning . She sat up and looked all around her . She could dimly see the opening where they had come into the woods . She looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Then she looked up at the sky . At first she thought it must still be night , and then she realized that the darkness was caused by the approaching storm . " Whatever shall we do now ? " demanded Jess of the howling wind . She got up and looked in every direction for shelter . She even walked quite a little way into the woods , and down a hill . And there she stood , not knowing what to do next . " I shall have to wake up Henry , " she said at last . " Only I hate to ! " As she spoke she glanced into the forest , and her feet felt as if they were nailed to the ground . She could not stir . Faintly outlined among the trees , Jess saw an old railroad freight or boxcar . Her first thought was one of fear ; her second was hope for shelter . As she thought of shelter , her feet moved , and she stumbled toward it . It really was a boxcar . It stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead leaves . Then the thunder cracked overhead . Jess came to her usual senses and started back to Henry , flying like the wind . He was awake , looking anxiously overhead . He had not noticed that Jess was missing . " Come ! " panted Jess . " I 've found a place ! Hurry , hurry ! " Henry did not stop to ask questions . He picked up Benny , telling Violet to gather up the hay . And then they ran headlong through the thick underbrush in Jess 's wake , seeing their way only too well by the sharp flashes of lightning . " It 's beginning to sprinkle ! " gasped Henry " We 'll get there , all right , " Jess shouted back . " It 's not far . Be all ready to help me open the door when we get there ! " By sheer good fortune a big tree stump stood under the door of the boxcar , or the children never could have opened it . As it was , Jess sprang up on the stump and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Together they rolled back the heavy door . " That 's enough , " panted Jess . " I 'll get in , and you hand Benny up to me . " " No , " said Henry quietly . " I must see first if anyone is in there . " " But it will rain ! " protested Jess . " And nothing in there will hurt me . " But she knew it was useless to argue with Henry , so she hastily groped in the bag for the matches and handed them to her brother . It must be confessed that Jess held her breath while Henry struck one and peered about inside the car . " All 's well ! " he reported . " Come in , everybody ! " Violet passed the hay up to her brother , and crawled in herself Then Jess handed Benny up like a package of groceries and , taking one last look at the angry sky and waving trees , she climbed in after him . The two children managed to roll the door back so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But at that very instant it broke with a vengeance . It seemed to the children that the sky would split open , so sharp were the cracks of thunder . But not a drop of rain reached them in their roomy retreat . They could see nothing at all , for the boxcar was tightly made , and all outside was nearly as black as night . Through it all , Benny slept on . Presently the thunder grew fainter , and rumbled away down the valley , and the rain spent itself Only the drip from the trees on the top of the car could be heard . Then Henry ventured to open the door . He knelt on his hands and knees and thrust his head out . In an instant Jess and Violet were looking over Henry 's shoulder . " How different everything looks with the sun shining ! " exclaimed Jess . " Things will soon be dry at this rate . " " It must be about noon , " observed Henry looking at the sun . And as he spoke the faint echo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry ! " said Jess sharply . " Let 's live here ! " " Live here ? " repeated Henry dully . " Yes ! Why not ? " replied Jess . " Nobody uses this car , and it 's dry and warm . We 're quite far away . And yet we are near enough to a town so we can buy things . " " But- " began Henry . " Please , Henry , " said Jess excitedly . " I could make this old boxcar into the dearest little house , with beds , and chairs , and a table-and dishes- " " I 'd like to live here , too , " said a determined little voice from the corner , " but I do n't want to , unless- " " Unless what ? " asked Henry , panic-stricken . " Unless I can have my dinner , " Benny finished anxiously " We 'll have something to eat right away , old fellow , " said Henry , thankful it was no worse . He himself was beginning to see what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last loaf of bread into four pieces , but alas , it was very dry . The children were so hungry that they tore it with their teeth like little dogs , but Benny was nearly crying . He did not actually cry , however , for just at the crucial moment Violet started a funny story about Cinnamon Bear eating bread crusts out of the ash can . " He ought to have milk , " said Jess quietly to Henry " He shall have milk , " replied Henry . " I 'll go down the railroad track to the town and get some . " Jess counted out a dollar in ten dimes and handed it to Henry . " By the time our four dollars are gone , you will have some work to do , " she said . All the same Henry did not like to begin his trip . " How I hate to leave you alone , Jess ! " he said miserably " Oh , do n't you worry , " began Jess lightly . " We 'll have a surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and see ! " And she nodded her head wisely as Henry walked slowly off through the woods . The moment he was out of sight , she turned to Benny and Violet . " Now , children , " she said , " what do you think we 're going to do ? Do you know what I saw over in the sunny part of the woods ? I saw some blueberries ! " " Oh , oh ! " cried Benny , who knew what blueberries were . " Ca n't we have some blueberries and milk ? " " We certainly- " began Jess . But the sentence never was finished , for a sharp crackle of dry leaves was heard . Something was moving in the woods . " Keep still ! " whispered Jess . Benny obeyed . The three children were as motionless as stone images , huddled inside the boxcar . Jess opened her mouth in order to breathe at all , her heart was thumping so wildly . She watched like a cat through the open door , in the direction of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parted , and out crawled a dog . He was an Airedale and was pulling himself along on three legs , whimpering softly . Jess drew a long breath of relief , and said to the children , * 1t 's all right . Only a dog . But he seems to be hurt . " At the sound of her voice , the dog lifted his eyes and wagged his tail feebly . He held up his front paw . " Poor doggie , " murmured Jess soothingly , as she clambered out of the car . " Let Jess see your poor , lame paw . " She approached the dog carefully , for she remembered that her mother had always told her never to touch a strange dog unless he wagged his tail . But this dog 's tail was wagging certainly , so Jess bent over without fear to look at the paw . An exclamation of pity escaped her when she saw it , for a sharp thorn had been driven completely through one of the cushions of the dog 's paw , and around it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fix that , " said Jess briskly . " But taking the thorn out is going to hurt you , old fellow . " The dog looked up at her as she laid his paw down , and licked her hand . " Come here , Violet and Benny , " directed Jess . She took the animal gently in her lap and turned him on his side . She patted his head and stroked his nose with one finger , and offered him the rest of her bread crust , which she had put in her apron pocket . The dog snapped it up as if he were nearly starved . Then she held the soft paw firmly with her left hand , and pulled steadily on the thorn with her right hand . The dog did not utter a sound . He lay motionless in her lap , until the thorn suddenly let go and lay in Jess ' hand . " Good , good ! " cried Violet . " Wet my handkerchief , " Jess ordered briskly Violet did so , dipping it in the running brook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot paw , and gently squeezed it against the wound , the dog meanwhile trying to lick her hands . " We 'll surprise Henry , wo n't we ? " laughed Benny delightedly . " Now we 've got a dog ! " " To be sure , " said Jess , struck with the thought , " but that is n't what I intended for a surprise . You know I was intending to get a lot of blueberries , and maybe find some old dishes . " " Ca n't we look while you hold the dog ? " asked Violet anxiously " Of course you can , Pet ! " said Jess . " Look over there by those rocks . " Benny and Violet scrambled through the underbrush to the place Jess pointed out , and investigated . But they did not hunt long , for the blueberries were so thick that the bushes almost bent over with their weight . " Oh , Jess , " screamed Benny , " you never saw so many in your life ! What 'll we pick them into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Jess , who noticed that Benny was already " picking into " his own mouth . But that 's just as well , she thought . Because he wo n't get so hungry waiting for the milk . She watched the two children a moment as they dropped handfuls of the bluish globes on the towel . Then she carefully got up with her little patient and went over and sat down in the center of the patch . The berries were so thick she did not have to change her position before the towel had over a quart . " Oh , dear , " sighed Jess . " I wish I could hunt for some dishes so we could have blueberries and milk . " " Never mind tonight , " said Violet . " We can just eat a handful of berries and then take a drink of milk , when Henry comes . " But it was even better than that , for when Henry came he had two bottles of milk under one arm , a huge loaf of brown bread under the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket . But you should have seen Henry stare when he saw what Jess was holding ! " Where in the world- " began the boy . " He came to us , " volunteered Benny . " He came for a surprise for you . And he 's a nice doggie . " Henry knelt down to look at the visitor , who wagged his tail . " It would n't be a bad thing to have a watchdog , " said Henry . " I worried about you all the time I was gone . " " Did you bring some milk ? " inquired Benny , trying to be polite , but looking at the bottles with longing eyes . " Bless his heart ! " said Jess , struggling to her feet with the dog . " We 'll have dinner right away-or is it supper ? " " Call it supper , " suggested Henry , " for it 's the last thing we 'll have to eat today . " " And then tomorrow we 'll start having three meals a day , " laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was . Jess , who liked above all for things to be orderly , spread out the big , gray laundry bag on the pine needles for a tablecloth . The brown loaf was cut by a very excited little hostess into five thick squares ; the cheese into four . " Dogs do n't eat cheese , " Benny remarked cheerfully . The poor little fellow was glad of it , too , for he was very hungry . He could hardly wait for Jess to set the milk bottles in the center of the table and heap the blueberries in four little mounds , one at each place . " I 'm sorry we have n't cups , " Jess remarked . " We 'll just have to drink out of the same bottle . " " No , we wo n't , " said Henry . " We 'll drink half of each bottle , so that will make at least two things to drink out of . " " Good for you , Henry , " said Jess , much relieved . " You and Benny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . " So the meal began . " Look , Benny , " directed Henry . " Eat a handful of blueberries , then take a bite of brown bread , then a nibble of cheese . Now , a drink of milk ! " " It 's good ! It 's good ! " mumbled Benny to himself all through the meal . It must not be imagined that the poor wandering dog was neglected , for Jess fed him gently as he sat by her side , laying big morsels of bread before him on the ground . When the meal was over , and exactly half of each bottle of milk remained , Jess said , " We are going to sleep on beds tonight , and just as soon as we get our beds made , we are all going to be washed . " " That 'll be fun , Benny , " added Violet . " We 'll wash our paws in the brook just the way Cinnamon does . " " First , let 's gather armfuls of dry pine needles , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been lying in the sunshine . " Jess laid the dog down on a bed of moss as she spoke , and started energetically to scoop up piles of the fragrant needles . Soon a pile as high as her head stood just under the boxcar door . " I think we have enough , " she said at last . Taking the scissors from Violet 's workbag , she cut the laundry bag carefully into two pieces , saving the cord for a clothesline . One of the big squares was laid across Benny 's hay and tucked under . That was the softest bed of all . Violet 's apron and her own she cut off at the belt . " I 'll sleep next to Benny , " said Henry , " with my head up by the door . Then I can hear what is going on . " A big pile of pine needles was loaded into the boxcar for Henry 's bed , and covered with the other half of the laundry bag . The remainder of the needles Jess piled into the farthest corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll all sleep on one side , so we can call it the bedroom . " " What 'll be the other side ? " inquired Benny . " The other side ? " repeated Jess . " Let me think ! I guess that 'll be the sitting room , and perhaps some of the time the kitchen . " " On rainy days , maybe the dining room , " added Henry with a wink . " Could n't it be the parlor ? " begged Benny . " Certainly , the parlor ! We forgot that , " agreed Jess , returning the wink . She was covering the last two soft beds with the two aprons . " The tops of these aprons are washcloths , " she said severely . Then , armed with the big cake of soap , she led the way to the brook . The dog watched them anxiously , but when Jess said , " Lie still , " he obeyed . From the moment Jess drew the thorn from his paw he was her dog , willing to obey her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The clean , cool brook was delightful even to Benny . The children rolled up their sleeves and plunged their dusty arms into its waters , quarreling good-naturedly over the soap , and lathering their stained faces and necks with it . When they were well-rinsed with clear water , they dried themselves with the towel . Then Jess washed both towels nicely and hung them on the clothesline . " Looks like home already , Jess , " said Henry , smiling at the washing . The tired children clambered into the " bedroom , " Jess coming last with the wounded dog . " We 'll have to leave the door open , it 's so hot , " said Henry , lying down with a tired sigh . And in less than ten minutes they were fast asleep , dog and all-asleep at six o'clock , asleep without naming the dog , without locking the door , without fear , for this was the first night in four that they had been able to go to sleep at night , as children should . The next morning Jess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little housekeeper . The dog watched her gravely in the doorway of the car as Jess descended to get breakfast . She walked down the little waterfall and down the brook quite a distance , looking at it with critical eyes . " This will be the well , " she said to herself , regarding a small but deep and quiet basin just below the falls . Below that she found a larger basin , lined with gravel , with flat stones surrounding it . " This will be the washtub , " she decided . " And now I must go back to the refrigerator . " This was the strangest spot of all , for behind the little waterfall was a small , quiet pool in which Jess had set the milk bottles the night before . Not a drop of water could get in , but all night long the cool running water had surrounded the bottles . They were now fairly icy to the touch . Jess smiled as she drew them out . " Is it good ? " asked Benny . There he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs , his arm around the shaggy dog . " It 's delicious ! " declared Jess . " Cold as ice . " She climbed up beside him as she spoke , bringing the breakfast with her . The other two children sat up and looked at it . " Today , Jess , " began Henry , " I will go back to town and try to get a job mowing lawns or something . Then we can afford to have something besides milk for breakfast . " Milk suited Benny very well , however , so the older children allowed him to drink rather more than his share . Henry did not waste any time talking . He brushed his hair as well as he could without a brush , rolled down his sleeves , and started to town with the second dollar . " Glad you 've got a dog , Jess , " he called back , as he waved his straw hat . The children watched him disappear around the curve and then turned to Jess expectantly They were not mistaken . Jess had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysteriously . " We 'll begin here at the car , and hunt over these woods until we find a dump ! " " What 's a dump ? " inquired Benny . " Oh , Benny ! " answered Violet . " You know what a dump is . All old bottles and papers and broken dishes . " " And wheels ? " asked Benny interestedly . " Will there be any old wheels ? " " Yes , maybe , " assented Violet . " But cups , Benny ! Think of drinking milk out of a cup again ! " " Oh , yes , " said Benny , politely . But it was clear that his mind was centered on wheels rather than cups . The exploring party started slowly down the rusty train tracks , with the dog hopping happily on three legs . The fourth paw , nicely bandaged with Jess ' handkerchief , he held up out of harm 's way . " I think this is a spur track , " said Jess . " They built it in here so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had cut all the wood they did n't need the track anymore . " This explanation seemed very likely , for here and there were stumps of trees and decaying chips . Violet took note of these chips , and remembered them some days later . In fact , both girls kept their eyes open , and pointed out things of interest to each other . " Remember these logs , Violet , if we should ever need any , " said Jess pointing . " Blackberry blossoms ! " returned Violet briefly turning one over gently with her foot . " Big flat stones ! " remarked Jess later on , as they came upon a great heap of them . Then Benny cried triumphantly from behind , " there 's a wheel ! " The girls looked down , and with a glad cry of surprise , Jess recognized a dump at the foot of the hill . They found it not composed entirely of ashes and tin cans , either , although both of these were there in great profusion . It was a royal dump , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " cried Jess , " if it had n't been for you ! " She hugged him , wheel and all , and began turning over the rubbish with great delight . " Here 's a white pitcher , Jess , " Violet called , holding up a perfect specimen with a tiny chip in its nose . " Here 's a big white cup , " said Jess delightedly , laying it aside . " Want a teapot , Jess ? " inquired Benny , offering her an enormous , blue enameled affair without a handle . " Yes , indeed ! " cried Jess . " We can use that for water . I 've found two cups and a bowl already . And , Violet , we ought to be looking for spoons , too . Violet pointed without speaking to her little pile of treasures . There were five iron spoons covered with rust . " Wonderful ! " pronounced Jess with rapture . Indeed , it is doubtful if collectors of rare and beautiful bits of porcelain ever enjoyed a search as much as did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four wheels , exactly alike , probably from the same cart , and insisted upon carrying them back . To please him , Jess allowed him to add them to the growing pile . " Here 's a big iron kettle , " observed Violet . " But we wo n't really cook with a fire , will we , Jess ? " " We 'll take it back , though , " replied Jess with a knowing look . " We can pile lots of dishes in it . " They could , and did , but not until after Benny had discovered his beloved " pink cup . " It was a tea cup with a wreath of gorgeous roses on it . Jess made a cushion for it out of grass and laid it on top of the kettle full of treasures . All the things , even the wheels , were laid on a wide board which the two girls carried between them . Children do not usually care for dishwashing , but never did a little boy hand dishes to his sister so carefully as Benny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cool little " washtub , " the three children soaped and rinsed and dried their precious store of dishes . Jess scoured the rust from the spoons with sand . " There ! " she said , drying the last polished spoon . The children sat back and looked admiringly at their own handiwork . But they did not look long . " Jess ! " exclaimed Violet , " Come and see what I noticed inside the boxcar last night ! See , on the wall , right over on the other door , Jess . " Now , all Jess could see were two thick chunks of wood nailed securely to the closed door opposite the open one . But at the sight of them , she whirled around as fast as she could , skipped over to the board they had carried , dusted it nicely , and laid it carefully across the two wooden projections . It was a perfect shelf " There ! " said Jess . The children could hardly wait to arrange the shining new dishes on the shelf " There ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , Jessie , " remarked Benny , contentedly . " So I did , " replied Jess laughing , " but I 'm going to say it again . " She pointed and said , " There ! " Henry was coming up the path . In his arms he carried all sorts of mysterious-looking packages ! ( To be continued in the next issue ) <p>
