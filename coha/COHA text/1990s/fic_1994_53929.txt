DARKNESS . THE SMELL OF grass , and wet earth , and fog . The night moved through the clearing like a river . A few distant pinpricks of stars overhead , faint and far and pale . Somewhere down the hill , the grass rustled as a mouse fled through it , but the People were not hunting tonight . <p> Eyes gleamed in the night . Occasionally , a tail would thump the ground , once , twice , and then fall still . Very occasionally  --  an act of bravado  --  one of the People would slowly , ostentatiously , lick a paw . Then stop . <p> You could smell the excitement in the wet air , the uneasiness , the fear . <p> The wind brought the distant sound of a dog barking , and the ears of the People pricked forward instinctively , but , on this night of all nights , there was certainly no time for dogs . <p> Somewhere down below , in one of the human lairs at the foot of the hill , you could hear a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixture of human talk , strange wet noises , and oddly garbled and nonsensically out-of-context phrases of the True Tongue that humans used to try summon the People who were lair-mates with them , but none of the People were interested in Food tonight , even the fattest or the hungriest of them , not even when the human made an enticing rattling noise with a Food . Opening-Stick against a Cold Round Thing of Food . After a while , the human ceased his plaintive calls , and there was silence again , except for the human sounds riding the night air : doors slamming , voices , the annoying clamoring and shrieking of the Noisy Dead Things with which the humans insisted on cluttering the lairs , the growling of the Fast Dead Things which the humans kept as slaves and actually encouraged to swallow them ! ( although they made the Things spit them up again later ) . . . but the People were used to those sounds , and ignored them . <p> At last , when the sharp smells of excitement could get no stronger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when their tails were beginning to lash with impatience with a noise like a strong wind slashing through the branches of trees , the full moon rose , immense and pale and round , its pockmarked face pitiless and remote and cold , and that creel orb was reflected full and bright in all the watching eyes of all the People who waited below . <p> One of the People stretched and yawned , showing all his teeth . His name was Caeser2 , and he was known as a good hunter , and a fierce defender of his territory . In fact , he had a bloody feud of long duration and rich tradition going with Jefferson , whose territory adjoined his own , but Jefferson sat quietly beside him now , and did no more than turn a slightly disdainful glance at Caeser 's display of teeth . This was no time for fighting , or mating , or for territoriality . The Hunter Light , the Death Light , The Night Face , **33;0;TOOLONG , was in the sky , and that had always meant the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all . <p> It was time to tell stories , under the cold , watchful gaze of The Night Face . <p> " This I have seen , " Caeser began . " I was hunting with the tom named Bigfoot , and we came to the place where all the grass stops , and for almost as far as you can see , until the trees start again far away , the ground is fiat and hard and smells of Dead Things . I warned Bigfoot that this was Ghostland , the territory of demons3 and monsters , but his hunting blood was up , and the hunting is good under the trees at night , and he would not listen . And so we went out across the hard , bad-smelling stuff . Out into Ghostland . " <p> Caeser looked away for a moment , out toward the far horizon , then turned his eyes back to the People . " We walked out across Ghostland . The Dead Stuff was cold and hard under our paws , and we could hear our claws skritch on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whined past us . Suddenly , there was a bright light , far away , but coming closer . Closer ! I froze with fear , but , in his eagerness , Bigfoot went on . There was a growling noise , louder and louder , like all the dogs that ever were born , growling at once . And then there was a light , blinding me . The light ! So bright , so close , as if The Night Face had fallen from the sky down on top of me ! Then a Fast Dead Thing went by with a roar that shook the world and a blast of wind that nearly knocked me over , and with a smell of burning . I heard Bigfoot scream . " <p> Caeser paused , and the rest of the People crept a step or two closer to hear him . " When the Fast Dead Thing was gone , " he continued , " I went back , step by slow step , to see what had happened to Bigfoot . " Caeser paused again , significantly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . His guts were everywhere , torn from his body , and his blood was all around . The middle of his body was flat , as though it had no bones in it anymore . He was mashed into the dead black ground of Ghostland , in a puddle of his own guts and blood . On his face was a look of fear and horror such as I hope never to see again . " <p> The People shivered . After a moment , Caeser said , " Then I heard it coming back . The Fast Dead Thing . I saw its light . It was coming back from the way it had gone . Coming back for me . I 'm not ashamed to tell you all that I ran like a kitten ! And ever since then , when I go near Ghostland , I can hear the Fast Dead Thing hunting for me , roaring back and forth , hunting through the night to find me . " <p> There was an awed silence , and then a young queen named Katy said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fast Dead Things . " She looked around her nervously : " Even inside the lair : There are some of them who can follow you right in , and get you even when you 're inside . My mother told me that she used to get chased by a little one that roared and whooshed and tried to pull her tail . " <p> " That was just a Small Roaring Thing " a tom named Poorer said . " The humans play with them . They 're not really dangerous  --  though , of course , it 's better to stay away from them , just to be safe . But the Fast Dead Things , now  --  they can kill you even when they 're asleep ! " <p> " Nothing can kill you while it 's asleep , " Jefferson said . <p> Pooter bristled , then licked his foot in a slow and insulting way that might have been provocation for a fight on another evening . " Yes ? Well , I have seen this . There was one of the People , her name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fast Dead Things at night , while it was sleeping . And she crawled inside the top of the Thing , because the night was cold , and it was warm deep up inside the Thing . And in the morning as I was watching a human came and made the Fast Dead Thing swallow it , and then the Thing woke up . " He shuddered . " It growled , and then it roared , and then Lady Jane screamed , and I smelled the hot smell of her blood . The human got out , and made the Thing open up its smaller mouth in the front , and then he lifted Lady Jane out . And she was dead . Dead , and cut into pieces ! Her head was cut nearly all the way off , hanging by some fur ! " <p> " Dead ! " some of the People moaned . " Dead ! " <p> A scarred old fetal tom named Blackie , who had one ear tom nearly to rags , said , " You do n't need Dead Things to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tail and made the clicking and smacking noise that signified deep contempt among the People . " Humans will do the job readily enough ! Yes , your precious humans , the things you all live with , willingly ! When I was a kitten , some humans put me in a sack4 , and threw me in the river . Ai , the horror of it ! " He shivered and shook himself convulsively . " It was dark and hot and smothering , and I could n't breathe , and then I was falling , twisting and tumbling and falling , and there was no air to breathe ! My claws were sharp in those days , People , lucky for me , and I ripped my way out . But then I was in the water ! In the water ! I was under the water , with it all around me  --  over my head ! I had to swim , swim for my life , and I nearly died before my head broke the surface and I could take a breath , and then I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground again , and all the while the water was pulling at me , sucking at me , trying to pull me down to death ! " <p> A low growl went around the circle of the People . Their eyes gleamed . <p> " My human goes in the water every day , " a young queen named Spooky said . " On purpose . She lets it go all over her ! She does n't try to escape at all ! Sometimes she sits under the water , with only her head outside it ! " <p> The People moaned in horror . " At , they are strange creatures , " Jefferson muttered . " Strange ! " <p> " But those were Rogues , those humans who tried to kill you , " a young tom named Bangers said , somewhat uneasily , as though seeking reassurance . " We 've all been chased and kicked by Rogues now and again , or had stones or Hard Clattering Things thrown at us . That does n't mean that our humans would hurt us . My humans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feed me and pat5 me whenever I want them to ! " <p> " I had humans once , too , later on , " Blackie said bitterly . " They fed me and they patted me  --  and then they cut my balls off ! " <p> Bangers hissed involuntarily , and many of the People blew their trails out to several times their normal size . <p> " It could happen to you , too , young one ! " Blackie said . " Do n't you think it could n't ! You think you 're safe with your humans because they feed you and give you a warm place to sleep , but you never know when they 're going to turn on you and torture6 you . You 'll never know why they do it , either , but sooner or later , they will . They all will . None of them are any different ! " <p> " They wait until you 're sick , " a burly tom named Hobbes said . " They wait until you 're feeling really bad , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Torture Place , and they hurt you more  --  " <p> Another tom shuddered . " It 's true ! The humans there stick things up your ass ! And they stab you , with things that hurt ! And they drain your blood out of you ! " <p> " They cut you ! " a queen named Jasmine said , her voice thrilling with horror . " They cut you open ! My humans took me there , to the Pain Place , with all its bad smells and its sick smells and the sounds of the People screaming in agony while dogs sit around and watch them , and they left me there , locked in a Box-You-Can't-Get-Out-Of , and I went to sleep , and when I woke up , my belly had been slashed open ! I could feel the cut , deeper than a cut from any fight . It hurt for a long time , even when my humans came and got me and took me back to the lair again . It hurt for a long time ! " <p> They were crouched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle . <p> " They kill People there , too , " Blackie said . " The humans kill them . And not just the humans who live in-the Pain Place . Your precious humans . The very same ones who live with you and give you Food . They kill you , themselves ! " <p> There were a few wails of protest , and the People pressed closer together , shuddering . <p> " I have seen it , " Blackie continued inexorably . " When they cut my balls off , in the Pain Place , before they took me back to the lair and I ran away , they brought my lair-mate in , an old queen named Stuff who had lived with the humans before I joined them . Our humans brought her in , and they held her down while she fought to get away , both of them held her down , and then another human stabbed her with a Pain Stick , and she struggled for a while , and then she died ! I could smell that she was dead ! They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and killed her  --  and they patted her while they were doing it ! " <p> Someone moaned with dread , and then fell silent . <p> " And that 's what will happen to all of you ! Every one of you ! If a dog or a Fast Dead Thing or some other kind of monster or demon does n't get you , then , at the end , your own humans will kill you ! " <p> This was almost too much . They pressed close together for comfort , too scared even to wail or moan now . <p> There was a crazed light in Blackie 's eyes . " I saw Stuff 's ghost last night . I often see it , after dark . Her fur is like ice , like frost on a winter morning and her dead eyes give back no light . . . " <p> The moon was high and full above them now , and it seemed to tug on their souls , as if it would suck them out through the tops of their heads and up into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would fall forever through the dark . <p> " Yes ! " a tom shrieked . " Yes ! I have seen it ! Its feet leave no mark on the grass when it walks , and its eyes are like deep pools of black water ! And one night , when everyone slept except me , I could hear it outside , scratching on the door , trying to get in  --  " <p> A huge Dead Thing went by overhead , roaring , a blazing light flying through the night sky like a terrible gazing eye , seeming to pass almost close enough to touch , and the People crouched low on the hillside until the monster had rumbled away into distance and was gone . <p> In the sudden shocked silence , Caeser said , almost with satisfaction , " The Ghostway is around us , always . " And the People shivered deliciously , and moved closer in the night , and told their stories until the moon went down , as they have for a million generations , and as they will for a million more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People are forgotten . <p>  --  In the True Tongue , the word we render here as " human " is more closely expressed as " Bad-Smelling . **58;35;TOOLONG , " although that also is a loose translation , and subject to variation in local dialects .  --  This was the name his humans had given him , of course . The True Names of the People are impossible to reproduce here , as the verbal element is only a small part of each name , and perhaps the most insignificant part , the really vital information being conveyed by body posture , the speed and stiffness of movement , the position of the ears and tail , the pattern of ruffling or twitching of the fur , and , most importantly , the hot rich smell of the anus , and the lingering , eloquent tang of urine .  --  The human word " demons , " of course , has associations with Christian theology that the actual phrase in the True Tongue does not share , but it will serve to give an impression of something both malefic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casualness , for unknowable reasons  --  if for any reason at all ; this is more vivid in the speech of the People .  --  " False Skin " is about the closest you can come to this in the True Tongue , which does n't allow for much precision in distinguishing between one sort of thing made of cloth or fabric and another ; some dialects will allow reference to blankets as " **29;95;TOOLONG . " All this is as nothing compared to conveying some sense of what the human word " river " actually translates to in the True Tongue  --  the literal " Moving Big Water " does little to convey the sense of horror and supernatural dread with which the People regard such bodies of water , as though they were an unholy and dreadful anomaly in the natural order of the world .  --  Actually , " groom me , " in the True Tongue . The People consider humans to be bizarrely handicapped creatures since they must groom with their hands rather than with their tongues . They are widely pitied for this , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  in fact , in one dialect , the generic term for " human " translates to " **44;126;TOOLONG **27;172;TOOLONG "  --  In the True Tongue , the word for " torture " also implies a sort of willful , capricious , malevolent playfulness , and a highly refined aesthetic appreciation of the pain you are inflicting ; if you 're ever seen one of the People with a bird or a mouse that they 've caught , you get the idea . <p> <p> By Gardner Dozois <p> We 're pleased to have some short fiction from Gardner Dozois .
