<p> De La Soul , " Buhloone Mind State " ( Tommy Boy ) ( STAR ) ( STAR ) ( STAR ) ( STAR ) <p> On the third album since " 3 Feet High and Rising " ( 1989 ) , De La Soul 's dizzying psychedelic hip-hop debut , the group refuses to take itself seriously even though it 's down with some of the wildest , most inventive sonic collage-making since Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention and George Clinton 's Parliament/Funkadelic . <p> A wicked sense of humor and irony prevails as De La Soul surveys the music business , hip-hop , friends and the wider culture and samples everything from Maceo Parker to a tape recording of a threatening phone call . Posdnous , Trugoy and Maseo show that the men behind the curtain can pull these storied pranks and still retain their integrity and inspiration . <p> Not only do they have good ears and eyes for juxtaposition and jive , but they also prove to be faithful lovers of language , laughter and jazz . <p> If that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next millenium . De La Soul is one magic-carpet ride that runs on its own perpetually hip notions . Martin Keller <p> Elvis Presley , " Elvis from Nashville to Memphis : The Essential ' 60s Masters , Vol. 1 " ( RCA ) ( STAR ) ( STAR ) ( STAR ) ( STAR ) <p> This year has spawned the Elvis stamp , and with the election of Bill Clinton , the Elvis president . Now comes the biggest tribute of them all , the release of RCA 's latest Presley box set , " Elvis from Nashville to Memphis . " <p> Focusing on his 16 studio sessions during the ' 60s , this five-disc set ( a followup to last year 's " The Complete ' 50s Masters " ) should prompt a revisionist look at the King . <p> The standard rock-crit line contends that Elvis really died back in 1960 , when he returned from the Army . Although he gave a face and a name to rock ' n ' roll , his real genius , however , was his voice . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proves once again . <p> Moving through the decade chronologically and skipping over the soundtrack music , the set showcases the King at the height of his vocal powers , before the drugs and fried peanut butter sandwiches took their toll . From the operatic sweep of " It 's Now or Never " ( recorded in April , 1960 ) to the majestic passion of " Suspicious Minds " ( January , 1969 ) , Elvis rules . <p> Many of the 130 remastered cuts assembled here are alternate takes , previously unreleased tracks or songs originally used to fill out EP 's movie soundtracks . These " orphans , " which range from tender <p> ballads ( " Love Me Tonight " ) to gritty blues ( " Down in the Alley " ) , are among the set 's greatest surprises . <p> Freed from the murk of tunes like " Song of the Shrimp " and " Do the Clam , " Elvis ' vocal output of the ' 60s takes on a new dimension . Next up in RCA 's Elvis retrospective is " The Essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soundtrack cuts , gospel music and live recordings ( including the ' 68 comeback special ) . It would be too much to hope for another revelation , but we can dream . <p> Laura Emerick <p> " The Donna Summer Anthology " ( Casablanca/PolyGram ) ( STAR ) ( STAR ) 1/2 ; " ABBA Gold : Greatest Hits " ( Polydor ) ( STAR ) ( STAR ) ( STAR ) ( STAR ) <p> Riding the wave of ' 70s revisionism are two anthologies that attempt to bring perspective to the careers of the best-selling pop-disco phenomena of that once-reviled , currently mythologized and usually misunderstood era . <p> " The Donna Summer Anthology " is n't as successful as the ABBA package because it takes itself too seriously . Instead of just rounding up Summer 's sexy , simpleminded hits , it offers a sprawling view of her career over 34 cuts on two CDs , which is one disc and about 22 tracks too many . <p> With her theatrical flair , open sexuality and skill <p> for reinventing herself , Summer paved the way for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You Baby , " " I Feel Love , " " Hot Stuff "  --  have held up better than some of Madonna 's early hits , despite the dated synthesizers and schmaltzy strings . <p> Producers Giorgio Moroder and Peter Bellotte created a relentless but appealing sound that 's warmer than the mechanical , digitally slick dance records that followed . Summer had a powerful , soaring voice grounded in gospel and R &B; tradition that almost made you forget how silly the material was ( it 's hard to hear " Last Dance " or " MacArthur Park " without laughing ) . But that charm was lost once she decided she was an artist . <p> Disc 2 is filled with forgettable trivia such as Summer 's duet with Barbra Streisand ( " No More Tears " ) , a cover of " Do n't Cry for Me , Argentina " and her born-again Christian comeback attempts . Yuck . <p> " ABBA Gold : The Greatest Hits " does better , with only one or two losers among the 19 candy-coated tracks . In fact , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've heard in the ' 90s combined . <p> In some ways , the Swedish quartet 's futuristic Phil Spector wall of sound was as scary as its impossibly blond manes and ultra-high cheekbones . Nothing could be that perfect . But here it is , in all its insidiously irresistible glory , on track after track : " Knowing Me , Knowing You , " " Take a Chance on Me , " " S.O.S. , " " Waterloo , " " Money , Money , Money . " <p> ABBA has been called the Swedish Beatles , which of course is overstating the case . Benny Andersson and Bjorn Ulvaeus may indeed have been studio geniuses on the level of George Martin , but their tunes were just pleasant fluff . In fact , all that sweetness might have been sickening in the hands of any other band , but singers Agnetha Faltskog and Frida Lyngstad added another dimension with their icy harmonies and bizarre phrasing , a result of not singing in their native language . <p> The result was pop from another planet , as alien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Dave Hole , " Working Overtime " ( Alligator Records ) ( STAR ) ( STAR ) ( STAR ) 1/2 <p> Anyone who makes his living in the squared circle should play Australian slide guitarist Dave Hole 's new album for sparring sessions . Then again , that could prove dangerous . Hole 's backbeat hits harder than most fighters punch . <p> Crank up " Working Overtime , " and you 'll hear echoes of the great blues-rock slide players of bygone days , including Rory Gallagher , Johnny ( " Second " ) Winter , Michael Bloomfield and Roy Buchanan . Indeed , Hole can scream with the best soloists . But his new album demonstrates a depth of feeling that goes far deeper than mere guitar pyrotechnics . <p> Hole , who will be making his U.S. debut Oct. 22 at Legends and Oct. 23 at FitzGerald 's , has been playing no-nonsense blues for guys ( and gals ) with tattoos in the western Australian outposts around Perth for more than 20 years . But leave it to Chicago-based Alligator Records to import this great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a worthy followup to 1992 's " Short Fuse Blues , " which broke Hole stateside with a rave review in Guitar Player magazine . The 11 tunes on " Working Overtime " include nine Hole originals , along with Muddy Waters ' " I Ca n't Be Satisfied " and Big Bill Broonzy 's " Key to the Highway . " The title track , in particular , is going to lead to more than a few speeding tickets with its nonstop attack . <p> As a vocalist , Hole is basically a shouter , again in the tradition of Irishman Gallagher 's whiskey-soaked voice . But from the other side of the world , Hole has developed the inflections of the great Mississippi Delta bluesmen . Maybe in a previous life . . . . <p> Jeff Johnson @x Hatching a Plot Given that Justice David Souter made his seat on the Supreme Court a liberal one , Republicans are raring for a fight on principles and for political points , if not blocking a nominee . So while Democrats prayed for a great liberal successor to Souter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting for them on the Senate Judiciary Committee now that Sen. Arlen Specter has left his ranking seat open on the committee . At press time , ranking Senate Finance Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley was negotiating with Sen. Orrin Hatch ( currently the most senior GOPer on the committee , but barred from taking the ranking slot due to term limitations for the post ) , to see if the Ute would be willing to seek a waiver from the Senate Republican Conference to allow Hatch to take the ranking slot until the end of the 111th congressional session . Hatch would then step aside , giving the ranking slot to Grassley . At that point , thanks to seniority , Hatch would take Grassley 's empty ranking chair on the Senate Finance Committee . " They would essentially flip ranking positions , " says an adviser to Grassley . What 's been overlooked is that these two old GOP warhorses are also attempting to cut a deal that would block the younger and more conservative Sen. Jeff Sessions from taking the ranking Judiciary Committee seat that under complicated Senate Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Neither Grassley nor Hatch wants to surrender a prime ranking committee seat to a younger man who could hold it and potentially be chairman within the next eight years , " says a Senate Judiciary aide . " These old dogs do n't want to go quietly . " It maybe that Grassley- who hopes to remain on Finance long enough to see landmark health care reform legislation passedand Hatch will work their deal and get their colleagues ' approval , but their actions , some believe , will have a far greater impact on the Senate and the Republicans than either man realizes . Inside the conference , where neither man is particularly popular , their actions have raised quiet alarm . " Every member is looking at Hatch 's request and Grassley 's proposed deal and wondering when it will be their time to be in Sessions 's position , and that 's a position they do n't want to be in , " says a senior Republican leadership aide . " Hatch and Grassley are so out of touch with the base of the party and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screwing Sessions , they are creating the kind of ill will among supporters that wo n't necessarily personally hurt them politically , but will hurt the broader party , " says a longtime conservative activist and a board member of the American Conservative Union . " Conservatives want a fighter in that ranking seat for a major confirmation battle . They are tired of Republicans rolling over for Obama nominees . Sessions would be that kind of fighter . " At press time , Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell 's office was being inundated with calls demanding that he step into the GOP Confer- ence and block a Grassley-Hatch deal . But there is n't much McConnell can do . " He 's not going to pick a side ; that 's not what this is about , " says a McConnell aide . But if the outcome is anything other than Sessions sitting in the hot seat , Republicans in the Senate may rue the day they gave in to the " past generation " instead of the " next generation .

Romney is believed to have committed hundreds of thousands of his own money , as well as family foundation money , to support the National Council for a New America , which will largely be fronted in Washington by House Republican Whip Eric Cantor , who is less known for policy and more for fundraising for the party . The group , which also has Govs . Bobby Jindal and Haley Barbour signed on , is expected to focus on con- servative poli- cies that can be adopted on the state or federal levels , and to serve as a platform for almost all of those signed on who aspire to higher national office .

At least one other entity , believed to be a news outlet , filed a FOIA request for information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determine if any Obama donors or other interested parties were on board the flight , which caused a panic in the area around Ground Zero and Wall Street . The suspicion that civiliansor high-ranking White House officials- may have been on the flight is the result , in part , of the involvement of Louis Caldera , the Obama administration 's director of the White House Military Office . Caldera authorized the New York City flyover , and was brought into the administration , say Obama donors and transition team members , for his understanding of the Pentagon 's inner workings , his relationship with high-powered donors with backgrounds in the defense industry , and his ties to Bill and Hillary Clinton and New Mexico Gov . Bill Richardson . Caldera served two years as Bill Clinton 's secretary of the Army . During Caldera 's tenure at the Pentagon , his choice for deputy inspector general , Maj. Gen. Larry G. Smith , was scuttled after it was revealed that an alleged sexual harassment complaint against him had been removed from his personnel record . Caldera , who served in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chancellor of the California state university system . It was this background that allowed Gov . Richardson to press for Caldera to be brought on as president of the University of New Mexico . Caldera was not considered a top-tier candidate for that post until Richardson 's start* inserted a requirement that the president must have a top security clearance . According to former Clinton administration sources , that requirement almost ensured the only qualified candidate would be Richardson 's friend Caldera . In the end , he stayed in the post for only about two years . Caldera 's controversial background does n't end there . In 2002 , Caldera was placed on the board of IndyMac , before its failure and placement in receivership due to its poor capitalization as a result of poor mortgage investments . IndyMac Bank was the largest savings and loan in Southern California and the seventh-largest mortgage originator in the United States .

" And the thing about Rahm is that he 's not afraid to push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be surprised if Caldera is there to remind anyone of this boneheaded decision six months from now .
