<p> A few years ago , IBM 's vaunted Research division went through a stormy upheaval . But the labs have bounced back , and the future looks bright . <p> You hear Bernie Meyerson before you see him-a stream of words fired from behind his office door . Then the man steps forth : bushy mustache , curly hair , sharp eyes , a human whirlwind . <p> If there 's a poster child for IBM Research these days , it 's Meyerson . Bristling with energy and drive , he makes things happen  --  embodying the changes that are bringing the organization , once a hallowed name in R &D,; back from its neardeath experience of the early 1990s . When IBM officially dropped a long-unfruitful line of semiconductor research , he conspired with a few key managers and colleagues to go underground , borrowing equipment and calling in chits to keep his project alive . Today , the novel silicon-germanium technology his team invented is delivering processors for cell phones and communications networks with lower power and double the speed of conventional rivals-leaving competitors eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meyerson occasionally sheds his lab vestments and dons a suit  --  he has two now  --  to hobnob with the establishment . He carries a new title , director of telecom technology , and oversees more than 100 people spread across research , design , development and production . He knows the semiconductor business , negotiates deals  --  and he 's in heaven . Meyerson 's answering machine holds myriad job offers . But he 's not budging . " I could have my own corporate jet and a huge staff and all that other nonsense , " he relates . " But it 's not what it 's about . " Instead , he 's taking an idea from nothing into a business IBM expects to hit $1 billion in sales in 2001 . " Things like that " Meyerson smiles , " you kind of live for . " <p> His employers agree . IBM is hoping new incentives and a fresh outlook that takes researchers into the field to meet customers will encourage more people with Meyerson 's entrepreneurial drive . It seems to be working . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million off its roughly $550 million annual payroll and scale back basic science , Research is turning around . The division has eclipsed its old budget , soared back to near its all-time high in personnel , with some 3,000 employees , and opened labs in Austin , Beijing and Delhi , making eight in all ( see " The World 's Largest Industrial Research Organization , " p. 50 ) . Led by Research , IBM in 1998 won the most U.S. patents for the sixth year running . <p> What 's more , the rise of the Internet and the fusion of communications and computers play perfectly into decades of research  --  raw computing power , storage , chips , displays , speech recognition , " data mining " and electronic security  --  that few companies , if any , can match . Managers admit to some holes in their technological arsenal and struggle to woo talent , especially in the face of high-flying Internet startups . Still , the future seems bright and chairman Lou Gerstner showcases Research as central to IBM 's revitalization , which helped lift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's the best time to be in IBM Research perhaps in our history , " proclaims research director Paul Horn . " We had great thoughts , we had great things . But we never had the IBM Corporation maniacally focused on how they could get our stuff coming out there to the marketplace faster . " To Hell and Back <p> IBM opened its first full-blown research lab in 1945 as an act of vengeance . The company had teamed with Harvard graduate student Howard Aiken to fashion the pioneering Mark I computer , then the world 's largest electromechanical brain . But Aiken 's press release ignored IBM 's contributions , infuriating company patriarch Thomas Watson . Out to construct a superior machine , the " Old Man " renovated a frat house near Columbia University , and launched the lab . <p> From that seed sprang today 's international research organization  --  the world 's largest . Over the next half-century , a flood of technological and scientific triumphs-including back-to-back Nobel Prizes in the 1980s for the scanning tunneling microscope and high-temperature superconductivity  --  placed IBM at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poured billions into corporate coffers , the company failed to turn other Research creations into big profits . Achievements in relational databases and Reduced Instruction Set Computing ( RISC ) , for example , languished for years in IBM 's pipeline  --  only to be snapped up and commercialized by competitors such as Oracle , Hewlett-Packard and Sun . Such failures earned Research the reputation of a " country club , " whose members cared little about bringing their ideas to market . <p> It 's hardly fair to place the blame solely on Research . For one thing , IBM 's historic success with entrenched technologies sometimes made it difficult for the business groups to accept radical approaches such as RISC . And many of Research 's inventions  --  the first magnetic hard disk drive , for one  --  did get commercialized by Big Blue . Still , the division 's longtime motto was : " famous for its science and technology and vital to IBM . " In reality , notes Wolf-Ekkehard Blanz , once a physicist at IBM 's Almaden Research Center in San Jose , Calif. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " it was perfectly OK to excel in one " of those two goals . <p> Things reached a head in the early 1990s , when IBM started hemorrhaging money . In spring 1992 , research director James McGroddy focused the division more on the bottom line , establishing a new strategy area  --  Services , Applications and Solutions  --  whose members worked directly with customers on specific needs . Foreseeing a management change and worried Research might be considered an ivory tower , he also prepared a report detailing its contributions . McGroddy was ready on April 1 , 1993 , when new boss Gerstner asked senior executives for a description of their operations . Research was first to complete the assignment  --  and the Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Westchester County , N.Y. , was Gerstner 's initial company stop outside headquarters . After a five-hour tour , the new boss told McGroddy he had served on the AT &T; board and watched Bell Labs struggle to help its parent : " I want to thank you for not putting that problem on my plate here . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ division into fighting shape , McGroddy reduced his budget 22 percent by cutting overhead and axing redundant or dead-end programs-simultaneously helping Gerstner slash nearly $2 billion from IBM 's $5.1 billion annual R &D; budget . It was a painful period . Morale plummeted , many good people left . But the real battle had been won that first day . At McGroddy 's retirement dinner in late 1996 , Gerstner confessed he 'd considered breaking up the division-farming its pieces out to business groups-until McGroddy 's great first impression convinced him to stay the course . Research Reborn <p> Sitting in his expansive office , casually clad in a black mock turtleneck that accentuates the gray in his salt-and-pepper beard , research director Paul Horn is looking happy to have been saved . <p> And why not ? His division is delivering big time on Gerstner 's faith , establishing itself alongside a similarly rejuvenated Bell Labs as one of the world 's premier industrial research organizations . After 25 years of hard labor , the Watson lab 's trailblazing speech recognition efforts are taking off commercially . Two semiconductor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . The other , announced in September 1997 , involves replacing the aluminum used in microprocessors with copper , a superior conductor that makes for smaller and faster chips . <p> Last fall Almaden lab researchers , whose earlier advances in magneto-resistive data-recording technology ( see " The Big , Bad Bit Stuffers of IBM , " TR July/August 1998 ) enabled IBM to capture 40 percent of the laptop storage market , announced their Microdrive , a one-inch-square storage device bound for digital cameras and handheld computers . Then there 's Deep Blue . Even beyond the free publicity associated with demoralizing chess champion Garry Kasparov , the SP line of Deep-Blue-like supercomputers has emerged as a market leader . <p> These technologies and others are already generating as much as $25 billion annually for IBM  --  by one Horn estimate , anyway  --  and poised to do more . That amounts to nearly a third of IBM 's 1998 revenues . John B. Jones Jr. , an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney , says success stems from the high quality of IBM 's research-and its ability to shed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semiconductors , for example , Jones says IBM is " bringing their technology to market faster than the competition  --  faster than Intel , faster than Motorola , faster than Texas Instruments , faster than Fujitsu . " What goes for chips , he adds , goes for storage and other areas . <p> A few key factors account for this rejuvenation . One lies in the improved focus that comes from having survived hard times and being embraced by Gerstner and the business divisions . Pay raises , bonuses and other incentives  --  inside Research and company-wide  --  have been broadened to reflect a team-oriented approach to innovation . <p> But researchers and managers insist the biggest change is cultural . In the past , says Bernie Meyerson , " we never had the ability to do things in a timely manner around here . " That was because people worried too much about protecting their own turf , he adds , putting up roadblocks to anything that threatened existing products . But that changed under Gerstner , he says . " Lou 's emphasis is , ' Get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit . ' " Melding Many Machines <p> Mitch Stein is a big , bearded guy with an infectious smile . But confronted with the typical home entertainment center , answering machine or PC , he 's not happy . Consider the gyrations necessary to navigate these supposedly user-friendly electronics-none of which easily go together . As senior manager of IBM 's consumer systems and software group , Stein takes it personally . That 's why he 's exploring a concept he calls Life Networking , which seeks to blend computing effortlessly into people 's everyday worlds . <p> In Stein 's Watson lab " family room , " phone messages and e-mail , TV viewing , Web-surfing and other aspects of home control are integrated onto a big television screen . Stein imitates a man returning home from work . His presence is detected , lights come on , and his dormant ( but never off ) system awakes . " Hello Mitch , " the computer 's voice greets him . " Several messages are waiting for you . " <p> Although many other companies are experimenting with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , graphics , storage , processing power and electronic security ( see " The Couple That Computes Together , " p.52 ) . It was that extensive technical base , coupled with marketing clout , that brought Stein , Apple 's former director of Human Interface Technologies and a founder of five startups , to Big Blue . At a smaller company , he notes , " I came to the realization that maybe , best case , I 'd be able to do one or two point products . But I knew I would never be able to attack the whole platform . " <p> Indeed , with the help of people like Stein , IBM is seeking to wield its arsenal to forge an era of " pervasive computing , " where everything and everybody are electronically networked . And while most projects remain in the lab  --  including Stein 's effort to design a Life Networking-style home information center application  --  the company is already probing the market with a few early offerings . <p> Often , these are launched under its novel First of a Kind program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific problems in some unique way . The appeal for customers is to gain an early entry into a new technology . IBM gets to work out kinks in a controlled , real-world test bed . If things do n't part out in one year , the project is terminated . But if all goes well , the idea might be expanded dramatically , opening new areas of growth . <p> The fall 1996 introduction of **29;265;TOOLONG software provides a prime example . The company worked with New York 's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and Massachusetts General Hospital to produce MedSpeak , a specialized application for radiologists , whose distinct technical vocabulary made recognition easier . As the technology improved , IBM expanded into legal dictation and then general products-establishing its ViaVoice line as a speech-recognition force . Ongoing projects in 1999 include a PalmPilot-based electronic-shopping and data-mining system launched with England 's Safeway supermarkets , and a disaster-management effort called TeamBuilder , developed with the city of Orlando to automatically identify and alert the personnel best suited to handle different emergencies . <p> Whether through such systems or something else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But that begs another question : With the ability to create , access and transmit digital information increasing so rapidly , how can people possibly make sense of it all ? Deep Thoughts <p> One answer is what IBM calls " deep computing . " The concept comes from Deep Blue , whose 1997 rematch victory over Kasparov resulted not only from massive computing power , but from dramatically improved chess-playing algorithms as well . It 's that combination of power and approach , applied to vast amounts of data , that defines deep computing . <p> For IBM , the challenge goes far beyond fun and games . So this May , the company launched its Deep Computing Institute , an umbrella organization that pulls together 100-odd researchers at the Watson , Haifa , Tokyo and Almaden labs . By focusing these distributed talents in computing theory , statistics , computational biology , financial mathematics and data mining  --  expertise previously turned largely on scientific challenges  --  IBM wants to solve complex business problems . <p> One ambitious project under way this spring aims to combine Big Blue 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utilities meet power demands more efficiently  --  even to the point of buying and selling excess capacity on spot markets . <p> It 's a deep computing problem if ever there was one . IBM is n't known for weather forecasting . But Deep Thunder-an SP computer outfitted with 3-D graphics and powerful modeling algorithms-can often predict weather in localized areas with greater precision than anything available through government or commercial channels . The system debuted at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta , where it aided the scheduling of sailing and other weather-dependent events  --  and helped save the closing ceremonies by predicting that a powerful storm would stay 10 miles from Olympic stadium . <p> Because weather is central to determining energy demand , even conventional weather forecasts can help utilities use their generators more efficiently . In a program with a midwestern utility that ended last year , IBM researcher Samer Takriti helped develop proprietary algorithms he says can trim 3 percent to 5 percent off generating costs  --  enough to save the typical utility upwards of $40 million annually . Add in Deep Thunder 's capabilities , Takriti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's now working with Thunder researchers to do just that . At the same time , recent industry deregulation is spawning volatile energy markets  --  complete with futures , options and hedging strategies . So Takriti hopes to capitalize on IBM 's years of modeling supply-and-demand dynamics and currency trading to create a system that accurately forecasts energy prices . The company believes the fusion of weather prediction and financial modeling could be applied to agricultural industries , property insurance and other fields . <p> Even as IBM redirects deep-computing resources from science to business , another vein of research focuses on mining the business of science . An especially hot area is computational biology , which involves analyzing huge databases of biological information to unearth patterns that might point the way toward a new drug or a better crop . IBM dived into this blossoming field in the early 1990s and now has some two dozen researchers assigned to it , with scores more in related areas . One key hire was Barry Robson , who before joining IBM helped launch several computational-biology ventures and conceived a computer system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now strategic adviser to IBM 's Computational Biology Center , Robson says that through clinical drug trials and decades of genetics research , scientists have amassed stockpiles of biological data that today 's powerful computers and sophisticated algorithms can finally begin to decipher . " My passion is to really see it become an everyday applied discipline , " he adds . <p> IBM 's biggest publicly announced effort  --  an agricultural genetics program launched with Monsanto in January 1998  --  revolves around Teiresias , an algorithm that can scour vast protein or gene sequences to find repeated patterns that might code for similar functions in different molecules . Monsanto hopes Teiresias , named after a blind seer in Greek mythology , will hunt through its proprietary databases and speed the identity of genes responsible for improved yields , higher nutritional content or pest resistance . <p> The initial deal concluded this spring . Under a new agreement that runs through 1999 , IBM will also use the algorithm to look for patterns in the far larger public databases maintained by the National Institutes of Health and other government organizations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teiresias will turn up unsuspected commonalities across protein families that will enable scientists to design drugs to attack a wide variety of ailments . But Can Big Blue Boogie ? <p> Shortly after taking over as research director in 1996 , Paul Horn changed the division 's motto . Out went the phrase , " famous for its science and technology and vital to IBM . " The new legend simply declared : " vital to IBM 's future success . " Talk about shock . " He took science and technology out of the wording , " recalls Randall Isaac , research vice president for Systems , Technology , and Science . " People were wondering , ' What does it mean , what does it mean ? ' " <p> While the motto change hardly raised eyebrows outside IBM , what it spoke to has dogged the company since the McGroddy days : science does n't hold the place it once did . Cherry Murray , director of physical sciences at Lucent Technologies ' Bell Labs , pulled no punches during a talk last December in Washington , D.C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you do that , what you had is gone . " <p> Horn 's people counter that axed basic science projects involved long shots like neutrino detection , which even if successful were unlikely to impact the company commercially . Meanwhile , Research continues to support fundamental studies in key areas of physics and materials science , as witnessed by its storm of semiconductors and storage advances and its explorations into quantum computing and other scientifically risky areas where gambling makes more sense . What 's different from the past  --  the point of the new motto  --  is that science is no longer considered an end unto itself , says Isaac . " We still want to be famous in science and technology  --  but its goal is to be vital to IBM 's success . " <p> In this view , IBM has an ally in former research director John A. Armstrong . Before his 1993 retirement as vice president for science and technology , Armstrong was McGroddy 's boss . What IBM has done , says Armstrong , is dare to ask , " How much is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he adds , " is deeply disturbing to the national scene . " And though people chastise IBM for scaling back basic studies , he scoffs , " they do n't scorn Intel for never having serious research . Same is true for Microsoft , same is true for Motorola . " <p> In the end , far more serious than how much science to support are the straightforward challenges of staying nimble and creative inside a worldwide organization . Horn admits Research is n't as competitive as he 'd like in networking and certain Internet technologies , though he wo n't specify which ones . But in attempting to beef up these areas IBM must battle the perception that it is stodgy , and , well , uncool . <p> Since taking over , Horn has moved aggressively to address these concerns . To better compete with startups , an unprecedented number of researchers now receive stock options . A Watson out-building was turned into a gym . The Hawthorne lab got a new entertainment room  --  the Hawlodeck  --  rigged for video games , go and chess . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teetotaling IBM , Research now hosts " Summer Fun Days " with live music , beer and wine . Horn 's even hired an activities director to ensure summer interns have fun . <p> Horn says that these efforts are beginning to pay off in improved recruitment . But at least some potential hires have a bigger question on their minds : Can radical ideas thrive in the new environment ? Former IBM Fellow Jerry Woodall , now an electrical engineering professor at Yale University , thinks this is Research 's Achilles ' heel . In their zeal to bolster the bottom line , he says , managers have virtually eliminated curiosity-driven investigations in areas that do n't relate directly to current business needs . Such projects , Woodall believes , could be vital in the future , " the high-tech corporation 's equivalent to ' seed corn . ' " <p> Gerstner himself had the chance to confront this issue last July , when Research treated 700 summer students to a day of music and brainstorming sessions held simultaneously at its labs around the world . At the Watson festivities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to IBM for fear that if he did do something truly different and important it would never see the light of day . <p> The chairman did n't miss a beat . Pointing out a curly-headed mustachioed figure in the crowd , he replied : " Ask Meyerson about that . " The World 's Largest Industrial Research Organization TABLE <p> In addition to this physical organization , Research is divided into five strategy areas that cut across geographical boundaries . Roughly equal in size and authority , the areas are : Services , Applications and Solutions ; Computer Systems and Software ; Telecommunications Technology ; Storage Technology ; and Systems Technology , and Science . Increasingly , researchers form global teams that rely heavily on e-mail and Internet conferencing to converge on problems beyond the scope of operations at the individual labs . <p> By Robert Buderi <p>
