GOOD , GOOD , GOOD , good vibrations ! " sang the Beach Boys , echoing the notion that there 's often subliminally more to things than meets the eye . Some folks just seem to radiate " good vibrations . " We can stand next to them at the post office , and a peaceful yet invigorating aura seems to surround them . We 're buoyed by their presence . Or we sometimes walk into a situation and immediately do n't like it . Something just feels wrong . " Bad vibes , " we recall afterward . Space , I 've come to believe , is much the same . A look at Saturn through a quality telescope gives you an exhilarating feeling that is all its own and distinct from the feeling you get when observing , say , a globular cluster . Is it just me ? No way . As director of two observatories , I 've watched thousands of people view numerous celestial objects , and their reactions are consistent . These visitors have all seen pictures of Saturn far superior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still makes them gasp , " That 's not real ! " I think what people are unconsciously saying when they make such an exclamation is that the real Saturn carries a startling presence , an undeniable authenticity , that is unexpectedly different from any photograph . This vibe or feeling has to be experienced to be understood . We have no language for it . But it is n't subtle . Most of us realize that a televised birth , say , does not begin to capture the essence of the real thing . Still , this dichotomy between image and actuality seems not yet widely appreciated . Only those who have witnessed a bolide or fireball grasp the futility of portraying a meteor in a movie ; the encounter is conveyed about as faithfully as a rainbow in a sitcom . In 1980 the Indian government gave me time on the 40-inch telescope at Naini Tal Observatory in the Himalayas . One night the young staff astronomers set it up so we could we all gaze at Saturn . Suspended in space with the sharpness of a Christmas decoration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everyone jumped up and down , clapping like kids . We could n't help ourselves . Sure , we 'd all seen the ringed world hundreds of times before , but this view blew us away . I very much doubt a color transparency would have had the same visceral effect . ( Years later I returned for a reprise . But , as is so often the case , you ca n't go back . That second time the seeing caused a blurry mess . ) Recently I taught a course at a new observatory in the heart of New York 's Catskill Mountains . The facility is computerized , and the person in charge had not the foggiest notion of where things are in the night sky . To find something he 'd press a few buttons , the scope would slew to the target , and that was that . The setup allowed images to be shown on a television monitor in an adjoining classroom , so visitors could all enjoy the heavens simultaneously . On paper this seems like a good idea . But what , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturn showed up on the monitor , but its knock-your-socks-off presence was gone . You know what this is like if you 've ever been to the Grand Canyon , then later see it on television . The whole gestalt vanishes in the translation to electrons and phosphors Granted , the canyon is a special case because TV also removes the panoramic view and all-important sense of depth . But if these could be restored - say , in a big-screen 3-D movie  --  would that then capture it fully ? Maybe . I have seen the IMAX movie Grand Canyon : The Hidden Secrets . The large , sharp format was impressive but quite unlike the actual experience . OK , the banked aerial photography did succeed in making me more authentically dizzy than when I do steep turns in my old Piper Cherokee . Vertigo , at least , fully lends itself to synthetic creation . It may be that humans have mastered the ability to produce discomfort artificially , while rapture is nature 's alone to give or withhold . Perhaps planets and eclipses have different or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I 'm not about to set myself up as an Investigator of Vibes , though such an avocation would probably be enormously successful in my hometown of Woodstock , New York . I do contend that the most dramatic demonstration of image versus reality is a total solar eclipse . As a teenager I 'd read somewhere that half of all observers go verbally berserk , shouting or groaning or babbling ; it seemed that animals were n't the only creatures that act up during totality . " Yeah , right , " I skeptically thought . Yet it 's true . A televised image or photograph of an eclipse is mildly interesting , but the Real McCoy is overwhelming . In 1991 , hired as " eclipse astronomer " for a SOO-person excursion to Baja , I announced at my first lecture that I belonged to the group up to the hour of totality . But during the eclipse itself I would not be available ( which irked some of the participants ) . I knew from previous totalities that loud exclamations invariably accompany any group assembled for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there are other , more introspective ways to experience the magic . I went alone to an isolated patch of beach . I do not dispute that CCD and video cameras have become indispensable for research . And if you want to impress your techno-loving friends or visitors , let them see M13 on your monitor . But I 'd wager you will be wowing them as much with the equipment as with the globular itself For maximum mind-blow , give them the real thing . Let each of the thousands of jeweled starpoints finish their 25-millennium journey by being focused smack in the eyes rather than as translations from silicon-brained interpreters . So let 's think twice about installing video monitors when the public visits an observatory for a taste of the cosmos . Like the thick plastic my grandparents forever kept over their furniture - reducing comfortable chairs to sweaty , crinkly packages  --  monitors impose a flickering electronic membrane between us and the wonders of space .
