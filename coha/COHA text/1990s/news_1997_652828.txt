<p> " WE 'RE ALL IN A GOOD mood ! " announces Michael Kahn , director of the Drama Division of the Juilliard School , before a brief warmup session meant to stretch muscles and imaginations . ( " Pretend you 're in warm water . Pretend you 're an animal . " ) Arrayed before him at rapt attention at the Lincoln Center school of the performing arts are dozens of aspirants  --  all shapes , colors , sartorial persuasians and sizes . Over the next few hours , in an empty studio that could double as a gym , they will step forward , one by one , to claim a place in next fall 's freshman class . The odds are against them : a thousand applicants ; two dozen places . <p> Very much in charge , Mr. Kahn is also most encouraging . " Take your time ! If you lose concentration , breathe and start over . Do what you came to do . Be at your most relaxed . Know that we know you 've worked quite hard . We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 're looking for potential , not a definitive interpretation . Do n't worry if we write . Imagine we 're writing ' wonderful , wonderful , wonderful . ' " <p> " We " means the faculty , and they are not writing " wonderful , wonderful , wonderful . " <p> Every January and February , this ritual is played out anew at the Drama Division , founded in 1968 by John Houseman , the legendary producer , director and actor . Those who stay the course emerge to take their places in what may well be the most uncertain profession in the world . In past years , Patti LuPone , William Hurt , Val Kilmer , Kevin Spacey and Jeanne Tripplehorn made the cut . Someday , names of this year 's winners should be no less familiar . <p> Group XXV graduated last May , 14 actors strong . ( Classes are designated not by year but by Roman numerals , like royalty and the Super Bowl . ) Since then , all but two or three members of the class have found work on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in regional theater or in national commercials . Among the most fortunate was Christian Camargo , 25 , who was cast in David Hare 's acclaimed three-character " Skylight " on Broadway . Claire Lautier , 26 , turned down a final audition for a daytime television contract in favor of live Shakespeare in New Jersey and Rostand in Pennsylvania . Sean Arbuckle , 26 , sandwiched an episode of the NBC television drama " Law and Order " between a new stage adaptation of " The Magnificent Ambersons " in Indiana and a job at the Joseph Papp Public Theater in New York as understudy for the title role in " Henry VI . " Right now , Group XXV is doing all the things actors do : meeting with Hollywood producers , waiting on tables , auditioning , working birthday parties as Lulu the Clown and Pocahontas . <p> This is a glimpse at how the Drama Division will transform those applicants chosen during the next few weeks into the graduates of Group XXX in the year 2001 . <p> " In auditions , we like to see someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ un-self-consciously , " said Harold Stone , the program 's administrative director , a few days before the start of auditions . " That 's the hardest thing to learn . Once you 've learned that , acting is quite easy . " <p> Most acting programs last two or three years ; Juilliard 's lasts four , and costs $14,200 in annual fees and tuition , plus room and board . What is this investment meant to produce ? " Qualified actors , " Mr. Stone said simply . " The ability to make an imaginative leap is taken for granted . Then , they should have bodies capable of being appropriately expressive . A voice appropriate to the character and comprehensible . " <p> The emphasis on voice and speech at the Drama Division is proverbial and in certain circles something of a joke . " Technique is a dirty word in American theater , " said Robert Neff Williams , a former Columbia University professor who teaches speech and theater history at the Drama Division . " ' Oh ! , ' " he mocked , " ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That attitude is fueled by jealousy  --  and an old American feeling that unless you mumble and mutter , it 's not acting . " <p> The acting program of the Juilliard School , which spreads along the northern perimeter of Lincoln Center , between Alice Tully Hall and the Walter Reade Theater , is neither America 's oldest nor its largest , and plenty of the nation 's most emulated stars ( Robert De Niro and Meryl Streep among them ) trained elsewhere . Yet few would deny Juilliard 's special luster . <p> While Houseman , who died in 1988 , never intended to set up a star factory , he did have an ambitious agenda . In the 1960 's , the burgeoning regional-theater movement had need of performers capable of presenting world drama , from the Greeks to the Group . Such actors were hard to find . <p> Influential American acting programs , each claiming descent from the Russian acting guru Konstantin Stanislavsky , founder of the Moscow Art Theater , subscribed to variants of the so-called Method . Psychologically driven , emotionally volatile but stylistically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a Tennessee Williams . With Shakespeare or Shaw they failed . But if actors can do the classics , Houseman believed , they can do anything . <p> Group I , enrolled in 1968 , produced the director Gerald Gutierrez and the actors Kevin Kline , David Schramm , David Ogden Stiers , Sam Tsoutsouvas as well as Ms. LuPone . On graduation , they formed the Acting Company , a professional classical ensemble that toured widely to splendid reviews . <p> More recent alumni include Christine Baranski ( III ) ; Christopher Reeve ( IV ) ; Mandy Patinkin ( V ) ; Robin Williams ( who roomed with Mr. Reeve ) and Frances Conroy ( VI ) ; Stephanie Zimbalist ( VII ) ; Keith David and Boyd Gaines ( VIII ) ; Andre Braugher ( XVII ) ; Laura Linney and Saundra Quarterman ( XIX ) ; Michael Hayden ( XXI ) ; Viola Davis ( XXII ) . <p> Mr. Kahn , who is also the artistic director of the Shakespeare Theater in Washington , elaborated on the Drama Division 's mission : " In American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Method  --  a struggle Stanislavsky would have disagreed with . The notion is that technical training is facile and fake . And in fact there may come a time in an actor 's training where the acquisition of technical skills does n't draw from the deepest resources of one 's imagination . But by the same token , a music student is n't at his most creative when he 's learning scales or an art student when he 's learning about impasto or glazes . <p> " We say , ' Let us free you from the tyranny of lack of knowledge and lack of technique . ' Skills improve your chances for a longer career  --  when you 're not so young and not so cute and not so commercial . We impose lots of discipline ; but we also let the students be courageous , free and alive . " <p> The discipline shows in movement class ; most trainees who sweat this hard are in the Marines . But the marriage of control and play is especially striking in the studio of Pierre Lefevre , who directs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make actions and states of the soul legible through body language alone . <p> SPOTTING TALENT MAY be the faculty 's most arduous task . " When you audition as a musician , " said Joseph Polisi , Juilliard 's president and a trained bassoonist , " there 's a repertoire list . To play a late Beethoven sonata presupposes a certain skills level , a certain involvement with the art . " <p> Aspiring actors , however , just come as they are , with two prepared monologues ( one classical , one modern ) and a song . Some are armed with union cards and long lists of more or less relevant credits . Most show up with nothing but their dreams . With a faculty representing no fewer than 11 disciplines ( from the Alexander technique and physical comedy to mask work and singing ) , there are many ways to fail . <p> " It 's such a horse race , " sighed Elizabeth Smith , a British voice and speech teacher whose association with Juilliard goes back to its inception . Deborah Lapidus , an acerbic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Real talent , " she insists , " comes at you like a beacon . " <p> What the faculty mostly sees at auditions is a dreary parade of mediocrity or worse . Last year , during tryouts for places in Group XXIX , a 17-year-old ran together monologues from " Antigone " and " Lost in Yonkers " in a whining monotone . No less painful was the 27-year-old third-time applicant who dragged defeat with her like a ball and chain . <p> But everyone loved the rosy-cheeked , beefy farm boy , 17 , from upstate New York . His Romeo hurled himself on the imaginary corpse of Juliet , scarfed poison from what looked like a Vicks inhaler , expired and then blurted , " That was my first performance of Shakespeare ! " Yet no one thought he was ready for life in the big city . So he got a rare letter of encouragement  --  an open invitation to reapply . <p> When Group XXV auditioned in 1992 , about half of them were 17 , straight out of high school ; the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some said they were desperate to get into Juilliard , while others claimed they did n't care . <p> Mr. Camargo came to Juilliard from Hobart College , where he majored in art , though his real passion was lacrosse . Sidelined with a battered hip , he landed the role of Percy Bysshe Shelley in Howard Brenton 's " Bloody Poetry . " With no further acting experience , and panicky at the thought of Shakespeare , Mr. Camargo presented himself to the Juilliard faculty with something more daunting still : Satan 's arrival in hell from Milton 's " Paradise Lost . " His song was " Di Provenza il mar , " from " La Traviata , " which his grandfather ( a Hollywood contract player ) used to sing to him as a lullaby . <p> Another graduate of Group XXV is Kate Jennings Grant , 26 , who would go on to play Eve Harrington in an ill-fated revival of " Applause " that closed out of town before its arrival on Broadway . Ms. Grant had trained as a singer and pianist and had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of Pennsylvania . She had a tough time convincing the Drama Division faculty that she had n't wandered into the wrong department . <p> " I applied on a whim , " she said . " I thought I wanted to be an actress but never had the guts to do anything about it . At a party at Penn , a composer from Juilliard asked me what I wanted to be . ' A great actress , ' I said . He told me to try Juilliard . I had no idea what the program was about . It was a fun day when I came to audition . But other people had credits . I thought I had no business there . I was very , very lucky . " <p> In their fourth year , Drama Division students leave the regimen of classwork behind to devote themselves to the preparation of a full-dress spring season of four plays , classical and modern . These are presented to a ticket-buying , largely sympathetic public of drama enthusiasts . Then , as an encore , the students do a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent scouts and agents . A tougher audience is hard to find . <p> By this point , the class has been winowed down . Students who did not measure up have been asked to leave . A few have dropped out . Robin Williams was pushed from the nest after the third year ; he would have been wasted in repertory and the faculty knew he was ready to soar on his own . <p> Group XXV had its own precocious dropout . While still enrolled at the school , David Conrad , a tall , limber actor from Pittsburgh , fended off job offers for a while but finally caved in and left before the start of his fourth year . " Relativity , " the Saturday night ABC drama , has him now . But Mr. Conrad , 29 , is keeping his eye on his hometown : <p> " Do I want to be a movie star ? I would n't say no . But I want to direct , to create scripts . Iwant to create something in Pittsburgh , make it a regional hot spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move out . Theater should be for your community . " Those are Juilliard values talking . <p> CORRECTION-DATE : January 26 , 1997 <p> CORRECTION : A picture caption on page 32 of the Arts and Leisure section today about the drama division of the Juilliard School misidentifies a teacher . She is Eve Shapiro , not Deborah Lapidus .
