When East German border guard Ingo Heinrich killed a man fleeing toward the freedom of West Berlin in February 1989 , Heinrich was just following orders . " Shoot to kill " was the command for dealing with people who tried to escape across the border , and in the eyes of Heinrich 's supervisors his actions were not merely legal but commendable . Three years later , Heinrich , 27 , lives in the same Berlin , but a different government holds sway and new laws prevail . Now he is , retroactively , a felon . Last week he was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 3 1/2 years in prison  --  specifically , the trial judge said , for following the laws of his country rather than asserting his conscience . Said Judge Theodor Seidel : " Not everything that is legal is right . " <P> The principle that an individual may be bound by a higher moral authority , beyond what the statutes provide , was established in West Germany decades ago , during trials of former Nazi leaders . Like Seidel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discredited communist regime . But there are troubling doubts about the fairness of the principle or how it is applied . That was abundantly clear in Heinrich 's case : right after the verdict , the prosecution joined the defense in vowing to appeal the sentence as too harsh . <P> The idea that a legal act can be made a crime retrospectively is alien to U.S. constitutional law  --  as Senator Robert Taft of Ohio , often termed the conscience of the Republican Party at mid-century , noted in criticizing the Nazi trials . It is a " fundamental principle of American law that a man can not be tried under an ex post facto statute , " said Taft . " About this whole judgment there is the spirit of vengeance , and vengeance is seldom justice . " Vengeance is precisely the point for some Germans who have grievances against the East German state . But even if one views it as fair to criminalize acts retroactively , as a majority of Germans and as residents of other former communist states in Eastern Europe seem to feel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the justice is evenhanded . <P> Is it fair to single out Heinrich and a few others for what many did ? During the 28 years the Berlin Wall divided Germany 's once and future capital , an estimated 200 people were killed and 700 injured . Hundreds of sharpshooters were involved . Given the difficulty of reconstructing events up to decades old , only 38 shooters have been identified . Although hundreds of thousands of East Germans spied on friends and neighbors and millions were complicit in some part of the government , only about 500 people are under investigation , many for schemes involving fraud for personal gain rather than diligence to duty . For some , the trials are part of a national healing process , especially for East Germans , who lived under some form of dictatorship for a half- century . Professor Michael Wolffsohn , who specializes in German-Israeli relations at the University of the Armed Forces in Munich , says , " There can be no amnesty . For our psychological and political health , it is necessary that those murderers are sentenced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is understandable that some of those on trial may view themselves as scapegoats , sacrificed to expiate the guilt of a whole society that was never taught about this higher moral authority .
