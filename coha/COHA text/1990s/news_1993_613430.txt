<p> Dale Murphy , private citizen , has seen the glimmer of recognition in the eyes of complete strangers thousands of times . So in the habit of his previous life , he still routinely sticks out a hand and announces to the inquisitive , " Hey , how are you doing ? " And somehow , he actually means it . Which is just the way he is . Which is , simply , Murf . <p> A more popular athlete has never played in this city , and so it is perhaps odd just how anonymously he has adjusted to his new life . The chance hardly came to say goodbye . He still slips in and out of the past tense when speaking about his baseball career , which is probably to be expected . But the talk shifts to Little League , car pools and fishing , and the discussion lightens immediately . <p> In a far-ranging conversation with staff writer Thomas Stinson , what comes through after a while is that Murphy 's retirement came right on time . <p> Q : So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . Seven kids on summer vacation . Have you been persuaded it 's about time for your comeback ? <p> A : I did n't know there was this much going on at home . Nancy has had the bulk of the load the last 14 years , and it 's tough for someone who 's not too well-organized to jump right into the fray . I 'm glad to be back , but there 's a lot going on . We got some active boys . But I do n't have any comeback plans . Nobody 's called and said they 've needed a right-handed designated runner . <p> Q : And if someone did call ? <p> A : Someone asked me that , what would I do if someone called tomorrow . And I said , " Well . . . " and started to answer , and I do n't know why I even said that . I know it 's time to be back home . I have no plans . No . <p> Q : Those are the same words you used when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then again at the retirement announcement in Houston . Are you reading some internal clock or just looking at the numbers ? <p> A : It was how I felt . I wanted to get two more home runs . People were asking me all spring and I was telling people it was n't the main reason I came back . And that was true . But I really probably did n't go into it as deeply . I mean , I really wanted to reach 400 . So there was some motivation there . There was some real motivation there , probably more than I let on . <p> And if that was still the case , if I was looking at my stats - I mean , I do n't know what my career batting average is , for instance - the things I mostly know was home runs . And if they were the real reason for coming back , I would have taken my release and tried to get on as a DH or something . That just was n't the case . When I first started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there is something inside that tells you when to do things and it manifests itself in certain ways . And as you talk to those people who are close to you , it just becomes more evident it is time to make a decision . <p> When I got traded from here , I kind of forced the issue there . I went to Bobby Cox and Stan Kasten and said , " This is my decision . " When I retired , it was kind of forced on me . So there were some similarities , and in other ways , it just hit me over the head . I do n't know what would have happened if they had just kept me . But they could n't . The way I was being used , I was just using up a spot . In fact , the guy they called up to replace me ( Chris Jones ) right away hit back-to-back home runs in Philly . <p> Q : So , then , just how is retirement ? <p> A : A lot of strong feelings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I feel good and I 'm happy to be home and ready to get on to some new things . <p> Q : What is it you hoped to achieve when you started out in baseball ? <p> A : They gave me an opportunity to play first base in the big leagues . Nowadays , it just does n't happen like what happened with me . I 'd never played first in the minors . Maybe a game . One game . And it was kind of evident the way I played that year , too . I did n't do very good . But back then , they were just trying to find a place for me . <p> What was I trying to achieve ? Most of the year , I felt guilty about being there . I did set goals during the school year . School year ? See , I 'm already acclimated . But as far as long-term goals , no , I did n't really have any . When I thought I had a chance to reach 400 , I said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertained thoughts of 500 at times . You never have thoughts like that when you start out . Then all of a sudden , you 've played eight , 10 years and you think , " Gosh , maybe I can achieve some things . " <p> I think the players now are a lot more prepared than I was . They 've built up real good college programs now . Look at the Braves organization . They 're getting a lot more experience . I made one stop every year and then I was there . And I felt uncomfortable . My first year , I had a good friend , Hank Small , in AAA that year , a first baseman . Had over 100 RBIs . A great year . So they ask me to be the first baseman . I see Hank every once in a while now . I look back and think about getting a chance . You just shake your head and be thankful that someone saw something in you . <p> Q : Does missing so much of last season , the four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into civilian life now ? <p> A : It crossed my mind last year , especially when I went back to Philly in September . Someone asked if I was going to retire and I really had n't thought about that . But being home last summer was n't like being home . I was rehabbing a lot . It was n't like busting a hand or a wrist and we could have gone on vacation somewhere . But as I really think about it , yeah , the thoughts started entering my mind . I just did n't know how I was going to bounce back . <p> Q : Have you had enough time to think about what you want to pursue ? <p> A : People have been asking me if I want to get into baseball . Maybe . Maybe there is something I 'd like to do in baseball . But to be a manager or coach or somewhere in the front office requires a lot of apprenticeships . I think managing would be a blast . It 's a great game . People talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line is it 's a great game . The reason is a lot of people can relate to it . As a fan , you can see what 's going to develop . <p> But to be a manager , you got ta dedicate yourself . You 've got to go to the minor leagues and manage . I do n't know if I 'm willing to dedicate myself to certain things . Maybe there is something in baseball - because I like the game - that I could do . I do n't know . I admire those people who are out for the long haul . <p> Q : How does today 's player prepare himself for this time of his life ? <p> A : It is strange to be 37 and be " retired . " There 's always adjustments to make . It 's frame of mind during his career , how you view things , while you 're a player . Why are you there ? How did you get there ? And what happens is you tend to view it as something you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get there . It 's hard to stay away from that frame of mind . So what happens is , you start thinking : 1 , you 're going to play for a long time , and 2 , when you get out of the game , things are going to continue that way and there 's going to be Nike people knocking on your doorstep with tennis shoes . <p> I 'm not sure but I imagine my Nike contract is over with now . So you got to be careful with that because , although I 've only been out two weeks , I assume that makes things just tougher . When you 're wearing that uniform , you 're a player and that 's a great privilege . When you take it off , things change . I 'm sure everyone goes through adjustments . I do n't know if I can verbalize what I 'm going through , but I think family relationships are very important to cultivate during a career . Nancy and I always tried to remember that , as challenging as it is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , how important it is to maintain that unity . We said we 'd do everything we could . That 's the most important thing , the foundation of our family . We tried to make sure it was n't baseball . And that 's a challenge too . <p> It can be like any job . If you let it run your life , no matter what you 're job is , if you let it dictate your self-esteem , your happiness , your approach to life , when you get away from it , what do you have ? We tried throughout my career to remember that . <p> Q : How was it possible for a man to spend a 17-year career in such a good mood ? <p> A : I had some good moods and some not-so-good moods sometimes the last few years . It 's the kind of thing , when you 're hitting .300 , everything 's great . Mike Schmidt told me once not to read the papers unless you 've had three hits . And it 's interesting . Right after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went back to my room and the phone rings . It 's Mike Schmidt . And he says , " So you 're still a member of the Rockies , huh ? " And I said , " Well . Funny you should ask . . . " <p> Q : You 've built the new farm in Newnan . Do the the Murphys intend to remain in the area ? <p> A : Yeah . We really enjoy it . This has been a great place to live . <p> Q : Is eight children enough ? <p> A : Well , I think so . <p> Q : Tell the truth . Do you have trouble keeping names straight ? <p> A : Oh , yeah . Usually when you go to get someone , you go through the first three names before you get down to the one you want . Like I tell everyone , there 's a lot going on in that house . <p> Q : I 've read comments from Nancy that you were planning on doing some fishing . Just how long has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got ta learn first . I was n't a pitcher . I do n't know how to golf or fish . I always would get on something and read about it but I never had time to really develop any hobbies , like the pitchers seem to . I 'll try to golf and fish a little bit . <p> Q : It 's hard to picture you in the backyard with a bonsai garden . <p> A : I have enjoyed gardening . I have n't done much , but I 'd like to try . But there 's not going to be anything that 's a major commitment . A guy came up to me once . . . and this does n't have anything to do with anything . . . but he told me about a pitcher . It might have been Denny Lemaster . He carves ducks and he 's doing tremendous . He probably developed that sort of thing . That 'd be fun . But there 's nothing like that I 've developed a yen for . <p> Q : What about Little League @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some respect . It 's crossed my mind , high school or college . But I do n't know . I do n't have a degree . But being involved with the kids , that 'd be great . <p> Q : Humor seems out of favor in clubhouses now . How did you retain yours ? <p> A : I do n't know . I 've always felt it was good to be able to laugh at yourself , or at least not take mistakes and bad games too seriously . I think I took things probably more seriously than I appeared on the outside . I tried to have a calm demeanor out there , but I was intense . <p> It 's hard not to take it too seriously . You make a lot of money . Everybody knows how much you make . There 's a lot of people out there watching you play . It 's hard not to get down on yourself and lose some perspective on what you 're doing . You also do n't want people to think you 're goofing around , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you relaxed . That 's kind of the way baseball players are . Everyone 's kind of nervous . You need someone to loosen you up a little bit . I 'm not a clubhouse comedian , but I tried to look at the humorous side . <p> Q : That seems to be increasingly difficult for a number of today 's players . <p> A : I had my moments when I 'd come in after the game and go into the training room , when I did n't feel like talking . That 's one thing . If players do n't feel like talking , they really should n't . I never had a problem with that , but if you are going to talk , you got to realize both sides - media and players - need to have a little respect for one another . I did n't like answering questions after I 'd messed up , and there were times I 'm sure when I was n't in that good a mood . <p> Q : Do you ever remember just losing it ? <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe not going into exact details , as much as I could have if I 'd , say , hit a home run . It 's right after a game . We do take it seriously . We want to do well . We want to win and it 's not easy . It 's like being an actor . You do well , you get good reviews . If you do n't , you get bad reviews but you try to go about your business . I guess I had a bad stretch in ' 89 . I made some errors and messed up some things and remember guys coming over saying I did n't feel like talking . <p> Q : Do you have advice to today 's Barry Bondses and Ken Griffeys , who are really having trouble co-existing ? <p> A : Those two guys are way up here and they 're constantly getting this attention . Now , they generate a lot of that attention , and I think if you 're going to generate that attention and invite it , then maybe you ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never really generated or expected or wanted . I always felt there has to be a mutual respect . The only difference between you and the person you 're talking to is you 're wearing a baseball uniform . That 's one thing I tried to remember . <p> Q : You said players do n't traipse their way into the majors like you did anymore . How has the game changed that way ? <p> A : There is so much more going on now . Back when I used to play laughter , we did n't sign that many autographs . We just signed a few and went out for BP . There so much more attention now . There 's ESPN , there 's all these games on TV . Nightly , your highlights or all your errors are all across the world . The exposure is just completely different . Full pages in the paper every day . That 's different . And that 's not always the easiest thing to handle , to get used to . When it started , it was a major thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every night , it seems like . <p> Q : With the trend in salaries , the new TV packages , a new labor agreement and some troubling attendance patterns , is baseball sick ? <p> A : After coming from Denver , you 're asking the wrong guy . They 're so excited to have baseball . But I think there 's always going to be some fluctuations in things . There are some ways , particularly in basketball , for marketing that puts the game into kids ' minds , which is very good for the game , that baseball maybe is n't doing . Now one of the reasons for that is you do n't sell a lot of baseball shoes to children , and that 's something baseball has to remember . If Nike was selling baseball shoes like they sell basketball shoes , you would n't have a Michael Jordan but guys like Kirby Puckett , Cal Ripken , guys like that would be everywhere . But that 's not a big-money sell , so they do n't spend a lot of time pushing those athletes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then if you start promoting some guys , there 's no salary cap in baseball , so that means you 're going to have to pay guys more . Basketball has more of a partnership between players and owners , but that happened because basketball a while ago was really struggling . Is baseball struggling like that ? I do n't know . <p> Q : Knowing what you know now , would you encourage your kids to pursue baseball as a livelihood , if they 're good enough . <p> A : Yeah , yeah . If it 's something they want to do . <p> Q : How do the kids coming up today seem different than you were when you started out ? <p> A : It goes back to being exposed to so much , as far as what 's available to them if they hang around four or five years . When I got drafted , I said , " I 'm not going to Atlanta , am I ? " I did n't even know where I was going . I had no conception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think I knew anyone except Hank Aaron who even played for the Braves . I mean , I followed the Giants and I did n't play in the Dark Ages . This was ' 74 . <p> But now , my boys know everybody who plays for everybody . I guess players are just more aware now of what 's available to them . And that 's fine . The bottom is still the same . If you play well , you 'll do fine ; if you do n't play well , you do n't . It 's still a very honest situation . <p> Q : But look at what 's happened in the Braves clubhouse now , with the Otis Nixon-Deion Sanders situation ? Would this have been such a problem five or 10 years ago ? <p> A : Some of this stuff has been happening for a long time . It 's just now that players have more options . Did n't Koufax sit out ? The other thing is , there 's so much competition between you guys and ESPN . I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to know what Deion said , so I read the paper . . . . There 's a lot more going on , a lot more people know what 's going on , guys verbalize a lot more because they have a lot more options . They can leave an organization . Some clubs have renegotiated salaries , which is something that , once you do it , wow . That 's why I read the paper every morning . You used to get a box score and that was it . Now everyone wants to know everything . <p> Q : What are the odds of a guy leaving two teams and they both immediately take off and win championships ? <p> A : I do n't know , but if I 'm a free agent , I 'd sign with the Rockies next year . It 's kind of strange . <p> Q : You 've been pretty stoic about never getting a chance to play in the World Series , but does it still burn down deep ? <p> A : Sure . Sure , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun . We got close but we never did make it . Gosh , you see a lot of guys who have been in a lot of them and it must be an unbelievable feeling . What 's going on here is nothing like ' 82 either . <p> Q : Are you getting season tickets ? <p> A : I do n't know . You ca n't get ' em . There 's no more left . <p> Q : People have asked you about this forever , but what about Cooperstown ? When did it first occur to you you had a chance ? The two MVP seasons ? <p> A : I was so young and you do n't really think about it . But when I was getting close to 400 home runs , people started asking a lot . I 'd be lying to say I have n't thought about it . When you first start playing , you 're not thinking about something like that . And when you 're done playing and people start asking you about it , you do n't really know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and just to be asked a question about it . . . when it ever happens or not . . . just to be asked about it is something that 's hard for me to believe . <p> Q : You are n't exactly the type to gauge yourself , to try and project where you rank in history . <p> A : Well , no . There are different approaches for different personalities . I always felt it was good to keep things to a minimum as far as talking about what I might do . I really admire guys who can say these things and just spit it out . It 's something I 've never been able to do . It 's really just sticking up for yourself . I 've always admired guys who say what 's on their mind . I 've always kind of been guarded in a lot of ways . That 's just the way I am . I do n't like to say everything that 's going on up here . I never really did and I do n't feel comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being that exciting or in depth because there 's a lot of things you keep to yourself . <p> I think of Mike Schmidt . He said what was on his mind all the time . It kind of rubbed some people the wrong way sometimes , but I figure that 's the way he felt . I think if everybody was like that , we 'd all be better off . Maybe not . <p> Q : How close did you come to hitting a ball out of the park this season ? <p> A : I hit a ball in St. Louis that I think short-hopped the wall . It wound up a single . I hit a ball in the gap off Tom Glavine but it was n't that deep . I had plenty of opportunities . <p> Q : What time comes back to you , your favorite moments ? <p> A : No exact moments . Just ' 82 in general . Great group of guys . Had a great time together and being able to win the division . It was a crazy year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was great . It really was .
