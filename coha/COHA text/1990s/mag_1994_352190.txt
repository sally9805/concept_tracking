Blessed by his bloodlines , Edward Moore Kennedy should have been able to count on the adjective " incumbent " as a perpetual political heirloom . Even in this season of electoral discontent with the vagaries and pomposities of politics , his Kennedy and Fitzgerald legacy retains magic . In spite of scandal , the Senator still polls a " favorable " rating of 57% . But Kennedy is discovering that admiration no longer translates into support . <P> It seems a particularly vicious irony that Kennedy 's political opponent is the mirror image of the veteran Senator 's former self . Republican Mitt Romney is young , trim and drop-dead handsome . His life mocks Kennedy 's controversial past : the Republican is a teetotaler , a never-divorced family man and a self- made millionaire . That should be trouble enough on the campaign trail . But Kennedy faces a far stiffer obstacle : his constituents crave change simply for the sake of change . <P> In Massachusetts , the hunger is not fueled by the sweep-the-bum-out mentality that is rattling other incumbents . Rather , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Months before Romney gained his lock on the Republican candidacy , veteran G.O.P. pollster Richard Wirthlin came up with some surprising statistics : while 43% of voters favored Kennedy 's re-election , 50% did not . " His numbers are perfectly good , " says Boston Globe pollster Gerry Chervinsky , " but half the people think it 's time for a change . " And a poll released last week by the Globe shows that while 52% of voters think Kennedy is doing an excellent or above-average job , 49% believe it is time to give someone else a chance . The contest is a statistical dead heat , with Kennedy running 48% to Romney 's 46%  --  in a state where Republicans account for only 13% of registered voters . <P> Bay Staters hold Romney 's business experience in high regard : 52% believe it to be appropriate preparation for a job in the Senate , compared with just 39% three months ago . The son of former Michigan Governor and 1968 presidential candidate George Romney , young Romney made his millions during the ' 80s as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businesses have helped create 10,000 jobs , Kennedy 's activities only funnel in federal grants : that is , funds derived from taxes . " Ted has never had a job in 32 years , " Romney charges . " He has no idea how to create jobs , except with government money . " <P> To counter Romney 's image as a family man , Kennedy is campaigning with Victoria , 40 , his telegenic wife of two years . He is also fighting back with the first negative campaign of his political life . He is skeptical about Romney 's job-creation claims . He has noted that while Romney says he favors universal health-care coverage , none of the part-time employees at Staples , the successful office-supplies chain that Romney helped establish , receive such coverage from the company . ( Then again , part-timers usually do n't . ) Last week Kennedy even introduced religion into the race , demanding to know if Romney , a member of the Mormon Church , supported church policies that until 1978 excluded black men from serving as priests . Romney quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off questions about his Catholicism during his run for the presidency .
