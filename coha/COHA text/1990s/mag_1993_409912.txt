There are cultures on this planet that have no word for minute or hour ; where a moment can last a whole morning . We do n't live in one of them . Rather , we live in a culture where the efficient and productive use of time has become high art  --  a culture where , if you can balance three spinning plates on three thin sticks , you are rewarded with a fourth plate . Then a fifth . The belief that time is a resource that must be monitored closely and managed carefully is one of the basic laws of our time-crunched world , as is the imperative to do more and do it quicker . Is it any wonder our culture favors the young and energetic ? Who else can accomplish the hundreds of tasks each of us must master in a typical day , as well as process the thousand bits of information rushing at us every hour ? In my workshops at Omega and around the country on time shifting  --  learning how to toggle between hyperproductivity and an awareness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do you feel that you have enough time in your daily lives ? " Invariably , more than 90 percent declare an overwhelming sense of " time-poverty  --  part of an epidemic of anxiety and pressure in our society . Ironically , in response , methods to improve our management of time have gained in popularity along with new , speedier technology that helps us develop greater efficiency . Yet while these initially seem to help , they ultimately serve only to increase the speed of our lives . We learn to go faster and get more done  --  only to take on more work and responsibility . A curious thing happens as the pace of our lives grows faster and faster  --  our definition of a " moment " grows shorter and shorter , moving our awareness of time into ever-tinier increments . By cramming each moment so full of events , we leave ourselves no time to actually experience them in any meaningful way . As a result , the future arrives that much quicker , and it begins to predominate . The " now " becomes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we can get to that . We work for the weekend , rush through lunch to get back to our desks , worry about next month 's deadline before this month is completed . We divide our attention and awareness between the task at hand that we 're rushing to complete and the next item on our day-planner . " MIND TIME " VS . " EMOTIONAL TIME " As well as not living in the present , the vast majority of us spend our time not being present in our lives . Slowly , our perceptions of the world and our existence in it are being curtailed . We are so focused on what 's ahead that we just ca n't come alive in the here and now . Instead of shortening each moment of time , instead of breaking them down into progressively smaller units , we need to learn how to expand them , how to open ourselves more comfortably to our senses and bring attention into the present without having our mind race back and forth with other distracting thoughts . The pace of our lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which operate at different speeds . Thoughts , which are processed electrically , communicate faster than our hormonal and chemical emotions . The demands of the modern world have required us to function more quickly , so we use what I call " mind time " to mentally engage to our fullest in order to juggle up-coming events . There is no time to deal with or process our slower feelings  --  utilizing what I call " emotional time "  --  so we repress them or stuff them down . Despite this avoidance , however , our emotions do n't disappear , nor do they stay down for long . The moment we begin to slow down , they come flooding back in and we begin to feel again . Unfortunately , many people report that when they try to relax , what comes up are uncomfortable emotions  --  anxiety or anger over unresolved encounters , guilt over inactivity . So we get busy again , and repress once more those feelings that allow us to fully experience our lives . Confronting this reservoir of unprocessed emotion is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age . Growing older involves a lifetime shift in the way we perceive time as well as the way we use it . If our experience of slowing down is always pain or discomfort , no wonder we ca n't sit still , no wonder we busy ourselves and continue to feel in a rush to accomplish . LINEAR VS . CIRCULAR TIME Each of us is born into and raised in a particular " time world "  --  an environment with its own rhythm to which we entrain ourselves . Certain cultures have related to time as a circular phenomenon , in which there is no pressure or future anxiety . The whole of existence goes around : the cycle of the seasons , of planting and harvesting , the daily return of the sun , of birth and death . In circular time there is no pressing need to achieve and create newness , or to insatiably produce more than is needed to simply survive . Additionally , there is no fear of death . Such societies have successfully integrated the past and future into a peaceful sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who held the knowledge of the past  --  upon which the future was dearly linked . By contrast , linear time  --  which is concerned primarily with the future directly in front of us and unconnected with the past  --  ignores this wisdom , instead concerning itself with the factual and technical information needed to fulfill impending demands . Here , the process of aging is considered akin to becoming " has-beens , " past the age of productivity and without a clear role in a population of producers . In a fast-forward society such as ours , which may be seen as " info-bound " rather than " wisdom-bound , " those not capable of rushing forward are seen as disposable . GETTING OLDER Starting somewhere around our mid-twenties , our physical and mental capabilities begin to slow down somewhat . Of course , at the same time , the pace of life around us is ever-increasing . And the resulting gap is disorienting ; it creates anxiety , which only worsens our situation and pushes us to move faster . In addition , we tend to focus more on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , music , photographs , and even relationships take on new significance with each passing year , acting as remnants of a simpler time , a time when we did n't feel so rushed and unfulfilled . Yet if our past is empty  --  filled only with the work that we 've done and the status we 've achieved  --  it can be very disconcerting . The past , after all , is a reflection of how well we 've lived in the present , how much of life 's emotions and experiences we 've incorporated into who we are today . If , for instance , we 've lived in an empty manner  --  constantly looking to the future with anxiety and fear for all that needs to be accomplished ; repressing our emotions because there is n't enough time to experience them ; trying to speed our way through activities while simultaneously performing other tasks  --  then the past is , in effect , absent from our lives . We experience this loss as a draining of our residual , or reserve , capacity to experience life  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do n't actually notice the depletion until later . Then , when we need to have a well from which to draw , we discover that our memory banks are empty ; there are no experiences from which we can draw comfort and wisdom and a better sense of who we are as we age and continue to change . Likewise , there is a lack of emotions that might enhance our lives , because we had no time to experience them . We find at age 30 that our 20s have been wasted in pursuit of corporate success , for instance , or at age 40 that we 've missed out on our children 's upbringing or a significant portion of our marriage , and so on . So , if the past is nonexistent and the future equals anxiety , what is needed is to come into the present moment . Instead of rushing , take your time , let your rhythm slow down . You can rush later if you need to , but for now , simply perform the task that is in front of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We spend our lives waiting for the important events to take place , rushing through these " in-between " moments . Yet the reality is that these interims actually make up a significant portion of our lives . Allowing ourselves to be present in them and experience them fully is what makes us alive  --  and helps to keep us young . This involves developing a sense of mindfulness , a way of being that puts you fully in the moment without pressure or anxiety about staying on schedule . It is a quality that each of us needs to learn how to cultivate more in our lives , awakening all of our senses and being comfortable in the present  --  to feel rooted , with nowhere to go and no need to rush , without feeling bored or anxious . We 're aging , but that 's okay . Our senses do n't work as well as they used to , but that 's okay , too . FREEDOM IN TIME Some will read this and wonder why they should slow down . Is n't it okay to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it , in fact , necessary to do so ? There really is no right or wrong answer ; rather it is a question of how we feel about our lives . My experience has taught me that there is too much stress caused by the frantic pace at which most of us exist . The result is a disconnection from the world around us and our sense of being alive in it . People report feeling trapped , powerless to effect any meaningful change , coping as best as they can yet knowing they do n't feel the way they would like to feel . The key is to step back from the edge , learn to get involved in the process rather than constantly longing for the end result . This does not mean giving up our goal-oriented lives  --  simply modifying them , finding a balance between our productive and our emotional selves . This enables us to lives as whole beings , fully alive . In response to the pace of our modern world , learning how to successfully shift time can be one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to age . " TIME-SHIFTING EXERCISES " Since all of us feel pressure , we forget that time can be changed and shifted . In response to the pace of our modern world , learning how to shift time can achieve both health and longevity as we age . In my workshops , I recommend five exercises : * COME INTO THE MOMENT . This entails nothing more extraordinary than finding a balance between hyperproductive time and nonproductive time  --  without thinking of the latter as inefficient , lazy , and boring . Think of it as a cigarette break  --  only without the cigarette . Several times a day you should let yourself relax and become fully aware of the present moment by focusing on something simple , such as your breath . Let your senses take in as much as they can and allow your emotions to rise into consciousness . * SET ASIDE " BOUNDARY TIME . " Pick a part of each day and allow nothing to intrude upon it . Do n't answer the phone or turn on the radio . Try something slow and meditative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BE SPONTANEOUS . Make no plans for an entire day . Just go off and have an adventure . Court serendipity . Explore new territory  --  without any schedule . * CREATE " TIME RETREATS . " These are longer time shifts that affect your normal rhythm . Vacations are a perfect arena ( " island-time , " a general slowing down , is often experienced by visitors to the Caribbean ) , provided you do n't spend them as a busy tourist . * DO SOMETHING YOU LOVE . Strong emotions bring you into the present better than anything . A moment can last a whole morning when you 're doing something you love . Most of us do n't because it often leads to guilt . " TIME-SHIFT RITUALS " Slowing down is a good way to appreciate the present moment . I suggest developing rituals : * DRIVE 10 MPH SLOWER . Many of us drive fast , even when we 're not in a rush . Try a new route or simply notice the old one more . * TAKE A MOMENT BEFORE EATING . Saying grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of wolfing it down . * SPEND FIVE MINUTES IN YOUR DRIVEWAY BEFORE ENTERING YOUR HOUSE . Sit in your car and listen to music , take deep breaths  --  anything to allow a shift from work life to home life . * SHOWER AFTER WORK . Just for a minute or two , to " wash away " the day 's work and allow you to leave it behind for the evening . * WAIT A FEW RINGS BEFORE ANSWERING THE PHONE . Many people rush to pick it up immediately , prolonging their hectic moods . * HONOR THE PROCESS ITSELF . Many of us practice our own rituals naturally , in our hobbies , etc . Whatever the task or activity , slow down , do just one thing , do it well , and allow yourself the sense of accomplishment without feeling the need to get it done and move on . <p>
