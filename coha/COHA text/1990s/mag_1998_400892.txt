Let me tell you what I know as a 40-year-old woman with MS who became menopausal at 38 . ( Menopause seems to start on the early side in my family . ) First I worried about hot flashes . After all , I had been told not to get overheated no hot tubs or steaming showers , no baking in the sun . Now my body was overheating on its own . No problem , said my neurologist , and for me , the advice was right . The flushes of intense heat that would sometimes raise a light sweat on my brow passed quickly with only an occasional chill afterwards . Since these sensations were not the numbness and buzzing heaviness I feel with MS , I almost enjoyed them . I certainly did n't fear them . What did bother me was that they woke me early in the morning and in the evening when I was trying to rest . Less sleep and less rest did effect my fatigue levels . A lot of the symptoms of menopause are not as recognizable as hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are the vague ones : headaches , PMS symptoms , insomnia , aches , palpitations , tiredness , forgetfulness , and eye problems . Since we already have a chronic illness filled with vague symptoms , it can be difficult to separate out the menopausal ones . Like every woman in the country , I 've been bombarded with news stories on HRT ( hormone replacement therapy ) . Foolishly I thought my decision was a simple one . Do I take hormones or not ? HRT relieves hot flashes and reduces the risk of heart disease and osteoporosis . HRT may also help with hormonerelated memory problems and even Alzheimer 's disease . But finding the correct dosage and method or combination of methods is often difficult , as I learned from my own and my friends ' experiences . And then there are side effects . I suffered nausea and PMS symptoms , which made me feel lousy . I lost my motivation to do some of the things that were keeping me strong and giving me more energy like eating healthy foods and exercising regularly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too many problems with HRT to continue with it . There are other contraindications for HRT , too , such as having a history of uterine or breast cancer , liver disease , blood clots in the veins or lungs , migraine headaches , large uterine fibroids , endometriosis , severe varicose veins , or abnormal vaginal bleeding . HRT also seems to somewhat increase the risk for uterine and breast cancers . As you can see , you need to work closely with your gynecologist and present your complete medical history . Without the HRT I worried about my risk for heart disease and osteoporosis . But when I weighed my other risk factors for these diseases , I discovered I was not at high risk . If I had been a wheelchair user , my bones might be weaker and I would be at risk for osteoporosis . If I had a history of chronic depression , I would have been concerned , since recent studies have found a link between depression and loss of bone density . Luckily I 've only occasionally fallen under the spell of MS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without HRT . Is hormone therapy a good long-term answer for any woman ? Who knows ? Presently women are continuing with HRT not knowing when or if they will need to stop . So far , only 8 to 12% continue HRT after 2 years . A 12-year study of HRT by the Women 's Health Initiative is part of a larger 15-year clinical study of women 's health sponsored by the National Institutes of Health and the National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute . Results from a longterm study by the Women 's International Study of Long Duration Oestrogen after Menopause , known as WISDOM , which is being coordinated by the London-based Medical Research Council , are expected in 2012 . These are much-needed studies , but there is n't any research yet on women with MS going through menopause . So what should we do ? Talk to a doctor you trust , of course . Assess your risk factors for heart disease : Are you obese ? A smoker ? Do you have a family history of heart disease ? As for osteoporosis : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An inactive lifestyle ? Are you very thin ? You need to consider your MS in the mix . If I had balance problems along with risk factors for osteoporosis , I might have stayed with HRT . When I became menopausal , I was unprepared and ignorant about it . I researched the topic for myself . My research revealed that there were not a lot of answers for me . But by taking what information was available and assessing my own situation , I was able to make decisions concerning my health . For now , that 's the best any of us can do . Author Affiliation <p>                     @x Of all the rooms in all the field houses in all the parks in Seattle , he had to walk into this one ? <p> What the hell is he doing here ? <p> Poppy did her best to continue her conversation with the manager of the Ace hardware store . But the man had a tendency to drone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrival striding through the milling crowd of business owners as if he owned the joint , it was difficult to focus her attention . Her gaze kept wanting to follow his progress . That was de Sanges , right ? <p> She just barely swallowed the self-derisive snort that tickled the back of her throat . Because , please . This might be the last place she expected to see him , but of course it was . <p> Considering their one and only encounter , however , she did n't feel a burning need to beat herself up for allowing her mind to shy away from the admission . <p> Still , the truth was , it had taken no more than a glimpse to recognize the tall , lean , muscular body she 'd seen only once before . She 'd documented the prominent bony nose , those sharp cheekbones and that **25;502;TOOLONG hair . Was familiar with those long , white-nailed fingers and the dark olive skin that she had a feeling owed more to genetics than exposure to the sun . <p> And <p> Oh <p> My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Which she 'd watched go hot for a few insane minutes last fall as they 'd stood toe-to-toe in Miss A. 's parlor . <p> Whoa . She firmly corralled her wayward thoughts . Do n't even go there , girl . Okay , so it was Detective Sheik , as Janie insisted on calling him . Big deal . But her face went hot and her mouth went dry , and she had to fight like hell not to squirm at the memory of Ava saying that for a minute there she 'd feared Poppy and de Sanges  --  a man none of them had even met until that afternoon  --  might start going at it hot and heavy in the middle of the parlor . <p> Because her friend had been right . Poppy had never experienced anything quite so visceral as what she 'd felt that day with the tall , dark cop . <p> " Everyone seems to be here , " Garret Johnson , the president of the Merchants ' Association , said over the babble of conversation in the Park Department 's field house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get this meeting under way . " <p> Eking out a breath of relief at having the plug yanked on that particular memory , she watched de Sanges from the corner of her eye until he pulled out a chair at the rectangular table . Then she took a seat at the opposite end . <p> It would have been even better if she could 've nabbed one on the same side . That way she would n't be able to see him at all without making a concerted effort . But Penny , the owner of Slice of Heaven Pies , beat her to the last chair on de Sanges 's side . Oh , well  --  too bad , so sad for her . Taking a seat across from the other woman , she exchanged idle chitchat for a few moments until the president rapped his knuckles on the wooden tabletop to call the meeting to order . <p> " Okay , as everyone knows , " he said the instant the last holdout conversation fizzled into silence , " we 're here today to decide what to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But before we get into that , I 'd like to introduce everyone to Detective Jason de Sanges from the Seattle Police Department . He 's on the mayor 's special task force to reduce burglaries and has kindly agreed to sit on our panel . Detective . " He turned toward the cop and Poppy automatically turned in her seat to look at de Sanges as well . " Allow me to introduce you to our motley crew . " <p> He went around the table performing introductions and , when he came to her , said , " This is Poppy Callo-way . She 's not actually a merchant , but she 's on so many of our ' boards ' that we consider her an honorary member of the association . " <p> It was a standing joke , since she designed the menu and Today 's Specials black or white boards for several of the business owners here today . <p> De Sanges nodded and looked at her for a suspended instant with those dark , uncompromising eyes . " Ms. Calloway and I have met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she could almost taste the rampant curiosity and speculation . " Do n't look at me as if I were a suspect in one of his cases , " she said dryly . " You all heard about the theft we had at the Wolcott mansion a few months ago . Detective de Sanges came out to take a report when we were dissatisfied with the response we got from the first officer on the scene . " <p> De Sanges had been dissatisfied as well  --  that Ava had used one of her many contacts to have him brought in . So he had n't been there voluntarily , and he and Poppy had definitely gotten off on the wrong foot when she 'd taken exception to what she 'd perceived as his lack of concern over a break-in at the mansion that she , Jane and Ava had only recently inherited from Miss Agnes 's estate . Well , could you blame her ? He had all but said he 'd been yanked off a real job in order to look for their silver spoons . <p> Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ava had been born to money . Poppy and Jane came from working-class neighborhoods . They 'd all met in the fourth grade at Country Day school  --  Janie attending on a scholarship and her own tuition paid by Grandma Ingles , who was herself an alumni . Even today  --  despite inheriting an estate that was short on cash but long on priceless collectibles and valuable real estate  --  Ava was the only one of them who had any discretionary income . Jane was still inventorying Miss A. 's collections and the mansion was a long way and a small fortune from being saleable , which was their ultimate goal . <p> Still , in the wake of Jane 's run-in with the thief , they 'd learned de Sanges had n't just blown them off but had interviewed Jane 's coworkers at the Metropolitan Museum  --  had in fact spent the most time talking to Gordon Ives . And since Gordon had eventually been arrested for the crime , Poppy thought she could probably cut the detective some slack and agree he had done his job after all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion , " Garret said . " I know everyone here was disturbed about how young our graffiti ' artists ' were and you no doubt want to thrash out whether or not to press charges against them . Anyone whose business was tagged is , of course , free to do so at any time  --  this is n't a case of majority rules . But we 're here to entertain all reasonable suggestions , both pro and con . So let 's get some dialogue going , people . " <p> No one said anything for a long , silent moment , then Jerry Harvey , whose H &amp; A on the Ave on the corner had taken the biggest brunt of the vandalism , said , " I 'd like to know who 's going to clean up the side of my shop . " He 'd been the first to spot one of the kids tagging the cafT across from him when he 'd gone to lock the front door of his funky home-decorations and art-framing shop for the night . <p> A few of the merchants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges . <p> Poppy took a breath and quietly released it . " I have a suggestion , " she said . " I know I do n't have the same stake in the outcome of today 's meeting as the rest of you . But I was at the Hardwire when Jerry caught the kids , and frankly I was disturbed by how young they are . The officer who came in response to your call , Jerry , said this is their first brush with the law . Rather than see them thrown into the system I 'd like to offer an alternate solution that directly relates to your question . " <p> All the merchants involved in Friday night 's excitement gave her their undivided attention . De Sanges 's eyes narrowed . <p> " I think it might benefit all of the businesses to give the kids something to keep them busy , " she said . " To provide them with an artistic outlet that I believe we 'd find more palatable than tagging  --  which I freely admit I do n't get . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their actions . " <p> " How ? " Garret asked . <p> " First by having them clean up the tagging with a fresh coat of paint that they either have to provide themselves or work off by sweeping or handling other odd jobs for the businesses they defaced . " <p> " I like that so far , " Penny said thoughtfully . " Except Marlene 's place is brick , so how does that benefit her ? " <p> " There are gels and pastes that dissolve paint from brick , and the same rules would apply  --  they 'd supply whatever 's needed . " <p> Almost everyone nodded  --  including Jerry . But he also pinned her with a suspicious look . " So where does the ' artistic outlet ' part come in ? " <p> Poppy knew this was where things could go south . But it was n't for nothing she 'd grown up with parents who got involved in causes on a near-daily basis . Not to mention the way her idea tied in to her own personal passion : bringing art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave Jerry her best trust-me smile , then quietly exhaled . " I propose we keep them off the streets by letting them paint a mural on the south side of your building . " <p> Oh , for cri'sake . Jase leaned back in his chair and examined the woman he had privately labeled the Babe . Which , okay , was n't exactly a hardship since the whole package  --  that lithe body , exotic brown eyes and cloud of curly Nordic-pale hair  --  was very examinable . <p> He knew from experience , however , that she was a pain in the ass . And did n't it just figure ? She was a damn bleeding-heart liberal to boot . <p> Earlier , when he 'd walked in and seen her chatting up one of the guys in this group of small-business owners , you could have knocked him off his feet with a blade of grass . He had n't understood why she was here , since as far as he knew she was n't a merchant herself . Hey , as far as he could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since he had firmly resisted the urge to run a check on her after their previous run-in , he could be wrong about that . <p> In any case , the president of the Merchants'Association had explained it when he 'd said that Calloway was a board member . <p> Well , of course she was . He should have figured that out for himself after meeting her and her two rich-girl buddies last fall , when they 'd used their connections with the mayor to have him yanked off a job where an old lady had been hospitalized by a mugger in order to look for their missing tea towels . <p> Okay , so it had turned out to be more than that  --  a lot more . But contrary to the Babe 's accusation that he could n't be bothered to do his job , he had been following the exact letter of the law when he 'd told her there was n't much he could do for them . But he 'd nevertheless been digging into Gordon Ives 's background when he got the call that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break-in at the Wolcott mansion  --  this one involving a threat against Jane Kaplinski 's life . <p> All of which had squat to do with today 's situation . He listened for a moment as Calloway outlined her harebrained scheme . He kept waiting for someone to shoot it down , but when he instead saw several of the merchants nodding their heads , he could n't take it any longer . " You 're kidding me , right ? " <p> Slowly , she turned her head to look at him . " Excuse me ? " <p> " I figure this has to be a joke , because you ca n't possibly be serious . They broke the law . You want to reward them for that ? " <p> Her eyes flashed fire , giving him an abrupt flash of his own  --  of dTja vu . Because he was no stranger to that phenomenon  --  her eyes had done the exact same thing when she 'd leaned over him in the chair where he 'd sat in the mansion parlor , taking their report last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he was damned if he planned to fall prey to that again . <p> Maybe she was thinking along the same lines , because she did n't climb over the table to get in his face the way she had last time . Instead , she said coolly , " No , Detective , I am not kidding . I 'm pretty darn serious , in fact . These are n't hardened criminals we 're talking about  --  they 're children , the oldest barely seventeen . " <p> " Yeah , they start ' em young these days , " he agreed . <p> " It 's not as if they committed a violent crime  --  they did n't mug an old lady or attempt to rob someone at gunpoint at the ATM machine . " Her eyes narrowed . " Or commit a burglary of any kind , " she said with slow thoughtfulness , and he could almost smell the circuits burning as she followed that thought to its logical conclusion . <p> " They did n't commit a burglary , " she repeated , gazing around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him dead in the eye . " So why are you sitting on this panel , again ? " <p> Excellent question . When Greer had offered to put his name in for the mayor 's task force he 'd given his lieutenant an immediate and firm " Thanks , but no thanks . " Then , like an idiot , he 'd let Murphy  --  the old cop who had stepped in years ago to take him in hand before the de Sanges genes could screw him up entirely  --  talk him into changing his mind . Murph had insisted that if Jase wanted to wear those lieutenant bars himself someday  --  which he did  --  he needed to start making his name known to the powers that be . And a good way to do that was to be part of these task forces  --  even if this particular one was more about election-year public relations than the war on crime . <p> So here he sat , proving once again that no good deed goes unpunished . <p> Not letting his thoughts show , however , he merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own , evincing none of his reluctance to be part of this dog-and-pony show . " Because this is how we so often see it begin . Baby street punks grow up to be full-fledged street punks . Today it 's tagging or stealing some other kid 's lunch money at school  --  if they even bother to show up at school , that is . " <p> " So perhaps we should make that a condition of my proposal . No school , no participation in the art project . " <p> Slick , he thought with unwilling admiration , but said as if she had n't spoken , " Tomorrow it 's mugging some little old lady in the parking lot at Northgate . " Pulling his gaze away from the Babe 's , he included the entire table of merchants in his regard . " Or right here in your own community . " <br> Continues ...
