British-bom Hugh Cook has published twelve novels , mostly fantasy , including The Shift , The Questing Hero , and Lords of the Sword . He took time out from writing to complete a B.A. degree at the University of Auckland with a doublemajor in English and Japanese , and now he puts those degrees to use teaching English in Tokyo . At the moment , he 's working on a new novel , entitled Business as Usual , but he set aside the book to provide us with this jaunt through time to a very strange place . <p> THE REELING FLICKER OF days slowed , steadied , froze . A quick look around . The time machine was sitting on grass . Beyond the grass : buildings . It was , recognizably , Central Park . Manhattan . With a huge sigh of relief - so far , no nuclear war - Jack Fabrax dismounted , clambering down onto the grass , lugging the heavy suitcase after him . God , what a weight ! The time machine flickered and dissolved . It would return in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sending the time machine back to 1962 . Conceivably , Kevin Culdaneath would work out what had happened . Conceivably , Kevin would climb aboard the time machine and chase Jack into the year 2003 . But . But Jack wanted to have the option of going back to 1962 . In case things did n't work out as expected in this brave new world , the world of the Third Millennium . Jack was sweating profusely by the time he had manhandled the suitcase to the street . He stood there , watching for a taxi . But did they still have taxis in the Third Millennium ? And would his greenbacks be valid currency ? He had more than half expected shiny flying machines , the U.S. dollar replaced by the credit or some such thing , and the people to be walking round in fancy aerodynamic robes , or nothing at all . But , outwardly at least , everything looked amazingly normal . The automobiles were styled differently , but were conceptually similar . And people still wore pants , shirts , shoes . Jack himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt , a conservative tie , and nobody looked at him twice . A guy in a suit just like his walked by , talking to someone using a two-way radio , a dandy little gadget small enough to fit easily into the palm of your hand . " Taxi ! " Jack had it all figured out . He would get the taxi to drive him round town . He would chat with the cabby and find out the latest . The cab driver was a Negro . A really black Negro . Totally black- an amazing blackness which seemed to shimmer into blue . A woman . She had weird scars on her face , patterned scars like a sergeant 's chevrons . Someone cut her ? Then why did n't she have plastic surgery ? " Empire State Building , " said jack . " What ? " " Empire State ! The building ! " No dice . The Negress asked a couple of questions , but her English was barely intelligible . She had to be drunk . Angrily , Jack got out of the cab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . How could anyone possibly not know the Empire State Building ? Could it have been demolished ? Torn down ? Lost to memory ? No , impossible . Three taxis later , Jack finally found a driver who spoke English . Sort of . The cabby was from Afghanistan , wherever the hell that was , and took him along approximately familiar streets - the city 's basic layout was still the same-to the Empire State Building . Outside the building , there were soldiers in strange blotched uniforms who carried weapons which looked strangely light , like children 's toys . Despite having figured out that inflation would brutalize his meager cash reserves , Jack was shocked by the cab fare . He bought a paper , a copy of the New York Times , meaning to check first the date , second the news , and third the stock market prices . He really wanted to know - and know fast - just what his stock certificates were worth . The date ? Thursday 6 November 2003 . The right date , then . The stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the odds , the world had survived the threat of nuclear war - so far - and the stock market was still in operation . However , Jack could find no listings for his stocks . Okay then , maybe the companies had changed their names . No problem . Work on that later . How about the news ? Well , that was problematical . Sport was sport , that much was the same . Sport was still sport , food was still food , fashion was still fashion and crime was still crime . But . Apart from that , the news was unintelligibly weird , full of people and places and words and countries he had never heard of . Al Gore , Newt Gingrich , Nelson Mandela , Jason Race , Argan Vlastavich , Michael Jackson , Madonna and the Artist Formerly Known As Prince - who were these people ? And if there was some guy " formerly known " as Prince , why the hell not say who he was now ? And what was HIV ? And the Internet ? And cyberspace ? Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some kind of plague . But - Bangladesh ? A place , evidently . A city ? A country ? And how about this ? African American . What 's that ? Okay . The woman in the taxi . Straight out of Africa - that would explain that total skin . An American straight out of Africa , an African American . Then he found an article he did understand . About Germany . Nazis in Germany had demonstrated in Berlin , had fought with the police , had desecrated Jewish graves . Reading this , he went cold . The hairs stood up on the back of his neck . Germany ! Not East Germany or West Germany but just straight Germany . In that moment of shock , a glimmering of understanding came to him . He had not arrived in the future at all . Instead , he had been precipitated into an alternate universe . In this alternate universe , there had been no Hitler , no Holocaust , and Germany had not been divided into two separate countries . In this alternate universe , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present . Not the future , but an alternate universe . That was his thesis , and a second article confirmed it . A dry , boring article about an economic agreement between Russia , Ukraine , and Belorussia which was being negotiated in St. Petersburg . Evidently , in this alternate universe the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics did not exist . There had never been a Lenin , so St. Petersburg had not become Leningrad . Presumably , there had never been a Second World War , either . And , in this alternate universe , his stock certificates were probably useless . The companies - no listings for them on the stock exchange ! probably did not even exist . That meant he had no resources but the metal in the suitcase . The realization came as an appalling shock . He had figured it out so nicely . A little jump into the future , just forty-one years , enough time for his enemies to die and for his stocks to fatten up but not enough time for civilization to change out of recognition . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarette , " said Jack . He pulled out a cigarette and lit up . Then , feeling hungry , he walked into an eatery , lugging his suitcase with him . As he walked into the eatery , all conversation stopped . People looked at him , and stared . Immediately , Jack realized something was wrong . Hideously wrong . He had made some dreadful mistake . He glanced down at his fly , half-convinced everything down there was hanging out in public . But , no , it was all in order . He was a respectable guy in a suit . His first impulse was to run . But - no ! This was America , damn it . He was an American citizen , a citizen of the Free World , and there was no way he was going to be run off by a bunch of people staring at him . Besides , if something was wrong , he had to find out what . So Jack walked up to the counter . Cleared his throat . " Hamburger , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Black . " The guy behind the counter turned to his colleague . The two spoke together briefly in a language which was , unmistakably , Russian . Russian ! What the hell were a couple of Russians doing serving food here in New York ? " You want ketchup on the burger ? " " Yeah . " Jack paid for his food , took it to a table , went back for the suitcase , then sat down to eat . As he did so , a woman got to her feet . She walked toward him . A very beautiful blonde , immaculately coifed . As she approached , he smelled her perfume . Her eyes were an icy blue . She was an angelic vision of Nordic perfection . Only one thing was wrong . She was not smiling . " Hi , " said Jack , speaking without bothering to remove the cigarette from his lips . Without a word , the woman reached out . She plucked the cigarette from his lips . Then stubbed it out on his hamburger . " Hey ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her by the wrist . In response , with her free hand she sprayed him with something from a little aerosol can . He breathed red flame , and his world dissolved into a reeling whirl of agony . It was like when he had dived into that pool , back when he was a kid , and there had been too much chlorine in the water . The same watering pain in his eyes , only worse . Slowly  --  choking , gasping , lungs heaving - Jack began to recover . Then one of the countermen approached him . " Mister , " said the counterman , in heavy Russian-accented English . " You better get out . If you come back , I 'll call the cops . " " Sure , " said Jack , grabbing his suitcase . " Sure . Sure . I 'm going . " Out on the street , he put down the suitcase and mopped his sweating brow . This was crazy ! Something had gone dreadfully wrong back therebut what ? He reviewed his own behavior . All utterly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nobody was taking any notice of him , but for a couple of panhandlers - a hell of a lot of beggars on the street , now he thought about it . His clothing , though it came from 1962 , was not significantly different from what conservative business types were wearing here in 2003 . Jack took a good look at those people . A hell of a lot of Asians on the street  --  tourists ? Or what ? And a lot of Mexican types , too , some speaking Spanish as they went by . Also : a muttering lunatic , a patently deranged man in rags who was talking to himself pretty loudly , gesticulating as he did so . Nobody called the cops to have the guy taken back to the nuthouse . Instead , everyone ignored the mad muttering lunatic , as if a dementing lunatic standing on the sidewalk in broad daylight in the middle of New York was the most natural thing in the world . Some weird sights , then . But . There were still guys who looked just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow , the locals had picked him as abnormal , aberrant in a truly intolerable way . Why ? The only thing he could think of ... maybe they thought he was queer . Yeah . That was possible . Maybe , in this brave new world , only sexually abnormal people wore business suits . That thought made Jack truly uncomfortable . He wished there was someone he could ask , someone who could explain it all to him . But - time enough to figure it out later . Right now : business . Money was a priority . The suitcase was full of gold , and now it was time to start changing that gold to cash . Then he could start looking for information . And , if necessary , for a new set of clothes . Inside of half an hour-phone , phone book , taxi-Jack found his way to a pawn shop . Showed just one gold wedding ring . " You got some ID ? " A routine question . Low key , bored . But it riveted him . Shocked him rigid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in the car ... " And he backed out . Still reeling . Identity - he 'd never even thought of the problem . Why not ? Because it was totally insoluble . Outside , a guy was hanging around , muttering stuff to passersby . Strange stuff . " You want jash , amies , soft ? You want jubes , man ? " Desperate enough to chance anything , Jack moved closer . He wanted to kind of inconspicuously drift closer , but that was impossible because of the weight of the suitcase . It was killing him . He was one red mass of flushed sweat . " What you want , man ? " " What 've you got ? " said Jack , cautiously . " Anything , man . " " How about a gun ? " said Jack , too nervous to ask for what he really wanted . " Sure , man . Get you a Glock , get you anything . " A Glock ? Might be anything . A Third Millennium ray gun . A death ray super-blaster . Annihilate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The alien name carried with it the authentic thrill of the new . But , no , he did n't really want a gun , not right now . " Come on , man . What you want ? " " ID , " said Jack , unable to conceal his nervousness . " Five hundred bucks . Get you a green card , driver 's license , social security number . " " Five hundred ! " he said . His shock was genuine , unconcealable . Five hundred would clean him out . Hard on the heels of shock came anger . " Five hundred ! You got ta be kidding ! " " Okay , okay ! Chill , man , chill ! " They settled on $250 . Maybe too high - Jack got the impression he was getting the wrong end of the bargain . And he did not like , no , not one little bit , the visit to the grimy back room where they took his photo and produced the documents . But . He got out alive . Complete with ID . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least for the pawnbroker . Five pawn shops later- slow and cautious does it - Jack was feeling better . All going to plan . He had done it . He had worked his big swindle back in 1962 and he had got away clean , escaping in the mad professor 's time machine . Okay , so maybe his stock certificates were useless-if the newspaper stock market listings could be trusted , the tobacco companies in which he had so astutely invested simply did not exist in this alternate universe . But gold was still gold , money was still money , money could evidently buy anything , and he was going to be rich enough to start over . Only problem now - he was right out of cigarettes . But , okay , there was a barber shop just across the road . Jack crossed the street , went inside . Looked for the cigarettes . And saw them , okay . Gray pasteboard packets with no brand names . Just the bare unadorned label CIGARETTES in black and a message in red saying THESE THINGS KILL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gesturing . " See your paper ? " " What ? " " You know . Your paper . " " No , " said Jack . " I do n't understand . I just want some cigarettes , okay ? " " Okay , you want the cigarettes , I need to see your paper . " " My what ? " " Your paper , man ! Your prescription ! " " Prescription ? " said Jack , bewildered . " You are a registered addict , right ? Right ? Hey , you - I 'm talking to you ! You an addict , or what ? You a cop ? " " No , " said Jack . " I 'm not a cop . " " Then get outta here . You do n't get out , I 'm calling the cops , right now . " Back on the sidewalk , Jack started to figure it out . In this alternate universe , smoking was quasi-illegal . Or was it ? He wavered between belief and disbelief . Maybe it was , maybe it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular barber shop , that particular guy . " Face facts , " said Jack . " You just do n't know . " Okay , then . It was time to do some serious research . Go to the library - that was it . In this alternate universe , the Empire State Building was in the same place , so the library should be in the same place too . Only - it was n't . Well . The steps were there . And the lions . But the rest of it was a bomb crater , roped off with yellow plastic tape . Jack stood there staring , stunned . " What you looking at ? " Realizing his mouth was open , Jack closed it . Blinked . Focused on the stranger who had addressed him . A girl . Well , sort of . Pretty weird-looking girl . A blonde with a bunch of rings in her nose and a ring through her eyebrow and a semi-pornographic tattoo of a big-breasted mermaid writhing up the side of her neck . " Hi , " said Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hi . " Then she laughed , as if he had said something outrageously funny , and stuck out her tongue at him . With shock , Jack saw there was cold white metal riveted right through her tongue . Sick , sick , sick ! Really psycho stuff ! A pretty girl , and she had stuck something right through her tongue . Then something clicked . Suddenly , Jack understood . The dementing lunatic he had seen talking  --  almost shouting - on the street . The incomprehensible , disoriented cab drivers , who scarcely seemed to know Broadway from Fifth Avenue . The insane Nordic woman with the staring blue eyes who had stubbed out his cigarette on his hamburger . The guy at the barber shop who - bizarrely - had demanded a prescription when he asked to buy cigarettes . It all made sense . All the data hung together . Given one simple insight - given one simple thesis - Jack was suddenly able to organize a thousand different pieces of data into one simple , internally consistent picture . Now he had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into one big lunatic asylum . Obviously . " Ah , " said Jack . Ah . Eureka . I have it . Now I understand ! That was why nobody had called the cops to take away the dementing lunatic . The guy did not have to be taken to the asylum because he was already in the asylum , together with the madwoman with the staring eyes who had tried to gas Jack with her Third Millennium aerosol weapon - his eyes were still sore and smarting - and this psycho kid with the mutilated tongue . That , doubtlessly , explained why armed soldiers were guarding the Empire State Building . The building was , presumably , the administrative headquarters of the lunatic asylum - a place to which the inmates were forbidden access . " Want some cancer ? " said the girl . " Some what ? " said Jack . " You smoke . " " I do ? " " Your hands . Your teeth . " Jack 's fingers were , in a way which was not uncommon in 1962 , stained with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " said Jack . " Twenty bucks . One packet . " Even allowing for inflation , that was an incredible price . But Jack was down to his last cigarette . " Deal , " he said , producing a twenty . In response , the girl dipped her hand into her crotch Her crotch ! Jack reeled . She was wearing a man 's jeans . Yes . He was not hallucinating it . A man 's jeans , with the zip going right up the front , following the line of her , her The twenty was gone , snatched away , and the cigarettes were in Jack 's hand . He dropped them . He felt sick . A pretty girl , and she was dressed in this sick , totally obscene lesbian fashion . And Jack had a clear contrasting vision of his lost sweetheart , the adorable Amy Zebrolooda , whose pants had little zips on the side , little zips which , consonant with feminine modesty , made no obvious reference to her , her " You do n't want them ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack stepped on them , keeping them safe . Despite their provenance , he was going to keep them . He needed his nicotine . " Okay then , " said the girl . And she was gone , retreating down the street . After fifty yards , she turned , and made a rude sign . Yes . More evidence . He was trapped in a lunatic asylum , that was for sure . " Spare me one ? " A man 's voice . Who ? Turning , Jack saw a bearded man who looked as if he was dressed for a hunting trip . " Sure , " said Jack , relieved by the normality of the encounter , the normality of someone trying to bum a cigarette off him . Jack opened the packet and the stranger took a cigarette . Jack lit it for him with his gold lighter . " You 're a brave man , " said the bearded guy . " It 's a free country , " said Jack . " Is it ? " " Well , " said Jack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the bearded guy . " You hunt ? " said Jack . " Sure thing , " said the bearded guy . " Me too , " said Jack , establishing common social ground , disowning his charcoal gray suit . " Sarnac Lakes , ever heard of them ? " " Sure , " said the bearded guy . " Up near Mt . Marcy . " Jack got the impression that he had bridged the sartorial gap which separated them . They had established common ground . They were both hunters , woodsmen , smokers of tobacco . " So , " said Jack , gesturing at the bombed-out ruins of the library , " when did this happen ? " " Where you from ? " said the bearded man . " Me ? " said Jack . He wavered , poised on the edge of fiction . Then decided to risk the truth . He needed to find out what was going on in this alternate universe . And fast . " I 'm ... I 'm from the past . Kind of . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That so ? " " Yeah . I , uh ... came in a time machine . " " Aliens help you ? " " Aliens ? " said Jack , startled . " No . There was this guy , Angus Void . Mad professor type . He built this , this ... time machine . " " You sure you not with the aliens ? " " I 'm sure . " The bearded man looked around , as if checking for hidden observers . " Name 's Vance , " he said . " I 'm with the militia . " " The militia ? " said Jack . " Not here , " said Vance . " You come with me . " They ended up in a place in Brooklyn , where the streets were full of people speaking Russian . Vance explained the site had been carefully chosen- " Last place anyone would look for us . " Once they were safe in the hideout , up above a karaoke bar whatever karaoke was ) , Jack told his story . Jack expected resistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted the entire story without a single objection , as if time travelers from the past were no big surprise . Vance seemed to have - how to put it ? -a special capacity for belief . A special capacity to filter information and , automatically , to know what was true and what was not . With relief - just to confess was a relief , and to confess and be believed was a double relief - Jack told everything . How he fell in love with Amy Zebrolooda , the mad professor 's beautiful female assistant . How he lost Amy to Kevin Culdaneath , his slick and very rich rival . How he took revenge by conning Kevin , swindling him out of millions . The bulk of the money went into tobacco stocks , and some he converted to gold . Then he stole the professor 's time machine and fled into the future . " Or so I thought , " said Jack . " But something 's out of whack . This place is strange beyond comprehension , I need someone to explain , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Okay then , " said Vance . " You 've come to the right guy . " Then Vance explained . In this universe , America was ruled by a totalitarian federal government which had a lock grip on newspapers and television . The government had been infiltrated by space aliens , and was using a much-dreaded fleet of black helicopters to organize mass abductions of unsuspecting citizens . Once the aliens got hold of the citizens , they were subjected to unspeakable medical practices , including torture and brainwashing . The aliens " long-term strategy was to use the resources of the federal government to break the will of the people to resist , and to take away their weapons-assault rifles , machine guns , flame throwers , shoulder-launched rockets , all confiscated , in outright defiance of the Constitution . Once America 's strength had been broken by a combination of brainwashing and disarmament , the alien invasion fleet currently waiting out in the Oort Cloud would land openly , and the conquest would proceed . At first , Jack found this stuff hard to believe . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal guy from 1962 , it was wacky . No other word for it . Like old-fashioned science fiction from back in the 1950s , the 1940s , whenever . " You do n't believe me , huh ? " said Vance . " I did n't say that , " said Jack . " Jack , " said Vance , dropping his voice to a conspiratorial whisper . " You know what a computer is ? " " Sure , " said Jack . " A , a , you know . Adding machine . Well-thinking machine , that 's more like it . IBM . In my world , we got this company , IBM . " " Yeah , IBM , okay , we got IBM too . Jack , let me show you something . " Then Vance took Jack into the secret back room and showed him the computer , which was like a TV screen hooked up to a special kind of typewriter . " You can use this , " said Vance . " Over the telephone . Talk to other people . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , they got the newspapers , the TV . But we 've got the Internet . " It was a simple concept , and Jack got the hang of it inside of five minutes . The computers talked to each other , and there was no way the federal government could stop it , there were just too many machines , too many telephone lines . " They got a bunch of new laws , " said Vance . " Arrest us , switch us off , shut us down , throw us in jail . But , bottom line is , they ca n't stop us . " It took another five minutes for Jack to learn how to actually use the Internet . Then Vance gave him a list of Internet addresses and left him to it . For two days solid , Jack hid out in Brooklyn , chain-smoking black market cigarettes and burrowing deeper and deeper into the revelations of the Internet . Alien landings . Alien spaceships hiding behind comets . Supposed American senators who were actually aliens in disguise . The miracle of recovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight back against the invaders . Recipes for helping you determine if you yourself had actually been an alien at some stage of your personal evolution . In the closed , claustrophobic confines of the hideout , the constant reiteration of the hideous truth was overwhelming . It was all there . Anatomical drawings of aliens . Diagrams of alien space ships . Recordings , covertly made , of interrogations in which aliens grilled captured citizens . The secret plans used to brief the crews of the black helicopters . The federal government 's protocols for the planned establishment of the concentration camps . The secret Russian bases , complete with Russian tanks , which had already been built on American soil with the connivance of the American government . The vision of New York as one big lunatic asylum had already been forgotten . Instead , Jack was in the grip of a much more persuasive , much better documented Explanation of Everything . An essentially simple , internally consistent picture which gave him a hard grip on the confused , fragmented and at times totally bizarre reality he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Internet , Jack forgot all about checking out the history of tobacco stocks or inquiring into the rise of the Nazis in Germany . His attention was entirely given over to the authoritative , immaculately presented , intensely detailed accounts of horror brought to him by the Internet . In the face of this horror , the militias were fighting back . The militias were secret armies consisting of people like Vance . Having begun their campaign of armed resistance by blowing up federal buildings and assassinating federal officials , they were now moving into a new phase of freedom fighting , escalating their campaign by targeting foreign embassies , nuclear power stations , airports , subway trains and prominent public buildings of any description . " So , " said Vance , at last . " What do you think ? " " I 'll level with you , " said Jack . " Yeah ? " " It 's like this , " said Jack , taking a big breath . " I ca n't handle it . I 've got to go back . I 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Hey , " said Vance . " It 's your life . I wo n't stand in your way . " And so , seventy-two hours after his arrival , Jack was standing there on the grass of Central Park , waiting for the time machine to return . Vance was there too , together with a couple of his militia buddies , all three of them equipped with absurdly small cameras with which to film the scene . On schedule , the time machine shimmered into existence . Only there was something wrong . The machine arrived in a cloud of dust and smoke , and from it there breathed a dreadful stench of burnt hair and roasted flesh . The thing in the driving seat grimaced at Jack , its seared face one mass of burns . " Jack , " said the thing . It was Kevin . Kevin Culdaneath . Kevin-his rival , the man who had stolen Amy 's heart . " Kevin , " said Jack . " What happened ? " " They nuked us , " said Kevin . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then he said no more , because he was dead . In the ensuing silence , Jack heard crackling flames , and realized the time machine was well alight . It was burning . No way to put out the flames . No way to build another one . The designer of the time machine , Angus Void , was undoubtedly dead . Back in the world which Jack had come from , the world of 1962 , the conflict between the monolithic tyranny of the Soviet bloc and the Free World had proceeded to its inevitable conclusion : a nuclear exchange which must , surely , have reduced the world to ruin . And Jack was stuck here , forever , stuck in an alternate universe in which New York had been taken over by people from Russia , Mexico , and the heart of Africa , in which space aliens had subverted the Constitution of the United States of America and a tyrannous federal government had set out to crush the rights of the people , making cigarette smokers into abhorred criminals and forcing free speech to retreat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , arriving at the run . " What happened ? " " No idea , " said Vance . " We just got here . " " Get anything on video ? . " said the cop , glancing at the little cameras . " No , " said Vance . " We were too late . " Then , as a growing crowd began to gather , Vance and his buddies discreetly retreated , taking Jack with them . " Well ? " said Vance . " What you want to do ? " It was an easy question to answer . Back in the world Jack had come from , the lost world of 1962 , the Free World had been prepared to risk nuclear war to defy the Soviet Union . In this alternate universe freedom , free speech , Constitutional rights were surely still worth fighting for . To Jack , his destiny was plain . It was to join the militia : the heroes of the Third Millennium . " Me ? " said Jack . " I 'm with you . " And they took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
