<p> THE PANHANDLING CAPITAL OF THE U.S.A. <p> Editor  --  Having just returned from a week-long stay in New York City I was dismayed to find myself being solicited by more panhandlers in the short walk from the bus to my apartment than I encountered during my entire stay in New York . <p> I spent time in each of the boroughs of New York City and in all types of neighborhoods but was never subjected to the shaking down that I have come to accept as a part of life in San Francisco . <p> Having traveled extensively around this country , I reluctantly would have to state that San Francisco is definitely the panhandling capitol of the United States of America . I imagine tourists who come to our fine city must be somewhat put-off by having to run a gauntlet of beggars . <p> CONOR O'FARRELL <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> IT 'S ALL ABOUT MONEY <p> Editor  --  I really do n't want to become embroiled in the rent control vs. no rent control controversy , but I would like to ask a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who feel that by doing so a lot of affordable housing would be built . <p> Just where would the housing be built ? San Francisco has little undeveloped space left except for Golden Gate Park and the Presidio . Does one pave over these two parks and create another Manhattan or Brooklyn ? <p> Also the China Basin area is already planned and will be coming on line in a few years so I do not know where one would put massive amounts of housing unless you tear down reasonably sized dwellings and put up monstrous buildings that would dwarf everything in sight . <p> Give me a break ! There is only one reason people want rent control lifted and that is so they can make more money . <p> IRVING WALDORF <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> ALFRESCO IMBIBING <p> Editor  --  Margo Metegrano ( Letters , August 13 ) makes light of efforts to control what she describes so charmingly  --  and benignly  --  as " drinking a glass of wine out of doors , " but despite her " duhs " and " uhs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tequila chased by beer ; those picturesque tables and chairs force strollers , wheelchairs , seeing-eye dogs and run- of-the-mill pedestrians out into traffic . <p> Short of major disasters , neighborhoods  --  and cities  --  seldom go downhill overnight ; however , increased outdoor displays of drunkenness , rowdiness and just-plain disrespect for those who actually live in  --  and pay for  --  the areas visitors treat like Disneyland for ( chronological ) grown-ups sooner or later lead to decline . <p> Once desirable areas become known as unpleasant and unsafe , then even the suburbs-dwelling merchants finally realize no neighborhood survives for long without enforced civility and adherence to laws . <p> SERENA BARDELL <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> PUT A SHOE ON IT <p> Editor  --  I do n't know about you , but I see a certain link between Mayor Brown 's firing of Denise LaPointe from the land marks commission one week and the proposal to erect a giant foot sculpture on The Embarcadero the next . <p> I get the feeling Da Mayor knew that in no way would Ms. LaPointe and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down ( remember the library 's Eccentric Gyratory ? ) . I fear that , after a politically decent interval , this ridiculous project will , uh , march forward . . . Yeah , got ta keep up with Stockton ! <p> While they 're at it they can erect a can of foot powder alongside the sculpture . Then Nike can offer to foot the bill and cover the damn thing with one of their stupid shoes . <p> THOMAS BURCHFIELD <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> PUT A SOCK ON IT <p> Editor  --  A $ 500,000 18-foot " foot " for The Embarcadero ! The mayor must cringe at this naked ped greeting Ferry Building visitors . Would Nike Corporation kick in a size 200 " Air Jordan " ? ( Wilkes Bashford might even offer a stylish sock  --  it gets a bit chilly on the waterfront at night ! ) <p> WALTER BILLER <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> PART TIMERS <p> Editor  --  The labor union 's focus on part time as what 's wrong with current UPS labor practices has the unfortunate side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in general . Clearly the practice of using part-time employees as a strategy to avoid paying benefits is questionable and should be addressed at the negotiating table . But the fact is our work culture is moving rapidly toward widespread recognition of part time as beneficial to both employers and employees . <p> One of the biggest trends has been part-time professional work , especially for women . Currently , there are 7.7 million part- time professionals , not including independent contractors . Most of them negotiated long and hard to cut back their hours to achieve some semblance of work/family balance . <p> The true story on part time encompasses more than the UPS or AFL-CIO . It 's the CPAs , MDs and other career professional women working part time who are quietly getting the work done while at the same time feeling good about their families . For them , part time means a unique package of family values , feminism and fat paychecks all wrapped up in one gloriously shorter workweek . <p> CINDY TOLLIVER <p> ( author of " Going Part-Time , " <p> Avon Books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Editor  --  So the UPS is finally settled . Surprise , surprise . It was always only a matter of time , as the forces of greed and myopia fought in a quagmire to a standstill . Nothing was accomplished that could n't have been resolved without the strike . <p> So what ? So a lot of people were inconvenienced . Many businesses got squeezed . Some were playing on such a thin edge that they were fatally damaged . <p> And to what end ? The new , reformed Teamsters look like the old thuggish Teamsters . And UPS looks like all they can do is run the trains on time , without much imagination , innovation , or decency . Curious thing about those brown shirts . <p> Some day , no one will work for or buy from a company that does n't respect its workers and pay them what they are worth . And then we wo n't need unions . <p> MURRAY AARON STONE <p> Mill Valley <p> . <p> WAS IT ' SATIRE ' ? <p> Editor  --  Debra Saunders evidently thinks she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're sure not getting your money 's worth . Her self-described " satire " column ( Chronicle , August 15 ) regarding " Cal State Diversity " proved that all you 're really getting is a rebel without a clue . <p> Take away the obvious idiocies mentioned in her column  --  like expecting students to read only one book for a baccalaureate , or requiring them to vote Democrat  --  and you have a description of a coherent , positive , enlightened , modern university education . If these goals ( e.g. , learning to think for yourself , becoming a contributing member of society , understanding diversity , and the role of oppression in history ) were included in a mission statement for my campus , I would be happy to sign it . <p> ( And , by the way , why does she think it 's so silly to " vote for . . . any . . . ( political ) party committed to the pursuit of justice " ? Is she admitting what I think she is about her own party of choice , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Professor of Mathematics <p> Sonoma State University <p> Rohnert Park <p> . <p> NOISY BREDAS <p> Editor  --  It looks like San Francisco is stuck with the noisy new Breda streetcars for the next 20 years . In spite of hundreds of complaints from citizens , riders and drivers , the Board of Supervisors decided to allocate the funds to replace the entire Boeing fleet with these cars . A proposal to find a vehicle more suitable for our city streets has been rejected solely based on costs . <p> Unfortunately , the long-term cost of running these oversized vehicles on our streets and the negative effect on the quality of life in our neighborhoods has been overlooked . <p> BILL TRUMBO <p> San Francisco
