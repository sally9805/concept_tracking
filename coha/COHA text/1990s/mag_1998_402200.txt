Biological imperative or social conditioning ? One sister examines the nature of sexual compulsion among brothers who just ca n't seem to help themselves By Audrey Edwards // THERE 'S SAM COOKE , Marion Barry and , of course , Mike Tyson . Let 's not forget the Honorable Elijah Muhammad , the Reverend Ben Chavis or , more recently , the Reverend Henry J. Lyons . From preacher to politician , crooner to slugger , what these and countless other brothers have in common is that they have all been brought low and even taken out by that old slickster , the Johnson . You know Johnson-sometimes referred to as the family jewels . By whatever label , one thing is for sure : Johnson has messed up more than a few brothers ' lives , kept them from thinking straight , acting right , being in control . And smart , powerful men you 'd think would know better seem particularly susceptible to his wild and woolly ways . Now , Black men certainly are n't the only ones whose penises have gotten them in trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such familiar terms with their penises that they have given it singular force and personality , a homeboy name even , and infused it with a mind , if not a brain , of its own . Brothers fondly refer to this most private of parts as " the Johnson " or " my Johnson , " as if it were an entity separate and apart , yet also a buddy , a main-man part of the whole-the alter brother , so to speak . Or , as we like to say of the male sex drive , " the little head that rules the big head . " The trouble with all this , as the recent travails of President Bill Clinton have shown , is that men who can be ruled by their little heads call into question their moral fitness to rule anything else . Sex , to be sure , is a drive , but when it turns into a compulsion it can make men suspect , vulnerable . Much like those who are addicted to gambling or drinking , sexually obsessive men are driven by desires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For some , compulsive sex can even become their final legacy . For example , Sam Cooke , the smooth-as-butter singer of the sixties , is also widely remembered as the brother who was found shot dead with his pants down in a motel room . Marion Barry may have been busted smoking crack , but it was the lure of sex with a prostitute that set him up . And Mike Tyson 's ongoing troubles have frequently revolved around issues with his Johnson . Men , of course , have been chasing sex ever since Adam ate that apple and discovered his own Johnson . And what males of all colors , classes and cultures have in common is their instinctual and often blind pursuit of sex . We take this as a given , part of the accepted , even natural order of things . Men will be men . Boys will be boys . In this regard , contends Robert , a 38-year-old Brooklyn real-estate agent , men rarely view their sexual behavior as compulsive . " It 's just biology , " he says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not to sound crude , " he adds , " but we even call it relieving ourselves . And that 's different from me being in love with you . Because I relieve myself with you does n't attach me to you emotionally . A woman might abstain from sex waiting for someone to love , but men are going to go out and take care of the biological thing , whether they 're in a relationship or not . " Photograph // Okay , biology is real , but so , too , is male sexual compulsion , and , according to Marshall O. Lee , Ph.D. , a psychotherapist in private practice in New York City and New Orleans , it is not all that rare . Lee estimates that about 55 percent of his male patients are sexually addicted-that is , exhibit some form of sexual compulsion . But what constitutes " normal " behavior and what 's an addiction when it comes to sex , because , like breathing , eating and , yes , going to the bathroom , everyone is driven to do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex is affecting a man 's life , " Lee explains . " Is it making his life unmanageable ? Threatening his marriage or the stability of his family ? Is he using it to mask feelings ? " Clinically speaking , the issue is not how frequently or even with whom a man may have sex . " Sexual addictions fall into what we call process addictions , where , as opposed to substance addictions , the addictive behavior is actually related to a process-gambling , lying , overspending , all fall into this category , " Lee says . " With sexual addictions a man uses sex or sexual processes-looking at peep shows , putting a woman 's hand on his dick-as a way to make himself feel better . Just as some people do drugs , sex becomes a way to deaden painful feelings . It feels good . " Robert , probably like most of us , thinks of sexually addicted men as extreme , even freakish in their behavior . These are the men , he says , " who hit it in the morning ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a crack addict , the girlfriend , back to the wife , and then whip it out and get a blow job between cars with a hooker . Now that 's a totally different dog . " Most men , even the biggest dogs , do n't want their Johnsons that out of control . But , as Lee points out , most addictions are not that extreme . Most alcoholics are not lying in the gutter clutching a bottle ; most gamblers have not lost the family home at the crap table ; most overeaters have not dropped dead of a heart attack ; and most sex addicts do n't screw anything with a pulse , anytime . The difference between the kind of sex that is " normally " good and the kind of sex that is pathologically good ( which really means bad ) can be summed up in the SAFE ( standing for the words secretive , abusive , feelings , empty ) model developed by Patrick Carnes , Ph.D. , author of Out of the Shadows : Understanding Sexual Addiction ( Hazelden , $14.95 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicators of sexual addiction revealed in these four questions about sexual encounters : ( 1 ) Is the sex secretive , causing you to lie or lead a double life because of the shame or embarrassment it would cause if discovered ? ( 2 ) Is the sex emotionally abusive to you or others because of the pain your behavior is causing ? ( 3 ) Is the sex devoid of any real feelings ? ( 4 ) Are your sexual relationships empty because of lack of love or commitment ? Most men-and many women for that matter-can probably answer yes to one or all of these questions at some point in their lives , which is not in itself a problem . The problem occurs when the sexual behavior identified by the SAFE model is part of a continuing pattern that does n't stop even when it 's creating havoc in a man 's life . " The man who risks everything in the name of sex is having the same pathological relationship with a mood-altering experience that you can have with a drug , " says Lee . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cocaine . " A large part of the problem , argues Houston writer William July , II , author of Brothers , Lust and Love : Thoughts on Manhood , Sex and Romance ( Doubleday , $10.95 ) , is that " men are fed by society telling them they do n't have to connect with their feelings or be accountable in relationships . " This inevitably leads to sexual irresponsibility , which can also take the form of sexual compulsion . As July himself admits : " I 've felt compelled to do a lot of things I was n't necessarily enjoying sexually . I could be sitting watching professionally typed . I looked for mentions of my mother and me , searched between the lines for clues about those times in his life when he had agonized over me . Even now I sometimes return to his opus , wondering if there 's something I 've missed . But the truth is that other than an occasional mention of " hassles " with family court , direct references to me take up no more than a sentence fragment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2-year-old , clinging to the side of a playpen , staring at him as he bolted out the door for the very last time . " Free at last , free at last , " he wrote . My father was a merchant marine by trade and a gambler to the bone , obsessed with beating the odds at the racetrack , in poker and numbers , and even speculating on California real estate . When his luck ran out , he 'd simply head to the union hall and get assigned to a ship bound for some distant port : Bahrain , Genoa or Santiago , Chile . His remarkably ponderous attempt to set the record straight makes one thing perfectly clear : My mother , the only woman he ever married , and I were minor anecdotes in his life story . Nothing personal ; his interests were elsewhere . Too bad it took me 40 years to find this out . The other girls I grew up with whose parents were n't together still appeared to have contact with their fathers . These girls spoke of birthday presents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend a weekend with " my daddy . " My daddy . My daddy . My daddy . Powerful words to a girl who had no one to say them to . So I said them to myself over and over in my daydreams or at night , waiting to fall asleep , imagining sitting on the lap of a daddy with the haunting good looks of a young Harry Belafonte . Very early on , my obsession with a man who spent his entire life dodging and denying any relationship that made even the slightest demands on his heart became the central drama in my life . The overriding theme , of course , was the fear of rejection , a dire dread that being left by my daddy had marked me for life , doomed me to eternal abandonment . In my teen years , I was awkward around boys , much too much heart fluttering whenever I found myself around some guy who I thought might be The One . As I got older and relationships became more intimate and the emotional stakes higher , fear of rejection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenarios that would bring about the very rejection I dreaded . Eventually I became a consummate expert at rejecting men before they found me out . I was clueless when it came to men . I could n't distinguish one who was deeply devoted to me from one who was only passing through . I felt more comfortable with types who were at best ambivalent and at worst indifferent , emotionally or physically remote , living in another state or another country , moving in another orbit . Such men , I realized only after reading my father 's manuscript , could have been dead ringers for my absent dad . I 've seen signs of the same father hunger in my 7-yearold adopted daughter , who sometimes asks me why she ca n't have a daddy just like her friend Jessica 's . Once while she lay in bed crying because she did n't have a daddy , I permitted myself to cry with her . I wanted her to know that her feelings were legitimate and that I shared her sense of loss . I 'm hoping that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together ( something I never did with my own mother ) , maybe the healing process wo n't take as long . I know that my daughter 's longing for a daddy reflects a natural and primal need for male energy in her life-men who can make her laugh , spoil her , play rough , call her pretty and make her blush . My instincts tell me that a good antidote for her daddy hunger is the company of good men : relatives and friends , the more the merrier-real men , as opposed to a phantom figure who is an all-knowing , all-powerful knight in armor . Yet even the company of good men may never completely erase her hunger . The fact is that unconditional father love , like unconditional mother love , is a precious and rare gift for which there is no substitute . But a father 's presence in a girl 's life does n't necessarily guarantee that such a love will be there . Maybe it 's better to be abandoned by a bad dad than to suffer his abuse . I remember my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was probably better off without him . I assumed then that he was being modest , but when I read his story I understood exactly what he meant . The father who is never there for you is not the father you need . No point in pining over what is n't or might have been . This is a lesson that those of us yearning for fathers do n't easily learn . But once we do get it , we can stand taller and be free .
