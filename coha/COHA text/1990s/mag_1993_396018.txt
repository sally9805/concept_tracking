When Harvard adopted the nation 's first policy regulating romance between students and faculty , Professor Emeritus John Kenneth Galbraith , tongue in cheek , wondered how to atone for his suddenly improper relationship with his wife , a former student he had wed fifty years earlier . Dean Henry Rosovsky replied that Galbraith 's extracurricular relationship was somehow different from the ones being banned , since it had occurred when " amour  --  instructional and noninstructional  --  was in fashion . " Amour , it seems , is less in fashion than ever . In the last few years , at least two dozen universities have proscribed student-professor romances , often without discussion : when the Tufts University provost unilaterally banned such relationships last year , he boasted , " It was just one of those things I felt was not subject to debate . " Opposing the bans , in this context , is seen as defending the right of a professor to work through his ( or her ) midlife crisis in the bed of a freshman . In an attempt to lend a shrill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Magazine invited four academics who oppose such restrictions to discuss the deeper motives and consequences of these bans , and to calculate the hidden damage they do to higher education . The following forum is based on a discussion held over dinner at the Terrace , a restaurant on the campus of Columbia University , in New York City . Jack Hitt served as moderator . JACK HITT is a contributing editor of Harper 's Magazine . He has just completed a book on the medieval road to Santiago , Spain , to be published by Poseidon Press . JOAN BLYTHE is an associate professor of English at the University of Kentucky . She is a scholar of medieval and Renaissance literature and is currently completing a book entitled The Sin of the Tongue . JOHN BOSWELL is the A. Whitney Griswold Professor of History at Yale University . He is the author of Christianity , Social Tolerance , and Homosexuality and is currently at work on An Unhappy Family : The interaction of Judaism , Christianity , and Islam in the Medieval Mediterranean . LEON BOTSTEIN is the president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Symphony Orchestra . He is the author of Judentum und Modernitat , published by Boehlau in Vienna , which will appear in English translation , published by Yale University Press , next year . WILLIAM KERRIGAN is a professor of English and the director of the Program on Psychoanalytic Studies at the University of Massachusetts ( Amherst ) . His most recent book , Hamlet 's Perfection , will be published later this year by Johns Hopkins University Press . I. WHY NOW ? JACK HITT : Students returning to campuses around the country this fall will be resuming a conversation I can not imagine unfolding ten or twenty years ago  --  a debate about whether formal bans should be adopted on some or all student-professor sexual relationships . How did we get here ? JOHN BOSWELL : These bans are very much a result of the rootlessness that is prevalent among the students arriving on campus . In times of social disruption , people tend to rely on institutions and laws to replace more private and traditional mechanisms for maintaining order . This shift is backed up by the widespread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But these are not children we are talking about . In fact , they are at a point in their lives when they are really exploring their erotic feelings . JOAN BLYTHE : One supposition is that freshmen are naive eighteen-year-olds who need protecting . Another is that the university experience can be reduced to a business deal : students pay money , hear lectures , get diplomas , and are provided a secure place in an increasingly troubled economy . An experience that was once one of transformation is now more commonly thought of as a transaction  --  a predictable product for money paid . WILLIAM KERRIGAN : It 's the consumer approach to education . It says : Yes , I want higher education . But I want a warranty that nothing formative , vital , or transformative will happen to me . In particular , should one of my teachers initiate a sexual moment of sufficient power to upset me , I reserve the right to destroy his career . LEON BOTSTEIN : Let 's give the supporters of a ban their due . There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or her teacher . And a sexual relationship between a teacher and a student is , in fact , at odds with the task of teaching . Before we start nailing our opponents as puritans , hypocrites , or idiots , let 's realize that we 're dealing in murky definitions that could cause problems in the conduct of teacher-student relationships . KERRIGAN : This debate forces those , like myself , who abhor the notion of a ban to say things that used to go without saying . Prudery is a great offense against life . Without a sex act , none of us would be here . And whenever civilization sets out a law against a sexual practice or expression , it invariably produces a desire to break that law . That 's the way eroticism works . HITT : Then would n't a ban be good ? Would n't legislation create new and exciting taboos ? KERRIGAN : There already is a connection between student-faculty sex and what Freud called the supreme taboo  --  the incest taboo . Teachers are like parents  --  in loco parentis  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revulsion that prevents relations with students . What we 're creating with these bans are not taboos but punishments . BOTSTEIN : It 's important to grasp that the context in which this student-teacher issue is couched is a political debate in the United States that is , in general , an impoverished one . People are reluctant to really debate political issues . Sexuality has become a substitute for politics . There 's been an erosion of the political interchange . Look at the presidential election . We 're more interested in Clinton 's sex life than his politics . Sexuality has become America 's politics , and the university is a victim of the dissolution between matters private and public . KERRIGAN : I happen to think that the debate over this issue is a real political discussion . Alcibiades in Athens , Nero in Rome  --  such issues have always been part of the political debate , just as sexuality has always been a part of education . The university is not a sex-free environment . Nor is the classroom . BLYTHE : The political debate today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexual identity  --  which includes whom you have relationships with and under what terms  --  is among the most fundamental of issues being debated . II . THE EDUCATION OF A VIRGIN HITT : To hear those supporting a ban on student-professor relationships , you 'd think there were suddenly hundreds of teachers on every campus who are sleeping with their students . But this is n't the case . What kind of phenomenon are we talking about here ? KERRIGAN : I have been the subject of advances from male and female students for twenty-five years . I 've had them come at me right and left . I 've had people take their clothes off in my office . And there is a particular kind of student I have responded to . I am not defending Don Juanism , you know , sex for grades and so forth . But there is a kind of student I 've come across in my career who was working through something that only a professor could help her with . I 'm talking about a female student who , for one reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a strong father , maybe there 's a religious background . And if she loses that virginity with a man who is not a teacher , she 's going to marry that man , boom . And I do n't think the marriage is going to be very good . There have been times when this virginity has been presented to me as something that I , not quite another man , half an authority figure , can handle  --  a thing whose preciousness I realize . These relationships , like all relationships , are hard to describe , and certainly difficult to defend in today 's environment . Like all human relationships , they are flawed and sometimes tragic . There usually is this initial idealism  --  the teacher presents ideas in a beautiful form , and so there is this element of seduction in pedagogy . And then things come down to earth , and there often follows disappointment and , on the part of the student , anger . But still , these relationships exist between adults and can be quite beautiful and genuinely transforming . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that power , one can touch a student in a positive way . So if you want to oppose the imposition of this ban , I say , let 's get honest and describe positive instances of sex between students and faculty . BOTSTEIN : What comes to my mind is , one , a sense of relief that you 're not on the faculty at my college . And two , I 'm not certain anyone wants to make a virtue of a private act . BOSWELL : But what these bans do is conflate the public and private realms . Should we allow the public to interfere in what is essentially a private issue ? BOTSTEIN : I agree , there should be no bans . I am against them . But I share the implicit ideology of the bans . What I disagree with is their political entrance into the public arena . KERRIGAN : I do disagree with their ideology . Sometimes these affairs last a week , and they 're gone . Sometimes a semester or two . Sometimes they grow into things of great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my own marriage . Are you saying you want a generation in which no marriages or affairs result from student-teacher relationships ? BOTSTEIN : I favor a voluntary system , something on the order of a Hippocratic oath . You internalize enough of what people expect so that intelligent , responsible people can make judgments and discriminations by circumstance and event . BOSWELL : I agree . There are already harassment procedures at most schools . BLYTHE : And students are glad of that , but they think the bans are ludicrous . I asked my sophomore Western Lit survey class and my Milton seminar about this ban . One girl said , " I 'd see how many professors I could screw that week . " For others it was an idea they had never entertained and suddenly they were saying , " Hmm , my professor ... " It 's like medieval penitential manuals . In confessing parishioners , priests were warned against bringing up sins not yet committed by asking questions like , Did you give your neighbor 's husband a blow job ? Maybe she just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think the problem is putting sex with professors in the students ' minds . Like William , I have students absolutely throw themselves at me . I had this incredibly attractive jock come to my office when eighty students were applying for fifteen seats in a class . So I had them all turn in a written statement signed only by their last name . I did n't even want to know their gender . So he came to my office after hours wearing nothing but a pair of gym shorts . Not even shoes . I looked him up and down . And he said , " Professor Boswell , is there something else I can do to get into your class ? " And I said , " No , I think you 've done all you decently can . " BLYTHE : Did he get in ? BOSWELL : No . But had I given in to temptation , imagine the complications and necessary subterfuges I would have invited . I think self-restraint is the way to avoid being unfair . BOTSTEIN : The most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like about an overt ban is that it forces people to lie . When you make legislation that ca n't be enforced in human communities , you undermine the law . And on the campus , this distorts the fundamental integrity of the university , which is self-regulation and respect for truth . Instead of admitting that something went wrong , the student acts as we do on the outside . We lie  --  and hire lawyers to get us off . We deny  --  and put our hope in an adversarial proceeding in which the best defense wins . Our stand at the academy should be different . It ought to be about proof and truth and a sensible notion of fact and fiction . What we 're teaching these young people with these adjudications is that those who admit they were drunk or they did something wrong and deal with it openly are fools . III . WHO 'S FIGHTING THE FIGHT ? HITT : Why does this ban seem largely to concern young women and their virtue ? I thought that traditionally the great fear was of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ban is being promoted by feminists , but the homosexual subtext is there . In fact , in a society that did not have this horror of young boys being seduced , I doubt you would see the kind of support you do for the kind of ban we 're talking about . Many , many Americans fear homosexuality . People out there are paranoid about gay men coming on to their sons . BLYTHE : On campuses , where the battle is being waged , homosexuality is not the central issue , because the people proposing these bans are heterosexual and this debate is really about their private lives . About what they fear in themselves , their own relationships and their own desire . The people who voice these concerns are precisely those who desire the eighteen-year-old . These codes have to do with protecting the most privileged of American students . This is not a debate burning at the community-college level . Those pushing for a ban are people who fear real life , especially the protean power of lust . College for them is about isolation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . KERRIGAN : This is a case where the left and the right are in bed together . BOTSTEIN : That 's right , although " left " and " right " are n't great words . The alliance focuses on the power relationship between men and women in the academy . The majority of faculty members are male , and this ban uses the paradigm of male faculty and female student to reveal the abuse of male-dominated- KERRIGAN : The " paradigm " is a generation of academic feminists who push this legislation because in an era when a leer constitutes rape , they believe they are powerful enough to punish womanizing male colleagues . BOSWELL : Why are they so disturbed ? Is this simply one of the few areas they can regulate ? BOTSTEIN : Well , I do think there 's a history here . To give the other side some due , a fair amount of data shows a long tradition of abuse . Graduate students may be the worst-treated creatures , reduced to servility , and if sexuality 's a part , then- BLYTHE : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . BOTSTEIN : Well , you 're assuming something about the quality of the sexual exchange that I do n't want to comment on . But let 's not be unfair . I 've had enough encounters with parents who are not bizarre or crazy , and they are concerned . BLYTHE : What age student are you talking about ? BOTSTEIN : Between eighteen and twenty-one . BLYTHE : Most students at eighteen know more about sex than their own parents . KERRIGAN : Exactly . Who are these women ? Are they all like Anita Hill , who , you 'll remember , testified that she had to check into a hospital with stomach ailments after hearing from Clarence Thomas an account of a Long Dong Silver movie ? BOTSTEIN : Do n't trivialize the critic , please . HITT : Is there some larger agenda or motive behind these bans ? BLYTHE : Yes . The force that is pushing for these bans is abetted by an administration whose agenda includes castration of the humanities . B0TSTEIN : That 's absurd . The administrators have n't sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . They 've run for the hills , fearful of litigation , suits seeking financial damages , and so on . They have simply been forced into this arena , kicking and screaming , by a divisive faculty debate . BLYTHE : It 's a simple fact that these romances are most often found in the humanities . Since the administration is biased against any unprofitable part of the university  --  especially those that ca n't attract fat research grants  --  it 's no coincidence the that administrators have chosen to jump on this issue . KERRIGAN : But in the faculty , who 's behind this ? By and large , feminists . BOTSTEIN : They may be people who have a real concern about victimization . They may be authentic puritans ; still , I respect such people . BLYTHE : Except they 're not puritans . They think non-marital sex is fine , as long as they can control it . BOTSTEIN : Now , wait . Let 's get straight what the proponents of the ban are arguing . They 're not arguing the absence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility by an individual for her or his own actions . BOTSTEIN : No , they 're not . They are suggesting that in the relationship of student and teacher , restraint be exercised . IV . THE OBLIGATIONS OF INTERCOURSE BOTSTEIN : Do we share some residual partial allegiance to the idea that passion and reason are in some sense at odds ? BLYTHE : No . KERRIGAN : No , sir . BOSTON : I assumed as much . I think part of the ban rests on the assumption that there 's something dispassionate about the conduct of reason that passion interrupts . It 's an eighteenth-century construct of the human personality . BOSWELL : The relationship is not antipodal , but it is complicated . KERRIGAN : The problem with the reason/passion division is the assumption that reason recognizes complexity and ambiguity and that passion is this animalistic thing that merely takes possession . Now , I know Norman Mailer is very out of fashion today , but one thing he taught me when I was twenty years old is that good sex is fabulously complicated , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a matter of mindless passion versus complex philosophy . BOTSTEIN : Let me say this : I think sexual relations trigger a set of ethical obligations . BLYTHE : Ethical obligation ? BOTSTEIN : Ethical obligations . KERRIGAN : Ethical obligations ? BOTSTEIN : Allow me to approach it this way . I am partisan , out of obligation , to my parents , my spouse , my children , and other members of my family in a way that overrides fairness . I will stop at nothing to advance them . If I am a judge in a violin competition and my grandmother enters , my opinion would be slanted toward her from the start , no matter what . That 's why judges disqualify themselves . Now , I happen to think that when , as a teacher , you go beyond flirtation with a student , you trigger a set of ethical obligations that override the desire to be fair . I happen to think , as well , that the process of teaching is a process of the adjudication of fairness . So my conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your students , you are in this sense being unfair to the others . BOSWELL : A way to solve that problem is disclosure . A colleague of mine who married his graduate student and continues to write her recommendations should begin his letters , " My wife ... " BLYTHE : I totally disagree . No judgment is purely musical or purely literary  --  purely objective as to merit . It 's always subjective . BOSWELL : You do n't think people should aspire to be fair ? BLYTHE : I think people should aspire to be great . I would hope if your grandmother were the best violinist out there , you would give her the award . BOTSTEIN : What if my grandmother were not the best violinist ? BLYTHE : Then you would n't give her the award . See how it works ? KERRIGAN : What 's tiresome about what you 've been saying , Leon , is the assumption that we have this Kantian moral sense , a system of absolutes that we must either abide by or recede into corruption . You assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligations that override other intellectual perceptions . I would n't describe it that way . If you 're asked to compare your beloved 's talent to that of three others in a contest , you 'll get disillusioned pretty quickly . In the end , you may be in the best position of all to make the judgment or write a letter of recommendation . V. SECULAR PENTECOSTALISM HITT : How is the campus changing ? People in their late thirties and forties say that for them , college was a time to try on new identities , be fitted with a radical idea or two , and experiment in many ways . Nowadays , this line of thinking goes , college is about upwardly adjusting one 's resume . BOTSTEIN : Nostalgia . In the twenty-two years I 've been involved with colleges , there has n't been any appreciable change in idealism . It 's the fraudulent nostalgia of aging people who look back on their college youth and say , " When I went to college ... " Nonsense , wrong . What has changed is the sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost is the sense of comfort people had with an informal relationship between students and faculty . And this involves taking a drink , smoking , and all forms of informality that might result in an accusation of " I have been victimized . " So you restrict your behavior until it 's " beyond reproach , " and what you 've lost- KERRIGAN : Are the rough edges of human beings . BOTSTEIN : Remember Chariots of Fire ? It may have been a bit romanticized , but it showed an Oxford common room where professors offered undergraduates sherry . That 's against the law today . Not possible . Forbidden . A certain sensibility has driven out conviviality . BLYTHE : Where I 'm from , we call it Pentecostalism  --  a desire to have the truth set in stone , Moses-style . This sensibility yearns for sound doctrine that does n't change , is expressed in absolutes , and against which is set a tasty array of penalties . Pentecostalism has an element of the fascist to it . BOTSTEIN : I agree . BLYTHE : Pentecostalism  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure to tell us what to do . It has no sense of history . Pentecostalism shuns ambiguity and distrusts any statement that ca n't be fashioned into a simple certainty . On the most practical level , take course evaluations : Once upon a time , students were asked , " What did you get out of this course ? " Today they are asked , on a standardized sheet , " How effective is the instructor ? " with the options  --  " Excellent ? " " Good ? " " Average ? " " Below Average ? " " Poor ? "  --  in bubbles to be blackened in with a No. 2 lead pencil . BOTSTEIN : In my experience , a recurrent complaint among students is that they had hoped for more informality with professors . Instead , campus life seems more impersonal , " cut and dried , " if you will . HITT : Is the loss of informality a matter of a new and increasingly heterogeneous population showing up on campus ? In a way , American colleges have promoted diversity as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally arrived on campus . Maybe it has everyone nervous . BOTSTEIN : I do n't think it 's that much more diverse . BOSWELL : Maybe not . But the expression of that diversity is different . Calvin Trillin 's new book , Remembering Denny , is about how his generation repressed many of their differences to present a kind of homogeneity , which was achieved then at the price of many people pretending to be someone they were not . Today , that 's no longer the case . BOTSTEIN : This shift turns the idea of the traditional university inside out . In the Middle Ages , the university sought to be a place that was immune from the severity of civil jurisdiction . There was to be a spirit of liberty and self-regulation  --  hence fraternities and other such developments . Now the rules the universities promulgate are more ferocious than those found in civil society . Consider the category of date rape . KERRIGAN : Or offensive speech . The standards are comically higher . HITT : Could n't it be that these kids are begging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heightened expression of differences  --  could one assume that these kids are anxious and confused about what the common code of behavior is ? So they cry out for rules , look to their smart professors for help , but find instead a bunch of liberals who get the willies around " rules . " BOSWELL : You 're right , but our reply is , and rightly so , " Tough . We ca n't make life simple for you . You must think for yourselves . " Getting across this message has always been the university 's ultimate mission . BLYTHE : And look at what gets preserved by such rules  --  a desiccated sexuality . Narrow and pinched , it assumes that sex is merely an act of physical engineering , some kind of biological insertion . Sexuality is not a simple act but the very air we breathe . People can have orgasms sitting in a class listening to a good lecturer . Why are we defining sexuality so narrowly ? It 's a university . The air is alive with sexuality without anyone touching . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexuality , they mean only something harmful . They are not talking about desire , about eros . Education is a kind of desire , the desire to learn . You can not rein it in with the blunt instrument of a policy manual . VI . THE LYRICISM OF A PAT ON THE ASS HITT : Could n't all this confusion on campus be an argument  --  a kind of conversation  --  among disparate groups as they struggle to create a new etiquette , a new common culture with simple table manners and dating rituals for a complex mosaic of people ? BLYTHE : And the only common language among these groups is sexuality . It 's the only common language we have . HITT : Then it makes sense that sexuality is the arena where such a conversation would take place , no ? BLYTHE : Precisely . Everyone 's got a sexuality , and everyone 's most fundamental identity is tied up with it . It 's your history , your first history , and the most interesting history . Each of us is a series of transformations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , girlfriends , husbands , or charged glands in the library . BOTSTEIN : That seems to be the least interesting history to me , frankly . BLYTHE : We no longer have a religious common ground , a shared cultural background . HITT : Therefore , sexuality is the common crucible in which a new etiquette for a more diverse culture is forged . Maybe the only thing we have in common , at long last , are our genitals . BOTSTEIN : I 'm getting very depressed . KERRIGAN : You know , I recently had a serious philosophical debate with a graduate student . Tell me , which is the truer expression of desire for a male toward a female : writing her a sonnet or patting her on the ass ? BOTSTEIN : It depends on whether the person can write . HITT : And , therefore , does it also depend on the quality of the ass ? BOTSTEIN : Actually , for me it would be a really committed performance in music , without words . That would be the highest expression in this higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I can get to the creative power . KERRIGAN : I ask the question because it reveals something about etiquette . A pat on the ass in , say , a redneck bar is not decried as rape but fits into a friendly culture that allows a man or a woman to say , " I like you . I want to touch you . " A pat on the ass nowadays is an interesting problem . One pat and you 're a lout ; more than one , and you are Bob Packwood , hauled to the stockades , buried in lawsuits . BOTSTEIN : I find it all offensive . Call me a puritan . I think a pat on the ass is offensive . KERRIGAN : Really ? There 's something wrong about a hand and an ass coming into contact ? BOTSTEIN : Without consent . There 's the issue of consent . KERRIGAN : Without consent . Imagine it . BOTSTEIN : Without consent , it 's offensive . I am not in favor of it . BOSWELL : Baseball players can get away with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange man on the subway , he 'd punch you in the nose , and I think you 'd deserve it . HITT : I guess I have trouble , too , William . A pat on the ass at the first meeting ? I do n't know . KERRIGAN : Fifth or sixth encounter ? HITT : Well , okay , probably . KERRIGAN : See , following the track of this conversation , you wind up making any pass at a woman into something offensive . Now , flirtation is a matter of etiquette , etc . But it 's a wretched culture indeed that ca n't make room for flirtation some way for one soul to tell another , " I want to touch you . " BOSWELL : Both of you may be right , in that Leon says that etiquette should be observed because it is convention and William is saying that convention can be changed with consideration for human feeling . And yet , William , even though we can change the way we eat , that does n't mean we can ask people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down there . VII . A NOSTALGIA FOR THE STOCKADE BOTSTEIN : It 's interesting . I would argue that students through the 1960s accepted the idea that higher education was about trying on the clothes of adulthood , so they eagerly accepted responsibility for their actions . If they got involved with someone , if they got drunk , if they hurt someone , they sought to take responsibility . Today 's students believe they are not responsible ; quite the opposite , they feel they are owed something  --  an entitlement to a reward from distress . And when they are hurt , they are more prone to call themselves " victims . " Life , as the theologians have taught us for a long time , is inherently victimizing . So when something goes wrong , a student feels empowered to distribute the blame elsewhere . Let 's say a relationship between a student and professor goes sour , for whatever reason . KERRIGAN : It 's bound to . BOTSTEIN : Rather than say , " This is my life , I take responsibility , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to be entitled to some reparation . " And where the puritan character really comes out is in the desire for punishment , a public flogging of a presumed wrongdoer . The ban proponents believe that punishment has a psychic benefit . They want to put the malefactor in stockades and force him to feel the heat of public humiliation . So the final message of higher education becomes not , as John said , " Life is tough , unfair , tricky , difficult , complex ; ergo , learn to take responsibility and live with it , " but " All problems in your life can be reduced to the task of exacting redress . " BOSWELL : People do n't have the attitude " Well , it 's rotten , let 's make it better , " but " I 've suffered , so  --  give me my fifteen minutes of fame . " BOTSTEIN : Or " I feel guilty about my participation in what went wrong . I wish to displace my guilt by focusing on somebody who did it to me . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken about the ill effect these bans have on students . But we forget ourselves , the teachers . Education is also a transformation of us by our students , allowing us to learn and be changed by the encounter of a classroom . This ban is a prophylactic to that kind of fertility as well . It erects a barrier because it presents me , the teacher , as rapacious , predatory , and dangerous even before I walk into the classroom . BOTSTEIN : But does it take a consummation of the sexual dimension to be transformed ? BLYTHE : Of course not . But in setting up a law , you have immediately cast me as a potential raptor . You are emphasizing my role not as educator but as assailant . You define me in negative terms , stripping me of my ability to teach . BOTSTEIN : This is interesting . You 're saying that by writing the law , you are instantly identified as a potential predator ? BLYTHE : Yes . This discussion turns on one of the seven deadly sins  --  lust , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dante , it was the least dangerous sin , closest to heaven and farthest from the pit of hell . If we mean to ban medieval sins on the campus , we should reconsider sloth . We hardly know what the word means anymore . Laziness , people say . But sloth was far more invidious . It represented a kind of passivity that infected the soul so that the sinner was crippled by a refusal of joy . As professors , we all have in our minds an ancient ideal of education , a joyful road of learning . This higher education deals with many of the horrors visited upon us as women and men , but then strives to reach beauty and pronounce a more positive celebration of learning . The ban on student-teacher relations is , finally , a broad attempt to poison the first adult experience for many young people  --  a complex , intimate , at times dangerous relationship with a grown-up who 's not mom or dad . The ban 's proponents refuse to recognize the broad spectrum of sexuality inherent on a campus ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , like Milton 's Satan in Paradise , is undelighted amid all delights . <p>
