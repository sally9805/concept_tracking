<p> As much as the Atlanta Braves are trying to inject suspense into the NL West pennant chase , the real nailbiters are in the races for Most Valuable Player and Cy Young Award . <p> What once seemed a two-way race for MVP between San Diego Padres third baseman Gary Sheffield and Atlanta Braves third baseman Terry Pendleton has been joined by Pittsburgh Pirates left fielder Barry Bonds . Tom Glavine 's stroll to a second straight Cy Young Award has become a free-for-all with the Chicago Cubs ' Greg Maddux . <p> An informal poll of voters last week revealed that both races could be decided by what happens during the season 's final two weeks , though current sentiment seems to be siding with Pendleton and Maddux . <p> Cubs manager Jim Lefebvre will give his pitcher two more starts in pursuit of his 20th win . ( Maddux would become the first Cubs pitcher since Rick Reuschel in 1977 to win 20 . ) Should Maddux reach 20 wins , or should Glavine 's ERA rise above 3.00 , it would appear likely that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That Glavine is 1-4 with a 6.00 ERA in his last five starts especially hurts . <p> Though Sheffield represented the frontrunner while pursuing a Triple Crown , the MVP vote will probably come down to the same two principals as last season . <p> Pendleton could be working at a geographical disadvantage should West Coast voters be swayed by Sheffield , while the 12 Eastern Division writers have witnessed Bonds carry his club without the presence of Bobby Bonilla . Pendleton 's support will come from those who note numbers superior to his MVP year despite chronic knee problems . <p> NL WEST : Though the MVP debate will center on Pendleton , Sheffield and Bonds , the Cincinnati Reds ' Bip Roberts deserves at least passing consideration . Fresh off a record-tying 10 consecutive hits , Roberts has endured consecutive hitless games only twice this season - April 19-20 and May 13-15 . Entering the weekend , Roberts had made 55 starts in left field , 31 at second base , 29 at third base and 11 in center field . He has played more than one position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his average jumped from .308 to .320 . . . . Los Angeles Dodgers first baseman Eric Karros appears a lock to become the third consecutive Rookie of the Year to emerge from a last-place team . Karros 's 20 home runs are the most by a Dodgers rookie since Frank Howard 's 23 in 1960 . Six have come in the ninth inning ; eight have tied games . . . . Oft-injured outfielder Eric Davis is now making noises about re-signing for one year with the Dodgers . Davis , who underwent wrist surgery two weeks ago , said last Wednesday , " I do n't feel like I was brought here for just one year . It 's time for redemption . I want the opportunity to give GM Fred Claire and the Dodgers what they thought they were getting when they traded for m e . " <p> NL EAST : Chicago Cubs right fielder Andre Dawson stands at 398 home runs and reached 2,500 hits last week . With two more homers he will become the 15th member of the 400-2,500 club . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ultimate goal in baseball , " insists Dawson , a pending free agent . " I 'm going to play two more years at the most , but I guess if I was close to 3,000 I could re-evaluate then . " . . . . St. Louis Cardinals closer Lee Smith has nailed down his second straight 40- save season . But the example of crestfallen Chicago White Sox closer Bobby Thigpen sobers him . " I guess they 'll be expecting it every year now . Thigpen went from 57 to 35 and they booed him out of town . " . . . . Cardinals set-up man Todd Worrell , another pending free agent , has stirred interest from the Cubs . . . . Many have wondered how the Pirates have maintained their lead in the NL East . Having become used to despair with the Cleveland Indians , traded outfielder Alex Cole says , " There 's no pressure . There 's just confidence . These guys expect to win every game . They do n't just want to win , they expect to win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 of 18 to the Pirates this season , seconds the notion . " We were always so close against them . It was like a movie , where you are trying to get away and you 're running and you ca n't quite reach that hand trying to pull you up on the train . " . . . . Philadelphia Phillies outfielder Dale Murphy had his problematic left knee drained again last week . He has had eight procedures performed on the knee since last November . . . . Every member of the Phillies opening day rotation has now been lost to injury . After aggravating his arthritic right knee last week , Terry Mulholland was shut down for the season . Phillies GM Lee Thomas was promised last week that he could actively pursue free agents th is winter . Expect him to be preoccupied by pitching . <p> AL WEST : In Chicago they call him " Big Frank . " In his second major league season , White Sox first baseman and Columbus , Ga. , native Frank Thomas is already putting up Hall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first player since Stan Musial ( 1953-54 ) to enjoy consecutive seasons of a .300 average , 20 home runs , 100 runs scored , 100 RBIs and 100 walks . Jimmy Foxx ( 1934-36 ) , Ted Williams ( 1946-49 ) , Lou Gehrig ( 1929-32 , 34-37 ) , Babe Ruth ( 1919-21 ) , Hank Greenberg ( 1937-38 ) and Mel Ott ( 1929-30 ) are the only others to do so . All are in the Hall of Fame . The White Sox selected Thomas with the seventh overall pick of the 1989 draft . The Braves took Tyler Houston with the second pick . The Philadelphia Phillies took Jeff Jackson , who hit .185 at AA this year , with the fourth pick . . . . Minnesota Twins manager Tom Kelly acknowledges that the Oakland A 's did n't win last year largely because of third baseman Carney Lansford 's absence . " He 's the foundation of that team , " says Kelly . " He makes things work , whether he 's on the field or in the clubhouse . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . Speaking of Hall of Fame credentials , McIntire , Ga. , native Kevin Brown became only the second Texas Ranger to win 20 games in a season last week . The only other Ranger to win 20 is in the Hall - Ferguson Jenkins ( 25-12 ) in 1974 . The Rangers began the weekend 23-10 in Brown 's starts , 50-70 in all others . . . . The California Angels have indicated they will trade Jim Abbott if they ca n't sign him to a long-term deal before winter meetings . The Angels have offered him $ 16 million over four years . Abbott , who is not eligible for free agency until after 1994 , is seeking $ 19 million . " I see us at a standstill , " says Angels president Richard Brown . <p> AL EAST : While many teams are using the last few weeks to expose younger players , the Indians are committed to finishing fourth . Veteran shortstop Felix Fermin has replaced Mark Lewis , who was guilty of 26 errors before manager Mike Hargrove made the switch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shortstop , " said Hargrove . " He makes an error and you can see his shoulders droop . Shortstop is a high-profile position . The rest of the team feeds off the way he carries himself . " A former No. 1 draft choice , Lewis was a large reason why the Indians once traded a promising shortstop named Jay Bell to the Pirates . . . . Robin Yount is only the third player to reach 3,000 hits without ever winning a batting title . Lou Brock and Eddie Collins are the others . . . . Milwaukee Brewers rookie Cal Eldred entered the weekend on a 10-game win streak . Eldred is a native of Urbana , Iowa . Population : 600 . " We 've got Roy Hobbs . He 's the natural , " said pitching coach Don Rowe .
