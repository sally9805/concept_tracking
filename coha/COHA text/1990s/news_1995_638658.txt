<p> Fundamental changes may be in store for the Colorado laws that govern almost every aspect of children 's lives , from adoptions and parenting to homelessness and juvenile crime . <p> Soon , 12-year-olds may be prosecuted as adults and parents punished for their children 's crimes . <p> At age 18 , adoptees could gain access to their birth parents ' records . Unmarried men could notify the state of their sexual relations if they eventually want custody of babies that might result . <p> Children might be permanently taken from parents imprisoned for more than six months . <p> All this and more has been proposed by a task force of parents , children 's advocates and agency workers who have spent the last year toiling nights and weekends to rewrite the Colorado Children 's Code . <p> The goal is to see if " the kind of child who needs help can get the kind of help they need from a system that was designed in the 1950s , " said Rep. Jeanne Adkins , R-Parker , who , with Sen. Sally Hopper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the task force . Although parts of the children 's code were rewritten as recently as 1987 , the system was basically in place in the 1950s , Adkins said . <p> Changes in the massive code , which has existed in one form or another for about 100 years , are part of the legislature 's response to the upswing in youth violence in the last few years and a pervasive frustration with social programs and policies affecting children . <p> The code has been based on the idea that young offenders may be rehabilitated through the right mix of prevention , intervention and detention . Echoing a nationwide crackdown on crime , the revisions add emphasis on punishment . <p> Task force members were named and their subcommittees formed last fall to rewrite the code . Now their reports and recommendations are finished , statewide public hearings have been held , and the task force will finish voting this week on which recommendations to approve and forward to the legislature for consideration as proposed laws . A number of bills may result . <p> Arguments within the task force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Take lowering the age at which children can be prosecuted as adults from 14 to 12 for Class I felonies such as murder , for example . <p> Jefferson County Magistrate Babette Norton said it sickened her to cast that vote as a member of the task force , but felt she had to because 12-year-old killers are n't unknown and families of murdered victims need to know their loved ones ' assailants will get more than the standard juvenile sentence . <p> In opposition , Clarke Watson said it was " a real moral travesty to prosecute a 12-year-old as an adult . " Vice-chair of the Juvenile Justice subcommittee , Watson cast a dissenting vote within his committee . Chronologically , psychologically , physically , he argued , a 12-year-old is still a child . <p> " When you put a child in jail with adults , you force a teenaged boy to become someone 's woman , a violation of the Eighth Amendment prohibiting cruel and unusual punishment . " <p> The current children 's code requires prisons to keep young inmates safe in a place where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in doubt . <p> Direct district court filing <p> Though it expands district attorneys ' discretion , said Ray Slaughter of the District Attorneys Council , the idea did not come from them to lower the age at which juvenile cases can be filed directly in district court without going through juvenile court first . <p> Such a law might have caught Michael Park who , at 13 , gunned down Christopher Ramos at an Aurora ATM machine last April . Park was found guilty Wednesday of first-degree murder , aggravated robbery and conspiracy in Ramos ' death . Because he was tried as a juvenile , Park faces only up to five years in juvenile detention . As an adult , Park could have been sentenced to life in prison . <p> In another controversial move , the juvenile justice subcommittee proposes doing away with a young suspect 's right to a jury trial . <p> Juvenile justice 's proposed get-tougher policies extend to parents as well ; these recommendations are a sure bet to win final approval by the task force : <p> There should be no limits to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage done by their children . ( The limit now is $ 3,500 per incident per child . ) <p> Parents should be charged for their children 's out-of-home placements and treatment services . <p> Parents should have to do public service such as graffiti removal , whether their own child 's graffiti or somebody else 's . <p> Parents should be required by law to make a good-faith effort to see that their children attend school . Failure would result in a contempt citation . " Judges are tired of trying to deal with truant kids , " said Juvenile Justice chair Barbara McDonnell , also head of the Colorado Department of Human Services . Now , judges are in the untenable position of placing children in a detention facility to force them to attend school . <p> East High School 's new principal , Rick Arthur , welcomes casting a wider net for truants . " I think we need to do everything we can - including involving parents - to get them off the streets and back into the schools where they need to be . The court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level , the juvenile justice subcommittee recommendations shifted priorities in two new directions , first to greater community involvement in dealing with its delinquent youngsters , second to prevention . <p> Kids need help long before they cross paths with law enforcement and social services , McDonnell said . <p> " Our principal mission is to deal with people whose lives are in crisis . We are there as a last resort . " <p> The subcommittee recommends the governor appoint a high-level adviser dedicated to prevention . But the idea does not impress Barbara O'Brian of the Colorado Children 's Campaign . " On prevention , the real issue is whether more money will be put into programs instead of just a new office , " she said . <p> " The real test is whether the state will shift money from prisons into programs that work directly with kids before they get into trouble . The Children 's Campaign would like the state to put 1 percent per year of prison budget into prevention , " or approximately $ 30 million . <p> Turn toward rehabilitation <p> Punishment-vs. - rehabilitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but members took an almost unanimous turn toward rehabilitation except for one parent , Phyllis Gail . <p> Her " position ( was ) that generally runaway youths were willful and wanton ( requiring ) programs remedial or punitive in nature , " according to the subcommittee report . <p> The Homeless Youth subcommittee wants lawmakers to allow courts to extend the legal status of adults to teenagers at an earlier age , 16 . <p> " We 've been working hard to have that happen , " commented Roxane White , executive director of Urban Peak , a private agency which helps homeless and runaway youths . " We 're talking about youth who 've been abused and neglected . " <p> Unless they are declared adults , kids ca n't even register for school without their parents ' signatures , said White , and they ca n't get those signatures when parents no longer have anything to do with them . <p> White also favored the subcommittee 's request for more transitional housing to provide comprehensive support services for teenagers trying to live on their own . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in abandoned buildings , forced into prostitution and drug-dealing to survive , " she said . " They need a more stable living environment . " <p> Perhaps no subcommittee had greater prospects for a bloodbath among members than Child Protection , Relinquishment and Adoption . <p> Divided between parents ' rights advocates and people involved with child protective services , the subcommittee seemed a setup for disaster . <p> " It was awkward and scary at first , " recalled that subcommittee 's chair , Jefferson County Magistrate Norton . Members learned to communicate by first tackling adoption , where there was little disagreement that major changes were in order : <p> Eighteen-year-old adoptees should have automatic access to their birth records " not because it 's good for adults , but because people who have been adopted need their records to be open , need to be able to go back and find out where they came from for a sense of closure , " Norton said . <p> " Now the age is 21 , but we think that 's silly - you can vote and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know where you came from . " <p> Birth parents still would have the right to bar access if they do n't want to be contacted . <p> The flow of money from adoptive parents to birth parents in prearranged private adoptions needs to be limited . " Now , there 's a lot of money changing hands , " said attorney and subcommittee member Seth Grob . Birth mothers can get so much money for health care , housing and living expenses that often only the affluent can pursue adoption . The committee favors limiting money exchanged to costs of medical care two months before and one month after birth . <p> Create a registry where unmarried , sexually active men could record the occurence of sexual relations that could result in pregnancy . <p> In states where such registries exist , an incidence of sex can be registered for a nominal fee anytime from the morning after to 10 months after . If the mother wants to give up custody of the baby , the registry must be checked and the alleged father notified so he can be considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another mechanism for people who want to be dads , " said Norton . " When people come in to do relinquishments or dependency-and-neglect hearings , there is nothing other than the mom 's word as to who the dad is . We have a lot of people who say , ' I do n't know who the dad is . " ' <p> Baby Richard case cited <p> While the idea of a " putative father registry " lends itself to satire , it could prevent a case like Baby Richard 's in Illinois this year in which a biological father legally voided an adoption of his child and took the 4-year-old boy from the adoptive parents he had known since birth . <p> The registry also could be used to track down a father to assign child- support orders , though a father would be liable for child support , as he is now , regardless of whether he is registered . <p> The adoption subcommittee also plowed into a new area with a recommendation to open adoption records to 18-year-old adoptees , a move tracked carefully by Adoptees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identity crisis , " said Nancy O'Dair of Adoptees . But adults not allowed to know where they came from stay in that identity crisis . When the committee turned its attention to issues of child protection and termination of parental rights , things got rougher . <p> One goal was to curtail " foster care drift " in which too many dependent and neglected children grow up in foster care , never to return to their parents and , eventually , become too old to be adopted . Drift was a key element in a recently settled lawsuit brought against the state on behalf of the state 's foster children . <p> In an effort to get kids out of the system quicker , the subcommittee recommended that : <p> If parents have done nothing to contact their children in foster care for three months , proceedings to end parental rights may proceed . <p> Parents who already have had one child removed from the home because of , say , parental drug abuse do not have the right to a new treatment plan when a second child is born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may go forward . <p> Parents looking at confinement in a mental institution or prison may lose their children if they are n't eligible for parole or release in at least six months at the time their kids are declared dependent and neglected . <p> As with all these proposals , ifs , ands and buts abound . Norton warned it would be a rare case in which both parents were imprisoned at the same time . And the court would be unlikely to terminate parental rights unless it clearly had a better alternative for the child . <p> Steve Stryyssar , a parent-rights advocate on that subcommittee , had some criticism of the revisions . " Families who are not part of the system got nothing " they wanted in terms of subcommittee recommendations , he said . Stryyssar hoped greater limits would be put on child protective services , which investigates reports of abuse and neglect and sometimes removes children from families . <p> THE NEW CODE <p> Some recommended changes in The Children 's Code : <p> ITEM : Guardians ad litem , who represent children in court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Proposed : Stricter standards and regulations be adopted <p> ITEM : Corporal punishment <p> Current : No definition exists . Parents are confused about what they can do .
