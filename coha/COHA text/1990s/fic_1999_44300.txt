Relocation to shed one burden does n't guarantee there 'll be no new ones ! <p> Welcome to your new home , Miss Carstairs . " Dave Mitchell from the Artemis Gamma Home Owners " Association stepped to the side gracefully and let me enter the condominium 's main room . Even though I knew it was thirteen by fifteen feet , the windowless room seemed smaller than I had expected from the sales brochure-until I saw the amazing four-by-five-foot display screen on the far wall . It was relaying a live picture from the lunar surface above us , and the sight of the full Earth hanging over the serenely pristine moonscape was breathtaking . The softly swirling lines of green , blue and white captured the eyes , and their beauty was enhanced by their contrast with the jagged lines of monochromatic light and shadow on the sterile , crater-pocked lunar surface-the barren surface above me ! A line from an old movie popped into my mind : " We 're not in Kansas anymore. , How true ! Not that I was n't reminded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under stable gravity again , but I still felt like I was floating as I walked into the room gingerly and finally tore my eyes away from the wall screen to examine my new home . I was used to my six-bedroom Bryn Mawr house on its grassy two-acre lot , and to my eyes this place seemed suffocatingly small , like all residences in Artemis-Gamma . But it was going to have to be my new home for the rest of my life . My prison ! No more picnics and riding my horses in Valley Forge Park , no more Caribbean cruises , no more stretching out on a towel on the aromatic cedar planks of my deck to soak up the summer sun , and no more fresh air and fresh-smelling spring flowers in my garden . From now on , my life would be bounded by metal walls and shielding soil designed to keep me safe from a freezing vacuum and deadly bursts of solar radiation . I took a deep breath and closed my eyes for a moment , and then opened them again to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a moment I had to admit that as constrained as my future life would be , my new home looked surprisingly like a nice little apartment on Earth-other than the lack of real windows and the curved , eight-foot ceiling that supported the shielding moon dirt above . Pastel walls-a creamy eggshell color-and a short-napped brown shag carpet gave the place a friendly feel that was heightened by the rust-colored and plushly padded couch that waited invitingly along the near wall to face the Video Screen . The low faux-wood coffee table in front of it looked and smelled so much like real teak that I had to reach down to touch it to make sure it was actually reprocessed and scented lunar regolith combined with a polymer binder and coloring . " The room terminal is in here , " Mitchell pointed out , and then pressed what looked like a knot in the wood . " A two-square-foot section of the table flipped up like an old laptop to reveal a LCD screen and a touch pad . " Voice or pad , and you can use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you want . You can also use it to select from the art-gallery files or the audio-vi sual library . We have about twenty thousand movies on file , digitized reproductions from over a dozen art museums , and all the music you could ever want . " He smiled . " And your home is soundproof . " I shook my head . " I 'll be dead before I can explore all that ! " " Ah , but you 'll live so much longer up here , " he pointed out . " After all , that 's why you 're here , is n't it ? " " Yes , but to work ! I have to earn back the outrageous amount that I paid for this place ! " Not entirely true , since my financial consulting agency was very successful , but I enjoyed the challenge of juggling money to maximize profitsfor my clients and myself . " Yes , but you know what they say , " Mitchell tried again . " All work , and no play . . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceded . " Especially if you have any of the old musicals . " " Well , I suppose . . . " He seemed disappointed . " But we also have all the latest SD interactive- " " I pass ! But full Net access ? " He looked vaguely offended that I should doubt it . " Good , then why do n't you let me settle in and I 'll call the Welcome Desk if I need any help . " I had already spotted my bags piled up inside the doorway to the small bedroom . " But I have n't shown you " I think I can figure things out . I studied the brochures before I bought this unit , and I went through the obligatory safety orientation . " He looked vaguely wounded as I eased him out into the hall despite his continued protestations . But as I closed the door and spun the lock-wheeleach unit was air-tight in case of a breach-it proved that he had been right about one thing : the place was soundproof . I leaned against the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The changes in gravity my body had been through the past few weeks were taking their toll , and my heart was letting me know how it felt about it . But I had been given a thorough check-up at the infirmary before following Mitchell down to my new home , and I knew I was fine . I had been warned to expect some mild discomfort until my body adjusted to steady gravity again , and I dropped onto the couch and closed my eyes for a moment before leaning forward to activate the terminal . But before I could open it , the newsdaily that had been si rolling along at the bottom of the wall-screen caught my eye . /// United Nations investigators will be arriving with the next shuttle to the Artemis Delta Observatory to follow up on the mysterious signals intercepted by the leased SETI array . . . Keyword : UN . Signals///More UFO sightings re ported from Farside . . Keyword:sightings /// Then the news summary went on with a slightly alarming solar flare activity report for the upcoming week followed by some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I thought about the UFO sightings . Even here , in the heartland of scientific observatories and laboratories , there was a touch of sensationalism . Which was actually rather reassuring , I decided as I opened the terminal cover . " Audio library , " I prompted . " Selection ? " " Mozart , Eine Kleine Nachtmusik , original scoring and instrumentation . " " Random or Specific ? " " How many recordings do you have ? " I snapped , for some reason irritated . " Seventy-four . " " Just put on the first recording made in this century ! But as the ebullient opening obligingly bubbled out through hidden but wonderful speakers , I calmed down and leaned back to relax for the first time since I had started a long journey that had ended with wedging myself into the cramped Descent Module of the Lunar Transfer Vehicle after the flight from the space station to the moon . This was home now-even if at times I knew it would feel as cramped as the LTV and the Descent Module . I wondered briefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double unit at the end of a spoke . But it was too late for regrets now . I looked around again . The nearly bare combination living and dining area was still bland and impersonal . waiting for my decorating touches , but I had several stitched-yarn wall hangings that would help take care of that . Working on them had been my sanity-saver for the past six months after my last heart attack . I had been a virtual prisoner in the hospital because of a nasty viral cardiac myopathy , and I had been waiting for a compatible heart while hooked up to monitors and pacers and bent over my portable computer trying to keep in close touch with my clients and office . But I had finally told the doctors to screw themselves-an uncharacteristic expression for me that had prompted a few dropped jaws-and I had put in my bid for a unit in Artemis Gamma . The new moonbase community had only recently opened , and they were agg , ressively trying to sell out the last few vacant units . I had gotten a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . But I simply had not been able to take hospital life any longer . I was a very poor transplant risk to begin with , given my additional curse of an unpronounceable vascular disorder-so an artificial heart was totally out of the question-and I was also a very difficult tissue match , and the doctors had all hemmed and hawed every time I tried to pin them down on how long I would be waiting for a donor . The bottom line had been that on Earth I might have another ten years-if I got a new heart ! But I had been told that under the one-sixth gravity on the moon , I could expect at least three times that , new heart or not . Live to a decrepit late fiftiesmaybe-in a sterile , antiseptic-scented prison with no real privacy , or live for at least another thirty or more reasonably comfortable years in a small but attractive condominium on the moon ? That was a " no-brainer , " and I had quickly decided that a three-second round-trip delay on my communications link was well worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did my scheming . Then a chime soured the quiet opening of Mozart 's second movement . I frowned and turned down the volume as I rose to answer the door . I hoped it was n't Mitchell coming to enlighten me about some " important feature " he had forgotten to tell me about . But it was n't . As I swung the carefully counterweighted door open , I found myself facing a wild sight My visitor was a slender and reasonably attractive , dark-haired man in his fifties with a spreading handlebar mustache that looked capable of supporting a small child on either end . " Greetings , dear lady , and welcome to Gamma City ! " he shot out as soon as I closed my mouth . I took his offered hand hesitantly and wondered if I should call security or invite him in . He looked like a madman , with a shock of hair that was as wildly disarrayed as his mustache was impeccably groomed and waxed , and his black and silver tuxedo looked totally absurd when worn with the mandatory anti-static @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmless , " he whispered with a grin . Then he cocked his head . " Of course , maybe I do look a little odd to a newbie . " He straightened formally and in an accentless voice proclaimed : " Heinrich Von Rheinstadt , at your service . Henry to my friends . I have come to invite you to a party We follow GMT as a standard since we have residents from half a dozen different time zones , and accordingly , it is late afternoon . And if you are of a mind to join us , we have an informal welcoming dinner party starting in an hour We have a diverse little community here , a bit different than the more scientifically staffed Artemis Alpha , Beta , and Delta . Among other interesting people , we have a movie mogul , a screen star , one of the world 's foremost best-selling authors , several corporate C.E.O.s , an heiress , and a huckster who made a fortune running pyramid schemes in the third world We do n't all live here year-round , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but as it happens , over half our owners are in residence at the moment . " " And if I 'm not up to coming today ? " I could n't resist . He shrugged " Why , then well have a lovely party without you , and schedule another one when it 's more convenient for you . Maybe in three days when we 're holding a UFO party anyway . " He lowered his voice conspiratorially . " There have been some strange things happening lately . " A strong flash of annoyance clouded his face briefly . " I know . I just saw the news-daily , " I added . " Oh , that . " He dismissed it . " Tabloid stuff " Then he gave me a boyish grin . " But whatever is really going on-it 's a good excuse for a party , no ? " I had to laugh as he waited expectantly . " Fine , I 'll be there . . . if you tell me where " there " is . But , " I looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party , what constitutes a " formal " one ? " He dismissed it with a wave of his hand . " Informal here means wear whatever the hell you want , " and as for a formal party . . . well , if we ever have one , I 'll let you know . We have n't been up here long enough to worry about it . And as for me , I just grab any excuse to wear this tux since I paid good money for it and only used it at my brother 's wedding dirtside . But if you 'll do me the honor of joining me , I 'll return in an hour to pick you up . I was a bit tired , but this was the perfect opportunity to find out about my new home , so I relented . " Sure , I 'll be happy to come . And call me Evelyn . " " Charmed . Then I shall return in an hour . . . or more ? " He raised a questioning eyebrow . " Ninety minutes please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I will be back . " He bowed formally , and then spun to head back up the hall in the bounding , fluid steps of someone used to the low gravity . " Fine . Bye , Henry . . . " But he was already gone , and I chuckled as I closed the door . A " Welcome to the moon party " . . . No , a gathering that would also be a welcome party . Still , it had been a long time since I had been to any party without the smell of antiseptics and the sound of assorted monitors , and it might be just what I needed . Especially now that I realized who Henry was . I even owned a good-sized chunk of stock in his company , Lunar Regolith Limited , of which he just happened to be the founder , chairman , president and CEO . Quite well off to begin with , he had taken LRL from a small venture capital startup operation to a successful corporation that had a virtual monopoly on lunar mining and ore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him to be listed as one of the richest men in the United States . He had also made headlines around the world a few years earlier when his wife and four-year-old son had been killed in a botched kidnapping attempt . He had responded by posting a ten million dollar reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the kidnappers , and after the three men responsible had been arrested , he had used his influence to make certain an ironclad prosecution case landed all three men in prison for life with no possibility of parole . And he had then provided funds to build a new , escape-proof prison with an incorruptible guard system that made sure the killers would not have a comfortable sentence with access to the luxuries all too easy to obtain in most prisons . A pretty determined man when he put his mind to it . He was certainly entitled to a few eccentricities . Wide awake now and feeling strangely excited , I headed to the small sevenby-eight-foot bedroom that took up half of the far end of the unit-the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The kitchen and bathroom were on the opposite wall , and utility lines and emergency supplies were tucked away on the other side of the living room wall , on the opposite side of the entrance . My unit was in one of eight underground radiating spokes that extended out from a large multilevel central hub that housed the control center , the entertainment , community , and utility areas , and on the lowest levels the hydroponics farm . Each spoke was designed to house seven living units situated three on each side of a central corridor with a double-sized-and triplepriced-unit at the end of every spoke . All the units were designed to be selfsustaining for seventy-two hours in case of a major breach or other problems . And in the event of an emergency in the hub , each spoke was also equipped with an emergency exit to the surface at the far end . And the airlock at the surface was set up so that a rescue shuttle could dock with it to evacuate residents . Gamma City , as the third Lunar habitat was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit compact , residential community with fifty-six small homes . I had not been able to bring a whole lot of belongings , given the weight penalty for luggage and the limited space available , but given the alternative , that was a sacrifice I had resigned myself to . But I had brought an assortment of clothes , and I went to my garment case and opened it-thankful for wrinkle-resistant fabrics-and sorted through its contents . Suddenly I had an intense desire to wear a dress . For weeks I had been in low- and variablegrav environments and I was sick of pant suits and jumpers . At first I was torn between a nice casual burgundy and cream pants-suit , and a stylish one-piece gray-and-black DiSorento sheath dress I had bought and only worn once . But then I remembered Henry 's comment and his tux , and I decided that " whatever the hell I wanted " meant just that , and I put away the casual outfit . Besides , if any pictures were taken and found their way Earthside , I wanted to look good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least a few tabloids to show the escort of one of the most eligible bachelors around . And since they would have no problem finding out who I was , I would wind up with some free publicity for my agency . Of course , an expensive dress meant some nice jewelry and a touch of makeup , and after a quick shower , I felt almost giddy as I dressed and rushed to put on the final touches and examine myself in the mirror . I decided that I did n't look bad for an " old broad " who had refused to get any cosmetic surgery . No one would ever mistake me for a young woman , but neither did I look like I was in my late forties . The dress went very well with my newly styled and shorter red hair . But then I cringed as I put on the moon-slippers . Even if they were comfortable , they looked absolutely ridiculous with the dress ! I was tempted to try to find Henry 's number and cancel , but just then the doorbell rang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was exactly on time . Bracing myself , I went to the door and opened it , to see Henry 's mouth drop . " Miss Carstairs . . . Evelyn . I. . . " He straightened and gave a small bow before extending a crooked arm . " May I ? I 'll be the envy of everyone there . " Suddenly the slippers did n't seem so important . Thirty minutes later I had forgotten all about my footwear as I tried to sort out a dizzying array of names and faces , not to mention wardrobes ranging from blue jeans and plaid shirts-but with designer labels-to business suits and pants suits , and even a few more tuxes and exclusive designer evening dresses-and all over the same ridiculous slip pers ! Apparently everyone did indeed wear just what they felt like , and to my relief , people were not segregating themselves by attire . " Even if no one up here is hurting for money , " Henry had admitted , " we all like to complain about it . And since clothes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of attire and being individualistic is a big part of moon behavior . " But bouncing from conversational group to conversational group and dodging the file-cabinet-sized roaming robot-waiters with their drink dispensers was getting tiring , and I was just about to call it quits when the attentive Henry grabbed my arm and pulled me away from a couple of married software engineers , Mr and Mrs. Baumgartner-I had already forgotten their first namesand a movie star named Ralph Lanier who had bought a moon home to get away from the Hollywood hype with his latest wife , Sheryl-his fifth , from what I had heard . " Enough is enough . Now take a break and sit down . " Henry led me gallantly to a bench along a path and I breathed a sigh of relief . The two-hundred-foot diameter community hall in the three-story basement of Gamma City 's hub was a delightful combination of lawn , sculpture garden and greenhouse that I really wished I could have had a chance to explore solo , but I had been quickly pulled into musical introductions . The only saving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly greetings , there had been little more than polite interest expressed , and I had not been forced to constantly repeat my life story to an endless succession of nosy strangers . " We 're a little overwhelming at first , I imagine . " Henry sat down next to me . " But we 'll be eating soon and that should help . I forgot how crazy it can be when one first arrives . Still , we 're all basically harmless . " But a brief frown and furtive glance across the central lawn made me wonder about that . " What is it ? " " Ach , nozzing ! " For a moment , a strong accent blurred his words until he straightened . " I 'm sorry , Evelyn . " His boardingschool English was back . " Just a trace of paranoia . " " Paranoia about what ? " " Later . I promise , " he added when I started to press him . " At dinner . I have a private table . " His voice had dropped to a mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes scanned the other Lunies and locked again on one particular figure . The late-arriving Jack Mioshi was holding court in the sculpture garden now and monopolizing most of the others , which was n't surprising as the Japanese filmmaker held a virtual monopoly on MegaVision Movies and was world famous . Lean and fit as an Olympic gymnast , he looked to be in his late twenties though I knew he was almost fifty . He had a compelling presence that one did n't need to be in earshot of to be affected by . People surrounded him the way Saturn 's rings enhanced the planet ; drawn and held by invisible forces , but kept at just the proper distance for maximum effect . But appearances and intangible commodities were Mioshi 's stock in trade . His company , Mioshi-Sun ( a little triple pun I had always found irritating ) Studios , had been the first to take a combination of Imax , 3-D , and Motor-Motion theater seats where no one else had dared : high-budget action adventure and science fiction movies . Given the scarcity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been successfully marketed before . But he had moved to the United States and approached a variety of business consortiums with techniques ranging from slick-talking persuasion to virtual ( and occasionally actual from what I had heard ) blackmail , in order to put together a chain of the giant-screen theaters . Then he had filled them with a series of technically superb formula films that had drawn larger audiences than anyone had expected . He had correctly judged that American movie-goers were so jaded and sensation-seeking that the uniqueness of the format would bring them in in droves despite sky-high ticket prices . And after taking America by storm , he had extended his empire into Europe . But Earth had not been enough . Mioshi 's latest project was a movie studio under construction on the moon , in Mare Crisium . And now that he was riding high on his success , he loved nothing better than attending parties where he could tell glowing stories of his own accomplishments and future plans . Fortunately he was an entertaining speaker , but I had heard his spiel when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but after checking him out , I had advised my clients against investing in him because my informants had let me know that while his company seemed to be a good investment , Mioshi skimmed off too much of his profit . He was also under federal investigation for questionable business practices . That had been another reason for his move to the moon : he was out of U.S. jurisdiction there . " Food ! " , The anonymous and peremptory voice that cut through the constant cocktail-party chatter was welcome , and I grinned when I saw the studio head glare at the interruption and the immediate defection of his audience . " Serves him right ! " Henry whispered as he took my arm and we headed for the scattered dining tables in the restaurant-like dining hall that partially surrounded and looked in on the community area . The brightness of the light in the hall made me realize that dusk had fallen out in the greenhouse and that light had been provided only by discrete " street " lights scattered along the walk-ways and benches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had not noticed . " We keep a twenty-four clock going here for the plants and the city , " he explained as we sat down at a smaller table by the window looking out over the greenery . Then he spread his napkin in his lap and grinned . " Just wait till you taste your dinner , by the way . Tonight 's fish night , and we grow twenty-pound trout up here .... You do like fish ? " he asked anxiously and I nodded . " Excellent , because the taste . . . " he kissed his fingers , " c'est magnifique ! " He grinned and I had to laugh at his infectious good humor . And dinner was everything he had promised as generous portions of baked fish and assorted steamed hydroponic vegetables were brought to our table . He also proved to be a charming and witty dinner companion , regaling me with stories about his hobbies of sailplane piloting and riding . That led to my wistful horse-reminiscing as I described the two Arabian stallions I boarded and bred , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park for my riding pleasure-which led to the realization that we had a host of mutual acquaintance , s in the equestrian world . But then as dinner ended and we started on a luscious peach sherbet dessert , he turned serious and pulled a small device out of a pocket and turned it on with a single switch . Two small lights on top of it , one green and one red , lit up briefly . Then the red one went out and Henry nodded and laid the sensor next to him where he could keep an eye on it . It was n't hard to figure out why he had brought it , and between the steady green light and the empty tables that separated us from the bulk of the other diners , the privacy was comforting . " We 're secure . " He straightened . " Now I 'd like to ask for your help . " " For what ? " " You have a secure terminal , and I 'd like to use it if I may . I checked you out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I had to ! I ca n't have my clients " investment strategies broadcast out to anyone with a monitor . . . but do n't you have one ? " " I suspect not . " He shook his head . " I 've been up here since my wife . . since Gamma City was built , and by now I 'm sure my equipment has been compromised . " From the look on his face , I had the impression that he would like to have been far away from the moon at the moment . I laid a hand on his lightly , refraining from commenting on his slight slip since he obviously did n't want to pursue it at the moment . Instead , I kept my mind on his question and asked : " ' Compromised " by who ? And why do you need a secure terminal ? " " To start some investigating . . . " He leaned forward to prop his chin on his free hand . " What do you know about Mioshi-Sun ? " " Enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he smiled . " Oh , my dear . You do n't know the half of it . " He eyed the far end of the room where a self-satisfied Mioshi was holding court again between bites . " Mioshi-Sun is expanding beyond movies , you see . Jack grew up a poor little boy without enough toys , and after admittedly making a success out of himself based on hard work , he 's starting to get delusions of grandeur . He thinks he 's a composite reincarnation of Walt Disney , Donald Trump , and Sirhan Kobak . Oh , he 's building a studio , but it 's going to be much more than that . He 's putting up a studio-slash-theme-park with a hotel ; complete with spaceplane service from dirtside to the station and travel via private LTV and landing module to his own field by the park . He 's also going to have MoonBuses going from the park to Farside-he loved 2001 : A Space Odyssey and copied the MoonBus from the movie-and he 's even going to offer-at a premium , of course-rides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I shrugged . " So , what 's the problem ? Hell , I 'll happily be one of his customers , even if I do n't like him personally . It sounds like fun . " " The problem is that several of my geological survey-and-assay robots have disappeared , and always in the same area adjoining Mioshi-Sun property . Every time I ask Jack about it-to see if he 's had any problems-I always get the runaround about what a rough area it is , or he jokes about aliens grabbing them as toys . And he always tries to encourage me to survey in other directions . " Henry frowned . " It 's a gut feeling , but I just know he 's up to something ! " " Have you checked the area out ? " " Well , Jack took me out in a MoonBus over the area to show me how rough it would be for mining , and even offered to buy the whole sector to expand his own park . He said he liked the rough look , and that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Land-Utilization Lease runs out , and that he would just file a claim when my lease runs out and get it for nothing . But he was n't offering enough to make it worthwhile . I still have a year on the lease and there 's plenty of time to start mining . " I glanced over at Jack , but he was n't paying any attention to us so I turned back to Henry . " Think about what you just said . He took you out . But have you checked it out yourself ? I would n't trust Jack any further than I could throw him-on Earth ! " Henry relaxed with a chuckle . " You do know him . " Then he looked a bit embarrassed as he admitted : " Actually , I have n't gone out myself . I 've been too damn busy . But you 're right : I should . " He scooped out the last of his sherbet thoughtfully and then cocked his head and studied me over his spoon . " Wan na come ? But you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bother with a fancy MoonBus like Jack , and it 's a good trip . At least an hour in the open , " he warned me , but there was also a note of challenge in his voice . " Each way ! " Suddenly I was scared . It seemed stupid to be nervous about going out on the surface of the moon , when I had aS ready left the Earth on the spaceplane , transferred to the space station , gone on to the moon in the LTV , and finally been dropped down from the LTV to the moon in the tiny Descent Module . But Henry 's offer was a little frightening for some reason . Henry 's hand suddenly embraced mine warmly as he made an acute guess . " Going out there in just a space suit strapped to a low-flying jalopy is a little different than the nice sheltered trip out here , huh ? " I nodded . " Uh-huh . " He had put his finger right on it . I had qualified in a suit , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the LTV and the Descent Module as a safety precaution-but in each case , I had been inside a vehicle of some sort . Unlike the old descent stages where fully suited astronauts lay on their backs on an open rocket sled , even the trip from LTV to surface had been inside an enclosed-if very cramped-craft . And after we had landed , an access tube had linked us with Gamma City . But then I thought about the parade of doctors , medical students and nurses who had hovered incessantly around me for the past six months , treating me like a condition instead of as a human being and forcing me to give up every ounce of freedom and pleasure because I might drop dead in their fancy state-ofthe-art hospital and spoil some statistic or other . " Oh , oh ! I know that look ! " Startled , I looked up to see Henry grinning from ear to ear as he took another guess : " That 's the " I do n't give a damn what people think , I 'm doing it ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight . " Yes ! " And I explained why , overriding his concern when I described my medical condition : " I got the most thorough damn physicals you 've ever seen-on Earth before I left , again on the space station , and again at the Infirmary when I got here . And the consensus here was that the low-gravity environment is already doing wonders for me . " I patted his hand . " No , I am going . This is my home now , and I want to get a good look at it . " After a moment of concerned hesitation , Henry 's smile returned . " Great . I 'll pick you up tomorrow around lunchtime . As for now , I 'll walk you home . I saw your eyes droop a couple of times during dinner , and I apologize for keeping you up . I know you must be tired from your trip and all . " The next morning I awoke feeling incredibly refreshed after the best night 's sleep I had ever had . Normally , I woke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tightness and headaches , but under the lower moon gravity , I was lying so lightly in bed that my body never had any of the usual little night-fits . It was still early , so after washing up and dressing , I parked myself at the computer to distract myself from any thoughts of my coming adventure . Since it was still night in New York I started by leaving some instructions for my office staff and then settled down to catch up on mail and to check out the European and Asian Markets . It was a relief to be working directly with a powerful mainframe again instead of a cellularnetworked portable server . The time-lag between moon and Earth was a little unsettling at first , but after a while I got used to it , and the chime of the door surprised me as I realized Henry was here to pick me up . After some fast-talking and pressure , I had cleared our outing with the reluctant medical officer-for insurance purposes-and as I opened the door , I felt a surge of excitement . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I could n't wait . Henry was dressed in a neat , bluegray one-piece jumper this time and looked positively professional-except for the combination of wild hair and orderly mustache-and he nodded approvingly as he surveyed my own , similar , outfit . " Excellent , Evelyn . I take it you 're ready ? " I nodded , pushing aside a slight lingering nervousness as I closed the door firmly behind me with a twist of the wheel and followed him up the hall to the hub . Because of the planned duration of our outing , my space suit-and the expensive suit was paid for and mine because that was part of the Home Owner 's Association requirements-was given an extra check-out after I put it on . But it passed with flying colors and I soon joined Henry in the airlock . His thickly gloved hand squeezed mine as the air was withdrawn , and as my suit began to distend I could see him smile behind his polarizing helmet . " You 'll do fine . " His voice was a metallic crackle through our radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free hand as he reached for the door control when the air gauge showed that the airlock had been evacuated . The wide lock door swung open to reveal the sterile lunar surface waiting for us . The covered parking lot was just a short walk away and I followed him gingerly . I did n't want to trip out here , and walking in the suit was harder than I had expected . The gravity was only a sixth of Earth 's , but the suit was awkward and heavy , and inertia and the joint-bellows made it harder to begin a movement , and to stop it , than I had expected . But after a little while I got the hang of it , and I was able to enjoy looking around . Gamma City was virtually invisible as I stopped to look back . Other than the sprawling solar cell farm that spread out in a glittering field on the other side of Gamma City , only the heavily shielded top two floors of the community were above ground . I looked down and wondered whose heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heard Henry laugh as he seemed to read my mind . " Wondering if Jack 's unit is underneath ? " " Not really . " I smiled . " He 's too thickheaded to notice . " Henry chuckled again and pointed to an object parked under the carport-like shelter next to several moon buggies with large tractorlike tires . " Well , well soon see what else he is . There 's my sled . " The open contraption-vehicle seemed a kind word-that squatted roachlike on six spindly legs looked like a wheel-less metal erector-set concoction built by a manic-depressive fiveyear-old with access to a plumbing sup ply warehouse . It was basically a loose-ribbed metal framework surrounding a series of tanks and nozzles , on top of which were perched a pair of large chairs in front of an open cargo bed that looked like it had been pulled off an old pickup truck . " She 's a beauty , is n't she ? " Henry said admiringly , oblivious to my disdain . " We 're taking this instead of a buggy because we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He patted its side . " She 's never let me down yet . " I reserved comment as I climbed carefully up into the passenger seat and eyed the antenna array suspiciously . " We 'll be in constant contact with Gamma Control ? " The monitoring facility in the hub was set up to monitor all surface vehicles , as well as any LTVs and descent modules in transit . " Yup . Latest beacon equipment around . Unless the signal is blocked by a high cliff or something , we 'll always be online with Gamma Control via the Lunar Positioning and Relay satellites . We could n't get lost even if we tried on Farside . " He settled down next to me . " That 's why losing touch with my survey-and-assay robots is so puzzling . " He slid aside a metal shield on the sled 's " dashboard " and tapped in a coded entry on the revealed touch pad . A succession of lights popped on and off , with some remaining lit . " Let me just run my preflight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He leaned forward to study the panel , his helmet reflecting a rainbow of blinking lights as his fingers danced over the touch pad . Remembering his earlier mention of 2001 : A Space Odyssey , I had a vivid flashback to a similar scene in the movie , and I smiled . I was here ! I tightened my seatbelt and held on as I soon felt the sled start to quiver and stir up dust under us as the rocket nozzles activated to lift us silently off the ground . I was reminded of several science fiction movies I had seen , and I chuckled as we silently glided away from the parking area and Gamma City without the whooshing jetlike noises almost always used in the movieseven Mioshi-Sun features . There was just a faint vibration , and the silence was actually strangely reassuring in the ray it lent an almost surrealistic feel to our " flight " at an altitude of about ten feet We were soon moving a lot faster than had expected , and it was n't long before Gamma City was totally invisible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a while the monotony of it set in , and it felt like any long turnpike car-trip . We were heading west , crossing over the top of a triangle of land that Henry had a mining lease on . To the south , I could see the results of his mining company at work , where huge gouges marked the ground as if a Bunyanesque cat had been scratching the surface . Tiny metal fleas were scurrying around the area , except that I knew that these fleas were metal ore carriers the size of a two-bedroom house . But other than that , there was little of interest to see . " Gets old quick , does n't it ? " Henry was reading my mind again and I nodded . " I 'd never have believed it , but it does . " " Well just wait till we get a little further , " he promised . eli be hitting the Badlands soon , and it wo n't be quite so tame . I would never have staked a claim there . but my geologist told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream is building a replacement set of rough-terrain mining robots now and I expect to have them up here in a few months- " " A replacement set ? " " Yes ! Some ecoterrorists blew up the original ones , and there was nothing but scrap metal left ! They were screaming about my " ruining the natural environment of the moon with my mining . " Can you believe that ? " He snorted . " It 's not like there 's some damned spotted owl breeding out here . " I shook my head . " I believe it . I saw their demonstration in New York last year when they were out to stop the airpollution " on the moon . " " Well , that 's actually more legit , " he admitted . " Leakage from the ore-processing plants and habitats are lowering the quality of the vacuum , and a couple of electronics companies had to move their operations . " He laughed . " Lunar air pollution . Sounds like an oxymoron ! " Then he leaned forward to point . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrain . " The Badlands . We 're getting close to where my robots disappeared . " He leaned forward to call up a map in the dash display that showed a trio of glowing dots close to the moving rectangle that was our sled . " Five more minutes and we 'll be right over the area where we lost their signal . " There was an anticipatory edge to his voice all at once , and he was almost growling as he reached back to pull out a small video camera from the satchel he had brought . " What do you think we 'll find ? " I asked . " I do n't know . One , or even two robots getting stuck or damaged in falls I can buy , but three of them have disappeared and there 's no way that 's accidental . " He grunted as he fubled with a connector to strap his camera onto his helmet . " At least one should have survived long enough to send a status report . " He had increased our altitude as we hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we crept close to the indicated area on the map . Activating several sensors , he scanned the ground below us , but obviously he did n't find anything since his low muttering grew increasingly irritated . Finally he stabbed the off button on the sensor array . " Nozzin ! Not a verdammtes Ding ! " I smiled . " Let 's get a closer look . There 's a clear area down there . Next to that cave- " " Cave ? " He leaned forward . " There should n't be any caves here . . . " He manipulated the controls carefully and we slowly sank towards the ground until landing at a slight incline that was quickly leveled by the leg motors . " That 's no damn cave . That 's a mine shaft ! And on my land ! " He was pissed off as he climbed down and made his way across the rough ground to stare into the pitch-black opening . Now that we were on the ground , it was easy to see that he was right . An enormous amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide field , and I realized somebody had been digging for a long time to extract all this material . Henry was sweeping the area with his camera as he moved from place to place to check the ore with a small scanner while making indistinct , puzzled noises . " What 's wrong , Henry ? " I climbed down and joined him , stepping carefully over the loose rocks . He looked up . " There 's prime ore here-all this stuff . My geologist was right . " He indicated the whole field of rubble . " Someone 's saved me weeks of work . All I have to do is come here and scoop it up and take it to the processing plants . It 's as if all they were interested in was digging in . " He turned to the shaft opening and examined its sides carefully . " It looks like robot mining equipment 's been digging here . Just like- " " - like your " destroyed " equipment has been at work ? " I remembered his comment about the ecoterrorists and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only scrap metal left- " " - what if there was only scrap metal there to begin with because someone stole my equipment before bombing the factory ? " Henry finished my thought perfectly . " The only problem with that is that it would cost a lot to get it up here to the moon , and it would be tough to conceal . . . Sceheiss ! " " I did n't need to know German to understand that , and I could n't help smiling as he turned back to me . " Mioshi ! Hell , he could do it easily . He 's got his own damn transportation network . No wonder he wanted to keep me away from here . " He stopped and looked into the tunnel again for a moment before heading back to the sled to grab a lantern from a storage locker . " I 'm going to check it out " And leave me here ? " I grabbed the other lantern in the locker . I was n't about to be left behind , and I think he knew it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All right . But at the first sign of any- " " Any trouble , we leave , " I finished . " But first I want to call Gamma Control with our coordinates and let them know- " " No ! It 's an open frequency and Jack may be monitoring . Fortunately our he met signals could never get out of this valley or whoever did this might already know we found the tunnel , but I am not going to broadcast this on a satellite channel ! " I eyed the enticing opening , dying to explore it , but I did n't quite trust it . Then I had an idea . " Can you set up a time- " " A time-delayed transmission ! " He chuckled and headed back to the sled . " Great idea . " Opening up the dash , he keyed in a sequence and then made a brief recording that detailed our plans and location . " There . " He turned back to me . " If we do n't manually cancel it in an hour , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now come here . " I joined him as he topped off our oxygen tanks from the sled 's auxiliary tank . " Just in case , " he conceded , and then took my arm to re-enter the tunnel mouth . " The mining robots are equipped with sensors so they can follow a vein of richer ore if they find one , " Henry continued as we entered the tunnel and followed it into the hillside . " And the Robo-Miners control miniature ore carriers that remove the mined ore and deposit it outside for pickup-except no one ever picked any of it up . And it 's rich ore . " He sounded puzzled as he played the beam of his lantern across the level tunnel floor up ahead and back behind us . " And from the looks of this , " he went on , " and the amount of ore piled up outside , this digging operation has been going on for weeks ! And the tunnel is heading straight for Jack 's land . It begins just over this hill , about a half-mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then he must have spotted your survey robots and destroyed them before they could send back a report of this dig . But why were n't we spotted ? " I wondered . " There would have had to be human supervisors on site during the initial entry , " Henry explained . " They would have to program the Robo-Miners and test the integrity of the shaft and area until they could be sure it was secure- " " But now it 's all automatic . " " Exact . " He stopped and bent to examine the ground . " Except someone 's been here recently . " I aimed my lantern down and squatted as much as possible in the suit to see skinny tire tracks in a patch of powdery debris . " From the ore carriers ? " " Uh-uh . These tracks cross over the ore carrier tracks-those have a different tread pattern . like that . " He pointed to the other , much fatter , set of tire tracks on he ground . " That would explain the last surveyor that turned up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on automatic , but if someone is bringing stuff out of this tunnel , then they might have spotted and destroyed it . " " But what would they be bringing out if they 're not interested in the ore ? " " Good question . " He glanced at a wrist monitor , and then shone his light down the tunnel and stopped . We had come well over a quarter mile already and there was no end in sight . Straight as an arrow , the rough and curved sides of the tunnel thrust out ahead of us mysteriously , a constant seven feet wide and six high . " This thing seems to go on for miles , " Henry groaned . " We 're going to have to go back to Gamma and get a small buggy . I do n't feel like a multimile trek , and we might not have enough air . " " A buggy ? " " Sure . We can strap a small one right on the back of the sled .... t He stopped and turned and I realized why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a moon buggy approached from the surface , its bright headlights casting their harsh glare across us . A shadowy figure climbed off and slowly approached us . " Hi there , Henry , " a familiar voice greeted us . " I should have known you could n't leave well alone . " It was Jack Mioshi . " And who is that with you ? " He stepped closer , directed a lantern at my helmet , and peered through the face plate . " Miss Carstairs ? Do n't tell me he dragged you out here ? " Squinting , I pushed his lamp aside . " I was n't exactly " dragged " out here . It was actually my idea to come . " " What a shame . " " What are you up to , Jack ? " Henry moved in between us protectively . Jack laughed . " Well , it 's nice to see that chivalry is n't dead . Though I think you 're out of your element here . There are no S.E.C. or Justice Department accountants here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a number of wellarmed employees with minimal morals who will make sure that the considerable millions of dollars I have at risk are protected . " He waved . Meet Mr. Matheson , one of gentlemen I refer to . " A looming figure climbed out of the buggy and stooped to move wordlessly closer , briefly brandishing a strangely shaped weapon I recognized as a vacuum-modified rifle . " But what the hell are you up to ? " Henry repeated angrily . " And what are you bringing out of here ? " Jack laughed again . " Wrong question . I can honestly say we 're not taking out a thing . But I suppose we can enlighten you a bit more . If you 'll please ? " He indicated the buggy . " We 'll give you that buggy ride you were planning . " " I do n't suppose we can pass on it ? " I tried to ignore my suddenly racing heart . I could n't believe what was happening . " I 'm afraid not . Jack actually sounded regretful as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Henry stiffened but I stopped him . " Do n't , Henry ! " I climbed into the back seat of the buggy . " Listen to her , " Jack warned in a strangely intense voice that scared me . " I really do wish that you would have left this alone , because now I have no choice . " As Henry joined me , I did n't want to press Jack to explain since I had a pretty good idea what he meant , even if it seemed too wild to be possible . I just rode silently while Matheson , whose face was invisible behind his visor , followed behind us at a rapid clip with his head bowed and his rifle held ready . " By the way , Henry , " Jack remarked . " My compliments to your design team . Your mining robots are superb , and they saved me millions , even if I did have to pay to bring them up here disguised as construction equipment . We could n't wait for you to bring them up , and besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been too far-fetched . No one would have believed it . " I could tell Henry was dying to ask what Jack was doing with his Robo-Min ers , but he bit his tongue and I followed suit . Mioshi obviously had his own ideas about how to tell us . We rode in silence for another half mile or so , and then I saw a bright light ahead of us . " We 're now on my property , by the way , " Jack declared needlessly . Henry had already pointed out that the tunnel was heading straight for Mioshi 's territory . " And here we are ! " he exclaimed as we rolled into a small artificial cave dominated by an eerie pyramid about twenty feet tall at the apex . Large unfiltered studio lights filled the room with a harsh glare , but the pyramid seemed to absorb the light hungrily as if it was a hole in space instead of a physical object . For a moment , I stared at it in awe and then the truth hit me just as He muttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to me . " A different shape , but I told you he liked 2001 . " He laughed . " No wonder he had to dig laterally over from my property to get onto his own land . " He turned back to Jack . " But I do n't believe you went to all this trouble so you could plant this thing here , and then publicly dig it up on your land . It 's impressive , but you ca n't seriously expect to pass this off as an alien artifact ! It wo n't take an hour before it 's discovered to be fake . " You underestimate me , Henry . " Jack sounded annoyed . " You 're not the only one with a good design team on tap and this cost more than both sets of your mining robots combined . But it 'll be worth it . I 've already convinced in the presentation , you see . If there 's anything I 've learned a moviemaker , it 's that if you give the suckers what they want , they 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much as it will pain me , no one will get the chance to debunk this . " He climbed out of the buggy and went over to stroke the strangely surreal surface of the pyramid . " Special effects , my boy . Special effects ! " He turned to us without explaining further . " We 're almost done here . All I have to do is to reprogram the miner , and arm the fuses , and then get clear . " He sighed . " But you two , I 'm afraid , will become casualties of war . Commercial war , that is . " " How much ? " Henry asked abruptLy . Jack 's expression was unreadable beyond his visor but his body stiffened attentively . " For what ? " " Our lives . Frankly , I do n't give a damn what a bunch of gullible rat-racers think . Let them think that aliens are coming to bail them out of boredom and AIDS infection-paranoia . Hell , it might even make people relax a little . I doubt anyone still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been elevated to just a bit below Godhood . As for Evelyn , all she wants is to live a longer life than she would have had dirtside . " " It 's tempting , " Jack responded after a moment . " But I 'm sorry , I ca n't take that chance . Besides , Evelyn there caused me some major problems when she turned off a lot of potential it vestors a couple of years ago . She cost me a lot of money ! " " You mean you had to stop embezzling for a while to increase your profit ratio , " I cut him off , trying anything to break the grip of the numbing disbelief that was overwhelming me . He was going to kill me ! I could n't believe it . For years I had known exactly how I was going to die , if not exactly when . It was to have been dramatically and rapidly , with perhaps a moment of numbing pain as my faulty heart gave up pumping , or one of my major arteries ruptured , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Either way , I would die either in an ambulance , or in an emergency room or hospital bed with dozens of scurrying doctors and nurses desperately trying to keep me alive . But this ? Just when I had finally started to believe that I might just have a more normal lifetime to look forward to-even if a slightly restricted one ? It wasn't. . . fair ! Henry moved closer and took my arm . " I 'm sorry , Evelyn . All I wanted was to have some pleasant company , and to give you a taste of the environment . I never- " " It 's not your fault , " I snapped , angry at myself for the way I sounded . I turned on Jack . " So what are you going to do ? Shoot us ? " " No , that could be awkward , " he answered matter-of-factly . " If you 're ever found , it will look like a tragic accident , but basically , you 're just going to disapear . Another mystery of the moon . Which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Henry muttered . " With the sightings . " " They 're your doing ? " I guessed . " That 's right , " Jack admitted smugly . " Given the talents of my special effects crew , it was quite a simple job . The hardest thing was to limit the number of people in on it . I do n't want anyone to give " What do you do ? " Henry broke in . " Kill them when they 're done ? " " Do n't be silly . I have a very motivated inner circle . They all have certain . . . aah . . . employment and social handicaps " Convicted criminals , " I ventured . " Exactly . It 's amazing the loyalty a good paycheck generates from people who have had a difficult time getting work . " " And I 'm sure there 's a stick in there also to make sure they stay loyal ? " I felt ill as the air seemed to get stuffy and the suit pressed claustrophobically in on me . Jack nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . " " So now what ? " Henry pressed . " Well , we 're going to leave the two of you here in the tunnel-just a lot closer to the entrance-and then collapse it with a few wired remote-controlled charges . Your radio signal ca n't penetrate all this ore , and if they ever find you , the conclusion will be obvious : You had started some new exploratory mining , and being anxious to show off , you made the mistake of taking Miss Carstairs into an unstable tunnel . A tra ic accident . " He sighed . " But while we 're burying you , the miners will pack in ore around the pyramid and then backtrack a little before blowing up their end of the tunnel . I want them out of the way just in case there is any future digging around where the pyramid will be found . " " Found how ? " I asked , stalling for time to think . " Let me guess , " Henry cut in . UA magnetic anomaly will be detected as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And naturally , you 'll 1l just happen to have your best cam era equipment on hand as you dramatically dig down to uncover this amazing artifact-and you 'll probably manage to have top reporters on hand , too . " " Ah . . . yes . The publicity . " Jack was positively gloating . " You 're so predictable ! " " In that case , what next ? " Jack shot back in an irritated tone . I remembered what he had said earlier . " It 's going to self-destruct . " Jack spun stiffly . " That 's right . And that 's the best part . It will start by sending out a wide-spectrum signal that will bust the eat , drums of every radio listener for billions of miles , as a warning , and then I am going to have my own little meltdown ! " Henry and I both gasped , and Jack sighed . " That was the expensive part . Inside this little package , " he indicated the pyramid , " is an extremely sophisticated miniature reactor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmission , and then it will go critical and melt down-literally-the pyramid and the immediate area . That was n't so hard . A reactor this small is inherently unstable anyway . But it means that this whole section of Mioshi-Land will be lethally radioactive for thousands of years . Forti nately it just happens to be far enough from my hotel so that my many , many guests will be safe , and shielding the tour buses will be simple . Strangely enough , they are already very well shielded . " He chuckled . " You know how paranoid designers can be when worried about safety regulations and insurance . " He was back to his usual loquacious self as he happily finished detailing his admittedly brilliant scam . " Of course , I 'm afraid that I 'll have to raise all my prices when the alien beacon is discovered . The laws of supply and demand , and all that . After all , " he sighed dramatically , " I only have so many hotel rooms . Until I build more . " " Very nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brisk female voice interrupted as three armed figures strode out of the tunnel into the lighted cave . I could just make out the faces of two men and a woman behind visors partly obscured by the reflected glare of the lights . " Drop your gun , Matheson , " a guttural male voice with a heavy Russian accent ordered as the tallest of the men stepped forward menacingly and raised his rifle . Jack 's companion spun , but quickly complied as he saw three weapons leveled at him . The Russian claimed the rifle and then stepped back to cover Jack and Matheson as we moved away from them with relief . " Who . . . " I started , and the woman stepped forward . " lieutenant Ursula Brenner , U.N . Security Forces , Sergeant Ivan Popov , and Corporal Michel Bouchard . " The Russian and the silent second man bowed lightly . " We 've been after Mr. Mioshi for some time . " " On what grounds ? " Jack challenged . " Hiring and transporting fugitive felons on U.N . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of leased property , illegal use of nuclear materials on U.N . protectorate lands , kidnapping and attempted murder " The latter are out of your jurisdiction , " Jack cut her off . " Out of mine , perhaps , but Sergeant Popov is not U.N .. He 's Gamma City Constabulary , " Brenner pointed out gleefully . " And this most definitely is under his jurisdiction . " Behind Popov 's visor , a heavily bearded face split in a wide grin as he began reciting the Revised Miranda to Jack and Matheson , while Michel placed restraints on them . Henry turned to Brenner . " How did you find us . . . - He hit his helmet with a hand and chuckled . " The signal ! " I had also forgotten about it , and I grinned . " Are n't you glad I insisted ? " " Definitely ! " " Actually , " Brenner corrected apologetically , " Mioshi disabled that , but we 've had a tail on him for several days . We 're cooperating with the U.S. Justice Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the moon is out of their jurisdiction . " She turned to Jack . " When you came out here , we did n't know just what you were up to , so we set up surveillance outside . We were a little confused when we saw you bringing material into the tunnel , and we were planning on contacting Mr. Rheinstadt for permission to enter . Until we saw him arrive with Miss Carstairs , just before you returned . " " And then you thought I was helping him ! " Henry burst out with a laugh . " Fat chance ! " Well , we could n't know that , " Popov pointed out as he led the prisoners over to the buggy Mioshi had fetched from the tunnel . " Despite what we heard you tell Miss Carstairs . You could have been lying to her . " " But then , " Brenner added , " we heard him take you prisoner and that gave us probable cause to enter . " " And you followed us down the tunnel , listening in on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how long they had been lurking in the darkness , waiting to make their move while we thought we were about to be killed . Brenner sounded sorry as she added : " We did n't like to leave you hanging , but once we realized you were in no immediate danger , I thought it best to get as much information as possible . And that 's fortunate , or we would not have known about the plan to trigger a nuclear melt-down . " She held out a hand and I saw a tentative smile behind her visor . " Forgiven ? " My initial resentment evaporated as I saw that she was right . I took her hand to shake it clumsily through the gloves . " Forgiven . But do me a favor and do n't tell Gamma City Medical about this . I think they would have a collective heart attack for me if they knew . " " Done ! " She grinned . " In the meantime , I do n't think Mr. Mioshi will mind if we appropriate his buggy to get you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Gamma City Control to take your formal statements . " My legs were weak from relief as Henry took my arm and led me over to the buggy , leaning his helmet against mine to speak strictly through conduction . " Can I take a lady out for an exciting date , or what ? " " Yes , you can ! " I tried not to laugh . " But next time , let 's just try the dining hall , or a picnic in the park , okay ? " " Does that mean that there will be a next time ? " He cocked an eyebrow hopefully as we climbed into the buggy and settled into our seats . I did n't have to think about it and I smiled as I leaned over to touch helmets again . " Why not ? We have a bond now , and it would be a shame not to explore it . " " Great ! It 's been a long time since . . . He fell silent and his hand tightened on mine and he blew me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tunnel to the surface .
