<p> ' VOTE AGAINST INSURANCE INDUSTRY GREED ' <p> Editor  --  Reporter Sabin Russell 's example of leasing a Lexus at $ 449 a month ( " High Cost of Care Drives Reform Debate , " Chronicle , August 15 ) as the cost of a month 's worth of coverage from a standard American family health insurance policy underscores the failure of all congressional proposals to identify and enact reform which includes real cost controls . <p> The current congressional debate , while focusing on the high cost of health care , is failing to eliminate the high cost of the insurance industry , the most vociferous and well financed lobby against meaningful reform . Californians will vote in November on Prop . 186 to eliminate the insurance industry 's misuse of our health care premiums . Prop . 186 will cost a family whose net taxable income is $ 50,000 per year , $ 104 per month . It will cost a family whose net taxable income is $ 100,000 , $ 208 per month . Prop . 186 , the California Health Security Act , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice of doctor , hospital , etc. , to every legal state resident . It will eliminate the greed of the insurance industry . <p> Whatever Congress does ( if anything ) , it will be a compromise between flawed bills . Californians want real change . We want affordable , comprehensive benefits , and we want cost control . The California Health Security Act guarantees all of these . Congress is not going to deal with the real villain , the well financed insurance industry and their powerful lobby in this election year . . . but Californians " will remember in November and pass Prop . 186 . " <p> CATHERINE J. DODD , R.N. <p> California Nurses Association <p> Health Access Committee <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> SUMMING IT ALL UP <p> Editor  --  The Chronicle 's recent editorials on Proposition 187 , the " Save Our State " initiative , are probably quite correct . But it all could have been said in many fewer words , to wit : The illegals are now in control , like it or lump it . <p> MICHAEL MACOMBER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Editor  --  The manipulative use of the acronym " SOS " ( Save Our State ) by the supporters of Proposition 187 sends a misleading message to California voters . The " Save Our State " slogan is contradictory in nature , since , in truth , if Proposition 187 passes , SOS will mean " Sink Our State . " <p> The passage of Proposition 187 would devastate an extensive portion of the needs and desires of all citizens . Education , medical treatment and an unending list of basic rights would sink into a Red Sea of despair , due to an adverse effect on an already patched-up state budget . <p> Yes . . . SOS . . . Sink Our State would create a need for life rafts on a turbulent sea of discontent . California voters must be aware of the fact that Proposition 187 is nothing more or less than a shell game designed to be a punishing weapon that could eventually destroy the American Dream . <p> WALTER L. JOHNSON <p> Secretary/Treasurer <p> San Francisco Labor Council <p> . <p> WHO IS HUFFINGTON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and disingenuous carpetbagger Michael Huffington . As several of your recent pieces concerning his personal history and political record point out , he is n't who he claims to be and is far from suited emotionally or intellectually to be a U.S. senator from our great state . <p> While he claims to be a social liberal and a fiscal conservative , he really is neither . His record on a woman 's right to reproductive freedom seems to extend to those only as wealthy as himself , and his latest vote not to pass the rule on the crime bill only further points out how out of touch he is with the needs and desires of most Californians . He claims to advocate private solutions to social problems , yet he refuses to release his financial records and prove whether his inherited money is where his mouth is . <p> On the other hand , the esteemed and effective Senator Feinstein , a native Californian , gracefully and diplomatically finessed the assault weapons ban through a recalcitrant Senate , despite all predictions to the contrary . She has shown her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this state and has time and time again exhibited strong leadership and pragmatism , as well as ideals instead of dogma . <p> A vote for Huffington is a vote for more crime , less health care and a less secure future for the citizens of this Golden State . Keep after him , continue to contrast his non-record with the stellar accomplishments of Senator Feinstein , and raise awareness of his attempts to buy what he ca n't rightfully earn . <p> ERIC DIAMOND <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> THE DESERT BILL : YES <p> Editor  --  Harry Baker 's letter of August 8 demonstrates why opponents of the California Desert Protection Act lost their fight when the House passed the bill , 298 to 128 , on July 27 . When the facts do n't support their position , they just ignore the facts . <p> For example , Baker ignores the fact that public opinion polls statewide and in the desert region find that an overwhelming majority of Californians support the designation of new parks and wilderness in the desert . Baker also ignores the dozens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and resource needs , such as mineral and solar energy production . <p> Baker knows , but does n't say , that tens-of-thousands of miles of roads and jeep routes will remain open so that everyone can enjoy the region . Baker also did n't mention that the federal government estimates the California Desert Protection Act will likely result in 2,000 new jobs in the region , as well as pumping more than $ 100 million into the local economies annually . <p> That 's why the special-interest groups Baker works for have failed to stop the California Desert Protection Act  --  they rely on empty rhetoric and ignore the facts . On July 27 , the House listened to the facts and voted to preserve a portion of California 's unique desert lands for people to enjoy and to pass down to their children . <p> NORBERT RIEDY <p> The Wilderness Society <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> THE DESERT BILL : NO <p> Editor  --  As members of the League of California Cities , Desert/ Mountain Division , we are disappointed that The Chronicle ( Editorials , July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage of the California Desert Protection Act and the inclusion of the LaRocco/Lewis amendment establishing a national preserve in the East Mojave and the support of the views of desert residents with regard to property rights , law enforcement access and grazing . <p> Every city in this area and the San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors are on record as opposed to this legislation as originally authored . We , the people of this region , do not want the Desert Protection Act to become federal law . <p> We do not see the Desert Protection Act as the correct legislation to solve the problems of the California desert in general and East Mojave in particular . The Chronicle obviously does not understand the position of the desert and mountain cities of the East Mojave . <p> GEORGE RUNNER <p> Desert/Mountain Division <p> League of California Cities <p> . <p> KJAZ , COME BACK <p> Editor  --  My depression has lifted long enough for me to reflect on events both recent and historic . Good and bad , that have had a profound effect on me . <p> I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know where I was when we landed on the moon . I remember Woodstock . And I shall never forget the day KJAZ vanished from the airwaves . I lament the loss . <p> Thank you , KJAZ , for enriching my life these many years . Please , this once , help history repeat itself . Hurry back . <p> SHERRY L. BARSON <p> Larkspur <p> . <p> ONLY ONE ' WOODSTOCK ' <p> Editor  --  Having another " Woodstock " is like telling Van Gogh , do the painting " Starry Night " again . Jeez , give me a break . <p> RIVERBOTTOM BOB <p> Kelseyville ( Mendocino County ) <p> . <p> THE ULTIMATE ' RULE OF THUMB ' <p> Editor  --  To William Chapin who inquired into the origin of the phrase , " Rule of Thumb " ( Letters , August 3 ) , I recommend " The Woman 's Encyclopedia of Myths and Secrets , " by Barbara G. Walker ( Harper San Francisco 1983 ) . <p> In this delectable book , under the heading " Marriage " ( p.593 ) , Walker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blackstone in his " Commentaries " on which British and American law was based through the 19th century , a husband having the legal right to beat his wife with a whip or rod no bigger than his thumb . Also listed as a reference is " Wife Beating : The Silent Crisis , " by Roger Langley and Richard C. Levy ( E.P . Dutton &; Co. , 1977 , pp. 34-36 ) . <p> Walker 's " Encyclopedia " is prodigiously researched , there being 81 references for this heading , " Marriage , " alone , for example . <p> T. G.
