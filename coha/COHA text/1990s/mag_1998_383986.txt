Section : Save a Teenagers Life <p> I ca n't even describe the pain my wife , Barbara , and I felt when the two policemen came to our door to deliver the news that our 18 year old son , Kevin , had been found dead , barely 100 yards from our house , of a self-inflicted gunshot wound . <p> But we were n't surprised . Kevin fit the classic profile of a suicide victim : He had tried to kill himself before , and he had been hospitalized for depression . <p> What was surprising about our son 's suicide was that I was n't able to prevent it . You see , I 've spent my entire 30 year career working with troubled teenage boys . <p> Since Kevin 's death , I 've become actively involved in the issue of teen suicide . I lecture around the country . I appear on radio and television programs . I served as an advisor to the Gallup Organization for its first teen suicide survey . I do this because in the years following Kevin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we-the parents , grandparents , friends , and teachers-can save thousands of young people 's lives . I wish I had known these things in time to save Kevin . But perhaps they can help you . Kevin 's Story <p> I first noticed the change in Kevin the summer between his junior and senior years in high school . He was in the backyard with two of his friends . The boys were building something , and I noticed that Kevin was digging in a frenzy . I asked him what was wrong , but he would n't tell me . Later , he confessed , " Dad , I was thinking about school starting in September , and I think it 's going to be a bad year . An awful year . " He would n't say why . But it turned out he was right . It was an awful year . <p> Suddenly , a boy who got himself up in the morning , fixed himself breakfast , and walked out of the house neat and well-groomed could n't get out of bed , did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instead of talking to his mother or brothers , he would go straight to his room , close the door , and listen to music . He started to spend less time with his friends . The most profound thing , though , was that he shut down his relationship with his mother . He was the baby , the youngest of our three boys , and he was very attached to her . <p> Barbara and I tried to talk to him . We even suggested he talk to a therapist . But he was n't interested . Then , about two months into the school year , I got a call at work from the vice principal of his school . Kevin was going to be suspended . They 'd just found him smoking pot . <p> As I drove to his school , I was wrestling with two emotions . I was angry because he knew better than to fool with drugs . But I was also relieved . Finally , we had a chance to be of some help to our son . And it resulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had with Kevin . His problem , he told us , involved a girl in one of his classes . He had been doing all sorts of stupid things to get her attention , and her boyfriend , a jock , had threatened him . He was afraid . He went on to tell us how unhappy he was in school , how he did n't have any goals , and now there was this kid he was afraid of . I began to think that the relief I was feeling was justified . A Victory-but Short-Lived <p> We got Kevin to agree he needed professional help . He went to see a therapist who was an expert in working with teens . After four sessions , he told us Kevin was under enormous pressure : His self-esteem was being damaged at school . He recommended that we " remove him from the situation . " <p> Kevin , Barbara , and I agreed it would be a mistake to send him back to school . The downside , however , was that Kevin refused to see the therapist anymore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got him a part-time job , but it did n't fill up his life in any meaningful way . At the same time , his depression was growing along with his fear , which was almost to the point of paranoia . <p> I remember a few times when we were driving , Kevin would suddenly duck his head down . When I 'd ask him what he was doing , he would say he thought he saw the boy who threatened him coming the other way . We 'd recently learned from his friends that they knew nothing of the encounter that Kevin said had occurred at school . We were growing more and more disturbed . " Dad , I Want to Die " <p> One night , he had invited a friend to sleep over . In the middle of the night , I suddenly woke up . I do n't know why , but I sensed there was something wrong . I went downstairs where the boys were supposed to be , but Kevin was gone . <p> I went outside and saw that our car was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . A couple of hours later , the police called . Kevin had gone to a park in the mountains where he intended to drive off a cliff and kill himself . But park rangers had blocked the entry to the cliff , so instead , he cut his wrists with a broken soda bottle . When he did n't die , he got back in the car and drove off . He had lost so much blood that he was weak and driving slowly , which is why the police stopped him . <p> When I arrived at the emergency room , they were getting ready to stitch him up . I held his hand , and he looked at me and said , " Dad , I 'm just so unhappy I want to die . " <p> We were fortunate : We were able to have him hospitalized , which is when we learned that Kevin was not only depressed but was also diagnosed as schizophrenic . <p> Kevin stayed in the psychiatric unit of the hospital for six weeks . Then one morning , my wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . We were sure Kevin was still suicidal and told the doctor we were uncomfortable with the decision . But Kevin wanted to come home , and there was nothing we could do about it . He was 18 . He could come home if he wanted to . He could also continue to refuse medication if he wanted to-and he did . Kevin Comes Home <p> When he came home , it was evident that he was very , very fragile . There was such a heaviness about him , like he had a 300 pound pack on his back . He could n't even look us in the eye . I thought it would help if we got away , so I took him to a resort for a few days . But it did n't help . He would barely eat . If someone looked at him , he would turn away . He could n't wait to get back to the motel room so he could turn off the light and go to sleep . It was like watching someone dying . <p> A week after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He sold his motorcycle and bought a shotgun from one of the kids in the neighborhood . He told his mother he was going to visit a friend and shot himself in a wooded area just 100 yards from where we live . <p> I had talked to him that last day about his hurting himself and how we could n't bear to lose him . But I could n't turn it around . I could n't change it . Do n't Let It Happen to Someone You Love <p> I ca n't say for certain that the following measures could have saved our Kevin . But I can say , without a doubt , that I wish we had been aware of them 14 years ago . <p> Do n't be afraid to talk about it . Frightened and ashamed , my wife and I did n't talk openly with Kevin about suicide . We were afraid we would set him off if we confronted his moodiness , so we coped by walking on eggshells around him . Nor did we , as husband and wife , talk enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that no parent puts the idea of suicide in a child 's mind . It 's already on his mind . Do n't be afraid of telling your child that you love him and care about him , but are afraid he 's thinking about hurting himself . <p> There 's a stigma to suicide , but you ca n't let that get in the way of helping a child who needs you . I fully understand now that depression is an illness , not a biblical curse or a moral flaw . Depression has symptoms  --  just like cancer or heart disease  --  and if these symptoms are n't treated , someone can die . ( Know the danger signs of potential suicide . See " Warning Signs " at right . ) <p> Do n't go it alone . I wish we had been more open in talking about our fears with other people . We would have gotten their insights and support and , ultimately , might have had a better plan for taking care of Kevin . Talk to a trusted friend , a member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is a life-and-death situation and the more isolated you are , the less clear your thinking will be . Also , sometimes a teacher , friend , or neighbor will become privy to a disturbing sign manifested by a teenager . It 's only human nature to not want to hear that your child may be suicidal . I remember being taken aback when the emergency room physician told me that if my son could get his hands on a gun , he 'd shoot himself-even though Kevin was there because he 'd attempted suicide . Thank the messengers , and determine if what they 're saying is true . <p> Get help-fast . If your child had a severe pain or were hemorrhaging , you 'd get help immediately . A child who is dwelling on the thought that the world would be better without him needs immediate help too . And do n't settle for anything less than what is essential , whether it 's hospitalization or seeing a social worker or other psychotherapist . If necessary , call the paramedics or the police . Our son refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved his life . Today , we would have other options . We could have insisted that the court keep Kevin in the hospital and force him to take his medication . <p> Enlist community help . It 's easy enough for your family doctor to ask your teenager during an annual physical , " Have you thought about hurting yourself ? " If your community does n't have a suicide hotline , start one . Kevin died before our community had one , and I believe he would have used a telephone service that promised anonymity and a trained , sympathetic ear . If you do have one , keep the number by your telephone . And schools can help by including suicide prevention in the health care curriculum . Kids need to know that if they ever think about killing themselves , there 's help , and they need to get it right away . We wish Kevin had heard that message . Perhaps it would have alerted him to the fatal path he was on .
