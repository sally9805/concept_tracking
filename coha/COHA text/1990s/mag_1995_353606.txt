President Milosevic spoke with managing editor James R. Gaines , editor at large Karsten Prager , Central Europe bureau chief Massimo Calabresi and correspondent Marguerite Michaels <P> TIME : Many say that if there is hope at all for finding a political solution to the Bosnian war , it ca n't be done without Milosevic . <P> Milosevic : Maybe they are right . Maybe they are not . Who knows ? I 'm just an ordinary man who , by the circumstance of his position , can help by having a policy of peace , one that is honest and objective to all sides . We accepted the Contact Group plan which proposed a 51-49 division of war-torn Bosnia and Herzegovina between the Bosnian-Croat federation and the Bosnian Serbs . Before that , we accepted whatever plan was more or less evenhanded . We said from the beginning that there is only one solution for Bosnia and Herzegovina : one that will protect equally the interests of the Serbs , the Muslims and the Croats . <P> TIME : How do you get there ? You clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get him to free the hostages but not enough to get him to accept the Contact Group plan . <P> Milosevic : The taking of hostages was an immoral act . We had to do whatever we could just to eliminate that dirty story from the history of Serbs . <P> TIME : Why ca n't you do the same for the peace plan ? <P> Milosevic : Until sanctions end , Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic will count on Serbia collapsing under sanctions . For the Muslims , it is not important if that happens in two years or 20 . They dream of a situation in which we collapse and then they with all their allies achieve their goal of establishing a Muslim state in Europe . The other side , the Pale leadership , since we are under sanctions , is counting on us finally getting involved in that war , that finally we will be involved in that war . If sanctions are lifted and relations with that main factor of stability , the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , are normalized , Izetbegovic and Karadzic must face each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what could happen . <P> TIME : You talked about the humiliation of the hostage taking . Certainly it is no less humiliating for Serbs to have the Serbs in Bosnia using rape and detention camps in their prosecution of war . Could n't you have called on Karadzic to stop it , especially when you had relations with him ? <P> Milosevic : When we first heard via the foreign press that there were some detention camps and rapes , our first reaction was , " What about that ? " The Bosnian Serb leadership explained , " It is absolutely not the truth , absolutely not . " That was what was explained to us , and we then had a very deep confidence in what they were explaining . And I believed that just because of habit . One detail reported in the press : a Muslim girl who was pregnant by rape got shelter in a hospital in Switzerland . An abortion was not possible , and when the child was born , it happened to be Negro . No Serb was a Negro . Not one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lover of radical Muslims worldwide , has reported that 90% of the atrocities committed in Bosnia and Herzegovina were perpetrated by the ethnic Serb side . <P> Milosevic : I do n't have those kinds of figures . But it is absolutely unbelievable in that civil war .
