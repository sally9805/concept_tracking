Consolidate your e-mail updates . Nearly three years after American Airlines originally hit upon the idea , most major airlines now send subscribers a midweek e-mail announcing a handful of fire-sale flights available that weekend . And while the deals are often a steal ( New York to London for $239 , anyone ? ) , the proliferation of these programs can make staying on top of them a chore . Use the table on page 146 to figure out which airline e-fare program is most likely to offer flights to and from where you live . Then you can cut down your e-mail clutter even more by visiting SmarterLiving ( www.smarterliving.com ) , where you can sign up for a free weekly e-mail that consolidates all the Web travel specials being offered by 20 major airlines departing from your choice of 41 cities . At the site itself , you can search anytime for latebreaking deals . The Deal Watch section of InsideFlyer magazine 's WebFlyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard DiDonna , a Washington , D.C. legal assistant , has made last-minute e-fares part of his regular travel repertoire . He 's taken advantage of such deals six times in the past two years , jetting off to places like New York , San Diego and St. Croix . " I saw the fare to St. Croix was $229 on Tuesday or Wednesday , called my fiancee , and we were on a beach that Saturday , " he says . ( The lowest recent 14-day fare for that route was $589 . ) It ai n't all sunsets and pina coladas , however . Nabbing these fares can mean contending with limitations and annoyances . DiDonna 's St. Croix flight , for example , left from Baltimore-a sacrifice he happily made , but a one-hour drive from D.C. , nonetheless .

And what about the much-hyped Priceline.com ( www.priceine.com ) service , which promises , tantalizingly , to let you " name your own price for airline tickets " and , lately , hotel rooms ? Although the service has its fans , we say pass . Why ? Because too much control of the transaction has been taken out of the customer 's hands . Once you bid a price , you ca n't back out , even though you wo n't know the exact time of the flight , the carrier or whether you 'll have a stopover until your bid has been accepted . If your bid is rejected , you have to alter your itinerary before resubmitting an offer . If you 're desperate to reach a specific destination at the eleventh hour , a better bet is to call your travel agent or the airlines : Both often have access to deals not available elsewhere . Do n't ignore hotel and car rates . Air fare is clearly crucial , but too many travelers make the mistake of thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got your air fare , you 're a last-minute walkup for the hotel , " says Laurie Berger , editor of the Consumer Reports Travel Letter . " And they may try to stick you . " Best advice : Even though you have to act fast to get a last-minute air fare , do n't book that flight until you have reserved a room and wheels . Although some hotels and car rentals require a deposit , you can typically cancel the reservations up to 24 hours in advance with no penalty . With a plane ticket , you 're out the money whether you go or not . // THE EIGHT MAJOR AIRLINE E-FARE PROGRAMS // For car and room deals , start by looking at the airline e-mails and the WebFlyer and SmarterLiving sites . Most match bargain air fares with discount rates from major hotel chains and carrental agencies in the destination cities .

You can also try to snag a room through hotel-chain reservation systems or by calling the front desks of individual hotels themselves . Always ask for the cheapest room , what " specials " the hotel has going and if you can get a discount for being a member of AAA , AARP or another association .
