Section : THE TIME MACHINE MAY/JUNE <p> By the time Citizen Kane finally made its debut on May 1 , 1941 , Radio City Music Hall had refused to show the picture and the Palace Theater had taken on the premiere instead . Orson Welles had spent the six weeks since his film had originally been scheduled to open directing a Broadway adaptation of Richard Wright 's Native Son . The controversial play , telling the story of a black man accused of murdering a white woman in Chicago , was well received . It made an ideal distraction for the young director as he waited for the difficulties surrounding Citizen Kane 's release to be resolved . <p> When the newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst learned he was the model for the fictionalized Kane , he scared off wider distribution of the film by allowing friends to make threats on his behalf against RKO Pictures and by calling Welles a " Communist " through his army of newspaper columnists . In early January Hearst gave the order to refuse RKO advertising in his papers nationwide . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kane bought up . Welles himself publicly offered RKO Pictures a million dollars for the rights to the picture and threatened his own lawsuit against the movie company for delaying its release . <p> Despite RKO 's attempts to make Kane sound like a harmless love story ( " What made this cutie walk out on $60,000,000 ? . . . Neither she  --  nor any woman  --  could endure his kind of love ! " ) , theater owners were intimidated by rumors of a lawsuit as reported by Louella Parsons , Hearst 's star gossip columnist , who had attended a screening of the film accompanied by two lawyers . The film 's unconventional story line also worried RKO brass : A reporter follows conflicting stories of Kane 's friends and enemies to pursue a mystery he finally abandons . The film blended the lives of Hearst , the publisher Robert McCormick , the financier Samuel Insull , and Welles himself , whose own childhood mentor was the basis for the banker guardian of Charles Foster Kane . <p> The film grossed nearly twenty-four thousand dollars the week it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after nine weeks . William Randolph Hearst and the actress Marion Davies , upon whom Kane 's mistress was based , attended the film unrecognized in a small San Francisco theater .

" <p> Lou Gehrig died June 2 of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , a little-known and incurable disease of the spine that had left him , at age thirty-seven , sadly diminished from the " hulking figure " he had once been . One sportswriter , describing Gehrig as a rookie , wrote that " the boy picked up a bat  --  one of Ruth 's , by some curious chance  --  and advanced to the plate . He was obviously nervous , missed the first two pitches , then bounced one weakly over second base . Then he hit one that soared into the right field bleachers , high up , where only Ruth had ever hit a ball .... He hit another ball in there  --  another  --  still another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's enough , ' Manager Miller Huggins cried . He turned to the players . ' His name 's Gehrig . . . " ' <p> Unlike many of the flamboyant characters with whom he played , Gehrig was pretty much what he seemed : a soft-spoken stoic who was good to his mother and could hit a ton . He batted cleanup , behind Babe Ruth in the Yankees ' famous " Murderers ' Row " lineup of the late twenties and early thirties . Ruth had spent much of his youth in a school for wayward boys and lived life to its wildest ever after ; Gehrig , by contrast , lived quietly with his parents in New Rochelle , New York , until his marriage in 1933 . After the game , recalled a Yankee clubhouse attendant , " he 'd be the first one dressed and on home to his momma .

Despite injuries to his hands , spasms in his back , and attacks of lumbago , Gehrig managed to enter every regular-season game from 1925 to April 30 , 1939 , his final appearance as an active player . He finished with a .340 lifetime average , 493 home runs , and 1,990 runs batted in . The acceleration of his spinal disease in 1938 prevented Gehrig from hitting above .300 for the first time since his rookie season . During his famous farewell at Yankee Stadium in 1939 , Gehrig , with tears in his eyes , called himself " the luckiest man on the face of the earth . " Soon after , the new Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown , New York , waived the normal five-year wait for eligibility and inducted the dying man . <p> In June the Roosevelt administration took further steps to prepare for the spreading war in Europe .

The President was not one for gloomy assessments and refused to believe initial reports from his military commanders predicting that the Red Army would be destroyed within weeks . Confident that the Russians could hold out against Hitler 's army , Roosevelt planned to meet with Winston Churchill at Argentia , Newfoundland , in August to discuss long-term strategies for the war . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Publisher Hearst , model for Welles 's Kane . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Gehrig near the end , Yankee Stadium , 1939 . <p>
