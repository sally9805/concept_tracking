ART <P> RICHARD POUSETTE-DART : A RETROSPECTIVE , Indianapolis Museum of Art . Overshadowed by such contemporaries as De Kooning and Pollock , the pioneering Abstract Expressionist Pousette-Dart , 74 , is here done belated and handsome justice . Through Dec. 30 . <P> THE WANDERERS : MASTERS OF 19TH CENTURY RUSSIAN PAINTING , Dallas Museum of Art . The Wanderers spurned the Moscow Academy and took their work to the Russian people in the form of touring shows , which became rallying points for social change . This exhibition gathers some 100 of their canvases , most never before shown or even reproduced in the U.S. Through Jan. 6 . <P> MUSIC <P> RUBAIYAT , ELEKTRA 'S 40th ANNIVERSARY ( Elektra ) . If a company has to give itself an anniversary toast , this is an intrepid  --  and often amusing  --  way to do it . Thirty-eight current Elektra artists ( from Tracy Chapman to Metallica ) polish up some tunes from Elektra 's past and take them out for a Sunday drive . Surprise is constant on this 2-CD set , satisfaction frequent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First Girl I Loved ) available on request . <P> BRENDA FASSIE : BRENDA FASSIE ( SBK ) . An American debut album with heavy credentials , having more to do with politics than music . Fassie and Nelson Mandela claim tribal kinship , but the first fleet sounds of the African- inflected , dance-floor-destined opening cut blow away any notions of obligation to genealogy , or to conscience . All on her own , Fassie 's just fine . <P> THE ISAAC STERN COLLECTION , VOLS. 1 &; 2 ( Sony Classical ) . These boxed sets , spanning the years 1946 to 1958 , can serve as the foundation for a violin concerto library or as a reminder that , though he has de-emphasized his playing to pursue benevolent causes , Stern is one of the truly great violinists of the century . <P> MOVIES <P> WHITE PALACE . James Spader and Susan Sarandon bring so much intelligence and redeeming prurient interest to this May-September romance that the movie is almost over before you realize it 's just another story of rich boy falling for poor woman . Say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hot . <P> JACOB 'S LADDER . Vietnam vet Jacob Singer ( Tim Robbins ) is seeing things : whirling heads , killer cars , villains everywhere . Is he a conspiracy victim ? Or is he dead ? And if so , will any moviegoer care ? Adrian Lyne 's revved-up spook show plays like a Twilight Zone episode on steroids . <P> HIDDEN AGENDA . This contentious melodrama blames British intelligence for everything from political murders in Northern Ireland to sabotage of the Wilson and Heath governments . But even conspiracy buffs may find it hard to be stirred by Ken Loach 's dour direction . Paranoia deserves better than this . <P> TELEVISION <P> COP ROCK ( ABC , Wednesdays , 10 p.m . EST ) . Steven Bochco 's much hyped experiment seems doomed unless the ratings pick up . Catch it while you can : the station- house drama is compelling , a few musical numbers have clicked , and the rest of the fall season is a bore . <P> IT ( ABC , Nov. 18 and 20 , 9 p.m . EST ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil force that takes the shape of a clown . TV rarely ventures into real horror , and this clunky mini-series based on Stephen King 's novel shows why . There are more shudders in an average episode of Twin Peaks .
