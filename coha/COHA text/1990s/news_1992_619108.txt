<p> Just a few months ago , fortress Intel Corp . looked vulnerable . <p> Rivals were stealing its customers . Longtime allies joined with foes . A federal agency began searching for signs that the chip giant had abused its power . <p> Yet Intel is suddenly stronger than ever . <p> The latest to be won over : personal computer pioneer Steven Jobs . After three rocky years riding a rival hardware technology , Jobs ' Next Inc. this week will announce plans to offer its sophisticated software on computers that use the Santa Clara-based company 's microchips . <p> One by one , ballyhooed technology-development efforts that threatened to reduce Intel 's influence over the personal computer business have largely been neutralized . A monolithic standard for PC software is weakening . But the replacement is at least seven competing formats  --  and they all work with Intel 's microprocessors . <p> " We are really the only common denominator , " declared Andy Grove , Intel 's chief executive . <p> True , Intel has lost the most lucrative monopoly in the history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloned Intel 's hit 386 chip last year and grabbed 30 percent of that market . An arbitrator 's ruling in a few days may also award Sunnyvale-based AMD some hefty damages for Intel 's alleged violations of a technology-sharing agreement between the companies . <p> But , paradoxically , AMD and other 386 clonemakers may ultimately increase the popularity of Intel 's underlying chip architecture by reducing the risk for customers who bet on it . And they spurred Intel to action . <p> Among other things , Intel is giving customers detailed information about its next superchip , code-named the P-5 , due out next summer . One source said the company may even break with tradition by avoiding the chip 's expected 586 name , which would make it easier to protect as a trademark than the widely known x86 nomenclature . <p> " Architectural leadership is ultimately what builds the business and brings the profits , and Intel is still the innovator , " said Erik Jansen , an analyst at Alex . Brown &; Co . But he added : " If AMD had not shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggressively . " Microprocessors act as the underlying brains for computers , much as engines power cars . They are matched with operating systems , complex software that handles basic internal functions . Both elements determine ground rules for application programs , such as word processing programs and spreadsheets . <p> Intel 's extraordinary franchise started in 1981 , when IBM Corp . chose its microprocessors for the giant company 's line of PCs . Along with Microsoft 's DOS operating system  --  which only works on Intel 's x86 chips  --  a technology standard was born that spawned sales of more than 100 million IBM-compatible PCs . <p> Profits grew with the 1986 introduction of the 386 . It was Intel 's first chip to process 32 bits of data at a time , double the rate of earlier 16-bit units . More significantly , Intel stopped its longtime practice of letting others manufacture its designs under license ; it became the sole source for the most popular and profitable chip around . <p> Despite a slow economy and AMD 's competition , the juggernaut seemed to pick up momentum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Motorola Inc. in 1991 to become the biggest U.S. chipmaker and No. 4 worldwide . Despite the recession , earnings in 1991 rose 22 percent a record $ 819 million , while sales surged an equal percentage to $ 4.78 billion . Intel 's cash horde swelled to $ 2.3 billion from $ 1.8 billion . <p> In one of the most surprising measures , productivity as measured by revenues per employee , rose from $ 175,000 to $ 197,000  --  a level of efficiency that tops even the least bureaucratic small chipmakers . " Intel is the world 's largest startup , " Grove said . Investors responded . Intel 's stock rose 5 points the day after its earnings were announced , and the stock is now up 56 percent since early December . It closed Friday at 62 1/2 , up 1 1/2 . <p> And there was more evidence of Intel 's new offensive  --  new products , expanded factories , reduced prices and a shift away from the 386 to the more profitable , proprietary 486 chip . Intel vows to churn out 4 million to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter alone , up from 2 million for all of 1991 . <p> " The 486 business is growing faster than the 386 business is going away , " said Andrew Kessler , an analyst at Morgan Stanley . " AMD is gaining market share but in a declining market . Intel is on a growth curve . " <p> The 486 , Intel proclaimed , is now the chip of choice for business PC users . Its executives condescendingly referred to the 386 as technology for " home users and hobbyists , " analyst Jansen said . The P-5 wo n't show up in large volume until next year . <p> Intel 's campaign started inauspiciously with the introduction of an entry-level chip called the 486SX , which was actually a 486 chip with some disabled transistors so it no longer performed certain mathematics functions . <p> To upgrade a computer to add those functions , users must buy a new $ 600 chip called the 487 , which is actually a complete 486 in disguise . When the add-on chip is plugged in , it completely replaces the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much sense as putting two engines in a car . <p> " If you look at it from Intel 's internal point of view , it makes a certain amount of sense , " said Michael Slater , editor of Microprocessor Report . " But it certainly riled customers like nothing Intel has ever done before . " <p> Intel has been much more successful selling the idea that it wo n't be displaced by an entirely new standard for desktop computers . But things looked black last year . <p> Customers were angered by shortages of Intel 's 386 and other popular chips , as well as the fact that their supplier also sold complete computers . Competitors accused Intel of illegally threatening to withhold proprietary products from anyone who bought clones of other Intel chips , a charge it denies . <p> PC makers envied the rapid speed gains produced using reduced instruction set computing ( RISC ) , a more simplified design technique than Intel uses . Meanwhile , the Microsoft DOS software system that runs on most Intel-based machines became outdated . <p> Sun Microsystems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workstations . They used powerful Unix software that was designed for 32-bit microprocessors and can perform sophisticated tasks that business computers will likely demand in the 1990s . <p> Suddenly , longtime Intel customer Compaq Computer and Microsoft in April spearheaded an alliance called ACE based partly on RISC microchips from Mips Computer Systems of Sunnyvale . A few months later , Intel ally IBM was proclaiming an unprecedented pact with Apple computer that was partly designed to exploit an IBM-designed RISC chip . <p> But customers do n't buy promises  --  they mainly want application programs that solve their problems , and writers of those programs back vendors with the biggest installed base of users . Intel has a huge lead in those areas . <p> As a result , ACE , IBM-Apple and later Sun Microsystems separately hedged their bets by making sure that advanced operating systems on their drawing boards also worked with Intel 's chips . <p> " Having great technology is not enough , " summed up Ed Zander , president of Sun 's SunSoft subsidiary in explaining why its Solaris software is being converted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get you customers . " <p> The expected speed of Intel 's coming P-5 chip  --  more than 100 million calculations per second  --  also works against Mips and other RISC advocates . " If Intel 's claims for the P-5 are borne out , they will have basically caught up with RISC , " Slater said . <p> CHART ; <p> INTEL CORP .
