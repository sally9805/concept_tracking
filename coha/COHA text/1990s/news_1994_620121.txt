<p> After decades of cramming into traffic courts begging for a break , motorists during the past year have virtually given up fighting parking citations in San Francisco , one of the most heavily ticketed cities on Earth . <p> Because of a 1993 change in state law that clamped down tightly on the protest process , ticket challenges in San Francisco in the past year plummeted 80 percent , according to a review of city parking records . <p> The long San Francisco tradition of lining up in traffic court to fight a glove box full of parking tickets was replaced last year by strict new rules that ban the operatic excuses that once saved pleading drivers huge sums . <p> The big winner is City Hall , which has collected $ 2 million more in parking fines . The losers are motorists who now face a daunting process of filing complaints by mail or phone before making a personal plea before no- nonsense hearing officers . <p> " In the past , you could amass a lot of tickets , then go down , give a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Molinari . He is president of the Parking and Traffic Commission , which slaps " Molinari said . " Only people with legitimate beefs are going to be heard , and we 've cut down on the scofflaws . " <p> The dramatic drop-off in protests has come despite an overhauled system that allows drivers for the first time to challenge their tickets by mail and phone . But the new law , which transferred parking protests from the Municipal Court to the city 's parking department , makes it nearly impossible to win unless a lucky driver can prove the ticket was written in error . <p> Before 1993 , crafty drivers were able to accumulate tickets for up to three years , go down to the Hall of Justice or City Hall and plead to have them reduced or dismissed . More than 2,000 citizens a week would show up to fight an average of 4.3 citations per visit . Hard-pressed traffic judges , gazing at the long lines , would often chop the total owed by half or more . <p> Under the new law , rigid deadlines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing officers no longer have the authority to reduce the fines to settle a dispute . Barely 400 drivers are now showing up for hearings during an average week . <p> Meanwhile , ticketing in San Francisco has continued at the same phenomenal pace over the last two years , at about 2.3 million citations per year , or 38 percent of the 6 million parking tickets issued each year in all of California . <p> " This is an excellent , excellent system , " Molinari said of the complaint procedures . <p> " For the people who have always played it fair , this is a much better system , " he added , pointing out that lines for hearings are now short or nonexistent and that protests by phone and mail are much more " user-friendly . " <p> Under the new state legislation , motorists have 21 days to mail or phone in a protest of their tickets , stating the reasons for the challenge . After that time , they permanently lose the right to fight the ticket . The city then investigates motorists ' claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faded curb paint or obscured signs . <p> If the protest is denied , the motorist has 15 business days in which to appeal the ruling before a hearing officer . <p> According to city records , 78 percent of initial written or phoned protests were denied during the program 's first eight months . Motorists fared better at the next stage before the hearing officers , winning dismissals about 50 percent of the time . <p> Last week , 34-year-old Brian Miller was one of the winners . At a Hall of Justice hearing , he challenged a $ 25 ticket that said he had parked 30 percent into someone 's driveway . Miller claimed that he was only three or four inches into the driveway . <p> Hearing officer George Milinovich resisted Miller 's argument , noting that the citation said there was a witness who had called in the complaint and the officer clearly stated 30 percent on the ticket . Looking over the citation closely , however , Milinovich noticed that a box had not been completed for the expiration date of the vehicle 's registration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free-lance graphic designer , said afterward he was relieved he had dodged the $ 25 fine . " I 'm suffering economic hardship right now , " he explained . <p> Even though hearing officers are employed by the parking department , they are required to remain neutral and must dismiss all violations with even a minor mistake on the citation , Milinovich said , adding that " we have to hold the department accountable . " <p> Several minutes passed before the next person arrived . Milinovich , a mortgage broker when not working 16 hours a week as a hearing officer , did not accept the woman 's claim that the address on her $ 25 street-sweeping ticket was wrong  --  and that therefore the violation must be thrown out . She argued that she lived next door to the address . <p> Milinovich explained that that was not a valid reason and he could not dismiss the citation . <p> Lisa Stephenson , manager of the department 's 13 part-time hearing officers , said the new guidelines do not give the officers much leeway to dismiss tickets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court commissioners . <p> And although the average driver is paying more , the parking department has tried to spread the pain more evenly during the past year . <p> Under new guidelines , the department has cut back on the parking immunities previously enjoyed by consular officials and city , state and federal employees . <p> For example , a police officer using his personal vehicle can no longer send the ticket in and get it dismissed by claiming he was on official business . Instead , the officer must submit a written reason on official Police Department letterhead with a supervisor 's signature . <p> " After we send out that requirement notice and return their tickets , only one third of them come back with the required paperwork , " Stephenson said . <p> But Molinari said the FBI is another matter . " They should observe the parking laws like anyone else , " he said . " It 's been tougher to get them to comply . But we 're still working on it .
