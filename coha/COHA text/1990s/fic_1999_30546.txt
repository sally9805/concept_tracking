Chapter 1Excalibur . All of the senior officers were going to be there and , frankly , it was going to be a good opportunity for Robin to impress her superior officers with her organizational skill . In a way , it seemed a rather trivial exercise . All the solid duties that Robin carried off in the course of a day should have been more than enough to warrant attention and promotion from the rank of ensign which she currently carried . Yet the simple truth was that people could be impressed by the damnedest things , and Captain Mackenzie Calhoun and Commander Elizabeth Shelby might be just as likely to find her duties as hostess as memorable as anything she did at ops . It did n't make any sense , but people were just funny that way . Morgan could see the gathering in her mind 's eye . There would be Calhoun and Shelby , bantering over brisket or some such preparation . Their attraction for each other was electric , and their knack for short-circuiting that same attraction was just amazing . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud , with his young sister , Kalinda , next to him . Morgan had only caught a brief glimpse of her , having contracted her illness right after Kalinda ( " Kally " as he called her ) had come on board . The girl had looked older than she had originally envisioned her , equivalent to an earth child in her late teens instead of the very young girl that Si Cwan had always described . Morgan reflected that perhaps the way he described her was the way he saw her . She could n't help but wonder whether that attitude might cause problems down the line . This new fellow , Xyon , she had n't seen at all . Supposedly he was the son of Captain Calhoun , but no one seemed to know quite what to make of that . Well , whatever the situation between them was , certainly it could all be worked out . Calhoun was nothing if not innovative when it came to the realm of personal relationships . The door to the quarters slid open and Morgan , using what little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed as she called out , " Robin ! How did it go ... honey ... " The term of endearment died in her throat as she saw the dishevelled condition of her daughter . The front of Robin 's dress uniform was covered in what appeared to be frosting . There was a small bruise on her forehead , and her hair  --  which had been neatly arrayed in a very becoming ' do  --  was hanging down around her face . Her expression was carefully stoic . " It could have gone better , " Robin said . " My God ! What happened ? ! " Robin said nothing at first . Instead she walked across the room to the closet , from which she withdrew a towel . She used it to start wiping away the frosting from her uniform and the ends of her hair . " Robin ! Tell me what happened ! " " This , " Robin said slowly , tapping the frosting which was now covering the towel , " was the welcome aboard cake . It had Xyon and Kalinda 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also had my name on it . " " What do you mean ? " " I mean I was the one who wound up wearing a good deal of it , so that 's why I said it had my name on it . " " I still do n't understand ... " Robin sighed deeply as she peeled off her uniform to toss it into the ship 's laundry . " There was some friction . " " Seems to me more like there was total combustion . " " Xyon , " continued Robin , as if her mother had not spoken , " is having a bit of difficulty working and playing well with others . " " What others ? " " Captain Calhoun . Oh , and Si Cwan . " " What happened ? " asked Morgan . Robin sagged into a chair as she pulled on a short bathrobe . Her hair was still a mess , and the bruise was getting darker . She ran her fingers sadly through her hair and shook her head as she looked into a mirror and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual in the reflection . " It started nicely enough , " she recounted . " Everyone was standing about , chatting . Everyone except Xyon . He did n't seem especially happy to be there . I went over to him and asked him if something was bothering him . He told me all he really wanted to do was get his ship fully repaired . Apparently his ship sustained some damage in escaping the nebula surrounding Star 7734 , and there were some other repairs made to it that were simply stopgap in nature to begin with . His ship really needed an overhaul , and Captain Calhoun was more than happy to offer it since Xyon had been of such help in the entire Kalinda affair . " " So ? " prompted Morgan . " So he was spending the party keeping in a corner off to himself . In retrospect , if he 'd just been left there by everyone , allowed to stew in his own juices and maybe be sociable on his own terms , then maybe matters would have turned out differently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Captain Calhoun , trying to engage the boy in conversation . Now Xyon , he 's making it clear to the captain that he 's not interested in talking to him . Apparently there was some sort of falling out , or Xyon felt that Calhoun had n't been much of a family , or something like that . In any event , Xyon was brushing him off . Everyone saw it . It was openly disrespectful . But it was obvious to everyone that the captain did n't want to make a big deal about it . That his attitude was , ' If this is how Xyon feels , I 'm not going to fight with him about it . Let him work it out on his own . ' Which was pretty sporting of him , if you ask me , considering that the first time they met each other , Xyon hauled off and slugged the captain . " " Yes , I know . Word of that spread rather quickly , " Morgan said with a dry sense of irony . " Xyon was fortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other cheek , so to speak . I have no doubt that the captain could put him through a bulkhead if he were inclined to do so . " " Well , he almost had the inclination , " said Robin . " After he brushed off the captain , Xyon started to leave the party . " " Did he have any of the buffet before left ? " Robin stopped talking and stared at her . " The what ? " " The buffet . " " Mother , who cares ? " " I do . You worked very hard to set it up . " " I do n't know if he did . I do n't care . The point is , he started to leave ... and then Kalinda stopped him . She seemed very anxious to talk to him . She sat down with him and soon they were laughing and having a grand time . " " Oh ! Well , that 's good , " said Morgan . " No , that was bad , " Robin corrected her . " Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So he rather politely asked Xyon to stop monopolizing her time . " " Oh . That 's bad . " " No , that was good , " said Robin . " Because at least he was polite about it . He was nothing but civil to Xyon . " " Oh . So that 's good . " " No , that was bad , because Xyon took offense anyway . I believe he said , ' After everything I 've been through to save your sister , I ca n't believe that you would try to prevent me from having some private time with her . ' " " Oooo ... that is bad . " " No , that was actually good . Because Captain Calhoun overheard , and stepped in on his son 's behalf , telling Si Cwan that Xyon was absolutely right , and Si Cwan should give them some distance . " " Oh ! Well , that 's good . " " No , that 's bad . Because Xyon told the captain that he could handle the situation himself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frowned , and then shook her head . " I lost track . Are we up to bad or good ? " " It does n't matter . The point is that Xyon put his arm around Kalinda and tried to walk out of the room with her . I do n't know whether he did it in order to show that no one told him what to do , or in order to annoy Si Cwan , or what . But Si Cwan grabbed him and pulled him away , telling him that no one manhandles a princess of Thallon . And then Xyon shoved Si Cwan , and Si Cwan shoved him back , and the captain got in the middle and there was more shouting ... " She shook her head in disbelief . " It 's hard to understand how it spiralled out of control , that quickly . One minute I was standing there chatting with Shelby about something perfectly innocuous , and the next thing I know , someone is slamming into me  --  " " You were attacked ! " Morgan 's voice bordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got hit on the rebound . And I fell into the cake . And there was more shouting , and anger , and security showed up as Lieutenant Kebron restored order pretty quick , but they needed a cleanup crew and ... " She put her face in her hands . " God , what a mess . " " Robin , it was n't your fault ... " " And if everything had gone swimmingly , Mother , that would have been something I 'd get the credit for , right ? So when it turns into a debacle , as this did , who are they going to blame ? " " You 're being much too hard on yourself . " She coughed several times to try and clear out her lungs . " Maybe I deserve it . I mean , look at the way things are going , Mother . Maybe fate is trying to tell me something . " " Tell you what ? I do n't understand  --  " " Well , first I decided to tell Si Cwan that I have strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the mission to Montos ... except by the time I did it , he was gone . And then I offered to conduct the entire reception , arrange everything , set it all up , mostly to make him happy ... and it became a huge misfire . Maybe somebody up there , " and she pointed , " is trying to tell me something . " Morgan looked up to where Robin was pointing . " Up there ? You mean on the bridge ? " " No , Mother ! " she said in exasperation . " I mean ' up there . ' You know . Divine intervention may be trying to get a point across . " " You 're overthinking it , Robin . " " No , I 'm not . Nothing goes right for me . " " Now you 're just dissolving into self-pity , Robin . I wo n't have it , " Morgan said sternly . " You 're made of better and stronger stuff than that . So instead of complaining about how everything goes wrong for you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman that I know you can be . Clear ? " Robin 's jaw twitched in irritation , but finally she sighed heavily and said , " Clear . " She went into the bathroom and took a shower . By the time she came out , she was sneezing and her temperature was starting to climb . As she blew her nose , she looked daggers at her mother . " Thanks , Ma . I 'm sure the cold you 've apparently just given me will serve me as well as your advice . " Morgan rolled her eyes and pulled the covers over her head . As one , they sneezed . Xyon sat in his quarters , chair tilted back , whistling softly . He was bare to the waist , having cleaned up after the debacle originally intended as a welcoming banquet for Rie  --  for Kalinda . He had to keep reminding himself that her real name was Kalinda . His long blond hair was newly cleaned and hanging around his muscled shoulders . There was a chime at his door . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apparently I have misbehaved and am in isolation . " The door slid open and Mackenzie Calhoun was standing in the doorway . " Actually , what with being the captain and all , I can come and go as I wish . " " That is what you excel at , is n't it ? Going ? As you went from Xenex after leaving my mother pregnant with me ? " Calhoun sighed deeply . " Xyon ... grow up . Whatever disputes you have with me , they do n't begin to excuse what took place at the banquet . " " I 'm not looking to excuse myself to you , Captain . I do n't care what you think . " Calhoun shook his head . " That 's not true . If you did n't care what I thought , you would not have acted , and reacted , as you did . You would have ignored me , or brushed me off . You would not have taken a swing at me , certainly , and tried to hurt me . " " I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . You could n't . Particularly if I 'm ready for you . " Xyon 's eyes flashed . " Is that a challenge ? " " No . Simply a statement of fact . " Instantly , Xyon was out of his chair . It was an impressive burst of speed . Anyone else would have been very hard-pressed to get out of his way . Calhoun sidestepped and drove his knee up into Xyon 's midsection . Xyon gasped and Mackenzie slammed him in the back of the neck , sending Xyon to the floor . Xyon lay there , momentarily stunned . He could n't understand it . He was as formidable a fighter as they came , and had handled any number of opponents with facility . So what in hell had just happened ? As if reading his mind , Calhoun sat down next to him and said , " You rushed it . Also , you were probably a bit daunted by the fact that I am your father . " " I was n't ... daunted . " " My mistake , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead silence in the room then for an uncomfortable period of time . " How is Catrine ? " Calhoun asked finally . " My mother is fine . I 'm sure she hardly thinks of you at all . " " That 's ... good . " " How could you have done it ? " He was shaking his head in slow disbelief . " Xyon ... certainly you must know the circumstances of your conception ? " " I know , I know . Mother wanted to continue the family line , her late husband had been dead a year , and you , as Warlord of Xenex , in keeping with tradition , accommodated her by producing me . Hurray for you . Hurray for tradition . " " You do n't know ... you ca n't understand what it was like for me , Xyon . It was not something I desired to do . But I had my duty  --  to tradition , to your mother , and to my title as warlord . Frankly , it should have been my brother , since he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , it does n't matter . Because I also had a duty to myself . I was going to be leaving Xenex , attending Starfleet Academy . I could n't put that aside because of  --  " " Of a son . " " It was what your mother desired . She wanted to raise you on her own . She did n't want to hold me back . " " That may be what she told you , but it was n't what she desired . " " What do you mean ? " When Xyon did n't reply immediately , Calhoun repeated shortly , " What do you mean ? " " It does n't matter . " " Obviously , it does . To you . " Xyon looked at him levelly and said , " She always hoped you 'd come back some day . She could never ask you herself , tell you herself , because she did n't want to force you . But she hoped that someday ... you 'd return . Or send for us . " " I ... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Of course she never said . She felt it had to come from within you . " Xyon leaned back against a wall , hands draped over his legs . " She has too much pride . And optimism : She hoped , sooner or later , your thoughts of us would become so overwhelming that you 'd feel the need to return to her ... to me ... to us . " " That 's not how we left it between us , " said Calhoun tonelessly . " Things are never as we think they are . But I knew . I am your son , after all , " he said bitterly . " I know your mind as well as I know my own . My guess is , over the years , you never thought of us . Did you ? And the idea of returning , of being with her , with me ... you never considered that at all . Did you ? " " No , " was his soft reply . Then he looked over at Xyon with his hard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The answer is , no , I never considered coming back to stay with her , not really . I had my own life to lead . I thought she was living hers . " " You said I had no idea what it was like for you , " Xyon told him . " Well , you had even less what it was like for me . Living in the shadow of my father , the legend . The man who cared so much about his people that , by the time he was the age I am now , he had liberated an entire planet . Do you have any inkling what it was like ... knowing that you cared that much about Xenexians in general , " and he raised his hand , flat and horizontal , high above his head , " that you would do all that for them ... and that you cared for me so little , " and he placed his other hand just above the floor , to indicate the disparity in distance , " that you did n't come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I did come back ... once . And I tried to find Catrine ... but she had moved out of Calhoun . No one knew where she was . " " And you made oh-so-much endeavor to find her . Strain yourself mightily , did you ? Use all your resources ? Or was the challenge of finding one woman and one child on a small world too much for the redoubtable M'k'n'zy . " " I took her absence  --  her ' disappearance '  --  to mean that she did not want me as a part of her life , " Calhoun told him . " No . That was what you wanted to think . And what she knew you wanted . And deep down , you knew it , too . But pretending otherwise made it that much easier for you to go on with your life . " There was a long silence then . " So what have you been up to ? " Calhoun asked . It caught Xyon off guard . Still on the floor , he angled himself around to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " It 's a fairly straightforward question . What have you been up to ? When you 're not rescuing princesses . Or is that all you do ? " " Captain ... " Xyon felt as if he were back in the nebula . " Did n't you hear anything of what I said ? I do n't like you . You 're not someone I feel like discussing my life with . " " Yes , you 've made that clear . And if all you want to do is dwell on that which ca n't be changed , then that is entirely your privilege . But I can tell you that the ' legendary ' M'k'n'zy of Calhoun did n't help free his world from its oppressors by obsessing about what had been . Instead I thought only about what could , and would , be . If the only future you see for us is one of hostility , fine . We 've gotten along just fine without each other to this point , and we can continue to do so , I would imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it 's another to be a prisoner of it . " " Do you always speak in aphorisms ? " Xyon asked . " Depends on my mood . Aphorisms , riddles , rhyming couplets ... whatever strikes my fancy at any given moment . " He headed toward the door and did n't even bother to look over his shoulder as he said , " I 'm lifting your isolation to these quarters . Feel free to go where you choose , barring standard security protocols . Try not to slam anyone around . Oh , and you may want to tender an apology to Ensign Lefler ; you made quite a mess of her little gathering . " " You mean that 's it ? " demanded Xyon . " That 's all you have to say to me ? " This prompted Calhoun to turn and look questioningly at his son . " What else is there to say ? " " I do n't know . " " What ... " Calhoun actually looked astounded at the notion  --  " you 're not ... actually expecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you ? " " Of course not , " Xyon said stiffly . " Good . " Once more Calhoun started to leave , and suddenly Xyon said , " Did you love her ? " This time Calhoun did not turn quite as quickly . " You mean your mother ? " he asked . " Yes . Did you love her ? " " Xyon , " he said heavily , " you probably do n't know this ... but your mother was the first . " " The first woman you got pregnant ? " " No . The first woman . " " Oh . " Xyon cleared his throat uncomfortably . " I did n't ... uhm ... no . No , she never mentioned that . " " I love ... that she was good to me . That she did n't make me feel self-conscious . That she understood that there could never be anything between us other than that . I love those things about her . But I do n't love her . For the most part , I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ca n't love someone you do n't sufficiently know ; it 's just not possible . " " You know ... " Xyon said with a touch of defiance , " I bet you 've never ' known ' anyone enough to love them ... truly love them . Not ever . Because to get that close to them , you 'd have to let them get that close to you . And you never have . " Calhoun appeared to be considering the concept . After a long , thoughtful pause he said , " You know what ? You may very well be right . Then again , I should point out that , while you 're busy judging me ... I notice that you did n't feel compelled to remain on Xenex , with your mom , any more than I was . And I was about your age when I left . So before you 're too quick to judge me ... you may want to think about judging yourself . Enjoy the rest of your day , Xyon . " With that , he walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in his quarters .
