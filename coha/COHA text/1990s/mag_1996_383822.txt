Gas-fueled stoves are great-most of the time . They can be finicky and sometimes give out at the precise moment you need them most , like when you 're hungry as a bear at the end of a cold , rainy day . And every backcountry traveler seems to have a **40;213;TOOLONG story . At times like these , who has n't wondered if there 's a good alternative to gas ? Pyromid 's Pack-lite Plus is one . It 's a compact , folding stove that adds new meaning to the phrase " multifuel . " Do n't throw out your old gas stove yet , though , because the Pack-lite Plus is not for everybody , nor is it for all types of trips . Designed primarily to bum charcoal briquettes , the Pack-lite will also run on twigs or pine cones , and can be used as a windscreen for certain gasburning stoves that have detachable fuel tanks ( more on this below ) . This versatility makes the Pack-lite a good backup for times when your gas stove malfunctions or fuel runs low . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning renewable fuels instead of petrochemicals . The Pack-lite consists of a folding , square-shaped , stainless-steel windscreen with a grill on top . A steel " fuel grate " fits inside the windscreen and holds charcoal briquettes upright , so they 'll burn hotter than on your backyard grill . Lit with a chemically impregnated fire starter stick ( Pyromid provides a few with each stove but you can use any type of fire starter ) , the briquettes put out a steady supply of heat for 45 minutes to an hour . When the charcoal drops through the fuel grate slots , you keep the stove going by adding twigs or pine cones , or by lighting a few more briquettes . ( Do n't forget to pack out your ashes . ) The Pack-lite shines on short trips , where you have the luxury of being elaborate and using fresh foods that do n't require boiling water . For instance , while camped within eyeshot of half-frozen lakes in Colorado 's Indian Peaks , I feasted on grilled marinated chicken breasts-a treat that would have been hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next morning , I used the Pack-lite 's wide cooking surface to fry pancakes more evenly than I 've ever managed over a gas stove 's focused flame . It only took a few minutes before I noticed one of the stove 's other big benefits . While cooking , I could still hear the birds in the bushes around me . In fact , this stove will seem downright silent to those accustomed to the roar of a gas stove , or even to the crackle of an open fire . The Pack-lite , however , is not for hikers in a hurry . It takes 5 to 10 minutes to get the charcoal burning adequately , and then about 10 minutes to boil a cup of water in the shallow , square " pot " included with the stove . Despite many tries , I never managed a rolling boil with a quart of water , though I reached a slow boil in about half an hour . Burning twigs and pine cones , I finally got the water to boil after 30 minutes of steadily feeding fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll be frustrated if you plan to cook pasta for a group . And you can forget about this stove for winter use , because it just does n't get hot enough for prolonged snow melting and coldweather cooking . For those who only need to heat a cup or two of water for drinks , or folks who rely exclusively on freeze-dried meals , the Pack-lite Plus could be adequate as a primary stove . But most backpackers would only carry it as a wood- or charcoal-burning backup for simmering soup or sauteing side dishes , while still relying on a gas stove for the main course . If you do carry the Pack-lite as a backup , you can use it as a windscreen for some gas stoves that have removable legs . It worked fine with the Safesport Spider stove Pyromid sent me . Pyromid also touts that it works easily with the MSR Rapidfire , but you have to first take the legs off the stove to make it fit inside the windscreen box . The Pack-lite will not work with any stove that has attached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stove or a Peak 1 Feather 442 . Using it as a windscreen for the Safesport stove , I boiled a quart in about 8 minutes , which is 2 minutes faster than without the Pack-lite windscreen . A few other considerations : Although charcoal is easy and light to carry in a zipped plastic bag ( you need four to six briquettes per meal ) , I found it impossible to set up the stove without smudging soot all over my hands and clothes . Also , the openflamed Pack-lite is illegal in some firerestricted areas . A ranger told me it would be allowable in the stove-only areas of the Indian Peaks Wilderness Area , but neighboring Rocky Mountain National Park said " no dice " to burning wood or charcoal in the backcountry . The Pack-lite comes with a nonfunctional mess kit that is n't worth its weight in your pack . It consists of a square , shallow pot that holds only 3 cups of water and is hard to clean because of the sharp edges and corners , a lid that doubles as a small plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mess kit and folding base plate at home cuts the weight of the package from 40 ounces down to an admirable 18 . For these reasons , and because it bumps up the price tag to a rather hefty $69.95 , Pyromid would be better off selling the mess kit as an optional accessory . <p>
