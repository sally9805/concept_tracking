VARSITY TEAMS : 38 INTRAMURAL SPORTS : 38 FAMOUS ALUMNI : BILL BRADLEY , DICK KAZMEIER , GEOFF PETRIE EXTRA CREDIT FOR : SUCCEEDING WITHOUT ATHLETIC SCHOLARSHIPS // Sitting in a 240-year-old building , in the shadow of an almost century-old painting , Princeton president Harold Shapiro has just heard some intriguing news . His institution , the one with the $30,000-a-year price tag and no athletic scholarships , has been named the 10th-best jock school in the country . // Come again ? At Princeton , which guards its academic reputation like a birthright , this is cause for ... what ? Pride ? Angst ? Certainly the man in the painting , former school president Woodrow Wilson , is n't smiling . And for a second , you wonder if the building  --  Nassau Hall , which once withstood shelling by the British  --  might come crashing down around him . // Thankfully it does n't . " I 'm surprised since that is n't what jumps to people 's minds when they think of Princeton , " says Shapiro . " But we 've always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , so I 'm glad . " His teams are worth the price of admission . Last year the Tigers won three national championships ( in men 's lacrosse , men 's heavyweight crew and men 's lightweight crew ) , and those did n't include the second straight national title won by the women 's rugby club , which has a 59-match winning streak . Meanwhile , the softball team won 37 games in a row last season en route to its second straight College World Series appearance , and the men 's basketball team , wielder of the sport 's most famous slingshot , has been to the NCAA tournament six times in the last nine years . // Princeton dominated the Ivy League in 1995-96 like no school before , winning 11 conference titles . This year four Tigers teams have already won Ivy championships , including the field hockey team , which made a surprise run to the NCAA title game . Certain to add to the list of conference championships is the undefeated men 's lacrosse squad , which has been ranked No. 1 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth NCAA title in six years . // Behind the success is athletic director Gary Walters , a former Tigers basketball player who appeared on a 1967 SI cover under the slightly overheated headline PRINCETON BUILDS A BASKETBALL DYNASTY . Since taking over in 1994 , Walters , one of the few ADs who can get away with using the terms agonistes and bte noir in consecutive sentences , has raised not just the number of varsity teams ( there will be 38 next year , second in the country only to Harvard 's 41 ) , but also shiny new facilities . The building boom has included a $3.5 million stadium for lacrosse and field hockey and a $2.5 million renovation of the school 's 10 varsity squash courts . In the coming year workmen will erect a $9 million women 's locker room and the crown jewel , a $45 million replacement for Palmer Stadium , which until its recent demolition was the nation 's second-oldest football stadium . // It all amounts to a big sports commitment by a small school , and not just to its varsity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a thousand participants competed in Princeton 's 34 club sports , which include cricket and ballroom dancing . Students with a jones for nature can go indoors ( on the 26-foot climbing wall ) or outdoors ( on hiking and canoeing excursions throughout the Northeast ) . As for more traditional athletic pursuits , Princeton 's intramurals attract more than 600 teams . The country 's oldest intramural event , an 18-sport **26;176;TOOLONG fest called Cane Spree , has kicked off every school year since 1869. // Princeton 's most notorious athletic tradition is maintained at midnight after the season 's first snowfall , when as many as four hundred sophomores run au naturel around the Holder Hall courtyard in a coed frolic known as the Nude Olympics . In recent years , so many spectators ( and tabloid camera crews ) came to see just how well-rounded Princeton students were that admission for this year 's Olympics was restricted to those with student I.D . ' s. // Alas , all the sports talk and championships have elicited a serious case of faculty hand-wringing . Admits Walters , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Internally we worry about that success . " He should n't worry too much . After all , Nassau Hall is n't slated to be razed for a football practice field , at least not yet .
