<p> In 1957 , I was a painter , interested in the picturesque ruins of Greece 's temples and noble statues . I was just beginning to learn about food , but had no suspicion that cooking and the food of the Mediterranean would soon become a major focus in my life . <p> Rather than looking for specific recipes , I enjoyed other interests : the tastes and smells of Greek food ; the colors at the markets ; the energy of people as they dined and drank in tavernas . <p> I was more interested in the blues of the sky and sea , the whiteness of the architecture , the glow of a copper pan of stuffed tomatoes glistening with olive oil than in the cooking . <p> Then I moved to Italy and lived for a time on a student 's budget in an apartment without a refrigerator , I realized that I had to learn to take those tastes and smells of the Mediterranean , those fabulous products found at the markets and . . . cook . <p> Soon my passion for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every time I tasted a new dish , I asked how it was prepared . I tried familiar favorites over and over at different restaurants and trattorias to compare variations and styles of preparation . <p> Recently , I returned to Greece after a lapse of more than 30 years to attend a conference focusing on Greek food and wine . I was no longer a culinary novice and had lots of cooking experience under my belt and around my hips . I now tasted Greek food and wine with a different perspective , that of a chef . <p> The yogurt was still as remarkable as I remembered . I savored the pungency of wild thyme and oregano rubbed on grilled fish and souvlaki sold at street stalls , the honey , the dried figs with bay leaves and sesame seeds , the flavorful tomatoes and cucumbers , the olive oil , the cheeses . How could I use these tastes ? <p> I realized that I 'd tasted similar dishes in southern Italy , which was once known as Magna Graecia . After all , that 's where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poseidonia after the Greek god of the sea , in the Sicilian cities of Syracuse , Agrigento and Segesta . And such whitewashed cities as Ostuni in Apulia that looked strikingly like Mykonos and Santorini . <p> If there were Greek influences in Italian art and architecture , of course there would be Greek influences in the food . <p> Some of the earliest grape varietals planted on Italian soil were Greek in origin , like the famed aglianico , whose name is derived from ellenico , meaning Greek . The word pitta , used in Greece for a savory pie , is a term still used for pizza in the Calabrian dialect . <p> In the province of Basilicata ( from the Greek word basilikos ) , they still prepare a sausage named lucanica , seasoned with hot pepper and fennel seeds and ginger , instead of coriander , allspice and orange zest used in the Greek sausage called loukanika . <p> The traditional Greek puree of fava beans with greens appears as capriata in Apulia , where grilled bread is spread with bean puree topped with greens ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sicily and Calabria . <p> Which is why the recipes that I have selected below have two lives . They are Greek , but versions of these recipes are also cooked in Italy . I hope you will enjoy them with a glass of Greek or Italian wine . <p> Skordalia , the garlic-perfumed puree of potatoes that accompanies fish and shellfish in Greece , becomes scurdalia in Sicily and salsa del oblio ( the forgotten sauce ) in Spain . In addition to the garlic and almonds , poppy seeds and a dash of hot pepper are added . <p> Skordalia can be made with bread crumbs , nuts and olive oil , but I like the version made with potatoes best . You may add either toasted almonds , toasted walnuts or the tang of Kalamata olives to this rich and garlicky puree . Instead of lemon juice , you may use vinegar for a slightly sharper taste . Serve with cooked prawns or scallops , steamed or fried . A crisp white wine from Italy or Greece will cut the richness of the puree and slice through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may bake the potatoes or boil them . Just be sure to rice them or mash with a potato masher . <p> Mussels , called cozze in most of Italy , are called mitili in the Apulian Greek city of Taranto , a term not too distant from the Greek mythia . Try the mussel stew with a young , crisp , fruity white wine , such as Boutari Santorini or Chateau Carras . A fruity red wine with low tannins , such as Achaia Clauss Nemea , will also work well if slightly chilled . <p> Grilling fish is one of the most popular methods of Mediterranean fish cookery . It seems only natural that in countries where grapes are grown , vine leaves are used to wrap food going on the grill . Not only do they impart a certain smoky flavor , but they protect delicate fish from breaking . Fresh grape leaves are seasonal and hard to find , but those that come packed in jars work very well . Just rinse them of all brine , pat dry and remove any tough stems . ( If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in boiling water for 3 to 4 minutes to soften . ) <p> In Greece , small fish such as sardines and red mullet are gutted , scaled and grilled whole . Boneless fillets are especially flavorful when wrapped in leaves . If you do n't feel like grilling or lighting the broiler , bake vine-leaf-wrapped fish in a preheated 450-degree oven for about 8 minutes . <p> If you stick to the simplest version of this dish , crisp dry white wines , such as Tocal Friulano , Vernaccia di San Gimignano or Greco di Tufo , will work well , as would a Santorini or Kretikos . If using Kalamata olives , a young Nemea might be better .

Add garlic to potatoes and mix well . Beat in lemon juice and olive oil , mashing together until finely pureed .
