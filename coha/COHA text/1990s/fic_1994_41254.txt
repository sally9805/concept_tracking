I thought I 'd suffocate in the nylon folds of her housedress when she caught me by the elbows and hugged me close . My forehead sank into her collarbone , her breasts pillowed my chest , her sweat , sour as grapefruit , seeped into my clothes . I had never been that close to a woman that large  --  a stranger , too  --  and her affection , her overwhelming ripeness , alarmed me . <p> She kissed me somewhere along my jawline , then held me away to stare at me much too fondly before clasping both hands behind my neck . " My new daughter , " she said in patois-distorted English . " Children , come meet your future sister-in-law ! " <p> They scurried into the hallway like little animals , with their faces shiny from Vaseline and their skinny arms and legs like sticks under their T-shirts and shorts . The smaller ones ' shirts were filthy and sticky from cane juice , mangoes , whatever they ate , and I pitied them immediately . Shame , I thought , shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . Damned if any man will knock me up when I 'm past 40 . I was 26 . <p> " Not all of them is mine , " my future mother-in-law said , and I jumped deep in my bones , afraid she had read my mind . " The two boys is my grandchildren from Josette , you know , Claude 's big sister . Then that naughty child there is my one little great-niece , Vena , she 's 4 . And the other three ? All mine , praise God and keep us . They 're 9 , 11 and 13 , Claude 's little half-sisters , Lord bless him . Where is that boy ? " <p> I explained that he had returned to the car to get our luggage and turned away from her to face the front door expectantly . I figured he 'd come puffing through it soon  --  all eager to impress his family . He 'd been able to visit them only four times in the 14 years since he 'd left the island to go to high school in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for him , and I felt another sweltering blast from their sun , which really did glow yellow in the day and russet at night and would sit in your hand if you reached out skyward . Claude had his back to the sky . I could see his white shirt hunched over the car trunk and above him the corrugated metal roofs glinting like slate on the white-stone houses and the palm trees swaying as if we were in some paradise , which we were n't , only Antigua . <p> " Come , come now ! " Abandoning the door , Mums clasped my elbow again as though it belonged to her . " Come to the kitchen , Valry . That way I can start dinner while we talk . I got the special dish for you today girl : a nice , plump , fresh agouti . " <p> We were barely in the kitchen when the front door slammed ( that seemed to be the only way to close it ) and I found myself directing prayers toward the noise : Claude , at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any footsteps , just his baritone laughter amid delighted hoots and screams  --  those children turned to hooligans beneath his tickling fingers . <p> " He 'll come to you soon , " Mums said , telepathic again , and looked indulgent and very at home in the tangerine-walled kitchen . There was newspaper on the floor to sop up some recent spillage and unnaturally large vegetation on the Formica table : yellow yams , roasted breadfruit , green bananas , a bowl full of grated cassava . <p> " Bring me that dish , please , " she said , and I obediently reached for the cassava , dusting a giant ant off the rim of the bowl before carrying it toward her . <p> " Claude told me your folks is from Jamaica , " she said , " You ever lived there ? " <p> " No , my parents emigrated to the States long before I was born . But I did go to Jamaica for a vacation once when I was 19 . " I had intended to place the bowl gently on the draining board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it was cracked after that . I heaved mvself backward and waved a finger at the sink cavity . " What , what is that ? " <p> Curled up in the sink was an animal , dead , it seemed , but with everything intact : the long , narrow head with a little mean expression still on it and the four claws stiff and tucked neatly toward the rear . It had some kind of grisly fur too , bristly beige hairs all over the body except for the tail . Not a hair on that tail , which was at least two feet long and whipped over the edge of the sink like a wiry piece of rope . I would have called it a rat , except that it was too big . It filled the sink , and its mean black eyes stared back at me as if it could still bite . <p> Claude strode into the kitchen and immediately embraced his mother , who started to cry as uncontrollably as she had when he first greeted her , before he went out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't seen him since he had come home for his stepfather 's funeral three years ago . <p> " Claudie , " she wailed , " Claudie , my big son , " and her leg-o ' - mutton arms locked him in a hug . They stood immobilized in that position for ages until Mums disengaged one arm to beckon me into the embrace : " Valry ! " I walked reluctantly toward them and asked what was on my mind : " Theres an animal , dead , in your sink . What is it ? " " Oh , that 's our agouti . " <p> I barely managed to swallow my alarm . " Really . What is agouti ? " " <p> She hugged me fondly . " Agouti is agouti " she said , " You never seen agouti before ? " <p> Claude began to chuckle . " Unlikely , " he said and quickly began to update his mother on his life and mine . As a defense attorney he had perfected the art of manipulating conversations , and he applied his courtroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than " Uh huh " and " Yes , very nice . " I waited several minutes for a lapse in the discussion , at which point I cleared my throat loudly and pointed to the sink . <p> " Mmm , agouti , " Claude said quickly , and tried to frown down my sour expression . " Sweetheart , let 's go to our room and unpack  --  leave Mums to work her kitchen magic . " And he gave her bottom a good , hard pinch before pulling me out the door . <p> I rediscovered my voice as soon as we got upstairs : " That thing 's not coming near my plate ! " <p> " I do n't jwant to argue , but I 'll tell you this : We 're going to eat it , Valerie . You and me both . " <p> His decisveness surprised me . " Why ? " <p> " It 's my family 's gift , and it 's more than they can afford to offer right now . " <p> " Well I 'm sorry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! " <p> " Do you know how much one agouti costs ? " he asked , and when I shrugged , he walked to the bed and stood over me . " I do n't ant my mother to think we 've come all the way here and she was n't able to give us anything . " <p> " But I do n't expect anything , " I said . <p> " That 's not the point , and yes , you do . You expect it to be okay when you place yourself above your own people . " <p> We 'd been through this before except he usually played the role of commiserator , the one who understood me because he knew firsthand how hard it could be to get by in American society with the trappings of a Third World culture on your back . I was n't raised in the Caribbean the way he was , so I just identify with the islanders . <p> " I 'm my own person . Is n't that my prerogative , Claude ? " I asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not . Not when you 're with my family . " <p> I crossed my arms and considered this new kink in his reasoning . " But you can deal with it when I 'm not with your family " <p> ' I 'm marrying you , are n't I ? " He grabbed a towel from a nearby chair . " Look , Valerie . I figure you 'll deal with your prejudices when you 're ready , and that 's fine . But while you 're here , you 've got to show my family respect . " <p> Claude went into the washroom . I into the enamel basin and wondered whether I would be able to wash myself in the cold water for his sake , whether I could eat bami that had already been sampled by ants , whether my disdain for island dress , speech , food and manners was apparent to his mother , whether Claude would ever forgive me if I shamed him before his family . <p> The smell of something burning began to fill the bedroom , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared yard area . Two empty chicken coops were stacked to one side between some tall , stringy gunga-pea bushes and a stout guava tree spotted with creamy blossoms . There was no grass to speak of , and what there was was sunburnt into the dust and right now hosted a little stick fire that Mums was tending to while the children played tag barefoot . <p> I could hear Cluade breathing me in the bedroom doorway , not moving , probably staring at me , maybe wondering whether we needed to continue the argument . <p> " Claude , " I said , " your mother has a fire going . Is there going to be a barbecue ? " <p> " Not exactly . " He seemed to hesitate . " They 're burning the hair off the agouti . " <p> " Why ? " <p> " So it will be ready for stewing . " <p> I pressed my cheek against the window frame , amazed I had n't noticed the long , brown mass in the middle of the flames . Each time Mums poked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and the long head snapped back and forth into obscenely contorted positions made possible by the way its throat had been cut . And I noticed the smell again , different now that I knew what it was , more pungent  --  more pungent , and fetid enough to unsettle my lunch . <p> This was the second time I had felt suffocated during the trip . I asked Claude to take me outdoors for a walk while Mums finished preparing the meal . <p> " You could offer to help her , " he said . <p> " Tomorrow , " I promised , and he did n't press me . <p> As we passed the kitchen , I tried not to notice the enormous black pot boiling ominously . I hurried ahead to the front door , but Claude dallied behind to tease his sisters and talk with his mother . He kept me waiting for about ten minutes , and I was astonished at how humble I felt , like an outcast , standing alone . <p> Claude jokingly boasted he 'd teach me Antigua 's most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeded to do so . He told me how to ensure that ackee is n't poisonous before picking it from the tree , how to roast jackfruit seeds and score the skin of the fruit so it wo n't explode on the fire , how to put a leash on a crab I want to become my pet , how to fatten agouti for slaughter by feeding it ripe bananas , how to turn soursop pulp into a tasty drink , how to extract powder from cassava water and use it to starch clothes . He seemed intent on making each task sound magical  --  as if he believed his words would charm me . <p> " If you want to control an agouti , just grab it by the tail . <p> It ca n't turn back on itself to bite you , because its spine is so long and stiff . As long as you keep a hold on that tail , you have a slave in your hands . " <p> I made a lame and belated peace offering : " How much did they pay for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earns about twice that in a week . " <p> " That 's a lot of money then . " <p> He sat beside me on a splintered bench and cupped my knee with one hand . " Yes , although we agreed that 's not the real issue . " <p> " Respect , " I said . <p> He amended : " Consideration . " <p> " Have I really been so rude ? " <p> He kissed my cheek . " Do n't fret . A little more warmth in your smile , a good meal in your belly , and we 'll be all set . " <p> " I did n't agree to eat it . " I said . " There are lots of other ways to show good will . " <p> " Sure . " <p> " Did your mother say something about my attitude ? " <p> " Its okay . I told her you were nervous . " <p> Claude said a dutiful grace from the head of the table , while I watched from the oposite end between Mums and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms started colliding across the table as they reached for the white serving dishes filled with rice and peas , green bananas , breadfruit and yams , a bowl piled up with spinachlike callaloo . The only plate they did n't touch was the one I dreaded , the one that Mums guarded : a platter of steaklike meat , smothered in steaming onions and carrots and a spicy gravy . I tried to protect my plate with my hand when Mums threatened me with a heaping serving-spoonful of stew . " Just a little for me , thanks , " I said , adding the polite lie : " I usually do n't eat meat . " <p> " No ? " she said but thankfully emptied only half of the monster spoonful onto my plate before giving the remainder to Doris . I noticed Claude watching me from the other end of the table and was glad when Gladys and Saralyn , the 11-and 13-year-olds , asked him to settle an argument they were having . <p> The breadfruit was delicious , firm and nutty , and I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were beginning to look lonely on my plate . No one remarked upon the unevenness of my appetite , but evenually Vena reached over to my plate and pointed to the slew with one finger , looking up at me . <p> Mums slapped her hand . " Do n't point in people 's food , " she said and returned her attention to her own plate . " Valry do n't eat much meat . " I felt ashamed . <p> My share of the agouti was fleshy and boneless , but the girls ' portions were webbed with dozens of tiny revolting ribs that suggested something ominous about agouti physiology . I resolutely speared a lean piece and put it in my mouth . The meat was soft as bread but had a rank , muttonish flavor that the savory spices could n't quite disinfect . I did n't like it . Even if it had tasted great , I could n't have liked it  --  the cooked flesh of a rodent , and it was in my mouth . Peeking up from my plate I saw Claude had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . The only person not paying attention was Mums . <p> I leaned toward her . " Mums , " I said , but I was unintelligible . My mouth was still full , the gravy diluted by warm saliva I could not swallow . <p> " What 's the matter , child " <p> I pressed my hands to my lips and stared miserably at the tablecloth while the meat turned trashy on my tongue . <p> " Are you sick ? " <p> I swallowed enough of the juice to permit a full confession , which I whispered into my plate : " I ca n't eat the agouti . " <p> She looked at my miserable face , one cheek bulging and crescents of water pooling in my eyes , before looking over at her fuming son . <p> " What you staring at , Claude ? " she sked , startling him before turning to me and holding a tissue to my mouth . " Spit " she said , and I did . <p> " Better now ? " <p> " Yes . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mortified by how easily she had settled my dilemma . <p> She waved everyone back to their meals , and when they were eating again tapped me on the wrist . " Why you eat it if you do n't like it ? " <p> I felt too humiliated to speak , but it did n't matter , because she was looking at her son . <p> " I thought American girls could hold their own against men . You got to handle him better than that , " she said . " Lord , Jesus ! " she added and started to laugh . <p> Brenda Williams is a freelance writer who lives in Brooklyn . <p>
