We see the media stories all the time : child care is bad for children , especially infants ; mothers in the paid workforce do n't participate in their communities ; employed mothers " know " they should be home with their children but ca n't afford to be . No matter how the story is told , it always comes down to one thing : guilt . Even though 72 percent of all mothers are in the paid workforce , as far as the media and many researchers are concerned , working mothers can never do it right . We decided to get some straight answers from Betty Holcomb , senior articles editor of Working Mother magazine . Her new book , Not Guilty ! The Good News About Working Mothers ( Scribner ) , examines why working mothers are made to feel guilty about their children , and why they do n't need to . D.J. : Why do you think working mothers feel so guilty much of the time ? Where does it come from ? B.H. : Soon after my daughter , Rachel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I wrote a magazine story on the debate over infant care , while I was struggling with my own issues about putting her in child care . I had found a wonderful place-it had been cited as a national model for child care and learning development . But for many people , including me , it 's painful to separate from your infant . I just wanted to be with my daughter . But I also enjoyed my work , and I was looking for some kind of balance . Our child care center showed me that it was possible for me to have her in an environment that I was comfortable with . But people kept saying to me , " Ca n't you have someone come to your home ? " implying that because I worked at home , I should still be with her , and implying that I needed to be with her all the time . As I continued to write about these issues , I heard from women all over the country . I remember one mother called me crying . " I carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she sobbed . She was so worried that her son was going to be irrevocably damaged by child care . A lot of women think managing child care and work is their personal problem . They do n't see the patterns and understand the forces that are driving their choices . It 's such a deeply personal passage to be a parent and to make choices about how your children are going to be cared for , how you 're going to organize your family life . Women rarely identify where their guilt is coming from , because it 's so ingrained in the culture . But basically , we 're operating with very old stereotypes of what a good mother is . Early studies of child care compared day care to orphanages and equated a mother 's working with her total absence , as if a mother was never there for her child if she went out to a job . That idea is still part of the underpinning of how we talk about work and child care . Even though we should n't feel guilty about working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to balance a job and family . It is hard to leave your kids some days . Especially when they are babies , the newness is so delicious and wonderful . All that early research speaks to the strong and fierce love that most women have for their children . But the research never says , but you 're still there , you 're part of their lives nearly every day , you 're a constant presence in your child 's life . Women have always worked outside the home , and their kids have turned out fine . So the ideology about the mother-child relationship has derailed sensible talk about how we raise our children . D. J. : But has n't the research gotten more sophisticated about the relation between mothers and children ? B.H. : In some ways it has , but there 's an even more virulent strain of mother  --  bashing going on now . Raising a child has become a demanding and focused art : we know so much about child development that women are made to feel guilty if they do n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or if they do n't talk to them enough . Suddenly we learn their brains wo n't grow property , as if their brains would n't grow without this intense , focused intervention . The new mystique is that you 're totally responsible for your child 's mental development . While I was writing this book I spoke to one woman who was deeply worried  --  she 'd read an article in the Wall Street Journal that said day care centers were meat factories , and the new status symbol of the 1990s was the stay-at-home mother . You read this stuff and it hits you . Even though we know in our hearts that much of this is not true , when you 're so fiercely attached to your child , you 're insecure , you 're vulnerable , and there 's always a doubt that maybe these experts are right and you should be home improving your infant 's brain development . Until the late 1980s there was practically no research on fathers . It really took the feminist movement and progressive men to bring them into the picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all about mothers , because we 've assigned these roles by gender . These ideas are embedded in our institutions and in the structures of our lives . By these standards , if you 're trying to be a good employee , it can be almost impossible to be a good mother . If your child is sick and you want to take time off , you 're not a good employee . If you do n't take time off , you 're not a good mother . The power of gender ideology operates on a deep level . Many people still believe that what it means to be feminine is what it means to be a good mother : nurturing , caring , good at relationships . But women are expanding the options of what we can be . When Working Mother did a survey in 1997 , 65 percent of the respondents said they were ambitious , and 27 percent said they were very ambitious . And they all felt they could be good mothers too . D.J. : And does n't the research indicate that they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies indicate that companies benefit when they acknowledge that women can be good workers and good parents . And they suffer when they do n't . One bank in Florida had offered its employees flextime . Suddenly it decided to stop offering " special " consideration to parents-who were , of course , mostly women . The bank started having problems with overseas accounts and when bank officials looked-which they should have done before they cut the benefit-they found that some of the women working flextime were at the bank at hours that made it possible to talk to overseas clients . D.J. : You mention in the book that some discrimination hits even before women become pregnant . And that some companies continue to discriminate against working mothers even though it 's illegal . B.H. : It 's not that women have n't made progress . But there still is this mystique that it 's much better to be home , which makes it harder for women who work outside the home . Yes , there are laws that give people protection , whether it 's the right to pregnancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful about what they say , but I think the discrimination is actually pretty blatant . Employers still anticipate that a young woman will have children , and they take that into account when they decide whether to mentor her or groom her for top positions . And should she announce that she 's pregnant , often her responsibilities change , and it 's assumed that she wo n't be as committed . The Bank of Montreal did a study in which managers were asked about promotions . The main reason cited for women 's lack of representation in the upper ranks was that women have babies . But when the study looked at women 's records versus men 's , it found that women were more attached to the company , generally had stayed over longer periods of time , and generally had better performance reviews than the men . So there was no legitimate reason not to promote them ; it was just the power of belief about what women would do that tainted their prospects in the workplace . At th upper levels , there are few women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affecting the hiring guidelines . In some industries , it 's egregious . On Wall Street , women brokers have been told flat out , " You did n't get a bonus this year because you took six weeks off for childbirth . " The women know that 's illegal , but they do n't challenge it because the industry is small , and they 're afraid they might get blackballed if they make a fuss and then try to move to another company . When you look at other traditionally male jobs , like sales , similar things happen . Women do n't speak up because there are n't enough of them there , they know winning a lawsuit could take years , and they may not be able to prove their case . It 's often their word against their managers ' . Some studies on flextime show that workers using it are making 10 percent less than other workers , even though they 're still doing their full job . Some women are so grateful for the flextime they do n't say anything . This is still defined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way we work . D.J. : What do you offer as solutions ? B.H. : I think we all have to start talking to come up with solutions . I want to spark a debate because the system we have does n't work . It has nothing to do with the real lives or aspirations of people , and it does harmful , horrible things to families . At Working Mother we heard about parents in Boston who were leaving their five-year-old kids in the streets alone to catch the school bus , because the parents did n't want to be late for work and be docked pay or lose their jobs . We 've started on some solutions , but they offer so little . The Family and Medical Leave Act was a watershed in some ways . It 's the first federal parental leave law we have that includes both genders . According to some people who worked on FMLA , the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the business interests would have preferred that it applied to women only ; they did n't want to spread the benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people do n't take childbirth leave much because it 's unpaid . The men get nothing and the women may get some money from their medical disability plan , because pregnancy is seen as a health condition . How many families can afford to take unpaid leave ? In other countries , they have things like family allowances . In some European countries you can get three fourths of your pay the first year after your baby is born and free health care . But in the U.S. , even the new debates are about the same old stuff . Conservatives in Congress are saying , " Let 's have a tax credit for women to stay home . " They are talking a tax credit of $500 a year for families making $70,000 a year . Well , who 's going to be able to stay home for $500 even if they wanted to be home ? There are many solutions to look at . We should address the prejudices that arise from stereotypes . But we also need to change the way we think about the nature of work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for child care means you 're not ambitious . We need to rethink the hours we work . Maybe it means hiring more workers . In Germany , they have job sharing where three or more people do one job rather than just two people . We need to expand the Family and Medical Leave Act so that it covers all workers , not just the 58 percent it covers now . And we need paid family leave for everybody , women and men . We need to march on Congress with our children , and say to those men there , " You try to work and raise children at the same time . " We should have a strike of working mothers and see if companies can function if women are n't there doing the work . There is safety in numbers . That 's what feminism found out . If one woman goes to her employer and asks for something , she can either be rewarded as a great valuable worker and become the exception to the rule , or she can be torpedoed and become very vulnerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get together and begin to talk about this and get some men with them too , they can make change . Remaining silent , continuing to try and live by the rules , does n't work in the long run . We live in a system that is invested in this fantasy that families can function this way . It 's a fantasy to think that the workplace is functioning as well as it can . DeLora Jones is a freelance writer based in New York City . <p>
