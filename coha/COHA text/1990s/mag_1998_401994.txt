Beware of these five tainted personality types . Here 's your waste-removal plan for eliminating these lethal losers from your life . // * They 're friends , family , coworkers , and nothing makes them happier than making you miserable . Whether it 's the officemate who disses your ideas in front of the big boss , the friend who cats up your time with her unending tales of woe , or the neighbor who tells you she loves your new haircut  --  just like the one she had in 1994-they suck the energy out of you and infuse you with grief . Avoid them ? If only you could . Too often , the most toxic people are the ones closest to you-relatives , friends , and coworkers you just ca n't get away from . But if you ca n't avoid their attacks , you can learn to deal with their draining ways . " You ca n't change them , " says Lillian Glass , Ph.D. , author of Toxic People : 10 Ways of Dealing With People Who Make Your Life Miserable ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can change how you react to them , which will help you feel better . " Here , learn how getting inside the minds of these toxic types can stop them from tainting your life . TOXIC TYPE 1 The Tragically Hip Warning signs : These all-in-black , dressed  --  to-depress types are the poster children for misery chiic . They 're obsessed with their " miserable " existence-even when there really is n't anything in their lives worthy of such melodramatic moping . You find yourself intentionally trying not to have too much fun in front of them because they act as though happiness just is n't cool . Biting sarcasm is this type 's native tongue  --  that is , when they are n't chain-smoking , pouting , or looking oh so deep . Lethal line : " I worked with a publicist who went to every hip party in New York City and spent her time around celebrities . But all she did was complain about how boring it was , " says Beth MacDonald , a 25  --  year-old copywriter from New Jersey . " Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had been invited to a movie premiere , and she shot me a snotty look and said , Oh yeah , like that ' s goiing to be a lot of fun . ' It was as though there was something wrong with my being excited about something . Her comment immediately put a damper on my day . " Detox strategy : Do n't get sucked into another person , , depression spiral . " People who choose misery as a lifestyle are obviously getting something out of it  --  sympathy , a deep image , or attention , " says Mark Rosen , Ph.D. , author of Thank You for Being Such a Pain : Spiritual Guidance for Dealing With Difficult People ( Harmony Books , 1998 ) . So before they bum you out , realize these miserable people really would like to find happiness-they 're just not gutsy enough to go after it . " They 're strangely superstitious about happiness , " says Glass . " They 're convinced that the moment they admit to it , something bad will happen and they 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down people who are basically happy ; they ca n't stand that somebody else has something they want . If they can make you miserable too , at least they wo n't feel like such losers . Just because they want to believe the world 's glass is half empty does n't mean that you have to also . " Pessimism is extremely contagious , " says Glass . " If you ca n't avoid them , counterbalance their gloom and doom with an upbeat , high-energy attitude . " You do n't have to generate obnoxious artificial sunshine . Just do n't hold back your all-natural enthusiasm when they 're around . Do n't wallow in their sarcasm-bask in their envy . TOxiC TYPE 2 The Put-Down Artist Photograph Poison posse : Is there something about them that drives you crazy ? // Warning signs : No one is safe from their rude , insensitive , and sometimes shocking comments . They go out of their way to not-so-subtly cut you down to microscopic size because that 's the only way they can feel bigger and better about themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use it to cut down what you wear , where you socialize , the people you hang out with-anything that does not meet their been-there-done-that standards . Around them , you feel like a gawky middle-schooler trying desperately to fit in with the cool crowd-and failing . Lethal line : " There was a guy I always ran into at frat parties . I did n't like him because he thought he was too cool and always made fun of people , " says Candace Williams , 22 , a student in Virginia . " One night , I was at a party and some friends and I were planning to go to a club afterward . We mentioned it to him , and he said , ' Yeah , but you guys probably wo n't be able to get in . ' It was as though he had to prove he was cooler than me by putting down my plans and hinting that I was n't attractive . " Detox strategy : " The need to put others down clearly reflects a low self-esteem , " says Rosen . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel better is by making others feel worse . " Realizing that helped Williams deal with the frat jerk . " Whenever he crossed my path , I reminded myself just how pathetic it was that he had to be cruel to feel cool , " she says . " I just ignored him . That took his power away , and his put-downs lost their impact . " Williams was smart just to walk away . When you 're dealing with a master disser , the last thing you want him to do is retaliate and pull out the heavy-insult artillery . So the next time you 're hit by the unsolicited bigmouthed opinion of a Put-Down Artist , thank him or her for the opinion and move on . Do that each time you are put down . Eventually , you 'll establish a rep for being a tough mark and he 'll stop . It 's no fun if he does n't get a rise out of you . TOXIC TYPE 3 The Misery Monster Warning signs : They 'd have to do some climbing before they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But unlike the Tragically Hip , they 're not getting perverse pleasure from their pain . They 're just needy cling-ons who always expect you to solve their problems-without so much as asking you how your day went . They convince you that you 're their only outlet and without your help they 'd surely go wacko-or worse . You do n't want to be held responsible for their self-destruction , so you let them corner you at inconvenient times , tie up your telephone line , and guilt you into listening to the latest chapter in their never-ending tale of woe . While their truma-queen tales can be entertaining , they definitely do n't know how to be a true friend . Because they 're so obsessed with themselves , they wo n't ever be there for you in a clinch . Lethal line : " I had a friend in college who went from one disaster to another , dragging me along for the ride . But whenever I had so much as a bad days she blew me off , " recalls Helen Caine , 32 , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged , she really lost it and told me , If did't have you to talk to , I 'd kill myself ' She was way too dependent on me , but I did n't know how to bag out . " Detox strategy : If you 're close to this person , do n't just blow off her pitiful POV Assess the depths of her depression . " It 's possible that the problem is biochemical and she 's clinically depressed , " says Rosen . " If you think it 's serious , you should encourage her to work out her problems with a professional . " But if you do n't think she 's seriously depressed or in need of professional counseling , do some headshrinking of your own . You 've probably been tricked into believing that these types think too little of themselves . But on closer examination , you 'll realize it 's just the opposite . These woe-is  --  me mopers are completely self-obsessed , and they have no idea just how abusive they 're being . " The whole world is about them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how they 're affecting you , " says Glass . " So the next time they begin a melancholy monologue , do n't turn it into a dialogue . Be silent and see how they enjoy talking to themselves . " If they ask you why you are n't saying anything , take a deep breath and reply , " Well , I was waiting for you to ask how I 'm doing for a change . " If that does n't get your point across , perhaps a more blunt approach will . Tell your Misery Monster that if she wants you to be her shrink , you 'll have to start charging $100 an hour . Hopefully , she 'll realize how self-centered she 's being and lay off the I'm-a-loser bit . Or she might freak out and never to speak to you again  --  which is what you wanted all along . TOXIC TYPE 4 The Prosecutor Warning signs : These verbal-assault artists intentionally knock you off-balance with direct , off-putting comments and questions-especially in front of authority figures . Unlike the Put-Down Artist , they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch you off-guard , so you turn into a blathering idiot , a waffler , or a mute when you 're usually a together person who gives well-thought-out responses . Not surprisingly , they lurk at work . Lethal line : " My boss always makes me look like am airheaded ditz in front of our company president , " says Greta Casperson , 36 , an advertising executive . " At a recent meeting , the big cheese mentioned that we needed to bring in some new clients . My boss turned to me and asked , ' Why are n't we bringing in new business ? ' It 's her bottom-line responsibility , but she put me on the spot and I did n't have an answer . I looked like an incompetent imbecile . " Detox strategy : This is all about control  --  who has it and who wants it . " These pugilist are threatened by you for one reason or another , " says Glass . " They clearly want to intimidate you into submission . " But once you recognize their verbal-KO MO , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down for the count . If they put you on the spot with a tough question , do n't feel pressured into answering it right away . You do n't have to respond on their terms . " Do n't evade the question , because that will just make them go after you even more , " says Rosen . " Just tell them you need time to think about it and would be glad to go over the issue later . " The experts agree : When it comes to the off-putting commentary , a sense of humor is your best defense . " Every time we speak , I know my boss will say something to try to throw me off , " says Casperson . " Now I always say , ' Let me make a few inquiries amd get back to you on that . ' " This simple response makes Casperson look like she has a plan instead of making her look like she does n't have a handle on her work . TOXIC TYPE 5 The Guiltmonger Warning signs : You could offer to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't feel bad about her recent breakup and you still would n't be considered giving enough by this toxic type 's tough standards . That 's because absolutely nothing you do-no amount of time , money , energy , or love-will prove to her that you care . The worst part is , the more you give to this energy-sucker , the less you have for other people you care about-so you 're stuck in a perpetual cycle of feeling guilty about something and trying to make up for it . Arg ! Lethal line : " Whenever I visit my grandmother in Florida , no matter how long I stay , no matter how soon I promise to come back , she still makes me feel guilty about not coming more often , " says Lara Klein , 31 , a social worker in New Brunswick , New Jersey . " I love her dearly and I know she 's lonely , but I only have two weeks of vacation a year , and I spend at least one with her . Still , the last time I went down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely-she was down here for a whole month last winter . But I understand , you 're very busy with your work and it 's no fun to spend time with an old lady like me . ' I felt absolutely terrible about it . " Detox strategy : The temptation for well  --  meaning friends and relatives of the Guiltmonger is to give until it hults . Don't-they still wo n't be happy , and you 'll still be miserable . " These are people who are never satisfied with themselves , and they 're looking to you to make them feel satisfied , which does n't work , " says author Glass . Step one is to do a reality check . Ask objective friends if they think you 're being a bad friend/daughter/employee for not doing whatever it is the Guiltmonger seems to want . If they say no , then draw your line and stick to it . " Be direct , " advises Glass . Say you care about them and are glad to help , but you feel you 're doing as much as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , I 've done what I have to do , and I 'm not going to allow you to make me feel bad , " ' says Glass . Of course , it 's easier to forgive a Guiltmonger who is elderly or infirm , which motivates you to go beyond the call of duty to help . " What they want is affection , " says Glass . " If you stand tall in what you can do , but show them as much love as you can , that should help . " Footnote * Some names have been changed . // <p>
