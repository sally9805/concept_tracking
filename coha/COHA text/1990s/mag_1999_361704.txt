If I had to explain the bottomless public fascination with the story of the Titanic , I would n't pin it on the idea that the sunken ship represented a moral tale of hubris or of careless luxury but rather on the fact that it was both a magnificent and flawed piece of work , and that it became most interesting when it was lying out of reach underwater . How to get down to it and bring it to the surface ? How to grasp something so wonderful , confident and ruined , a creation as immense as the past ? <P> Or , given the approaching holiday , am I thinking of fathers and their unreachable , unfathomable greatness ? Fathers and sons ; father knows best ; life with father . Farther and farther away they grow , not only when they die and are sunk for good but in life too . Big Daddy . Daddy Long Legs . For Father 's Day , to be on the safe side , better order extra extra large . <P> When a man becomes a father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sta-Puf Marshmallow Man in Ghostbusters . His shoes do n't fit ; his hatband leaves a mark . He can barely see his feet , at which his children gather , look up and can barely see his head . And the weight ! I have tried to dredge my father from his ocean floor for nearly 25 years , since he went down , at the fairly young age of 67 . In a decade or so , I will be older that he is , or was , yet I come no closer to reaching him now than when I was a kid . Old as I get , I shall never be smarter , surer , bigger . I dive for clues in the dark water . I go down to go up . <P> With my father and me , it was World War III ( All-Nukes ) much of the time , yet even in more serene relationships , everything gets overblown . Children strain to get their arms around their father 's thighs . Too thick , too strong . Today my boys can beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can outrun me in a race ; no sweat . But they do not savor these victories . I am the father who should not be conquered . One afternoon when I was 14 , my father , once a powerful and muscular swimmer , ran out of breath as we swam to a float in Cape Cod Bay . Panting like a hooked fish , he leaned on me as we swam back . My heart sank . <P> But of course , he could never be anything but monumental . It is the fate of fathers to be enormous , and the responsibility as well . One must be careful not to abuse one 's stature , not to be harsh , not to bully , not to crush . God the Father must have known something of that self-governing caution when he realized that he could never pick on anyone his own size . <P> And yet one falls . I hear the hearts of my own children sink whenever I am petty , selfish , small . I am not supposed to be small . The day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-on-one  --  at last , killed his dad !  --  I fumed like a Nero , stalked off , refused to shake his hand . I 'm surprised that I did not disappear through a crack in the playground . <P> No one thinks of giants from the giant 's point of view , but it 's not easy being big . One is aware of the menace one poses as he stomps about . Dad wants to be a benevolent despot , but he has all that heft , and sometimes he crashes into the china . " Pop ! Pop ! " cries Keye Luke , the No. 1 son in the Charlie Chan movies . His incompetence is funny , but he is really desperate to please the All-Wise , All-Wisecracking round Titan in the white suit , who is sometimes the detective and sometimes the crime .
