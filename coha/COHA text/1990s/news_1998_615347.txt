<p> Highlands , N.C. - Blame it on the altitude . There 's something about the air at 4,118 feet above sea level that renders you powerless over all that merchandise calling your name from the rows of shops along Main Street . The spiffy clothing , the dazzling jewelry , the handblown glass Christmas ornaments , the antique cuckoo clock from the Black Forest , the mint-condition Majolica , the Bubba teeth . . . the Bubba teeth ? The decaying , gap-toothed dentures straight out of " Deliverance " were flying out of the Toy Store on Main Street at $ 15 a pop  --  a novelty among the mostly upscale offerings in this mountain shopping mecca that has been charming browsers and buyers for decades . Highlands was founded as a summer resort in 1875 by Samuel Kelsey and Clinton Hutchinson , whose names are immortalized in the new Kelsey &; Hutchinson Lodge perched above the town at Spring and Fourth streets . In 1928 , the Highlands Country Club was built and Old Buckhead headed north for the summer . While the permanent population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number rises to 20,000 . But more and more , the town is becoming a year-round haven for hikers , anglers , white-water rafters , golfers , skiers  --  and shoppers . " Used to be we did n't open the door until Memorial Day and we closed it up after Labor Day , " says Christy Kelly , executive director of the Highlands Chamber of Commerce . " Now , most merchants are open at least through December or January , and many are staying open all year . " The day after Thanksgiving is the biggest shopping day of the season . " Everybody comes up Thanksgiving , " says Ann Jacob , who runs galleries in Buckhead and Highlands . " They come in droves . " It 's hard to imagine the town being more crowded than on a recent October weekend , when No Vacancy signs were ubiqitous and cars cruised Main Street in a game of motorized musical chairs , drivers hoping to snag a freshly vacated parking space . " The town lighting is Friday night after Thanksgiving , " says Kelly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's the good news . On the flip side : There are no longer the deep discounts retailers offered on Thanksgiving weekend to clear out their inventory before closing for the season . One thing is certain : The shopping opportunities continue to grow . <p> It 's not exactly urban sprawl , but the shopping district is no longer confined to two blocks on Main Street  --  home to such mainstays as Wit 's End Shops ( classic ladies apparel since 1940 ) and Scudder 's Galleries  --  and " on the hill " along Fourth Street between Main and Spring streets . New businesses have opened just blocks away at Highlands Plaza , Wright Square and Mountain Brook Center and on U.S. 64 toward Cashiers , where you 'll find the Apple Mountain Shoppes , Celtic Crown and a new location ( still under construction ) of Thoroughbreds women 's clothing store . Serious shoppers should pick up a shopping guide and map at the Chamber of Commerce in Town Hall , a block off Main Street on Fourth Street . Shop serendipitously , picking a starting point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of doors , pausing when something catches your fancy . <p> I purred over fabulously soft Scottish cashmere sweaters at McCulley 's on Church Street , where the hand-woven intarsia designs are original and the prices range from the high $ 200s to more than $ 700 . Shoppers sip free hot mulled cider at Christmas Tree while admiring Dickensian villages and hundreds of ornaments . A rustic Santa face sculpted in resin on a large piece of found wood by an Ohio artist named Jewel caught my eye ( $ 189 ; smaller pieces start at $ 14.95 ) . We found wonderful handmade wreaths of dried flowers , herbs and fruits at the Little Flower Shoppe ( $ 150-$ 650 ) . Afghans galore hang for easy inspection at Goodwin Weavers ( $ 14.95-$ 79 ; most are $ 39.99 ) . Azure Rose Quilts has quilts , shams and bedding sets ( some only $ 149-$ 169 ) and festive quilted Christmas throws ( $ 29-$ 119 ) . At Annawear , Anna Herz 's distinctive block-printed clothing for women and children in natural , garment-dyed fabrics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and retail outlets across the country . Most items are less than $ 50 . Cigar aficionados can step inside the new walk-in humidor at Highlands Emporium , where proprietor Steven Fishkin sells premium brands such as Arturo Fuente , Cohiba , Partagas , Bauza and Macanudo  --  most in the $ 5-$ 15 range . At Southern Hands , the conversation piece du jour was artist Tom McCabe 's found-object metal sculptures called Nutzenboltz  --  figures involved in golfing , yardwork or leaf raking ( $ 290-$ 560 ) . Hate squirrels scarfing down the birdseed you put out ? The Bird Barn on Main Street has an electronic bird feeder ( $ 129.50 ) that gives furry-tailed trespassers a mild electric shock . Sooner or later , it seems everyone winds up at Kilwin 's on Main or SweeTreats at Mountain Brook Center for ice cream and fudge . A quick sugar fix , then more sidewalk pounding . Debbie Nye of Augusta and her husband , David  --  making their annual fall getaway " for refreshment without the kids "  --  did the shopping scene on Saturday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she 'd done the rounds . " It 's real peaceful up here , " she says , rocking on the porch at one of the Kelsey &; Hutchinson Lodge cottages . Meanwhile , on Main Street , stores were turning over the " open " signs . And cars began circling .
