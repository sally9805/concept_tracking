Does the answer to your current crisis lie in a past life ? Why do thousands of perfectly sane women now swear they 've been reincarnated ? Cosmo examines the growing phenomenon of past-life therapy . By Denise Lanctot Photograph Royal regression : Maybe you were a princess in a past life . // Allison Benzer* , at 28-year-old graphic artist from New York City , found her heart racing with a sense of familiar anticipation as her plane landed in Florence . It was literally a " dream " vacation , for many of the sites she visited for the first time she remembered having seen already in her dreams . Allison felt oddly at home , for she 'd always gravitated toward things Italian-food , furniture , and her favorite artists were from the Renaissance . With deja vu , she navigated the city without the aid of maps . Wandering into a monastery courtyard , she saw the same lion-clawed bench and fountain she 'd been there before . . . hundreds of years ago . BiBi Lawrence , a 26-year-old Los Angeles actress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met Brian at her nephew 's bar mitzvah . Their eyes locked , and after hours of nonstop talk , they felt like they 'd known each other for years ! It was eerie each knew what the other was going to say before it was said , and when they embraced , a bolt of mutual recognition surged through their hearts . BiBi was convinced they were soul mates in a previous life . When Jeanine Morris , a 34-year-old real-estate broker , was invited by her fiance to cruise the Caribbean for her birthday , she was too embarrassed to reveal a lifelong fear of drowning . Hoping to overcome her terror , she sought help from Miami , Florida , therapist Linda Adler , president-elect of the 950member California-based Association for Past-Life Research and Therapies , who used hypnosis to regress her patient to the time when her fear began . Jeanine went back centuries . " She discovered two drownings from past lives , one in the ocean , another in a lake , " says Adler . Reliving her past-life traumas and analyzing the experience healed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to report , " My fear is gone ! I actually swam in the ocean and had a wonderful time ! " Reincarnation Nation Did Jeanine , BiBi , and Allison experience memories from genuine past lives , or were their imaginations soaring to New Age heights ? Is it possible they really have lived before ? Does everyone have past and future lives ? If you believe in reincarnation , the answer is a resounding yes . Reincarnation , an ancient philosophy rooted in the Eastern religions of Buddhism and Hinduism , teaches that a soul survives death and returns to Earth time and time again , each time in a new body . And Western science is now checking it out . Ian Stevenson , M.D. , Carlson professor of psychiatry at the University of Virginia School of Medicine , hats spent the past 30 years collecting more than 2,600 reported cases of past-life memories by children around the world . In Children Who Remember Previous Lives : A Question of Reincarnation ( University Press of Virginia , 1987 ) , Dr. Stevenson documents cases in which these children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak of other mommies and daddies , of being marrlied , dying violent deaths , living in distant times and foreign lands . Their memories stand up to verification when they mention real names , dates , and places that Dr. Stevenson and his team visit for confirmation . An abundance of findings matching their Claims suggests these children either have a super kind of ESP enabling them to pick up the memories of a real person or they have indeed been reincarnated . An eloquent argument for reincarnation is xenoglossy-the ability to speak a foreign tongue without any prior knowledge or exposure to that language . A famous case documented in Sylvia Cranston and Carey Williams 's Reincarnation : A Nev Horizon in Science , Religion al Society ( Theosophical University Press , 1993 ) occurred in the 1920s in Manhattan , when a pair of 3-year-okl fraternal twin boys spoke to each other in a language only they could understand . Their parents , Dr. and Mrs. Marshall WV McDuffie , were convinced it was n't baby talk and brought the boys to the foreign-language department at Columbia University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly extinct language popular in the time of Christ , 2,000 years ago ! Also in the 1920s , Edgar Cayce , the legendary Kentucky-born psychic , shocked Americans by introducing them to the idea that " each of us goes through a series of lifetimes for the purpose of spiritual growth and soul development . " IIe likened Earth to a school for souls , with classes in love , forgiveness , patience , understanding , and charity , and maintained that each person is given as many experiences or lessons in as many lifetimes as needed to grow and learn . By extension , death is no more traumatic than being in a holding pattern over Kennedy Airport , where you circle your life , reviewing your actions to determine where more spiritual development is needed before landing again . Cayce , a Christian who incorporated tenets of Buddhism into his teachings , believed people usually reincarnate among those they 've known before ; a lover in this life may be your child in the next , a best friend may show up as a spouse , a rival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and race and sex vary from lifetime to lifetime . People with whom you feel an immediate attraction ( or repulsion ) tend to be people with whom you 've interacted before , since people travel through lifetimes with a core group of souls . " But once you 've finished whatever lessons you 've wanted to learn with those persons , you wo n't necessarily reincarnate with them again , " explains Leslie Austin , Ph.D. , a reincarnation therapist with aI private practice in Manhattan . Post-Life Shrinkage " Past-life regression therapy involves the mental act of going back , through hypnosis , to a time prior to this life in order to retrieve memories that may still negatively influence a patients present life and are probably the source of symptoms running the gamut from phobias to addictions : explains Brian L. Weiss , an Ivy League-trained psychiatrist with a private practice in Miami , Florida , whose books Many Lives , Many Masters ( Fireside 1988 ) , Through Time Into Healing ( Touchstone Books , 1993 ) , and Only Love Is Real : A Story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ docment his hard-won conversion from reincarnation skeptic to ardent believer . ( Linda Adler of the Association for Past-Life Research and Therapies is quick to stress , however , that neither patient nor therapist necessarily has to be a believer in past lives for reincarnation therapy to be successful . ) Dr. Weiss 's first patient was Catherine , the subject of Many Lives , Many Masters , a 27-year-old lab technician from a strict New England Catholic background who came to him in 1980 with unexplained anxieties , panic attacks , and depression . After a year of conventional psychotherapy , Catherine remained severely impaired and consented to hypnosis as an alternative . When Dr. Weiss asked her to go back to a time when her fears first arose , expecting her to return to early childhood in this life , Catherine flipped back to a life 4,000 years ago ! Over the next few months , she relived more than a dozen past lives-including as an 18th-century Spanish prostitute , a Greek woman , and an Egyptian girl-all viti a sophistication as to historical detail that she had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggled with their beliefs , which did not include reincarnation . But witnessing her improvement , Dr. Weiss continued regressing Catherine . The more past lives she remembered , the more her symptoms disappeared , until she was completely cured . In fact , just a week after her first session , in which she had recalled drowning violently in a flood in ancient times , her recurring nightmare of a collapsing bridge ceased , and her chronic fear of choking subsided . " I became convinced , " explains Dr. Weiss , " that past-life therapy offers a rapid , cost-effective , highly credible method of relieving symptoms that would normally take years to treat . " Skeptical Healing Curious but somewhat dubious of past-life cures and claims , I accepted Dr. Weiss 's invitation to attend his daylong past-life seminar last April , at the Marriott Hotel in New York City . In a ballroom with the lights dimmed , Dr. Weiss gently guided me and some 200 other participants through a series of meditation techniques in order to relax and regress the group to subconscious past-life memories . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a man in the 1600s ! I was a Dutch sailor with a large family in Antwerp , and while it was a fairly uneventful life , it was one blessed with love . After experiencing a painless death , I floated above the bed where my family had gathered , and as I looked down , I knew the lesson of that life-which I cold carry on to the next-was to love all people as if they are family , for in fact they are . As the lights came tip in the ballroom , happy tears were streaming down my face . In the last moments of my past-life experience , I looked into the eyes of my beloved daughter in that life and recognized her as my nephew in t is life-a little boy for whom I felt an instant and deep love the moment I held him . Based on this brief , intense , and enlightening experience , I was eager to see what I might find in a full-fledged one-onone session that would last an hour and a half . A week later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Margaret Haas , who regressed me to a life in Puritan times , where from the barred window of a basement cell , I watched the wheels of horse-drawn carts and the blackstockinged legs of men in breeches hurrying along a dirt road . I was an 18-year-old girl in a floor-length gray chambray dress sentenced to isolation and ultimately tortured to death . My crime ? I had kept a secret journal telling of the wrongs of a joyless life where hell and damnation ruled and women were silenced . I wrote that their vengeful God was not my God and mistakenly shared this with my best friend , who gave the book to my father , a church elder and therefore obliged to turn me in . I was imprisoned as a " little witch , " my heels were seared with red-hot prods , my hands set afire over open flames . Once dead , I floated above my body being wheeled on a cart to a pauper 's grave . It was difficult watching this life unfold-I wept quietly , as if grieving for a former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocks I may experience as a writer in this life are rooted in that past . Since that day , I have written prolifically . And even as I left the session , I noticed that the chronic pain in my heels , which I 'd always attributed to years of walking city streets , had mysteriously disappeared . Am I now convinced I 've lived before ? Let 's just say I 'm with Voltaire : " It is no more surprising to be born twice than once . " And as for the efficacy of past-life therapy , I plan on buying my best friend a one-on-one session for her birthday In practical terms , the prism of past lives can offer many facets to understanding your life today . Hazel M. Denning , Ph.D. , a founder of the Association for Past-Life Research and Therapies and still practicing at the age of 90 , sums it up : " It does n't matter whether your problem is spiritual , physical , emotional , or mental-to understand and experience your past lives will help you with the here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what your purpose is in this life .

I discovered in regression therapy that my most recent past life was as a very wealthy European man who died in the early 1930s at the wheel of a fancy roadster . There were three other people in my car , and I was flirting with a woman in the backseat when I drove off a cliff . The car exploded , and as we all lay dying , I swore I 'd never forgive myself . I realized that I was experiencing irrational guilt about having money , associating it with people dying at my hands . Since I learned to forgive myself , I 've been doing great financially .
