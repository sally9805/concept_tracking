The Offspring is a best-selling punk band , but it is n't a great one : the group lacks the caustic poetry of Nirvana , the righteous snarl of Rancid and the amiable snottiness of Green Day . In its new album the Offspring attempts to make a virtue of its creative limitations : the songs on Americana are basic and direct , and a few of the tracks , including The Kids Are n't Alright , have a brutal appeal . But the band 's weakness for cheap laughs soon grows tiresome  --  there 's even a punk-rock parody of the easily mocked standard Feelings . For a group that revels in attacking the emptiness of contemporary culture , it has made a pretty empty-headed album . <P>  --  By Christopher John Farley
