One of the toughest parts of parenting is the seemingly endless series of decisions you have to make . Breast-feeding or formula ? Cloth or disposable ? Day care or the mommy track ? It is not as though there is an absolute right answer to any of these questions  --  yet parents often feel the wrong choice could be disastrous . That is especially true when it comes to spanking . Every parent has been in a situation where a whack on the rear seems like the only recourse to little Janie 's or Johnny 's tantrum . But at least since the 1960s , the conventional wisdom propounded by parenting gurus has been that hitting is generally unwise because it sends a message that violence is an acceptable way to solve disputes . <P> Now comes a scientific study that frames the issue in larger societal terms . Writing in the journal Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine , University of New Hampshire sociologist Murray Straus and his colleagues report that " when parents use corporal punishment to reduce antisocial behavior , the long-term effect tends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the authors suggest that if you spare the rod , you will help reduce the overall level of violence in American society . <P> Straus ' study , first presented at a conference in 1994 and now appearing in formal publication with a more careful analysis of the data , is highly controversial . It may prove something , say critics , but not what Straus thinks it does . <P> The problem has to do with who was in the study . Straus and company culled their information from telephone interviews conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics beginning in 1979 with 807 mothers of children ages 6 to 9 . They were asked how many times they had spanked their children in the past week and what the kids ' behavior was like  --  did they lie , cheat , act up in school ? Then the bureau polled the same group two years later . Sure enough , the kids who had been spanked had become increasingly antisocial . <P> But when you look a little closer at these findings , they start to seem a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Montgomery , Ala. , pediatrician who is vocal in the spanking debate , the mothers ranged in age from 14 to 21 . That is hardly a representative slice of American motherhood . Moreover , those who spanked did so on average twice a week . These factors , says Trumbull , plus the fact that some of the kids were as old as nine , " are markers of a dysfunctional family in my mind , and in the minds of most psychologists and pediatricians . " <P> Trumbull also observes that limiting the study to 6-to-9 year-olds skewed the results : by then kids can understand the consequences of their actions . For them frequent physical punishment is likely to be humiliating and traumatic  --  and might well lead to worse behavior down the line . <P> Straus disagrees . He writes , " It is plausible to argue that corporal punishment of toddlers will have a greater effect than it does on older kids because it occurs at a crucial developmental stage .
