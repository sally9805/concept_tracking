CLAIRE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they 're not . The strange thing is you 're usually very lucid and capable of understanding complex thoughts .

CLAIRE Tell me , Richard , if my memory serves me correctly  --  ( stops and laughs at herself ) Are n't I being ironic ? RICHARD You make that joke every day . CLAIRE Hm . Do you ever laugh ? RICHARD No . CLAIRE How sad . Anyway , if my memory serves me correctly , is n't amnesia usually brought on by some sort of physical or psychological trauma ? RICHARD ( beat ) Uh I 'm not sure what you mean . CLAIRE I mean something horrible happens and then amnesia kicks in . Yes , I believe that 's correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RICHARD I need to hop into the shower . CLAIRE I do n't usually mention trauma , do I ? RICHARD No . Actually you 've never mentioned it .

Otherwise I  --  I do n't what I 'm gon na  --  May I have a hit ? KENNY What ? RICHARD Just a little one . To take the edge off . ( KENNY passes him the joint . Richard takes a hit . ) RICHARD ( holding breath in ) I really should n't be doing this , but I 'm worried about your mom and  --  ( suddenly ) Did I ever tell you about the time I met Dennis Hopper ? ( A siren blares in distance . ) RICHARD Aw geez , it 's the fuzz . ( tosses joint out the window ) Open the windows . Air it out . ( pulls over ) See what happens , Kenny ? Drugs lead to crime . Let that be a lesson . Try and act natural . ( waits for cop ) Jeepers . I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Bloodshot ? KENNY Shut up , moron . ( HEIDI , a cop , approaches . ) RICHARD How-do , officer ? HEIDI In a hurry this morning ? p. 37 RICHARD Not especially . I 'm just out for a drive with the boy , playing some " I Spy , " heading to the Friendly 's for a treat . HEIDI Kinda early for a Fribble , is n't it ? RICHARD Not for this family . We love ice cream . Right , Kenny ? HEIDI I clocked you going eighty-four in a fifty-five zone . RICHARD Is that right ? Well , I 'll be . Maybe that speedy-radar thingy of yours needs new batteries . ( KENNY gets a giggle-fit which may last through the scene . ) HEIDI Have you been smoking marijuana in this vehicle , sir ? RICHARD No ma'am I have not . HEIDI Smells like maybe someone was , sir . RICHARD Well , Kenny here , I must admit was toking up a bit of the doobage , so to speak . HEIDI I 'll be needing your license @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you both to step out of the vehicle . RICHARD Oh , you misunderstood me . You see , Kenny here has glaucoma and he smokes pot for purely medicinal purposes . HEIDI And do you have a letter from your doctor stating as much ? p. 38 RICHARD Actually , our doctor had a terrible accident and he no longer has hands , so writing a note is n't possible for him right now . But as soon as he 's fitted for prosthetic limbs and learns how to write with those awkward little hooks I 'll pass the note onto the highway patrol office . HEIDI I believe you 're lying to me , sir . RICHARD No , he was fiddling inside a lawn mower in between operations and  --  HEIDI Sir ? RICHARD All right , I 'm lying . But Kenny here is a troubled teen and  --  Fritos ! I suddenly want Fritos ! Are you craving Fritos , Kenny ? ( snickers ) KENNY Mmmmm . Fritos . HEIDI ( pulls gun on him ) Please step out of the vehicle , sir ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we need you pulling a Rodney King here . HEIDI Get out of the car ! RICHARD Okay . We 're getting out , but this is all much ado about nothing , eh Kenny ? ( They step out of car , HEIDI 's gun on them . KENNY is trying not to giggle. ) p. 39 HEIDI License and registration please . RICHARD ( hands them over ) This is all very unnecessary , officer . You see , my wife has a form of psychogenic amnesia , and she wandered off this morning HEIDI I think I 've heard just about enough of your stories , tough guy . RICHARD Tough guy ? I 'm not tough guy . I 'm nice guy . Everyone I know calls me nice guy . HEIDI ( looking at license ) Well , Mr. Fiffle , if that 's your real name , I 'm gon na radio back to headquarters and have them pop your name into a computer and see what turns up . RICHARD Headquarters ? Computer ? No ! No ! No ! ( He goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No ! " He twists her wrist so she drops the gun . He scrambles for it and points it at her . ) RICHARD Well , the shoe 's on the other hand now , is n't it , copper ? HEIDI Sir , I am a police officer , which means you need to return my revolver . RICHARD I 'm sorry , but that is n't possible . You see , I have a very complicated past and ca n't afford your popping my name into any computer . So I 'm afraid you 're gon na have to come with us. p. 40 KENNY You 're gon na get us thrown in jail , shit-for-brains . RICHARD You know what , Kenny ? I wish you 'd stop calling me names . It hurts my feelings . HEIDI Sir , why do n't you just head on home , I 'll forget I stopped you and we 'll call it a day . RICHARD Because I have to find my wife !

CLAIRE You 're such a Nervous Nellie . MILLET Hey , where 'd you get that ring ? CLAIRE ( notices it for the first time ) Oh . I do n't know . MILLET Principal Leone had a ring just like that . CLAIRE Who 's Principal Leone ? MILLET My old boss . I used to be janitor at a grade school . CLAIRE Is that right ? MILLET And Principal Leone had a ring just like that . Hers had a nice diamond in the middle and two rubies on the side . Every morning I would say " Hello Principal Leone . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whore wrecked your life !

He just told you to not say anything about me , right ? MILLET She She said I scared the children . I would growl at them and chase them with my pail of sawdust for fun . And she said I scared the children . CLAIRE I 'm sorry , Millet . MILLET And the next day , when I woke up , there were two cops standing over my bed . And they said I beat up Principal Leone in the parking lot and stole her ring . Which was very surprising to me . I mean , in court I had to admit that I had just been fired , and yes I had said I liked her ring , and it was true that often I have blackouts , but I 'm not a violent person .

Does he ever say anything about me ? MILLET Sure . He calls you his little blank thlate . CLAIRE Really ? Does he ever say why I 'm his little blank thlate ? MILLET Uhh I 'm not really allowed to talk about it . CLAIRE Oh , right . MILLET It 's just he has these plans  --  CLAIRE Plans ?

CLAIRE Well , he has n't said anything too damaging yet . MILLET ( as puppet ) Give it time , bitch ! p. 46 CLAIRE I wish he did n't have such a foul mouth . MILLET Yeah , me too .
