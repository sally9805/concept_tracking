The shift of including children with special needs in the regular classroom is a major instructional shift in the public schools of the 90 's . Since elementary school teachers rarely have the requisite training , both in general and adaptive methods , to work with special needs students this paper outlines specific strategies to aid the teaching of mathematics successfully to these students in the regular classroom . The emphasis to educate students with special needs in the regular classroom emphasizes the need to use hands-on , flexible group instruction , using a wide variety of activities and learning styles , as well as making math more enjoyable and meaningful for all students . <p> The education of students with disabilities in regular classrooms is a major school reform sift in the 1990s . Lipsky &; Gartner ( 1993 ) see inclusion as the logical extension of the reform of special education and that of general education , which have taken place largely in isolation . They consider that the two streams of educational reform should come together at the policy level , national , state , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrative functioning ; in school building operations ; in classroom practices ; in research ; and in personnel preparation . <p> The concept of inclusion is not without its challengers , especially in relation to severely handicapped students with intensive special needs . To make provision for these students , Fitzgerald , et . al . ( 1993 ) suggests three levels of inclusion . The first is limited inclusion , the second moderate inclusion , and the third level full inclusion . In a review of thirty cases of students with severe disabilities which had been referred to the courts , Brady , et . al . ( 1989 ) found that judges made decisions on a case-by-case basis . The courts indicated that sometimes students with severe disabilities can not benefit from education in an integrated setting , and that levels of inclusion would seem to be warranted . <p> Although many states are committed to the idea of inclusion , for example Texas , the reality is that the process is preceding slowly for several reasons . Morsink and Lenk ( 1992 ) cite three : ( a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ b ) the teacher 's attitude and training , and ( c ) the impact of inclusion on other students . Most regular education teachers lack the requisite training , both in general adaptive methods and in specific techniques to work with students with special needs ( Pressley &; Harris , 1990 ) . This prompted Warger and Pugach ( 1993 ) to suggest that regular and special educators need to redirect their focus away from student differences and toward the curriculum and the learning experiences that take place in the classroom . In this era of curriculum reform it behooves all educators to consider what is means to embed the teaching of fundamental skills into meaningful activities that can be utilized by students with a wide range of individual differences . Purpose <p> This article describes general strategies for individualizing instruction in an integrated third grade math classroom and outlines specific strategies for use with students with special education needs such as a deaf student ( language abilities at first grade level ) ; a nine-year-old who is severely mentally retarded ( functioning at the four-year-old level ) and two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The following strategies are suggested for dealing with aforementioned students ( adapted from Putnam , 1993 ) : Restructure the classroom to optimize learning by spending less time on whole class instruction and more time on group activities . Make use of a variety of instructional materials , educational media and technology . Special needs students as well as slower learners need concrete hands-on activities rather than abstract pencil and paper activities . Involve students in learning by providing some choice of topics or activities to be worked on while recognizing that some students respond better to structure and organization . Analyze students ' learning styles through observation and conferences with students and parents . Provide supplemental instruction to meet the learning style . Provide ongoing feedback and evaluation of learning through authentic measures of assessment , e.g. , in addition to pencil and paper tests of computational skills , use written accounts of activities and answers to question such as " What I liked about this activity , " " What I learned from this activity , " " What was difficult ? , " " What could I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are suggested . Select appropriate instructional objectives . Identify materials and manipulatives to be used and learning strategies for presenting these . Determine group size and membership for specific experiences . Specify individual and group performances criteria . Make provision for activities that expand/extend concepts being developed ( adapted from Putnam , 1993 ) . <p> How would the above translate into practice in the third grade classroom already described ? Assume the goal of instruction is to teach a unit on division ( up to , and including division of two-digit numbers by one-digit numbers ) . what objectives , learning experiences , could be provided to individualize instruction for the students in the classroom who have such a wide range of individual differences ? Each of the specific strategies suggested will be looked at in more detail . 1 . Select appropriate instructional objectives . <p> The following objectives are appropriate , although not all the groups would meet/attain all of the objectives . 1 . Understand the concept of division as partitioning or sharing , and measurement . 2 . Recognize division as repeated subtraction. 3 . Use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review multiplication facts . 4 . Solve word problems pertaining to division . 5 . Relate the process of division to daily living activities . 6 . Develop belief system about personal competence in mathematics . Identify materials and manipulatives to be used and learning strategies for presenting these . 1 . Commercially developed manipulatives , such as Cuisenaire rods , or Stern Structural Math Blocks , for students to discover : how many " 6 " blocks will fit into a line of blocks made with three " 10 " blocks should be used . ( Could be worded as follows : Mary baked 30 cup-cakes . There were 6 children at the party . How many cupcakes would each child get ? ) 2 . Teacher or student made manipulatives , for example baskets with cut-out Easter eggs , green construction paper , and cut-out animals to be placed in the fields . The more capable students can be encouraged to think of problem situations to be solved with manipulatives and may help make these at a construction center . 3 . Math challenge cards either commercially or teacher-made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to take 24 children on a field trip , how many children will ride in each car ? " Graph paper and drawing paper . 4 . Instructional aids such as Dataman and Speak and Math computer programs for review of multiplication facts ; Basic Math Competency Skills Drills ; card games for review of same ; calculators for making multiplication fact matrixes and solving division problems by repeated subtraction ; number lines marked from 0-100 to show division as jumps back to " 0 " from selected points . 5 . Trade books about division and multiplication and mathematics in general classroom text , workbook pages for computation and self-checking opportunities . For example , provide student with stopwatch to time length of time needed to complete activity ; note number of correct answers and try to improve on personal record , etc . Determine group size and membership for specific experiences . <p> Group size and membership will vary according to the needs of the students . Membership should be based on " needs " and not on ability levels alone . Both auditorially-impaired students , and students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partition or sharing as well as gifted students , since these activities enable them to view and understand the two aspects of division : measurement and partitive. ( 28/4=7 may be interpreted as the answer to the question of how many sets of 4 apples may be formed from a set of 28 apples or , alternatively , as the answer to the question of how many apples each of 4 children gets when 28 apples are divided equally among them . ) <p> Some of the more capable students will realize that they are looking at a familiar number scale ( the 4x table ) from a different viewpoint when using Stem blocks to find how many 4s are in , for example , 24 , 28 , or 32 . Groups of five or six students should be formed , of which one of the more capable students should record group findings . <p> Computer time for the auditorially-impaired student for drill and practice should be assigned . The computer can serve as reinforcement for the more capable student . <p> Most children should be capable of using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over from 28/4=7 + 0 to 4square root 28=7 . This second notation is the beginning step for long division , it needs to be taught , and students need to be familiar with both forms of division so they recognize them as identical . However , not all groups will be ready to subtract the difference as in the problem 39/6 = 6 square root 39 and to show the problem as ( Multiple line equation(s) can not be represented in ASCII text 4 . Specify group or individual performance criteria . <p> Performance criteria should be developed on an individual basis for students . Mathematics portfolios could be used for this purpose . They should contain descriptions of activities , learning experiences , work sheets , charts , graphs , formal paper and pencil computations as well as solution to word problems . All work samples should initially be included . <p> The above may help the teacher assess the level of the student 's understanding but would need to be augmented by oral interviews to determine the thought processes used as well as performance assessments . ( Performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being taught . ) <p> According to Lesh &; Lamon ( 1991 ) , evalutions , tests , and other tools for determining the effects of instruction , must belong to the instructional process itself so instruction and evaluation can result from the same experience . <p> A good activity , which directly relates to real life , would be to have students plan a class party for thirty ; e.g. , if there are seven tables , and two were used for serving , how many students would sit at each table , etc ? <p> If it is necessary to determine a grade , acceptable performance criteria should be stated in advance , e.g. , for deaf students acceptable performance for a six-week period of a division unit ( of a two-digit number by a one-digit number ) could consist of the following : one written book report , fifteen worksheets , demonstrate 2-level increase in drill on multiplication facts , five weekly quizzes with each 80% mastered , and completion of one performance assessment . <p> For the gifted student , acceptable criteria might consist of six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests on problem solving , completion of 48 challenge card , six weekly quizzes and one performance assessment . 5 . Make provision for activities which expand/extend concepts being developed . <p> This can best be done through the use of learning centers at which the material is changed from week to week , e.g. , the media center could include video tapes such as " Donald in Mathmagic Land , " which explores mathconcepts , films about the history of mathematics , and the development of different number systems . <p> Computer centers could include programs such as " Introduction to Mathematics on the Computer , " which has six levels if difficulty in basic operations but requires only a second-grade reading level . For learning centers , teachers need to make up activity folders containing activity cards , practice sheets , and written material . <p> Students requiring special services may be provided individualized activities developed by the teacher or a collaborative teacher . This teacher might work directly with the students for a designated number of hours per week . Consultative teachers advise and assist the classroom teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and activities . Summary <p> General strategies to facilitate the inclusion of students with special needs into the regular classroom were presented . Specific strategies for implementation in a third grade mathematics classroom were described . Inclusion is a form of individualization and need not mean one-on-one instruction . Activities for use with special needs students can be used by all students . Through the use of a wider variety of activities and more hands-on instruction in flexible groups , mathematics can be made more meaningful and more enjoyable for all students . Games should be provided for enrichment such as " Math in Brief : #5 which has 6 game mats , game markers , spinners , etc. for division factors 2 through 9 . <p> In today 's classrooms where teachers are dealing more and more with special students , it is imperative that regular teachers are shown some strategies of how to deal with this population . This paper deals with specific strategies to successfully teach third grade math . Activities are described which benefit both the regular and specialist in the elementary classroom . The educational shift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the regular classroom emphasizes the need to use hands-on instruction in flexible groups using a wide variety of activities and learning styles to make math more enjoyable and meaningful for all students . <p>
