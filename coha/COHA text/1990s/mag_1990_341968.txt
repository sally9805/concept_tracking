One reason the U.S. voting rate is so low is that each state  --  and even some election districts  --  has its own tangle of registration requirements and procedures . The discouraging maze keeps many citizens from voting . Thus the House in February passed a sweeping reform bill that would permit registration by mail and at various state agencies . Most significantly , anyone receiving or renewing a driver 's license would be given a voter-registration form to sign . <P> Last week , though a majority of Senators were ready to approve the measure , Republicans mounted a filibuster . Concerned that most of the new votes would go to Democrats , they argued that the reform bill would make registration too easy , too expensive to administer and open to abuse . With only two Republicans  --  Oregon 's Mark Hatfield and Bob Packwood  --  joining the Democrats in trying to end the filibuster , reform forces fell five short of the 60 needed to cut off debate . The bill died .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
