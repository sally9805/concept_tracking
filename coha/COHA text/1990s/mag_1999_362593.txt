Imagine losing the Vietnam War , then going back for a replay . That 's what Russia appears to be doing in Chechnya . Three years after suffering one of the most humiliating defeats in its history at the hands of a small , improvised army of Chechen guerrillas , Russia last week was once again in a state of undeclared war with the mountainous republic . And the conflict is about to escalate dramatically . The first Russian ground forces have crossed the frontier , thrusting into two northern Chechen districts , while Russian commandos  --  the Spetsnaz  --  are reportedly moving into the northeast . In keeping with the best traditions of Soviet propaganda , Moscow announced that " the local people " in several Chechen districts are rising up against Islamic extremists . An estimated 50,000 to 60,000 additional Russian troops are massed on Chechnya 's borders , awaiting the order to move . Overhead , Russian warplanes continued the systematic destruction of Chechnya 's communications and bridges . Late last week Russian air force commander General Anatoly Kornukov said he needed a week to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden diplomatic breakthrough , a major ground war is about to explode . The Russian military has clamped tight censorship on its operations , but political leaders have difficulty containing their glee at the prospect of hitting back at the unruly , predominately Islamic state that has been infuriating them for the past five years . Officially , they have been goaded past endurance by alleged Chechen acts of terrorism , including the spectacular bombings of four apartment buildings in Moscow and elsewhere last month . But Chechnya 's determination to secede from Russia is equally a target . When asked about Russian incursions into Chechnya , Prime Minister Vladimir Putin , the latest in President Boris Yeltsin 's revolving cast of legislative leaders , gave a sinister little smile and explained that the term incursion did n't apply . " We do n't have a border with Chechnya , " he said . " Chechnya is part of the Russian Federation . " In the Chechen capital of Grozny , guerrilla leader Shamil Basayev displayed his own brand of black humor , calling for a massive hole to be dug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city in preparation for a new pile of Russian corpses . <P> In Washington the Clinton Administration is following events with alarm . " We have asked the Russians to clarify their actions and intentions , " says State Department spokesman James Rubin , adding that the U.S. is urging constructive dialogue on both sides . The use of force , he says , " will make dialogue that much harder to occur . " <P> There was something wildly irrational in the Kremlin 's thinking , starting with the notion that a second Chechnya war would be more winnable than the first one . Three years ago , a demoralized and disastrously led Russian army was savaged by Chechnya 's hastily assembled guerrillas . The only obvious difference now is that there are more Chechen fighters . Since the bloody debacle of 1994- ' 96 , the Russian army 's disintegration has continued . Budget cuts and corruption have undermined its strength and reduced training to a bare minimum , while morale has dropped even lower . But by some bizarre process of mental alchemy , the top Russian brass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
