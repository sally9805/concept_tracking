<p> The Jeff George fiasco keeps getting crazier by the day . <p> George , the Indianapolis quarterback who is being fined $ 4,000 per day for not reporting to training camp , wants to be traded because he does n't believe he is appreciated enough in his hometown . <p> George , who always has been considered something of a baby , says the fans have been too tough on him . But what 's happened in the past will be nothing compared to the reception he will get if he has to play for the Colts . <p> Indianapolis is coming off a 9-7 season , and the fans and players are excited about the season . The George controversy has put a damper on some of the preseason enthusiasm . <p> George 's teammates have criticized him on numerous occasions . <p> " " I 'm just sick and tired of that question , " defensive end Steve Emtman says . " " It 's not a problem . We 're not having a problem with him right now . Jack ( Trudeau ) is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a guy on the team that is too full of himself to be a part of the team , then we 'd rather not have him , anyway . <p> " " He 's ( George ) got a lot of ability . He 's got Pro Bowl ability , but he does n't have a Pro Bowl attitude as far as I 'm concerned . I think we 're better off with a guy with not as much ability with better leadership . " Sources close to the Colts say a resolution is in the works to either get George into camp or traded . He makes $ 2.16 million this season . The Buccaneers , Raiders , Bears and Vikings are showing the most interest . <p> Meanwhile , the George watch continues in Indianapolis . He has stayed out of sight but not out of mind . One popular T-shirt has pictures of Elvis and George on the front with the caption , " " If you 've seen one of these guys , please call the Indianapolis police . " <p> Another T-shirt has George 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a sandbox and crying . The caption reads , " " My mommy wo n't let me go to camp . " <p> Disc jockeys on morning shows and talk shows in the evenings are crucifying George . One restaurant advertises a wine called " " Jeff George Fine Whine . " <p> If offensive tackle David Williams , running back Lorenzo White and defensive tackle Jeff Alm end their holdouts as expected this week , the Oilers will have all players under contract before training camp ends for the first time in more than 10 years . <p> All three players expect to make big contributions this season , and they know they need to play in two preseason games to be ready for the regular season . <p> When Oilers scout C.O. Brocato left the dormitory for his early-morning run one day last week , he was surprised to find rookie Le'Shai Maston at the desk in the lobby . <p> " " It was about 4:45 when I went out to run , " Brocato said . <p> " " There 's usually nobody up except the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I asked him what he was doing up so early . He told me he could n't sleep , so he decided to come down early and study his playbook . " <p> The night before , the former Baylor star had been told by the coaches that he was being moved from running back to defense . He was so nervous he could n't eat dinner , and then he could n't sleep . <p> " " My head was just spinning because I had to learn another playbook , " Maston said about being up so early . " " I was worried that I would n't be able to get it all down . " <p> Word is spreading around the league that the Redskins asked outside linebacker Wilber Marshall to have arthroscopic knee surgery in the offseason , but he refused . The inference is that the Oilers got damaged goods . <p> The Oilers gave Marshall two physical examinations before they signed him to the $ 2.75-million contract . He suffered the injury during a practice drill in which he was playing special teams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as new by the start of the season . <p> And why was Marshall playing special teams ? It was a situation where he was getting some instruction in case he ever had to do it because of injuries to other players . <p> When Emmitt Smith was drafted , the Cowboys said he was the best back in the draft , so his agents wanted him to be paid like Blair Thomas , the second player selected . The Cowboys refused , saying that Smith should be slotted and paid according to the spot he was drafted . <p> Now that Smith has won two rushing titles and led the Cowboys to a Super Bowl victory , his agents are saying to slot him in front of or behind Thurman Thomas , but Dallas is offering $ 4.4 million less than the Bills gave their running back . The Cowboys have offered $ 9.1 million for four years . <p> Interesting comments in Eagles Digest . The weekly newspaper that is sponsored by the team did an interview with owner Norman Braman , who did n't have many nice things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed with Green Bay . <p> " " I knew , despite the nonsense that was percolating about Reggie White , that it was dollars and cents all the time , " Braman said . " " The press , the geniuses in the media in Philadelphia , swallowed all the malarkey about Reggie wanting to be in the ghetto , and that God was doing the directing . I understood the reality : Reggie White was going to go where the money was best . " <p> Chicago defensive tackle Steve McMichael has a chance to set some team records this season . If McMichael , 35 , plays in 12 games , he will beat Walter Payton 's record of appearing in 186 consecutive games . If McMichael plays in all 16 games , he will have played in 191 , more than any player in the 73-year history of the franchise . <p> A change of scenery has given receiver Irving Fryar a new outlook . The trade from New England to Miami and the opportunity work with quarterback Dan Marino has made Fryar feel like a rookie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it 's the youngest I 've felt in my career , " he says . " " I feel like I 'm a rookie all over again . " <p> With the Patriots , Fryar played with a number of quarterbacks over the years . Now he feels like he died and went to heaven . <p> " " He ( Marino ) does n't throw the ball any harder than anybody else , " Fryar says . " " He 's just a smart quarterback . He knows defenses . He knows when to throw the ball and how to get it between people . <p> " " Receiving a pass from him does n't feel any different . The difference is when it gets there . " <p> The odds are against Minnesota quarterback Jim McMahon lasting a full season . No big surprise there since the injury-prone McMahon has survived only one full season during his first 11 years in the league . <p> Not only did the Vikings lose center Kirk Lowdermilk and guard Brian Habib as unrestricted free agents , but Pro Bowl tackle Gary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he signed last year . The Vikings have put Zimmerman on the market because they do n't want to pay him $ 2 million per year . <p> San Francisco quarterback Steve Young signed a new five-year contract worth $ 26.75 million . Young automatically gives 10 percent to the Morman Church . But Young has decided to give even more to the church , and that does n't count another million he has given to various causes in recent years . <p> Add the $ 47-million-plus contract center Shawn Bradley signed with the NBA 's Philadelphia 76ers , and that 's quite a contribution to the Mormans from only two professional athletes . <p> The NFC East wins Super Bowls , but the NFC West had the best record in the league last season . In games against non-division opponents , the NFC West posted a .650 winning percentage , best in the league . The worst division was the NFC Central , which was .375 . <p> For what it 's worth , the only NFC Central team to ever win a Super Bowl was Chicago after the 1985 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cleveland defensive tackle Michael Dean Perry . Because of injuries , the three starters in the defensive line are ends Keith Hamilton and Mark Flythe and nose tackle Stacey Dillard . <p> The Browns were n't interested . <p> When San Francisco played in Barcelona , coach George Seifert saw a woman sunbathing topless at the hotel pool . <p> " " I was embarrassed , and I did n't go back , " Seifert said . <p> " " I was embarrassed I could n't stop looking at her . " <p> Former linebacker Matt Millen , who now works as a CBS analyst , on the Los Angeles fans : " " The trouble with Los Angeles fans is that you can be trailing by six points in the fourth quarter and driving for the winning touchdown . Then someone yells " Surf 's up , ' and everyone leaves the stadium . " <p> NOTES : John McClain covers the Oilers and the National Football League for the Chronicle .
