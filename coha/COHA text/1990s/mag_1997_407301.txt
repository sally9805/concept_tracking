Fighting the Good You know it 's coming . But you tell yourself that tonight will be easier . I 'll do something different and it will all come together . " Cathy Romano is talking about bedtime in her house . Romano and her husband Randy , of Buckhorn , Ontario , have four children between the ages of four and ten , and getting them to bed is a prime source of conflict in the family . It starts when we say , " It 's time for bed , " and they collapse on the couch or say , " l do n't waaannnt to ! ' ' " says Romano . " The other night I got so mad I yelled , " I do n't care what Barbara Coloroso says about stickers ! We 're doing stickers ! ' I grabbed a piece of paper and sat down determined to come up with a sticker and reward system that would make bedtime easier . " In the end , Romano abandoned the sticker idea as unworkable . But it was indicative of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battles with their children . It might be getting up in the morning instead of going to bed at night , or mealtime , or chores , or fights between siblings , but chances are that if you hang around with any family , you 'll see some conflict before long . Are we talking about dysfunction ? Not really  --  conflict is part of life . There is virtually no way that human beings ( or any creatures for that matter ) can go through life without having to deal with conflict . In other words , it comes with the territory , especially for parents . But that does n't mean we ever learn to like it . It wrings me out like a towel , " says Romano . " And sometimes , after a particularly bad night , when the kids are finally asleep and they look like such angels , I feel so guilty . Things come out of my mouth that I knew I 'd never say before I had children . " Sound familiar ? Actually , the news is not all bad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some battles with our kids ( more about that later ) , but there 's also a positive side to conflict . To begin with , it helps to develop and shape a child 's sense of autonomy and control . " Part of growing up is learning how to separate yourself from parental demands and develop your own ideas . Some degree of conflict is necessary in order for children to be able to do that , " says Joan Grusec , a psychologist at the University of Toronto . Romano agrees . " We try and raise our children to be able to say " no , " to be able to assert themselves , " she says . " Unfortunately , we do n't always like the way they test that ability with us , but really , if I had a child who I never fought with , I 'd be concerned . " In addition , according to Grusec , " working through conflict with parents is one of the key ways that children learn rules and acquire values . " When we take a stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we let them know what is really important to us . And how a family handles these clashes presents a model of how to deal with them in the world . " Children will have to deal with conflict in their lives , " says Leon Kuczynski , a psychologist at the University of Guelph . " The home is the best place to learn how to do it constructively . " Kuczynksi 's research monitoring the interactions between mothers and young children has shown that , even at the age of two , the strategies that a child uses in situations of non - compliance ( where the child does n't want to do what the parent wants ) are related to the techniques used by the parent . If the parent relies on force , the child tends to use angry defiance . When the parent uses suggestions and reasoning , the child is more likely to use negotiation . Last but not least , strife can actually help us connect with our kids , according to U.S. psychologist Ron Taffel , who devotes an entire chapter to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examples ( taken from his practice ) where parents strengthened their bond with their children after a " battle " of some kind . As he explains , " It is the continuous hassling , haggling , adjusting , readjusting , negotiating , compromising , problem - solving and decision - making that go into finding the right kind of connection between you and your child . " True as that may be , it 's still not easy to feel good about parent - child discord . Ask Nan Moffat ( not her real name ) . Her son Joe , a bright , inquisitive and very active six - year - old , has put her through her paces more than once . When Joe was three I had a part - time job and I often had a hard time getting him home from the babysitter just across the street . Of course , it was just as hard to get him there too . One day , it must have been about the tenth time in a row , I had to carry him , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , I 'd just had it . When we got in the door I just let it rip . I put him down on the floor  --  probably a bit harder than I should have  --  and started yelling . " Joe , I 'm really mad . You always kick and scream , it 's embarrassing , we ca n't say goodbye properly and I 'm just sick to death of it ! ' There was another time when I actually hit Joe , which is something I do n't believe in and thought I 'd never do . I was trying to change his diaper and he was kicking and struggling and he kicked me right in the face . I do have this temper and I see red sometimes . Well , this time I whacked him right on the butt ! Of course , I immediately felt awful  --  I was a horrible parent , I could n't deal with my son . " Do n't we all find ourselves in this position ? We 've lost it , and we do something we swore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insult or scream in our child 's face . These are the darkest moments of parenting and yet , even here there is a silver lining . Dr. Paul Steinhauer , a staff psychiatrist at Toronto 's Hospital for Sick Children , assures us that children can survive these occasional episodes with their mental health intact . Not only that , they can come out of it stronger if we handle things right . " Parents do n't have to be perfect if , on the whole , they are caring , involved and reasonable . But , if you 've lost it and say or do things you regret , then after things have calmed down , acknowledge to the child that you 've been wrong , say you 're sorry and reassure her that you still love her . " Steinhauer refers to this as " reconstituting the relationship . " It 's an important skill for parents and children to develop together . Nan Moffat has had those moments . " When I 'd lost it with Joe , yelled at him or whatever , he would always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes . Eventually we 'd have this big reconciliation  --  " I 'm so sorry we had that big argument '  --  and there 'd be hugs and kisses . I was always amazed that he was able to process those things . He seemed to understand , and he was able to forgive me . Now at the age of six , he will often come to me first after an argument and say , " I 'm sorry about the milk , " or whatever . I feel good about that . " But why do we get so mad at our kids in the first place ? Does n't it seem like we reserve a level of anger for them that we do n't lay on anybody else ? I think the overwhelming love I feel for Joe has something to do with it , " says Moffat . " I mean , I just adore him . I think he 's wonderful . But somehow that makes the anger that I feel more overwhelming too . This is a passionate relationship . You 're not going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " Steinhauer adds that while we want to avoid these blow - ups as much as possible , it 's wrong for parents to back away from all confrontations . " Usually , the family where there is no conflict is one where either issues are being ducked or angry feelings are suppressed . Neither is good , " he says . " When anger is suppressed kids never get a chance to learn to handle it constructively , and anger that is suppressed may work its way out in deviant or oppositional ways . " So in the end , we have to accept that we will fight with our children sometimes , we need to fight constructively as much as possible , and we need to forgive ourselves , and our kids , for doing it . Actually , we can learn from our children  --  they often roll with the ups and downs of family life better than parents do . Remember Cathy Romano and her bedtime battles ? When she was thinking about what she was going to say about this subject , she decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I asked them , " What do we have conflict about ? ' They looked at me as if I was crazy . " Conflict ? We do n't fight about anything ! ' ' " RESOURCES Parenting by Heart , by Ron Taffel with Melinda Blau , Addison - Wesley , 1991 . This book rethinks many of the widely held " truths " about parenting and deals head - on ( and reassuringly ) with its conflicts and contradictions . Love and Anger , by Nancy Samalin with Catherine Whitney , Viking , 1991 . Samalin , a parent educator , takes a compassionate look at parental anger , offering many practical suggestions and real - life anecdotes . CONFLICT ADVICE Even though we 've learned how normal and " valuable " conflict can be , we 'd still probably like to keep it down to a dull roar . Here are some proven strategies . Offer choices . Who 's sick of hearing about choices ? OK ! OK ! But the fact is , it 's a simple technique that often works with toddlers and preschoolers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can offer kids a bit of control over the details ( which story they would like to hear ) it will likely head off a conflict you do n't wish to have about the main issue ( that it 's time for bed ) . Do n't sweat the small stuff . Parents need to know the difference between a mountain and a molehill . Does it really matter that your three - year - old wants to go outside with no mittens as long as he can come back inside and get them if he needs them ? In any situation , ask yourself : Is anybody going to get hurt ( emotionally or physically ) ? Might something get broken ? If not , it may not be worth the trouble of a drawn - out negotiation or argument . Avoid acting in the heat of the moment . If you have a recurring source of conflict , say mealtime , it can be helpful to sit down with your child ( or have a family meeting ) at a time when all of you are in a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ask your child for ideas , or brainstorm together . Obviously , this depends on your child 's age ; in the case of a toddler , you might have to do the brainstorming with your spouse or a friend . Plan ahead . The reasons why we need things to happen are not as obvious to kids as they are to us . So sometimes parents need to explain in advance . " Jimmy , we have to pick up your sister at nursery school , so you can listen to two more songs , but then we have to go . " That kind of information both respects the child 's need to know what 's going on and may help you avoid the conflict that might occur if you said , out of the blue , " Get your coat , we 're going . " Model fair fighting . It 's OK to get mad . It 's what we do in angry moments that can be the problem . If you 're so mad that you ca n't behave constructively , the best thing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk right now , " and remove yourself for a brief time until you can regain some control . Look for ways to show your child examples of good conflict resolution  --  expressing concerns calmly without insults ; negotiation ; and finding a solution . This can come from the way you handle disagreements with your spouse or by discussing conflicts you resolved at work or in your extended family . LOVE MEANS SOMETIMES HAVING TO SAY YOU 'RE SORRY The day my perfect record came to a halt was just an ordinary day . I wish I could say that the washer had overflowed , or the kids had thrown a rock through the window , or I 'd had a flat tire on the way home from swimming lessons with a carload of groceries and three wet , whiny kids . These things all happened , but not that day . It was just a regular day at home with my three sons . I blew my top over some trivial little thing . I ca n't even remember what . Maybe the kids had left toys lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrestling moves on each other , or maybe they had run in the house with muddyboots . Whatever it was , I lost my cool and hollered at all three kids till I was red in the face . Then I sent them up to their bedroom . After that moment every detail is clearly etched in my memory . The boys made their way quietly to their room and I sat down , closed my eyes and counted to ten , trying to calm my rattled nerves . I suddenly had visions of their confused little faces staring innocently up at me as I was yelling at them , wondering why Mommy was flipping out . My heart was instantly filled with guilt . The feeling was n't new to me , but I 'd always managed to quell it in the past . Not this time . Out of nowhere  --  I say this because it is so unnatural for me  --  it occurred to me that I should apologize . The idea surprised me at first , then it frightened me . Admit to my kids that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no use trying to fight it . The thought had surfaced from its safe hideaway in my subconscious and it could n't be ignored . I took a deep breath , gathered my courage and climbed the stairs . The boys were sitting on the floor in their room playing quietly with dinky cars . I felt suddenly shy . I forced myself to look them each in the eye . Guys , " I said softly , " I 'm sorry . " Three shocked faces stared at me . You guys did n't do anything wrong . I should n't have yelled . I 'm sorry I flipped out . " Scott , my three - year - old , smiled happily and gave me a hug . Michael , my five - year - old , said , " That 's OK , Mom , " and returned his attention to the cars . Jack , the oldest at six , seemed to understand how momentous an occasion this was . He stared at me for a few moments , accepting my apology with a silent nod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was something else in his eyes as well , something quite unexpected . Respect . It was my turn to be shocked . I could hardly believe it . I had admitted I was wrong and instead of losing face , I had gained my sons ' respect . It 's been seven years since that incident . These days I average maybe half a dozen apologies a year . I 'd say I 'm batting .500 since I 'm only wrong about 12 times a year ( my kids ' statistics might be slightly different ) . Saying I 'm sorry to my children is still difficult . The more you love someone , the more difficult it is . But the more you love someone , the more necessary it is . And I 've learned that my kids ' respect does not come from being a perfect parent . It comes from admitting that I 'm not . - Carmen Walton TROUBLE SIGNS Parent - child conflict can be a sign that something is very wrong . In general , according to Toronto psychiatrist Paul Steinhauer , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem really bugging them ? Do the conflicts ever get resolved ? And is everybody feeling more or less OK about the way they are resolved , or are there lingering bad feelings ? There 's good conflict and bad conflict , " says Dr. Steinhauer . " In bad conflict people just get madder and more frustrated . In good conflict , the issue gets resolved and the relationship is reconstituted . " Another sign of unresolved conflict is that both parent and child feel bad . " The kids react as if they 're being put down and the parents feel that they 're being persecuted , " notes Steinhauer . A child who is constantly caught up in this kind of turmoil may become discouraged , resentful and more difficult to handle . " If the conflicts are constant or if parent and child are really starting to dislike each other , then it makes sense to seek outside assistance in working things out , " says Steinhauer . It need n't always be a professional . Friends and extended family  --  anybody whose judgement you trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation as you are  --  can be very helpful .
