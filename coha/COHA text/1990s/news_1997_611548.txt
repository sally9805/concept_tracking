<p> Mary Treadwell , an employee of the D.C. mayor 's office who served 15 months in federal prison on a 1983 fraud conviction , " improperly diverted " and has not accounted for more than $ 10,000 allocated by the District for community services , according to a report released yesterday by the D.C. auditor . <p> Treadwell , who was married to Mayor Marion Barry from 1972 to 1977 and who holds a $ 58,378-a-year job in the mayor 's Office of Policy , also heads an Advisory Neighborhood Commission in her Columbia Heights neighborhood . An audit of the volunteer agency found that $ 10,900 , paid by the ANC to a local lawyer in 1995 , later was transferred to Treadwell in checks written over a six-month period . <p> " The entire $ 10,900 appears to be diverted , " said Auditor Anthony Cooper . " The bottom line is there 's a big question mark as to what happened to the money when it was transferred to Ms. Treadwell . " <p> Cooper said an additional $ 8,000 could not be accounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , " he said . " We need to go back and ask , ' Where 's the money ? ' We know there 's $ 8,000 out there somewhere . " <p> Treadwell , 55 , was convicted in 1983 of conspiring to defraud the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the residents of Clifton Terrace , an apartment complex for low-income people that she managed in Northwest Washington . She served 15 months of a three-year prison sentence for taking the tenants ' money for her own use . She was fined $ 40,000 , which was suspended . <p> Treadwell went to work for the D.C. government after her release , first for the parole board and more recently for the mayor 's office . She has served on the ANC for six years , the last four as its chairman . <p> The District 's 37 ANCs were created in 1974 under the Home Rule Charter , whose authors envisioned the elected volunteers serving as advisers to the mayor and the D.C. Council . Although the charter specified that great weight should be given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence generally has been minimal . <p> Until 1996 , when the commissions ' annual allotments were halved , the ANCs received anywhere from $ 5,000 to $ 54,000 a year in city funding , based on the number of residents they served . Treadwell 's ANC , the city 's second-largest , received $ 185,000 over more than three years ending in December . <p> Cooper said he would refer his audit to federal investigators . <p> " We ended our audit where the paper trail ended , but there are a number of questionable activities that my staff does not have the resources to follow through , " he said . <p> Although the audit does not mention him by name , lawyer Larry C. Williams received the $ 10,900 in two checks written on the ANC account and signed by the ANC 's officers . Williams , a longtime Barry ally who said Treadwell asked him to hold the money for administrative purposes , said in an interview that Treadwell later came to his office several times and asked him to make out checks in her name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in amounts of $ 4,900 , $ 1,500 , $ 2,000 and $ 2,000  --  to The Washington Post yesterday . All were made out to and endorsed by Mary M. Treadwell . A fifth check for $ 500 was written to a community group . <p> " She made withdrawals until she withdrew all the funds , " Williams said . <p> Treadwell did not respond to several telephone calls to her office and home yesterday . <p> In an interview last week , Treadwell said she would be vindicated because she never signs checks from the commission . Treadwell said she recognized that her " vulnerabilities " made her an easy target since she had served time in prison . <p> Cooper 's auditors said the ANC 's financial records were shoddy , even though it paid a certified public accountant about $ 8,500 over the last three years . The commission 's checkbook balances went unrecorded for months , sometimes as long as a year , the audit said . <p> " I was surprised at the level and depth of deficiencies and their inability to balance the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guidelines , " Cooper said . <p> Records obtained by The Post and confirmed by the audit found : <p> The ANC has spent more than $ 185,000 since 1994 , according to its quarterly reports . <p> Most of the money  --  $ 108,000  --  was spent in 1995 . That year , purchases of services from the office helper for the certified public accountant cost nearly $ 33,000 , almost double what was spent in 1994 and nearly three times the amount spent last year . <p> The proper payroll taxes were not deducted from ANC employees ' paychecks . Antoinette " Tony " Bowler , an office helper who was paid as much as $ 3,200 a month , was treated as an independent contractor . If it is discovered that the appropriate taxes were not paid , the ANC could be liable for the taxes and interest , the audit said . <p> The commission gave out grants for $ 20,000 in 1995 , compared with less than $ 6,000 in 1994 and less than $ 3,000 in 1996 . <p> The commission paid $ 500 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cooper said no records were found during the audit to explain that expenditure , which the ANC 's June 1995 quarterly report listed as a printing expense . It is still under investigation . <p> The Post found that the ANC had authorized hiring a law firm to draw up guidelines to administer grants . Two checks were written to Williams 's law firm , $ 3,500 and $ 7,400 . Both checks referred to the Banneker Recreation Project , a proposal to build a sports complex near Howard University that never got off the ground . <p> Williams said Treadwell asked the law firm to hold the money for the project because she was directing the funds and wanted to create a paper trail . He said his law firm does not write grants . <p> " We did absolutely no work whatsoever , and we received no fee whatsoever , " Williams said . " The two checks that were given for deposit totaled $ 10,900 , and my disbursements totaled $ 10,900 . We accepted no funds . " <p> According to interviews and records obtained from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Banneker project , a move spearheaded by then-D.C . Council member Bill Lightfoot ( I-At Large ) for a state-of-the-art sports recreational complex within the ANC 's boundaries . <p> Of the money that went to Williams , $ 2,400 was intended to pay for supplies the community activists needed to oppose the project , according to Lawrence T. Guyot , a longtime ANC member who was familiar with the transaction . Guyot said the LeDroit Park and Pleasant Plains civic associations were to have received $ 1,200 each . <p> Darren Jones , president of the Pleasant Plains Civic Association , said his organization never received a $ 1,200 grant as part of the Banneker project . Instead , he said , it received $ 500 to send some children to summer camp . The checks in Williams 's office confirmed that Pleasant Plains was the only recipient of a check other than Treadwell . <p> Lightfoot said he dropped the idea for the sports center after two community meetings , including one with the commission . There was never any need for pickets , he said . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , I 'll take it somewhere else , ' " Lightfoot said . " I do n't know what they spent money on . " <p> The commission gave out grants for $ 20,000 in 1995 , far more than in 1994 and 1996 . Many of the grants were not approved by a quorum of commissioners , according to the audit . <p> The commission also spent more than $ 5,500 on telephone bills , with the fees totaling a little more than $ 2,000 for two straight years . <p> Cooper announced recently that he will audit all 37 ANCs , which receive more than a half-million dollars in annual allotments from the D.C. government to improve their communities . <p> Metro Resource Director Margot Williams contributed to this report .
