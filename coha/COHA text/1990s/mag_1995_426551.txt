Section : What 's Behind the Sales Pitch <p> Americans with government or job-based health insurance  --  which means most of us  --  will soon be learning a new vocabulary , and a set of confusing acronyms to go with it . We 'll also be facing dramatic changes in the way we get our health care , including some that could be extremely hazardous to our health . <p> The new wave in health care delivery is something called " managed care , " which has grown prodigiously in the private sector , and is currently being promoted as a cure for the fiscal ills of Medicare , Medicaid , and governmental budgets . This comes in several sizes , but the basic model is the health maintenance organization , or HMO . Similar but different in certain key respects is the PPO  --  " preferred provider organization . " Whatever the variations , the basic principles are the same , and need to be understood by anyone enrolling in such a program . <p> In essence , managed care tries to reverse the incentives of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providers get reimbursed according to what they do  --  how many patients they treat , how many tests and procedures are performed , and so on . Under managed care , providers are often paid a fixed amount regardless of the work performed , thereby creating incentives toward economy . Doctors paid this way have strong reasons to be frugal , since cost overruns occur at their expense , while anything that is n't spent they get to keep . This creates some obvious incentives for care denial , as discussed below . Again , with variations , HMOs are the purest form of this arrangement . <p> Confronted with high and rising costs for health care , governments and employers have turned increasingly to managed care to solve the problem , shepherding ever-larger numbers of people into such programs . As of year-end 1994 , total HMO enrollments stood at 51.1 million , and are expected to reach almost 60 million in the next two years . An especially fertile source of new enrollments is Medicaid , where the numbers in managed care jumped 63% in 1994 , and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count , more than one-fifth of Medicare enrollees are in such programs , and strenuous efforts are being made to sign up others . All of which means that , if you have n't been asked to join an HMO in one or another of these formats , it 's likely that you will . <p> If you are asked to enroll in an HMO or other managed care arrangement , you need to raise some searching questions . One such is what , exactly , you will be getting if you join , and what exactly you will be giving up . Another is whether the up-front advertising matches the fine print that is n't in the sales pitch . Above all , you should find out if you will be able to get life-saving treatment when you may urgently need it  --  and , most important , who will be making this decision . <p> Obvious danger signs in this regard are the growing number of press accounts alleging care denial by HMOs or inadequate treatment of their patients , as might be expected from the incentives of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where HMOs have long been part of the health care landscape . In one case , the state Commissioner of Corporations fined an HMO $500,000 for denying an expensive operation to an eleven-year-old girl , thereby " putting in jeopardy the life of a young patient . " In another , a jury awarded an $89 million judgment against an HMO that denied a bone-marrow transplant ( the patient died ) . <p> In Florida , newspaper exposes of Medicaid-HMO abuse caused the state to freeze enrollments in the program . The Florida Sun-Sentinel reported serious problems with quality of care and other irregularities . Tennessee , where the whole Medicaid population was put in HMOs almost overnight , has been rife with problems , as HMOs refused to pay the bills for patients who showed up at emergency rooms ( a violation of managed care procedure ) . Similar troubles have developed in New York . Charges of care denial among Medicare recipients are likewise growing . ( See " Medicare HMOs : Seniors At Risk , " page 12 . ) <p> While these accounts are anecdotal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies are beginning to take a closer look at quality outcomes in the work of HMOs . Among the most revealing of such surveys is a recent report of the Inspector General of the federal Health and Human Services Department . This reviewed the experience of more than 4,000 Medicare patients in HMOs , including those who were still enrolled and others who had dropped out , expressing dissatisfaction with the system . Among the findings : <p> " In at least 58% of the HMOs , from 11% to over 50% of the beneficiaries said they waited more than 12 days for a scheduled appointment with their primary care doctor . For scheduled appointments with a specialist , disenrollees indicated longer waits . . . . In more than one-third of the HMOs , from 11% to 50% of beneficiaries said consistently busy telephone lines caused them sometimes to give up scheduling an appointment . . . . In 52% of HMOs , from 11% to 50% of disenrollees said their doctors sometimes failed to refer them to a specialist when needed . . . . In 40% of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical care they received from their HMO caused their health to worsen . " <p> Follow the Money . To understand the genesis of these problems , one needs to grasp the peculiar finances of the health care system . As health economists are agreed , the major source of the spending spiral is third-party payment , in which someone other than the patient picks up the tab for care . Since patients and providers in this setup have little incentive to conserve on costs , other agencies step in to do it . Strenuous efforts in this regard have been made by federal health officials , through price controls , cutbacks on reimbursements , limits on hospital stays , and other methods . All of this means denying care to patients , but has had little effect in curtailing total outlays . ( See " Denying Health Care to the Elderly , " CR , July 1992 . ) <p> It is because these methods have fallen short that policy-makers have turned to HMOs . In this as in other schemes of price control and rationing , two contrary tendencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the HMO attempts to push it down . The effect is like putting a lid on a boiling kettle , or trying to wiggle into last year 's suit after you 've gained 50 pounds . When such conflicting forces clash , something has to give , and in this case that 's likely to be the welfare of the patient . <p> Again , to fathom the workings of the system , and what it means to you , follow the money . It starts with the way that doctors are reimbursed , usually a salary or a " capitation " fee  --  paying a certain amount per patient assigned to a physician , whether or not that patient comes in for treatment . As more and more people go into managed care , this means that HMOs become a major source of doctors ' income . It also creates a pool of dollars which , if spent on other things , is no longer there for doctors ' reimbursements . <p> The doctor to whom the patients are assigned is supposed to deal with all their health needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specialists , sent to the hospital , or undergo some costly operation . This doctor is the " gatekeeper " of the system ( a significant term that HMOs are now trying to avoid ) ; if you do n't go through him , you do n't get health care , or  --  more to the point  --  the HMO wo n't pay for it . ( This has proved a major source of confusion for Medicaid patients recruited to the system . ) <p> Quite obviously , the main incentive for cost containment in this set-up is that , if the doctor does refer the patient for expensive care , the cost comes out of his pocket . To make the point crystal clear , many HMOs employ a " withhold " or bonus system , in which a certain amount of money is set aside , to be disbursed to doctors who are judged the most cost-effective . ( According to the Physician Payment Review Commission , some two-thirds of HMOs surveyed use some version of these incentives . ) On the face of it , this poses a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you ; in essence , it pits the financial interest of the physician against the medical interest of the patient . <p> The rationale for this approach is that there is a lot of waste and " unnecessary care " in the system , and that putting an external lid on costs will fix this . Given the third-party payment method , the charge of excessive care seems true enough ; that HMOs can provide the answer seems a good deal less so . Indeed , because they actually increase third-party payment ( at least for various routine procedures ) , they add to the general problem of demand ; meanwhile , however , the external pressure they clamp on the expanding system can wind up denying care that may be quite necessary from your standpoint , but expensive  --  the great taboo of managed care . <p> What Is n't Being Said . That HMOs should be aggressively recruiting patients may seem odd , given all the complaining about costs , but this results from other wrinkles in the system . Although governments and corporations spend large amounts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  only a small percentage of these need costly care at any given moment . In 1992 , for instance , more than half of all Medicare enrollees had payments of $500 or less , far below the average individual premium . Any insurer who could sign up these people would have a lot more money coming in than going out . <p> In the case of Medicare enrollees , HMOs contract to take them off the government 's hands at 95% of the per capita outlay , which at first blush sounds like a good deal to officials trying to control expenses . In fact , however , the vast majority of these enrollees cost far less than 95% of the average outlay . The evidence is that these have been predominantly the people going into HMOs , thus securing the operators a tidy profit . <p> Spokesmen for HMOs deny that they are trying to " cherry pick " the system , but the recruitment methods being used , and analyses by the Congressional Budget Office , indicate that better risks have been selected . Recruiting sessions for Medicare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selecting seniors who are relatively healthy and more mobile ; inducements to attend such sessions often include free dance tickets , not much use to bed-ridden or ailing patients ; in some cases , recruitment sessions are held on the second floor of these locations , a convenient way of spotting or discouraging the feeble . ( One ironic result of this approach is that resort to HMOs has wound up costing Medicare more than would have the previous system , since it 's paying almost full price for healthier seniors while still having to foot the bill for sicker patients . ) <p> Over time , of course , such methods do n't entirely prevent the ailing or feeble from showing up in managed care ; as enrollments grow and people age , more such will be included in the system . When this occurs , a second and more forbidding line of defense comes into play  --  which is to contest , delay , and deny expensive care whenever feasible , by a host of baffling methods . This is the maximum danger zone for patients , who need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is n't being said in the recruiting sessions . <p> Seniors and others approached by HMOs do ask questions , of course , but usually these are n't sufficient . A common inquiry is , " can I keep my own doctor ? " This is the right question , but it does n't go nearly far enough . What patients need to know is something more specific : Even if I can keep my doctor , what will he be allowed to do for me ? Will he be able to prescribe the treatment that I need , according to his best medical judgment ? The answer to that question , on the available record , is far from reassuring . <p> In HMO promotions , great stress is laid on free or low-cost benefits , minimal fees for doctor visits , the absence of co-payments , and the like . Here , for instance , is the list of benefits promised seniors by one major HMO : " No Medicare deductibles . Affordable co-payments . Unlimited hospital stays when medically necessary . Emergency care anywhere in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Routine physical exams ( preventive health services ) . Prescription drug discounts . Dental coverage . Vision coverage . " <p> Such appeals are persuasive to many seniors , who naturally would like to be relieved of these expenses . Note , however , that the matters stressed are mostly routine and relatively cheap , with little being said about major treatment , and that little is ambiguous . The kicker is the innocent-sounding phrase , " when medically necessary , " which suggests that more expensive services will be provided . But who decides what is " medically necessary " ? And how is this decided ? At this level , the answers range from vague to scary . <p> A frequent complaint against HMOs is lack of disclosure about their methods . ( Susan Rosenfeld , former general counsel to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center , who herself became a cancer patient , observes that " HMOs do n't like to give information to prospective patients . " ) Nevertheless , some things are known about HMO guidelines and procedures , and it 's easy to see why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recent account in The New York Times , profiling a large consulting firm that furnishes guidelines to HMOs for deciding what services should be paid for . <p> One guideline , for example , stated that a patient needing cataract surgery was entitled to have only one eye corrected , unless it could be proved that the individual actually needed use of both . ( This has since been rescinded . ) The consulting firm that proposed this also came up with guidelines for one Blue Cross/Blue Shield insurer , recommending that someone whose leg was amputated above the knee was entitled to two days in the hospital , that a mother should leave the hospital 12 hours after giving birth , that a patient receiving bypass surgery should leave in four days , and so on . ( These guidelines ranged from one-half to one-eighth of existing national average hospital stays for such cases . ) <p> As for general attitude toward patients , the Times account goes on : " For proposed operations ranging from hip replacements to tonsillectomies to heart surgery , the consultant recommends refusals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other treatments have failed . To save on specialists , generalists are told to handle most epileptic seizures , pneumonia , chronic bronchitis , sprains , tonsillitis , heart failure , herpes , diabetes , thyroid disorders , arthritis , and hemorrhoids . " ( Italics added . ) The literature on managed care , as suggested in various sidebars to this article , is rife with such examples , all geared to cost as the decisive factor . <p> Doctors in a Bind . While the mindset and methods suggested here should be frightening to patients , they are also worrisome to physicians . Medical journals and the mainstream press have carried numerous stories about doctors who intensely dislike the system , and say the incentives created by it pose serious ethical problems . A recent report from the American Medical Association states the issues clearly , with principal focus on incentives toward denying care . ( See box , adjoining . ) Such concerns have attracted little public sympathy , however , since they are put down to the self-interest of the doctors , rather than being looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors , moreover , are in a bind , which becomes increasingly tight as managed care expands . As HMOs enroll their millions , doctors must sign up if they want to have customers for their wares ( or else devise their own arrangements for managed care in order to compete ) . And once they do sign up , they not only depend on HMOs or other managed care promoters for a large part of their income , but are subject to the contractual limits of the system . ( In some cases , these include " gag orders " that prevent physicians from saying anything adverse about the program . ) <p> Even under these compulsions , doctors trained to do everything they can for patients may be inclined to incur higher costs in certain cases , and further safeguards are sometimes added to prevent this . As an additional barrier against referrals , there may be a panel of overseers in your HMO who can say yea or nay to a proposal to bring in a specialist or have some advanced procedure , even if your doctor says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are involved in doing this , cost factors once more weigh heavily against the patient . ( See box , page 14 . ) <p> Walking in a Circle . Charges of care denial and inadequate treatment have prompted HMOs to back off from some restrictive procedures and also to put greater emphasis on monitoring for quality . This should be welcome news to patients , but in many cases seems quite belated and also open to other serious question . For instance , as noted by the Physician Payment Review Commission , one well-known rating system used by insurers to evaluate physicians " compares resource consumption by each practice with that of other doctors in the same specialty and the same region . " This rating service weighs " a broad array of utilization measures ( e.g. , number of laboratory tests and office visits and what they call long-range utilization ) , but not patient outcomes . " ( Italics added ) <p> Also , when methods are employed to monitor outcomes , the fallacy of the set-up remains apparent . The main financial incentives are geared to suppressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be accomplished . That is what " capitation , " withholds , bonuses , and review panels are all about  --  as one headline put it , to " Pay Doctors to Do Less . " Granted the best of motives and intentions , HMOs that say they are monitoring for quality are walking in a circle : Create massive financial incentives to get physicians to hold back care , then monitor them to make sure they do n't . <p> In arguing that they deliver quality care , HMO promoters cite opinion surveys of enrollees indicating that a large majority  --  80% and more are satisfied with what they get . The trouble with this standard is evident in the numbers already cited , showing that most people at most times and places are n't in need of expensive care , instead requiring medical outlays that do n't exceed a few hundred dollars a year . In a system providing routine services for next to nothing , it naturally follows that the vast majority of enrollees at any given . time will be happy with their " free " prescriptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the system is otherwise : How responsive is it when people are desperately ill and in need of some life-saving treatment ? <p> Just Helpless Bystanders . In this respect as in others , the medical model being evolved by HMOs closely resembles those in countries such as Canada and England . In the English system , as previously reported in CR , people are provided with fairly lavish routine benefits , which has made the National Health Service politically appealing . However , when elderly patients need some expensive treatment , such as kidney dialysis , they are quite commonly turned away . Since they are both old and seriously ill , as well as a small minority of the country , they do n't count for much in the political equation . Meanwhile , all the people who are getting " free " routine benefits , who make up the vast majority of the population , may be serenely happy with the system  --  until , of course , their time arrives for serious treatment . <p> As in the British set-up , the U.S. move to managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , medical treatment on the other . In most forms of insurance , as on our automobiles or homes , we buy protection against unexpected and potentially ruinous expenses , while paying our daily routine bills for gas and oil and home improvements out of pocket . In health insurance-plus-managed care , we are getting exactly the reverse : Coverage for routine expenses that could be met out ' of pocket by all except the poorest , but increasing exposure to the most serious threats to our survival . The motto of this system might well be : " We 're there until you need us . " <p> In terms of medical practice , we are also seeing a reversal of accepted values . In the traditional view , your doctor is supposed to be working for you , to do all he can for your health and well-being , and generally function as a patient advocate . Under managed care , this too is turned upside down ; the doctor is no longer working for you , but for the HMO or other payer , who tells him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , generally without your knowledge and all too possibly against your interest . Because you are n't paying , you are reduced to the role of helpless bystander , even though it 's your life that 's in the balance . The process becomes all the more lethal to patients because generally they have no idea of what is occurring and can take no measures of self-protection . <p> A final irony is that HMOs and managed care are being promoted by employers , insurers , and some Republicans in Congress as " market-based reform . " A " market , " however , is a system in which people pay for what they get , respond to prices , and make decisions for themselves , according to their preferences and options . Thanks to extensive government subsidy and intervention , and the resulting pattern of third-party payment , our health care system lacks all these features , and thus has small resemblance to a market . <p> In this third-party format , HMOs and managed care , and other forms of rationing , are doing in camouflaged form what government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controls and resource constraints , using physicians as care deniers to hold down costs . True market-based reform would go in the opposite direction  --  empowering , not HMOs , but patients . <p> For related CR articles see : " Pro-Consumer Health Reform in Action , " May 1995 ; " Making Money By Denying Health Care , " September 1994 ; " Why There is a Health Care Crisis , " June 1994 ; " New Plan Cuts Health Care Costs in Half , " October 1993 ; " How to Solve the Health Care Crisis , " March 1992 . <p> By M.
