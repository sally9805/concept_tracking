IN A 300-YEAR-OLD converted farmhouse in the hills of Tuscany , Charles a Handy sits in front of a PowerBook 540c trying to make the world a better place . He 's not a guru or a futurologist or an aging hippie with joss sticks . Charles Handy is a philosopher for the world of business and management . And like the best philosophers , he aims to describe the future to help us get ready before it grinds our dreams into pulp . The 62-year-old , Irish-born author 's reputation is rising fast among managers around the globe , from executives at PepsiCo to the bishop of Oxford . Their worries are your worries : that corporate downsizing is leaving workers and managers burned out and lacking in values , that successful companies must find better ways to reward employees in order to remain on top , and that the only constant in business life today is change . Says Handy : " My job is to be ten years ahead , which is why a lot of people tend to say I 'm stupid . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His prediction that by 2000 half the working population would be making a living outside traditional organizations seemed crazy in the early 1980s . Today more than 35% of Americans in the labor force either are unemployed or are temporary , part-time , or contractual workers . In Europe the figure is already close to 50% . Handy has provided some of the classic management ideas of the past decade , including the shamrock organization , the doughnut principle , and the portfolio career . The first gave companies a blueprint for identifying core activities and outsourcing everything else . The second helped managers and workers distinguish between the essential parts of a job or career  --  by somewhat strange logic identified as the hole in the doughnut  --  and the discretionary parts . The third encouraged workers not to think of their current jobs as a career but as just one part of a lifetime portfolio of wages , contract fees , charity work , and study . AUTHOR of a half-dozen respected texts on organizations , his bestseller , The Age of Unreason , forecast the collapse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attendant unfolding of the new service-based economy . These events , he wrote in the 1989 book , offer unparalleled opportunities for all of us . His second big seller , The Age of Paradox , published earlier this year , recognized the dark side of these developments , with companies ruthlessly pursuing efficiency at the expense of workers , the community , and maybe even their own futures . While Handy has not always been the first to make these points , his jargon-free observations usually pack more power because of their clarity and prescriptive nature . Listen to his admirers . John Jennings , vice chairman of Royal Dutch/Shell , calls him " a purveyor of insight , a man of supreme common sense . " Adds Max De Pree , chairman of Herman Miller : " He makes a direct connection to what we ought to be doing and the social context . " Says Kate Owen , head of organizational development at BP : " He anticipated almost all the challenges we have faced in recent years . " Charles Handy , for all that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundation and has no staff . His business partner is his wife , Elizabeth , on whom he shamelessly dotes . She alone is allowed to take his photograph ( as she did for this article ) . When he 's writing in Italy or in his cottage in Norfolk , England , his mail is opened by the maid who cleans his London flat . She forwards very little of it . Although he has three homes , all are modest in size and decorated unpretentiously with shelves of books and paintings mostly done by unrecognized young artists . The three-bedroom home in Tuscany is one of eight apartments fashioned from the old farmhouse , stables , and barn . Handy is currently head of the owners ' association and frets about the cost of sinking another well . At lunch , he happily serves guests a local wine for which he paid less than $1 a bottle . At dinner , he brings out the good stuff . He and his wife shop together , always lugging along the empty wine bottles for recycling . Their proudest possessions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a couple of new grandparents . When you meet him , you soon feel as if you 're talking to your favorite professor , or the first person t who believed you 'd make something of your life . Padding about his Tuscan home in old running shoes and a well-used British Airways first-class sleeper top , Handy is disarmingly frank about the responsibility and guilt he feels having been raised in " unearned privilege " as an Anglican vicar 's son in the Republic of Ireland , not to mention his education at boarding schools and ultra-elitist Oxford . After walking out on a promising career at Shell in his 30s and a tenured professorship at the London Business School in his 40s , Handy now spends nearly six months a year just thinking and writing . Although he can command top rates  --  as much as $15,000 to $35,000 an advisory session  --  he restricts his corporate work to just enough to cover the bills . Says he : " It would corrupt my role as a thinker to be a consultant . I would become sold on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disdain for consultants , you 're right . Handy does consult with about ten corporate clients a year , but he sets himself apart from his consulting brethren by insisting on rather unusual preconditions . First , the clients must agree to read his major books and papers . Then they must gather in his living room in suburban London to tell him all about their company . " I do n't prowl around companies like a consultant , " he says . " I want to see the organization through their eyes . " Handy calls on his classical education , using the Socratic method of questioning . " I remind them of the key facts : Organizations are slimmer , jobs are found more and more outside the company , careers are shorter , " he says . " Next I ask , " How are you finding it ? " I try to be a sounding board . " Rather than acting the part of a Tom Peters , say , or a Peter Senge , Handy compares himself to a good interior designer . Says he : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . He or she says : " Have you looked at this room as a pool of conviviality ? What would happen ? ' ' " By asking questions , Handy says , he opens the way for companies to solve their own problems . Finally , after the Socratic session at home , both Handys visit the client . Charles addresses a group of workers or a meeting . Elizabeth sometimes takes photographs . The sessions pay well enough to allow Handy to aid 15 or so nonprofit organizations and charities during the year either free or for very low fees . Jokes Elizabeth : " We take from the rich to cover our work with the poor and give ourselves enough to live on in the process . " HANDY DOES N'T OFFER a clip-out guide with five steps to managing the future or ten ways to restore morale among your burned-out staff . He has no workbook to order . Charles , as he likes to be called , would rather lob questions like hand grenades to shake up your thinking . He works hard creating management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines that he uses to show that companies will come to a natural end if they do n't re-create themselves during good times . But the sigmoid curve is just a starting point . And although his own shamrock and doughnut principles have become linked to downsizing and reengingeering , he 's come to despise those processes ( see box ) . Handy 's method may seem a rather unorganized way of managing for the future , but top executives from organizations as diverse as Guinness , Arthur Andersen , British Petroleum , the Save the Children Foundation , and various Silicon Valley startups regularly make the trip to the Handys ' London home . Says David Hatch , vice president of management development at Pepsi : " I do n't like cookbook approaches . That 's not the way the world is . Charles gives you models and language to create your own cookbook . " Adds Brian Baldock , vice chairman of Guinness : " People often bring in consultants because they are n't confident to change something themselves . A conversation with Charles gives you that confidence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles 's wife in the Handys ' elegantly understated 19th-century apartment in suburban southwest London . You soon stop noticing that the seat covers need replacing , and start listening . " What is happening now is equivalent to what happened when the printing press was invented in the 1400s , " he begins . " The authority of the church crumbled because we could all read the Bible in our own homes and make up our own minds about God . Priests were suddenly just people . " Television robs presidents of authority , he goes on , computers liberate people from corporate authority , and CD-ROMs will soon rob teachers of their power because students will have instant access to everything teachers know . Says he : " This will lead to a renaissance , which in one way is great , because so much creativity will bubble up . But it also heralds a very turbulent time . People are often frightened when there is no authority around . " To avoid the growing uneasiness inside and outside companies , Handy says , we must apply what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of the future that stands everything we think we know on its head . When we were all employed , he says , " we basically sold our time for money . So as long as we were doing what we wanted to do , the point of our lives was to get as much money for it as possible . Money was the measure of our success . " In that world , education was primarily for a fixed time , and then it ended . The government provided certain benefits . Upside-down thinking says that all these certainties will soon be dead . Governments are going broke and ca n't afford benefits . Education will have to become never-ending . Corporate taxes will go up if companies do n't recognize their role in training and education . Because they can take nothing for granted  --  including their jobs  --  workers will need to learn how to value time as well as money . If society is to absorb all this change without undue turmoil , nothing short of a revolution is needed in Western ways of capitalism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Consider Handy on the following : * On those being " reengineered " out of jobs : " Very soon , half the work force of the developed world will be " outside " the organization . The future prosperity of all of us will depend on their competencies and their education , yet no one seems to be noticing or caring . If workers do n't continually develop and update their skills , not only will they be of no use to the organization but , worse , they will be a growing burden to the rest of us . Few will bother to educate themselves if the government and corporations do n't do it . The result : Half of the population could be out of work . " * On those left with jobs in corporations : " Jobs are now created by those who do them , not by bosses . In the age of intellectual capital , we need to rethink the constitution of our corporations to give a proper voice to those who really own that capital  --  the core workers . We should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which recognizes the rights and obligations of all the parties involved , but particularly the members of the company . " * On the rights of shareholders in the age of intellectual capital : " When the assets of an enterprise are primarily its people , it is time to rethink what it means to say that those who finance the enterprise can in any sensible way " own " those assets . " Shareholders , he says , are bleeding companies . Capital investment lags behind dividend and profit growth . Argues Handy : " The property concept of a company is out of date . " One suggestion : two classes of shares , perhaps , in which core employees and those running the business own " A " shares that have a equal voting weight to " B " shares , which would be sold to investors through financial markets . * On pursuing growth in the age of intellectual capital : " Unreconstructed capitalism has its dangers . We are going down a dead-end II road if we think that economic growth is the only thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead to economies of " useless things " instead of cultivation . Unless we find more growth in cultivation , we risk destroying the world for our children . " * SOUNDS LIKE New Age Karl Marx ? Travel up to the top floor of Shell Centre on the south bank of the Thames in London . In his sumptuous , black-paneled office , John Jennings , vice chairman of $95-billion-a  --  year Royal Dutch/Shell , says that while he does n't buy all of Handy 's ideas , many of them are currently being mulled at Shell . For example , Shell is deeply concerned with how to motivate its core workers while giving adequate skills and incentives to workers who may well face a downsizing exercise in the years ahead . Says Ernest Mourik Broekman , head of human resources : " The uniform manager population , those with the same career pattern , is slowly fading away . We 're looking at ways to recognize people in a core career group and people who might not have a core career at Shell . The latter group would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain , they could go back to it . " One possibility , he adds , would be to increase up-front compensation for noncore managers and decrease pension benefits . Jennings rejects Handy 's ideas about sharing corporate ownership with key workers , but he does agree that growth may not always be good : " In the Cold War , we thought nuclear arms could lead to the destruction of mankind . In the unfettered mercantilism that has followed the end of the Cold War , we are finding that it could lead to the destruction of the earth 's ecosystem . I think Handy is right , but how do we better define progress if not through conventional measures of growth ? " A realist , Jennings admits : " My board would think I 'm crazy if I brought this up . " Instead , he discusses these and other Handy ideas with his corporate planners and the heads of Shell 's operating units . Arthur Andersen , the $6-billion-a-year accounting firm based in Chicago , finds Handy 's ideas equally provocative . Dick Measelle , worldwide managing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give them security in an insecure world . " People are assets , not expenses , " he says . " We have been an up-or-out organization , and that 's getting expensive . " As Andersen is the kind of company that handles other companies ' outsourcing , it 's in the rare position of wanting almost all its employees to remain at the core , and maybe even stay with the company . So Andersen is working on new ways to boost an employee 's sense of belonging . Says Measelle : " We 're looking for a method to make employees who have five or six years of service into members . " Though not a partnership , it could include some official recognition and profit sharing . Measelle sees it as less of a legal promotion , as becoming a partner would be , and " more of a spiritual bond . " Using Handy 's sigmoid-curve analogy , the company is re-creating itself in order to keep its core people glued to their seats . Its three new business curves , according to Measelle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making the company " the best place in the world to work , " and targeting the Asia/Pacific , particularly China , for mega-development . HANDY 'S WRITINGS do n't just affect companies ; they often hit individuals in a powerful way , like the advice of a trusted friend or relative . For Charles himself , it was Elizabeth who pushed him to leave Shell and then the London Business School , despite the sacrifice in salary and security both times . In turn , Charles has given similar help to others . Sir Christopher Hogg , for example , chose to leave his job as both chairman and CEO of Courtaulds , the huge British chemical company , in 1991 at age 55 , even though he was widely admired for his skill in the post . He was troubled by the pressures of combining the roles of CEO and chairman . So he gave up the CEO post while continuing as chairman . He also held on to his job as chairman of Reuters , the news agency , continued as a trustee of the Ford Foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of England and SmithKline Beecham . Says Sir Christopher : " It took some courage to make the leap . I get my kicks running things hands-on . But my plural life makes me more reflective . I see a wide variety of business activity , and I think that helps me to do things better . " While he applauds the efforts of Shell ; Andersen , and Sir Christopher , Handy himself shies away from giving out case studies or examples . Says he : " I could point to Microsoft as the example of a company built entirely on intellectual property , but I would n't want to assume they 've got it right . " Instead , he moves the conversation along to his current thinking about the Third Age , a notion he borrowed from the French , Le Troisieme Age , originally meaning retirement . " A third of the population is over 55  --  soon it will be half , " he says . " Retirement should be banned  --  the word should be banned . We , as a society , ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Britain , for example , by 2030 , you 'll receive a pension worth 8% of your last wage . In Italy it 's currently 40% . " He predicts that companies will eliminate corporate pension plans within the next decade . Universal personal plans will replace them . Handy says that in the name of efficiency , " companies are reneging on their responsibility to pay workers a decent wage for their lifetime career . " As a result , those companies have a responsibility to ensure that workers have skills that can help them find work after they leave the company . " If they do n't do it , " he adds , " there will be big pain ahead in the form of heavy taxes levied on companies by governments . And that will limit corporate efficiency . " In Baglan Bay , New South Wales , BP Chemicals has just completed its first two-day course to bring that point home to employees . The course will eventually be offered at BP Chemicals units across Europe . Says Kate Owen , at BP : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gone are the days when a line manager would sift through a list of courses . Instead , we are moving toward providing development which is designed for individuals , to enhance their skills and personal portfolio . " IF WORKERS like these are " reengineered , " they can approach the Third Age with more optimism . Says Handy : " People must stop thinking about retirement or taking a package at 55 as the beginning of leisure , but start thinking about two decades of another kind of work . It 's a third of your adult life . Developing this part of it could be the salvation of society . " Handy 's advice to aging baby-boomers : " Look for customers , not bosses . " Specifically , he says , education is a prime job opportunity for the young oldster . Says he : " In ten years , more education will take place outside of schools and universities than inside . " He points to a variety of opportunities , from the increasing need for coaching and training inside companies to the creation of CD-ROMs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also be the consumer group to track for the future . " They 'll be the main consumers and the bulk of the voters , " he says . " They 'll spend more on information , food , wine , books , CD-ROMs . They 'll want smaller , quieter cars that pollute less . They 'll care more about the environment , noise , beauty , learning , and less about consuming . " Another Handy view of the future is based on federalism , a theory of management he borrowed from political theory . Federalist organizations , he says , get their energy from their satellite businesses , with the center serving only as a low-profile " force of influence . " In the age of bottom-up decision-making and empowerment , the old-fashioned notions of corporate control and contracts of employment are now meaningless . Says he : " Organizations today have to be based on trust . How many people can you know well enough to trust ? Probably 50 people at most . So , increasingly , organizations will be made up of groups of 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The consequences , he says , will be the increasing disappearance of the middle ranks of managers and the increased importance of team members . PepsiCo 's Hatch says his is a federalist company . " All our divisions are very autonomous , " he says . " But the notion of federalism gives us a language and a framework to help us interact as we get bigger and bigger . We do n't want to become the Postal Service . " This kind of team play is great for the individual , says Handy , but tough on the spirit of the corporation and society . Says he : " As people become their own agents , the corporate community breaks down . We get a lot of projects , but no sense of something bigger . " In today 's world , he stresses , " workers know that loyalty has to go first to your team or project , second to your profession , and only third to the place where you work . " This creates one of Handy 's most potent paradoxes : Companies ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of themselves first ; yet companies ' most valuable assets are their people . This notion brings him full circle to his primary concern today . He predicts : " The power of capitalism will undoubtedly diminish unless we give more power to the real assets : people . If you want a model for the new sort of capitalism , you are more likely to find it in the family business networks of Italy or South China than in America or Germany . " South China ? Says he : " Like all extended families , these businesses are based on informal ties of mutual obligation . They move fast , and they are prepared to sacrifice short-term profits for long-term benefits , and they know that they are bonded to a common future . This gives them a great advantage over the more unwieldy corporate giants of the West or even Japan . " While family-style capitalism is not likely to arrive in the West anytime soon , he says that unions might provide the community that the growing band of independent workers lack . As Handy works hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife spends more and more of her time turning away requests for his time . Why not hire an assistant or two to help with research , or a secretary to handle the correspondence ? Says a sheepish Handy : " It 's desperately important for people to know their own skills . I found out at about age 50 that I 'm a good thinker but a terrible manager . Therefore , I should stick to thinking . " HANDY TIPS FROM CHARLES * Look for customers , not bosses . * Europe will be united within ten years . * Expect to work intensively for 25 years , not 45 years . Plan for you less-intensive life now . * Corporate pension plans will be dead within the next decade . * Study not-for-profit organizations if you want to learn about motivating your employees . * Loyalty has to go first to your team or project , second to your profession or discipline , and only third to the place where you work . * Consultants ? Stay clear . No one is better qualified to solve your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education will occur outside schools . <p>
