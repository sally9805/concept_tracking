<p> Jack Valenti , 69 , is president and CEO of the Motion Picture Association of America , positions he has held since 1966 . Valenti , who served as assistant to President Johnson , also is an author and is founder of the movie ratings system . He was interviewed by members of USA TODAY 's editorial board and Life section . Q : Will the new NC-17 movie rating that replaced X give a marketing advantage to soft-core and hard-core films by allowing them to advertise ? <p> A : I think the hard-core people are n't going to try . But I think movies like Henry and June will be able to advertise . Most of the major newspapers are going to take it on a case-by-case basis . Hard-core porn will never be advertised because a newspaper has a perfect right to refuse it . Q : Why did you change the rating ? <p> A : Many in the film industry felt that the X rating had become soiled because of the kind of pictures that inhabited that category . When we first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ X rating to be adults only . But over the years , a lot of pictures that went , as the British would say , " beyond the pale , " began to populate that category . Q : Could n't the same thing happen with NC-17 ? <p> A : When I designed the system , I did n't trademark the X rating because I thought that it ought to be available to everybody . But we trademarked NC-17 . Which means that if you do n't submit a film , you can put on it X , triple X , E. Pluribus Unum , anything you want , but you ca n't put on it NC-17 . Q : How many movies have been rated NC-17 so far ? <p> A : We 've had 19 pictures rated NC-17 . Nine of them are pictures that go into hotels . The other 10 are pictures that were unrated before . We have canvassed about 50 major cities and were able to determine only one NC-17 picture is playing in theaters today , Henry and June . Q : You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite a change from what you were saying earlier about changing the system . <p> A : I determined last March that I was going to do something about this rating system . My public face was , " It 's working fine . What do we need to change for ? " If I had said , " Yes , we need to make some changes , " I would have been run down in an avalanche . Q : Why have n't you modified the ratings to add a V for violence , S for sex , and so forth ? <p> A : I think that betrays the truth . If we took most of the pictures today that get PGs and PG-13s , they would have the same letters on them that an X or an NC-17 would have . I do n't believe saying " violence " or " nudity " or " sensuality " or " language " is telling anybody anything . Q : Why not ? <p> A : What you ca n't get in the letters is degree and intensity . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of violence , a woman getting out of a bathtub showing a half-bared breast , in order to be accurate , you 'd have to say , " Language , nudity and violence . " Q : Does the movie industry follow the public mood ? <p> A : People in Hollywood who make films and invest their money are very sensitive to the public mood . Die Hard and some of the other $ 50 million action pictures did n't do that well . I have n't seen Kindergarten Cop , but Arnold Schwarzenegger - and I 've talked to him about this - while he 's very big around the world on action pictures , he realizes that the mood is changing . Times change . And the society has changed . What we try to do in the rating system is to move with these clouded winds that blow . Q : Let 's shift gears somewhat . The movie industry is battling the TV networks over syndication rules that have been in place two decades . The marketplace has changed since then . Why ca n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A : What has n't changed follows : One , if you want to get on prime time television today as you did in 1970 , you have to go through three gateways and only three . Only the three networks reach 98% of all American television homes . If you want to get on television , one of those networks has got to approve you . And as a condition for going on , they can extort from you - and I use that word deliberately - rights that you do n't want to give away . That is a steady , remorseless fact of life . Q : But the networks have said they would be willing to finance independent producers , have n't they ? <p> A : I ask you to ponder carefully the following question : Why is it , if the networks have this beneficent attitude , that not one single independent producer in the entire United States wants any part of this network fiscal kiss ? Because they know the network lips are dipped in anti-competitive curare . Q : Are the networks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losses , network audience share is slipping - <p> A : You know why CBS is going to report a loss ? They made a calamitous business decision . The other two networks thought they were mad . They paid a billion and a half dollars for baseball rights . Dumb ! Now , I 've got news for you : No rule is going to save them from a bad business decision . But I do n't want a bad business decision to taint or shrink what I think is one of the great all-time competitive rules . It is one of the few government regulations that actually has achieved its objective , which is to set a fragile competitive balance in a marketplace that before the rule was barren of competition . Q : It is a fact that networks are losing audiences . <p> A : Let me give you the numbers ; they come from Nielsen , not from me . On any given moment in prime time , of all the people watching television , the networks have 60% to 65% of the audience . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie attendance used to be 84 million a week . Now , it 's 24 million a week . So you 'd have to say the movie business is on its last legs ? Not at all . We 're doing just fine . So are the networks . Q : Do you think the Federal Communications Commission will reverse the syndication rules ? <p> A : I think there 's going to be a compromise . Q : Why are n't there more blacks and other minorities in the movies and making movies when they contribute so much at the box office ? <p> A : You 've got to have the scripts to begin with . There are probably 700 to 800 producers out there . They 're black , they 're white , they 're Hispanic , they 're men , they 're women , they come from all walks of life . They 're liberal , they 're conservative . If a script came out on Martin Luther King Jr . that had great dramatic narrative , it would be made . All you 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's going to have people come into a theater like The Color Purple did . CUTLINE : Jack Valenti
