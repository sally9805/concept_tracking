<p> When writer Douglas Preston began researching the world described in the " Dine Bahane , " the Navajo creation story , he was surprised to learn that it is not mythical , but so real and rock-solid that it literally can be mapped . <p> The land described in the " Dine Bahane " sits smack in the middle of the Four Corners area . In Colorado , Hesperus Peak and Mount Blanca define two of its perimeters ; the others are Mount Taylor in New Mexico and the San Francisco Peaks in Arizona . Mon- ster Slayer , a Navajo god , traveled among those places . His path crossed Jornada del Muerto , the Southwest 's most merciless desert ( its name means " Journey of Death " ) and ancient Chaco Canyon . <p> That the creation legends were set in such solid , familiar ground is something that still astonishes Preston . <p> " The Navajo say ' The land is our Bible , and all the stories we have are in the land , ' and when you look at that land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " just as when we open the Bible , we read our stories . <p> " When the Navajos talk about the land as our relative , you might think , ' That 's an interesting metaphor . ' But out there , it 's not a metaphor . It 's literal . When you know the stories , you feel this kinship with the land that you would n't have felt otherwise . " <p> Something moved Preston to sit down and begin to map out the paths of Monster Slayer and the other Navajo gods on topographic maps . He consulted land claims documents , read monographs , Navajo-language dictionaries , anthropological texts , ethnographies , letters and journals , going back and forth from his resources to his topo maps . <p> Soon , his maps were covered with lines describing the gods ' journeys , their epic battles and the places where the legendary First People had lived and walked . He went out on some journeys along the paths he 'd marked on those maps . Eventually , his fiancee , Christine , who 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land described in the " Dine Bahane . " <p> " It will be our honeymoon , " Christine said . " With Selene . " <p> Too dangerous , Preston protested , thinking of crossing the Jornada del Muerto . Selene , a 9-year-old city kid , was appalled at the idea of riding 400 miles through the desert on a dirty old horse , eating beans , sleeping in a tent and <p> " Where am I supposed to go to the bathroom ? " Selene demanded . She was outraged when she heard the answer to that . <p> Christine persuaded them both to make the trip . It was easier to convince Preston than Selene . <p> Unmoved by the promise of seeing legendary Indian lands - this was several years before " Pocahontas " made her movie debut - and suspicious of what her mother described as " the adventure of a lifetime , " Selene resigned herself to the trip after Preston bribed her with a Nintendo Gameboy . <p> She took the Gameboy , along with a saddlebag full of candy , on what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the end of the trip , Selene asked Preston to recount Monster Slayer stories , though she still missed indoor plumbing . <p> Selene 's reluctant participation , Monster Slayer 's tale and other Navajo lore are woven together in Preston 's description of his family 's ride through Navajo creation lands . " Talking to the Ground " ( Simon &; Schuster , $ 24 ) is his account of their horseback trek as they retraced Monster Slayer 's path in what was , as he 'd anticipated , a risky journey . He did n't realize exactly how dangerous it was , though , until it was over . <p> " I have two feelings about the trip , " says Preston , who lives in Santa Fe with his family : Christine , Selene and Aletheia , 16 months , and Isaac , 1 month . <p> " One is that it was the most extraordinary landscape that I 'd ever seen in my whole life . I 'll never see land that beautiful again . Not to denigrate my book , but there 's no way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those landscapes . <p> " And on the other hand , I 'm amazed and aghast at myself for taking Christine and Selene on such a dangerous journey . Anytime you 're on horses , you can suffer serious injury , and when you 're 50 miles from the nearest road , and God knows how many more miles to the nearest telephone , and how many more to the nearest hospital - then you realize that the smallest accident could become life-threatening . " <p> Fortunately for Preston , Christine and Selene , there were no accidents . There was hardship - riding through dust devils , thunderstorms and sand storms , and at a bone-dry campsite hours from the nearest water source , Preston and Christine drank the canteen water they 'd used to wash dishes . ( Selene , repulsed , refused to drink it . ) <p> There were tensions and fights provoked by thirst , weariness and monotony . There was a strange , dark night when witches and skinwalkers ( evil spirits ) seemed as real as the dogs howling outside the hogan where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some Navajos who looked askance at this trio of Anglos - especially when Preston , Christine and Selene visited Monument Valley , where Indians rent their most placid ponies to Anglo tourists who rarely know how to sit in the saddle . In Monument , a Navajo named Lewis Atcitty eyed Preston , and Preston 's belt buckle . <p> " Nice Navajo belt buckle you got on , " Atcitty said , sarcastically . " And I bet you got no idea what it means . " He was right . <p> " He figured me out in five minutes , and challenged me right where he knew I was the most vulnerable , and really knocked me aback , " Preston said . <p> " At the time , I knew nothing about it , about how much the Navajo think , in everything they do , in traditional Navajo actions , about the number four . My Navajo belt buckle - all Navajo belt buckles - had four points . The number 4 has deep , deep , sacred significance among the Navajo . Their entire world is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In stories , things happen four times . In ceremonies , the number plays a major , major role . Everything happens in counts of four . It mirrors the dynamic pulse of the day-night cycle - dawn , day , twilight and night , the four sacred phenomena . " <p> Before the end of their conversation , Atcitty became friendly . He and another Navajo , Ed Black , recounted the story of how Monster Slayer and his family descended from First Man and First Woman . In their words , the myth is lively and alive , like gossip about a Saturday-night brawl . Here 's Atcitty describing the Navajos ' take on the Sun god : <p> " The Sun was a powerful guy . You do n't mess with him . Our gods are n't like the Christian god . The Sun , see , he 's not so nice , he does n't really give a s  --  about us . " <p> That 's one example , and there are many others in Preston 's elegant book , about how " Dine Bahane " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hundreds of years ago . For the Navajo , legends are n't dusty and distant , but as real and solid as Shiprock , or the four sacred peaks defining Navajoland . <p> " I really wanted to communicate in my book some of the complexity and rigor in Navajo religious philosophy , but I actually only scratched the surface , " Preston says . <p> " Any Navajo looking at my book would say , ' This is OK , as far as it goes , but it does n't touch 1 percent of Navajo religion . ' I had Navajos tell me , ' Look , you ca n't put this stuff in a book . ' Being a white person , I said , ' Sure I can . ' But at the end , I realized they were right . There 's no way you can put that in a book , any more than you can put the most sacred tenets of Zen Buddhism in a book . It has to be experienced over years and years of effort . " <p> As for Selene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding of the Navajo way of life - " what a reservation is really like , " says Preston , " not the PC , romanticized version . " Selene , now almost 13 , agrees . <p> " When people go to Monument Valley and tell me they 've seen it , " she says , " I 'm kind of a snob about it - I say , ' No , you have n't . ' I 've seen it in a way not many white people have seen it - the spiritual and historical side . I 've seen it from the back side . Most people have no ideas about the names of all the formations , the history behind them , the symbolism of everything . They just think it 's a pretty place . It is the most beautiful landscape I 've ever seen , but it 's more than that . " <p> One thing has n't changed : Selene still hates camping . The four-week trip left her prejudiced against the primitive pleasures of sleeping on the ground , drinking stale water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I probably would not go on that trip again , " she says . " I suppose it 'll be one of these things I 'll look back on and be glad I 've done . "
