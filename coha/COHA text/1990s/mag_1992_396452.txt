My mouth went dry as I waited for the three toms to move into range . But what I had n't noticed was the small , dirt hillock between me and the birds . As they moved behind it , all I could see were three bright-red heads , bobbing one after another like ducks in a shooting gallery . I lined up my best shot on what I thought was the largest bird , and bang ! The woods erupted as turkeys seemed to take off in every direction . My heart sank . With only the bird 's head to shoot at , I thought I might have missed . But when I looked over the mound , my first gobbler lay sprawled on the other side . At that moment I was the happiest hunter alive . And to this day , that first bird had the longest beard of any gobbler I 've ever taken  --  12-1/2 inches long . It took four long seasons for one important fact to finally sink in : Scouting makes you a better turkey hunter . Choosing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consistently successful turkey hunting . And although turkeys do n't leave the same kinds of semi-permanent sign that whitetail deer do  --  sign that can last until the next season  --  they do leave clues you can use to your advantage . Knowing how to interpret these clues and how to work the landscape could put you on the fast track to spring gobbler success . If I had really examined my area before killing that first gobbler I might have succeeded much sooner . Instead , I relied on calling and patience and expected the birds to cooperate . But turkey hunting rarely goes according to plan  --  unless that plan includes scouting . I did n't really call that first bird to me . I made it easy for him to come my way by guessing which route he would take . Often , that 's all you need . Your first step in scouting is deciding where to hunt . If you 're just starting out , look at your state 's harvest statistics for the previous spring and fall . They should tell you where most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high population of birds , a high number of hunters or a combination of the two . Counties with the most public land will usually have the highest harvest but will also have the most hunters . Look for places where access to public land is limited or difficult to travel to . Walk-in areas , where no vehicles are allowed , can also be prime targets . If you narrow your choices down early enough  --  say , by January , February or early March  --  you can use your vehicle to pre-scout from the road . This is especially effective in agricultural areas . Often , large flocks of turkeys will feed on waste grains on cold , sunny days . This can give you an idea of how many turkeys an area holds . Flocks break up for the mating season at various times , again depending on latitude . It may be as soon as early February in the South , and as much as six to eight weeks later in Northern states . Once flock breakup takes place , head into the woods early in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will peak at various times depending on latitude and the weather . At this time toms are battling for territories and dominance  --  the right to breed freely with no interference . The birds will be vocal , and this is when you 'll be able to get the best idea of how many gobblers are actually using an area . Later , gobbling activity seems to diminish . The dominant tom will still sound off , but birds he 's vanquished wo n't gobble much at all . Still , just before the season opens is an ideal time to make one or two additional scouting trips . And if you did n't walk before , be prepared to walk now . Get out early , well before light , and be at the spot where you plan to start hunting on opening morning . The first gobbles you hear will come from birds on the roost . Make a mental note of their general location . If you can get a good topographical map of the area , do so . On it , mark the places where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urge to call . A gobbler tricked once is a gobbler that 's harder to call later . Turkeys will usually fly down from their roost just after first light . You might hear their wings flapping or perhaps just notice that the gobbles sound different . Note on a map , if possible , where they fly down and try to determine where they go once they 're on the ground . Sometimes a gobbler will get together with hens right off the roost . Other times , a gobbler may go to a favorite area , or strutting ground , where he can see and be seen , a place where the hens know they can find him . Often , he may service hens after he flies down , then head for a strutting area later . By carefully listening for several mornings you might be able to foil his game plan with one of your own . Getting between the gobbler and where he wants to go  --  to the hens  --  is always an effective strategy . Heading him off at the strutting area will work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier said than done . Gobbling may stop completely around 9 or 10 a.m. and may resume later when the tom has worked his way through all of the willing hens . This is a good time to get acquainted with the area 's terrain . Take your map with you . Head for areas where you think gobblers were roosting . An undisturbed bird often roosts in the same general area year-round . Finding wing feathers scattered about or droppings under trees are both good clues . According to Larry Vangilder , turkey biologist for the Missouri Department of Conservation , a gobbler 's primary wing feathers measure from 18-3/4 to 21-1/2 inches in length , and a hen 's vary from 15 to 17-1/4 inches . Like anything else in nature , however , there will be some overlap . But if you find several fresh wing feathers in an area  --  long wing feathers  --  you can bet gobblers have roosted there . In the spring , you can also identify a gobbler 's wing feathers because they 're squared off at the tips . As for roosts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In an area with many small trees , turkeys may choose the tallest , sturdiest trees they can find . In many parts of the country , turkeys seem to prefer pines and oaks , especially those with at least one stout branch growing parallel to the ground and with plenty of headroom above . Unfortunately , in some places that covers most of the trees in the woods . In hilly terrain , turkeys often prefer to roost in trees growing about halfway to two-thirds up a ridgeline . Droppings remain one of the best clues to a turkey 's presence and sexual identity . Those that form a " J " almost always belong to a gobbler ; those that form a squiggle belong to a hen . You 'll find droppings at roost areas . However , during all of the years I 've hunted turkeys , I 've only found one tree with a tremendous pile of droppings at its base . More often than not , turkeys choose roost areas rather than a specific tree , and droppings will be scattered . You may also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pathways , look for strutting grounds . In my experience , turkeys seem to like strutting on a hard surface , one that 's fairly free of tangled undergrowth . While you 're scouting your area , keep your eyes on the ground . You 're not only looking for droppings and wing feathers , you 're looking for tracks and breast feathers , two other important signs of gobbler activity . Also look for tracks in mud or dust . According to Vangilder , any Eastern-strain-turkey track that measures 4-1/2 inches or more from the front of the toe to the back of the heel belongs to a mature gobbler . Parallel drag marks in the dust or mud are a dead giveaway to a gobbler 's strutting ground . These marks indicate where the gobbler 's wing tips scraped the ground while he was displaying . Drag marks are difficult to spot . They look like someone took a stick and pulled it through the dirt . Also look for luminous feathers in striking shades of bronze , copper , green , pink and purple tipped with black . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're another tip-off to a favored strutting zone . A hen 's breast feathers are tipped with brown . Scratchings , small patches of exposed ground where turkeys kicked away leaves or other debris while feeding , are another tip-off . Old scratchings will have litter in their centers , and their edges will be flat . Newer ones will have clean centers with leaves or other debris piled up at the rear edge . Scratchings show you where turkeys have been feeding , and an area with lots of fresh ones is a good place to set up and call . You can even track turkeys using their scratchings . The turkeys kick the leaves behind them , so the side of a scratching with no debris is the direction in which a turkey is headed . Make your area 's terrain work for you , too . Try to figure out the easiest ways for a gobbler to get from one spot to another . In an area of steep hills and narrow valleys , something as insignificant as a slight saddle on a ridgetop might make a gobbler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be a depression in a field or a dip where he 'll be out of sight . Turkeys use fencerows , and birds often travel along field edges . If you spot turkeys in any of these places more than a few times , it 's a good bet you 've stumbled across one of their regular routes . A spot like this makes a terrific ambush location in the late morning after gobbling dies down . Scouting for turkeys can work no matter where you hunt these wary birds . It 's a simple matter of knowing what you 're looking for and then putting it all together . And if you do your job correctly , you wo n't have to wait four long years to bag your first gobbler . Waiting is the hardest part . <p>
