Section : The Nature of Learning <p> I was never any good at math . My poor father , a physicist , used to sit with me after school and attempt to explain why it would cost Johnny $1.90 to buy four apples at a quarter each , plus six oranges at fifteen cents each . I was thinking about tennis matches and my friends , not about Johnny and his shopping adventures . ( I am pleased to say , however , that like most people , I am no longer paralyzed by such simple problems and have no trouble purchasing my own fruit and obtaining the correct change . ) <p> How do numerical abilities develop in the4human child ? Are number words  --  like " one , " " forty-four , " or a " million "  --  necessary before a child understands how to count or add ? Or is language more like a luxury feature on a car  --  something that zips it up and makes it run better ? <p> In most human cultures , children begin spontaneously enumerating objects in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquiring number words and fully understanding their significance is a gradual one . Presented with a plate of four cookies and asked , " How many ? " , a two-year-old girl responds , " One , two , three , four . Four . " Asked the same question about the same cookies a few seconds later , she repeats , " One , two , three , four . Four . " <p> In contrast , older children will count the cookies on the first go but answer " four " right away when asked a second time . Unlike two-year-olds , they understand that the last number in the string represents the total number of objects counted . <p> Understanding the sequential properties of counting does n't appear to develop until a child can count beyond three . But what about infants , who have not begun to talk yet ? Do they have any numerical abilities ? If so , what is going on in their minds during computation ? And since we ca n't ask them directly , how do we find out ? It turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least  --  involves a little magic . <p> When a magician causes a human body to levitate , we keep our eyes glued to the stage . We know that human bodies are incapable of floating and so are fascinated by a trick that appears to defy the laws of nature . Psychologists know that infants , too , look longer at events that violate their expectations about the world and so they often design experiments that use the element of surprise to gain insight into the preverbal mind . Those in the business of surprising infants call this technique the expectancy violation , or looking-time , procedure . <p> A few years ago , developmental psychologist Karen Wynn , of the University of Arizona , conducted a series of looking-time experiments with five-month-old infants to determine whether they could do simple arithmetic . Here is what the babies saw in a 1 + 1 = 2 test . One Mickey Mouse doll was placed on an empty stage . A screen was then raised , hiding Mickey . Next , a hand holding a second Mickey emerged from a hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second doll , too , behind the screen . After a few seconds , the screen was removed , revealing the two Mickeys . <p> Sometimes , however , researchers working behind the raised screen secretly took away one of the two dolls or added a third . Wynn found that when the screen was removed , infants looked a few crucial seconds longer when there was one or three Mickeys than when there were two . This suggests that the children 's observations had led them to form an image of two Mickeys behind the screen and to expect to see two when the screen was gone . A 2 - 1 = 1 test produced comparable results . Based on these findings , Wynn argued that human infants enter the world capable of doing simple mathematical operations . <p> How do the apparent mathematical abilities of these infants compare with those of nonhuman animals ? An African gray parrot and several chimpanzees , for example , have learned the association between abstract symbols and their numerical equivalents . When shown a mixed set of objects on a tray , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us ( in English ) that there are six green triangles but only three red blocks . And Sally Boysen 's chimpanzee Sheba can point correctly to the Arabic numeral 6 after first finding a pile of two and then a pile of four oranges . <p> These studies indicate that nonhuman animals can discriminate among sets of objects based on the number of items in each set . Like some studies of human infants , however , the animal work fails to elucidate the precise structure and content of the numerical representation involved . We do n't know , for example , whether the animals or the infants are manipulating nonlinguistic symbols in their minds that stand for the number of objects that they perceive or whether they are simply perceiving a difference in the visual scene that corresponds to something like " the amount of stuff " present . Perhaps , instead of six individual oranges , Sheba sees a patch of orange bigger than the patch associated with , say , four oranges . To disentangle these possibilities , we need additional experiments as well as different methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I began to apply the magic of the looking-time procedure to the study of nonhuman minds , in particular the minds of free-ranging rhesus monkeys on Cayo Santiago , an island off the coast of Puerto Rico , and of cotton-top tamarins living at Harvard University . We started our investigations by replicating Wynn 's original 1 + 1 = 2 and 2 - 1 = 1 studies , with a few minor changes . For example , instead of seeing Mickey on stage , the rhesus monkeys watched brightly colored eggplants ; the tamarins , colorful pieces of Froot Loops cereal . And while the tamarins were tested under controlled conditions at Harvard , we worked with the rhesus monkeys on sandy beaches and in mangrove swamps , where we were sometimes joined by several of their companions , grooming , eating , drinking , or mating . The results ? The adult rhesus and tamarins handily passed their first math tests , as well as more difficult ones that human infants pass only at the age of ten months . So far , then , the numerical abilities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be tied . <p> Recently , developmental psychologists Fei Xu and Susan Carey , of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , came up with a clever way to explore other aspects of the mathematical abilities of very young children and , perhaps , to break the tie . Here 's the intuition behind their experiment . If you pass by a window ledge with an apple pie on it and then , minutes later , walk by again and discover a strawberry pie there instead , you are likely to assume that this is a second pie , not that the apple pie was magically transformed into a strawberry pie . In their experiment , Xu and Carey used objects of perhaps more interest to babies than pies : a toy truck and a toy duck . They put babies  --  some ten and some twelve months old  --  in front of a screen set on top of a table and manipulated the toys from behind it . First , they moved the truck so that the babies saw it emerge from the left side of the screen ; then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only appeared to do so ) . Next , they brought the duck out from the right side of the screen and allowed the babies to watch before replacing it , too , behind the screen ( or , again , seeming to do so ) . Finally , they removed the screen , revealing either both the truck and the duck or only one of the toys , depending on the particular test . <p> There were striking differences in the responses of the two age groups . Twelve-month-olds looked longer when only one toy was left , suggesting that they correctly understood the truck and duck to be separate objects and that they expected both of them to be there . Ten-month-olds , in contrast , seemed unfazed regardless of the outcome , looking for the same amount of time at a truck and duck together as at either one alone . At this age , infants apparently assume that a duck can be transformed into a truck , or vice versa . <p> Intriguingly , as Xu and Carey learned from parents , infants who passed the test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " duck , " while those who failed the test did not . The researchers argued that word comprehension is therefore necessary for this particular test of mental competence . And if this is the case , then  --  deductive drum roll  --  we can hypothesize that nonhuman animals , lacking language , should fail . <p> The problem is , they do n't . I teamed up with Xu , Carey , and Claudia Uller ( then a Ph.D . candidate at MIT ) to replicate the experiment with adult rhesus monkeys . Instead of trucks and ducks , however , we used a carrot and a squash . What we found was that unlike the preverbal children , the monkeys passed with flying colors . <p> Up to now , then , we have found no hard evidence to support the idea that language must come before the ability to perform simple math . But , as we all know , at some point in their development , children leave monkeys in their dust . Rhesus monkeys and tamarins may be able to do simple sums , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank tellers . Our goal now is to pinpoint at what age young children begin to succeed at math tests that nonhuman primates fail , and what new learning mechanisms or conceptual developments enable them to do so . I suspect the crucial skills will involve the mastery of symbols , although not necessarily language per se . Whatever gets children started down the road to solving differential equations and balancing a checkbook , it is a road no monkey is likely to travel . Sweet Sums <p> When it comes to chocolate , chimpanzees know what counts . In a series of experiments , Duane Rumbaugh , of Georgia State University , and co-workers allowed chimps to pick between two trays of chocolates . Each tray had two wells that held the candies , and the number of chocolates in each well varied from zero to five . In 90 percent of trials , the chimps summed the wells and picked the tray that held the greater number of chocolates . No word on whether they preferred bittersweet or milk .  --  Annette Heist <p> <p> ILLUSTRATIONS <p> By Marc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
