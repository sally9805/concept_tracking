FOR JUST A WHILE , THE SIGNS WERE HOPEFUL . THE parties in Waco 's six-week standoff seemed to look beyond , toward the multiboard legal chess match bound to follow a peaceful resolution . The Texas Rangers , for instance , were reportedly miffed that fbi negotiators had unintentionally caused the Branch Davidians to sanitize possible court evidence  --  scrubbing away blood , sweeping up spent cartridges and reducing automatic guns back to semiautomatics . The FBI denied the report . The Davidians , too , employed a kind of spin control that implied something will remain intact to spin . David Koresh 's attorneys talked about contesting some government assertions  --  in court  --  and described in detail a surrender scheduled after the group 's Passover . Koresh also deputized two New York City lawyers to handle his book , television and movie rights , hardly the act of a man contemplating martyrdom . <P> &; Alas , matters degenerated . First , the Davidians distanced themselves from the Passover pledge . Then a cult member tried to climb out a compound window after dark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upbraided Koresh over it , he cursed them . As if to symbolize the new low in communications , they hung up on him .
