<p> ATHENS , Ga .  --  Pots of begonias and petunias hang from porches that could use some work . Painted chicken feeders blossom with zinnias and red salvia . These yards  --  swept clean with a broom made of dogwood branches  --  have no grass . <p> They do n't look like much at first glance . But hidden in their unconscious design are traces of West Africa and the emergence of a hard-won independence . <p> African-Americans here , many of them descendants of slaves brought mainly from West Africa to chop cotton in Georgia 's hard clay , are carrying on the traditions that their ancestors brought from the Gold Coast  --  everything from cooking and washing outdoors to sharing the latest gossip under a shade tree . <p> But these yards and the life they hold are fast disappearing , as the people who have long tended them grow old and their children move on . <p> The design of these yards  --  a church pew under the trees , an old bedspring gate on the hog pen , a clump of irises blooming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generations of making do and making art out of what others call junk . <p> The swept yard was the most important " " room " of the household , the heart of the home . Slave quarters were cramped and hot . So you washed and cooked outside , and when the meal was over , everything could be swept into the fire . <p> Sixteen years ago , when Richard Westmacott , an Englishman , came to Athens to teach landscape architecture at the University of Georgia , he and his wife , Jean , moved into an abandoned pre-Civil War house in rural Oglethorpe County , about 20 miles east of town . <p> In visiting the gardens of his neighbors , he realized , like some latter-day de Tocqueville , that what the local people took for granted was the embodiment of a fast-disappearing culture . <p> " " I have no doubt that the swept yard did come from Africa  - -  and then was adopted by white folks , " said Westmacott , whose book , " " African-American Gardens and Yards in the Rural South , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had swept yards , including the plantations , which were swept by slaves or servants . " <p> A garden in these parts , by the way , is where you grow vegetables ; a yard is for your flowers and shrubs . <p> People swept their yards long before the age of mowers , and nobody liked grass . <p> " " Any weed was called grass , " Westmacott said . " " And people battled against it because cotton did n't compete well with weeds . " <p> On a hot summer 's day in July , Lucille Sanders stood in her bare feet on the cool , sandy dirt , under the shade of pine trees , where the late afternoon light cast cathedrallike shadows on the bare ground . <p> " " I just put up 25 quarts of string beans and 20 quarts of tomatoes , " said Sanders , a trim woman of 70 with short white curls . " " We ai n't gon na have no corn . The drought got it . " She stared at the sun-bleached boards of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this 28 years ago , " she said . " " Cut the pine trees , hauled them to a sawmill for the lumber . We used to have four or five cows , but we got rid of those a couple years ago . We could n't raise the feed for them . " <p> They used to have hogs , too . " " Had a little old pit over there where we 'd scald ' em and clean ' em , " she said . <p> A hog was not just a hog to an enslaved African . It was a corner on life , itself . <p> " " What distinguished a good slave owner from a bad one was things like whether or not you were allowed to keep a hog or chickens , " Westmacott said . So every hog raised , or row of beans planted after working from dawn to dusk in the master 's field , was a scrap of independence . <p> Sanders 's six children helped make syrup from sugar cane and raised wheat and corn to be ground into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those days . <p> " " If a family reunion was coming up , we 'd go from one house to another , cleaning up , " she said . " " We 'd help kill the hogs and get the crops in . I liked that life . I wish something like that would happen now . It seems like people do n't eat together no more . " <p> But it was that sense of community that helped people to survive slavery and sharecropping , the ravages of the boll weevil and drought . <p> Sanders 's husband , Ed , had a stroke a few years back , so now he spends afternoons on the porch with a few of his 14 grandchildren . They often visit from town  --  but nobody wants to farm . <p> It 's the same story all over Oglethorpe County . The pens that once held animals for food and work , the old hoists and sawed-off oil drums used for scalding the hogs , the wellheads where the women cooked and made soap  --  they all now have the abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are full of pokeweed and thistle . <p> Westmacott 's book , which examines the traditions and folk art of these African-American gardeners , is the result of his travels through rural Georgia , Alabama and South Carolina . His photographs capture a society that is fast disappearing , as children move to the cities for work and buy their vegetables at the supermarket . <p> His book also includes photographs of villages in West Africa , taken at the turn of the century , that show striking similarities to the swept yards of the South . <p> Swept yards are so familiar to some that they have become invisible . " " When you grow up around something , you do n't think of it as a subject to be interpreted , " said Theresa Singleton , the curator of historical archeology at the Smithsonian Institution , who was raised in South Carolina . " " But how people organize their space is essential to understanding how they live . And this type of gardening style is certainly one you can identify with black Southerners . " African slaves brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a style of planting that had nothing to do with rows or hedges . <p> " " The plants are all mixed up from a North American perspective , " said Dr. Lydia Mihelic Pulsipher , a professor of geography at the University of Tennessee , who has studied slave gardens in the Caribbean , which are a blend of African and West Indian traditions . " " But plants have lots of different uses , and a lot of where they 're put is practical . The West Indians plant an herb they call the pot scrubber bush  --  it 's in the daisy family , and it has a very abrasive leaf  --  wherever they clean up the kitchen stuff , which is usually under a tree in the yard . <p> " " The Africans understood the niche each plant fit in the ecosystem , so they 'd seek out places in their yards that fit the requirements of a certain plant , " Pulsipher continued . " " The phrase the West Indians have is " Put them where they wo n't trouble each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The plants are seen as individuals that are not to be merged with everything else . " Certainly , cost figures into the picture . <p> " " Several gardeners said that shrubbery was too expensive , or that they could only afford just one of something , " Westmacott said . <p> But he added that his closest neighbor , Magnolia Moses , had commented that " " white people 's gardens are all shaped up , " referring to hedges and foundation plantings . " " And I have a feeling if you gave Magnolia $ 20 and said , " You have to spend this on plants , ' she 'd buy lots of different plants . There 's a kind of playful inventiveness in African-American yards that parallels their improvisation in music and the decorative arts , like quilt-making . " Eloise Cook stood in the semishade of her carport in Athens and fingered the succulent leaf of a night-blooming cereus . " " You have one of these ? I 'll give you one , " she said . <p> Plants hung from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she discussed each one as if it were a personal friend . <p> " " Now Creeping Charley do n't favor me at all , " said Cook , 71 . But other plants , like the salvia in her front yard , self-seeds like crazy . When friends ask why everything " " volunteers " in her yard and not theirs , she just says , " " It 's because the Lord knows I be giving it to somebody , saying , " Honey , come get some flowers . ' " <p> Most of the people Westmacott talked to denied that their gardening traditions came from Africa . " " I do n't know nothing about Africa , no kind of way , " Ellen Bolton told him . Many are devout Christians , and they were reluctant , he said , to talk about African influences that may appear contrary to their religious beliefs . <p> When he asked why they swept their yards , gardeners simply said that their mothers and grandmothers did it that way . <p> " " It comes from way back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under some oak trees . " " My mother  --  she was 90 when she passed  --  would sweep the yard with a brush broom we made out of dogwood , " Appling said . She was born in the house where she still lives . Her father was a sharecropper , and in the evenings , everybody sat out in the yard . <p> " " You could n't stay in the house because we did n't have a fan , " Appling said . " " Sometimes at night , we 'd sit out here and eat watermelon . " <p> No scrap of metal or glass is considered too humble for use , like using colored bottles to line a walk or nailing hubcaps together to decorate a front gate . And some things , like the stone tables built from slabs of granite lugged from Georgian quarries where the men worked , have a beauty as ageless as Stonehenge . <p> Some have great whimsy . Like the the concrete steps that Cook poured , herself , and then inscribed with a stick , " " Started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mailbox that she elevated on concrete blocks , decorating the holes with figurines ; the leaky birdbath she turned into art , with some begonias and a couple of fake chickens . <p> " " That old birdbath had cracked , and I said , " I know what to do , I 'll put them chickens and begonias in there , " ' Cook said . <p> " " Then I made me a new birdbath out of a garbage can top , and I said , " Let me see you all break this .
