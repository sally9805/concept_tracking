The boys glumly watched as twelve of their chums boarded the train for Camp Ochicumweekee , an expensive boys ' camp in the White Mountains , where they were promised " a thrill a day . " Why ca n't we go camping ? " Andy asked . " I know a dandy place , with a mill pond and everything , about half a day 's hike from here . It wo n't cost us anything except what we 'd eat . " Andy grew excited remembering the days when he lived near the gristmill , when water rushed over the dam and filled a magnificent pond . All the boys agreed enthusiastically . When the boys hiked over to the old mill pond for several days of camping , they were disappointed to find the so-called pond dried up and the original basin rush-grown and grassy . Making the best of a bad situation , they started mending the dam in the hopes that the nearby stream would flood the pond bed and give them enough water for swimming . Slim , the quiet , bookish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When they assigned him the camp duty of being lifesaver , he realized that this was a ridiculous chore . The pond had so little water in it that they nicknamed it Thimble Pond . But Slim was eager to prove his worth to his friends and began work on a lifesaving device , an invention of his own . That night , as the boys were sleeping in the old mill shed , a thunderstorm blew in , and a loud , horrible groan woke them up . " It must be Bill , " cried Nick . " He was over in that corner . And he 's gone . Something must have happened to him . " " Get up , Slim ! " screamed Andy . " Get up ! Help ! Help us find him ! " " Help ! " Cupe joined in . " Everybody 's got to help find Bill ! " But Slim sat motionless . He simply could not move . His arms and legs felt as useless as iron or melted butter . The others ran to the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Slim could not stir . He wanted to think . But how could he do that with that terrible din in his ears ? Something had happened to Bill-and he could n't rouse himself to go help him . A great lifeguard he 'd be ! Oh , how he hated himself , and how the other boys must despise him . He was yellow clear through , that was most certain . Tomorrow he 'd better sneak home . But if he did , he would never have a chance to try out the invention he 'd made with the can and the piece of rubber hose he 'd found . He would help find Bill ! With a mighty effort , Slim brought his muscles into operation and got onto his feet . He was no further along than that when the chattering boys returned , stamping and shaking the rain from their scanty clothing . Bill was with them and emerged from his woolen blanket dry and comfortable , though still sleepy . " What 'd you wake me up to come in here and listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd rather take my chances on drowning outdoors than roasting in here . Sure , I went out on purpose . A fellow has to breathe . But what 's the noise ? Slim invented a motor or something ? " Slim had n't invented anything , but being able to walk now , he had investigated and could explain the awful din . " Water 's coming through that millrace at about forty horsepower a minute . Bill was fooling around here this afternoon , and he must have put everything in circuit , for the whole mill is running full blast . It 's somewhat rusty , but all is present and we ca n't stop it till daylight . " Disgusted in Bill 's smug pride in his unwitting achievement , but comforted by the thought that they had at least one thrill to describe to the Ochicumweekee boys , they settled down once more and soon became accustomed to the noise . Slim wished they had said something about his being a coward . If it had been any other boy they would n't have lost any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not expect much of him at all . In this thought , Slim was closer to being right . Except for an occasional jibe at his carefully groomed hair , they were never unkind to him during the next few days . He swam with them in the now-swollen millpond . He hiked with them , often footsore and winded . He grumbled with them over the distasteful camp chores and the fate which denied them a regular boys ' camp . Yet he made no headway in gaining their real affection . Then , one day , an opportunity presented itself . " Help ! Help ! " For a moment , Slim could not believe his ears . He seemed glued to the worn old doorstep where he sat mending his extra trousers . " Help ! " The call he had waited for these five days ! His chance to make good , to show them ! The blood pounded deafeningly in Slims ears as he ran to the strip of bank they had sanded and called a " beach . " Vaguely he knew there were boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were watching him . But all he really saw was a khaki shirt bobbing up and down in the middle of the pond . With a long practiced kick , he threw off his shoes . Mechanically he reached for the bean can and hose , the lifesaving headset he had devised . How the boys had jollied him about it because he wore it constantly at his belt ! He would prove its value now . With a clean , swift stroke , Slim made his way through the water , never losing sight of that khaki shirt . He wondered if it was Bill or Cupe . Probably the latter , gone in too soon after a hearty dinner . But why did n't he sink ? He was almost in reach when-there ! He was gone . Slim adjusted the headset , tube in mouth , and dived after him . He came up in a moment , grasping an empty shirt . Attached to it was a string that led to the shore and Andy . The boy felt himself grow weak and limp . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have known he 'd never have a chance to be a real hero . It was mean of them-no , he was just disappointed , that was all . He shivered a little as he reached the shore and faced the cheers and congratulations of his mates . " Shame to get you so wet , Slim . " " We just had to find out how that nose bag worked . " " Wanted you to have a chance at the lifeguard business . Cupe was jumping up and down delightedly on the long springboard they had made from a loose flooring plank . " Some rescue , Slim ! We had n't had a thrill since the night the water wheel started . Wait till the White Mountain boys hear this ! Oh , I tell you , it was funny ! " He doubled over in renewed laughter . Slim carefully shook out the folds of the shirt , which had proven to be his own . Suddenly there was a snapping noise . Cupe and the springboard disappeared into the diving hole , and a howl of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They waited for Cupe to reappear , to tell him how much they enjoyed his backward dive . But Cupe did not appear . Bits of the broken , rotten plank bobbed up , but not a sign of Cupe . Andy paled . " What 's happened , do you suppose ? " he asked , his voice trembling . " M-maybe he 's doing that underwater swim , " Tim suggested . But Slim did n't think so . " You 'll have to stand by to help , " he ordered . They all stood by , but they were no help . Before they realized it , their lifeguard was in the water again . His headset was in place , and its tin can was floating behind him . Then they saw Slim dive . He dived again and again in the spot where they last had seen Cupe . Awestruck , they watched him . It seemed hours before he found Cupe and hours more before he made Nick understand that he must come and help . By then , he was almost on shore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together they got Cupe onto the beach . Andy and Bill and Tim watched helplessly while the first-aid work went on . No one spoke a word for a good ten minutes . Then Nick said , " It 's no use , Slim . You 've done your best . " Slim worked on . Nick tried to draw him away . But Slim threw him off fiercely . Nick tried to explain . " I tell you , Slim , he must have hit his head . He-he did n't drown . It 's not your fault . You 've done all you can . " Slim hesitated for a moment . He was nearly exhausted . " We ca n't give up yet . Wait ! " It was n't long then before a change came over Cupe , and he began to breathe naturally . Slim stood up , his eyes ablaze with the joy of his first big victory . " Now run , Andy ! Run over to the farmhouse and bring help . And , Tim , bring my blankets . " Andy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Jackson , a neighbor , there in a short time , and Cupe began to feel more like his old self again . " It 's a good thing he 's so well upholstered , " Mr. Jackson said , laughing . " I 'll take him home with me to keep him warm a couple of days , and he 'll be fit as ever . Now where 's the youngster that did the rescuing ? " They found him after a while , around in back of the gristmill , combing his hair . The man gave the lean boy a hearty handshake . " You may not be very much in inches upward or across chest , young feller , but you 're all man , and I 'm proud to know you . There is n't one in a thousand would have known enough and had grit enough to keep on the job as you did . You 're in line for a hero 's medal . " " And that is n't all- " Andy was almost blubbering . " We 'd been-kidding him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cupe fell in . " " Oh , forget it ! " Slim growled . " It was my shirt , was n't it ? And it needed washing , did n't it ? " " This is a neat job , too . Was it all your idea ? " Mr. Jackson asked after Tim had explained the workings of Slims diving device . " Oh , it did n't help much , " Slim said modestly , " but I could make one that would . This is awfully crude . " " But the principle is there , and it 's clever . I know a man I believe can make something of it . And if he can-well , we wo n't forget you . " * The boys stood by as Mr. Jackson took down some notes in a little book , their very silence expressive of the awe and affection in which they held their comrade . The man took a great interest then in their pond and the many improvements they had made " Fine ! Fine ! " he said as they finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you something better . Come over to my camp at Lake Raponda for the rest of your vacation . There 's really good swimming and fishing there , and no mosquitoes . Good snug cottage , plenty of dishes and beds . How about it ? " The boys held a whispered consultation in which Cupe was allowed to join . The verdict was unanimous . " It 's mighty good of you to invite us , and we 're very grateful , but-I do n't know- " Andy swallowed hard . " We guess we 'd rather stay here . There are lots of-well , thrills , sort of , running a place like Thimble Camp . " Author Affiliation * 1lim diving device is too danger to try at home . // <p>
