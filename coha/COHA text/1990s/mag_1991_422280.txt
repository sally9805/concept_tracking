Section : Articles QUIS CUSTODIET ? Democrats are outraged at Republicans over BCCI . Is sanctimony the first refuge of the guilty ? <p> SENATOR John Kerry ( D. , Mass. ) is currently a Washington hero for uncovering the nefarious deeds of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International . The villains  --  the folks being investigated in Congress and savaged in the press  --  are Justice Department and Federal Reserve functionaries who supposedly failed to crack down on the bank . <p> But how heroic is Senator Kerry really ? When his investigation got too close , BCCI shut it down with relative ease . How it did so illustrates something about how Washington works . <p> In 1988 , Panamanian defector Jose Blandon , formerly Manuel Noriega 's right-hand man , testified that Colombian drug money was being laundered by BCCI in Panama and the United States . Kerry 's subcommittee  --  the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on terrorism , narcotics , and international operations  --  voted to subpoena BCCI 's records on its Panama operations and summon BCCI officials to testify . Had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut down three years ago  --  with many millions of depositors ' money saved . <p> But there were two major delays . The first has been well publicized . Congressional action was postponed several months to avoid compromising a Customs - Justice Department undercover investigation of the bank 's money laundering . That investigation duly produced eight arrests of BCCI employees in Tampa in October 1988 . <p> The second delay was more serious and less justified . When subpoenas were issued to bring documents and witnesses before the committee , Clark Clifford  --  Democratic elder statesman , sometime lawyer for BCCI , and Chairman of First American ( a U.S. bank secretly and illegally owned by BCCI )  --  took evasive action . In August of 1988 , he convinced Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Claiborne Pell ( D. , R.I. ) to extend the subpoena deadline . Next , he visited Kerry , shortly before hearings were due to begin in September . Kerry 's office claims Clifford simply assured the senator that BCCI was squeaky clean and happy to cooperate . Even if that were so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's testimony and reports his staff had collected about BCCI 's ownership of First American . <p> In any case , after Clifford 's visit , Kerry canceled the planned hearings ; they were never rescheduled . The following spring , for reasons which are still mysterious , Kerry dismissed Jack Blum , his chief investigator . Blum  --  a portly fifty-year-old attorney , a veteran of the Senate 's ITT - Chile investigation of the Seventies , variously described by co-workers of both parties as a Sherlock Holmes and an Inspector Clouseau  --  went on to help Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau break the BCCI case . <p> John Kerry is an ambitious man . Had he kept the investigation alive , it would have boosted his career tremendously . Instead , for over two years he made desultory attempts to get First American to deliver the subpoenaed documents . Only when other investigators  --  the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England as well as Morgenthau  --  came out with fines and indictments did he manage to hold further hearings , in August of 1991 . Why did Kerry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to view his subcommittee 's investigations as a political football . When he brought Blum on board in early 1987 , he was probing for evidence of drug- running by the anti-Communist Nicaraguan resistance . Geryld Christianson , Claiborne Pell 's chief staffer for the Foreign Relations Committee , says that though Pell had a philosophical aversion to having investigations done by his committee , ' he agreed to fund Kerry 's probe to see whether or not President Reagan may have been suppressing law enforcement for foreign- policy considerations . ' <p> Kerry and Blum spent a year tracking down every leftist conspiracy theory along these lines , including the bizarre claims , emanating from the far-Left Christic Institute , of a thirty-year CIA-run drug ring that virtually controls the U.S. Government . The claims would later be smirked at even by Mother Jones . Having spent over a hundred thousand dollars to bring an assortment of Latin American rogues and Communists to Washington , to absolutely no avail , Kerry was becoming a laughing-stock , attacked by Republican subcommittee members like Mitch McConnell ( R. , Ky. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and losing the respect and trust of his own party . <p> This is not how congressional investigations are supposed to work . According to the conventional scenario , based on Watergate , the bizarre accusations and questionable testimony are picked up by the press , repeated , perhaps even substantiated . The committee 's subpoena power and the press 's lack of responsibility combine for maximum information gathering or innuendo mongering , while the committee 's official imprimatur and the press 's nominal objectivity lend credibility to the allegations . But Kerry had chased rumors too absurd even for Washington . In a city where appearance is all , this is fatal . <p> In part , Kerry had fallen prey to the intrinsic problem of conspiracy theories : the overwhelming majority of them are not true , and Occam 's Razor will reject the true-but-improbable along with the false . A good investigator is part genius , part crank : to ferret out one genuine conspiracy , he will pursue a thousand imagined ones . Jack Blum fits the bill . <p> Flights of Fancy <p> BLUM AND Kerry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blum finally listened to the staff of Senator Jesse Helms ( R. , N.C. ) , who say they had been steering him away from the Christic lunacy and toward investigations which they had been engaged in , and which Senator Christopher Dodd ( D. , Conn. ) declined to pursue when the Democrats gained control of the Senate in 1986 . It was these staffers who put him in touch with Jose Blandon . In other words , the only real breakthrough John Kerry ever provided on BCCI was actually supplied to him by the Left 's bete noire , Jesse Helms . <p> With their funds and credibility running out , Blum and Kerry now scheduled hearings with Blandon  --  and they struck paydirt , linking Noriega to the Colombian cocaine cartels . They only incidentally stumbled on BCCI , the middleman . More enticing was other testimony linking Noriega to the CIA  --  which all good conspiracy theorists know is linked to George Bush . Pell duly authorized Kerry 's investigations for another year . <p> Later , when the hearings began to go the wrong way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . He blames Blum for delaying the subpoenas for four months ( as requested by the Justice Department ) , pointing out that he and Pell only gave BCCI a one-month extension . Anyway , how long can you drag investigations out ? Someone like Jack would still be investigating today because he would get sidetracked . ' On the other hand , says Christianson , if some vital earth-shaking revelation had been produced by Blum 's investigation , Senator Pell would have extended it ' for another budget year . A reasonable interpretation is that Pell was willing to reauthorize hearings in 1988 because any charge could be believed of Reagan , Bush , and the Contras . Not so of BCCI and Clark Clifford in 1989 . <p> Meanwhile , Blum did get somewhere by proceeding on his own . According to documents filed in Miami Federal District Court , at the time Kerry canceled the September 1988 hearings , Blum had enough to make Clark Clifford very nervous indeed . Noriega 's banker , Amjad Awan of BCCI 's Tampa branch , told an undercover Customs agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuaded and aided him to attempt to leave the country to avoid a subpoena . Before Awan could leave , he was caught by the October 1988 Customs - Justice sting against BCCI/Tampa . Clifford and Altman have denied telling Awan to flee ( obstructing a congressional investigation would constitute a felony ) . <p> Kerry 's justification to Blum for canceling those hearings , says Blum , was that partisan politics would paralyze the committee during an election year : with Noriega as a major issue in the presidential campaign , Senator Kerry thought the political environment was too tough . ' But this explanation is feeble : not only was Noriega never a major campaign issue , but Kerry 's probe was becoming bipartisan , the BCCI - Clifford connection replacing the Noriega - CIA - Bush one . To be sure , Kerry and Blum violated bipartisan protocol by failing to inform Republican committee members and staff that they had uncovered this second front . Eric Felton reports in the September 9 , 1991 , Insight that , when deposing Awan on September 30 , 1988 , Blum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to flee the country  --  even though he was aware that Awan could give testimony damning Clifford . <p> In short , Kerry chased every Republican will-o ' - the- wisp , but only stumbled over BCCI . And when a continued investigation threatened his own party , he began to go slow . This would explain his readiness to drop an investigation that he had originally hoped would make his name , just when it was finally on point of coming up with the goods . <p> But there is also evidence that the fall of BCCI would have hurt Kerry 's career directly . Clark Clifford , Robert Altman , and another law partner donated $4,000 to Senator Kerry and $1,000 to Senator Pell in early 1989  --  long after Clifford visited Kerry as BCCI 's lawyer-lobbyist , long after Kerry had heard of the secret links between Clifford and BCCI . Insight 's Eric Felton makes the additional point that Senator Kerry 's impropriety  --  receiving a donation from someone under suspicion in his own investigating  --  can not be put down to botched staff communications : Kerry met Clifford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his 1989 - 90 re-election campaign , so he was presumably alerted to the possibility of a contribution . <p> Moreover , for the 1987 - 88 election cycle Kerry served as Chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee ( DSCC ) , the Senate Democrats ' very own political-action committee . In that capacity , he appointed David L. Paul , the head of CenTrust , a high-flying Florida savings and loan , as head of the DSCC 's Majority Trust  --  the private-sector partner ' who could deliver the money . <p> CenTrust was closed by federal regulators in early 1990 at a cost to taxpayers of over $2 billion . That is bad enough . But it has now been established that BCCI had a tentacle in CenTrust : Ghaith Pharaon , the Saudi who had already served as a front man when BCCI acquired The National Bank of Georgia ( later to become First American ) from Bert Lance , Jimmy Carter 's budget director . The Federal Reserve cited three major reasons for the record $200-million fine it levied against BCCI this year . One was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related to CenTrust . <p> The Fed noted BCCI 's hidden ownership , through Pharaon , of at least 5 per cent of CenTrust stock as of April 14 , 1989 . BCCI apparently wanted control of a Miami bank to expand its money-laundering operations . First American was not well located for that purpose . According to a subsequent , limited investigation of the BCCI - CenTrust connection by James G. Phillips for Senator Orrin Hatch ( R. , Utah ) , by the time federal regulators shut CenTrust 's doors in 1990 , BCCI had acquired at least 28 per cent of its stock  --  which constitutes legal control under federal law . Senator Howard Metzenbaum ( D. , Ohio ) , who has apparently declined to hold hearings on the Hatch report , received a $1,000 donation from CenTrust in 1987 . <p> The Fed 's second charge concerned BCCI 's illegal parking ' of some $25 million in CenTrust bonds in mid 1988 . Pharaon had petitioned regulators to keep CenTrust open ; they agreed on condition that the thrift immediately beef up its vanishing capital base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly , but succeeded in selling only $150 million , including $25 million to BCCI . Two months later , CenTrust bought the bonds back from BCCI at par value . It also bought back the other investors ' $125 million in bonds ; the other investors , however , got only 62 cents on the dollar . The Federal Reserve determined that the $25 million was merely parked ' at CenTrust long enough to fool the regulators . <p> Indeed , CenTrust , BCCI , and the Democrats seem to have been one big , happy family . CenTrust donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democrats in PAC money alone . In addition , I have discovered that the non-political ' CenTrust Foundation also poured cash into Democratic coffers , including $100,000 to the now notorious ( Jimmy ) Carter Center ( of which $50,000 came from Pharaon and was merely laundered through CenTrust ) and $25,000 in 1989 to Senator Alan Cranston 's Center for Participation in Democracy , also the prime beneficiary of Cranston 's friendship with Charles Keating . Beginning in January 1989 , CenTrust also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heading overcoming regulatory issues ' with federal bank investigators . In January 1989 , Wilson donated $1,000 to Senator Kerry . <p> David Paul was personally very much involved in this largesse . He threw fundraisers for the Democrats on his thrift 's $7-million yacht . He gave them free rides on his corporate jet . And , in an event extraordinary even for what Democrats call the Decade of Greed , he invited Senators John Kerry and Wyche Fowler ( a Georgia Democrat and another friend of CenTrust ) to his December 1988 French Chefs gala dinner , for which six chefs were flown in from Paris to provide a feast costing $123,000  --  all expenses paid by CenTrust . <p> So , as a senator running for re-election , John Kerry received donations directly from Clark Clifford , who was a BCCI attorney and former chairman of a bank secretly and illegally owned by BCCI . As chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee , he raised funds in close cooperation with David Paul , whose thrift was deeply enmeshed with BCCI . As a subcommittee chairman , Kerry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international rogue . <p> It becomes terribly painful for senators to go after these guys who gave them all the money , ' says Jack Blum . Later they may be faced with the choice of doing nothing or doing something to upset a major funding source . ' In the end , all too often it becomes too easy to do nothing . ' <p> Senator Kerry is an extremely lucky man . If he were a Republican , all this might amount to a scandal . <p> CARTOON : ( UNKNOWN ) <p> By ROBERT S.
