<p> The United Nations defied Serb guns Monday and braved a run into Sarajevo to bring the besieged city enough flour for a day 's bread . <p> It was a desperate attempt to squeeze something through the Serbs ' chokehold on aid deliveries to the Bosnian capital and other beleaguered enclaves . <p> But U.N . officials again stressed they would be unlikely to use force to get aid to the hungry as long as Serbs continue to hold 144 U.N . peacekeepers . <p> The commander of U.N . forces in Bosnia , Lt. Gen. Rupert Smith , has outlined plans to pry open aid routes to Sarajevo , where warehouses are empty for the first time in the three-year war . <p> " The question now is , is now the time to do that ? " said U.N . spokesman Fred Eckhard . Asked whether that meant the United Nations could only sit with its hands folded until all hostages are freed , Eckhard replied : " Essentially , yes . " <p> " The patience and ability to take a fair amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The U.N . attitude and the West 's decision to form a rapid reaction force of up to 10,000 troops that would protect U.N . peacekeepers rather than force open aid routes have angered the Bosnian government . <p> " It is better for these forces to leave Bosnia because we do not want international forces which defend themselves in our country , " Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic was quoted as saying Monday . <p> Frustrated at the lack of a peace settlement , the Muslim-led government increasingly would rather settle scores on the battlefield . Over the weekend , it met with allied Croat militias to coordinate strategy . <p> " My confidence in my army is greater than my confidence in any decisions or political steps from the international community , " Izetbegovic said . <p> Front lines have heated up again and the government claimed over the weekend to have made several advances . <p> Those gains prompted Gen. Ratko Mladic , the Bosnian Serb commander , to warn the United Nations to expect more aid restrictions for the eastern Muslim enclaves unless government forces withdraw from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lt. Col. Gary Coward , played down the threat , noting no convoys have been allowed into Gorazde for three weeks anyway . <p> Serbs seized more than 370 peacekeepers after NATO warplanes bombed Serb ammunition dumps in Bosnia last month . They have released 233 , but still hold 144 , according to U.N . figures . <p> There were signs Monday that more could be released this week . <p> " Tomorrow we will make public the plan of freeing all members of UNPROFOR ( U.N . peacekeepers ) , " Momcilo Krajisnik , a Bosnian Serb leader , was quoted as saying by the Serb news agency SRNA . <p> Also Monday , Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic 's security chief , Jovica Stanisic , who mediated two previous hostage releases , departed for the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale , outside of Sarajevo . <p> Serbs last week promised to allow aid through their territory to Sarajevo and the enclaves , but have blocked all but one convoy . <p> One aid truck for the eastern enclave of Zepa was held up for three days by Serbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truck was sealed when it left Belgrade , and suggested the ammunition was planted . <p> Serbs agreed to let the first convoy in more than three weeks into Sarajevo on Tuesday , but said it must use an untested route and a Serb escort . <p> Monday 's flour delivery by the United Nations was part of a stopgap plan that would never meet the needs of Sarajevo 's 280,000 residents . The 30,000 tons of flour brought in were only enough for one day of bread . <p> Unprepared to risk the treacherous route over Mount Igman , southwest of the city , which is often targeted by Serb big guns , the United Nations dropped the wheat flour off with the Bosnian government outside Sarajevo . <p> At night , government trucks took the aid over Igman . U.N . trucks completed delivery Monday by taking the aid across the U.N.-controlled airport , a crossing targeted by Serb guns . <p> Bosnia 's war began in April 1992 with a Serb rebellion . Serbs now hold 70 percent of the country . <p> After lunch with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capt . Scott O'Grady was treated to a hero 's welcome at the Pentagon on Monday . President Clinton called him " a reminder of what is very best about our country . " <p> O'Grady 's fancy meal at the White House , hosted by Clinton and attended by the fighter pilot 's parents , grandparents , brother and sister , was a far cry from his diet of insects and plants after being shot down in his F-16 over Bosnia on June 2 . <p> They feasted in private in the president 's residence on grilled vegetable gazpacho and lump crab meat salad , lamb chops with layered potatoes and mushrooms , spring greens and asparagus , followed by cherry sherbet and fresh fruits . <p> Surveying the spread , O'Grady , a native of Spokane , Wash. , cracked : " You 'll understand , Mr. President , if I do n't eat the salad . " <p> " He certifies that he got a better meal than he did in those six days in Bosnia , " Clinton joked later at a rain-soaked welcoming ceremony on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brass paid tribute not only to O'Grady 's courage and spirit but also to the skill and training of those who rescued him . <p> " Last week those of you who brought life to that training and saved one brave man 's life said more about what we stand for as a country , what our values are and what our commitments are than any words the rest of us could ever utter , " Clinton said . <p> The president said he felt personally honored to have O'Grady and his family to lunch . <p> " He gave us something more precious than we can ever give him : a reminder of what is very best about our country . " <p> As if on cue , a driving rain and wind eased and the skies lightened just as O'Grady , in his blue Air Force uniform , accompanied by Clinton , Defense Secretary William Perry and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. John Shalikashvili , walked out of the Pentagon to an outdoor platform overlooking the Potomac . <p> " We 're here today to celebrate true grit , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not his spirit . " <p> Perry recalled the moment , in the early morning hours of last Thursday in Bosnia , when U.S. commanders got the initial confirmation that O'Grady was alive and had been located . They had hoped to be able to attempt their rescue mission in darkness when night-vision equipment would give them the advantage of stealth . But in fact they had to choose whether to go right away in daylight , or wait until the next night and hope O'Grady would not be captured first . <p> They chose to go in daylight . <p> " It was a gutsy decision , " Perry said . " It turned out to be the right decision . " <p> For his part , O'Grady said little . He thanked God and the men who rescued him . The 29-year-old captain said he found it hard to accept all the publicity he has received . <p> " I just can not believe this response . It 's overwhelming and it 's still unreal in my mind , " O'Grady said . <p> He said he preferred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those men and women who deserved it more , and did n't get it , " such as prisoners of war , those in uniform who died in wartime and peacetime , and United Nations peacekeepers . <p> " The greatest gift anybody could ever give me would be , if you know anybody " who has served in uniform or is serving now , " to go up to them and thank them for what they 're doing for trying to make this world a better place , " he said .
