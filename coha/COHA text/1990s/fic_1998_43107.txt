Oh my , this issue seems to be heralding winter with more darkness than lightincluding the compelling entomological fantasy that follows . Fortunately , Dale Bailey has a bit of good news to shine into the gloom : he reports that he and his wife lean expect to become parents soon . Says Dale , " I 'm hoping to handle imminent fatherhood with a little more aplomb than Gerald Hartshorn , but needless to say , the ongoing experience casts the story in a new light for me ... " In other words : parents-to-be , do n't try this at home . <p> AFTER THE EXAMINATION , they gathered in the office of the physician , an obstetrician named Exavious that a friend of Sara 's had recommended . Dr. Exavious specialized in what Sara termed " high-risk pregnancies , " which Gerald Hartshorn took to mean that his wife , at thirty-seven , was too old to be having babies . Secretly , Gerald thought of his wife 's ... condition ... not as a natural biological process , but as a disease : as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't wish to think of it - as fatal . During the last weeks , a seed of fear Gerald had buried almost ten years ago - buried and forgotten , he had believed - had at last begun to germinate , to spread hungry tendrils in the rich loam of his heart , to feed . And now , such thoughts so preoccupied him that Gerald only halflistened as Dr. Exavious reassured Sara . " We have made great strides in bringing to term women of your age , " he was saying , " especially women in such superb condition as I have found you to be ... " These words , spoken in the obscurely accented English which communicated an aura of medical expertise to men of Gerald 's class ( white , affluent , conservative , and , above all , coddled by a network of expensive specialists )  --  these words should have comforted him . They did not . Specialist or not , the fact remained that Gerald did n't like Exavious , slim and Arabic , with febrile eyes and a mustache like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gerald did n't like much of anything about this ... situation . Most of all , he did n't like being left alone with the doctor when Sara excused herself at the end of the meeting . He laced his fingers in his lap and gazed off into a corner , uncertain how to proceed . " These times can be difficult for a woman , " Exavious said . " There are many pressures , you understand , not least on the kidneys . " Gerald allowed himself a polite smile : recognition of the intended humor , nothing more . He studied the office-immaculate carpet , desk of dark expensive wood , diplomas mounted neatly on one wall - but saw no clock . Beyond tinted windows , the parking lot shimmered with midsummer heat . Julian would be nuts at the office . But he did n't see how he could steal a glance at his watch without being rude . Exavious leaned forward and said , " So you are to be a father . You must be very happy , Mr. Hartshom . " Gerald folded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sure . " " If you have further questions , questions I have n't answered , I 'd be happy to ... " He let the rest of the sentence hang , unspoken , in the air . " I know this can be a trying experience for some men . " " I 'm just a bit nervous , that 's all . " " Ah . And why is that ? " " Well , her history , you know . " Exavious smiled . He waved a hand dismissively . " Such incidents are not uncommon , Mr. Hartshorn , as I 'm sure you know . Your wife is quite healthy . Physiologically , she is twenty-five . You have nothing to fear . " Exavious sighed ; he toyed with a lucite pyramid in which a vaguely alien-looking model of a fetus had been embedded . The name of a drug company had been imprinted in black around its base . " There is one thing , however . " Gerald swallowed . A slight pressure constricted his lungs . " What 's that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the history you mentioned . She indicated these during the examination  --  that 's why she came to me in the first place . Emotional states can have unforeseen physiological effects . They can heighten the difficulty of a pregnancy . Most doctors do n't like to admit it , but the fact is we understand very little about the mind-body relationship . However , one thing is clear : your wife 's emotional condition is every bit as important as her physical state . " Exavious paused . Some vagary of the air-conditioning swirled to Gerald 's nostrils a hint of his after-shave lotion . " I guess I do n't really understand , " Gerald said . " I 'm just trying to emphasize that your wife will need your support , Mr. Hartshorn . That 's all . " " Are you suggesting that I would n't be supportive ? " " Of course not . I merely noticed that- " " I do n't know what you noticed , but it sounds to me - " " Mr. Hartshorn , please . " " - like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . You bet I 'm nervous . Anyone in my circumstances would be . But that does n't mean I wo n't be supportive . " In the midst of this speech , Gerald found himself on his feet , a hot blush rising under his collar . " I do n't know what you 're suggest-ing- " he continued , and then , when Exavious winced and lifted his hands palms outward , he consciously lowered his voice . " I do n't know what you 're suggesting - " " Mr. Hartshorn , please . My intent was not to offend . I understand that you are fearful for your wife . I am simply trying to tell you that she must not be allowed to perceive that you too are afraid . " Gerald drew in a long breath . He sat , feeling sheepish . " I 'm sorry , it 's ... I 've been under a lot of pressure at work lately . I do n't know what came over me . " Exavious inclined his head . " Mr. Hartshorn , I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small favor - for your sake and for your wife 's ? " " Sure , please . " " Just this : take some time , Mr. Hartshorn , take some time and think . Are you fearful for your wife 's welfare , or are you fearful for your own ? " Just then , before Gerald could reply , the door from the corridor opened and Sara came in , her long body as yet unblemished by the child within . She brushed back a wisp of blonde hair as Gerald turned to face her . " Gerald , are you okay ? I thought I heard your- " " Please , Mrs. Hartshorn , there was nothing , " the doctor said warmly . " Is that not correct , Mr. Hartshorn ? Nothing , nothing at all . " And somehow Gerald recovered himself enough to accede to this simple deception as the doctor ushered them into the corridor . Outside , while Sara spoke with the receptionist , he turned at a feathery touch on his shoulder . Dr. Exavious enveloped his hand and gazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and then Gerald wrenched himself away , feeling naked and exposed , as if those febrile eyes had illuminated the hollows of his soul , as if he too had been subjected to an examination and had been found wanting . " I do n't know , " Gerald said as he guided the Lexus out of the clinic lot . " I do n't like him much . I liked Schwartz better . " He glanced over at Sara , her long hand curved beneath her chin , but she would n't meet his eyes . Rush hour traffic thickened around them . He should call Julian ; there was n't much point in trying to make it back to the office now . He had started to reach for the phone when Sara said , " He 's a specialist . " " You heard him : you 're in great shape . You do n't need a specialist . " " I 'd feel more comfortable with him . " Gerald shrugged . " I just did n't think he was very personable , that 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they 're personable , Gerald ? " She drummed her fingers against the dash . " Besides , Schwartz was n't especially charming . " She paused ; then , with a chill hint of emotion , she added , " Not to mention competent . " Like stepping suddenly into icy water , this - was it grief , after all these years ! Or was it anger ? He extended a hand to her , saying , " Now come on , Sara - " " Drop it , Gerald . " " Fine . " An oppressive silence filled the car . No noise from without penetrated the interior , and the concentrated purr of the engine was so muted that it seemed rather a negation of sound . A disquieting notion possessed him : perhaps there never had been sound in the world . A fractured series of images pierced him : rain-slicked barren trees , black trunks whipped to frenzy by a voiceless wind ; lane upon lane of stalled , silent cars , pouring fumes into the leaden sky ; and Sara- Sara , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroine , shaping words that could not reach him through the changeless air . Gerald shook his head . " Are you ready to go home or do you need to stop by the library ? " he asked . " Home . We need to talk about the library . " " Oh ? " " I 'm thinking of quitting , " she said . " Quitting ? " " I need some time , Gerald . We have to be careful . I do n't want to lose this baby . " " Well , sure , " he said . " But quitting . " Sara swallowed . " Besides , I think the baby should be raised at home , do n't you ? " Gerald slowed for a two-way stop , glanced into the intersection , and plunged recklessly into traffic , slotting the Lexus into a narrow space before a looming brown UPS truck . Sara uttered a brief , piercing shriek . " I had n't really thought about it , " Gerald said . And in fact he had n't  --  had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pediatricians , or car seats , or teething , or a thousand other things , all of which now pressed in upon him in an insensate rush . For the first time he thought of the baby not as a spectral possibility , but as an imminent presence , palpable , new , central to their lives . He was too old for this . But all he said was : " Quitting seems a little drastic . After all , it 's only part-time . " Sara did n't answer . " Why do n't we think about it ? " " Too late , " Sara said quietly . " You quit ? " Gerald glanced over at her , saw a wry smile touch her lips , saw in her eyes that she did n't really think it funny . " You quit ? " " Oh , Gerald , " she said . " I 'm sorry , I really am . " But he did n't know why she was apologizing , and he had a feeling that she did n't know why either . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were at a stoplight . Gerald reached for the phone . " I 've got to call Julian , " he said . THE INSTRUMENT of Gerald Hartshorn 's ascension at the advertising firm of MacGregor , MacGregor , &; Turn had been a six-foot-tall cockroach named Fenton , whom Gerald had caused to be variously flayed , decapitated , delimbed , and otherwise dispatched in a series of TV spots for a local exterminator who thereafter had surpassed even his nationally advertised competitors in a tight market . Now , a decade later , Gerald could recall with absolute clarity the moment of this singular inspiration : an early morning trip to the kitchen to get Sara a glass of grapefruit juice . That had been shortly after Sara 's first pregnancy , the abrupt , unforgettable miscarriage that for months afterward had haunted her dreams . Waking in moans or screams or a cold accusatory silence that for Gerald had been unutterably more terrible , she would weep inconsolably as he tried to comfort her , and afterward through the broken weary house they had leased in those impoverished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice cream or a cup of warm milk or , in this case , a glass of grapefruit juice . Without complaint , he had gone , flipping on lights and rubbing at his bleary eyes and lugging the heavy burden of his heart like a stone in the center of his breast . He remembered very little of those days besides the black funnel of conflicting emotion which had swept him up : a storm of anger more deleterious than any he had ever known ; a fierce blast of grief for a child he had not and could not ever know ; and , sweeping all before it , a tempest of relief still more fierce , relief that he had not lost Sara . There had been a close moment , but she at least remained for him . And , of course , he remembered the genesis of Fenton the cockroach . Remembered how , that night , as his finger brushed the switch that flooded the cramped kitchen with a pitiless glare , he had chanced to glimpse a dark anomaly flee pell-mell to safety across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on him like a gift as he watched the loathsome creature wedge its narrow body into a crevice and disappear . The Porter account , he had thought . Imagine : Fade in with thunder on a screaming housewife , her hands clasped to her face , her expression stricken . Pan recklessly about the darkened kitchen , fulgurant with lightning beyond a rain-streaked window . Jumpcut through a series of angles on a form menacing and enormous , insectoid features more hidden than revealed by the storm 's fury . Music as the tension builds . At last the armored figure of the exterminator to the rescue . Fade to red letters on a black background : Porter Exterminators . Depend On Us . But the piece had to be done straight . It could not be played for laughs . It had to be terrifying . And though the ads had gradually softened during the decade since though the cockroach had acquired a name and had been reduced to a cartoon spokesman who died comically at the end of every spot ( Please , please do n't call Porter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as Gerald had imagined it : terrifying . And effective . And that was the way Gerald thought of Fenton the giant cockroach even now . Not in his present animated incarnation , but in his original form , blackly horrifying , looming enraged from some shadowy comer , and always , always obscurely linked in his mind to the dark episode of his lost child and the wife he also had nearly lost . But despite these connections , the Porter account had remained Gerald 's single greatest success . Other accounts had been granted him ; and though Fenton was now years in the past , promotions followed . So he drove a Lexus , lived in one of the better neighborhoods , and his wife worked part-time as an aide in the children 's library not because she had to , but because she wanted to . All things considered , he should have been content . So why , when he picked up the phone to call Julian MacGregor , should the conversation which followed so dishearten him ? " I ca n't make it back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dainty Wipe thing wait until Monday ? " And Julian , his boss for twelve years , replied with just a touch of ... what ? Exasperation ? Julian said : " Do n't worry about that , I 'm going to put Lake Conley on it instead . " Lake Conley , who was a friend . Why should that bother him ? Gerald came to think of the pregnancy as a long , arduous ordeal : a military campaign , perhaps , conducted in bleak territory , beneath a bitter sky . He thought of Napoleon , bogged down in the snow outside of Moscow , and he despaired . Not that the pregnancy was without beneficial effects . In the weeks after that first visit to Dr. Exavious - at two months  --  Gerald saw Sara 's few wrinkles begin to soften , her breasts to grow fuller . But mostly the changes were less pleasant . Nausea continued to plague her , in defiance of Exavious 's predictions . They argued over names and made love with distressing infrequency . Just when Gerald grudgingly acquiesced in repainting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , neither masculine nor feminine , he was granted a momentary reprieve when Sara decided to visit her mother , two hours away . " I 'll see you tomorrow , " she told him in the flat heat promised by the August dawn . Gerald stepped close to her with sudden violent longing ; he inhaled her warm powdered odor . " Love you . " " Me too . " She flung an arm around him in a perfunctory embrace , and then the small mound of her abdomen interposed itself between them . And then she was gone . Work that day dragged through a series of ponderous crises that defied resolution , and it was with relief that Gerald looked up to see Lake Conley standing in the door . " So Sara 's out of town , " Lake said . " That 's right . " " Let 's have a drink . We should talk . " They found a quiet bar on Magnolia . There , in the cool dim , with the windows on the street like bright hot panes of molten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ junior and handsome seemingly by force of will . Lake combed his long hair with calculated informality , and his suit , half as expensive as Gerald 's , fit him with unnatural elegance . " Then Julian said , " Frankly , Sue , I do n't see the humor in this . " I swear , she nearly died . " Lake laughed . " You should have seen it , Gerald . " Gerald chuckled politely and watched as Lake took a pull at his Dos Equis . He watched him place the beer on the bar and dig with slender fingers in a basket of peanuts . Weekly sessions in the gym had shown Gerald that the other man 's slight frame was deceptive . Lake was savagely competitive in racquetball , and while it did not bother Gerald that he usually lost , it did bother him that when he won , he felt that Lake had permitted him to do so . It bothered him still more that he preferred these soulless victories to an endless series of humiliations . Often he felt bearish and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired . " Just as well I was n't there , " he said . " I 'm sure Julian would have lit into me , too . " " Julian giving you a rough time ? " Gerald shrugged . Lake gazed thoughtfully at him for a moment , then turned to the flickering television that played soundlessly over the bar . " Well , " he said with forced cheer . " Sara doing okay ? She big as a house yet ? " " Not yet . " Gerald finished his drink and signaled for another . " Thank God for gin , " he said . " There 's a good sign . " Gerald sipped at the new drink . " Been a while . We 're not drinking much at home lately . " " What 's the problem , Gerald ? " " She could have told me she stopped taking the pill . " " Sure . " " Or that she was quitting her job . " " Absolutely . " Gerald did n't say anything . A waitress backed through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blasted out of the kitchen . The sour odor of grease came to him , and then the door swung shut , and into the silence , Lake Conley said : " You 're not too happy about this . " " It 's not just that she has n't been telling me things . She 's always been a little self-contained . And she 's sorry , I know that . " " Then what is it ? " Gerald sighed . He dipped a finger in his drink and began to trace desultory patterns on the bar . " Our first baby , " he said at last . " The miscarriage . It was a close call for Sara . It was scary then and it 's even scarier now . She 's all I have . " Bitter laughter escaped him . " Her and Julian MacGregor . " " Do n't forget Fenton . " " Ah yes , the cockroach . " Gerald finished his drink , and this time the bartender had another waiting . " Is that it ? " " No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : you ever feel ... I do n't know ... weird about anything when Kaye was pregnant ? " Lake laughed . " Let me guess . You 're afraid the baby 's not yours . " And then , when Gerald shook his head , he continued , " How about this ? You 're afraid the baby is going to be retarded or horrifically deformed , some kind of freak . " " I take it you did . " Lake scooped a handful of peanuts onto the bar and began to arrange them in a neat circle . Gerald looked on in bleary fascination . Another drink had been placed before him . He tilted the glass to his lips . " It 's entirely normal , " Lake was saying . " Listen , I was so freaked out that I talked to Kaye 's obstetrician about it . You know what she said ? It 's a normal by-product of your anxiety , that 's all . That 's the first baby . Second baby ? It 's a breeze . " " That so ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best thing that 's ever happened to you . This is going to be the best experience of your life . " Gerald slouched in his stool , vastly and illogically , some fragment of his mind insisted relieved . " Another drink ? " Lake asked . Gerald nodded . The conversation strayed listlessly for a while , and then he looked up to see that daylight had faded beyond the large windows facing the street . A steady buzz of conversation filled the room . He had a sense of pressure created by many people , hovering just beyond the limits of his peripheral vision . He felt ill , and thrust half an ice-melted drink away from him . Lake 's face drifted in front of him , his voice came from far away : " Listen , Gerald , I 'm driving you home , okay ? " Opening his eyes in Lake 's car , he saw the shimmering constellation of the city beyond a breath-frosted window , cool against his cheek . Lake was saying something . What ? " You okay ? You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gerald lifted a hand weakly . Fine , fine . They were parked in the street outside Gerald 's darkened house . Black dread seized him . The house , empty , Sara away . A thin , ugly voice spoke in his mind-the voice of the . cockroach , he thought with sudden lucidity . And it said : This is how it will look when she 's gone . This is how it will look when she 's dead . She wo n't die . She wo n't die . Lake was saying , " Gerald , you have to listen to me . " Clarity gripped him . " Okay . What is it ? " A passing car chased shadow across Lake 's handsome features . " I asked you out tonight for a reason , Gerald . " " What 's that ? " Lake wrapped his fingers around the steering wheel , took in a slow breath . " Julian talked to me today . He 's giving me the Heather Drug campaign . I wanted to tell you . I told him you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gerald thought : You son of a bitch . I ought to puke in your car . But he said : " Not your fault . " He opened the door and stood up . Night air , leavened with the day 's heat , embraced him . " Later . " And then somehow up the drive to the porch , where he spent long moments fitting the key into the door . Success at last , the door swinging open . Interior darkness leaked into the night . He stumbled to the stairs , paused there to knot his tie around the newel post , which for some reason struck him as enormously funny . And then the long haul up the flight , abandoning one shoe halfway up and another on the landing , where the risers twisted to meet the gallery which opened over shining banisters into the foyer below . Cathedral ceilings , he thought . The legacy of Fenton the cockroach . And with a twist like steel in his guts , the memory of that nasty internal voice came back to him . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is how it will be when she 's dead . And then the bedroom . The sheets , and Sara 's smell upon them . The long fall into oblivion . E WOKE abruptly , clawing away a web of nightmare . He had been trapped in suffocating dark , while something - the cockroach gnawed hungrily at his guts . He sat up , breathing hard . Sara stood at the foot of the bed , his shoes dangling in her upraised hand . She said , " You son of a bitch . " Gerald squinted at the clock-radio . Dull red numbers transformed themselves as he watched . 11:03 . Sunlight lashed through the blinds . The room swam with the stink of sleep and alcohol . " Sara ... " He dug at his eyes . " You son of a bitch , " she said . She flung the shoes hard into his stomach as , gasping , he stumbled from the bed . " Sara- " But she had turned away . He glimpsed her in profile at the door , her stomach slightly domed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gerald , swallowing-how dry his throat was ! - followed . He caught her at the steps , and took her elbow . " Sara , it was only a few drinks . Lake and I - " She turned on him , a fierce light in her eyes . Her fury propelled him back a step . She reminded him of a feral dog , driving an intruder from her pups . " It 's not that , Gerald , " she said . And then - goddamn it , I wo n't be treated like that ! he stepped toward her , clasping her elbows . Wrenching her arm loose , she drew back her hand . The slap took them both by surprise ; he could see the shock of it in her eyes , softening the anger . His anger , too , dissipated , subsumed in a rising tide of grief and memory . An uneasy stillness descended . She exhaled and turned away , stared over the railing into the void below , where the sun fell in bright patches against the parquet . Gerald lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to face him , her eyes lifted to him , her hand following his to his face . He felt her touch him through the burning . " I 'm sorry , " they said simultaneously . Bright sheepish laughter at this synchronicity convulsed them , and Gerald , embracing her , saw with horror how close she stood to the stairs . Unbidden , an image possessed him : Sara , teetering on the edge of balance . In a series of strobic flashes , he saw it as it might have been . Saw her fall away from him , her arms outstretched for his grasping fingers . Saw her crash backwards to the landing , tumble down the long flight to the foyer . Saw the blood so little blood . My God , who would have thought ? So little blood ! " I 'm sorry , " he said again . She dug her fingers into his back . " It 's not that . " " Then what " She pulled away and fixed him with her stare . " Your shoes , Gerald . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stole over the tiny mound of her stomach . " I could have fallen . " " I 'm sorry , " he said , and drew her to him . Her voice tight with controlled emotion , she spoke again , barely perceptible , punctuating her words with small blows against his shoulder . " Not again , " she whispered . Clasping her even tighter , Gerald drew in a faint breath of her floralscented shampoo and gazed over her head at the stairs which fell infinitely away behind her . " Not again , " he said . Gerald watched apprehensively as Dr. Exavious dragged the ultrasound transducer over Sara 's belly , round as a small pumpkin and glistening with clear , odorless gel . The small screen flickered with a shifting pattern of gray and black , grainy and irresolute as the swirling path of a thunderstorm on a television meteorologist 's radar . Sara looked on with a clear light in her face . It was an expression Gerald saw with increasing frequency these days . A sort of tranquil beauty had come into her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes glimpsed when she moved over him in private rhythm , outward token of a concentration even then wholly private and remote . But never , never so lost to him as now . " There now , " Exavious said softly . He pointed at the screen . " There is the heart , do you see it ? " Gerald leaned forward , staring . The room , cool , faintly redolent of antiseptic , was silent but for Sara 's small coos of delight , and the muted whir of the VCR racked below the ultrasound scanner . Gerald drew a slow breath as the grayish knot Exavious had indicated drew in upon itself and expanded in a pulse of ceaseless , mindless syncopation . " Good strong heart , " Exavious said . Slowly then , he began to move the transducer again . A feeling of unreality possessed Gerald as he watched the structure of his child unfold across the screen in changeable swaths of light . Here the kidneys " Good , very good , " Exavious commented - and there the spine , knotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pausing here to trace lambent measurements on the screen with a wand , nodding to himself . And something else , which Exavious did n't comment on , but which Gerald thought to be the hint of a vestigial tail curling between the crooked lines of the legs . He had heard of children born with tails , anomalous throwbacks from the long evolutionary rise out of the jungle . Sara said , " Can you get an image of the whole baby ? " Exavious adjusted the transducer once more . The screen flickered , settled , grew still at the touch of a button . " Not the whole baby . The beam is too narrow , but this is close . " Gerald studied the image , the thing hunched upon itself in a swirl of viscous fluid , spine twisted , misshapen head fractured by atavistic features : blind pits he took for eyes , black slits for nostrils , the thin slash of the mouth , like a snake 's mouth , as lipless and implacable . He saw at the end of an out-flung limb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quell the feeling of revulsion which welled up inside him . It looked not like a child , he thought , but like some primitive reptile , a throwback to the numb , idiot fecundity of the primordial slime . He and Sara spoke at the same time : " It 's beautiful . " " My God , it does n't even look human . " He said this without thought , and only in the shocked silence that followed did he see how it must have sounded " I mean - " he said , but it was pointless . Sara would not meet his eyes . Dr. Exavious said , " In fact , you are both correct . It is beautiful indeed , but it hardly looks human . Not yet . It will , though . " He patted Sara 's hand . " Mr. Hartshorn 's reaction is not atypical . " " But not typical either , I 'm guessing . " Exavious shrugged . " Perhaps . " He touched a button and the image on the screen disappeared . He cleaned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just thinking it looks ... like something very ancient , " Gerald said . " Evolution , you know . " " Haeckel 's law . Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny . " " I 'm sorry ? " " A very old idea , Mr. Hartshorn . The development of the individual recapitulates the development of the species . " " Is that true ? " Sara asked . " Not literally . In some metaphorical sense , I suppose . " Bending , the doctor ejected the tape from the VCR and handed it to Gerald . " But let me assure you , your baby is fine . It is going to be a beautiful child . " At this , Gerald caught Sara 's eye : I 'm sorry , this look was meant to say , but she would not yield . Later though , in the car , she forgave him , saying : " Did you hear what he said , Gerald ? A beautiful child . " She laughed and squeezed his hand and said it again : " Our beautiful , beautiful baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , " he told her . But in his heart another voice was speaking , a thin ugly voice he knew . Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny , it said , and Gerald gripped the steering wheel until the flesh at his knuckles went bloodless ; he smiled at Sara , and tried to wall that voice away , and perhaps he thought he succeeded . But in the secret chambers of his heart it resonated still . And he could not help but listen . Three weeks later , Indian summer began to die away into fall , and Sara reported that the baby had begun moving within her . Time and again over the next few weeks , Gerald cupped his hand over the growing mound of her belly , alert to even the tiniest shift , but he could feel nothing , nothing at all . " There , " Sara said . Breathlessly : " Can you feel it ? " Gerald shook his head , feeling , for no reason he could quite articulate , vaguely relieved . Sara continued to put on weight , complaining gamely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gerald sometimes came upon her unawares in the bedroom , standing in her robe and gazing ruefully at the mirror , or sitting on the bed , staring thoughtfully into a closet crowded with unworn clothes and shoes that cramped her swollen feet . A thin dark line extended to her navel the rectus muscle , Exavious told them , never fear ; she claimed she could do nothing with her hair . At night , waking beside her in the darkness , Gerald found his hands stealing over her in numb bewilderment . What had happened to Sara , long known , much loved ? The clean , angular lines he had known for years vanished , her long bones hidden in this figure gently rounded and soft . Who was this strange woman sleeping in his bed ? And yet , despite all , her beauty seemed to Gerald only more pronounced . She moved easy in this new body , at home and graceful . That clear light he had glimpsed sporadically in her face gradually grew brighter , omnipresent , radiating out of her with a chill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gerald believed that old description he had so often read : Sara 's eyes indeed did sparkle . They danced , they shone with a brilliance that reflected his stare-hermetic , enigmatic , defying interpretation . Her gaze pierced through him , into a world or future he could not see or share . Her hands seemed unconsciously to be drawn to her swollen belly ; they crept over it constantly , they caressed it . Her gums swelled . She complained of heartburn , but she would not use the antacid tablets Exavious prescribed , would not touch aspirin or ibuprofen . In October , she could no longer sleep eight hours undisturbed . Once , twice , three times a night , Gerald woke to feel the mattress relinquish her weight with a long sigh . He listened as she moved through the heavy dark to the bathroom , no lights , ever considerate . He listened to the secret flow of urine , the flushing toilet 's throaty rush . He woke up , sore-eyed , yawning , and Dr. Exavious 's words  --  there are many pressures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to seem less like a joke , more like a curse . In November , they began attending the childbirth classes the doctor had recommended . Twice a week , on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , Gerald crept out of the office early , uncomfortably aware of Julian MacGregor 's baleful gaze ; at such moments , he could not help but think of Lake Conley and the Heather Drug campaign . As he retrieved the Lexus from the garage under the building and drove to the rambling old Baptist church where the classes met , his thoughts turned to his exhaustionstitched eyes and his increasingly tardy appearances at the office every morning . Uneasy snakes of anxiety coiled through his guts . One afternoon , he sneaked away half an hour early and stopped by the bar on Magnolia for two quick drinks . Calmer then , he drove to the church and parked , letting himself in through the side door of the classroom a few minutes early . Pregnant women thronged the room , luminous and beautiful and infinitely remote ; those few men like himself already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this mysterious communion . For a long terrible moment , he stood in the doorway and searched for Sara , nowhere visible . Just the room crowded with these women , their bellies stirring with a biological imperative neither he nor any man could know or comprehend , that same strange light shining in their inscrutable eyes . They are in league against us , whispered a voice unbidden in his mind . They are in league against us . Was that the cockroach 's voice ? Or was it his own ? Then the crowd shifted , Sara slipped into sight . She came toward him , smiling , and he stepped forward to meet her , this question unresolved . But the incident - and the question it inspired  --  lingered in his mind . When he woke from restless dreams , it attended him , nagging , resonant : that intimate communion of women he had seen , linked by fleshly sympathies he could not hope to understand . Their eyes shining with a passion that surpassed any passion he had known . The way they had - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if to caress the Christ , was it monstrous what came to mind ? growths within . He sat up sweating , sheets pooled in his lap . Far down in the depths of the house the furnace kicked on ; overheated air , smelling musty and dry , wafted by his face . Winter folded the house in chill intimacy , but in here ... hot , hot . His heart pounded . He wiped a hand over his forehead , dragged in a long breath . Some watchful quality to the silence , the uneven note of her respiration , told him that Sara , too , was awake . In the darkness . Thinking . She said , " You okay ? " " I do n't know , " he said . " I do n't know . " And this was sufficient for her . She asked nothing more of him than this simple admission of weakness , she never had . She touched him now , her long hand cool against his back . She drew him to the softness at her breast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a panic he could not contain rising like wind in the desert places inside him . Heavy dry sobs wracked him . " Shhh , now , " she said , not asking , just rocking him gently . Her hands moved through his hair . " Shhh , " she whispered . And slowly , by degrees imperceptible , the agony that had possessed him , she soothed away . Nothing , he thought . Of course , it had been nothing  --  anxieties , Lake Conley had said . " You okay ? " she asked again . " I 'm fine . " She pulled him closer . His hand came to her thigh , and without conscious intention , he found himself opening her gown , kissing her , her breasts , fuller now than he had ever known them . Her back arched . Her fingers were in his hair . She whispered , " Gerald , that feels nice . " He continued to kiss her , his interest rising . The room was dark , but he could see her very clearly in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supple ; this new Sara , this strange woman who shared his bed , her beauty rising out of some deep reservoir of calm and peace . He traced the slope of her breasts and belly . Here . And here . He guided her , rolling her to her side , her back to him , rump out-thrust as Exavious had recommended during a particularly awkward and unforgettable consultation " No , Gerald , " she said . She said , " No . " Gerald paused , breathing heavily . Below , in the depths of the darkened house , the furnace shut off , and into the immense silence that followed , he said , " Sara- " " No , " she said . " No , no . " Gerald rolled over on his back He tried to throttle back the frustration rising once more within him , not gone after all , not dissipated , merely ... pushed away . Sara turned to him , she came against him . He could feel the bulk of her belly interposed between them . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baby . " Her fingers were on his thigh . " It wo n't hurt the baby . Exavious said it wo n't hurt the baby . The books said it wo n't hurt the baby . Everyone says it wo n't hurt the baby . " Her voice in the darkness : " But what if it does ? I 'm afraid , Gerald . " Gerald took a deep breath . He forced himself to speak calmly . " Sara , it wo n't hurt the baby . Please . " She kissed him , her breath hot in his ear . Her fingers worked at him . She whispered , " See ? We can do something else . " Pleading now . " We can be close , I want that . " But Gerald , the anger and frustration boiling out of him in a way he did n't like , a way he could n't control - it scared him - threw back the covers . Stood , and reached for his robe , thinking : Hot . It 's too hot . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not contain himself . He paused , fingers shaking as he belted the robe , to fling back these words : " I 'm not so sure I want to be close , Sara . I 'm not at all sure what I want anymore . " And then , in three quick strides , he was out the door and into the hall , hearing the words she cried after him - " Gerald , please " - but not pausing to listen . The flagstone floor in the den , chill against his bare feet , cooled him . Standing behind the bar in the airy many-windowed room , he mixed himself a gin and-tonic with more gin than tonic and savored the almost physical sense of heat , real and emotional , draining along his tensionknotted spine , through the tight muscles of his legs and feet , into the placid stones beneath . He took a calming swallow of gin and touched the remote on the bar . The television blared to life in a far corner and he cycled through the channels as he finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room : thuggish young men entranced by the sinister beat of the city , tanks jolting over desert landscape , the gang at Cheers laughing it up at Cliff 's expense . Poor Cliff . You were n't supposed to identify with him , but Gerald could n't help it . Poor Cliff was just muddling through like anyone - Like you , whispered that nasty voice , the voice he could not help but think of as the cockroach . Gerald shuddered . On principle , he hated the remote - the worst thing ever to happen to advertising - but now he fingered it again , moved past Letterman 's arrogant smirk . He fished more ice from the freezer , splashed cleansmelling gin in his glass , chased it with tonic . Then , half-empty bottle of liquor and a jug of tonic clutched in one hand , drink and television remote in the other , Gerald crossed the room and lowered himself into the recliner . His anger had evaporated  --  quick to come , quick to go , it always had been - but an uneasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , apologize - he owed it to Sara - but he could not bring himself to move . A terrific inertia shackled him . He had no desire except to drink gin and thumb through the channels , pausing now and again when something caught his eye , half-clad dancers on MTV , a news story about the unknown cannibal killer in LA , once the tail-end of a commercial featuring none other than Fenton the giant cockroach himself . Christ . Three or four drinks thereafter he must have dozed , for he came to himself suddenly and unpleasantly when a nightmare jolted him awake . He sat up abruptly , his empty glass crashing to the floor . He had a blurred impression of it as it shattered , sending sharp scintillas of brilliance skating across the flagstones as he doubled over , sharp ghosts of pain shooting through him , as something , Christ - . - the cockroach - gnawed ravenously at his swollen guts . He gasped , head reeling with gin . The house brooded over him . Then he felt nothing , the dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lifted his clutching hands from his belly , he saw only pale skin between the loosely belted flaps of robe , not the gory mess he had irrationally expected , not the blood - so little blood , who would have thought ? So little blood and such a little No . He would n't think of that now , he would n't think of that at all . He touched the lever on the recliner , lifting his feet , and reached for the bottle of gin beside the chair . He gazed at the shattered glass and then studied the finger or two of liquor remaining in the bottle ; after a moment , he spun loose the cap and tilted the bottle to his lips . Gasoline-harsh gin flooded his mouth . Drunk now , dead drunk , he could feel it and he did n't care , Gerald stared at the television . A nature program flickered by , the camera closing on a brown grasshopper making its way through lush undergrowth . He sipped at the gin , searched densely for the remote . Must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it became too much of an effort . Hell with it . The grasshopper continued to progress in disjointed leaps , the camera tracking expertly , and this alone exerted over him a bizarre fascination . How the hell did they film these things anyway ? He had a quick amusing image : a near-sighted entomologist and his cameraman tramping through some benighted wilderness , slapping away insects and suffering the indignities of crotch-rot . Ha-ha . He touched the lever again , dropping the footrest , and placed his bare feet on the cool flagstones , mindful in a meticulously drunken way of the broken glass . Through a background of exotic bird-calls , and the swish of antediluvian vegetation , a cultured masculine voice began to speak : " Less common than in the insect world , biological mimicry , developed by predators and prey through millennia of natural selection is still ... " Gerald leaned forward , propping his elbows on his knees . A faraway voice whispered in his mind . Natural selection . Sophomore biology had been long ago , but he recognized the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exavious said ? That nasty voice whispering away ... He had a brief flash of the ultrasound video , which Sara had watched again only that evening : the fetus , reptilian , primitive , an eerie wakeful quality to its amniotic slumber . On the screen , the grasshopper took another leap . Music came up on the soundtrack , slow , minatory , almost subliminal. " ... less commonly used by predators , " the voiceover said , " biological mimicry can be dramatically effective when it is ... " The grasshopper took another leap and plummeted toward a clump of yellow and white flowers . Too fast for Gerald really to see , the flowers exploded into motion . He sat abruptly upright , his heart racing , as prehensile claws flashed out , grasped the stunned insect , and dragged it down . " Take the orchid mantis of the Malaysian rainforest , " the voiceover continued . " Evolution has disguised few predators so completely . Watch again as ... " And now the image began to replay , this time in slow motion , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow descent , the flower-colored mantis unfolding with deadly and inevitable grace from the heart of the blossom , grasping claws extended . Again . And again . Each time the camera moved in tighter , tighter , until the mantis seemed to fill the screen with an urgency dreadful and inexorable and wholly merciless . Gerald grasped the bottle of gin and sat back as the narrator continued , speaking now of aphid-farming ants and the lacewing larva . But he had ceased to listen . He tilted the bottle to his lips , thinking again of that reptilian fetus , awash in the womb of the woman he loved and did not want to lose . And now that faraway voice in his mind sounded closer , more distinct . It was the voice of the cockroach , but the words it spoke were those of Dr. Exavious . Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny . Gerald took a last pull of the bottle of gin . Now what exactly did that mean ? The ball whizzed past in a blur as Gerald stepped up to meet it , his racquet sweeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conley to catch the ricochet off the back wall , but the ball slipped past , bouncing twice , and slowed to a momentum draining roll . " Goddamn it ! " Gerald flung his racquet hard after the ball and collapsed against the back wall . He drew up his legs and draped his forearms over his knees . " Game , " Lake said . " Go to hell . " Gerald closed his eyes , tilted his head against the wall and tried to catch his breath . He could smell his own sweat , tinged with the sour odor of gin . He did n't open his eyes when Lake slid down beside him . " Kind of an excessive reaction even for you , " Lake said . " Stress . " " Work ? " " That , too . " Gerald gazed at Lake through slitted eyes . " Ahh . " They sat quietly , listening to a distant radio blare from the weightroom . From adjoining courts , the squeak of rubber-soled shoes and the intermittent smack of balls came to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him like a gray blanket , while Lake traced invisible patterns on the floor with the edge of his racquet . " Least I do n't have to worry about the Heather Drug campaign , " Gerald said . Almost immediately , he wished he could pull the words back . Unsay them . For a long time , Lake did n't answer . When he did , he said only , " You have a right to be pissed off about that . " " Not really . Long time since I put a decent campaign together . Julian knows what he 's doing . " Lake shrugged . Again , Gerald tilted his head against the wall , closing his eyes . There it was , there it always was anymore , that image swimming in his internal darkness : the baby , blind and primitive and preternaturally aware . He saw it in his dreams ; sometimes when he woke he had vague memories of a red fury clawing free of his guts . And sometimes it was n't this dream he remembered , but another : looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of Sara 's smoothly rounded belly . That one was worse . That one spoke with the voice of the cockroach . That one said : You 're going to lose her . Lake was saying , " Not to put too fine a point on it , Gerald , but you look like hell . You come to work smelling like booze half the time , I do n't know what you expect . " Expect ? What did he expect exactly ? And what would Lake say if he told him ? Instead , he said , " I 'm not sleeping much . Sara does n't sleep well . She gets up two , three times a night . " " So you 're just sucking down a few drinks so you can sleep at night , that right ? " Gerald did n't answer . " What 's up with you anyway , Gerald ? " Gerald stared into the darkness behind his closed eyes , the world around him wheeling and vertiginous . He flattened his palms against the cool wooden floor , seeking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world he had known and lost , he did not know where or how . Seeking to anchor himself to an earth that seemed to be sliding away beneath him . Seeking solace . " Gerald ? " In his mind , he saw the mantis orchid ; on the screen of his eyelids , he watched it unfold with deadly grace and drag down the hapless grasshopper . He said : " I watch the sonogram tape , you know ? I watch it at night when Sara 's sleeping . It does n't look like a baby , Lake . It does n't look like anything human at all . And I think I 'm going to lose her . I think I 'm going to lose her , it 's killing her , it 's some kind of ... something ... I do n't know ... it 's going to take her away . " " Gerald - " " No . Listen . When I first met Sara , I remember the thing I liked about her - one of the things I liked about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing I remember most was this day when I first met her family . I went home with her from school for a week-end and her whole family-her little sister , her mom , her dad-they were all waiting . They had prepared this elaborate meal and we ate in the dining room , and you knew that they were a family . It was just this quality they had , and it did n't mean they even liked each other all the time , but they were there for each other . You could feel it , you could breathe it in , like oxygen . That 's what I wanted . That 's what we have together , that 's what I 'm afraid of losing . I 'm afraid of losing her . " He was afraid to open his eyes . He could feel tears there . He was afraid to look at Lake , to share his weakness , which he had never shared with anyone but Sara . Lake said , " But do n't you see , the baby will just draw you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ever were . You 're afraid , Gerald , but it 's just normal anxiety . " " I do n't think so . " " The sonogram ? " Lake said . " Your crazy thoughts about the sonogram ? Everybody thinks that . But everything changes when the baby comes , Gerald . Everything . " " That 's what I 'm afraid of , " Gerald said . AFTER THE GYM , Gerald drove for hours without conscious purpose , trusting mindless reflexes to take him where they would . Around him sprawled the city , senseless , stunned like a patient on a table , etherized by winter . By the time he pulled the Lexus to the broken curb in a residential neighborhood that had been poor two decades past , a few flakes of snow had begun to swirl through the expanding cones of his headlights . Dusk fell out of the December sky . Gerald cracked his window , inhaled cold smoke-stained air , and gazed diagonally across the abandoned street . Still there . My God , still there after these ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had not thought of in all the long months ages , they felt like - since that first visit to Dr. Exavious : like stepping into icy water , this stepping into the past . No one lived there anymore . He could see that from the dilapidated state of the house , yard gone to seed , windows broken , paint that had been robin 's egg blue a decade ago weathered now to the dingy shade of mop water . Out front , the wind creaked a realtor 's sign long since scabbed over with rust . The skeletal swing-set remained in the barren yard , and it occurred to him now that his child - his and Sara 's child  --  might have played there if only ... If only . Always and forever if only . The sidewalk , broken and weedy , still wound lazily from the street . The concrete stoop still extruded from the front door like a grotesquely foreshortened tongue . Three stairs still mounted to the door , the railing - Dear God - shattered and dragged away years since . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Who could have known ? He thought of the gym , Lake Conley , the story he had wanted to tell but had not . He had not told anyone . And why should he ? No great trauma , there ; no abuse or hatred , no fodder for the morning talk shows ; just the subtle cruelties , the little twists of steel that made up life . But always there somehow . Never forgotten . Memories not of this house , though this house had its share God knows , but of a house very much like this one , in a neighborhood pretty much the same , in another city , in another state , a hundred years in the past or so it seemed . Another lifetime . But unforgettable all the same . Gerald had never known his father , had never seen him except in a single photograph : a merchant mariner , broad-shouldered and handsome , his wind-burned face creased by a broad incongruous smile . Gerald had been born in a different age , before such children became common , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to forget their absences and loss . His mother , he supposed , had been a good woman in her way - had tried , he knew , and now , looking back with the discerning eye of an adult , he could see how it must have been for her : the thousand slights she had endured , the cruelties visited upon a small-town girl and the bastard son she had gotten in what her innocence mistook for love . Yes . He understood her flight to the city and its anonymity ; he understood the countless lovers ; now , at last , he understood the drinking when it began in earnest , when her looks had begun to go . Now he saw what she had been seeking . Solace . Only solace . But forgive ? Now , sitting in his car across the street from the house where his first child had been miscarried , where he had almost lost forever the one woman who had thought him worthy of her love , Gerald remembered . The little twists of steel , spoken without thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had he been then ? Twelve ? Thirteen ? Old enough to know , anyway . Old enough to creep into the living room and crouch over his mother as she lay there sobbing , drunken , bruised , a cold wind blowing through the open house where the man , whoever he had been , had left the door to swing open on its hinges after he had beaten her . Old enough to scream into his mother 's whiskeyshattered face : I hate you ! I hate you ! I hate you ! Old enough to remember her reply : If it was n't for you , you little bastard , he never would have left . If it was n't for you , he never would have left me . Old enough to remember , sure . But old enough to forgive ? Not then , Gerald knew . Not now . And maybe never . THEY DID NOT GO to bed together . Sara came to him in the den , where he sat in the recliner , drinking gin and numbly watching television . He saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they never used , and beyond that , in diminishing perspective , the broad open foyer : but Sara foremost , foregrounded and unavoidable . She said , " I 'm going to bed . Are you coming ? " " I thought I 'd stay up for a bit . " She crossed the flagstone floor to him in stocking feet , soundlessly , like a grotesquely misshapen apparition - her belly preceding her . He wondered if the long lines of the body he used to know were in there somewhere . She was still beautiful , still graceful , to be sure . But she possessed now a grace and beauty unlike any he had known , ponderous and alien , wholly different from that she had possessed the first time he had seen her all those years ago - ghost-like then as well , an apparition from a world stable and dependable , a world of family , glimpsed in heart-wrenching profile through the clamorous throng of the University Center cafeteria . She knelt by him . " Please come to bed . " He swished his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to unwind . " " Gerald ... " " No really , I 'm not sleepy , okay ? " He smiled , and he could feel the falseness of the smile , but it satisfied her . She leaned toward him , her lips brushed his cheek with a pressure barely present - the merest papery rush of moth wings in a darkened room . And then she was gone . Gerald drank : stared into the television 's poison glow and drank gin and tonic , nectar and ambrosia . Tastes like a Christmas tree , Sara had told him the first night they were together , really together . He had loved her , he thought . He touched the remote , cycled past a fragmentary highlight of an NFL football game ; past the dependable hysteria over the LA cannibal killer , identity unknown ; past the long face of Mr. Ed . Drank gin and cycled through and through the channels , fragmentary windows on a broken world . Oh , he had loved her . Later , how much later he did n't know and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedroom . Without undressing , he lay supine on the bed and stared sightlessly at the ceiling , Sara beside him , sleeping the hard sleep of exhaustion for now , though Gerald knew it would not last . Before the night was out , the relentless demands of the child within her would prod her into wakefulness . Lying there , his eyes gradually adjusting to the dark until the features of the room appeared to stand out , blacker still against the blackness , something , some whim , some impulse he could not contain , compelled him to steal his hand beneath the covers : stealthy now , through the folds of the sheet ; past the hem of her gown , rucked up below her breasts ; at last flattening his palm along the arc of her distended belly . Sara took in a heavy breath , kicked at the covers restlessly , subsided . Silence all through the house , even the furnace silent in its basement lair : just Sara 's steady respiration , and Gerald with her in the weighty dark , daring hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pressure of the air . The child moved . For the first time , he felt it . He felt it move . An icy needle of emotion pierced him . It moved , moved again , the faintest shift in its embryonic slumber , bare adjustment of some internal gravity . Just a month , he thought . Only a month . The child moved , really moved now , palpable against his outstretched palm . Gerald threw back the covers , sitting upright , the room wheeling about him so swiftly that he had to swallow hard against an obstruction rising in his throat . Sara kicked in her sleep , and then was still . Gerald looked down at her , supine , one long hand curled at her chin , eyes closed , mouth parted , great mound of belly half-visible below the hem of her up-turned gown . Now again , slowly , he laid a hand against her warm stomach , and yes , just as he had feared , it happened again : the baby moved , a long slow pressure against his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice of the cockroach . But what exactly did that mean ? He moved his palm along her taut belly , pausing as Sara sighed in her sleep , and here too , like the slow pressure of some creature of the unknown deep , boiling through the placid waters , came that patient and insistent pressure . And then something more , not mere pressure , not gentle : a sudden , powerful blow . Sara moaned and arched her back , but the blow came again , as though the creature within her had hurled itself against the wall of the imprisoning womb . Why did n't she wake up ? Gerald drew his hand away . Blow was n't really the right word , was it ? What was ? His heart hammered at his ribcage ; transfixed , Gerald moved his hand back toward Sara 's belly . No longer daring to touch her , he skated his hand over the long curve on an inch-thin cushion of air . My God , he thought . My God . For he could see it now , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flesh with each repeated blow , as though a fist had punched her from within . He moved his hand , paused , and it happened again , sudden and sure , an outward protrusion that swelled and sank and swelled again . In a kind of panic - what the hell was going on here - Gerald moved his hand , paused , moved it again , tracing the curve of Sara 's belly in a series of jerks and starts . And it followed him . Even though he was no longer touching her , it followed him , that sudden outward protrusion , the thing within somehow aware of his presence and trying to get at him . The blows quickened even as he watched , until they began to appear and disappear with savage , violent speed . And still she did not wake up . Not a blow , he thought . A strike . Like the swift , certain strike of a cobra . An image unfolded with deadly urgency in Gerald 's mind : the image of the orchid-colored mantis exploding outward from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Gerald jerked his hand away as if stung . Sara 's abdomen was still and pale as a tract of mountain snow . Nothing moved there . He reached the covers across her and lay back . A terrific weight settled over him ; his chest constricted with panic ; he could barely draw breath . The terrible logic of the thing revealed itself to him at last . Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny , Exavious had told him . And what if it was true ? What if each child reflected in its own development the evolutionary history of the entire species ? Imagine : Somewhere , far far back in the evolutionary past - who could say how far ? - but somewhere , it began . A mutation that should have died , but did n't , a creature born of man and woman that survived to feed ... and reproduce . Imagine a recessive gene so rare that it appeared in only one of every ten thousand individuals - one of every hundred thousand even . For that would be sufficient , would n't it ? Gerald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be sufficient , that occasionally , three or four times in a generation , two carriers of such a gene would come together and produce ... What ? A child that was not what it appeared to be . A child that was not human . A monster clothed in human flesh . Beside him , Sara moaned in her sleep . Gerald did not move . He shut his eyes and saw against the dark screens of his eyelids , the flower-colored mantis , hidden in its perfumed lair ; saw its deadly graceful assault , its pincers as they closed around the helpless grasshopper and dragged it down . The words of the narrator came back to him as well : natural selection favors the most efficient predator . And the most efficient predator is the monster that walks unseen among its chosen prey . Terror gripped him as at last he understood how it must have been through all the long span of human history : Jack the Ripper , the Zodiac , the cannibal killer loose even now in the diseased bowels of Los Angeles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunted . He stumbled clumsily from the bed and made his way into the adjoining bathroom , where for a long time he knelt over the toilet and was violently , violently sick . Sanity returned to him in perceptual shards : watery light through the slatted blinds , the mattress rolling under him like a ship in rough waters , a jagged sob of fear and pain that pierced him through . Sara . Gerald sat upright , swallowing bile . He took in the room with a wild glance . Sara : in the doorway to the bathroom , long legs twisted beneath her , hands clutched in agony at her bloated abdomen . And blood my God , how could you have - so much blood , a crimson gout against the pale carpet , a pool spreading over the tiled floor of the bathroom . Gerald reached for the phone , dialed 911 . And then he went to her , took her in his arms , comforted her . WARMING MASSES of interns and nurses in white smocks swept her away from him at the hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting room hours spent staring at the mindless flicker of television or gazing through dirty windows that commanded a view of the parking lot , cup after cup of sour vending machine coffee clutched in hands that would not warm - Gerald could not recall how they had spirited her away . In his last clear memory he saw himself step out of the ambulance into an icy blood-washed dawn , walking fast beside the gurney , Sara 's cold hand clutched in his as the automatic doors slipped open on the chill impersonal reaches of the emergency room . Somehow he had been shunted aside , diverted without the solace of a last endearment , without even a backward glance . Instead he found himself wrestling with a severe gray-headed woman about insurance policies and admission requirements , a kind of low-wattage bureaucratic hell he hated every minute of , but missed immediately when it ended and left him to his thoughts . Occasionally he gazed at the pay phones along the far wall , knowing he should call Sara 's mother but somehow unable to gather sufficient strength to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjacent corridor , but the doctor barely broke stride . He merely cast at Gerald a speculative glance he knows , he knows - and passed on , uttering over his shoulder these words in his obscurely accented English : " We are doing everything in our power , Mr. Hartshorn . I will let you know as soon as I have news . " Alone again . Alone with bitter coffee , recriminations , the voice of the cockroach . An hour passed . At eleven o'clock , Exavious returned . " It is not good , I 'm afraid , " he said . " We need to perform a caesarean section , risky under the circumstances , but we have little choice if the baby is to survive . " " And Sara ? " " We can not know , Mr. Hartshorn . " Exavious licked his lips , met Gerald 's gaze . " Guarded optimism , shall we say . The fall ... " He lifted his hand . " Your wife is feverish , irrational . We need you to sign some forms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he fixed Gerald for a long moment with that same speculative stare and then he turned away . " I 'll be in touch . " Gerald glared at the clock as if he could by force of will speed time 's passage . At last he stood , crossed once more to the vending machines , and for the first time in seven years purchased a pack of cigarettes and a lighter . After a word with the receptionist , he stepped into the bitterly cold December morning to smoke . A few flakes of snow had begun to drift aimlessly about in the wind . Gerald stood under the E.R. awning , beneath the bruised and sullen sky , the familiar stink of cigarette smoke somehow comforting in his nostrils . He gazed out over the crowded parking lot , his eyes watering . Like stepping into icy water , he thought , this stepping into the past : for what he saw was not the endless rows of cars , but the house he had visited for the first time in a decade only a day ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voice of the hospital p.a. system nor the voice of the wind . It was the voice of the cockroach , saying words he did not want to hear . You , the cockroach told him . You are responsible . Gerald flipped his cigarette , still burning , into the gutter and wrapped his arms close about his shoulders . But the cold he felt was colder than mere weather . Responsible . He supposed he had been . Even now , he could not forget the isolation they had endured during the first years of their marriage . The fear . It had n't been easy for either of them-not for Gerald , sharing for the first time the bitter legacy of a life he had still to come to terms with ; not for Sara , smiling patrician Sara , banished from a family who would not accept the impoverished marriage she had made . To this day Gerald had not forgiven his in-laws for the wedding : the thin-lipped grimace that passed for his mother-in-law 's smile ; the encounter with his father-in-law in the spotless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dentist turned from a urinal to wag a finger in Gerald 's face . " Do n't ever ask me for a dime , Gerald , " he had said . " Sara 's made her choice and she 'll have to abide by it . " No wonder we were proud , he thought . Sara had taken an evening job as a cashier at a supermarket . Gerald continued at the ad agency , a poorly paid associate , returning nightly to the abandoned rental house where he sat blankly in front of the television and awaited the sound of Sara 's key in the lock . God knows they had n't needed a baby . But there it was . There it was . And so the pressure began to tell , the endless pressure to stretch each check just a little further . Gerald could not remember when or why money he supposed-but gradually the arguments had begun . And he had started drinking . And one night ... One night . Well . Gerald slipped another cigarette free of the pack and brought it to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set the cigarette alight , and drew deeply . One night , she was late from work and , worried , Gerald met her at the door . He stepped out onto the concrete stoop to greet her , his hand curled about the graying wooden rail . When Sara looked up at him , her features taut with worry in the jaundiced corona of the porch light , he had just for a moment glimpsed a vision of himself as she must have seen him : bearish , slovenly , stinking of drink . And poor . Just another poor fucking bastard , only she had married this one . He opened his arms to her , needing her to deny the truth he had seen reflected in her eyes . But she fended him off , a tight-lipped little moue of distaste crossing her features - he knew that expression , he had seen it on her mother 's face . Her voice was weary when she spoke . Her words stung him like a lash . " Drinking again , Gerald ? " And then , as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes I think Mom was right about you . " And he had struck her . For the first and only time in all the years they had been married , he had struck her - without thought or even heat , the impulse arising out of some deep poisoned well-spring of his being , regretted even as he lifted his hand . Sara stumbled . Gerald moved forward to steady her , his heart racing . She fell away from him forever , and in that timeless interval Gerald had a grotesquely heightened sense of his surroundings : the walk , broken and weedy ; the dim shadow of a moth battering himself tirelessly against the porch light ; in the sky a thousand thousand stars . Abruptly , the world shifted into motion again ; in confusion , Gerald watched an almost comically broad expression of relief spread over Sara 's face . The railing . The railing had caught her . " Jesus , Sara , I 'm sort - " he began to say , but a wild gale of hilarity had risen up inside her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this simple action , Gerald saw . She did not yet see that with a single blow he had altered forever the tenor of their relationship . But the laughter was catching , and he stepped down now , laughing himself , laughing hysterically in a way that was not funny , to soothe away her fears before she saw the damage he had done . Maybe she would never see it . But just at that moment , the railing snapped with a sound like a gunshot . Sara fell hard , three steps to the ground , breath exploding from her lungs . But again , she was okay . Just shaken up . Only later , in the night , would Gerald realize what he had done . Only when the contractions took her would he begin to fear . Only when he tore back the blankets of the bed and saw the blood so little blood would he understand . Gerald snapped away his cigarette in disgust . They had lost the child . Sara , too , had almost died . And yet she had forgiven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked back through the cold-fogged windows at the waiting room , but he could n't tolerate the idea of another moment in there . He turned back to the parking lot , exhaled into his cupped hands . He thought of Dr. Exavious , those febrile eyes , the way he had of seeming to gaze into the secret regions of your heart . Probing you . Judging you . Finding you wanting . There was something else . Last night . With this thought , Gerald experienced bleak depths of self-knowledge he had never plumbed before . He saw again the smooth expanse of his wife 's belly as he had seen it last night , hideously aswarm with the vicious assaults of the creature within . Now he recognized this vision as a fevered hallucination , nothing more . But last night , last night he had believed . And after his feverish dream , after he had been sick , he had done something else , had n't he ? Something so monstrous and so simple that until this moment he had successfully avoided thinking of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the doorway between the bedroom and the bathroom , he had kicked off his shoes , deliberately arranging them heel up on the floor . Knowing she would wake to go to the john two , maybe three times in the night . Knowing she would not turn on the light . Knowing she might fall . Hoping . You are responsible . Oh yes , he thought , you are responsible , my friend . You are guilty . Just at that moment , Gerald felt a hand on his shoulder . Startled , he turned too fast , feeling the horror rise into his face and announce his guilt to anyone who cared to see . Exavious stood behind him . " Mr. Hartshorn , " he said . Gerald followed the doctor through the waiting room and down a crowded corridor that smelled of ammonia . Exavious did not speak ; his lips pressed into a narrow line beneath his mustache . He led Gerald through a set of swinging doors into a cavernous chamber lined with pallets of supplies and soiled linen heaped in laundry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glow over the concrete floor . " What 's going on ? " Gerald asked . " How 's Sara ? " Exavious did not reply . He stopped by a broad door of corrugated metal that opened on a loading dock , and thumbed the button of the freight elevator . " One moment , please , Mr. Hartshorn , " he said . They waited silently as the doors slid aside . Exavious gestured Gerald in , and pressed the button for six . With a metallic clunk of gears , they lurched into motion . Gerald stared impassively at the numbers over the door , trying to conceal the panic that had begun to hammer against his ribs . The noisy progress of the elevator seemed almost to speak to him ; if he listened closely , he could hear the voice of the cockroach , half-hidden in the rattle of machinery : She 's dead , Gerald . She 's dead and you 're responsible . Exavious knew . Gerald could see that clearly now . He was n't even surprised when Exavious reached out and stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physically sickened by a sour twist of nausea that doubled him over as the elevator ground to a halt with a screech of overtaxed metal . Gerald sagged against the wall as a wave of vertigo passed through him . Sara . Lost . Irrevocably lost . He swallowed hard against the metallic taste in his mouth and closed his eyes . They hung suspended in the shaft , in the center of an enormous void that seemed to pour in at Gerald 's eyes and ears , at every aperture of his body . He drew it in with his breath , he was drowning in it . Exavious said : " This conversation never occurred , Mr. Hartshorn . I will deny it if you say it did . " Gerald said nothing . He opened his eyes , but he could see only the dull sheen of the elevator car 's walls , scarred here and there by careless employees . Only the walls , like the walls of a prison . He saw now that he would not ever really leave this prison he had made for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had destroyed his dignity , his self-respect , his honor and his love . And Sara . Sara most of all . Exavious said : " I have spoken with Dr. Schwartz . I should have done so sooner . " He licked his lips . " When I examined your wife I found no evidence to suggest that she could not carry a child to term . Even late-term miscarriages are not uncommon in first pregnancies . I saw no reason to delve into her history . " He said all this without looking at Gerald . He did not raise his voice or otherwise modify his tone . He stared forward with utter concentration , his eyes like hard pebbles . " I should have seen the signs . They were present even in your first office visit . I was looking at your wife , Mr. Hartshorn . I should have been looking at you . " Gerald 's voice cracked when he spoke . " Schwartz-what did Schwartz say ? " " Dr. Schwartz was hesitant to say anything at all . He is quite generous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt . When pressed , however , he admitted that there had been evidence - a bruise on your wife 's face , certain statements she made under anesthesia - that the miscarriage had resulted from an altercation , a physical blow . But you both seemed very sorrowful , so he did not pursue the matter . " Exavious turned to look at Gerald , turned on him the terrific illumination of his gaze , his darkly refulgent eyes exposing everything that Gerald had sought so long to hide . " A woman in your wife 's superb physical condition does not often have two late-term miscarriages , Mr. Hartshorn . Yet Mrs. Hartshorn claims that her fall was accidental , that she tripped over a pair of shoes . Needless to say , I do not believe her , though I am powerless to act on my belief . But I had to speak , Mr. Hartshorn - not for you , but for myself . " He punched a button . The elevator jerked into motion once more . " You are a very lucky man , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is recovering from the epidural . " He turned once more and fixed Gerald in his gaze . " The baby survived . A boy . You are the father of a healthy baby boy . " The elevator stopped and the doors opened onto a busy floor . " It is more than you deserve . " SARA , THEN . Sara at last , flat on her back in a private room on the sixth floor . At the sight of her through the wire-reinforced window in the door , Gerald felt a bottomless relief well up within him . He brushed past Dr. Exavious without speaking . The door opened so silently on its oiled hinges that she did not hear him enter . For a long moment , he stood there in the doorway , just looking at her- allowing the simple vision of her beauty and her joy to flow through him , to fill up the void that had opened in his heart . He moved forward , his step a whisper against the tile . Sara turned to look at him . She smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then nodded , her eyes returning to her breast and the child that nursed there , wizened and red and patiently sucking . Just a baby . A child like any other . But different , Gerald knew , different and special in no way he could ever explain , for this child was his own . A feeling like none he had ever experienced - an outpouring of warmth and affection so strong that it was almost frightening - swept over him as he came to the bedside . Everything Lake Conley had told him was true . What happened next happened so quickly that Gerald for a moment believed it to be an hallucination . The baby , not yet twelve hours old , pulled away from Sara 's breast , pulled away and turned , turned to look at him . For a single terrifying moment Gerald glimpsed not the wrinkled child he had beheld when first he entered the room , but .. something else . Something quicksilver and deadly , rippling with the sleek , purposeful musculature of a predator . A fleeting impression of oily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glared narrow-pupiled eyes ashine with chill intelligence . Eyes like a snake 's eyes , as implacable and smugly knowing . Mocking me , Gerald thought . Showing itself not because it has to , but because it wants to . Because it can . And then his old friend the cockroach : Your child . Yours . Gerald extended his hands to Sara . " Can It " he asked . And then he drew it to his breast , blood of his blood , flesh of his flesh , this creature that was undeniably and irrevocably his own child .
