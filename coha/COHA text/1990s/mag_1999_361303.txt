In any other week , the disclaimer on the door of Inkubus Haberdashery , a Gothic fashion store in Miami 's Coconut Grove district , would have seemed as out of place as the boutique itself . THE GOTHIC COMMUNITY IN NO WAY CONDONES THE USE OF VIOLENCE , it read . WE ARE APPALLED BY THE KILLINGS AND BY THE INFERENCE THAT THE MURDERERS BELONGED TO OUR CULTURE . Inside , owner Malaise Graves lamented the spotlight the Littleton killings had suddenly thrown on Goth culture . " I 'm afraid this violent stereotyping of us is only going to get worse now , " she sighed . <P> The initial assumption that Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold were Goths  --  simply because they wore black trench coats , painted their fingernails black and listened to Marilyn Manson music  --  got real Goths everywhere hot under the black leather collar .
