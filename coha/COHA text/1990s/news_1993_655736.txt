<p> SEVERAL attacks on foreigners throughout Germany every day ; demonstrations and riots against immigrants ; arson and murder directed by neo-Nazi Germans against foreigners , the disabled , and gays ; the rapid rise of right-wing political parties and increasing disgust with the politics of democratic compromise and tolerance . <p> In Germany , the word " Politikverdrossenheit " ( disgust with politics ) has become the editorial catchword to capture the dark and bitter mood that prevails throughout the country . Its most recent manifestation came in elections Sunday in the German state of Essen , where the extreme right Republican Party won 8.3 percent of the vote , up from less than 1 percent four years ago . <p> Events in Germany are at least partially the result of two fundamental mistakes made by Chancellor Helmut Kohl three years ago , one economic , the other political . Both are closely connected . <p> Chancellor Kohl 's economic mistake was that he failed to see the tremendous challenge posed by the collapse of the East German economy . During the 1990 election campaign in Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new " economic miracle " was imminent in East Germany ( GDR ) ; ( 2 ) that no one would be worse off because of unification , but many people would be better off ; and ( 3 ) that because of unification 's economic dynamism , the entire process could be financed without raising taxes . <p> Kohl was wrong on all three counts . A few simple figures may suffice to suggest how wrong . As of 1992 , industrial production in the former GDR had sunk to 30 percent of its previous level , and would have sunk to 15 percent had it not been for emergency measures taken by the federal government . The official unemployment figures for the former GDR are now hovering around 15 percent , but that figure is artificially low , kept down by forced retirements , job-creation measures , and shortened work weeks . The real figure is probably at least twice as high , and will continue to rise for at least another year . <p> During the second half of 1991 alone , the East German gross domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 18.7 percent . Meanwhile , prices went up 21.4 percent . The average East German makes about half as much as the average West German . <p> In order to finance reunification , the federal government has engaged in a positively American bout of deficit spending , driving interest rates to record highs . And on top of it all , the West German economy , pumped up in 1990 by pent-up consumer demand from the East , is now in deep recession , just as the United States seems to be coming out of one . <p> These outcomes all were predicted and expected . The collapse of the wall was an economic as well as a political event , since the wall was the only thing that kept the East German economy from imploding during the last three decades . Suddenly , with economic unification , East German companies had to compete with immensely more sophisticated West German competitors . Is it any wonder that so many of them went bankrupt ? In 1990 Kohl refused to listen to the voices of economic common sense - including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - who urged a more cautious approach , tax increases , and more protection for the East German economy . He has only himself to blame if he refused to listen . <p> Americans can perhaps get a sense of the magnitude , if not the precise contours , of what is happening if they imagine what might occur if President Clinton were to announce suddenly that Mexico was about to become the 51st state . <p> There is an irony of history in all this . On Nov. 9 , 1989 , when the wall fell , East German masses danced in the streets and went on a buying spree in West Berlin . They naively believed that West German prosperity was now around the corner . But it was not prosperity , it was economic depression , that was around the corner . Sometimes political freedom does not go hand in hand with immediate prosperity . <p> Unfortunately , Kohl did nothing to disabuse East Germans of their economic illusions and a great deal to delude them even further . It now looks as if large numbers of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well , equated the concepts " democracy " and " national unity " with the concept " economic prosperity . " That is a dangerous confusion ; when economic prosperity did not immediately materialize , the concepts of democracy and national unity also came into question . <p> It is very sad , but not surprising , that Germany is experiencing outbursts of right-wing and neo-Nazi violence . This too was predicted and expected . Germany 's most famous writer , Gunter Grass , warned in the summer of 1990 that the East German economy was in the process of collapse , and that " the only place where we might expect growth is where our own fears and the fears of our neighbors got their start : in German right-wing radicalism . " <p> It now looks as if , in both parts of Germany , democracy and " Wirtschaftswunder " are genuinely confused . This is what German sociologist Jurgen Habermas was getting at when he warned in 1990 of the possibility that a " D-Mark Nationalism " might smother democratic consciousness , possibly threatening democratic gains made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might conclude that Germany is only persuaded to support democracy when it is rich and prosperous , but that the democratic veneer collapses under economic pressure . Such a conclusion is wrong , but it could be a dangerously tempting one to draw , especially for the masses in East Germany , most of whom had no experience either with democracy or with capitalism . <p> Kohl 's second mistake was political . As the leader of his nation , he had the chance in 1989 and 1990 to initiate a broad discussion about the concept of democracy , to make it clear that politics and economics , while interrelated and interconnected , are two separate spheres - perhaps even to suggest that freedom is even more important and more valuable than prosperity . <p> Such a discussion was absolutely vital , since at least one-fourth of the population had no concept of what democracy was . But a democracy is only as effective as the people 's willingness to create it and make it work . 1990 should have been the year for a broad-based constitutional discussion inside Germany . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> None of this means that reunification was wrong . There was no realistic political , moral , or economic alternative . But Kohl 's way of pursuing it revealed either a dismal ignorance of the real situation in East Germany or a Machiavellian wish to ignore it . Given this record , it is difficult to see how Kohl has anything to offer the Germany that he helped unify , only to leave it in the lurch . It looks very much as if his days as chancellor are numbered .
