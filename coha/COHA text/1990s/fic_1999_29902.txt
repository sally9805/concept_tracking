St. Cyre Town House London , 1811 March 25th Grayson Albemarle St. Cyre , Baron Cliffe , read the single page one more time , then slowly crumpled it in his hand . Some letter , he thought , as he threw the ball of paper into the fireplace . Not many words on the page , but most of the few there were vicious and malevolent . He . watched the paper slowly crinkle around the edges , then burst into bright flame . He walked out of the drawing room and down the long corridor toward the back of his home . He opened the door to the libraryhis roomall somber and warm and filled with books and little else . The heavy , dark gold velvet draperies were drawn tightly against the night , the fire low and sluggish because none of the servants had known he would be coming into this room at this time . They all thought he 'd left five minutes before to visit his mistress . He thought of the damned letter and cursed , but not as fluently as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely walk . He sat down at his desk and took a piece of foolscap from the top drawer , dipped the quill into the ink pot , and wrote : If I receive another threat from you , I will treat you as you deserve . I will beat you senseless and leave you in a ditch to die . He signed his initials , GSC , slowly folded the paper , and slid it into an envelope . He walked to theelegant Spanish table that sat against the wall in the entrance hall and placed the envelope onto the ancient silver salver that his butler , Quincy , cleaned every other day , at one o'clock in the afternoon , without fail . He wondered as he walked in the cold , clear , early spring night to the apartment of his sweet Jenny what would happen now . Probably nothing . Men of Clyde Barrister 's stamp were cowards . Carlisle Manor Near Folkstone . March 29th There was nothing more to say , damn her . He was panting with rage at her , the ungrateful little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand to strike her , then got hold of himself . " If I hit you , Carlton will know it and perhaps not want you . " She whimpered , her head down , her hair straggling long and tangled and sweaty down the sides of her face . " Silent at last , are you ? I never thought I 'd see you mute as a tree . It 's refreshing for once not having to listen to your complaints and see those looks of yours . Silence and submissiveness are very charming in women , in you especially , though I 'm just now seeing them for the first time . Well , perhaps it 's over , eh ? Yes , you 've finally given up . You wo n't go against me anymore . " She said not a word . When he grabbed her chin in his hand and forced her head up , there were tears in her eyes . But still he frowned . He stared down at her hard , still breathing hoarsely from his pacing and yelling . But his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute before , and his voice no longer trembled with rage when he spoke . " You will marry Sir Carlton Avery . He will return tomorrow morning . You will smile shyly at him and tell him that it is your honor to become his wife . I have given him my blessing . The marriage settlements are agreed upon . Everything is done . You will not disobey me , or when I next see you , I will make you very sorry . " He grabbed her chin again , saw the tear streaking down her cheeks , and smiled . " Good , " he said . " Tonight you will bathe and wash your hair . You look like a slut from Drury Lane . " He swiftly left her bedchamber , humming with his victory . Still , because he did n't want her to forget that he was serious , he slammed the door behind him . She heard his key grate in the lock . She heard his heavy-booted footsteps receding down the long corridor . She drew in a deep breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , God . Thank you , God . " He 'd forgotten to retie her hands . She lifted her hands , looked at the ugly , raw bruises on her wrists , and began to rub feeling back into them . She bent over to untie her ankles , then rose slowly from the chair where she 'd been trussed up like a criminal for three days . She relieved herself and quickly downed two glasses of water from the carafe that sat on her bedside table . Her breathing calmed . She was very hungry . He had n't allowed her any food since the previous evening . But he 'd forgotten and left her hands untied . Perhaps he had n't forgotten . Perhaps he believed he 'd finally broken her and tying her hands did n't matter . Well , she 'd tried to make him believe that . To hold her tongue had cost her dearly . To squeeze tears out of her eyes had n't proved so difficult . Would he come back ? That got her into action more quickly than having Farmer Mason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have . She had to leave in the next three minutes , perhaps sooner . She 'd thought of this so often during the long hours of the past three days , had meticulously planned it , modified her plans , pictured everything she would be able to carry in the small , light valise . The next two minutes she spent tying the ends of her two sheets together , slinging them out of the second-floor window , and praying that she would fit through the tall , narrow opening . No doubt she was thinner now than she had been three days ago . She 'd stared at that window off and on during the past three days , knowing it was her only way out . She would have to squeeze through it . She had no choice at all . She managed , barely . When she was dangling six feet above the ground , she looked briefly back up at her bed-chamber window , then smiled . She let go and rolled when she landed on the soft , sloping ground . When she stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a few bruises from her jump , she looked back at her home once more , its lines soft and mellow beneath the brilliant light of the half-moon . A lovely property , Carlisle Manor , one that had belonged to her father , Thomas Levering Bascombe , not this bastard , not this man who 'd married her mother after her father had died . And now Carlisle Manor was his , all his , and there was nothing anyone could do about it . With luck she would n't be missed until the morning . Unless he remembered and came back to tie her hands . Then things would be a bit more difficult . At least Georgie was far away from here , all the way up at York , and thus would be safe from their stepfather 's rage when he discovered that his pigeon had escaped the cage . His pigeon also knew where to go .
