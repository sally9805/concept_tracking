WE ARE CONFRONTING AN EPISODE of species extinction greater than anything the world has experienced for the past 65 million years . Of all the global problems that confront us , this is the one that is moving the most rapidly and the one that will have the most serious consequences . Unlike other global ecological problems , these extinctions  --  and the loss of our biodiversity  --  are completely irreversible . THE IMPACT OF HUMANITY The earth , our planetary home , is truly finite . Economic formulas , developed over the past 200 years to keep track of the values involved in human transactions , can not make the planet any larger . Nor can they give us any more of the productive systems and commodities on which we depend . No matter how clever we may be , the earth remains the same . We can use it and its systems sustainably , or we will destroy them . Our species first appeared about 500,000 years ago , at the very last instant of the planet 's 4.5-billion-year history . As our hunter-gatherer ancestors began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also began to exterminate many of the large animals and birds that they killed for food . When agriculture was invented independently in eastern Asia , the eastern Mediterranean , Mexico , and Peru some 8,000 to 11,000 years ago , there were perhaps as few as 5 million people throughout the world . But this population then began to grow quickly , and the extensive land clearing and grazing that characterized early agriculture caused rapidly increasing extinctions . The number of people grew steadily to an estimated 130 million by 2,000 years ago , to 500 million by A.D. 1650 , to 2.5 billion by 1950 , and to a rapidly growing 5.7 billion today . Over the last 40 years , humanity has wrought a great deal of damage to the earth , including : * Wasting about a fifth of the world 's topsoil . * Losing about an eighth of our cultivated lands to desertification , waterlogging , and salinization. * Increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by over a third , setting the world on an inexorable course to warmer climates. * Destroying more than 5% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converting to simplified biological deserts  --  about a third of the forests that existed in 1950 . Human beings  --  just one of about 10 million species on the planet  --  are currently estimated to be consuming , wasting , or diverting 40% of the net photosynthetic production on land . We are using an estimated third of the planet 's available fresh water . And yet our numbers are not likely to stabilize until they have reached two or three times their present level , even with continued worldwide attention to family planning , because there is such a high proportion of young people in developing countries . Our impact on forests and other biologically rich communities is already so intense around the world that we are losing plant and animal species at between 1,000 and 10,000 times the natural rate that occurred before our ancestors first appeared on earth . Judged from the fossil record , the average life-span of a species is about 4 million years . So , if there are about 10 million species in the world , the normal rate of extinction can be calculated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this historical level , and at a moderate estimate , we are now likely to lose around 50,000 species a year over the next few decades . The rate will presumably accelerate as the years go by . Biodiversity expert Edward O. Wilson has pointed out , " Clearly we are in the midst of one of the great extinction spasms of geological history . " If we lose two-thirds of all living species over the course of the next century , this will be more or less equivalent to the proportion that disappeared at the end of the Cretaceous Period , 65 million years ago  --  one of several great extinctions in Earth 's history . It took more than 5 million years for the world to regain equilibrium after that . This is a sobering period of time to contemplate , because it is more than five times as long as the history of our own species . BIODIVERSITY AS A PRIORITY Why does biodiversity matter ? There are three classes of reason for concern . The first is ethical and aesthetic . As Wilson and population expert Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the dominant species on Earth , we and many others think that people have an absolute moral responsibility to protect what are our only known living companions in the universe . Human responsibility in this respect is deep , beyond measure , beyond conventional science for the moment , but urgent nonetheless . " The second class of reason is economic . We use organisms for food , medicines , chemicals , fiber , clothing , structural materials , energy , and many other purposes . Only about 100 kinds of plants provide the great majority of the world 's food . They are precious , and their genetic diversity should be preserved and enhanced . There are also tens of thousands of other plants , especially in the tropics , that have edible parts and might be used more extensively for food if we knew them better . But overconcentration on the 20 or so best-known food plants tends to lead us to neglect the others . Plants and other organisms are natural biochemical factories . More than 60% of the world 's people depend directly on plants for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 5,000 of the estimated 30,000 species of plants in their country for medicinal purposes . Moreover , the great majority of Western medicines owe their existence to research on the natural products that organisms produce . For example , natural products played a role in the derivation of each of the top 20 pharmaceutical products sold in the United States in 1988 . Relatively few of the 250,000 known kinds of plants in the world have been fully examined , so it stands to reason that the remaining species may contain unknown compounds of probable therapeutical importance . " I still maintain that no chemist can dream up the complex bioactive molecules produced by nature . But once the natural lead compounds have been discovered , then the chemists can proceed with synthetic modifications to improve on the natural lead , " says Gordon Cragg , chief of the Natural Products Branch of the National Cancer Institute . For example , artemesin is the only drug effective against all of the strains of the Plasmodium organisms that cause malaria , which afflicts 250 million people a year . Its chemical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have been used against the disease over the past two centuries . Neither its existence nor its effectiveness could have been predicted had the Chinese not traditionally been using an extract of natural wormwood , Artemisia annua , to treat malaria . Taxol , the only drug that shows promise against breast and ovarian cancer , was initially found in the western yew by a U.S. government program randomly screening plants for anti-cancer activities . Its molecule is structurally unique , and there is no way it could have been visualized had it not been discovered in nature . A novel compound from the African vine Ancistrocladus korupensis , Michellamine B , shows a remarkable range of anti-HIV activity . It does not work in the same way as AZT and other anti-HIV drugs . When its method of action is understood , it may well assist in the discovery of other drugs that will be effective against AIDS . Against this background , it is easy to understand why the major pharmaceutical firms are expanding their programs of exploration for new , naturally occurring molecules with useful properties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nations have not already united in a major effort to explore and conserve the biodiversity on which so much of our common future will so clearly depend . The third class of reason for being concerned about the loss of biodiversity centers on the array of essential services provided by natural ecosystems , such as : * Protecting watersheds . * Regulating local climates. * Maintaining atmospheric quality . * Absorbing pollution . * Generating and maintaining soils . Ecosystems , functioning properly , are responsible for the earth 's ability to capture energy from the sun and transform it into chemical bonds to provide the energy necessary for the life processes of all species , including ourselves . MODELS FOR PRESERVING BIODIVERSITY Clearly , much of the quality of ecosystem services will be lost if the present episode of extinction is allowed to run unbridled for much longer . And the rebuilding of these systems , in which our descendants will be engaged , is likely to be seriously impaired by our neglect . The preservation of biodiversity can only be accomplished as part of an overall strategy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world is to attain a stable human population . But this will not in itself allow the attainment of a stable world . For this , the problems of poverty and social justice must be addressed much more effectively throughout the world . More than four-fifths of the world 's resources are consumed by the rapidly shrinking fraction of the global population ( now less than a quarter of the total ) that lives in industrialized countries . This overconsumption must be brought under control . If the problems of population and poverty in the developing world ( and overconsumption in industrialized nations ) could be addressed adequately , there are a number of strategies that could be employed for managing biodiversity , such as conserving a reasonable sample of the species that exist today . For instance , a worldwide system of protected areas ought to be established and maintained , based perhaps on the UNESCO Biosphere Reserve and the Man and the Biosphere Reserve programs . Areas should be selected systematically in order to include the greatest possible proportion of the existing global biodiversity . These protected areas must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account modified and partly natural ecosystems , as well as human interaction of all kinds . It will clearly not be possible to protect all of the world 's biodiversity by preserving samples of pristine ecosystems permanently in their original condition . This will happen only with the full participation of the peoples of developing countries , and assisted strongly by the industrialized world , which must provide the bulk of the financial resources . The Global Environment Facility , an interim financial mechanism adopted by the Convention on Biological Diversity , offers a model of how the funding for such programs might be organized . See " Biodiversity Projects around the World " for further details . Mechanisms must be established for preserving samples of selected organisms outside these natural areas . Plants are one likely target . Botanical gardens should be encouraged to form a worldwide operational network to conserve plants , and a network of seed banks should also be formed . Other economically important groups of organisms , such as bacteria and fungi , lend themselves to preservation . Developing countries contain at least four-fifths of global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population  --  but are home to only about 6% of the world 's scientists and engineers . Developing strong scientific communities in these countries is critical . Their scientific infrastructure must be strengthened as rapidly as possible by providing funds for adequate library resources , computer facilities , inexpensive and rapid communication , and by encouraging collaboration between scientists from countries with adjacent biomes . One of the best strategies for strengthening the relative capabilities in developing countries is the development of national schemes for the management ( including the preservation ) of biodiversity . The Instituto Nacional de Biodiversidad in Costa Rica provides one attractive model . National biological inventories are effective tools for national development and can assist greatly in building national capabilities to deal with biological diversity . All nations should have access to the relevant biotechnology . Its intelligent use  --  helping to make possible the incorporation of biodiversity into everyday living and thus the stimulation of economic growth  --  leads directly to reduced pressures on natural ecosystems . Young scientists in the developing world should be encouraged to master the principles of biotechnology and to apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientists could use hundreds of additional tropical species appropriately at a commercial level . In addition , the knowledge possessed by indigenous and other rural peoples must be viewed as a precious and rapidly vanishing field of information  --  one we must learn about while there is still time . Steps ought to be taken , for both scientific and economic reasons , to try to sample the diversity that exists now , because the next few decades can only be a time of catastrophic extinction . In many ways , we now have an opportunity comparable to that of living in the final decades of the Cretaceous Period 65 million years ago . We have opportunities to sample the full range of biodiversity with which we coexist  --  opportunities that may never occur again .
