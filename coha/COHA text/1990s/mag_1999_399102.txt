Section : Secrets of My Success Frustrated that her weight made her look old , but not interested in " working out , " Kay Black decided to get active-at home <p> " Grandma . " The word still rings in my ears . Oh sure , it may sound sweet to someone who actually has grandchildren , but I was only 54 , and my youngest child was still in high school . <p> Grandma . Who 'd have thought that one little word uttered so innocently would start a domino effect that would change my life ? That word alone drove me to the mirror where I took a long , hard look at myself . Although my hair was turning gray , I knew that my figure was the true culprit . From armpits to hips , I was an unbroken line . <p> Looking in the mirror led me to look at my life . A mother of two , I 'd always been active . Still , since I stopped dancing more than a dozen years ago , I had n't made regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd added 40 pounds to my 5 ' 5 " frame . Now my life was teaching , shuttling my daughter to riding classes , cooking , and keeping house . I was always doing things but never exercising . <p> So I decided to make some changes . Exercise is n't about going to the gym and jumping around in a pink leotard , I reasoned ; it 's about activity-and I had lots to do . Who Needs a Gym ? <p> So one January evening last year , I began my " exercise " regime . I had decided to catalog my 5,000-plus books in our new computer . That meant carrying them upstairs . Each evening , I 'd make more than half a dozen trips up and down the stairs with an armful of books , and each morning , after entering the data , back down . In less than a month , I saw the scale slip from 168 pounds to 162 . <p> I could n't believe it ! If just a few trips up the stairs could have that effect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real effort . Because my next winter project was a sedentary one-embroidering a tablecloth-I decided to add a physically demanding one : cleaning out the attic . I also started walking our new puppy every morning . <p> At first , I was huffing and puffing to make it around our block , which is less than half a mile . Still , I kept it up . The dog had to be walked , the attic had to be cleaned , and I was exercising to boot . It was a two-for-one deal . <p> I found that I could also squeeze extra activity into my day by using time wisely . While my daughter was riding , I started taking a short walk instead of waiting in the car . That walk , which began as a 20-minute , 1-mile stroll in March , grew to a brisk 30-minute , 2-mile walk by June . At night while I watched TV , I started doing half an hour of stretching and floor exercises . Calories Count <p> My activity level was n't the only thing I altered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating habits . <p> I was shocked to see how much I consumed . Typically , I 'd skip breakfast and grab a hoagie for lunch . If I got hungry later , I 'd have tea with milk and sugar or swing by the bakery for a cruller or fresh-baked bread . Then there was the killer : dinner . Most evenings , my daughter did n't finish riding until close to 8:00 pm . Famished , we 'd head to the nearest diner for steak and fries slathered in gravy . <p> Those were habits I knew I had to break . I decided to start eating breakfast and adding minimeals to avoid hunger . Although I started reading labels and counting calories , I did n't force myself to eat the same thing every day . Breakfast might be a bagel or a fat-free waffle with a little apple butter ; lunch might be a low-fat frozen meal or a shrimp and broccoli stir-fry . Dinner , which moved up to 5:00 pm , was chicken , fish , or lean red meat with lots of veggies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit , or crackers . By snacking on only low-calorie foods and distracting myself with chores , I was able to maintain a 1,200-calorie-a-day diet without feeling hungry . Success Breeds Success <p> The results were so encouraging that it was n't hard to stay motivated . By April , I had to buy new size-12 jeans , because my 14s were baggy . Even better , my energy and endurance had soared . <p> As my morning walks lengthened , I left the puppy at home ( he slowed me down ) . By March , I was walking 2 miles to the park and back . After another month , I added a 1-mile loop around the lake , and after 2 months , I began exploring neighborhoods . By July , I was up to 5 miles a day . I still love those walks . They 're my private time when I can collect my thoughts and prepare for the day . <p> In September , I celebrated a victory : I 'd lost 55 pounds in time for my 55th birthday . It was the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weight off since then and even lost a few more pounds . Today , I weigh 110 , a weight I maintain comfortably , and wear a size 6 . And although I still watch what I eat , I 've upped my daily intake to about 1,400 calories . <p> Now that my daughter drives herself to her riding lessons , I 've eliminated my afternoon walk . But I have n't slowed down . When the weather is nice , my garden is my gym . Hauling mulch and manure and tilling the soil are great exercise . When it 's nasty , there are always closets to be cleaned , an attic to be tidied , and bathrooms to paint . <p> Every time I tackle one of these little projects , I think about what I 'll be doing : the lifting , the stretching , the climbing . " Oh , good , " I think . " Another workout ! " Six Calorie-Burning Chores <p> Fixing up the house may solve your exercise fix too .
