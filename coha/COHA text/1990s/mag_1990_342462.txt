When Americans sit down to their Thanksgiving turkey this week , some uninvited guests could turn a nice meal into a miserable occasion . If the big bird is not thoroughly cooked , it could pass on bacteria that cause fever , stomach cramps , vomiting , diarrhea  --  all the classic symptoms of food poisoning . Often the culprit is salmonella , a nasty microbe that , despite industry and government inspections , lurks in perhaps 35% of all poultry sold in the U.S. <P> Salmonella poisoning has been around for a long time , but the number of reported cases has surged , from 33,700 in 1980 to 47,800 last year . Those figures represent only a small fraction of the problem , since most cases , - while unpleasant , pass quickly and go unreported . Experts believe that each year as many as 4 million Americans have a bout with salmonella . Occasionally the infection is serious enough to require hospitalization , and it can lead to arthritis , neurological problems and even death . The elderly , AIDS sufferers and others with weakened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims 2,000 lives annually . <P> One reason for the spread of salmonella , ironically , is Americans ' determination to guard their health . In the quest to keep cholesterol levels down , people are turning more often to low-fat poultry : annual per capita consumption of chicken alone has risen from 40 lbs . in 1970 to more than 70 lbs . this year . Unfortunately , mass-production techniques make many poultry farms and plants prime breeding grounds for salmonella . Different strains of the bacteria can contaminate eggs as well as meat . ( Raw cow 's milk can also be tainted , but beef is less of a problem than poultry because the slaughtering process is cleaner . ) <P> Chickens typically travel a filthy path from the farm through the slaughterhouse . Stuffed 10 or 12 to a cage on the truck to the processing plant , they eat one another 's germ-laden excrement and spread it on their feathers and skin . At the plant , the birds move rapidly along a disassembly line where they are killed , dropped in scalding water , mechanically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that usually become contaminated . " This is really no different than putting these birds in your toilet , " contends Gerald Kuester , a microbiologist with the Public Citizen advocacy group . <P> Poultry producers are trying to deal with the situation . They put chlorine in the chilling tanks , and they are experimenting with other chemicals in hopes of finding one that is more effective against salmonella . Irradiation could wipe out the bacteria , but it would be costly and consumer acceptance might be low , since many people mistakenly believe that zapping food with radiation makes it dangerous to eat . The visual inspections carried out routinely in the plants can weed out obviously diseased chickens , but the contamination is usually invisible . A panel of experts convened by the government may recommend soon that the Department of Agriculture develop better tests to detect salmonella.
