I was three , no more , when I spotted for the first time the paleness of his shirt moving like some small ghost against the darkening trees . Even now , the image remains , fixed in the scent of moldering wood : a man standing on a stone porch at dusk , his left hand crossed below his chest , smoking a pipe . It 's June . Unaware of us approaching through the darkness under the trees , he stares ahead into the gathering night as though the past itself were engraved there , as though the dip and weave of swallows in the last light were inscribing his fate on the disembodied air . From the path below , holding my father 's hand , I see him above us . Fireflies rise around him in slow , languid gusts like sparks from some missing fire . <p> lt 's been nearly twenty years now since I last saw Rheinhold Cerny , since my feet , barefoot or sneakered , negotiated the footpath to the cabin on the hill . From where it left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that path was as familiar to me as my own mother 's face . I could have run it blind , stutter-stepping through the marshy grass , swinging wide around the poison ivy , hitting the plank over the brook , right , left , right , then up and over the boulder with its little opaque windows of mica before leaping the strange , jointed root on the second turn past the shed . . . as though my feet , hitting earth and stone and wood , had stamped , by some alchemy of correspondence , each and every feature into the soil of my heart . <p> It would be Mrs. Cerny I saw first , standing in the garden wearing an oddly formal dress and a wide straw hat , pulling blooms past their prime , loosening soil with a spade . She 'd turn or straighten when I called from the bottom of the meadow , then walk up with me through the uncut grass into the chill shade of the cottage , where she 'd pour mint tea with honey and ply me with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my lips and chin . The cottage itself , always dark despite the cut flowers still blooming on the windowsills and tables , smelled of smoke and stone , wool blankets and sweet tobacco , and I 'd linger happily , dangling my feet off the rough oak bench by the dining-room table . We did n't talk and did n't need to . I 'd sit and eat , and she 'd busy herself in the living room or the kitchen , coring a piece of fruit or sweeping the crumbs off the counter into an open palm with quick , expert movements I found strangely reassuring . Nearly sixty at the time , she still had about her an old-world style , an unthinking diplomacy and tact . <p> We both knew , of course , that it was n't the honeyed tea or the jahodovy tac that brought me dashing down the path every Saturday morning , and just about the time I 'd begin to fidget and peer out the living-room window , she 'd be standing by the back door , calling " Rheinhole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after that I 'd spot him ( momentarily caught in the frame of the kitchen window like some forest spirit escaping its own portrait ) , walking through the knee-high bracken . Spare and tall , inescapably patrician in his grass-stained khakis and small , frameless glasses ( despite the weeds caught in the straps of his sandals and the dirt caked on his hands ) , he 'd first wash his arms to the elbows in the basin by the door , then carefully brush the dry dirt off his soles with a few strokes of a stiff-combed brush that hung from a nail above the bench . Only when these things were done would he look in . <p> " Vitnme vds , " he 'd say , never smiling despite the absurd formality of the greeting . " I see you 've fortified yourself well for the rigors of the day . Truly a chip off the old block , eh ? " he 'd add to his wife . " His father , too , is always prepared . " Mrs. Cerny , answering from the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chuckle , then beckon me through the doorway with a sweep of his arm like a coachman in a medieval fairy tale . " Pujdeme ? " he 'd ask . Shall we ? <p> The teasing , mild enough and diluted still further by a very real affection , meant little to me then . If it ever made me uncomfortable , if I ever sensed a touch of condescension beneath the banter , I assume I accepted it as somehow justified , given my own family 's flailings and failures , or ignored it by virtue of the mercenary single vision of childhood . Rheinhold Cerny , you see , built or brought or showed me things , week in and week out , and for this , more than anything else , I loved him . <p> While my own father was off in the one-room shed that had once served as a ham radio station , typing on the old Underwood with the broken e and c keys , Cerny was pointing to the bloodred crest of a woodpecker as long as my arm , pounding fist-size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through an opening he 'd cut in the shoreline thickets , a pickerel and its shadow in the sunlit flat by the swamp . A luna moth , ghostly and pale , that he 'd trapped against the screen at night , an old coffee tin with a half-dozen turtle eggs wrapped in moss , a barred feather , perfect and huge , that he 'd found in the garden-each week it was something new . <p> The pain of returning to the city every Sunday night from September to June would be lessened , time and again , by the wonders in the trunk of the car or on the seat next to me , wonders a quiet six-year-old well down the first-grade pecking order could ride , like a pet panther , into the hearts of all the Sherrys and Susies and Samanthas for the short space of each week 's show-and-tell , eclipsing utterly the urban Lotharios reduced to peddling their fathers ' collections of watermarked three-cent stamps . Sometimes , indeed , my contributions required an advance call or two-as much for courtesy as clearance-to prepare teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buzzing inside a gallon jar , or a milk snake in a box with a sliding glass lid , or an outraged baby heron-given to both fish puree delivered through a paper straw and rhythmic and unremitting shrieking-standing onelegged at the bottom of a parrot cage . <p> Distracted as they may have been by their own lives , my parents were nonetheless quick to recognize the power and status these things conferred , and rarely stood in my way . Whatever their feelings for Cerny ( and I was alert enough to pick up , even at that age , their growing resentment of the man-of his brusqueness , his patrician airs , his position in the emigre community ... ) , they could n't help but appreciate ( at least partly because they may have suspected , in their weaker moments , that Cemy 's condescension was not entirely unjustified ) his kindness to me . In a world without grandfathers , Cerny had , with a certain amount of rough grace , stepped into the role , and if relations with the middle generation were a bit strained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families . Our apartment on the fifteenth floor above 63rd Road in Queens soon took on a strangely animate cast-feathered , furred , and antlered-and my father , burying whatever jealousy he may have felt for my benefit , simply stepped , like a rejected suitor , back into the shadows . My mother , though temperamentally more cautious , less quick to concede , eventually followed suit . <p> They would have done well to pay attention . I can say this now , of course , because time , like an inverted telescope , shows clearly what was once too close , what proximity ( and love ) kept hidden . Eye to the lens , fully thirty-five years and more since those summer afternoons I spent in his company , I see again the square-fingered strength of his hands , the veins in his pale wrists where they emerged from his shirt always rolled one button up , the way he would peel his rimless glasses from his face to wipe the sweat or grime with a clean handkerchief . I remember the comfort of his silence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nod of approval I 'd receive for understanding something he 'd shown me , or applying it well . The burst of tart on my lips , the smell of orange mushrooms ( laid out to dry in the sun like battalions of fingersize soldiers ) , the stench of the mud where the goldenbloom grew . . . all these I remember . All these I see . <p> But the landscape now reaches easily from sun to dark , skirting depths I never knew : Cemy 's descriptions-always precise , analytical-of nature 's horrors ; his chuckle on finding the oddly human head of the mantis he had kept for months in a tabletop cage ( the cat had apparently moved the lid ) , staring up from the living-room carpet like some ghastly green mint . Or the particular look in his eyes-detachment , perhaps-that morning we watched a mud-dauber wasp , iridescent and thin , battling for its life in a spider web under the eave of the outhouse . Wrenching , thrashing , buzzing furiously , it tried to bring its abdomen around but found itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the drawnout desperation of the thing moved me , I recall , and I thought of bringing a stick down through the web to set it free , but one glance at Cerny put the thought from my mind . We watched the wasp disappear , bit by bit , leg by leg , until all that was left was the buzzing , and then even this grew muffled , and the spider , straddling his trussed and broken feast , delivered the fatal sting to the pathetic cocoon dangling in the shadow of the eave . <p> I am aware , of course , that none of this troubled me then , that I felt nothing but love for this man-for his gruffness , his way with the world-and saw nothing but love returned . I am aware , too , of how easily the past is shaped by our fantasies and fears . I have heard , finally , those who say that the past , like any distorting medium , like water , bends whatever enters it , and that the truth or lie of the broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am reminded of all these things by a small , perfect skull , hardly larger than my fist , which sits on a pile of books on my desk . Rheinhold Cerny gave it to me two days before my seventh birthday , and I can remember still , with absolute clarity , the thrill of expectation rising in my chest as he led me by the hand to the compost heap and then-carefully , almost tenderly-began digging in the dirt with a small stick . I remember the bones growing up out of the soil , seeing for the first time the sockets of the maxilla , the rounded ball joint at the base , the perfect and beautiful ferocity of the canines . I remember the way he brushed it clean with an old toothbrush he took from his pocket , the way the skull fit the jaw like a lid on a wellmade box-hinged and tight-and I remember him holding it up to me , in front of his face , and opening and closing its jaws in time with his own . <p> And I look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twisted himself that same afternoon almost forty years ago ) , and I say to those who claim the past is forever unknown to us , fuck you gentlemen , fuck you all , for I have run my hand the length of the broken oar , and I know what is bent , and I know what is whole . Rheinhold Cerny , almost smiling behind his rimless glasses , his hands , hinged at the wrist , dramatically opening and closing the jaws of that long-lost raccoon for the benefit of a little boy stunned with gratitude , is someone I loved like a father . This much is true . And this also is true : in his own particular way , he was a monster beyond reckoning . <p> It began . I suppse , the night my father turned the old Desoto off the blacktop onto the rutted dirt road that ran around the lake . Already sleeping , my face pressed into the crease of the seat , I woke to the sound of the grass between the wheel ruts swishing against the steel beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lurch . Thinking I still slept , my parents were quiet . Every now and then I could hear them whisper to each other in the dark , a word or two , no more . <p> " What 's that in the road ? " said my mother suddenly . <p> " I do n't know , " said my father . By the time he 'd eased the car to a stop in the darkness and turned off the motor , I was up and staring blearyeyed at what appeared to be a dog-size stone or lump of mud set down at the end of the headlights ' beam . Taking the flashlight from the glove compartment , my father turned off the headlights . It was as though the car around us had suddenly disappeared . Night was everywhere . Insects sawed back and forth in the trees , wild , arrhythmic , an army of elfin woodsmen . " Let 's have a look , " he said . <p> It was n't until we were ten feet away that we realized the thing was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It seemed emerged from some other world , accidentally caught in the land of families and electricity and cars . Leeches big as my father 's thumb clung to its scales ; its skin , loose and leathery , bulged around its head and legs . It struck at us as we came near , once , twice , hissing with each awkward lunge , then settled back , its gaping mouth pale in the flashlight 's beam . The smell of mud rot and carrion rose in the air . <p> My father , squatting with the flashlight in one hand and a crooked stick he 'd picked up off the road in the other , shook his head in wonder . " Ty ses mne obluda " - you are a monster-he said quietly to the turtle hunkered down in the dirt . Then , practicing his newly acquired English : " How are you ? What 's up ? " The turtle hissed softly . " Fine , thanks , " said my father . " Not much . And you ? " He chuckled . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother . " Stop tormenting the poor turtle with your English . " <p> " Nothing like this back home , Helen , " my father said , and , squat-stepping forward a few feet , he waved the stick in front of the snapper 's jaws . " Na toto jsme emigrovali . " For this we emigrated . His words were punctuated by a hissing lunge and the clack of jaws . A foot-long piece of my father 's stick lay in the dirt . <p> Rather than move the thing , we drove around it , I recall , the car bumping and scraping up and over the shoulder to the soft ground of the meadow , then back onto the dirt . Looking back through the rear window , I saw it sprout its Pleistocene head and clawed legs and begin plodding , heavily , through the redness of the taillights toward the still waters of the lake . <p> From that day forth , the snapper filled my child 's need for unseen things to fear ; reeking , primitive , it moved , always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic , a resonance , it might never have had without it . Every swirl , every half-glimpsed shadow , every sensed or half-sensed thing moving in the deep green rooms cut by the shadows of trunk and branch , hinted at its presence ; hinted , that is , until , on some still afternoon , gentle as a Corot painting , an angler in a rowboat , lulled into disbelief , would start at the sudden apparition risen by his side : ungainly , anachronistic , a griffin on a table . <p> I see him standing at the end of his dock at dusk , a large salad bowl of crusted bread cradled in the crook of his arm . With his free hand he tosses handfuls of bread , like flakes of light , to a family of swans . They duck and glide around him , wriggling their feathered tails . One rises , flapping , its wings momentarily pinned against the dark water . Getting down on one knee , like a suitor proposing to his spell-locked love , Cemy reaches out . Although I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though frozen in time : his body , balanced and sure , the paleness of his extended arm , her neck dipping gently down . <p> I remember the swans above all , but Cerny 's love was hardly that selective . A practical , rational man for all the years I knew him , he nonetheless had one weakness . No fewer than half a dozen bird feeders , some with suet , some with seeds , surrounded his cottage ; houses for wrens and grosbeaks and woodpeckers , lovingly built and situated , peeked from under eaves and branches or nestled in the crotches of oaks . A pair of ancient Zeiss binoculars , bulky and strong , were never far from his reach , and his ear , like a trained musician 's , could pick out the slightest change in the twittering , peeping ensemble performing round the clock , it sometimes seemed , for his benefit and his alone . <p> Calls , nesting habits , migration patterns and flight characteristics , identifying marks both at rest and on the wing ( and all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the irregular verbs of some dying language , until he was able not just to speak it but to understand it , inhabit it . On certain spring mornings , I remember , I would find him standing with his eyes closed in some far corner of the garden , the expression on his hypnotized features-the slight , involuntary movements of his lips and eyes beneath their lids-suggesting a beatitude bordering on rapture . Feeling slightly awkward , I 'd wait silently for the spell to pass . He always knew I was there . " Poslouchej , Mostovsky , " he 'd say quietly , his right hand raised like the hand of Adam to some ascendant god . " Poslouchej . " Listen . " To je kr6sa . " That is beauty . <p> I was n't there when it happened . I did n't see the swan , pushing eagerly through the shallows to Cer 's dock , suddenly jar , then plunge like a child 's cork beneath the surface . I did n't see the one wing cutting the boiling water , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark . <p> But I 'd seen it before and accepted it somehow . During the course of every summer , fully half the ducklings would die , abruptly wrenched into oblivion . And every May , the survivors would be back , paddling the shallows , nesting in the reeds . Life seethed and sank and rose again . More profound than profligate , nature threw its endless battalions into the consuming fire , then drew them forth again . Everywhere it was the same : the frog , I knew , spasmodically kicking its way down the snake 's expanding throat , had left strings of milky pearls in the shallows of the brook ; the cottontail , still running in the taloned air , had fathered dozens . . . " Only waste is wrong , " my father had told me once , and of all his lessons that faltered or failed , that one stayed true . <p> But Rheinhold Cerny , standing in his rowboat , helplessly plunging a wooden oar into the watery dark where bits of down now seemed to jerk and swim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world by some other , starker calculus : creation , like a stuttering watch , had revealed its flaw and had to be made right . Calmly , he presented his case : the turtles were ugly , served no discernible purpose , regularly killed the waterfowl whose beauty and grace were cherished by every local resident , young and old . He himself had seen them pull down a full-grown swan . Clearly , it was time to reduce their numbers , to lend a shaping hand to a situation badly out of control . He himself would do the work , take care of all the details . All he asked of his neighbors was their leave to do what , regretfully , needed to be done . <p> My father alone tried to protest the plan , to ask questions , though even he , frustrated as always by the older man 's reasoned maturity , his air of seasoned wisdom , his perfectly calibrated condescension , soon found himself helpless . Sitting with my mother on the Cernys ' stone porch one deep summer evening , yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside the cottage , my father , hunching foward in his wicker chair , tried to raise the subject . Why not wait to see if the depradations continued ? he asked . Why not call some expert for advice ? Or why not simply pick up a few of the nesting turtles and transport them to another lake ? <p> Leaning back , one trousered leg draped easily over the other , Cerny picked a pouch of tobacco off the table , opened the sumptuous , black foil , and began to stuff his pipe . A single flick of his wrist and a match flared . Holding it to the bowl , he took two meditative puffs , each accompanied by a slight popping sound of the lips . " Mily pane Mostovsky " - my dear Mr. Mostovsky - he said finally , his voice wearily descending the syllables like a parent lowering itself to speak to a particularly obtuse child : " The depradations have continued long enough . Experts can only confirm what we already know . And as for wandering about the countryside , hoping to stumble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is a solution that strikes me as singularly ineffectual . No , my dear sir " - and here I could see my mother gently place her hand on my father 's arm- " what must be done must be done , and , as the Americans are fond of saying , a job worth doing is worth doing well . " <p> " That would depend on the job , " said my father quietly , his jaw set . " Jak rozumite " - suit yourself-said Cem , and then , to his wife : " What about that cake you 've been promising us , my dear . " <p> Ever competent , ever thorough , like a carpenter in his workshop , he gathered his tools : thirty plastic gallon jugs , carefully rinsed of milk or vinegar or carburetor fluid ; forty yards of doublegauge wire , rolled off the wooden spool at Washburn 's store ; fifty stainless-steel hooks , size 6/0 , from the small , saltwater fishing section of Mazolla 's Bait and Tackle . <p> Mazolla 's son , Paul , bagged the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substituting , by the usual hunter 's shorthand , the object of the quest for subject and verb and everything else . " I beg your pardon ? " <p> " You goin ' for bluefish ? " He pointed . " The hooks . " <p> " Ah , yes . No . " Then , after a pause : " Turtles , I 'm afraid . " " Turtles ? " asked Mazolla , uncomprehending . " What for ? " <p> Cemy accepted the bag and change . " Because , young man , they 're a nuisance . " The little brass bell over the door had already jangled his exit when Mazolla spoke again . <p> " That 's a lot of turtles , " he said , nodding toward the small paper sack . Cernv Daused in the oDen door . <p> " All of them , " he said quietly . <p> But then nothing happened . <p> Those few who had given the matter any thought in the first place simply forgot about it , assuming , with some small relief , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way or abandoned the plan altogether . Labor Day came and went , bringing with it the return exodus to the city . By late September , the majority of cottages hidden behind the trees stood locked and silent . <p> My family was usually among the few who insisted on pushing the season , yet that year , hindered by my father 's obligations in town , we came rarely . I remember long , hazy days spent playing on the city playgrounds or in vacant lots , the huge blocky shadows of the buildings advancing a strange silence across the heated asphalt , dulling , as though underwater , the far drone of the freeway . I argued and cried , of course , for a last weekend , a last escape , before the long rain of November set in , but there was no help for it . <p> You can imagine my joy , then , and my parents ' relief , when the Goldsteins , our neighbors at the lake , offered to pick me up early one Friday morning in mid-October , take me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner . They were going , they said , to clean and lock up for the winter . I was welcome to come along . At six o'clock the next morning , I was waiting with my father in the first light along 63rd Road , holding only a lunch bag , a two-piece rod , and a tackle box into which my mother had slipped a change of socks . <p> The first thing I remember from that day is smoke rising straight as an exclamation point above the trees from the Cerms ' cabin . The second is seeing something white burst above the water under the overhanging trees , disappear , then rise again a few yards down . <p> I had rowed quite close before I realized the thing was a plastic jug , wired like a huge cork to something under the surface . I tried to catch it with an oar , but each time I approached , the jug-as though alive , and not merely an indicator of something living below-would plow a panicked furrow under the surface , reappearing a few yards away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while , and then-I do n't know why-instead of rowing on to the Cemys ' dock , slid the rowboat into the reeds and set off on foot . <p> There were no omens , no premonitions . The garden was empty , the house strangely silent . Smoke like a quickly blurring ghost still issued from the stone chimney . I did n't call or hallo the cottage or the shed but instead walked around the house and into the woods as though following a string , straight to the top of a small , wooded rise . <p> Below me , inside a chicken-wire enclosure nailed to a circle of trees and carefully staked to the ground , was Rheinhold Cerny , in hip boots and work gloves , moving about an old stone garden . A wheelbarrow lay on its side , its third wheel slowly spinning . To the left , by the fence , lay a pile of white plastic jugs , each connected to what appeared to be a fist-size rock . I was about to call when a movement in the far end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wire fence . <p> The mind runs slower than the eyes-it took me a moment to grasp what I saw . When I did , I vomited in the ferns . <p> Distracted by his work , Rheinhold Cerny never noticed the little boy crouching like an animal in the bracken . To this day , if he lives , he lives unsuspecting that someone saw what he did that October day , that someone watched , like Dante over the ninth abyss , as he walked among the dying and the damned still dragging at the end of a yard-long wire the jugs by which he 'd drawn them from the deep ; how he pulled them to the wooden circle , one by one , their thick clawed legs scraping resistant furrows in the dirt ; how he placed a foot on their useless shells , drew out their leathery necks by the wire still clamped to the hook in their throats , then severed their heads with two or three blows of a well-honed hatchet . <p> Even now I see them crawling , their reptilian hearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden heads ( still twisting and snapping like animate roots wrenched from troubled soil ) , past the growing pile of jugs by the fence , past their own brothers , who might hiss , if able , or continue on , mute like themselves , to the fence , which last barrier they would then begin to climb-unbelievably , absurdly-as though the memory of freedom had somehow outlived both their comprehension of it and their need for it , as though stopping their lives on the other side of a chickenwire fence were a matter of some importance . <p> Pausing in his work , Rheinhold Cerny pushed up his glasses with his shoulder ( his right arm pointing straight ahead as though indicating something in the distance to an unseen companion ) , then walked to the fence . Carefully removing one soaked glove with the other , he hung them over the top wire like a pair of small bodies , freshly killed , then reached for something he 'd left in the crotch of a tree . The lenses on his face sparked , then died . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tilt his head in that familiar gesture I 'd come to know so well , but by then the branches were already whipping at my face and I was flying headlong from the petrified silence of that place ( marred only by the scrapings of claws on dirt ) and the sight of Rheinhold Cerny seated on an overturned bucket , one leg draped over the other , enjoying a smoke before completing his work . <p> I said nothing , revealed nothing , quick , like most children , to feel shamed by the shameful acts of others . I removed that day from my memory like a photograph from an album . The next season , I saw Cerny again . I smiled at his teasing , listened to his anecdotes , accepted his gifts . And if , like any absent or invisible thing , that emptiness ordered the world around it , if it affected my life in any way at all , it did it in the time-honored way of troubled ghosts and buried memories , by supplying action and effect without agent or cause , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ways I could neither control nor fully understand . I developed a lifelong affinity for the silent and forgotten , for those who could n't scream . I swerved around snakes , stopped for tortoises , picked snails off rainy sidewalks . It was as though , forty years dead and buried , even the bone of their shells reduced to dust , the snappers still stumbled inside of me , as though their indomitable blood were somehow my own , as though the compassion never shown to them had been passed , through the offices of my own shuttered heart , to all their kind . <p> Just so will evil sometimes undo itself , give birth to the sons and daughters who bury its fondest dreams . . <p> Footnote
