<p> THE MAN WHO invented dinner theater was asked recently if it bothers him that his brainchild has become the very paradigm of middlebrow entertainment for middle-aged suburbanites . <p> " Well , in a way it does , " says Bill Pullinsi , who opened the first dinner theater 32 years ago . " Some of the theaters do very good work , and others do it occasionally , and others do n't do it . I would rather that they all did really good work , but it 's hit and miss . " <p> Locally it 's more hit than miss . Which seems appropriate , since Washington is the birthplace of dinner theater . That 's right , downtown Washington , in fact : 13th and G streets NW , the site of the Presidential Arms Hotel . <p> There , in the summer of 1959 , Pullinsi kicked off a 12-week season in his Candlelight Dinner Playhouse . He and his crew made a little money on the venture , coaxed applause from local critics and were sufficiently encouraged to mount a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went back to his native Chicago and opened a year-round dinner theater , which is still alive and cooking . <p> The Presidential Arms is long gone , razed a decade ago , but the spirit of the Candlelight still burns here . Today upwards of a dozen dinner theaters operate in the Washington and Baltimore suburbs . <p> Recent samplings of the menus and theatrical fare at 10 of these establishments generally attest to the central claim of their proprietors : We offer a good deal . <p> The cost of an evening at the dinner theaters reviewed below is about $ 36 per person , on average . That covers both a meal with one drink , tax and tip and a play . ( Do n't worry about parking ; that 's always free . ) Think of it as $ 18 for the meal and $ 18 for the show . <p> For that not to be a good deal , every aspect of the package would have to be hopelessly cheesy . And that was n't the case with any of the dinner theaters we reviewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good and occasionally delectable , especially the desserts . <p> At all but a few places ( West End , Fells Point and , for now , Annapolis ) the meal  --  be it dinner or brunch  --  is buffet-style . You come in , you get seated , you order a drink from a server who may also be a member of the show 's cast . In time , the server or a host invites you to join the chow line , where the wait is usually short . <p> The buffets we encountered were clean and well stocked , typically with several salad fixings , a few hot vegetables , four or five entrees and three or four desserts . If any element was consistently disappointing , it was the vegetable section . Kitchen personnel everywhere seem incapable of preventing steam tables from turning veggies into mush . <p> About 15 to 30 minutes before curtain , your server tells you the buffet is about to close , and also takes advance orders for drinks served at intermission . <p> Instead of adjourning to a separate room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supper table . ( Oddly , most dinner theaters are furnished with thinly padded , steel-framed , armless chairs instead of the extra-comfy models you might expect . ) <p> At intermission , you settle up for drinks not included in the ticket price ( generally only coffee is included ) and also work out a tip for your server . Whether or not your server is a cast member , it 's customary to base the gratuity on the total ticket price , plus drinks  --  the theaters will usually remind you of this . <p> As for the performance itself , count on being entertained but do n't expect to be floored . Dinner theater is like minor-league baseball . The players are professional but seldom top-flight , as the very best of them bolt for the majors as soon as they can . At any number of local dinner theaters , you stand a chance of seeing talented newcomers who are destined for steady employment on Broadway or in Hollywood . Trouble is , it 's hard to predict which shows will feature these rising stars , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By contrast , the quality of the play itself is quite predictable . Most dinner-theater shows are certified hits . <p> Right now , for instance , six local outfits are mounting musicals that once boomed on Broadway : " The Sound of Music " ( at two places ) , " Carousel , " " My Fair Lady , " " Fiddler on the Roof " and " Kismet . " Three other houses included here are putting on similarly light-hearted shows , such as " A Christmas Carol , " " It 's a Wonderful Life " and " Little Mary Sunshine . " <p> Theatergoing purists have been known to sneer at such fare , declaring that it does n't challenge the audience or break new artistic ground . But those criticisms miss the point of dinner theater , which is to entertain people efficiently , cheaply and safely . <p> " You 're not really taking a risk when you buy a ticket to see ' Carousel ' because you know what ' Carousel ' is and you know it 's entertaining , " says Ken Dresser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner of stages . " Whereas I 'm going to go see ' Two Trains Running ' tonight a new August Wilson play at the Kennedy Center and I do n't know what I 'm going to see . I do n't know if I 'm going to like it or not . " ( He liked it . ) <p> Dresser believes that the dinner-theater format is ideal for introducing non-theatergoers to the conventions of live drama . Dinner-theater owners believe this , too , of course , and several have lately begun to capitalize on the notion by putting on regular shows for youngsters . Typically these are Saturday matinees for which tickets are in the $ 6 to $ 8 range . That may seem a little more costly than a movie outing , but consider that it 's live entertainment by professional actors , and that a snack is included in the price . Such is the simple charm of dinner theater , and always has been . ANNAPOLIS DINNER THEATER <p> You 're almost at the Bay Bridge by the time you reach the exit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has charms enough to stop you from just heading on to the beach . The room is attractively lighted and the tables carefully tiered , so there 's no need to worry about sight lines . The current production of " A Christmas Carol " is unusual in that dinner ( or brunch ) is served during the show : Ebenezer Scrooge 's jovial host Mr. Fezziwig invites everyone to join his party , and the cast is suddenly whisking plates of turkey and all the trimmings to each table . Children appreciate the theater 's high level of audience participation , which includes greetings from Santa upon entering and from a gantlet of cast members upon exiting . <p> ANNAPOLIS DINNER THEATER  --  339 Revell Hwy. , Annapolis , Md. 410/974-0058 . Current show : " A Christmas Carol , " through Dec. 28 . Coming : " The Foreigner , " " Gypsy . " Performances Thursday through Saturday evenings and Sunday matinees . Tickets $ 24.50 to $ 31.25 . MasterCard and Visa . Group discounts and season subscriptions available . In the children 's Saturday matinee series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Factory , " through Jan. 11 . Upcoming : " Charlotte 's Web , " " Alice in Wonderland . " Tickets are $ 7.95 , which includes a modest lunch . BURN BRAE DINNER THEATER <p> Burn Brae has been in business since 1968 , so owner John Kinnamon and his crew have had loads of time to get their act together . They 've used it well . The buffet and the stage performance are equally lavish . In " Fiddler on the Roof , " the large cast shows that ambitious dance numbers can be executed on a relatively small stage . The singing is good throughout , and two voices are particularly fine : Teresa Rohan 's as Hodel and Rodney Fayman 's as Tevye . <p> BURN BRAE DINNER THEATER  --  U.S. 29 at Blackburn Road , Burtonsville. 301/384-5800 . Current show : " Fiddler on the Roof , " through Dec. 31 . Coming : " Driving Miss Daisy , " " The Music Man . " Performances Tuesday through Sunday evenings , with matinees on Wednesday and Sunday . Tickets $ 25.95 to $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Visa and Discover . Group discounts and season subscriptions available . In the children 's Saturday matinee series , the current show is " Babes in Toyland , " through Jan. 11 . One Saturday each month , magician John Eiken performs . Tickets are $ 6.50 , which includes a snack . BERNIE 'S BAR MITZVAH <p> " Bernie 's Bar Mitzvah " is like one of those staged murder mysteries in which audience members mingle with the players and help solve the crime . With " Bernie 's , " though , there 's no inciting event , no buildup , no climax . What transpires is a simulated bar mitzvah celebration in which audience members mingle with the cast , dine uncommonly well and marvel at the enterprise 's many realistic touches . <p> The Fells Point Cabaret Theater bears little resemblance to any traditional dinner theater . You spend the first hour of the affair in a modish bistro , noshing on tasty hors d'oeuvres and ordering whatever you want from an open bar . Everyone 's dressed up , but you can tell most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , you figure out which women are performers . They 're the ones buttonholing people to regale them with gossip about the bar mitzvah boy 's parents ( Mark and Judy Bernstein ) and their in-laws and friends . Once you get your bearings , you find yourself gleefully anticipating the sorts of things you 'd run from at a normal party : obnoxious chitchat , asinine spats . Such intercourse forms the bulk of playwright Howard Perloff 's fluid script . <p> The nuttiness continues when everyone files into the adjacent dining room for a sit-down dinner and , eventually , lots of dancing . Speeches are made ; the Bernsteins argue with each other and their guests . At a few points , you think you 're about to witness a dramatic confrontation that will crystallize the foregoing events . But it never happens . <p> When the show ends , you walk out of the dining room and discover that the bistro is n't merely a set . Real patrons lay claim to it soon after the " Bernie 's " audience goes next door to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bistro from the dining room , they seem curious , as if they want to ask , What was going on in there ? <p> Very good question . <p> FELLS POINT CABARET THEATER  --  723 S. Broadway , Baltimore . 301/327-8800 . Current show : " Bernie 's Bar Mitzvah , " through March 1 . Performances Friday through Sunday evenings . Tickets for the **25;432;TOOLONG affair $ 55 Friday and Sunday , $ 65 Saturday . American Express , Visa , MasterCard . Group discount available . <p> HARLEQUIN DINNER THEATRE <p> The Harlequin Dinner Theatre would be a good place to see " Camelot . " Once you get past the warehouselike exterior , you 'll find warm , baronial-wood decor and long , mead-hall tables of patrons ( sit at the end of the table closest to a tier 's edge to avoid craning your neck ) . The buffet offers plenty of options and the drink-and-dessert table service is exceptionally efficient . ( Next season the theater plans to match its cuisine to its shows  --  chicken Kiev with " Fiddler on the Roof , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't skimp on production values ; sets and costumes of its recent " Some Like It Hot " were clever and elegant , and the chorus had chorines aplenty . <p> HARLEQUIN DINNER THEATRE  --  1330 E. Gude Dr. , Rockville. 301/340-8515 . Current show : " Kismet , " through Dec. 31 . Coming : " Phantom of the Opera " ( an adaptation , not Andrew Lloyd Webber 's version ) . Performances Tuesday through Sunday evenings , with matinees on Wednesdays and Sundays . Tickets $ 32.95 and $ 34.95 . MasterCard and Visa . Group discounts and season subscriptions available . Children 's weekend- matinee series will begin in May . LAZY SUSAN DINNER THEATRE <p> Take the Woodbridge exit off I-95 and you 'll spot the Lazy Susan , a sprawling ranch house with pink siding adorned with all manner of medallions , doodads and drawings of stagecoaches . Step inside , and a collection of kitsch awaits  --  a papier-mache angel , myriad faux-Tiffany lighting fixtures and a taxidermic menagerie including a giant peacock and an elk breaking though one wall . The two-tiered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  --  a melange of Pennsylvania Dutch dishes and standard steam-table fare  --  certainly lives up to its name . The best thing about Lazy Susan , however , is its staff . The able performers/waiters do an amazing job of welcoming , serving , singing , clearing , acting and more . One minute your waiter is bringing you drinks , and then , in the blink of an eye , he 's onstage dancing or crooning his heart out . The energetic performances make up for the ultra-basic sets and costumes . <p> LAZY SUSAN DINNER THEATRE  --  I-95 at Exit 54 , Woodbridge . 703/550-7384 . Current show : " Little Mary Sunshine , " through Dec. 31 . Coming : " Murder at the Vicarage , " " Oklahoma . " Performances are Tuesday through Sunday evenings , with one Sunday matinee per month . Tickets $ 26.95 and $ 28.95 . American Express , MasterCard and Visa . Group discounts and season subscriptions are available . OREGON RIDGE DINNER THEATER <p> The Oregon Ridge Dinner Theater is the performance space of the Baltimore Actors Theater Conservatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim that this makes it more artistically earnest than a typical dinner theater , but in fact the differences are few . If you 're a dinner-theater fan , you 'll like this place . The room has a capacity of 165 , about 35 percent smaller than average , which heightens the intimacy . The lighting is romantically low and the furnishings are above average in elegance . In terms of food presentation and stagecraft , however , Oregon Ridge is hardly a standout . In its recent " Phantom of the Opera , " only a couple of the lead voices were terrific , most were okay and one was noticeably feeble . By the way , this " Phantom , " which will return in the spring , is not the Andrew Lloyd Webber version . You may leave the theater smiling , but you probably wo n't be humming any of the tunes . <p> OREGON RIDGE DINNER THEATER  --  13403 Beaver Dam Rd. , Cockeysville , Md. 410/771-8427 . Current show : " The Sound of Music , " through Feb. 28 . Coming : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evenings , with Sunday matinees . Tickets $ 25 and $ 28.50 . Visa and MasterCard . Group discounts available . The children 's theater series is elaborate , with full-scale musicals performed with orchestras . The program resumes in February . Tickets $ 4 . PETRUCCI 'S <p> Petrucci 's is housed in a former movie theater , so the dining room is grandly proportioned , with a big stage up front and a balcony in the rear . Too bad the food and theatrical presentations were n't similarly imposing recently . The buffet had a sad , thrown-together appearance , and the house sound system played Muzak-like tunes until a few minutes before the show started . The curtain lifted to reveal a comically tiny merry-go-round , which set the tone for the rest of this sluggish " Carousel . " <p> PETRUCCI 'S DINNER THEATER  --  312 Main St. , Laurel . 301/470-3436 . Current show : " Carousel , " through Dec. 31 , and " A Christmas Carol , " through Dec. 30 . Coming : " Something 's Afoot , " " The Unsinkable Molly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wednesday and Sunday matinees . Tickets $ 26.95 and $ 31.95 . Visa and MasterCard . Group discounts and subscriptions available . TOBY 'S <p> Not exactly theater-in-the-round ( too many angles ) , Toby 's nonetheless offers good views of its central performance/buffet area . Once the steam tables have been whisked away , you look down or directly across at the actors on the floor . And if you must leave during the show , you may have to squeeze by sets and actors on their way in . But you 'll probably want to stay : The current production of " South Pacific " ( in repertory with " It 's a Wonderful Life " ) even has strong leads in its alternating weekend cast , and a letter-perfect Bloody Mary and Billis . Choreography is zippy and there 's a great shower scene . <p> TOBY 'S  --  South Entrance Road just off U.S. 29 , Columbia ( on the grounds of Merriweather Post Pavilion ) . 301/596-6161 . Current show : " It 's a Wonderful Life , " through Dec. 29 and Jan. 7-19 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's " A Wonderful Life " ) and " South Pacific , " returning Dec. 31-Jan. 5 and Jan. 21-Feb. 2 .

Currently showing : " Charlotte 's Web , " through Dec. 28 ( with a possible extension through January ) . Tickets are $ 7 , which includes snacks and a souvenir . WEST END DINNER THEATER <p> The West End Dinner Theater is a big theater behind a small storefront in a strip shopping center . The ambitions are big too , with a raw seafood bar , the only standard table service at an area dinner theater and the chutzpah to do a tweaky show like " Nunsense , " which also had , thankfully , a live music combo . Everything works but the table service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice and controls portions more than some patrons would like . The bright cast handled the audience-participation moments nimbly , boding well for even meatier productions to come . <p> WEST END DINNER THEATER  --  4615 Duke St. , Alexandria . 703/370-2500 .

Though the dining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sumptuous , offering the finest desserts we encountered . The White Marsh Dinner Theater 's current production of " My Fair Lady " is delightful despite a gruff , burly Henry Higgins who has trouble keeping a British accent . <p> WHITE MARSH DINNER THEATER  --  8204 Belair Rd. , Baltimore . 410/882-0060 .
