THE CHAIRMAN OF the board pulled the door shut behind him , stacked his rifle against the log-sided cabin , and walked down to the end of the porch . The light from the kitchen window punched out into the early-morning darkness and the utter silence of the woods . Two weeks of nightly frost had killed the insects and had driven the amphibians into hibernation : for a few seconds , he was alone . Then the chairman yawned and unzipped his bib overalls , unbuttoned his pants , shuffled his feet , the porch boards creaking under his insulated hunting boots . Nothing like a good leak to start the day , he thought . As he leaned over the low porch rail , he heard the door opening behind him . He paid no attention . Three men and a woman filed out of the house , pretended not to notice him . " Need some snow , " the woman said , peering into the dark . Susan O'Dell was a slender forty , with a tanned , dry face , steady brown eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was strapped around her blaze-orange stocking cap , but she had n't yet switched it on . She wore a blaze-orange Browning parka , snowmobile pants , and carried a backpack and a Remington .308 mountain rifle with a Leupold Vari-X III scope . Not visible was the rifle 's custom trigger job . The trigger would break at exactly two and a half pounds . " Cold sonofabitch , though , " said Wilson McDonald , as he slipped one heavy arm through his gun sling . McDonald was a large man , and much too heavy : in his hunting suit he looked like a blaze-orange Pillsbury Doughboy . He carried an aging .30-06 with open sights , bought in the thirties at Abercrombie &; Fitch in New York . At forty-two , he believed in a certain kind of tradition -- his summer car , a racing-green XK-E , was handed down from his father ; his rifle came from his grandfather ; and his spot in the country club from his great-grandfather . He would defend the Jaguar against far better cars ; the .30-06 against more modern rifles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , blacks and Jews . " You all ready ? " asked the chairman of the board , as he came back toward them , buttoning his pants . He was a fleshy , red-faced man , the oldest of the group , with a thick shock of white hair and caterpillar-sized eyebrows . As he got closer to the others , he could smell the odor of pancakes and coffee still steaming off them . " I do n't want anybody stumbling around in the goddamn woods just when it 's getting good . " They all nodded : they 'd all been here before . " Getting late , " said O'Dell . She wore the parka hood down , and the parka itself was still unzipped ; but she 'd wrapped a red and white kaffiyeh around her neck and chin . Purchased on a whim in the Old City of Jerusalem , and meant to protect an Arab from the desert sun , it was now protecting a third-generation Irishwoman from the Minnesota cold . " We better get out there and get settled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deer season . O'Dell led the way off the porch , the chairman of the board at her shoulder , the other three men trailing behind . Terrance Robles was the youngest of them , still in his mid-thirties . He was a blocky man with thick , black-rimmed glasses and a thin , curly beard . His watery blue eyes showed a nervous flash , and he laughed too often , a shallow , uncertain chuckle . He carried a stainless Sako .270 , mounted with a satin-finished Nikon scope . Robles had little regard for tradition : everything he hunted with was new technology . James T. Bone might have been Susan O'Dell 's brother : forty , as she was , Bone was slim , tanned , and dark-eyed , his face showing a hint of humor in a surface that was hard as a nut . He brought up the rear with a .243 Mauser Model 66 cradled in his bent left arm . Four of the five -- the chairman of the board , Robles , O'Dell , and Bone -- were serious hunters . The chairman 's father had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rambling stone-and-redwood home on Blueberry Lake south of Itasca , and his father had been big in Rotary and the Legion . The deer hunt was an annual ritual : the chairman of the board had hung twenty-plus bucks in his forty-six years : real men did n't kill does . Robles had come to hunting as an adult , joining an elk hunt as a thirtieth-birthday goof , only to be overwhelmed by its emotional power . For the past five years he 'd hunted a half-dozen times annually , from Alaska to New Zealand . O'Dell was a rancher 's daughter . Her father owned twenty miles of South Dakota just east of the Wyoming line , and she 'd joined the annual antelope hunt when she was eight . During her college years at Smith , when the other girls had gone to Ivy League football games with their beaux , she 'd flown home for the shooting . Bone was from Mississippi . He 'd learned to hunt as a child , because he wanted to eat . Once , when he was nine , he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully shot blackbirds . Only McDonald disdained the hunt . He 'd shot deer in the past -- he was a Minnesota male , and males of a certain class were expected to do that -- but he considered the hunt a pain in the ass . If he killed a deer , he 'd have to gut it . Then he 'd smell bad and get blood on his clothing . Then he 'd have to do something with the meat . A wasted day . At the club , they 'd be playing some serious gin -- drinking some serious gin , he thought -- and here he was , about to climb a goddamned tree . " Goddamnit , " he said aloud . " What ? " The chairman grunted , turned to look at him . " Nothing . Stray thought , " McDonald said . One benefit : If you killed a deer , people at the club attributed to you a certain common touch -- not commonness , which would be a problem , but contact with the earth , which some of them perceived as a virtue . That was worth something ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . THE SCENT OF woodsmoke hung around the cabin , but gave way to the pungent odor of burr oaks as they pushed out into the trees . Fifty yards from the cabin , as they moved out of range of the house lights , O'Dell switched on her headlamp , and the chairman turned on a hand flash . Dawn was forty-five minutes away , but the moonless sky was clear , and they could see a long thread of stars above the trail : the Dipper pointing down to the North Star . " Great night , " Bone said , his face turned to the sky . A small lake lay just downslope from the cabin like a smoked mirror . They followed a shoreline trail for a hundred and fifty yards , moved single file up a ridge , and continued on , still parallel to the lake . " Do n't step in the shit , " the woman said , her voice a snapping break in the silence . She caught a pile of fresh deer droppings with her headlamp , like a handful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Cove Links deal , " the chairman said dryly . The ridge separated the lake and a tamarack swamp . Fifty yards further on , Robles said , " I guess this is me , " and turned off to the left toward the swamp . As he broke away from the group , he switched on his flash , said , " Good luck , guys , " and disappeared down a narrow trail toward his tree stand . The chairman of the board was next . Another path broke to the left , toward the swamp , and he took it , saying , " See you . " " Get the buck , " said O'Dell , and McDonald , O'Dell , and Bone continued on . THE CHAIRMAN followed the narrow flashlight beam forty-five yards down a gentle slope to the edge of the swamp . The lake was still open , but the swamp was freezing out , the shallow pockets of water showing windowpane ice . One stumpy burr oak stood at the boundary of the swamp ; the kind of oak an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat pocket , took out a long length of nylon parachute cord , looped it around his rifle sling , leaned the rifle against the tree , and began climbing the foot spikes that he 'd driven into the tree eight years earlier . He 'd taken three bucks from this stand . The county road foreman , who 'd been cleaning ditches in preparation for the snow months , told him that a twelve-pointer had moved into the neighborhood during the summer . The foreman had seen him cutting down this way , across the middle of the swamp toward this very tree . Not more than two weeks ago . The chairman clambered into the stand fifteen feet up the tree , and settled into the bench with his back to the oak . The stand looked like a suburban deck , built of preservative-treated two-by-sixes , with a two-by-four railing that served as a gun rest . The chairman slipped off his pack , hung it from a spike to his right , and pulled the rifle up with the parachute cord . The cartridges were still warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't last long . Temperatures were in the teens , with an icy wind cutting at exposed skin . Later in the day , it would warm up , maybe into the upper thirties , but sitting up here , early , exposed , it would get real damn cold . Freeze the ass off that fuckin ' O'Dell . O'Dell always made out that she was impervious to cold ; but this day would get to her . The chairman , wrapped in nylon and Thinsulate , was still a little too warm from the hike in , and he half dozed as he sat in the tree , waiting for first light . He woke once more to the sound of a deer walking through the dried oak leaves , apparently following a game trail down to the swamp . The animal settled on the hillside behind him . Now that was interesting . Forty or fifty yards away , no more . Still up the ridge , but it should be visible after sunrise , if it moved again . If it did n't , he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He sat waiting , listening to the wind . Most of the oaks still carried their leaves , dead brown , but hanging on . When he closed his eyes , their movement sounded like a crackling of a small , intimate wood fire . The chairman sighed : so much to do . THE KILLER WAS dressed in blaze orange and was moving quietly and quickly along the track . Dawn was not far away and the window of opportunity could be measured in minutes : Here : now twenty-four steps down the track . One , two , three , four , five could use a light . The oak tree was there , its bark rough against the fingertips . And just to the right , a little hollow in the ground behind a fallen aspen . Just get down here ... quietly , quietly ! Did he hear me ? These leaves ... did n't think about the leaves yesterday , now it sounds like I 'm walking on cornflakes ... Where 's that log , must be right here , must be ... ah ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at exactly the right height for a rifle rest . A quick glance through the scope : nothing but a dark disc . What time ? My God , my watch has stopped . No . Six-seventeen . Okay . There 's time . Settle down . And listen ! If anybody comes , may have to shoot ... Now what time ? Six-eighteen . Only two minutes gone ? Ca n't remember ... two minutes , I think . There 'd be only one run at this . There were other people nearby , and they were armed . If someone else came stumbling along the track , and saw the orange coat crouched in the hole ... If they came while it was dark , maybe I could run , hide . But maybe , if they thought I was a deer , they 'd shoot at me . What then ? No . If someone comes , I take the shot then , whoever it is . Two shots are okay . I can take two . It would n't look like an accident anymore , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's that ? Who 's there ? Somebody ? The killer sat in the hole and strained to hear : but the only sounds were the dry leaves that still hung from the trees , shaking in the wind ; the scraping of branches ; and the cool wind itself . Check the watch . Getting close , now . Nobody moving , I 'm okay . Cold down here , though . Colder than I thought . Have to be ready ... The old man ... have to think about the old man . If he 's there , at the cabin , I 'll have to take him . And if his wife 's there , have to take her ... That 's okay : they 're old ... Still nothing in the scope . Where 's the sun ? DANIEL S. KRESGE was the chairman of the board , president , and chief executive officer of the Polaris Bank System . He 'd gathered the titles to him like an archaic old Soviet dictator . And he ran his regime like a dictator : two hundred and fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cost-cutting fist . If everything went exactly right , he would hold his job for another fifteen months , when Polaris would be folded into Midland Holding , owner of six hundred banks in the south central states . There would be some casualties . The combined banks ' central administration would be in Fort Worth . Not many Polaris executives would make the move . In fact , the whole central administrative section would eventually disappear , along with much of top management . Bone would probably land on his feet : his investments division was one of the main profit centers at Polaris , and he 'd attracted some attention . O'Dell ran the retail end of Polaris . Midland would need somebody who knew the territory , at least for a while , so she could wind up as the number two or three person in Midland 's retail division . She would n't like that . Would she take it ? Kresge was not sure . Robles would hang on for a while : a pure technician , he ran data services for Polaris , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Midland data systems . McDonald was dead meat . Mortgage divisions did n't make much anymore , and Midland already had a mortgage division -- which they were trying to dump , as it happened . Kresge turned the thought of the casualties in his head : when they actually started working on the details of the merger , he 'd have to sweeten things for the Polaris execs who 'd be putting the parts together , and the people Midland would need : Robles , for sure . Probably O'Dell and Bone . McDonald ? Fuck him . KRESGE WOULD LOSE his job along with the rest . Unlike the others , he 'd walk with something in the range of an after-tax forty million dollars . And he 'd be free . In two weeks , Kresge would sit in a courtroom and solemnly swear that his marriage was irretrievably broken . His wife had agreed not to seek alimony . In return for that concession , she 'd demanded -- and he 'd agreed to give her -- better than seventy-five percent of their joint assets . Eight million dollars . Letting go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things he 'd ever done . But it was worth it : there 'd be no strings on him . When she 'd signed the deal , neither his wife nor her wolverine attorney had understood what the then-brewing merger might mean . No idea that there 'd be a golden parachute for the chairman . And his ex would n't get a nickel of the new money . He smiled as he thought about it . She 'd hired the wolverine specifically to fuck him on the settlement , and thought she had . Wait 'll the word got into the newspapers about his settlement . And it would get in the newspapers . Fuck her . Forty million . He knew what he 'd do with it . He 'd leave the Twin Cities behind , first thing . He was tired of the cold . Move out to L.A. Buy some suits . Maybe one of those BMW two-seaters , the 850 . He 'd been a good , gray Minnesota banker all of his life . Now he 'd take his money to L.A. and live a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could do with forty million dollars in the city of angels . Hell , the women alone ... KRESGE OPENED HIS eyes again with a sudden awareness of the increasing cold : shivered and carefully shook the stiffness out . Looking to the east , back toward the cabin , he could see an unmistakable streak of lighter sky . There was a ruffling of leaves to his right , a steady trampling sound . Another deer went by , a shadow in the semi-dark as the animal picked its way through a border of finger-thick alders at the fringe of the swamp . No antlers that he could see . He watched until the deer disappeared into the tamarack . He picked up the rifle then , resisted the temptation to work the bolt , to check that the rifle was loaded . He knew it was , and working the bolt would be noisy . He flicked the safety off , then back on . The last few minutes crawled by . Ten minutes before the season opened , the forest was still gray to the eye ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miraculously brighter . Then he heard a single , distant shot : nobody here on the farm . Another shot followed a minute later , then two or three shots over the next couple of minutes : hunters jumping the gun . He glanced at his watch . Two minutes . Nothing moving out over the swamp . THROUGH THE SCOPE , the target looked like an oversized pumpkin , fifteen or twenty feet up the tree . His body from the hips down was out of sight , as was his right arm . The killer could see a large part of his back , but not the face . The crosshairs of the low-power scope caressed the target 's spine , and the killer 's finger lay lightly on the trigger . Got ta be him . Damn this light , ca n't see . Turn your head . Come on , turn your head . Look at me . Have to do something , sun 's getting up , have to do something . Look at me . There we go ! Keep turning , keep turning ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gunfire became general . Nothing too close , though , Kresge thought . Either the other guys were holding off , or nothing was moving beneath them . What about the deer that had settled off to his left ? He turned on the bench , moving slowly , carefully , and looked that way . In the last few seconds of his life , Daniel S. Kresge first saw the blaze-orange jacket , then the face . He recognized the killer and thought , What the hell ? Then the face moved down and he realized that the dark circle below the hood was the objective end of the scope and the scope was pointed his way , so the barrel ... ah , Jesus .  - -   - -   - -   - -  JESUS WENT THROUGH Kresge 's mind at the same instant the bullet punched through his heart . The chairman of the board spun off the bench -- feeling no pain , feeling nothing at all -- his rifle falling to the ground . He knelt for a moment at the railing , like a man taking communion ; then his back buckled and he fell under the railing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a foggy way , hit it face first , with a thump , and his neck broke . He bounced onto his back , his eyes still open : the brightening sky was gone . He never felt the hand that probed for his carotid artery , looking for a pulse . He would lie there for a while , head downhill , would Daniel S. Kresge , a hole in his chest , with a mouth full of dirt and oak leaves . Nobody would run to see what the gunshot was about . There would be no calls to 911 . No snoops . Just another day on the hunt . A real bad day for the chairman of the board .
