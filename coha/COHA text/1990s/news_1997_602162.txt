<p> No one can accuse Kim Jong Il of being hasty . <p> The 55-year-old son of North Korea 's founding leader , Kim Il Sung , waited more than three years after his father 's death to assume the official title that confirms the first transfer of power from father to son in a communist nation . <p> On Wednesday , the younger Kim finally was named general secretary of the Workers Party of Korea . How he uses this new stature will be critical to the fate of the world 's last Cold War division , not to mention 23 million North Koreans contending with hunger and economic decline . <p> For most Americans , Kim , to paraphrase Winston Churchill , is a mystery wrapped within an enigma . No Americans can travel to North Korea without that country 's permission . Few have gone there and none have met Kim . <p> But the North Korean leader is far more scrutable than he seems . Although he has shunned high-level Westerners , he has met ethnic Koreans from abroad and senior politicians from China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Russian Communist , Oleg Shenin , who described Kim as a " dynamic , purposeful leader . " On Wednesday , Shenin said Kim 's formal elevation should accelerate " all negotiations between Pyongyang and the outside world . " <p> Perhaps not coincidentally , North Korea and South Korea agreed Wednesday to open each other 's skies to commercial airlines for the first time since the peninsula was divided 52 years ago . <p> Kim is not yet a frequent flyer . He is known to have traveled only to China in 1983 and East Berlin in 1984 . His experience of the West is through cable TV and movies . A list of 100 films requested for the viewing of the North Korean elite two years ago ran the gamut from Gone With The Wind to the action thrillers of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis . <p> Kim has been doing more than watching movies . Anointed a communist crown prince in 1980 , he was named to his father 's most important post  --  commander of the 1.1-million member army  --  in 1992 . Since 1994 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cautious opening to the West . <p> " Somebody has been making decisions in North Korea , " says Don Oberdorfer , a veteran former foreign correspondent and author of a new book , The Two Koreas . " The people around Kim say that somebody was him . " <p> Among decisions made during this period : agreeing to a landmark deal with the United States , trading North Korea 's nuclear-weapons potential for civilian reactors ; apologizing to South Korea for sending a submarine that ran aground there ; appealing for international aid to ease food shortages that have caused thousands of deaths ; and permitting a handful of foreign relief workers and U.S. reporters to glimpse the hunger . <p> There have been no pronouncements from Kim on what most outsiders regard as the most urgent need : reform of the creaky , collectivized economy so that the country can feed itself . But the government has quietly allowed its people to bend socialism to stave off famine . <p> The International Fund for Agricultural Development , a U.N . organization , is planning loans for individual families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Portland , Ore. - based charity Mercy Corps . Farmers have been allowed to keep more crops , although there has been no wholesale dismantling of collective farms as occurred when China began its reforms 20 years ago . <p> Americans have yet to gauge Kim as a person . The closest the Clinton administration has come was when a State Department officer witnessed Kim from afar at a 1996 party on Kim 's birthday in Pyongyang . <p> U.S. intelligence analysts have been reduced to scrutinizing TV tapes and hunting for hints of policy changes within propagandistic tomes . One such kernel appeared in August : " We have no intention to regard the United States as our eternal sworn enemy , " Kim wrote . " We hope to normalize the Korea-U.S. relationship . " <p> North Korean diplomats have been saying this privately for years but this is believed to be the first time Kim has made such a declaration to the public at large . <p> Since the first authorized diplomatic meetings in 1988 , the two countries have become engaged in a variety of contacts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and recovery of remains of Americans missing in action from the Korean War . <p> The North Koreans also have agreed to attend talks with South Korea , the United States and China on reducing tensions but have not approved an agenda , perhaps waiting for South Korea to choose a new leader in December . <p> Largely shut off from outside influences , North Koreans have been shaped by a propaganda machine that is unusual even by communist standards . It hails Kim Il Sung as the greatest leader the world has known and invests his firstborn with amazing feats , including a golf score of 40 and the ability to read four lines of a book at a time . <p> North Koreans have been taught that Kim was born on Mount Paekdu , legendary birthplace of the Korean people , and that a double rainbow appeared at his birth . In fact , Kim is believed to have been born in Russian Manchuria . <p> Kim 's childhood was hardly pampered . When he was 7 , his mother died delivering a stillborn baby . Kim and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War . They have two half brothers and two half sisters by Kim Il Sung 's second wife . <p> Married twice and with at least one male child , Kim gained a reputation for high living in his youth , although most of the stories come from defectors and thus are suspect . Clearly , Kim adored movies , going so far as to write a 300-page book on the subject in 1973 , On the Theory of the Cinema . He also reportedly authorized the kidnapping in 1978 of a South Korean film director and his actress wife . <p> Other acts attributed to Kim include a 1983 bombing in Burma that killed most of the South Korean Cabinet . Kim also had responsibility for North Korea 's nuclear program , which almost led to war on the Korean peninsula in 1994 when North Korea unloaded spent fuel rods from which highly radioactive plutonium could have been extracted . One of the few places in the country where a huge billboard of Kim appears alone  --  instead of in a customary duo with his father  --  is at Yongbyon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's death , Kim authorized an agreement with the United States that ended the nuclear standoff . But he retreated from public view and there were rumors that he was ill . U.S. intelligence experts say Kim has diabetes but that it is controlled by medication . <p> In the past year , Kim has become much more visible . He is shown on TV visiting small groups of Koreans , often military units , and giving " on-the-spot guidance " as his father used to do . But most North Koreans have yet to hear him . According to Oberdorfer , the only time Kim 's voice has been broadcast was in 1992 when he was heard declaring , " Glory to the people 's heroic military ! " <p> Strenuous efforts have been made this year to merge the identities of Kim , father and son . " The most popular slogan has been ' One is the other , ' " says Han Park , a professor of political science at the University of Georgia . North Koreans also have begun to refer to the younger Kim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " great leader , " the title given to his father . <p> Kim 's father was a charismatic figure who despite the harsh nature of his regime had stature as a hero in the resistance against Japanese occupation . " Kim 's father was almost like Muhammed Ali , the way he would smile and go around and meet people and press the flesh , " says Bruce Cumings , author of Korea 's Place in the Sun , a history of the peninsula from ancient to modern times . " Kim is much more reserved . " <p> The key question , Korea experts say , is whether the son has the courage  --  and support within the party and military  --  to alter his father 's legacy . " North Korea needs economic development for which opening up the society is imperative , " says Park . " But no elite is willing to risk its own survival . "
