Section : The Nature of Learning <p> Chimpanzees in Tanzania use small twigs to " fish " for termites in the tunnels of their rock-hard mounds . Across the continent in Gabon , chimpanzees take large sticks , smash the mounds open , and attempt to scoop up the fleeing termites . These different techniques for gaining access to termite mounds might seem a matter of ecology : more rain falls in Gabon , for instance , making the mounds softer and easier to get into . But whatever technique they use , the chimpanzees in a given area are strongly influenced by tradition , going after termites in the same way members of their group have done for generations . Such group traditions are often referred to as primate culture . <p> Chimpanzees learn much of what they need to know  --  not just the best way to go after tasty termites but also where to find water , what predators to look out for , and which members of their group to avoid  --  by staying close to their mothers and picking up on hints in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a termite mound in Tanzania will typically come across discarded twigs ( sometimes with termites crawling on them ) or perhaps twigs already stuck into tunnels on the termite mounds . Similarly , a young chimp in Gabon may find a large stick protruding from a gash in a soft mound . In both situations , young chimpanzees will undoubtedly be in a position to observe groupmates foraging for the nutritious insects . Such hints may be all a novice needs to get started . <p> " Socially assisted " learning is a vital part of human culture , too , but with a subtle and , it turns out , crucial difference . This difference may help explain why the chimpanzee toolbox is currently limited to some modified twigs for termite fishing , rocks for bashing nuts open , and leaves to sop up water , while even a modestly equipped human household generally contains many tools  --  in Western culture , such things as screwdrivers , pliers , and hammers , not to mention toasters and toilet plungers . <p> To investigate differences in social learning in humans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children and captive chimpanzees . In one experiment , chimps and two-year-old children watched as a human demonstrator used a rakelike tool to drag some food ( usually fruit ) or toys ( Nerf balls or jacks , for example ) closer to them . One side of the rake had several widely spaced prongs ; the other was solid and flat . We divided the chimps and children into groups so that some observed an inefficient method , in which the desired object slipped through the prongs , while others watched as demonstrators flipped the rake over and dragged the object in . <p> Overall , humans and chimpanzees proved equally skillful at getting what they wanted with the rake . What differed was how they made use of what they had observed . The children concentrated on imitating the demonstrator 's techniques , even when that meant frustration and failure as the desired object slipped through the prongs time and time again ; they only flipped the rake over if they had seen the demonstrator do it . The chimps , in contrast , tended to ignore the technique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once they grasped the idea that the rake could be used to move the food around , they devised their own strategy . We call this type of learning emulation because it is aimed at reproducing results , not methods . <p> Emulation is a perfectly good way of maintaining many cultural traditions , such as chimp termite fishing or some types of human tool use . But paradoxically , imitation is more likely to lead to the steady accumulation of new  --  and often more complex and efficient  --  tools , ideas , and traditions . It is this accumulation that characterizes human culture . The tendency to imitate ( or at least pay close enough attention to a technique so that one could duplicate it ) means that innovations made by one individual are likely to be studied closely and faithfully copied by others , who are now in a position to discover further modifications . As a result , new and improved forms have the potential to spread widely . For example , to hammer one thing into another , human beings began with stones , proceeded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a range of tools from ball peen hammers to steam-driven pile drivers . <p> ( Of course , for much of human history , change came slowly ; Achulean hand axes made by Homo erectus stayed pretty much the same for hundreds of thousands of years . With the cultural explosion of the Upper Paleolithic , however  --  with its cave paintings and sophisticated tool kits  --  the rate of change accelerated greatly . All modern cultures are thus rich in artifacts that have evolved over time . No chimpanzee culture is . ) <p> Much imitation in human culture is accompanied by explicit instruction . Chimpanzees do not appear to actively try to teach one another how to do things , or at least not often In more than a decade of fieldwork in the Tai Forest of Africa 's Ivory Coast , primatologist Christophe Boesch , of the Zoological Institute of the University of Basel , reported only two clear examples of teaching in chimpanzees , both involving mothers and juvenile offspring learning how to open nuts with a rock . <p> Every human parent , in contrast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do something " right "  --  whether tying shoes , following a recipe , or speaking properly  --  and all children have been equally frustrated at being so ordered about , often objecting that their creativity is being squashed . The common parental response , " Once you know how to do it right , then you can do it your way , " may be more significant than we generally realize . Exact imitation reinforced by explicit instruction may be close to the heart of what makes human culture what it is : the collective creation of countless individuals over many generations , each attempting much of the time to do exactly what everyone else is doing . Location , Location , Location ! <p> How do zebras learn where the water hole is ? How do kittens learn to find the litter box for the first time ? The answer is local enhancement  --  the increased attraction of an animal to a location because of another animal 's presence . Once in the right spot , learning takes place most easily between animals of the same species , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  Annette Heist <p> <p> Chimpanzees fishing for termites <p> ILLUSTRATIONS <p> Developed and edited by Rebecca Finnell <p> Drawings by Robert Grossman <p> By Michael Tomasello <p>
