<p> DRUG lord Pablo Escobar is on the run . Cocaine and heroin seizures are up . Illicit drug consumption is falling in Canada and the United States . But no one is celebrating . Instead , frustration is rising among top antidrug officials thoughout the Americas . <p> " The more we seem to get rid of the problem , the greater it seems to grow , " says Miguel Angel Gonzalez Felix , coordinator of human rights and narcotrafficking in Mexico 's Ministry of External Relations . " Our jails are full of narcotraffickers . We 've had more success at interdiction , but now cultivation and local addiction are increasing . It 's like a water balloon . We squeeze one side and it pops out the other . " <p> This frustration is forging an unprecedented level of cooperation among nations in this hemisphere . It provoked calls for a major overhaul of antidrug strategy at the 13th semiannual meeting of the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission ( CICAD ) here last week . <p> " This has become much more than a national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to unite and coordinate strategy . There is not a country in the Americas that does n't have both problems of consumption and trafficking now , " said Jose Eduardo Marti Guillo , secretary of the Guatemalan Commission Against Addiction and Trafficking of Illicit Drugs , during a coffee break at the CICAD meeting . An antidrug forum <p> Founded in 1986 , CICAD is the branch of the Organization of American States that is becoming the forum for coordinating the region 's antidrug efforts . CICAD is funding and helping distribute information about national drug education programs . It has developed model legislation to curb money laundering and to control the shipment of chemicals used in manufacturing narcotics . It is setting up legal centers to promote equality of laws and more transnational cooperation between judges and prosecutors . <p> " CICAD is a very important multilateral forum for us . No other organization focuses on this as a hemispheric problem , " says Eva Kmiecic , director general of Canada 's police and law enforcement directorate . <p> But as little as three or four years ago the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereignty and corruption . They would classify each other as " producer " or " transit " or " consumer " states . They are now being drawn together by a foe which makes no such distinctions . <p> One nation after another reports rising consumption of hard drugs . Most Latin American nations lack statistical studies , but based on drug seizures , arrests , hospital reports , and a few surveys , the trend is clear . <p> " Chile used to say they did n't need a drug education program , " says Irving Tragen , secretary gen eral of CICAD . " Last year , the government was shocked by a survey showing 18 percent of the high school students in northern Chile had used bazuko cocaine paste . As the US market declines , we 're now seeing a rapid increase in consumption all over Latin America . " <p> Experts cite a number of reasons for the trend . <p> Successful interdiction efforts in Mexico and the Caribbean have forced traffickers to adjust their distribution routes . More aircraft are now landing or dropping bundles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun paying their accomplices in drugs rather than cash . <p> " We 're starting to see the problem of consumption in depressed areas and rural areas of Latin America where there is no money , but now people are taking hard drugs . This is of great concern , " Mr. Gonzalez Felix says . <p> Consumption is rising in Europe , which also affects distribution routes . " There 's not an international airport or shipping port in Latin America that is n't used today to transship drugs , " says Juan Carlos Antoniassi , a liaison officer for the International Criminal Police Organization or Interpol . <p> Crackdowns on cocaine and heroin production in Colombia , Peru , and Bolivia have forced some growers and laboratories to move to neighboring countries . Economic growth is up in the region . And when demand drops in the US and Canada , traffickers have such a wide profit margin that they can unload surplus cocaine in Latin America at lower prices and still reap a profit . <p> " The problem of narcotrafficking is so serious , it 's destroying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have to cooperate . It 's a matter of survival , " says Senator Sonia Sgambatti , Venezuela 's representative to CICAD . Unity still eludes <p> Despite progress toward developing a regional consensus , some CICAD members say there is much left to accomplish before the region is truly unified in its fight against illicit narcotics . <p> " You can see the number of countries taking responsibility for the problem expanding . But there 's still much hypocrisy , " says Gabriel de Vega Pinzon , director of Colombia 's National Office of Narcotics . " For example , in many countries , there 's no control over chemical precursors . The commitment is only at the level of discussion . On the level of action , the promises are empty . " <p> But the political power and responsibility of CICAD representatives are growing , Alberto LeStelle , says Argentina 's Secretary of the Program for the Prevention of Drug Addiction and the Fight Against Narcotrafficking . " I hope some day to have drug control representatives at the ministerial level here . If we get secretaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire effort , then I 'll know we 're on the way to a real solution , " Mr. LeStelle adds . US strategy provides hope <p> Latin American countries in the past have been critical of the US for putting the majority of its antidrug money into interdiction and eradication programs abroad , rather than reducing consumption at home . So many CICAD members were encouraged by the US representative to the conference , J. Phillip McLean , who noted the decline in US consumption , and pledged to further reduce the demand for narcotics . <p> " We will make our biggest contribution to international narcotics control when we reduce drug use in the US year after year . The new administration will put its main emphasis on consumption , " said Mr. McLean , US deputy assistant secretary for Inter-American Affairs . <p> Meanwhile , the members of CICAD , following a proposal by Mexico , are embarking on a thorough evaluation of what has been accomplished to date and what new strategies are needed to combat the spreading narcotrafficking scourge . <p> " Many countries are doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of more sophisticated systems and tactics by the traffickers . So what are we going to do ? We need to review our strategies established in the last six years and plan ahead , " says Gonzalez Felix , Mexico 's representative to CICAD . <p> He cites the need for more fluid cooperation between national and international agencies . More could be done in the areas of money laundering , controlling arms trade , and funding alternative development strategies instead of crop eradication programs , he says . <p> The strategy rethink , and the trend toward greater cooperation is likely to force a change in US and United Nations aid programs to Latin America . <p> In the past , funding might go to one nation 's eradication or drug education program but not to a neighboring country . " One of the most important dimensions of the drug problem is that it does n't respect national boundaries . We must focus our assistance - economic and technical - in the same cross-boundary manner , " explains Mr. Tragen , the CICAD secretary general .
