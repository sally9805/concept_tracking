<p> NACOGDOCHES - For more than two decades , Braulio and Cleotilde Gutierrez worked punishing split shifts on the Walley family 's dairy farms in East Texas . <p> They ran the milking machines and tended to whatever other chores - including child care - they were assigned . <p> In the early years , the Gutierrezes said , they were paid $ 150 between them for working six days a week , up to 14 hours a day . Their shifts began in the darkness of early morning and ended in the darkness of evening , although they were given a midday break . They slept in a trailer with eight men . " " We had a little bed in the corner , " Cleotilde said . <p> Still , it was better than Montemorelos , the forlorn town in the Mexican state of Nuevo Leon that they 'd left in 1973 . <p> Eventually they moved into a Spartan - but rent-free - frame house by themselves . Their wages increased until each was earning slightly more than $ 2 an hour . They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty hills of Cherokee County , and were thankful they were n't confined to a squalid neighborhood in one of the nearby cities . They became permanent residents of the United States in 1988 . <p> Then , about a year ago , a cow kicked Braulio , 50 , on his left thigh . The blow was so hard that his entire upper leg was deeply bruised . Braulio said he could barely stand , let alone do the crouching and lifting his job required . <p> Cleotilde , 63 , tried to take up the slack , but it was impossible . On Jan. 11 , she and Braulio were fired . They had worked nearly 22 years for Roy Walley and , later , his son Johnny . <p> " " We 're hurt , " Cleotilde said , her eyes filling with tears . " " We <p> tried to do the best we could . " <p> The Gutierrezes have filed a federal lawsuit alleging labor violations by the Walleys , who deny the allegations . <p> The grinding conditions and sudden uprooting described by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas , said Richard Fischer , a Nacogdoches attorney representing the couple . <p> " " It 's routine , " said Fischer , a native of upstate New York who has practiced here for 13 years . " " It 's part of the economy : 65-plus hours a week for $ 150 plus a shack . " Injured workers , Fischer said , are " " lucky if they get taken to the doctor once . " Employers rarely carry workers compensation insurance , and even seasoned hands are coldly cast aside when they become disabled . <p> This is the reality behind what Fischer and others call the " " Pine Curtain , " the densely wooded , rural eastern third of Texas . It seems an unlikely destination for someone from the interior of Mexico . <p> Invisible immigrants <p> In fact , one can find plenty of immigrants in the region , but it takes some looking . Here are a few on a dairy farm near Rusk . Here are others raising chickens near Center , cutting timber outside of Lufkin , watering potted plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Highway 110 lists New Summerfield 's population as 521 . This is something of a local joke : A single business in town , Powell Plant Farms , employs up to 450 people , the vast majority of whom are Mexican men . Some have wives and children , as evidenced by the many brown faces outside the New Summerfield School on a recent weekday afternoon . <p> A tour of the countryside offers further proof of the area 's changing ethnicity . " " Mexicans , " said Adolfo Cantua , co-publisher of a Spanish-language newspaper in Jacksonville , as he drove past a cluster of trailers back in the pines . <p> " " Mexicans , " he said as he passed another a moment later . <p> " " Wherever you go , you see Mexican people . " <p> And yet officially , most of these people do n't exist . The 1990 Census missed some because they were n't here legally and did n't want to be found , others because they were simply too transient , too detached . <p> As a result of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may miss out on " " numbers-propelled " federal and state grants for economic development and other purposes , said Ron Claunch , a professor of political science at Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches . <p> Representation also can suffer . <p> Undercount affects area " " A lot of cities in East Texas have moved to single-member districts , and if there 's an undercount of Hispanics , that certainly affects the redistricting process , " Claunch said . <p> " " Various interest groups that represent the Hispanic community would be concerned about an undercount , because the greater the number of Hispanics they can document , the more pressure that puts on public officials to respond to that particular group . " <p> The immigrants who have settled in East Texas do n't present the sort of united front one might find in , say , the Lower Rio Grande Valley . To a great degree they are invisible . <p> " " They 're really isolated out there , " said David Hall , executive director of Texas Rural Legal Aid Inc. in Weslaco . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find in some of the Deep South pine-planting operations . A lot of the workers are undocumented and very difficult to reach . We 've not had much in the way of contacts and complaints from East Texas . It really is a Pine Curtain . " <p> " " It 's not like a big city , where you find a lot of ( Hispanic ) organizations , " said Cantua , 39 , who came to Jacksonville from Mexico 10 years ago to start the weekly La Opinionwith his wife , Judith . " " We do n't have LULAC ( League of United Latin American Citizens ) . We do n't have MALDEF ( Mexican-American Legal Defense Fund ) . The Mexicans are unable to defend themselves against a lot of things . " <p> A big , gregarious man , Cantua hears a litany of immigrants ' stories , most of which are sad and some of which are grotesque : A Mexican teen-ager has the skin torn off his penis when his pantleg gets caught in the axle of a tractor operated by a young boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electrocuted at a basket factory , the voltage so high that the flesh is consumed to the bone on part of his leg . <p> Although Cantua senses that the immigrants ' lot has improved , he is not deaf to the grousing around town : The Mexican kids are filling up our schools , the young men are taking our sons ' jobs , and so on . <p> " " This area is very . . . " - Cantua searched for a word - " " special . Some people here , they do n't like Hispanics . " <p> Sixty miles east of Jacksonville , in the town of Center , school officials are all but begging for bilingual teachers as the number of immigrant students soars . <p> " " We 're seeing more and more kids coming in from Mexico , " said Paula Monroe , director of federal programs for the Center Independent School District . " " The week before Thanksgiving we got a new family every day . " <p> Bilingual teachers needed <p> At last count the district had 217 enrollees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Other immigrant children have blended into the general student population . <p> " " It 's a challenge , " Monroe said , " " because we now have larger numbers of children who do n't speak any English . There are so many scattered throughout the classrooms that it 's impossible for us to spend as much time with them as we have in the past . <p> We do n't have any bilingual teachers , and we do n't have any applications on file . " <p> The district relies largely on two Spanish-speaking classroom aides and a migrant service coordinator to communicate with hundreds of children . <p> Despite the occasional strain on schools and social services , there is little question that without workers from Mexico , many agricultural businesses in East Texas would be forced to close or sharply scale back . <p> " " I would just have to shut down . There 's no doubt about it , " said Billy Powell , who owns Powell Plant Farms and who , Cantua said , has a reputation for fairness . <p> Powell employs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cultivate bedding plants in his 2 million square feet of greenhouses , which cover 50 acres . Much of the work - watering , transplanting - is unskilled and performed by immigrants , who start at about $ 5 an hour and typically work 50-hour weeks . <p> " " The workers we have here are real reliable , " Powell said . <p> " " Some of them have been here 15 or 20 years . " <p> Powell learned the true value of such people when the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service put up a roadblock just outside of New Summerfield last spring . By the time the operation had concluded , Powell was short 110 employees , some of whom had been apprehended for lack of documentation and some of whom had been frightened and left town on their own . <p> ( " " We do n't hire anybody here without the proper documents , " Powell said , " " but of course they can be falsified . " ) Powell was desperate : A big chunk of his work force had evaporated , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants . Powell went to the Texas Employment Commission office in Jacksonville and said he needed help . He got only five applicants - one through the TEC and four by word of mouth . He hired three , all Anglos , and they lasted until noon on their first day . <p> " " The American people do n't want to work , " Powell said , adding that in his greenhouses , " " the work is not hard . " Compared to , say , dairy farming or logging , Powell 's business is rather tame . Historically , agricultural work has been one of the most hazardous - and least-studied - occupations in America . The majority of the nation 's 3 million farmworkers are Hispanic . <p> In 1990 , the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health sought to make a dent in the extraordinary number of deaths , injuries and illnesses by establishing its first agricultural research center in Cooperstown , N.Y <p> It was " " very clear that agricultural health and safety was an issue that needed to be addressed and was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an assistant to the director of NIOSH 's Division of Respiratory Disease Studies in Morgantown , W. Va . <p> A high death rate Indeed , studies presented at a national conference in 1991 found that U.S. agricultural workers were dying on the job at the rate of 50 per 100,000 ; the rate for all industries combined was 11 per 100,000 . Each day , researchers reported , nearly 500 farmworkers were suffering disabling injuries , half resulting in permanent impairment . <p> The sources of farm injuries are diverse : people are gored by enraged bulls , become entangled in conveyor belts and fall from haylofts . They also develop all manner of disease : a painful skin condition known as dermatitis , caused by contact with harsh chemicals ; asthma from exposure to dust given off by dried chicken manure ; tuberculosis from living in close quarters . <p> As it happens , the seventh and newest NIOSH research center to be funded is in East Texas , at the University of Texas Health Center at Tyler . It will be directed by Dr. Arthur Frank , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , " " there is an inordinate number of injuries and even deaths among children related to farming activities . <p> Checking on safety <p> " " We 're going to look at machinery safety , animal-handling issues , respiratory disease from chicken- and turkey-raising , asthmalike problems related to molds and animal danders , " Frank said . He wants to delve into forestry and even commercial fishing on the Gulf Coast . <p> Cleotilde Gutierrez 's hands are testament to the harshness of farm work . They are as rough and beefy as a man 's . <p> " " They are swollen all the time , " she said , because of acid and bleach she used to clean the milking machines when she worked for the Walleys . " " The skin comes off . " <p> Braulio Gutierrez complains that his left leg , the one kicked by the cow a year ago , still swells and throbs , especially when he tries to bend it . His wife massages it every day . <p> The Gutierrezes say their wounds are not all physical . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnny Walley - whom she had helped raise - grew so exasperated with her inability to handle up to 250 cows , twice a day , that he cursed her and threw her to the ground . She cries when she tells the story . <p> Asked whether he had done such a thing , Walley said , " " Lord , no . I got better sense than that . " His father , Roy , could not be reached for comment . <p> Lawsuit seeks back wages <p> The Gutierrezes ' lawsuit , set for trial next spring , alleges that the Walleys violated federal minimum-wage laws . <p> They are seeking $ 111,496 , collectively , in back pay and damages . <p> Johnny Walley railed at this figure , saying the couple worked 35 to 50 hours a week , not 84 , as they claim in court documents ( although most people familar with East Texas dairy and poultry farms say that 70-plus-hour weeks for animal tenders are common ) . After his injury , Braulio would " " limp real bad when he 'd see me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " " It 's all a bunch of lies , " he said . " " We treated those people <p> good . There 's people in Houston that wish they got paid as well . It just got to where they did n't want to do their work . <p> This was a planned deal . They were looking for a way to retire . " <p> The Gutierrezes have not retired , and their lives could hardly be described as leisurely . They found seasonal employment at a Nacogdoches lawn-chair factory and are making $ 5.20 an hour apiece - 95 cents above minimum wage and a princely sum by their standards . But they will be laid off in the spring . <p> They live in a run-down trailer with their 39-year-old daughter and her three children , an arrangement they grudgingly accept . The trailer is in a wooded development south of Nacogdoches called Briar Forest , occupied almost exclusively by Mexican immigrants and notorious for its lack of city services and its deeply rutted , horseshoe-shaped dirt road .
