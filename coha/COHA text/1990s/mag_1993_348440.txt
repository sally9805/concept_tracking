HERE 'S A NOVEL WASHINGTON idea : an Administration that lives like America , a government that drives its own cars , pays for its own meals and flies coach . Of course , worrying over such things is generally derided as cheap theater that saves almost no money . Yet , as symbolism goes , Clinton 's plan to end limousine gridlock and severely limit the use of government planes is gratifying when one considers that a year or so ago flying on a government plane to a dentist appointment was not considered a firing offense . <P> A warm limo on a cold day set James Baker apart from normal working folks . Consequently , Clinton 's chief of staff , Mack McLarty , will be making his own way to the office . Of the 45 cars at hand for portal-to-portal service in the Bush Administration , only 16 will remain . That stack of six pristine daily newspapers on every desk in the West Wing : gone . White House mess privileges , which were what separated the merely important from the princes who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the clerks who sort the mail , if they can stand the food there . The White House staff will be 25% leaner starting the next fiscal year . Use of government airplanes will be nearly on a life-or- death basis , and Cabinet officials are urged to fly coach . Secretary of Labor Robert Reich , who is less than 5 ft. tall , admitted it will be no hardship for him , joking , " I do n't need the legroom . " <P> While the bowling alley in the White House will remain open , gone are the stables run by the National Park Service in Virginia , a perk much enjoyed by the Quayles . <P> Of course , there remains a perk gap  --  the chasm between what government officials give up and the privileges that remain . Presidential assistants are entitled to diplomatic passports , which means they can obtain them nearly overnight . For entertainment , there are the three presidential boxes at Kennedy Center theaters , which aides often use . Among the choicest berths are vacation homes in the Grand Tetons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The worst excesses have vanished . The presidential yacht Sequoia , which Nixon 's aides would take down the Potomac but abandon in favor of a helicopter for the trip back , has been sold . But do n't look for many bus trips . The President took his victory lap on Air Force One last Wednesday to go to the town meeting in Detroit . It 's a $181 million Boeing 747 with an office , computer center , conference room , bedroom , 85 phones , 18 televisions , soft lighting and an operating room for emergency surgery . Clinton put on the blue serge flight jacket with the presidential seal and settled in to work the phones . " It 's a lot better than Air Elvis , " he remarked , a reference to his campaign plane , which resembled a homeless shelter . It is better , and if he 's not careful , he will get used to it .
