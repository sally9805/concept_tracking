We have installed two colonies of Italian bees in a clearing beyond the apple orchard . They have settled into the hives , and , with a single-mindedness that is funny and impressive , go about the business of their miraculous , strange little universe . I watch them with almost parental affection  --  the buzzing , teeming clockwork , the workers cleaning cells , guarding the front door , foraging for nectar ; the short , fat drones , fatherless and stingless and indolent , swaggering about , hoping to get lucky with a virgin queen . <P> The analogies between keeping bees and raising adolescents are interesting . Both form highly developed societies that seem an alienated parody of our own . In both we glimpse , through the looking glass , intricate social lives and blind cruelty , the tendency to swarm occasionally , the secret language of waggle dances , the cliques , the stings , the feckless love lives of the drones . <P> One difference is that bees in the hive are ruthlessly serious about work  --  even , in a daffy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , pay dearly for their sexual pleasures . They die as they ejaculate , killed by the queen , who merely requires their sperm . Their function fulfilled , they die . In the human hive , the drones carry condoms in their wallets . Bees do their jobs ; if they do not , the whole outfit dies . From birth , bees are very serious about being bees . <P> Humans , on the other hand , have turned the long stretch from puberty to autonomy into a suspended state of simultaneous overindulgence and neglect . American adolescence tends to be disconnected from the adult world and from the functioning expectation ( the hope , the obligation ) of entering that world and assuming a responsible place there . The word adolescence means , literally , growing up . No growing up occurs if there is nothing to grow up to . Without the adult connection , adolescence becomes a neverland , a Mall of Lost Children . <P> In an op-ed article in the New York Times last week , Bard College president Leon Botstein had this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be abolished . " It 's a thought . As Botstein says , " At 16 , young Americans are prepared to be taken seriously ... They need to enter a world where they are not in a lunchroom with only their peers . " <P> Maybe we should abolish adolescence altogether . Not the biological part , of course  --  the turbulent growth spurt and mental/physical/social adaptation . We are stuck with that . But it would be nice if we could get rid of the cultural mess we have made of the teenage years . Having deprived children of an innocent childhood , the least we could do is rescue them from an adolescence corrupted by every sleazy , violent and commercially lucrative fantasy that untrammeled adult venality , high-horsing on the First Amendment , can conceive . <P> Our deeper trouble should be sought at sources that lie upriver , a generation in the past . Abolish adolescence ? We should have thought of that 30 or 35 years ago and terminated what became the prolonged adolescence of the baby boomers . The grownups in charge in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral center of gravity shifted from middle-aged authority to youthful impulse . So did the commercial center of gravity : the boomers were a gold mine . Now we live in an enduring vacuum of grownups , taken from us in the way that blight obliterated the American elm .
