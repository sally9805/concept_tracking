<p> As a combat correspondent in World War II , David Richardson strived to conquer his fears by joining in the fighting himself . <p> That led him to man machine guns on a B-24 bomber and a Sherman tank , crew on a PT boat , parachute with a special military team behind Japanese lines and trek hundreds of miles through Burma 's steamy jungles with a famed Army unit known as Merrill 's Marauders . <p> The story of his reportage , he said , could be summed up best as " " the confessions of a 4-F soldier who turned actor as a way of conquering fear in covering the war . " <p> He worked for Yank , a weekly news magazine the Army published for enlisted men and women , remarkably free of editorial restraints , with GIs like Richardson serving as correspondents . <p> With an estimated worldwide readership of 10 million , Yank published weekly editions in every theater of the war and " " contained pictures , cartoons , poems , pinups , nudes and first-hand stories from battlefields , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be hit over the head " " with the horror of it all , " he said . " " They knew it was hell . Our job was not just to report what was going on in combat . It also was to convey some of the humor , the irony . Humor is what keeps you going . A lot of it was grim humor , but it was there . " <p> Richardson , now 77 , went on to a distinguished , half-century journalistic career . He recounted his wartime experiences earlier this year at a World War II symposium presented by the Admiral Nimitz Museum , based at Fredericksburg . <p> In 1940 , he got his foot in the door at a great , now defunct American newspaper , the New York Herald-Tribune . Besieged by applicants in that Great Depression era , the Trib required aspiring young journalists to serve what amounted to three-year apprenticeships as copy boys , with a starting pay of $ 15 a week . <p> It did n't matter that Richardson had earned a journalism degree at Indiana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had some experience with other papers . That 's how he had to make his start . In fact , all the copy boys had college degrees , some even master 's degrees . <p> Six months later , as he was turning 25 , his draft board in New Jersey ordered him to report for induction into the Army . His co-workers threw a rollicking going-away party . <p> " " Skinny as a rail and 20 pounds underweight , " he said , " " I was a physical misfit who probably should never have been in the armed forces , much less anywhere near the fighting . " <p> So perhaps it should have come as no surprise doctors would classify him as 4-F and exempt from military service . <p> Notwithstanding that , he said , an official called him aside and told him that although he was n't obligated to serve , " " The Army needs college men . If you say so , we can grant you a waiver . " <p> " " I thought fast , " Richardson said . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my few possessions with my family . I did n't relish creeping back to the gang in my newspaper office after my big farewell ... so that 's how this 114-pound weakling became a soldier . " <p> " " In the four years that followed , " he added , " " I discovered I was n't the only fighting man who should n't have been . " <p> After Yank was created in 1942 , he managed to get on its staff . As a technical sergeant , he led two other Yank correspondents into Gen. Douglas MacArthur 's Southwest Pacific area to start an Australian edition of their magazine . They had authority to request transportation to go anywhere in the theater . <p> Richardson 's first exposure to combat came during the battle for Buna on New Guinea in late 1942 . " " It was some of the toughest fighting in the war , " he said . " " Much of the battle was fought in swamps and dense jungle . Casualties were heavy , and progress was agonizingly slow . Snipers seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " the best way to fight fear at the front was to keep as busy as you can . When I had nothing to do but watch , I got to trembling and shaking so much I could n't even take notes . <p> So I decided to seek out ways of doing combat tours myself . " <p> As a result , he said , " " I like to think I found a way to give a new dimension to covering the war by shifting my role from that of passive observer to that of active participant in the fighting . " <p> His first chance to do this came when he volunteered to be a waist gunner on a B-24 even though he did n't know how to operate a .50-caliber machine gun . He helped defend the bomber when four Japanese Zero fighters attacked it over the Solomon Islands . <p> Luckily for the U.S. fliers , the Zeroes , apparently low on fuel , broke off the attack . <p> " " I did learn how to put tracer bullets out in front of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more important I had a great story . " <p> Soon after this he " " stretched the truth again " to go on a PT boat mission . He said he could handle a Browning automatic rifle even though he had never even held one . But in a battle with Japanese landing craft on a dark night , he managed to fire the weapon . <p> In Burma he volunteered to parachute behind Japanese lines with a small OSS team . They spent several weeks leading native guerrillas in operations against the enemy . ( The OSS , or Office of Strategic Services , was an Army unit that became the forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency . ) <p> " " I made that first jump with less than two minutes instruction on the plane , " he said . " " Then the jumpmaster , an untrusting man , kicked me in the butt to make sure I got out . " <p> On another occasion in Burma , he " " faked " his way into manning a machine gun on a Sherman tank in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a tank before . He wound up in the command tank as a replacement for a regular gunner downed by diarrhea . <p> During the battle , he said , shell cases spit out by the machine gun made him blink so much he could n't really tell where he was firing , but the colonel in command commended him for knocking out an anti-tank gun . <p> Richardson spent about five months in Burma with an elite force of volunteers led by Maj. Gen. Frank Merrill , known as Merrill 's Marauders . They operated behind Japanese lines carrying out ambushes and otherwise harassing enemy forces . <p> Periodically , while the Marauders regrouped in remote , safe areas , Richardson would send out his stories in light planes supporting the unit . A few times he flew back to Army headquarters briefly to do his writing . <p> When he covered the Allied siege of the Burmese city of Bahmo , he discovered that advances were being falsely claimed . <p> " " What happened , " he said , " " was that the Chinese lied in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was exaggerated at every point . " <p> To the chagrin of public relations officers , he said , the Army called a news conference " " to take back everything that had been reported as taken in the last three weeks . " <p> Richardson probably became the war 's most decorated soldier correspondent . In addition to earning seven battle stars , he received the Legion of Merit from MacArthur for boosting morale ; the Bronze Star , Combat Infantryman 's Badge and a Chinese decoration for his Merrill 's Marauders duty ; and one of the 12 National Headliners Club Valor Medals awarded war correspondents . Although Richardson directly participated in combat operations , he wrote none of his dispatches in the first person . <p> " " When a guy is living with people who are fighting and dying , he wants them to be in the foreground , not him , " he said . <p> " " That 's what I think every correspondent should remember . It 's not who I am . It 's who they are . " <p> TYPE : @
