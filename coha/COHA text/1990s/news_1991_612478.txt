<p> This much Livia Greeson remembers : She said goodbye to her father , Jozsef Ungar , as he left their home in Hungary in June 1944 . He was going to fight the Nazis . <p> " Be good and listen to your mother , " he told her , as they hugged and kissed . <p> She was 14 then , a Jewish girl who enjoyed long walks , Clark Gable movies and Friday night meals of roasted beef and Tokay wine . <p> A few months later , she and her mother , Etel , were sent to Auschwitz , then Bergen Belsen concentration camps , where they watched camp prisoners kill themselves by embracing electric fences . She slept on a concrete floor where lice fed on victims who slowly starved to death . <p> On April 11 , 1945 , Livia Greeson slumped against a barrack wall , helpless , and watched her mother die . <p> More than ever , she thought of her father , that someday she would go home and he would be there waiting . She would curl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little girl . <p> Documents on 400,000 WWII victims <p> But Livia Greeson never saw her father again . <p> " I just want to know what happened to him and where , and that he did n't suffer like the others , " says Ms. Greeson , now 61 and living in Jonesboro . <p> Because of an American and International Red Cross effort , Ms. Greeson may finally find out . <p> Two years ago , the Soviet Union released documents relating to 400,000 World War II victims . In the past year , the Holocaust and War Victims Tracing and Information Center has accepted 5,000 inquiries about lost loved ones , says Linda Klein , spokeswoman for the center 's national office in Baltimore . <p> People who suffered through the Holocaust , such as Ms. Greeson , have waited decades for the kind of simple details the documents provide , information about how , where and when relatives died - or indications that a relative might be alive . Knowing the details of a loved one 's death is especially important to the Jewish custom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . <p> Few responses so far <p> In metropolitan Atlanta , 26 requests for information from the Soviet documents have been filed . There has been one response . <p> But a leader of a local Holocaust survivors support group says the Red Cross service has surfaced too late . " A lot of our survivors are n't here anymore , " says Benjamin Hirsch , president of Hemshech , an organization with 200 members . <p> Still , many metro residents wait for word , any word . <p> Jerry Aronson , 56 , of Marietta , fled Berlin with his family at age 2 in 1937 . A well-to-do uncle financed their escape on a fishing boat to Sweden , then a liner to America . <p> The uncle stayed behind . Now , Mr. Aronson wants to know which concentration camps the uncle and his family ended up in . And how they died there . <p> " That 's essentially where I would have ended up myself , " Mr. Aronson says . <p> Lost her sisters to bad timing <p> Not all the requests are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent away to concentration camps . <p> As Russian troops stormed Germany , Maria Neudamm McAlhany , now 64 and living in Fairburn , fled her hometown of Elbing , Germany , on a night when the wind blew bitter and the snow piled knee-deep . <p> Her two sisters were out of the house when Mrs. McAlhany and her mother were told to pack their belongings on a sled and leave . So they left a note to meet in Berlin . <p> At a mobbed Elbing train station , Ms. McAlhany and her mother climbed aboard as strangers lifted them through a window . They lived on potato peels and stayed warm by eating bread dipped in cognac . Days later , her mother died of pneumonia . <p> Mrs. McAlhany never saw her sisters again . <p> " Maybe they got married and they 're alive , " she says . " That 's all I can hope for . " <p> Scars - and ID tattoo - remain <p> Decades have passed . But for Ms. Greeson , the Holocaust 's scars run far deeper than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A- 23666 , " it says . <p> Her father would be 94 today . <p> The very thought of seeing him again sends tears streaming down Ms. Greeson 's face . She would tell him how much she loves him . She 'd give back the hugs and kisses he left so long ago . <p> " That 's a big dream , I tell you , " she says . <p> She wipes her eyes , then shuts them so tightly . <p> " But I can still dream , I guess . " About the process <p> Of the documents gathered on 400,000 war victims when Soviet troops liberated concentration camps in Europe , 70,000 were death certificates . The documents were sealed by the Soviet Union until two years ago . <p> The International Red Cross has copied the information on microfilm and stored it at the International Tracing Service in Arolsen , Germany , which receives requests from the United States through its office in Baltimore . <p> 500 workers at the center translate requests into German in their effort to match information . Among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name Schwartz , and many street addresses that no longer exist . <p> Those seeking information should not expect a reply for at least a year . <p> In the United States , 5,000 inquiries have been filed . So far , 53 responses have been provided . Of those , only half provided information about missing relatives and other loved ones . <p> The information usually will provide a date and place of death . The cause of death is less certain , as Nazis typically wrote " heart failure " or some other vague explanation . <p> Whom to call <p> The Red Cross Holocaust and War Victims Tracing and Information Center in Atlanta , 881-9800 ext. 333 , or 1 ( 800 ) 848-9277 . <p> Jane Leavey at the Zachor Holocaust Center of the Atlanta Jewish Federation , 873-1661 . <p> Benjamin Hirsch at Hemshech , an organization of Holocaust survivors , 325-3001 . <p> Source : The American Red Cross , staff research .
