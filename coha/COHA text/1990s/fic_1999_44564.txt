WHEN GRUNJAK , LORD OF the Blighted Barrens , sent his first appeal for relief from a spell that had left him covered from head to foot with boils , Kedrigern read it with delight . " Could n't happen to a more deserving man , " he said . <p> Princess , who considered her husband to be a reasonably compassionate wizard , was surprised but withheld comment even when a second appeal left Kedrigern unmoved . " They 'll improve his appearance , " he said upon reading it , chuckling with malicious satisfaction . <p> This time she could not remain silent . " A fellow human being is suffering under a terrible spell . You owe it to the poor man to despell him . " <p> " No one owes Grunjak anything , my dear , " he replied , adding after a moment 's thought , " Except perhaps a good thrashing . " <p> " What has the man done ? " <p> Kedrigem sat back in his comfortable chair , made a little tent of his fingertips , and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacks the temerity to injure a wizard . But to others .. it would be easier to tell you what he has n't done . Grunjak of the Blighted Barrens is known among those unfortunate enough to be his neighbors as Grunjak the Gross , the Greasy , the Grisly , the Grim , the Grungy , the Greedy , the Gruesome , and the Grotty , as well as numerous non-alliterative epithets I would not repeat in the presence of a lady . To describe him as a malevolent , vicious , brutal dolt , liar , coward , bully , and thief would be shameless flattery . A curse of boils is mild recompense for his misdeeds , and I see no reason to interfere with the course of justice . " <p> Princess could read his moods . She said no more , but waited . <p> Grunjak 's third appeal opened with the promise of a complete reformation . He swore by every saint that once cured , he would forsake barbarity and brutality , empty his dungeons and his coffers , abandon looting and lechery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He would repent , he would make good , he would be a new and better man . Kedrigem paused in his reading to observe , " An easy promise to make . A new Grunjak could hardly be a worse one . " <p> Princess was not of the same mind . " You ca n't shrug this off , " she said . " The reformation of such an appalling man would be a great service to humanity . It has to be done , and no one else is even trying . " <p> The latter observation was not quite true . Zealous clergy had made several attempts to bring the light to Grunjak , but every monk who set foot on his land had been so severely battered that he was incapable of anything but silent prayer for months afterward . The neighboring landowners were aware of Grunjak 's ways , but tolerant . " There he goes again , " they would say at word of each new atrocity . " Grunjak will be Grunjak . " No punitive expedition was ever mounted against him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never occurred to anyone . Grunjak was , after all , one of them . Besides , his kingdom was poor and his treasury , despite his rapacity , was trifling ; there was nothing to be gained by such an action but the satisfaction of doing right , an inducement easily resisted by the local nobility . <p> Kedrigern looked up from the letter . " I do n't want to try , either . Let him suffer . He deserves it . " <p> " You must help him . It 's your professional duty , " Princess said . <p> " He 's a thoroughly rotten , ugly , nasty man . " <p> " You ca n't expect all your clients to be beautiful unfortunate princesses . " <p> " And why not ? " <p> " Do n't be difficult . You 're not required to admire your clients , only to help them . " <p> " I prefer to let Grunjak help himself . He should be good at it - he 's been helping himself to other people 's property for thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride from here in a particularly nasty stretch of country . You know how I feel about travel . " <p> " We all have to make sacrifices now and then , " she said . " If you despell him , he 'll reform . He promised . " <p> " Grunjak is a notorious liar . " <p> " Give him the benefit of the doubt . You owe it to society . " <p> Kedrigem muttered something indistinct but unenthusiastic about society 's claim on him , settled deeper into the cushions , and read on in silence , frowning . When he came to the end of the letter , he arose , tucked the missive into his tunic , and announced , " Grunjak is receiving his just desserts . But if it will make you happy , my dear ... " <p> " It will . " <p> " Then I 'll go . " <p> " That 's very sweet of you , " she said . <p> " Your happiness is my pleasure . " He took her hand and raised it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wording of the postscript initialed with an unsteady G : A fee of five crowns will be paid immediately upon cure . <p> Kedrigern left the next morning , alone , astride his great red-eyed , silver-horned steed , an enchanted creature black as midnight , massive as an ox , and intimidating as a crouching panther . Intimidation seemed to him a wise policy when dealing with the likes of Grunjak . <p> He arrived late on the morning of his third day of travel . The trip was completed without incident , delay , or pleasure . Grunjak 's ugly hulk of a castle , Ma Grossierte , rose from a low mound at the center of a desolate and windswept wasteland . Under a sky the color of ashes , flat soggy fields extended to the horizon , bare and lifeless save for a few feeble trees . <p> A trio of rancid-smelling brutes bade the wizard a sullen welcome and conducted him directly to their lord 's chambers , where Grunjak awaited him in a slipper bath . Only Grunjak 's head was visible , made even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of blazing red spots each the size of a thumbnail . <p> Grunjak dismissed the guards . As soon as he and Kedrigem were alone , he moaned , " Help me , wizard ! " <p> " That 's why I 'm here , Grunjak , ' said Kedrigem . " But first , I want your solemn word that you 'll abandon your wicked ways if I despell you . " <p> " Oh , I will , I will , I swear it . I 've learned a bitter lesson , and I 'll never forget it . May I suffer horrible torments if I go back on my word ! " <p> " You will . Are the boils everywhere ? " <p> Grunjak groaned . " Even on the palms of my hands and the soles of my feet . " <p> " That 's a very thorough curse . Who placed it ? " <p> " A nasty hateful old farmer . We had just finished driving off his livestock and loading up his grain , and were giving his serfs and children and grandchildren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put a curse on me . Me , his lord and master ! We had n't laid a finger on the old scoundrel . Had n't even burned down his barn . There 's no gratitude in peasants these days , wizard . No loyalty . No sense of duty . They 're utterly selfish . " <p> " There 's to be no more of that once you 're cured , Grunjak . " <p> " There wo n't be . I had him hanged . " <p> " You miss my point . I mean no more looting and beating and summary executions . " <p> Grunjak gave a start , splashing water in all directions . His eyes widened in pained disbelief . " But that 's what makes me a leader ! " <p> " No , it 's what makes you a monster whom people wish to see covered in boils . I should think you 'd have grasped that fact . You must change your ways completely , Grunjak . You must repent and become a new man . " <p> After a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll change . " <p> " Swear . " <p> " I swear I 'll change . The very minute the boils disappear . " <p> " Very well . Get out of the bath . " <p> Grunjak , dripping wet and naked , bespangled with boils and bedecked with the scars of past battles , was a sight to make even a hardened wizard wince . Averting his eyes , Kedrigem dropped the contents of three small vials into the slipper bath , recited the appropriate spell , and instructed Grunjak to immerse himself once more , completely , and stay under for a slow count of ten . <p> When Grunjak broke the surface , his battered face was free of boils . " They 're gone ! They 're all gone ! " he spluttered . <p> " Of course they 're gone . Did n't you believe I could manage it ? " <p> " I did , I did , I never doubted you for a minute ! You 're a great wizard and I 'll sing your praises everywhere I go . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised . " Your reformation is off to a good start . just remember to stay reformed , or the boils will be back within the hour . And now I 'll take my five crowns and go . " <p> Grunjak rummaged through the clothing that lay in a heap beside the slipper bath and dug out a pouch . He handed it to the wizard . Kedrigem opened it and shook out three golden crowns . He studied them for a moment , then said , " Where 's the rest ? " <p> " You 've got three crowns there . " <p> " Three is not five . " <p> " I ca n't give you any more , wizard . I swear it ! " <p> " Men in my profession do not haggle , Grunjak . Your letter offered five . I accepted . The fee , therefore , is five . " <p> " I 've never had that much in the treasury . " <p> " Then you were very foolish and wicked to have promised it . " <p> " I promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . You knew that I was wicked and deceitful . " <p> " You were also covered with boils - as you will be in a very short time unless I get my five crowns . " <p> " Those three crowns have emptied my treasury and left me penniless ! The only way I could manage five would be to go back to looting and plundering ! You do n't want that , do you ? " <p> " You really should have thought of that earlier , Grunjak . This puts us both in an awkward position . " <p> " I beg you , wizard , do n't do anything in anger ! Take the three crowns as part payment , and we 'll look around the castle and see if there 's anything I can give you to make up the balance . That 's fair , is n't it ? ' <p> Kedrigem hesitated . In truth , five crowns was an enormous fee for a simple despelling ; three was quite adequate . But he had not set the amount ; Grunjak had offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boils is hardly in a state of mind to bargain . He can easily be victimized . Here was an opportunity to be generous in a noble cause . A show of good will at the outset might do much to encourage Grunjak 's reformation . <p> " Very well , Grunjak . Dry yourself off and get dressed . I 'm sure we can find something . " <p> For a time , it seemed likely that they would not . Grunjak 's was a poor land ; his taste was execrable and his booty was scanty and in very poor condition : dented cooking pots , cracked dishes , dirty old clothes , bent and rusty weapons and farm implements , unsteady tables and uncomfortable chairs . Most of it looked to have been taken not for any intrinsic value , but merely for the pleasure of looting . <p> As they picked through Grunjak 's meager treasury , Kedrigem 's hopes waned . His thoughts turned to the futility of worldly greed . In a lifetime of remorseless looting and plundering , Grunjak had accumulated a midden of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tenth of a crown . <p> Grunjak 's gravelly voice broke into his musings . " How about a carpet ? A wizard can always use a nice carpet . I bought this one from a knight - " <p> " You bought it ? Paid for it ? " Kedrigem asked , startled . <p> Drawing himself up indignantly , Grunjak said , " Of course I paid for it . I never took advantage of my peers , only the weak and defenseless . It was so much easier . But that 's all behind me now . " <p> " Good . About the carpet .... " <p> " This knight had picked it up somewhere in the East . He said it was very valuable , but I had problems with it , so I used it to plug a hole in the wall , " he said , pointing to the wall where what appeared to be a wad of rags was stuffed into a hole , held in place by a board nailed over it . <p> Kedrigem went to the carpet and laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic . It was so faint as to be almost imperceptible , but it was unmistakably present . <p> " What sort of problems did you have ? " he asked . <p> " Oh , nothing serious . Nothing that would trouble a wizard . It used to move around , that 's all . " <p> " Move around ? " <p> " Every night I 'd set it by the door , and every morning I 'd find it lying in front of the fireplace . The wind blew it about . This castle gets pretty breezy in winter . " <p> " Let 's have a look at that carpet . " <p> Grunjak jerked the board free with one violent yank , pulled out the carpet , and spread it on the treasury floor . It was dirty and rumpled , but the colors had held up well , and the design was quite attractive . <p> " That would go for three crowns in any market I know , " Grunjak said with the air of a connoisseur . <p> " Not without a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tassels . " <p> " Who notices tassels ? " <p> " I do . And what about those holes ? " <p> " I tried nailing it down , but it kept moving around anyway . Even if you knock off a crown for the holes , it 's still worth two . " <p> Kedrigern was silent , calculating . The carpet definitely possessed some kind of magic . It was prudent to make sure that magical objects were in the proper hands , and there were no hands more proper than a wizard 's . If the magic were benevolent , it would be put to good use ; if it proved nasty , the thing could be despelled and cleaned up . And if the magic were exhausted , or nearly so , this carpet would fit nicely in the great room before the hearth . <p> " Done , Grunjak , " he announced . <p> By early afternoon he was on his way , the carpet rolled up and tied behind him . His horse showed interest , but no discomfort . Kedrigern took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at ease with one another . <p> He arrived home in the early afternoon of a clear bright day . With the assistance of his house-troll he unrolled the carpet on the lawn before the cottage for a close inspection . Experience had taught him that it was wise to determine the exact properties of magic objects before introducing them into his household . <p> Princess flew out to greet him with a kiss and a fond embrace . At sight of the carpet she gave him a puzzled look . " Wherever did you get that ? " she asked . <p> " Part of my fee . It has some kind of magic . " <p> " What kind ? " <p> " I do n't know yet . " <p> Shecircledit once , slowly , examining it from a safe distance . " It certainly is n't self-cleaning magic . Or look-your-best magic . The thing 's a mess . " <p> " Everything in Grunjak 's castle is a mess . This is just a bit worse than most . It was stuffed into a hole in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the tassels ? A carpet looks so pathetic without proper tassels , " Princess said . <p> The carpet had apparently once possessed an impressive tassel of gold and silver threads at each comer , but only vestiges of these splendid adornments remained . Two had been badly burned , another neatly sheared off , and of the fourth only a few strands survived . <p> " It 's all ripped and bitten , too , " said Princess with a shudder of distaste . " Grunjak 's palace must be overrun with rats . " <p> " It is , but they did n't make the holes . Those are nail holes . Grunjak nailed it down . He said it used to move around . " <p> " Maybe it 's a scatter rug . " <p> Kedrigern drew out his medallion . He raised it to his eye and studied the carpet through the small hole at its center . Princess waited patiently for a time , and finally asked , " Do you see anything ? " <p> " It 's definitely magical . The magic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the Aperture of True Vision . " He tucked away the medallion , rubbed his eye , then folded his arms and looked down on the carpet , speculating . <p> Princess tapped his shoulder . " Have you had lunch ? " <p> " Only a bit of bread and an apple along the way . " <p> " Before you get too deeply absorbed in this carpet , you ought to have lunch , " she said . " I 'll just fly in and have Spot prepare something . " <p> " Of course ! That 's it , my dear ! " <p> " There , you see ? You were hungrier than you thought . " <p> " No , no , no , I mean flight ! Flying ! This is a flying carpet ! " <p> She looked at the carpet , then at him , then back at the carpet . " It 's not flying anywhere now , " she said . <p> " It 's very low on magic . Mistreatment and neglect will do that sometimes . Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why it kept moving around Grunjak 's castle . " <p> " From what you said of Grunjak , I should think a flying carpet would fly away from him as soon as possible . " <p> " It was n't free to fly off . He acquired it legally , actually paid for it , so the carpet was his . " <p> Princess 's interest was stirred . " If this is really a flying carpet it would be a great convenience . It would have to be cleaned and patched up before I 'd be seen on it , but just think of the time and trouble it would save us . You might even change your attitude about travel if you could just sit on a carpet and go . " <p> " 1 might indeed . Yes , it would be convenient . And comfortable . Plenty of room to stretch out . " <p> " There 's even room for guests . " <p> " And space for luggage . It has definite possibilities . " <p> " Before we explore them further , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and drawing him inside . <p> They enjoyed an unhurried meal , he describing the journey and the sights along the way , embellishing freely since it had been fairly dull and uneventful overall , she filling him in on her progress in spelling . Conversation soon turned to the possibilities of their new acquisition . They knew of no spells for cleaning , patching holes , and restoring tassels ; but Spot had become quite accomplished at household chores , and they felt secure entrusting the problem to him , provided he was carefully instructed and closely supervised . <p> After a second mug of cider , they strolled out to examine the carpet 's magical properties in more detail . To their surprise , it was gone . <p> " Could it have blown away ? " Princess asked . <p> " There 's no wind at all . Hardly a breeze . " <p> " Flown away ? " <p> " That usually requires a verbal command . " <p> " Do you think Spot might have eaten it ? " <p> " I heard him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Then where- " <p> " There ! " Kedrigem cried , pointing to the lawn beneath the pair of great oaks that stood near the cottage . <p> They hurried to where the carpet lay tidily spread out in the shade . Neither of them spoke . They were too puzzled even to speculate on how it had changed locations . <p> " This is fascinating , " said Kedrigem . " It could n't have blown here , no one gave it a command and no one moved it .... I wonder .... " He cleared his throat and in his most commanding voice said , " Carpet , if you have the power to speak , speak to me ! " <p> The carpet did not utter a word . <p> " I 've never heard of a talking carpet . Not even a magic one , " said Princess . <p> " Neither have I , but it does n't hurt to try . " Kedrigern thought for a time , then said , " If you have a means of communicating , carpet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first ; then , after a tense interval , the threads of the sole surviving tassel gave a single feeble twitch . <p> " It 's trying to express itself , " Kedrigem whispered . <p> " It does n't seem to have much to say , " Princess replied . <p> " Well , if you 'd been stuffed in a hole in the wall for heaven only knows how many years and lost your tassels-look ! It 's twitching again ! " <p> " It ca n't tell us much by twitching . " <p> But the frayed and enfeebled tassel was clearly limbering up . After a few more tentative twitches , it curled itself around a twig and began to make scratching motions in the soil . Kedrigem rushed into the cottage , emerging moments later with a pen , an inkwell , and a sheet of parchment . He laid the pen close by the tassel . <p> At once the emaciated tassel tossed the twig aside and coiled about the pen . The wizard then placed the remaining writing implements in easy reach , stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ? " <p> The carpet dipped the pen in the inkwell , shook off a few excess drops , and wrote in shaky script , Yes , Master . Sorry . <p> " Why ? " <p> I feared I would fade in the sunlight , causing disappointment to my benevolent Master . Ordinarily I do not act unbidden , but <p> " No need to apologize , " Kedrigern broke in . " It was thoughtless of me to put you there . " <p> Oh , no , no , Master , you must not blame yourself . It was sheer audacity on my part , the carpet scribbled . <p> " Nothing of the sort . You 're a flying carpet , and you flew . That 's nothing to apologize for . " <p> But I flew without your leave , Master . Without your command , I drew upon already much depleted reserves of magic that should have been dedicated entirely to your service . I did a shameless selfish thing . <p> I deserve unraveling . <p> " Ah . I begin to comprehend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in places where you might get burned , or faded , or tom , and you kept moving away . It was pure self-preservation . " <p> Precisely so , Master . <p> " And moving without a command draws on your reserves of magic . " <p> It practically drains them , Master . <p> " Well , you need n't worry about such treatment here , Carpet . Do you have a name ? " <p> Kurdestan is my name . My beloved master and beautiful mistress may call me " Stan " if they so choose . <p> " All right , Stan . First thing we 'll do is give you a good cleaning and air you out . No beating , I promise you . We 'll take you for a spin every now and then , but we wo n't nail you to the floor or stuff you in holes . " <p> The carpet , which had risen several inches off the ground at Kedrigem 's promise of better treatment , sank at the mention of flying . Its descent was accompanied by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word Alas . <p> " Why ' Alas , ' Stan ? Do n't you enjoy flying ? " <p> Oh , wise and kindly master , I loathe flying . I wish only a proper place on a decent , solid , honest wooden floor . <p> " But people would walk on you , " said Princess . <p> Yes ! Yes ! wrote the carpet in huge exuberant letters . <p> " Do you mean to say you like the idea of having people walk all over you , and put tables and chairs on you ? " <p> Oh , yes , most kindly and perceptive lady ! Even spills would not be taken amiss . That is the way of the carpet . The tassel paused , then with a flourish wrote , Some were born to fly ; some achieve flight ; some , like me , have flight thrust upon them . <p> " Do n't get dramatic , Stan , " Kedrigern said . <p> Princess regarded the carpet with bewilderment . " I do n't understand how you can complain . Flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gossamer wings , it may be so . But carpets are carpets . They were not meant to fly about the world , they were meant to lie on floors . If carpets were meant to fly , we would have been given wings . <p> " You 've been given magic . That 's even better , " said Princess . When the carpet made no response , she demanded , " Well , is n't it ? " <p> After a thoughtful interval , the carpet wrote , For birds and insects , flying is a way of life . For people , it is a pleasing diversion . For carpets , it is a painful ordeal . The cold and dampness of the upper air loosen our knots and accelerate fading . Over time there is serious shrinkage . <p> Princess bit her lip and looked chagrined . The possession of a flying carpet delighted her , and she hated to relinquish the convenience it afforded . But she was too tender-hearted to force her household furnishings to fly against their will . <p> Kedrigern said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a flying carpet , Stan ? " <p> I had no choice in the matter , wise and benevolent Master . I was one of a large family . My brothers and sisters went to decorate the palaces of sultans . was bought by a sorcerer , enchanted , and sold to an emir who made use of me to spy on his neighbors . He was blown off by a high wind one stormy night , and I flew on , masterless , without goal or purpose , until I became soaked with rain and was forced down near an encampment of nomads . They took me in and treated me with kindness . For a long time I fulfilled the true purpose of my kind , though I lay on sand rather than a proper floor . Then I was seized by an avaricious emir . Since that evil day , I have passed through many hands and suffered great indignities and unspeakable cruelties . I was sold to a Frankish knight who brought me home to his castle . He beat me regularly and at last sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " There 'll be no more cruelty , we promise , " said Princess gently . " But we really would like you to fly from time to time . I do my own flying , but my husband has to travel on horseback , and a long journey can be so fatiguing . " <p> I shall serve you loyally , the carpet wrote . But its tassel drooped and the pen moved sluggishly . <p> " Well , let 's give it a try , " said Kedrigern , settling himself cross-legged on the carpet . " Go , Stan ! " <p> Urged on with such 6lan , the carpet shot forward like a bolt from a crossbow . Kedrigern tumbled heels over head and rolled off the rear and onto the grass . " Come back here ! " he howled . <p> The carpet , well off in the distance by now , did a tight turn and circled back to the foot of the oak tree , where it stopped abruptly at Kedrigem 's side and floated gently to the ground . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once again , keeping well forward . " This time , control your exuberance , " he said . " Go slowly . Once around the house and yard , and do n't get more than a foot off the ground . " <p> The carpet rose and moved forward at a dignified pace , slightly faster than a walk . It accelerated as it proceeded along the tree line , picked up more speed as it swung around the cottage and the outbuildings , and was moving at a good clip as it made its last turn and headed across the yard toward the oaks . <p> The door yard was enclosed by a very sturdy two-rail fence . The lower rail was just a bit more than a foot off the ground . The top rail was about head-high to a man seated on a flying carpet . They were headed for the fence at alarming speed . <p> Kedrigem had been enjoying the trip . His attention was on the exhilarating sensation of flight , not the fence , and only a warning shout from Princess , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the danger . <p> " Stop ! " he cried . <p> The carpet stopped at the instant of command . Kedrigem did not . He continued his forward progress at a speed only slightly diminished , inserting himself neatly between the rails , skimming along the grass on his face , and coming to a stop not far from his starting point . <p> The carpet sank close to the ground and began to back off slowly . Kedrigem climbed to his feet , shook his head , felt his limbs , and brushed himself off . He looked around . His expression was grim . Catching sight of the carpet trying its best to ease unobtrusively around the corner of the house , he pointed and cried , " You ! Assassin ! Get back here at once , do you hear ? " <p> So low now that it brushed the grass in its passing , the carpet moved slowly toward him and stopped at his feet . It did not settle , but remained just a hair off the ground , trembling slightly . Kedrigern looked down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severely . He said nothing . Princess fluttered to his side and placed a hand on his arm . Still he said nothing . <p> " We promised no cruelty , " she said . <p> " You promised . I said nothing of the sort . " <p> " Yes , you did . You promised no beating . " i <p> Kedrigem gave an exasperated sigh . The carpet edged a bit closer and , dipping a comer , attempted to dust off his boot . <p> " There , " said Princess . " It 's sorry . " <p> " So am I. I should have left it to plug the wall in Grunjak 's castle . " <p> " Do n't frighten it . " <p> " I do n't mean to be cruel , my dear , but this carpet is not cooperating . It represents a large portion of my fee , and I see no way that I 'll ever get to put it to proper use . " <p> " With a little cleaning and patching it would look nice in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be happy there , too . " <p> " I suppose so . But if all I wanted was a carpet for the great room , I need n't have gone all the way to Grunjak 's for it . " <p> " Surely you would n't want an ordinary carpet on your floor You 're a wizard . You have standards to maintain . " <p> " I also have my life to preserve . This thing would have knocked my brains out against the fence rail . " <p> " Do n't blame the carpet . It was doing what it 's supposed to do . " <p> " Yes , but it does n't want to do what it 's supposed to do , and I think it 's deliberately creating problems . " Glancing down , he said , " You do n't want to fly me around , do you ? Not me , not anyone . Tell the truth , Stan . " <p> The carpet slunk to where the pen and inkstand stood . Taking up the pen , it wrote . All I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lie on a nicely waxed floor in front of a roaring fire . Not too close . The sparks can be very distressing . <p> " I thought as much , " said Kedrigem . He remained silent for a time , looking thoughtfully down on the carpet , and finally said , " Let 's go inside . Princess will show you where to lie down . And see to it that you stay put . " <p> " What are you going to do ? " Princess asked . <p> " I 'm going to look through my spelling books . There may be a way to work this out to our mutual satisfaction . " <p> It was some months later that a solitary figure dressed in the robes of a pilgrim made his way to the little cottage on Silent Thunder Mountain . Kedrigem was in the door yard , seated amid cushions in his most comfortable chair , meditating in the autumn sunshine . The pilgrim hailed him wearily in a gruff but kindly voice . <p> " Greetings to you , pilgrim , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " May I offer you something ? " <p> " A sip of water . No more . " <p> " How about a crust of bread ? " <p> The pilgrim weighed the offer , then said , " As long as it 's stale . " <p> Kedrigem studied the gaunt , dusty figure for a time , then said , " Have we met ? You look familiar . " <p> " I am that wretch who once was known as Grunjak the Gross , the Greasy , the Grisly , the Grim , the Grungy , the Greedy , the Gruesome , and the Grotty . " <p> " Ah , yes , of course , Grunjak . You 've lost some weight . " <p> " I eat very little these days . I am on pilgrimage to atone for the evil life I once led . I have much atoning to do , but perhaps some day I shall be known as Grunjak the Good . " <p> " The boils have n't returned , have they ? " <p> " No , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Glad to have been of help . Where are you headed ? " <p> " To the shrine at Campostella . After that , to the Holy Land . " <p> " Well , you 're certainly not the old Grunjak . " <p> " I am such a reformed man that I also wish to apologize for attempting to cheat you of your promised fee . " <p> Kedrigem waved his words off . " Do n't give it a thought . As a matter of fact , that carpet you gave me was a magic carpet . " <p> " Indeed ? I am happy to learn of it . Has the carpet been sold at a great and well-deserved profit to yourself ? " <p> " No . The poor thing hated flying . It 's just an ordinary carpet now . It cleaned up very nicely . We 've repaired the nail holes and replaced the tassels . It 's lying in front of the fireplace , if you 'd care to have a look . " <p> " I have forbidden myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is complete , but I thank you for your kind offer . Your words have gladdened my heart , wizard . " <p> " Can I offer you anything more , Grunjak ? A sip of water and a bit of stale bread hardly seems  --  " <p> " No , no , nothing more , " said the pilgrim , waving a sun-browned hand . " I must be on my way . So much to atone for , so little time . Farewell , wizard . " <p> As the dusty figure trudged off down the mountain , Kedrigem looked after him with great satisfaction . Here was proof of a job well done . The Grunjak case , undertaken with such reluctance , had turned out to be one of his great successes . <p> He watched until the pilgrim disappeared around a bend in the road , then he returned to the chair and seated himself once again . " Time to go inside , " he said , with a friendly pat on the chair am . " Once around the grounds , then to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep low going through the doorways , or I 'll take the magic off and give it back to Stan . All right , let 's lift off .
