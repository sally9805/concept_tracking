<p> 1 . HOW STELLA GOT HER GROOVE BACK , by Terry McMillan , Viking , $ 23.95 <p> People who enjoyed McMillan 's 1992 bestseller " Waiting to Exhale " may want to skip this surprisingly uneven follow-up . Gone are the well-drawn characters and storylines from the previous book , the author 's third . Instead , readers get a tensionless tale about a black divorcee in her 40s and her relationship with a Jamaican man half her age . Besides its weak plot ( based on events in the author 's life ) , the novel features one-dimensional characters and often wince-worthy dialogue . By Kim Campbell <p> 2 . THE TENTH INSIGHT , by James Redfield , Warner Books , $ 19.95 <p> Redfield 's sequel to his successful bestseller " Celestine Prophecy , " is also a poorly written , thinly disguised allegory . The book centers around the discovery of a 10th Insight that he says is necessary for " implementing these Insights , living them , ... fulfilling destiny " ( and selling more books ) . Redfield dabbles in spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are glimmers of - forgive the pun - insight , but the whole is a mishmash of religion and new-age thinking . By Yvonne Zipp <p> 3 . MOONLIGHT BECOMES YOU , by Mary Higgins Clark , Simon &; Schuster , $ 24 <p> The latest from Mary Higgins Clark is an eminently readable mystery , with an intelligent voice and an eye for detail . The protagonist is a gutsy photographer who must solve the tragic murder of her stepmother and sudden deaths of two of her stepmother 's friends . Set in Newport , R.I. , the action concerns romance and riches , both hidden and displayed . The ending is a bit predictable but does not detract from a stylish story . By Terri Theiss <p> 4 . MALICE , by Danielle Steel , Delacorte , $ 24.95 <p> The latest novel from the romance author is more polemic than poetic . The story of Grace Adams 's recovery from childhood abuse and an unjust prison stint is clearly intended to sway readers on the subject of domestic violence . It presents a woman who rises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overcome theirs . But the drawn-out writing about her horrors overwhelms the plot , which races almost cursorily through its most interesting twists and turns near the end . By Terri Theiss <p> 5 . THE CELESTINE PROPHECY , by James Redfield , Warner , $ 17.95 <p> Well-intended but poorly written , the plot is a cross between " Indiana Jones " and a self-help book . The hero is on a quest for a recently discovered Peruvian manuscript that details the progress of spirituality at the end of the 20th century . At different stages of the journey , he and his fellow searches discover spiritual " insights , " nine in total . Rather than profound , the book is awash in such cliches such as the need to " become conscious of the coincidences in our lives . " By Yvonne Zipp <p> 6 . PRIMARY COLORS , by Anonymous , Random House , $ 24 <p> Scratch the surface of this novel about Southern governor Jack Stanton 's campaign for president and you 'll find Bill Clinton . And wife , Hillary . And a host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book 's mysterious author ( who denies that the characters and events are real ) . Deducing who 's who and following the ins and outs of primaries make this an interesting read , although not an entirely satisfying one as subplots and lengthiness weigh it down . By Kim Campbell <p> 7 . NEANDERTHAL , by John Darnton , Random House , $ 22.95 <p> Join a group of archaeologists on their search for living Neanderthals . Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist John Darnton paints a convincing portrait of the impossible as the scientists encounter both a good and an evil group of cavemen . The archaeologists ' close shaves and several brutal murders make this an intense , grotesque , and graphically violent story . Strong language and scenes of sexual encounters are scattered throughout the book . By Carolee Aker <p> 8 . STAR WARS : SHADOWS OF THE EMPIRE , by Steve Perry , Bantam , $ 22.95 <p> Sandwiched between the events of " Empire Strikes Back " and " Return of the Jedi , " this latest adventure in the Lucas universe revolves around Princess Leia 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as the evil Prince Xizor 's attempts to capture Luke Skywalker . The author spends too much time trying to convince the reader how much some new characters are like old established ones . The writing does not support that conclusion . It also fails to engage the reader 's interest . By Marianne Le Pelley <p> 9 . THE HORSE WHISPERER , by Nicholas Evans , Delacorte Press , $ 23.95 <p> The storyline is formulaic , cliche laden , and noticeably influenced by " The Bridges of Madison County . " It depicts a strong tight- lipped Montana rancher able to see into the " soul " of horses , and a British-cum-New York successful magazine editor who experiences a midlife crisis when her daughter-on-horseback collides with a semi-truck . The editor finds herself in an extramarital affair with the rancher . Parental guilt about putting career first emotionally tugs throughout this soap opera . By Jim Bencivenga <p> 10 . ABSOLUTE POWER , by David Baldacci , Warner , $ 22.95 <p> When the trophy wife of a DC businessman is murdered after a graphic bout of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her bedroom , and only he knows that the man behind the murder is her lover , the president of the United States . Baldacci starts off with an intriguing plot and interesting characters , but along the way the story bogs down . In the end , the resolution is predictable and the characters become cliched . <p> By Marianne Le Pelley <p> 11 . TIMEPIECE , by Richard Paul Evans , Simon &; Schuster , $ 18 <p> Tick tock , tick tock . This piece is about time and overcoming the memory of loss ; were it more about eternity ! A magnificent grandfather clock in the Parkin mansion ticks off hours in human terms : self-sacrifice , suffering , even thoughts of vengeance . It is a prequel to Evans 's , " The Christmas Box , " where the tragic death of a child shaped events . A bequest of love , however - an exquisite rose-gold wristwatch - inspires and transforms the years of this family , making moments stand still . By Mari Murray <p> 12 . I WAS AMELIA EARHART , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author has composeed this novel as a sequence of short , sparely written , almost visionary passages . Third-person descriptions of Earhart and Fred Noonan ( her hapless navigatior ) alternate with first-person accounts in Earhart 's voice . They reflect the thoughts , memories , emotions , and longings that propelled this woman into a life of flight . The writing throughout is terse , austerely lyrical , and the emphasis is on the subjective and psychologocial . It is a paean to the ultimate escape . By Merle Rubin <p> 13 . ROSE , by Martin Cruz Smith , Random House , $ 25.95 <p> Do n't let the pretty title fool you . Through the actions of the main character , Blair , we meet the underside of life head on . Martin Cruz Smith maintains his position as a great storyteller . Twisting undercurrents of manipulation and greed wend their way through the plot and the characters . There is more to this grim , 19th-century coal village of Wigan . Intriguing , well-drawn characters fill out this mystery . When finished , readers will feel as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . By Janet Moller <p> 14 . FIRST KING OF SHANNARA , by Terry Brooks , Del Rey , $ 23.50 <p> In this typical plot of good versus evil , numerous unusual characters with supernatural abilities confront one another in a power struggle . Overly descriptive passages tend to weigh down the plot , but unexpected twists throughout heighten interest . Readers who enjoy fantasy adventures will find this an intriguing story , though not too profound . Themes such as the search for identity , nonconformity , and how power corrupts are traced throughout . A number of scenes are violent . By Carolee Aker <p> 15 . HER OWN RULES , by Barbara Taylor Bradford , Harper Collins , $ 24 <p> Her lost childhood and lost memories haunt hotelier Meredith Stratton as she comes to terms with a past she can barely remember . A vintage romance novel , its slightly melodramatic world is , of course , inhabited only by the beautiful and graceful , and the ending is completely happy . One ca n't help cheering the heorine on as she presses toward self-awareness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likable for their encouragement . This is one for the beach . By Terri Theiss <p> MONITOR 'S PICK <p> For more than a century , African-Americans headed north seeking opportunity - pushed by poverty , segregation , and discrimination back home . But in the last two decades , some half-million black Americans have reversed the trek , moving to the South . <p> What brings them back is a complex web of yearnings and necessities , argues Carol Stack in " Call to Home : African Americans Reclaim the Rural South . " <p> Stack has a novelist 's gift for evoking a time and place and drawing her characters . She knows when to let them speak for themselves at length to tell their stories . She also does n't succumb to the oversimplification that African-Americans , feeling the social-services system in the North has failed them , are returning home only to make use of a superior support system - the family . <p> Part of the answer lies in escaping from the mean streets of urban life . Stack , a veteran ethnographer , spent years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rural areas of North and South Carolina - mostly from big cities like New York , Philadelphia , and Washington , D.C. Sometimes children are sent South to live with grandparents or other relatives while parents keep their city jobs sending money and visiting when they can . <p> Through these stories we gain some understanding of what can drive families apart and what brings them together - and why , despite hardships , black Americans are returning in such numbers to their childhood homes in the rural South .
