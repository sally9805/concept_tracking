A rare short story by an important novelist <p> Every place that I could name you , in the whole world around us , has better things about it than Argus . I just happened to grow up there for eighteen years and the soil got to be part of me , the air has something in it that I breathed . Argus water , fluoridated by an order of the state , does n't taste as good as water in the cities . Still , the first thing I do , walking back into my mother 's house , is stand at the kitchen sink and toss down glass after glass . " Are you filled up ? " My mother stands behind me . " Sit down if you are " She 's tall and broad square with long arms and big knuckles . Her face is rawboned , fierce , and almost masculine in its edges and planes . Several months ago , a beauty operator convinced her that she should feminize her look with curls . Now the permanent , grown out in grizzled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't look like her . Not just the hair , hers is salt and pepper , mine is a reddish brown , but my build . I 'm short , boxy , more like my Aunt Mary , although there 's not much about me that corresponds even to her , except it 's true that I ca n't seem to shake this town . I keep coming back here . " There 's jobs at the beet plant " This rumor , probably false as the plant is in a slump , drops into the dim close air of the kitchen . We have the shades drawn because it 's a hot June , over a hundred degrees , and we 're trying to stay cool . Outside , the water has been sucked from everything . The veins in the leaves are hollow , the ditch grass is crackling . The sky has absorbed every drop . It 's a thin whitish blue veil stretched from end to end over us , a flat gauze tarp . From the depot , I 've walked here beneath it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're in an oven , a big messy one . For a week , it 's been too hot to move much or even clean , and the crops are stunted , failing . The farmer next to us just sold his field for a subdivision , but the workers are n't doing much . They 're wearing wet rags on their heads , sitting near the house sites in the brilliance of noon . The studs of woods stand uselessly upright over them . Nothing casts a shadow . The sun has dried them up too . " The beet plant , my mother says again . Maybe so , " I say , and then , because I 've got something bigger on my mind , " maybe I 'll go out there and apply " " Oh ? " She is intrigued now . " God , this is terrible ! " I take the glass of water in my hand and tip some on my head . I do n't feel cooler though I just feel the steam rising off me . " The fan broke down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kaput now . The motors or something . If Mary would get the dam tax refund we 'd run out to Pamida , buy a couple more , set up a breeze . Then we 'd be cool out here " " Your garden must be dead " I say , lifting the edge of the pull shade . " It 's sick , but I watered . And I wo n't mulch , that draws the slugs " " Nothing could live out there , no bug . " My eyes smart from even looking at the yard , cleared on the north , almost incandescent . " You 'd be surprised . " I wish I could blurt it out , just tell her . Even now , the words swell in my mouth , the one sentence , but I 'm scared and with good reason . There is this about my mother : it is awful to see her angry . Her lips press together and she stiffens herself within , growing wooden , silent . Her features become fixed and remote , she will not speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does you are held in suspense . Nothing that she ever says , in the end , is as bad as that feeling of dread . So I wait , half believing that she 'll figure out my secret for herself , or drag it out of me , not that she ever tries . If I 'm silent , she hardly notices . She 's not like Aunt Mary , who forces me to say more than I know is on my mind . My mother sighs , " It 's too hot to bake . It 's too hot to cook . But it 's too hot to eat , anyway " She 's talking to herself , which makes me reckless . Perhaps she is so preoccupied by the heat that I can slip my announcement past her . I should just say it , but I lose nerve , make an introduction that alerts her . " I have something to tell you . " I 've cast my lot , there 's no going back unless I think quickly . My thoughts hum . But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ice , " I say , " we have to have ice " I speak intensely , leaning toward her , almost glaring , but she is not fooled . " Do n't make me laugh " she says , " there 's not a cube in town . The refrigerators ca n't keep cold enough " She eyes me as if Pm an animal about to pop from its den and run . " Okay . " I break down . " I really do have something " I stand , turn my back . In this lightless warmth I 'm dizzy , almost sick . Now I 've gotten to her and she 's frightened to hear , breathless . " Tell me " she urges . " Go on , get it over with " And so I say it . " I got married " There is a surge of relief , as if a wind blows through the room , but then it 's gone . The curtain flaps and we 're caught again , stunned in an even denser heat . It 's now my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right across from her . But I ca n't bear the picture she makes , the shock that parts her lips , the stunned shade of hurt in her eyes . I have to convince her , somehow , that it 's all right . " You hate weddings ! Just think , just picture it . Me , white net . On a day like this . You , stuffed in your summer wool , and Aunt Mary , God knows . . . and the tux , the rental , the groom . . " Her head lowered as my words fell on her , but now her forehead tips up and her eyes come into view , already hardening . My tongue flies back into my mouth . She mimics , making it a question , She groom ... " I 'm caught , my lips half open , a stuttering noise in my throat . How to begin ? I have rehearsed this but my lines melt away , my opening , my casual introductions . I can think of nothing that would , even in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is no picture adequate , no representation that captures him . So I just put my hand across the table and I touch her hand . " Mother , " I say , like we 're in a staged drama , " he 'll arrive here shortly " There is something forming in her , some reaction . I am afraid to let it take complete shape . " Let 's go out and wait on the steps Mom . Then you 'll see him . " " I do not understand , " she says in a frighteningly neutral voice . This is what I mean . Everything is suddenly forced , as though we 're reading lines . " He 'll approach from a distance " I ca n't help speaking like a bad actor . " I told him to give me an hour . He 'll wait , then he 'll come walking down the road " We rise and unstick our blouses from our stomachs , our skirts from the backs of our legs . Then we walk out front in single file , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A scrubby box elder tree on one side casts a light shade , and the dusty lilacs seem to catch a little breeze on the other . It 's not so bad out here , still hot , but not so dim , contained . It 's worse past the trees . The heat shimmers in a band , rising off the fields , out of the spars and bones of houses which will wreck our view . The horizon and the edge of town show through the spacing now , and as we sit we watch the workers move , slowly , almost in a practiced recital , back and forth . Their headdoths hang to their shoulders , their hard hats are dabs of yellow , their white T-shirts blend into the fierce air and sky . They do n't seem to be doing anything , although we hear faint thuds from their hammers . Otherwise , except for the whistles of a few birds , there is silence . We certainly do n't speak . It is a longer wait than I anticipated , maybe because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creep out , hard , hot , charred , and the heat begins to lengthen and settle . We are going into the worst of the afternoon , when a dot at the end of the road begins to form . Mom and I are both watching . We have not moved our eyes around much , and we blink and squint to try and focus . The dot does n't change , not for a long while . And then it suddenly springs clear in relief , a silhouette , lost a moment in the shimmer , reappearing . In that shining expanse he is a little wedge of moving shade . He continues , growing imperceptibly , until there are variations in the outline , and it can be seen that he is large . As he passes the construction workers , they turn and stop , all alike in their hats , stock-still . Growing larger yet , as if he has absorbed their stares , he nears us . Now we can see the details . He is dark , the first thing . I have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same tribe as she . His arms are thick , his chest is huge , and the features of his face are wide and open . He carries nothing in his hand . He wears a black T-shirt , the opposite of the construction workers , and soft jogging shoes . His jeans are held under his stomach by a belt with a star beaded on the buckle . His hair is long , in a tail . I am the wrong woman for him . I am paler , shorter , unmagnificent . But I stand up . Mom joins me , and I answer proudly when she asks , " His name ? " " His name is Gerry " We descend one step , and stop again . It is here we will receive him . Our hands are folded at our waists . We 're balanced , composed . He continues to stroll toward us , his white smile widening , his eyes filling with the sight of me as mine are filling with him . At the end of the road , behind him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun flares off it twice , a vehicle . Now there are two figures . One approaching in a spume of dust from the rear , and Gerry , unmindful , not slackening or quickening his pace , continuing on . It is like a choreography design . They move at parallel speeds , in front of our eyes . At the same moment , at the end of our yard , as if we have concluded a performance , both of them halt . Gerry stands , looking toward us , his thumbs in his belt . He nods respectfully to Mom , looks calmly at me , and half smiles . He raises his brows , and we 're suspended . Officer Lovchik emerges from the police car , stooped and tired . He walks up behind Gerry and I hear the snap of handcuffs , then I jump . I 'm stopped by Gerry 's gaze though , as he backs away from me , still smiling tenderly . I am paralyzed halfway down the walk . He kisses the air while Lovchik cautiously prods at him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors slam , the engine roars , and they back out and turn around . As they move away there is no siren . I think I 've heard Lovchik mention questioning . I 'm sure it is lots of fuss for nothing , a mistake , but it can not be denied , this is terrible timing . I shake my shoulders , smooth my skirt , and turn to Mother with a look of outrage . " How do you like that ? " I try . She 's got her purse in one hand , her car keys are out . " Let 's go ; " she says . " Okay , I answer . " Fine . Where ? " " Aunt Mary 's " " I 'd rather go and bail him out , Mom " " Bail ; " she says , " bail ? " She gives me such a look of cold and furious surprise that I sink immediately into the front seat , lean back against the vinyl . I almost welcome the sting of the heated plastic on my back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rugs in the dirt , flattened by the heat of the day Not one of them barks at us to warn her . We step over them and get no more reaction than a whine , the slow beat of a tail . Inside , we get no answers either , although we call Aunt Mary up and down the hall . We enter the kitchen and sit at the table which contains a half-ruined watermelon . By the sink , in a tin box , are cigarettes . My mother takes one and carefully puts the match to it , &owning.; " I know what , " she says . " Go check the lockers " There are two , a big freezer full of labeled meats and rental space , and another , smaller one that is just a side cooler . I notice , walking past the display counter , that the red beacon beside the outside switch of the cooler is glowing . That tells you when the light is on inside . I pull the long metal handle toward me and the thick door swishes open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is there , too proud to even register a hint of surprise . Aunt Mary simply nods and looks away , as though I 've just gone out for a minute , although we 've not seen one another in six months or more . She is relaxing , reading a scientific magazine article . I sit down on a barrel of alum labeled Zanzibar and drop my bomb with no warning . " I 'm married . " It does n't matter how I tell it to Aunt Mary , because she wo n't be , refuses to be , surprised . " What 's he do ? " she simply asks , putting aside the sheaf of paper . I thought the first thing she 'd do is scold me for fooling my mother . But it 's odd . For two women who have lived through boring times and disasters , how rarely one comes to the other 's defense , and how often they are willing to take advantage of the other 's absence . But I 'm benefiting here . It seems that Aunt Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He 's something like a political activist . I mean he 's been in jail and all . But not for any crime , you see , it 's just because of his convictions " She gives me a long shrewd stare . Her skin is too tough to wrinkle , but she does n't look young . All around us hang loops of sausages , every kind you can imagine , every color from the purple-black of blutwurst to the pale whitish links that my mother likes best . Blocks of butter and headcheese , a can of raw milk , wrapped parcels and cured bacons are stuffed onto the shelves around us . My heart has gone still and cool inside of me , and I ca n't stop talking . " He 's the kind of guy it 's hard to describe , very different . People call him a free spirit , but that does n't say it either because he 's very disciplined in some ways . He learned to be neat in jail " I pause , she says nothing , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but who likes weddings ? I hate them , all that mess with the bridesmaids " gowns , getting material to match . I do n't even have girlfriends , I mean , how embarrassing , right ? Who would sing Oh Perfect Love ' ? Carry the ring ? " She is n't really listening . " What 's he do ? " she asks again . Maybe she wo n't let go of it until I discover the right answer , like a game with nouns and synonyms . " He , well he agitates " I tell her . " Is that some kind of factory work ? " " Not exactly , no , it 's not a nine-tofive job or anything ... " She lets the pages fall now , cocks her head to the side , and stares at me without blinking her cold yellow eyes . She has the look of a hawk , of a person who can see into the future but wo n't tell you about it . She 's lost business for staring at customers , but she does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  --  here she shakes her head twice , slowly , from one side to the other without removing me from her stare- " that he does n't have regular work ? " " Oh , what 's the matter anyway , " I say roughly . sTill work . This is the nineteen seventies " She jumps to her feet , stands over me , a stocky woman with terse features and short , thin points of gray hair . Her earrings tremble and flash , small fiery opals . Her brown plastic glasses hang crooked on a cord around her neck . I have never seen her become quite so instantaneously furious , so disturbed . " We 're going to fix that ; " she says . The cooler instantly feels smaller , the sausages knock at my shoulder and the harsh light makes me blink . I am as stubborn as Aunt Mary , however , and she knows that I can go head-to-head with her . " We 're married and that 's final " I manage to stamp my foot . Aunt Mary throws an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away my statement vigorously . " You 're a little girl . How old is he ? " I frown at my lap , trace the threads in my blue cotton skirt and tell her that age is irrelevant . " Big word , she says sarcastically " Let me ask you this . He 's old enough to get a job ? " " Of course he is , what do you think . Okay , he 's older than me . He 's in his thirties " " Aha , I knew it " " So what ? I mean , have n't you ever been in love , has n't someone ever gotten you right here ? " I smash my fist on my chest . We lock eyes , but she does n't waste a second in feeling hurt . " Sure , sure I 've been in love . You think I have n't ? I know what it feels like , you smartmouth . You 'd be surprised . But he was no lazy good-for nothing . Now listen ... " She stops , draws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what I mean by fix . " I 'll teach the sausage-making trade to him , you too , and the grocery business . I 've about had it anyway , and so 's your mother . We 'll do the same as my aunt and uncle-leave the shop to you and mov to Arizona . I like this place " She looks up at the burning bulb , down to me again . Her face drags in the light . " But what the heck . I always wanted to travel " I 'm kind of stunned , a little flattened out , maybe ashamed of myself . " You hate going anywhere , " I say , which is true . The door swings open and Mom comes in with us . She finds a can and balances herself , sighing at the delicious feeling of the air , absorbing from the silence the fact we have talked . She has n't anything to add , I guess , and as the coolness hits her eyes fall shut . Aunt Mary too . I ca n't help it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alert and conscious . From the darkness , I can see us in the brilliance . The light rains down on us . We sit the way we have been sitting , on our cans of milk and flour , upright and still . Our hands are curled loosely in our laps . Our faces are blank as the gods . We could be statues in a tomb sunk into the side of a mountain . We could be dreaming the world up in our brains . It is later and the weather has no mercy . We are drained of everything but simple thoughts . It 's too hot for feelings . Driving home , we see into show held after held even some of beets has soybeans . The into shock , and even some of the burned into The ground . Only ts splay , limp , burned into the ground . continue to struggle sunflowers continue to strut small . upright , bristling but drove me in the first place to What drove merry in the first place to Gerry was the unexpected . I went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then I demonstrated when they came and got him off the stage . He always went so willingly , accommodating everyone . I began to visit him . I sold lunar calenders and posters to raise his bail and eventually free him . One thing led to another and one night we found ourselves alone in a Howard Johnson 's where they put him up when his speech was finished . There were more beautiful women after him , he could have had his pick of Swedes or Yankton Sioux girls , who are the best-looking of all . And then there was no going back once it started , no turning , as though it were meant . We had no choice . I have this intuition as we near the house , in the fateful quality of light , as in the turn of the day the heat continues to press and the blackness , into which the warmth usually lifts , lowers steadily . We must come to the end of something . There must be a close to this day . As we turn into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now it is our turn to be received . I throw the car door open and stumble out before the motor even cuts . I run to him and hold him , as my mother , pursuing the order of events , parks carefully . Then she walks over too , holding her purse by the strap . She stands before him and says no word but simply looks into his face as if he 's cardboard , a man behind glass who can not see her . I think she 's rude , but then I realize that he is staring back , that they are the same height . Their eyes are level . He puts his hand out . " My name is Gerry " " Gerry what ? " " Nanapush " She nods , shifts her weight . " You 're from that line , old strain , the ones She does not finish . " And my father , " Gerry says , " was Old Man Pillager.He has said this before but I never heard any special meaning in it . " Kashpaws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 're probably related through my mother 's brother " They do not move . They are like two opponents from the same divided country , staring across the border . They do not shift or blink and I see that they are more alike than I am like either one of them , so tall , solid , dark-haired . She could be the mother , he the son . " Well , I guess you should come in ; " she offers , " you are a distant relative after all " She looks at me . " Distant enough " Whole swarms of mosquitoes are whining down , discovering us now , so there is no question of staying where we are . And so we walk into the house , much hotter than outside with the gathered heat . Instantly the sweat springs from our skin and I can think of nothing else but cooling of I try to force the windows higher in their sashes , but there 's no breeze anyway , nothing stirs , no air . " Are you sure , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , they 're broke , " my mothers savs , distressed . I rarely hear this in her voice . She switches on the lights , which makes the room seem hotter , and we lower ourselves into the easy chairs . Our words echo as if the walls have baked and dried hollow . " Show me those fans , " says Gerry . My mother points toward the kitchen . They 're sitting on the table . I 've already tinkered with them . See what you can do " And so he does . After a while she hoists herself and walks out back with him . Their voices close together now , absorbed , and their tools dank frantically as if they are fighting a duel . But it is a race with the bell of darkness and their waning energy . I think of ice . I get ice on the brain . " Be right back , " I call out , taking the keys from my mother 's purse , " do you need anything ? " There is no answer from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nuts and bolts spilling to the floor . I drive out to the Super Pumper , a big new gas-station complex on the edge of town where my mother most likely has never been . She does n't know about convenience stores , has no credit cards for groceries , gas , pays only with small bills and change . She never has used an ice machine . It would grate on her that a bag of frozen water costs eighty cents , but it does n't bother me . I take the Styrofoam cooler and I fill it for a couple dollars . I buy two six-packs of Shasta sodas and I plunge them into the uniform coins of ice . I drink two myself , on the way home , and I manage to lift the whole heavy cooler out of the trunk , carry it to the door . The fans are whirling , beating the air . I hear them going in the living room the minute I come in . The only light shines from the kitchen . Gerry and my mother have thrown pillows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are sitting in the rippling currents of air . I bring the cooler in and put it near us . I have chosen all dark flavorsblack cherry , grape , black raspberry , so as we drink it almost seems the darkness swirls inside us with the night air , sweet and sharp , driven by small motors . I drag more pillows from the other rooms upstairs . There is no question of attempting the bedrooms , the stifling beds . And so , in the dark , I hold hands with Gerry as he settles down between my mother and me . He is huge as a hill between the two of us , solid in the beating wind .
