Sure , they 're awfully good . But how do the 1998 Yankees stack up against the other candidates for history 's greatest team ? <P> 1906 CUBS : The only team ever to have won more regular-season games than this year 's Yankees ( 116 ) , and they did it in a shorter season . But the game played by the Cubs of **25;7007;TOOLONG  --  the game everyone played until Babe Ruth came along  --  was a rough scramble for runs made of walks , bunts , stolen bases and singles . The Cubs ' top power hitter , Wildfire Schulte , managed all of seven home runs , typical for the era . If a club like this one had to play the highly evolved 1998 version of the game , it would be bashed into submission . Even by the Arizona Diamondbacks . And by the way : the Cubs lost the World Series to the White Sox . <P> 1909 PIRATES : Won 110 , lost 42  --  which makes them the only Series champion with a higher winning percentage than the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice , but see above . <P> 1927 YANKEES : This powerhouse , led by Ruth and Gehrig , went 110-44 . It disemboweled Pittsburgh in four straight in the Series and has since been widely regarded as the best ever . But these Yankees may , in fact , not even belong in the top five . The magic of the ' 27 season derived in large part from uncanny luck : the team was so free of injury that six of its eight position players enjoyed more than 500 at bats . A good thing this was , for Murderers ' Row obscured a hollow bench whose most productive resident , catcher Johnny Grabowski , contributed exactly one home run and 25 runs batted in . <P> 1931 PHILADELPHIA A 'S : Connie Mack 's finest team won 107 games behind the well-muscled Jimmie Foxx and Al Simmons , with an assist from catcher Mickey Cochrane . The rest of the offense was a collection of relative mediocrities , and beyond the great Lefty Grove ( 31-4 ) , the pitching staff was just better than average . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this squad won the most games and defeated an excellent Brooklyn team in the World Series . But look around the infield : Joe Collins at first , Billy Martin at second , Phil Rizzuto at short and Gil McDougald at third . Good players all , and not one of them would have started for this year 's Yankees . Mickey Mantle had yet to hit 25 home runs in a season or drive in 100 . And even the excellent starting pitchers of ' 53 do n't match up against the six men who made up the fathoms-deep ' 98 rotation . <P> 1953 DODGERS : Won 105 games . Great team with memorable players : Duke Snider and Carl Furillo , Jackie Robinson and Pee Wee Reese . But they lost the Series to the ' 53 Yankees . <P> 1975 CINCINNATI REDS : This imposing group had several superb players . Johnny Bench , Joe Morgan , Tony Perez , Pete Rose : the first two are in the Hall of Fame , the third ought to be , and the last would be if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this year 's Yankee starting lineup could n't compete with the eight everyday players on the ' 75 Reds . This may be true , but just try to name another Cincinnati starting pitcher apart from the hardly immortal Don Gullett . If you said Fredie Norman , Gary Nolan or Jack Billingham , you win a prize . You also pull the plug on the Big Red Machine .
