<p> Sam Norris stood on a subway platform in midtown Manhattan , nearly swimming in his baggy pants , ticking off his favorite brands of jeans . " I like Guess , " said Mr. Norris , 18 , a college student . " Tommy Hilfiger is cool . JNCO are nice ; they 've got the baggy look . " <p> And his opinion of Levi 's  --  once as essential to college life as strong coffee , milk-crate bookshelves and Cup-a-Soup ? " Uh , no , " Mr. Norris said . " Levi 's are sort of , I do n't know , outdated or something . " <p> Mr. Norris had just uttered the one word guaranteed to make executives at Levi Strauss &; Company cringe . In the ever-evolving world of blue jeans , appearing outdated is anathema . And Levi Strauss , along with the VF Corporation and Guess Inc. , the other two biggest purveyors of the most fundamental fixture of American wardrobes , are finding their market invaded by hotter , more fashion-conscious manufacturers . After years of growth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three percentage points . <p> In the last two years , a host of new players has stormed onto the blue-jeans scene , producing everything from the wider , funky look that appeals to teen-agers to more stylish cuts that older folks feel comfortable wearing to work on dress-down Fridays . And while the industry has always attracted upstarts  --  Guess grew from one style sold at Bloomingdale 's in 1981 to a $486 million business  --  what is different this time is the sheer volume of the competition . <p> It is less a challenge than a siege . Fashion houses , including Tommy Hilfiger , Calvin Klein , Mossimo , Ralph Lauren and Donna Karan , have all spewed out new designs . A cottage industry of tiny companies concentrated in Los Angeles has sprouted , offering offbeat cuts and zany touches that younger consumers love . And two of the biggest buyers of mainstream brands , the J. C. Penney Company and Sears , Roebuck &; Company , have come out with their own wildly popular lines . <p> Further , the mighty threesome of denim of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a division of Levi Strauss Associates , recently announced that it would lay off about 1,000 people to save $80 million , largely because sales are growing more slowly than costs . VF , with headquarters in Wyomissing , Pa. , maker of the Lee , Wrangler and other brands and the nation 's No. 1 jeans company by sales , is consolidating its buying and decreasing the number of employees in some divisions . And Guess , based in Los Angeles , has turned its focus more to its other apparel and to its international business . <p> All three are fighting to hold onto their customers . Josephine Esquivel , an apparel analyst at Morgan Stanley , calculates that VF 's share of the jeans market fell to 27 percent last year from 30 percent in 1995 . Guess 's portion declined slightly to about 10 percent , and Levi 's stabilized or may have declined a bit at 20 percent after years of increasing its slice of the jeans pie . <p> It is a big pie : Sales of jeans in the United States grew 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NPD Group , a market research firm in Port Washington , L.I . Yet , with sales falling short of expectations , the big jeans companies ended up with too much denim on their hands and cut back on orders to the mills by as much as 20 percent . <p> The major jeans companies insist they are doing just fine . " We have sold more Levi 's brand than ever last year in the U.S. market , " said Gavin Power , a company spokesman for Levi Strauss . " That said , competition is more intense than it has ever been . " <p> Teen-agers are leading the drift away from the Big Three . Asked in a survey last fall by Teen-age Research Unlimited , a market research firm in Northbrook , Ill. , what brands of jeans they owned , 56 percent cited Levi 's , down one percentage point from the results of a similar poll conducted two years earlier ; 44 percent named VF 's main two brands , down five percentage points ; while 21 percent mentioned Guess , down from 30 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were pretty drab compared with the gains recorded by the competition . The proportion owning Calvin Klein jeans more than doubled to 18 percent from 8 percent ; those citing Arizona , Penney 's private label , shot up to 27 percent from 19 percent , while 4 percent said they had a pair of Sears 's new Canyon River Blues hanging in their closets . Results comparing 1996 and 1995 showed a similar trend . <p> The designer-jeans craze is a reprise of a 1980 's phenomenon , but with a whole host of new entrants  --  notably Ralph Lauren , Tommy Hilfiger , and Donna Karan  --  that have tremendous marketing and money behind them . <p> This time , beyond the extra competitors , the designer houses are pricing their products much more competitively . " Designer Holdings said , ' We can market this much more aggressively if we bring the price points down , ' " Ms. Esquivel , the apparel analyst , said , referring to the maker of Calvin Klein jeans . It cut prices by about $5 a pair . As important , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinctive brand images  --  Calvin Klein 's youthful sexiness , Donna Karan 's urban sophistication and Ralph Lauren 's WASP-ish affluence  --  to their jeans products . <p> In a separate challenge to the big jeans makers , private-label brands for big retailers have been gobbling up a tiny but growing chunk of the market . The trend , which many date back to 1991 , when Gap Inc. started to sell its own line to the exclusion of other brands , has spread to bigger chains . Sales of J. C. Penney 's Arizona jeans have surged to $1 billion last year from $50 million in 1991 , the year of their introduction . And Sears , which introduced its Canyon River Blue line in 1995 , is well on its way to catching up with Arizona , analysts say , though the company would not disclose sales figures for the brand . <p> The smaller jeans makers popping up in Los Angeles and elsewhere tend to have a closer handle than the established giants on the likes and dislikes of adolescent consumers . Thus , they were quick to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , colored jeans , and jeans with fancy pockets and other accouterments . <p> Take JNCO , which started 12 years ago as a manufacturer of jeans for young men and expanded last year into the boys ' and juniors ' markets . The secret to the popularity of their lines , executives at JNCO said , is their close contact with shoppers . JNCO has a website featuring surveys that read as if they were written by a 15-year-old , and the company sponsors or attends extreme-sports events that are littered with their target consumer  --  a 12- to 20-year-old skateboard or surfing enthusiast . <p> " We keep in constant touch with our customer , " said Tam Miller , vice president of sales and marketing at JNCO . " We pay very close attention to everything they say . In my neighborhood , there is a skating ramp and I go there and bring samples all the time . When I go home , all the kids run around and ask , ' What 's new ? ' " <p> JNCO features jeans that range from boot cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jeans also tend to hang lower on the hips , exposing the navel , a popular style among those with a newly minted driver 's license and a toned tummy . Further , many of the new generation of jeans companies add diverting little asides to the jeans . One of them , Menace , also based in Los Angeles , adds its cartoon-kid corporate mascot on the pocket of each pair . <p> Menace , founded four years ago , sold $25 million in jeans last year , said its president , David Ahdoot . While that is not much compared with Levi Strauss , which boasted sales of $4.3 billion last year , there is evidence that Menace and other small brands are gaining ground . <p> Pacific Sunwear of California , a chain of 210 stores based in Anaheim , Calif. , that caters to teen-agers , does not even carry the standard names in denim . Instead , the company sells its own private label , Bullhead Breakdown , as well as JNCO and Menace , and a handful of other small brands like Generation X and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People can go anywhere to buy Levi 's , " Carl Womack , Pacific Sunwear 's chief financial officer , said . " Fashion-oriented kids do n't come to us for that . The only way we can distinguish ourselves is with smaller brands . JNCO has gone from almost none of our business to about 10 percent over a period of a year . " <p> Of the Big Three jeans makers , Levi Strauss seems to be landing the most effective counterpunches . Its sales rose 7 percent last year , slightly less than the overall market , though the increase slowed from 9 percent in 1995 and from double-digit gains in some previous years ; it still holds a giant chunk of the market , and it remains popular among mainstream American teen-agers . <p> Further , the company has made some moves to keep its grip firmly on the young buying masses  --  for instance , its introduction last fall of a wide-leg version of its silver and red tab jeans . <p> The marketing moves may be working . Oleg Korenfeld , 19 , another college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craze already , and likes to wear Levi 's silver tabs now that they offer them baggy . " I like it loose and big , " he said of the jeans . " I do n't go for JNCO or Calvin or any of that techno stuff . " <p> VF , for its part , has added a new line to its Lee brand that features more complicated styling and wider cuts for a slightly higher price than its traditional offerings , and is also developing more youth-oriented baggy cuts , said VF 's chief executive , Mackey J. McDonald . <p> Guess , while still hawking blue jeans , is trying to grab shoppers with stretch pants , low-slung fashion pants and the like . <p> The big players still hold a lot of the cards , of course , and have the financial and marketing wherewithal to adapt to the changing tastes of a fickle , teen-dominated market . In contrast , many of the new entrants will be hard pressed to survive any sudden collective decision by the young and hip that they have suddenly become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of firms are likely to end up on the cutting room floor . " Before , you had Levi 's silver tab and Guess only , " said John Heldrich , the chief executive of Swift Denim , a manufacturer in Columbus , Ga . said . " Now , you have CK , Polo , Mossimo and Nautica , who have all entered this area with a lot of promotion and excitement . All of them had a pretty aggressive plan of growth and all of them ca n't achieve it . " <p> Sales of blue jeans are growing , but a deluge of new competitors has cut into the dominance of the traditional market leaders . Graph shows retail sales of jeans from 1993 to 1996 .
