The ancient Greek painters Zeuxis and Parrhasius vied , according to legend , to see who could produce the most realistic painting . Zeuxis illustrated grapes so lifelike that birds swooped down and tried to eat them . Parrhasius outdid him , however , by fashioning a curtain that Zeuxis , mistaking for fabric , attempted to pull open . A long line of artists have since striven to equal Parrhasius ' success by bestowing an illusory third dimension to flat , featureless walls and ceilings . Known as trompe l'oeil ( fool the eye ) , the style reached its prime in the Renaissance and during the Baroque period , when painters embellished churches and palaces with imaginary soaring columns , weighty domes and clouded skies inhabited by plump putti . <P> Few artists have carried on the tradition in the 20th century , with its predilection for spare , abstract , modernist forms . But of those who have , the worthiest successor to Parrhasius is muralist Richard Haas , 54 . " Walls present some of the most interesting and challenging surfaces in an urban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as large canvases for an artist to come and paint on . " <P> And so he has . In Miami Beach , Haas transformed the annex of a beachfront hotel into an Art Deco triumphal arch with gargantuan caryatids . In Cincinnati , on the facade of an office building , he simulated a Piranesian cutaway of a coffered Roman temple . His latest creation , on a lobby wall in Boston , is a lyrical evocation of a 19th century crystal pavilion , complete with painted palm trees and an image of tumbling water that blurs into a real fountain . <P> Growing up in Spring Green , Wis. , Haas used to help his great uncle , who was the stonemason at Frank Lloyd Wright 's home . He studied painting at the University of Wisconsin , Milwaukee , and earned a Master of Fine Arts degree at the University of Minnesota , but architectural references kept creeping into his work . After moving to New York City in 1968 , he came to public attention with a proposal to paint a series of haunting silhouettes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former sites . In his first actual mural , on an all-but-blank side wall of a cast-iron structure , he painted windows and trim that uncannily duplicated the building 's street front . The painting has since become as much of a landmark as its surroundings . <P> In a functional , no-frills era , Haas boldly mixes styles and allusions , paying tribute to master builders and reviving the richness and variety of earlier ages . Every Haas mural has the flair and comic touch of the Baroque  --  art striving for the grand impression . " The real talent is to know how little to do to get a lot , " he says . " That is the theatrical effect . "
