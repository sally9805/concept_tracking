Natural selectionworking on host and pathogen alike drives some devastating bargains . // The sum of the squares of the legs of a right triangle equals the square of the hypotenuse . This mathematical insight , passed down over the centuries , is credited to Pythagoras , the Greek philosopher and mathematician who lived in southern Italy 2,500 years ago . We also credit Pythagoras with saying , " Do not eat broad beans ! " History does not record his reason for this injunction , and it was long the subject of speculation by historians and philosophers alike . On the face of it , the whole issue seems bizarre . For millennia , broad beans have been a nutritious and palatable staple in Europe , the Middle East , and Africa . But for a significant minority of people from southern Italy and Greece , eating broad beans can result in a severe , sometimes fatal anemia . This illness , called glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) deficiency , or favism , arises in people with two copies of a mutant gene . Having one copy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But those unlucky enough to inherit two copies-one from the mother and one from the father-suffer from abnormal sensitivity to moderately toxic compounds , such as those found in broad beans . In southern Italy and Greece , about one-third of the population has a mutation in the gene that codes for G6PD-an enzyme that aids energy extraction in red blood cells . So there may well have been a simple , practical reason for the Pythagorean admonition : broad beans were actually dangerous to many in the local population . Malaria was probably endemic in southern Italy from ancient times until the 1940s , when the Anopheles mosquitoes that carry it were largely eradicated with DDT . Thus , people in the region who carried one copy of the G6PD mutation received a great boost in evolutionary " fitness " - that is , they were more likely than others to survive and propagate their genes into the next generation . This account should be sounding familiar . If we look around the world , we repeatedly see evidence that certain genetic diseases are themselves defenses against infectious disease . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Africa : both are the body 's scorched-earth tactics , keeping invaders from using the resources of the invaded . A single copy of the G6PD deficiency gene ( even though it keeps red blood cells from efficiently metabolizing energy ) prevents the malarial parasite from efficiently invading red blood cells . Likewise , a single gene for sickle-cell hemoglobin ( even though it diminishes the function and longevity of the red blood cells ) thwarts attack by the malarial parasite . When someone inherits two copies of the gene coding for sickle-cell hemoglobin , however , the red blood cells are distorted into a sickle shape . The deformed cells rupture easily , block capillary beds , and increase vulnerability to infection . Northern Europeans have evolved their own genetic defenses against infection . A recent study by Gerald B. Pier and his associates at the Brigham and Women 's Hospital of the Harvard Medical School indicates that cystic fibrosis-a disease affecting mainly northern Europeans-is probably an adaptive defense against Salmonella typhi , the bacterium that causes typhoid fever . The most serious feature of cystic fibrosis is obstruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protein in the cells lining the respiratory tract thickens the mucus , trapping pathogens and reducing the lungs ' capacity to clear infection . The Pier team found that a gene coding for that defective lung-cell protein also codes for a defective protein in the intestine-where it may hinder S. typhi from attaching itself to the intestinal lining . We call this the boarded-window defense-boarding up the windows of a house may block out light and air , but it also makes the house less vulnerable to burglars . In the case of cystic fibrosis , a single copy of the gene codes for the protein that bars entry to S. typhi but still allows the intestinal cell to perform its normal activities . Having two copies of the gene causes cystic fibrosis-a disease that , before antibiotics , killed most of its victims before the age of two . This tragic disease is the price paid for protection against typhoid fever , but in Europe prior to the twentieth century , S. typhi ( ubiquitous in contaminated water ) infected almost everyone early in life and typically killed about 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C in northwest Africa and hemoglobin E in Southeast Asia are scorched-earth defenses-they defend against malaria and are also caused by a change in a single amino acid on the hemoglobin molecule . Another malarial defense , Melanesian ovaloctosis , is caused by a mutation that alters red blood cell membranes . It is lethal in those who have two copies of the gene . What accounts for the evolution of such seemingly crude and self  --  destructive defenses ? Sometimes a crude defense may be better than none at all , and crude defenses are easy to generate . While most adaptations involve an orchestration of several genes , self-destructive defenses typically consist of a simple change that interferes with only one gene 's primary function . Even though such mutations may harm us by altering biological machinery fine-tuned over millennia by natural selection , they help us by interfering with the similarly finely calibrated mechanisms of an infectious adversary . These high-risk genes maintain a constant level in populations : they are fairly common but do not affect the majority because their spread is self-limited . When the sickle-cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its host , who may then pass on single copies of the new mutant to a few offspring . Those who inherit it have a survival advantage because they can not be felled by a widespread cause of death-malaria . The trait 's subsequent spread through the population is virtually cost free until the gene becomes so common that children begin inheriting it from both parents . At that point , the death rate of these children ( without intervention , sickle-cell anemia kills its victims long before they reach reproductive age ) acts as a brake against the trait 's spread into subsequent generations . Photograph Opposite : A sickle cell among normal red blood cells . The deformed cells rupture easily , blocking capillary beds. // Ironically , the high cost of such defenses is also the very reason they stick around , in stable form , over the long run . Why ? Because if the defense had no disadvantage , the gene coding for it would spread through the host population until it was more common than any other variant . With no suitable hosts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it had ever afflicted us or that we had ever adapted to it ) or ( if a timely mutation appeared ) bounce back in a mutant form that could get around the original defense . But with very devastating diseases like sickle-cell anemia and cystic fibrosis , the proportion of people carrying the gene never rises above a low frequency . If only one in ten carries the defense gene , there may be little or no selection pressure favoring a mutant form of the pathogen . The malarial parasite continues to perpetuate itself by infecting the 90 percent of people who lack the defense gene entirely . To some people , the story of sickle-cell anemia demonstrates that natural selection is such a feeble process that it can not generate an effective defense against malaria without botching up the blood system . But the evolutionary reasoning presented above offers an alternative viewpoint . Selection may be continually presenting effective defenses against many terrible diseases , but such defenses are not apparent because selection is acting powerfully on both host and pathogen . As a consequence , the effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later era . In addition , because the malaria protozoa are more damaging than most other parasites , the defenses against them offer greater fitness benefits ; hence , more incidental harm can be tolerated . Self-destructive defenses against milder pathogens may also exist , but scientists may have overlooked them because so few people have two copies of the defense genes . One benefit of this evolutionary approach to understanding disease is its usefulness in analyzing the past . But what about its predictive value ? We think that the concept of self-destructive defenses , coupled with insights about how genes persist in populations , has predictive possibilities . When a genetic defect is too common to be sustained by a random mutation and too widespread or stable to be accounted for by a founder effect ( persistence of a gene in a small population of closely related people ) , then we have the smoking gun of a self-destructive defense . Using this logic , we predict that hemochromatosis-a syndrome in which iron builds up in the body and which is found primarily in northern Europeans-will eventually prove to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About one in ten northern Europeans carries a single copy of the hemochromatosis gene ; those with two copies usually develop a combination of serious ailments , including liver disease , diabetes , infertility , heart failure , and increased susceptibility to rare pathogens . These individuals have a defective protein in their intestines and other organs . The normal protein is embedded in the cell membrane , but the defective protein is not . This switch in location is just the kind of alteration-a boarded  --  window defense-that could block a pathogen that would normally latch onto the protein to enter a cell . In addition , the trait is too common to be maintained by random mutation and too widespread geographically to be the result of a founder effect . Some researchers hypothesize that an increased ability to absorb iron may be the hidden benefit of the hemochromatosis gene . But the disease is most common where iron-rich foods , such as meat , are the rule in local diets . Moreover , a crude defense that destroys a gene 's function would more likely be favored because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of a nutrient . We therefore suspect that hemochromatosis , like cystic fibrosis , is a boarded-window defense that evolved in response to an as yet unknown pathogen . Other self-destructive defenses are more like rogue cops than boarded windows . We suspect that alphasub 1antitrypsin deficiency falls into this category . This enzyme deficiency causes emphysema and liver disease in northern Europeans who inherit two copies of the gene . The affected protein controls the level of elastase , an enzyme that makes elastic cartilage more permeable to the cells of the immune system . In an alphasub 1-antitrypsin-deficient individual , absence of this control may cause maverick elastase activity , improving access for the immune-system cells but damaging tissue in the process . Like a rogue cop , the cells ' trypsin may fire first and ask questions later , causing much collateral damage . The net result may be increased protection against pathogens , along with increased risk of the tissue damage associated with emphysema and cirrhosis . If this line of reasoning is correct , having one copy of the alpha , - antitrypsin deficiency gene should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prediction awaits definitive testing , researchers at Cambridge University , England , reported some intriguing findings in 1998 . Patients with both cystic fibrosis and alphasub 1-antitrypsin deficiency had less severe respiratory problems than did patients with cystic fibrosis alone . The researchers were somewhat puzzled by this apparent paradox , but a medical evolutionist might posit that the unleashing of rogue cops through alpha , - antitrypsin deficiency helps control some of the infections that are so problematic to cystic fibrosis patients . There are practical reasons to investigate whether genetic diseases are self-destructive defenses. // Oocysts of malarial parasites ( blue ) on a mosquito 's stomach wall ; the parasites are later transmitted to humans via the bite of the female mosquito . // The solution to these problems will come from future research . If hemochromatosis and alpha , - antitrypsin deficiency prove to be self-destructive defenses , then the evolutionary synthesis of genetics , epidemiology , and medicine will have moved up one notch in credibility and utility . // Salmonella typhi , the typhoid fever bacterium , once killed about 5 percent of northern Europeans . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
