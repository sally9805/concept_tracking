Section : U.S. News Somalia , not Operation Desert Storm , may be the real new world order <p> Dateline : United Nations ; Paris <p> For more than two decades , the African nation of Somalia was a pawn in the global battle between communism and democracy . First the Soviet Union and then the United States poured millions of dollars ' worth of weaponry into the sparsely populated Muslim nation in their struggle over what was then called the strategic Horn of Africa . ' When the cold war ended , Somali President Mohammed Siad Barre fell from power and the country slipped back into obscurity . But the killing only intensified as local warlords turned their Kalashnikovs and M-16s on aid workers and even on relief ships . Where man left off the killing , nature stepped in : Three years of drought have dried up water supplies , killed livestock and baked cornfields into concrete . <p> While more than 300,000 Somalis died of hunger , the world remained largely indifferent . It took a tongue-lashing from U.N . Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a rich man 's war ' in white Bosnia while hundreds of thousands of black Somalis starved to death , to persuade the United States to begin relief airlifts last August . Since then , however , only 500 Pakistanis of an already authorized 3,500-man United Nations peacekeeping force have been deployed . Somali warlords and freelance bandits are stealing some 75 percent of the relief supplies , and negotiations between the U.N . and the warlords to get aid through have gotten nowhere . While tons of food pile up in Mogadishu , the Somali capital , nearly half of the country 's approximately 7 million people have already died or are at risk of starvation . <p> But last week , after Somali irregulars shelled a United Nations relief ship , robbed relief workers at gunpoint and wounded a U.N . soldier , a clearly exasperated Boutros-Ghali told Security Council members that only military force can get relief supplies to the needy . The Bush administration stirred from its post-election depression and offered to send up to 30,000 U.S. troops to Somalia as part of a multinational force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect . Gen. Colin Powell , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , explained the sudden American change of heart to U.S. News : The situation on the ground , ' he said , has turned critical . ' <p> President-elect Bill Clinton appeared to endorse President Bush 's offer , saying he has long felt we should do more for Somalia . ' Acting Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger reportedly told Boutros-Ghali that U.S. troops will be out before Clinton 's January 20 inauguration . But Clinton may discover that far more than Bush 's swift defeat of Iraq in Operation Desert Storm , the anarchic situation in Somalia is the archetype of the real new world order  --  nasty and brutish but not necessarily short . <p> Despite the American offer , organizing a new U.N . force , and agreeing on who will command it , may prove difficult . And having now decided it is willing to intervene in Somalia , the United States may have to explain why it remains unwilling to use force to stop the killing in Bosnia or Liberia , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assorted other new world disorders . Cynics will argue that the main difference between Somalia and Yugoslavia is that Somalia 's warlords are pushovers compared with the better-trained and equipped Serbian irregulars . <p> But while they are untrained and unorganized , Somalia 's warlords do pose problems . In its 20-plus years as a superpower surrogate , Somalia accumulated a fierce if somewhat dated military arsenal that includes mortars , artillery and antiaircraft weapons . It 's old stuff , ' says a senior Pentagon official , but you can die just as easily from it . ' <p> Unlike Saddam Hussein 's Republican Guard , which stayed in the desert to be killed , the Somali gangs live and die among civilians . The air power and artillery that counted so heavily in the Persian Gulf are of less value against teenagers in jeeps on city streets . The rules of engagement  --  to shoot or not to shoot  --  are harder , and so is avoiding civilian casualties . Troops sent for humanitarian purposes may come to be seen as partisans , and then as targets . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States learned in Lebanon , getting into quarrels like the ones in Somalia is easier than getting out of them again , especially when there is no legitimate government to take over when the shooting stops . Some analysts warn that the U.N. , by backing a military intervention , will undercut its already tenuous credibility as an honest broker and lose any chance of negotiating a political settlement . Restoring some order should not be all that difficult ; it 's what comes after that is troubling , ' says a senior U.S. officer . <p> Leaders of the warring factions are expected to meet in Ethiopia this week for a first round of diplomatic negotiations . But some analysts warn that it already may be too late , and that nothing less than an international trusteeship  --  possibly lasting for years  --  can hope to solve Somalia 's desperate problems . <p> In Somalia , some relief workers heralded the U.S. offer of protection as long overdue  --  especially if a new force is , as expected , allowed to shoot back at bandits . Under current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corps , one of the main American relief agencies in Somalia , until a guy pulls the trigger and blows you away , all you can do is smile at him . ' <p> Others , however , warn that massive foreign intervention would only increase the chaos on the ground and turn all foreigners into targets . In a city like this , where everyone is armed , you can have anyone taken out and blame it on bandits , ' says one foreign relief worker in Mogadishu . <p> The Security Council is expected to decide early this week whether to accept Bush 's offer of American troops . If the Security Council agrees to Washington 's new offer , American military planners say , it will take two weeks to get the full force in place . A four-ship , 2,000-member Marine Amphibious Ready Group , diverted late last week from a planned exercise in the Persian Gulf , is expected to arrive off the Somali coast this week . <p> Pentagon planners say that if all goes well , American forces should have to remain in Somalia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a point that is clearly definable where we can say We did our part , we 're out of here , ' ' says a top Pentagon official . <p> The administration 's three-phase plan calls for a massive show of American force to swiftly put down the worst of the fighting and break the supply logjams . A contingent of as many as 30,000 troops  --  possibly from the 82nd Airborne Division and the 101st Air Assault Division  --  would secure the main port of Mogadishu , the capital 's airport and the roads leading from the city to Somalia 's four or five key feeding centers . <p> Once a semblance of order has been restored , U.S. officials suggest , the U.S.-led multilateral force would be replaced by a smaller U.N . peacekeeping force . At the same time , the U.N . would work on negotiating a full cease-fire and begin the task of rebuilding some local political authority . A third phase would see local Somali guards and police forces take over peacekeeping and relief-escort duties . <p> It is hard to pin down exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bush White House and the Pentagon suddenly did about-faces . For months , midlevel officials at the State Department had been pushing for a greater U.S. commitment to Somalia , only to be argued down by higher-ups wary of a military quagmire  --  most notably Powell and National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft  --  and by a Bush White House caught up in a losing election campaign . <p> Somali Storm ? White House sources say a change of heart last week by General Powell , backed by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney , convinced Bush of the need for immediate , drastic action . At a key meeting in the Oval Office last Wednesday , Powell argued eloquently that the suffering in Somalia has gone on far too long and that if the United States is going to get involved , nothing less than a massive Desert Storm-style operation will be needed . <p> By late last week , the U.N . appeared to be leaning toward the American offer . Like the United States , Boutros-Ghali is expected to insist that any intervention force be multilateral . But another American condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they did during the gulf war  --  may be less attractive to the U.N . chief , who has been arguing for months for the creation of a rapid-reaction force under U.N . multinational command . <p> But perhaps the biggest question now facing BoutrosGhali , the United Nations and the United States is what would come after any military intervention they are able to organize  --  a diplomatic settlement or a political and military quagmire . If intervention succeeds in Somalia , the U.N . will have accepted a new mission , not only to keep peace but also to intervene in order to make it . Yet in a world of increasing disorder and pain , there may be no other choice . <p> Picture : New storm ? Bush ( Darryl Heikes  --  USN &WR); <p> Picture : Think big .
