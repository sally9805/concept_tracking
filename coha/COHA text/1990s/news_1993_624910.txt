<p> Sports in America is no game ; it 's a $ 25 billion a year business . <p> In Showtime 's " " Naked Sports : Four Portraits , " that business gets the business from the same Emmy-winning producers who gave us " " Naked Hollywood " a couple of years ago . <p> This Oxford Television and International Television Entertainment program has run on Britain 's Channel 4 , and the Brits do have a way of cutting through the fluff . <p> This time executive producer Andy Paterson and producer Nicolas Kent turn their cameras on the bare bones of high stakes sports , as seen from the perspective of The Team Owner , The Player , The Promoter and The Team . <p> Those titles represent , respectively , Marge Schott , the controversial , if not politically correct , owner of the Cincinnati Reds ; basketball superstar Michael Jordan ; fight promoter Dan Duva , and that gang up north that likes to call itself America 's Team , the Dallas Cowboys . <p> It premieres on Showtime at 9 p.m . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 12:20 a.m . July 26 . <p> These portraits are well-drawn but not overlong in this 75-minute package . They 're heavy on the artsy-craftsy production tricks , but very up-close and personal and extra nosy about butting into the business that has become a most lucrative livelihood for so many . <p> It 's ladies night first , with Schott as the lead-off example for the complaints of baseball executives and sportswriters . <p> " " Baseball is a mess , " they say . " " We 've started to run baseball the way we run the U.S.  --  in debt <p> Next year we 'll lose $ 150 million to $ 200 million <p> Somebody has killed the golden goose . " " " It 's war , " says one writer , who predicts " " difficult negotiations and a long work stoppage ahead " about escalating player salaries . <p> On this rainy night in Cincinnati , owner Schott is in the ball park with her St. Bernard , the dog she loves and her players hate . Schott thinks players make too much money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseball today , " she says , and it makes her mad when one of them grouses that he had to spend $ 100 to rent a tux for a command performance at a charity do at her estate . " " It 's the only thing I ask them to do all year , " she grouses back . And , with a point toward the performing live elephants at her party , " " Why ca n't we teach them to play and get rid of the players ? " <p> The portrait , does , of course , draw upon the recent headline event that resulted in Schott 's one-year suspension for conduct unbecoming to Major League Baseball . When asked if she did use racial slurs she was accused of using about her players , her reply is : " " Anything 's possible . " <p> " " In Texas , " as " " Naked Sports " moves on , " " football is a religion truly next to God for most people . It 's even on Sunday , the holy day . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schramm and Tom Landry to Jerry Jones and Jimmy Johnson , and naturally this one has the most chance of hooking the locals . You wo n't learn anything you did n't already know , but it 's still fascinating to football fans . <p> " " I wanted to build a team with style and class . I wanted us to be America 's team , " says Schramm . " " That Landry was a Christian had an effect on the fans . " Schramm tells how the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders were born , and how their sexy image was a surprise that he " " did n't back away from . " <p> " " The cheerleaders fed off Tom ( Landry 's ) Christian image , too , " says sportswriter Skip Bayless . " " But I was against it , " says Landry , speaking for himself . <p> The legend of Landry ended abruptly with the arrival of the Cowboys ' new owner , Arkansas oil millionaire Jerry Jones , and this report details that change . <p> " " The first thing they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go tell him that , " Schramm recalls . <p> " " I heard it on TV , " Landry says shortly . " " He did n't have to come , but he did . " <p> There 's news film of Jones introducing his best friend and new head coach , Jimmy Johnson , to a stony-faced press conference in Dallas . As Bayless ' flight of possible overstatement recalls , " " Jerry Jones stumbled into the toughest situation any man ever faced . He obliterated that team . He could not have done it without a lifetime contract from his friend Jerry Jones . " <p> For Johnson , winning was the only option , and win they did . <p> This portrait shows that , too . <p> Next comes The Player  --  Michael Jordan , hailed here as " " the greatest basketball player , or the greatest athlete of all time . " <p> " " If you invent an athlete for the ' 90s , he is it , " says his agent , David Falk . <p> " " I 'd play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jordan explains . <p> " " I get paid . I 've been able to sign with all the sponsors . It 's the business aspect of my profession . " He gets paid more than $ 4 million a year to play for the Chicago Bulls . He makes six to eight times that per year in endorsements . <p> Nike was Jordan 's biggest business deal , and it is reported here in depth , and with some surprising asides . Jordan confesses that he really likes Adidas better than Nike shoes and would have gone with them if they 'd met Nike 's offer . They did n't . But Nike did let him create his own line of shoes . <p> Agent Falk recounts how he made the deal , and Jordan 's happy employers at Nike tell what his endorsement has meant to their profits columns . No wonder Nike 's CEO does his interview from Nike 's sparkling , skyscraping Michael Jordan Building . <p> The Promoter catches up with Dan Duva at Caesar 's Palace , " " where legends are made and where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 million , or get killed in the ring . " <p> Duva is in Vegas promoting his then-heavyweight champion , Evander Holyfield , as he prepares to defend his title and their millions against challenger Larry Holmes . But this story has its local hook , too . It starts in Houston , 10 days before the fight , at Holyfield 's training camp here . <p> " " Always at our house we spoke three languages  --  American , Italian and boxing , " says Dan Duva 's father , Lou , who is Holyfield 's trainer . <p> Today , " " when you get Lou Duva , you get his whole family , " as they say . From promoter Dan to his publicist wife , Kathy , all the way down to the clerks and the go-fers . They 're all involved in the business , and their close family seldom grants outsiders such an inside look at the Duvas in action . <p> The motto of a wise promoter , as one insider ventures , is " " Boxers come and go . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People ask me if I bet on the fights , " Dan Duva shrugs . " " You bet I do  --  I bet more than anybody . " Without betting , that is . <p> As one boxing writer analyzes , " " No one falls from the height a boxer does when his days are over . He comes from the absolute dregs , and he reaches the absolute pinnacle . " <p> There are some most effective moments with Holyfield himself , as he confronts that possibility . " " What I like about ( boxing ) is , no one controls your destiny , " he says .
