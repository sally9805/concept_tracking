<p> The evidence against Davon Neverdon seemed overwhelming . <p> Four eyewitnesses testified that they saw him kill a man in a robbery attempt . Two others said he told them he committed the crime . Even Neverdon was expecting to be convicted : He had offered to plead guilty in exchange for a 40-year sentence , a deal the prosecutor had rejected at the request of the victim 's family . <p> But that was n't how the Baltimore jury , which included 11 African Americans , saw it . After 11 hours of deliberation , they acquitted the defendant , who is black . A note from the jury room before the July 28 verdict suggested an explanation for the contrarian result : " Race , " the lone Asian-American juror informed the judge , " may be playing some part " in the jury 's decision-making . <p> Commentators have warned during the yearlong ordeal of the O. J. Simpson case  --  which ended in not-guilty verdicts Tuesday  --  that a juror 's race does n't dictate his or her verdict and that evidence matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jury watchers are concluding that , as in the Neverdon case , race plays a far more significant role in jury verdicts than many people involved in the justice system prefer to acknowledge . And rather than condemn this influence , some legal scholars argue that it fits neatly into a tradition of political activism by U.S. juries . <p> The case of Darryl Smith in 1990 is a less-celebrated example of how race can affect a criminal trial . After an all-black jury in Washington acquitted Smith of murder in March , 1990 , a letter from an anonymous juror arrived at the Superior Court there . The letter said that while most jurors in the case believed that Smith was guilty , the majority bowed to holdouts who " did n't want to send any more young black men to jail . " <p> The phenomenon of race-based verdicts is n't limited to blacks , of course . In past years , all-white juries , particularly in the South , nearly always convicted blacks accused of crimes against whites , regardless of the evidence  --  while whites who raped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers charged in the videotaped beating of Rodney King were acquitted in Simi Valley , Calif. , in 1992 , many observers attributed the verdict to the fact that 10 of the jurors were white and none was black . <p> But the willingness of many blacks to side with African-American defendants against a mostly white-dominated justice system is a relatively new phenomenon with specific roots and ramifications , according to researchers who have analyzed recent jury verdicts . <p> At the simplest level , they say , minority jurors are merely drawing on their own life experiences , as jurors are expected to do , in evaluating evidence . Based on such experiences , they are quicker than whites to suspect racism on the part of police and prosecutors and thus more likely than whites to distrust the evidence they present . <p> A recent USA Today-CNN-Gallup poll found that 66 percent of blacks believe the criminal-justice system is racist , compared with 37 percent of whites . <p> But some black jurors are taking a further , much more significant step : They are choosing to disregard the evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injustice and to refrain from adding to the already large number of blacks behind bars . <p> Most black jurors " understand how fine the line is between doing well and being on trial , " said Thomas I. Atkins , a defense lawyer who is former general counsel of the NAACP . For many blacks , he said , " it 's not enough to merely conclude that the right person is on trial and that the evidence is sufficient . You also have to prove that the right thing to come out of this trial is a conviction . " <p> The race factor seems particularly evident in such urban environments as the New York City borough of the Bronx , where juries are more than 80 percent black and Hispanic . There , black defendants are acquitted in felony cases 47.6 percent of the time  --  nearly three times the national acquittal rate of 17 percent for all races . Hispanics are acquitted 37.6 percent of the time . This is so even though the majority of crime victims in the Bronx are black or Hispanic . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by race , overall figures for heavily black urban areas suggest that the Bronx phenomenon extends elsewhere . In Washington , D.C. , where more than 95 percent of defendants and 70 percent of jurors are black , 28.7 percent of all felony trials ended in acquittals last year , significantly above the national average . In Wayne County , Mich. , which includes mostly black Detroit , 30 <p> percent of felony defendants were acquitted in 1993 , the last year for which statistics were available . <p> . <p> Some black lawyers and scholars argue that any defiance of what blacks perceive as a racist system falls within the tradition of so-called jury nullification  --  the rejection of the law in favor of the jurors ' own views of justice . They note that this controversial power , which the U.S. Supreme Court explicitly affirmed 100 years ago , has played an important role at key times in U.S. history . <p> During colonial times , jurors used the power to acquit defendants of political crimes against Great Britain . In the mid-19th century , Northern jurors acquitted people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made this a crime . The constitutional prohibition against trying a person twice for the same crime protects the defendant in all such circumstances from having an acquittal overturned because the jurors did n't follow the law . <p> Some jury-nullification advocates now say blacks are justified in using their jury-room vote to fight what they perceive as a national crisis : a justice system that is skewed against them by courts , prosecutors and racist police such as former Los Angeles detective Mark Fuhrman . <p> " Jury nullification is power that black people have right now and not something Congress has to give them , " said Paul Butler , a black criminal-law professor at George Washington University . In a forthcoming law review article , Butler even argues that in nonviolent crimes , black jurors should " presume in favor of nullification . " <p> " Black people , " he writes , " have a community that needs building , and children who need rescuing , and as long as a person will not hurt anyone , the community needs him there to help . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they see as undermining the rule of law . " It 's terrible and sad that juries will base their opinions on race bias rather than the facts , but it happens every day , " said Ahmet Hisim , the assistant state 's attorney in Baltimore who lost the Neverdon case . " It 's very bad for justice . " <p> More prevalent than outright jury nullification is the greater tendency of many blacks to believe that police will falsify evidence and lie on the witness stand  --  factors that became major elements in the Simpson case . In this regard , African-American jurors are concentrating on the evidence , but filtering it , as any juror must , through their own perspectives . <p> Robert E. Kalunian , assistant public defender for Los Angeles County , while agreeing that " race does affect jury deliberations , " said : " It 's not just race . It 's life experiences . Blacks are more likely to have been jacked by the police , and less likely to view police testimony with quite the same pristine validity as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , a verdict may stem in part from jurors ' evaluation of the evidence and in part from a broader , racially influenced desire to see certain defendants acquitted because circumstances make a conviction appear unfair to them . <p> This mix seemed to be at play in a gun-possession case in September in the same courthouse where the Simpson trial was in progress . <p> The stakes in the case were particularly high because defendant Byron Carter , 22 years old and black , had two prior convictions , and a conviction here would mean life in prison . Because it was a gun-possession case , the defense appeared to have an instant advantage . Jurors living in dangerous urban areas , recognizing a need to be armed in self-defense , are known to be particularly reluctant to convict for gun possession . Indeed , in the Bronx , 75 percent of such cases end in acquittals . <p> The main issue for the panel  --  five blacks , three Hispanic-Americans , two whites and two Asian-Americans  --  was whether a young , urban black man would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd rather be caught in this neighborhood by the police with a gun than caught otherwise without one . " The two arresting officers , who did n't record the statement or obtain Carter 's signature on a written version of it , claimed he had made the confession after they confronted him in a van that was parked too far away from the curb . <p> Carter testified at trial that he actually said : " Everybody and their mama in this neighborhood got a gun . " But he said he told the police that the weapon in question was n't his . He also said the van was legally parked . <p> All of the black members of the jury immediately agreed that Carter 's version of the statement was more consistent with urban slang than the police 's , which was submitted as part of the alleged confession . After an initial discussion , the first ballot was 10-2 to acquit  --  with only the two Asian-American jurors seeking a conviction . The dissenters ultimately gave in . <p> The jury experience " showed me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Howard Anderson , the black , 34-year-old jury foreman . Jurors without experience dealing with inner-city black defendants " just sit there and look on them as criminals before the trial even starts . "
