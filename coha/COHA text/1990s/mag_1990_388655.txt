We now think he said : " Known ewe taxes . " The AP wire story on Michael Milken , post-sentencing , noted that in the Sixties " he studied arcane business tracts while others marched for civil rights and peace . " So the seeds of villainy were sown ! Meanwhile , thanks to the marchers , we have present-day Detroit and Ho Chi Minh City . You lose some , you lose some . What if we had a recession and no one came ? For months the media and Wall Street have spoken of " the recession " as a fact . And as it happens , newspapers , magazines , television , and Wall Street are in the midst of sharp downturns . But as yet there is no clear sign that the rest of the economy is , or necessarily will be . The economy grew by nearly 2 per cent in the third quarter , and unemployment has stayed in the 5 to 6 per cent band , far below the 9 per cent level reached in 1982 . Gail Fosler , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factors holding the economy up  --  low business inventories , growth in U.S. exports , and the stubborn habits of U.S. consumers  --  as there are negatives holding it down . H. C. Wainwright Economics , a Boston-based consulting firm , is predicting that strength in housing , autos , appliances , and retail sales will propel GNP up by 3 per cent next year , and 4 per cent in 1992 . These are minority views , of course . But so was the belief that we would avoid recession  --  or worse  --  after the 1987 market crash . It may just be that the media are not the real economic message . Irving Kristol has a nice answer to those who say that laws limiting legislators ' time in office will pre- vent them from developing sufficient expertise to deal with the extremely complex nature of modern lawmaking : " It does not seem to occur to these critics that the reason the federal budget covers over a thousand pages in fine print , and that federal regulations constitute a small library , is that so much congressional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congressional interests . " We might also ask : If it takes decades of experience to write the laws , how many years of study does it take to be able to obey them ? Meanwhile , term limitation is going forward on the state level . The current movement is the god- child of , among others , Colorado State Senator Terry Considine , Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum , and Oklahoma businessman Lloyd Noble . These three , sponsors of ballot initiatives that triumphed while the much-hyped " popular " environmental initiatives were going down in flames , are holding a conference in San Jose , California , on December 13 to discuss how to help citizens of other states pass similar laws . Interested parties should contact Mr. Considine , c/o Coloradans to Limit Terms , 1700 Lincoln Street , Suite 220 , Denver , Colorado 80203 , or phone 303-863-9200 . CNN v. Noriega is one of those cases columnists love to expatiate on . It seems prison officials re- corded Noriega 's telephone calls ( a not unprecedented process ) and , presumably thinking that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed the tapes on to the State Department , which shared them with the Panamanian government , where someone leaked them to CNN  --  whether for money or to help Noriega is not known . Then came the restraining order  --  at the request of Noriega 's lawyers , not the Feds  --  which CNN promptly violated . Has Noriega 's right to a fair trial been compromised ? Not that we yet know , since there 's no evidence that prosecutors heard anything relevant  --  though Noriega lawyer Frank Rubino 's discussion of privileged communications with CNN seems a breach of " legal ethics . Do Sixth Amendment rights take precedence over First Amendment ones ? At some point , yes , particularly when confidential material is illegally obtained . Does the press feel any obligation to respect the rule of law , U.S. national security , or the plight of the Panamanian people ? No . ELECTION ADDENDUM : Massachusetts voters were so disenchanted with the status quo that Donna Lambert , a 56-year-old unemployed factory worker living on unemployment compensation of $144 a week , racked up two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic register of probate in Middlesex County , Massachusetts ' largest county . Mrs. Lambert 's campaign cost $600 . Her new job pays $57,000 a year . David Horowitz and Peter Collier , ex-New Left scourges of the Left , have turned their attention to public television . Their Committee on Media Integrity ( Comint ) is off to a promising start in life , nipping at the heels of the Los Angeles public-TV giant KCET . Comint has assailed KCET for declining to run " Fire from the Sun , " a show on fusion energy , on the grounds that it was partly funded by the Department of Energy , while screening " The Abandoned Field  --  Free-Fire Zone , " a made-in-Vietnam piece of propaganda about how the war disrupted the lives of two Vietcong collaborators . Pressure works : KCET dropped South Africa Now , a series that was essentially a mouthpiece for the ANC , though the station denied that Comint had anything to do with its decision . Until such time as Congress cuts public-TV funding entirely ( we do have a budget crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sort are the only way to have an effect . The Corporation for Public Broad- casting bureaucracy , which is supposed to oversee the system , is helpless , while the stations themselves care little about fairness , unless prompted . As long as the system exists , let it have some grass- roots besides left-wing producers and baby-boomers who want to see Hope &; Crosby Road to movies . Mrs. Thatcher has at least succeeded in nominating her successor . John Major , the new prime minister , is nearer to being a Thatcherite than the other two candidates . He is from a humble background ( his father was a jack of several trades , including that of circus acrobat ) ; he has " dry " economic views ; and his rapid rise to the top of the greasy pole only four years after entering the Cabinet was sponsored at each stage by Mrs. Thatcher herself . Will he prove worthy of her patronage ? There are few clues in his personality , which is one of understated niceness . Where Mrs. Thatcher reminds one of Bismarck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a provincial bank manager . His civil servants praise his mastery of their briefs , but he is not famous for any remarks of his own . And ideologically too he is understated , claiming to match his economic liberalism with the social sort . Such signs are not wholly reassuring . Do the British have a Bush on their hands ? Is the heroic age of conservatism dead , as John O'Sullivan asks in " From the Editor " p. 6 ? As Mr. Major might say himself : we must wait and see . Remember the Great Grape Scare last year ? How the FDA claimed to find two cyanide-laced grapes in a whole Chilean boatload , blamed that country , and slapped an embargo on all Chilean fruit ? The embargo cost Chilean growers and exporters upward of $300 million and U.S. importers and retailers at least another $50 million ; not to mention that it sent our supply of ( for us ) out-of-season fruit into the garbage . As if the alleged finding of two barely contaminated grapes in a boatload were n't fishy enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that cyanide , which is volatile and dissipates very quickly , could not have been injected even as late as on the boat . In short , if the two grapes were contaminated at all , it was while they were in FDA hands , whether through simple error or , conceivably , through political activism in the bureaucratic ranks . In either case , the damage was enormous . Some of the injured parties are said to be considering suing  --  though it should n't take lawsuits to keep the FDA from behaving like a tinhorn dictator . Hell hath no fury like an environmental-rights group scorned  --  especially if the malefactor is an- other environmental-rights group . Last month the mighty Greenpeace organization ( Colorado chapter ) , in an attempt to draw attention to the dormant Rocky Flats nuclear-power plant , installed a series of Day-Glo billboards along a section of highway near the site  --  to the disgust of locally based groups known as Citizens against Billboards on Highway 93 . The erstwhile allies are now " nitwits " and " traitors " in each other 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have taken to listing , on bathroom walls , the names of men who are guilty of date rape . But since inclusion in the list is based on one woman 's say-so , not any sort of investigation , and since , as one of the graffitists herself said , " rape " can range from unwanted intercourse to unwanted kissing , men students at Brown have taken umbrage . We say , what did people expect , once college students asserted the right to copulation ? The difference between the " no " that means " no " and the " no " that means " yes " has been known to adulterous fifty-year-olds in French farces for centuries . Now it 's being discovered by teenagers . Welcome to the real world , kids . FLASH : Jimmy Carter has just declined to participate in the Normandy invasion or in any of the fighting in the Pacific war . At a three-day conference at Hofstra University , he told the audience : " I would offer my life to defend my family and country against an invading force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " life to invade someone else 's land . " We hear on good authority that Smith College has prohibited what it is pleased to capitalize as Specific Manifestations of Oppression , one being " Ableism , " which it defines as " oppression of the differently abled by the temporarily abled . " We think the differently abled minds at Smith worry unduly . Their chances of even accidental contact with temporarily abled sanity are remote . Oklahoma voters knowingly , and by a huge margin , re-elected a deceased judge rather than suffer the live candidate . If this practice spreads , we could elect a Congress worthy of the name . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p>
