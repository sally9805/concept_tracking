Can the sun dampen the predicted global warming ? <p> After years spent in a frustrating search , renowned astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini must have wondered if he would die before seeing a legendary sunspot grace the heavens again . These dark blemishes on the surfs face , so common during the days of Cassini 's youth , had virtually disappeared by the time he started observing the sky in the mid-17th century So rare were sunspots , in fact , that any reported sighting caused a celebration among European astronomers of the day . When Cassini finally spied one in 1671 , the editor of the PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON felt obliged to describe the last recorded sighting in 1660 , in case some readers had forgotten what a sunspot was during the intervening years . <p> Today , the idea of partying over a sunspot observation seems ridiculous . When the sun reaches its most active state , every 11 years or so , astronomers can count more than 200 in a single year . Even during the quiet part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface of the sun each year . <p> The dearth of sunspots during Cassini 's time is far from just a footnote to history , for it ties into the hot ' 90s issue of climate change here on Earth . If the cycle of sunspots could change so dramatically since the 17th century , solar scientists wonder , could the sun 's overall brightness wax or wane enough to alter Earth 's climate ? <p> Some skeptics of greenhouse warming push that idea even further , predicting that the sun will weaken significantly in the next century - an effect that would mitigate the predicted global warming caused by greenhouse gas pollution . That idea - voiced in 1989 by the Marshall Institute of Washington , D.C. , a science policy organization - reportedly echoed all the way to the White House , where it fit with the President 's policy of stressing the uncertainties in the climate change arena . <p> All these suggestions , however , inhabit the realm of speculation . Because reliable observations of the sun 's brightness go back only 14 years , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few decades or longer . Yet new studies are beginning to take a more serious look at whether the sun has the muscle to battle the greenhouse warming . <p> " The tendency has been to say that the sun does n't have a role in climate change because there is no information . But there is a hint that the sun does have a role .... I think it 's pretty important to resolve this issue , " says Sallie Baliunas , an astrophysicist at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge , Mass . <p> For the better part of 200 years , theories linking solar variations to conditions on Earth 's surface have bounced in and out of vogue almost as often as necktie fashions . In the middle of this century , solar physicists shied away from this field of research because it still bore a stigma from the days when Charles Greeley Abbot , director of the Smithsonian Institution 's Astrophysical Observatory maintained he could predict the weather at various sites on Earth on the basis of solar variations . <p> " When I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count on one hand the number of solar physicists who were willing to stand up as practitioners of the study of the surfs effect on climate , " says Peter V Foukal of Cambridge ( Mass . ) Research and Instrumentation , Inc . <p> But the black cloud over this field started to fade after solar researcher John A. Eddy published a now famous paper in SCIENCE in 1976 documenting the sunspot drought Cassini had witnessed . <p> Although astronomers had long remarked on the peculiar lack of sunspot sightings in the late 17th and early 18th centuries , many researchers had written this off as a problem stemming from inadequate telescopes . Eddy presented convincing evidence that the 11-year sunspot cycle did indeed die out between 1645 and 1715 - a time he called the Maunder minimum after a 19th-century astronomer who first drew attention to the strange period . Besides sunspot sightings , Eddy also examined records of auroras , the solar corona , and carbon-14 levels stored in tree rings - all of which indicate that the magnetic activity of the sun decreased substantially during this period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth 's climate , many scientists have wondered whether the solar changes in the Maunder minimum altered conditions here on our own planet . After all , this time corresponds to the coldest part of the so-called Little Ice Age , which lasted from the 16th century to the mid-19th century With average global temperatures roughly 1 degree C lower than today 's , the decades of the Maunder minimum were among the coldest periods Earth has seen since the end of the last true ice age 11,000 years ago . <p> A disappearance of sunspots would not in itself exert much effect on the overall warmth of the sun , so it should n't have had a major impact on Earth 's climate . But the sunspot deficiency could have been symptomatic of some change in the surfs total brightness - the so-called solar constant . Eddy suggested that the frigid conditions could have developed if the sun 's total radiation had dimmed by only 1 percent . <p> At the time of his article , Eddy did not know whether the solar constant could change at all . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's overall radiation using instruments on the ground , the measurements lacked sufficient accuracy because Earth 's atmosphere obscures the minute changes that researchers seek . Only satellites could provide a definitive answer . <p> Two years after Eddy 's paper came out , the United States launched the Nimbus 7 satellite , which carried a radiometer that could measure the sun 's brightness from high above the interfering effects of Earth 's atmosphere . Two years later , a second satellite , called the Solar Maximum Mission , went up carrying a radiometer specifically designed to measure total solar irradiance . <p> The satellite data clearly showed the term " solar constant " to be a misnomer : Over a period of a few weeks , the sun 's total brightness varied by as much as 0.2 percent . Yet it took several years before scientists could detect any long-term waxing and waning of the constant . Watching from the peak of the solar cycle in 1980 to the minimum in 1986 , researchers saw the sun 's average brightness drop by 0.1 percent . <p> According to climate theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warming or cooling on Earth . At most , solar variations of that order could change the planet 's average temperature by about O.2 degrees C , says David Rind , a climate modeler at NASA 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City To explain the 1 degree C cooling of the Little Ice Age relative to today , the sun would have to dim by five times the amount seen during the 1980s . <p> To an astronomer like Baliunas , that type of cooling is not out of the question . She and Robert Jastrow of Dartmouth College in Hanover , N.H. , have addressed the solar variability issue indirectly by looking at the behavior of other stars that belong to the same class as the sun . Observations of 13 well-studied solar siblings reveal that the stars split into two distinct groups : the cyclers and the noncyclers . In about twothirds of the sun-like stars , magnetic activity waxes and wanes over a 7- to 15-year cycle very similar to the sunspot cycle of our own sun . The rest of the stars appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Jastrow proposed in the Dec. 6 , 1990 NATURE that an individual star could go through both phases , sometimes cycling and other times not . At present , the sun ranks among the most active of the cycling stars , but Baliunas and Jastrow suggest that in the past it may have spent time as a noncycling star with little magnetic activity According to the researchers , this scenario might explain what happened during the Maunder minimum and other periods of minimum magnetic activity recorded in tree rings and ice cores . <p> If so , the cycles of more distant stars might provide a sense of how much the sun could vary over the long term . " We 've seen changes of up to 0.6 percent in visible light over one cycle , " Baliunas says . " One of the ways to understand those results is to imagine that there is some longer-term change on the sun that is n't uncovered by looking at only one cycle . The other stars can be viewed as random snapshots of some longer-term activity and , in time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Judging from these other stars , Baliunas thinks the sun could brighten or dim by 0.6 percent over a period of several decades to a century If so , the solar changes could give Earth 's climate a considerable push . <p> In the minds of some scientists , there are hints that the sun has nudged the climate during the past century Just as the global average temperature has risen about 0.5 degrees C over this period , the number of sunspots has increased with each cycle . Researchers have long noted this relationship and wondered whether to consider it cause and effect or just coincidence . <p> Last year , two Danish researchers pushed the connection one step further when they compared the length of each sunspot cycle with the average temperature of the northern hemisphere ( SN : 12/7/91 , p. 380 ) . The two curves look astoundingly alike , prompting the researchers to suggest that the global warming over the last century resulted mostly from solar variations rather than from the buildup of greenhouse gases . <p> While that correlation has intrigued researchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence that solar output did indeed change dramatically over this period . " That 's just another one of those mathematical correlations with no physics behind it , " says James Hansen of NASAs Goddard Institute for Space Studies . <p> To show how farfetched correlations could be , Eddy once noted that the period of the Maunder minimum coincided almost exactly with the reign of the Sun King , Louis XIV , who ruled France between 1643 and 1715 . Should one conclude from that correlation that the solar variations produced le Roi Soleil ? <p> From their comparison of the sun with other stars , Baliunas and Jastrow suggest that the sun could dim enough to explain the unusually cold conditions during the peak of the Little Ice Age . Yet not all stars were created equal , and this leads many scientists to question whether the sun behaves just like these other stellar bodies . <p> To address the sun 's potential for change , solar physicist Judith Lean of the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington , D.C. , and her colleagues have looked directly at the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group took an approach that revolves around observations of the sun 's calcium emissions , which relate to the vigor of the magnetic activity on the sun 's surface . <p> This magnetic energy creates many of the patterns that appear on the sun . During times when magnetic disturbances grow stronger , at the peak of the solar cycle , dark sunspots and bright regions called faculae show up on the sun 's surface . In the background , there is an ever-present pattern of bright lines , called the network , that also stems from magnetic activity <p> When sunspots and faculae all but disappeared during the low part of the last solar cycle , total solar radiation dropped by only 0.1 percent . So Lean and her colleagues decided to explore even more dramatic solar changes . How much further would the surfs output dim if the network , as well as sunspots and faculae , vanished ? <p> To test this idea , the researchers used calcium emissions as a poor man 's index of the sun 's total brightness . Because past studies have examined variations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the researchers could calculate how the emissions would dim if they hypothetically removed all the magnetic activity , including the network . In this case , calcium emissions dropped , but not enough to make the sun look like one of the noncycling stars . <p> If Baliunas and Jastrow are correct and the sun really did enter a noncycling mode during the Maunder minimum , then something else must have happened in the sun aside from losing the network . To get the calcium emissions down into the range of emissions from the noncycling stars , Lean and her coworkers determined that the sun 's total face would have to dim substantially - enough to match the darkest one-ninth of the current solar disk . If this were to happen , total solar output would drop about 0.24 percent below its current levels , they report in the Aug. 3 GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS . <p> That may be enough to account for the cooling during the Little Ice Age . Calculations suggest that a dimming of 0.25 percent would chill Earth 's climate by about 0.2 degrees C to 0.6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relative to conditions before the Little Ice Age . <p> But today 's temperatures rest about a full degree higher than those of the Little Ice Age . So despite the correlation found by the Danish workers , the work by Lean and her colleagues suggests the sun could not , on its own , explain all the warming from the Little Ice Age to the present . This finding supports the theory that rising concentrations of greenhouse gases caused much of the climate warming since the late 19th century <p> Lean 's results concerning potential solar behavior also have implications for how the sun may fit in with future global warming . If the sun were to dim by 0.25 percent , it would certainly exert a cooling effect on the climate , but that effect would be a modest one . ' Given our contemporary understanding , the sun is not going to ever vary enough to counter the greenhouse warming ; ' says Lean . Energy calculations as well as sensitivity experiments with general circulation models suggest the sun would have to cool by roughly 2 percent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . <p> Lean and her colleagues readily admit that their work is speculative . " Statistically it 's very difficult because there 's not much information . We put it out as a speculation , as a technique that we could apply to make some estimate of what 's going on , " says one of Lean 's coauthors , Oran White of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder , Colo . <p> But despite the uncertainties in their approach , Lean thinks it offers a more informed picture than less rigorous efforts . As an example of these , she mentions the 1989 Marshall Institute report , which suggested that the sun 's output could change by 0.5 percent . The report also claimed that solar activity should decrease in the 21st century and exert a major cooling force on the climate . Jastrow , who worked with Baliunas on the star comparison study , sits on the board of the Marshall Institute . <p> Lean sees major problems with this analysis . " They were extrapolating in a sort of hand-waving way to say that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that unless you do a proper analysis of the energy output of the sun , which is what prompted us to do this . What we did is put the numbers in , and until you do that , all you can do is hand wave ; " she says . <p> Of course , the best way to learn about solar variations would be to watch the sun to see if it dims or brightens . There are currently several instruments in space capable of measuring total solar output ; the newest of these went up last year on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite . But the next equivalent instrument is not scheduled to fly until early in the next century and researchers who study the sun worry that the current instruments will fail before a new one is in place . <p> To be calibrated , a new instrument must go up before the present ones die . Otherwise , no one will know how the sun changed during the time between measurements , says NASA 's Hansen . <p> Solar scientists have long argued that measurements of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a view that earth scientists have not taken too seriously in the past , says White . But the message has recently started to catch on among a few climate researchers . Hansen , a climate modeler , has played a leading role in this movement and has lobbied NASA to launch a solar monitoring instrument on a small satellite in the next few years , in order to ensure an uninterrupted record . <p> Shelby Tilford , director of NASAs earth sciences division , says a French-Russian satellite scheduled for launch this year or next will carry an instrument capable of monitoring variations in solar brightness . But it is not clear how well this instrument will work or whether the satellite will last beyond a few years . Because of funding limitations , the United States has no plans for launching any such instrument in the 1990s . According to Tilford , " There is a good possibility that there will be a data gap in solar measurements . But that is only one of many data gaps . " <p> Tilford stresses that many issues related to climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe several of these factors will play a greater role in climate change than will solar variations . He mentions clouds , ocean circulation , vegetation , and water vapor as some of the key areas requiring work . <p> Hansen , however , thinks the question of solar variations should come near the top of the priority list . " If you could make only one measurement related to long-term climate , I would say that it should measure the thing that drives the system , and that is the sun . So I think it 's clear it should have a high priority " he says . <p> While the sun could not cancel the warming power of rising greenhouse gas concentrations , Hansen says , " you ca n't disprove that there could be significant variations in the sun that may be an important player in what happens during the next century .
