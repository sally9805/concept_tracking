What are your plans for the economy , and what kinds of foreign companies would you like to see come into or expand in the new South Africa ? We should look into two areas : the development of a manufacturing base and the development of an infrastructure in the country . Our economy has underperformed since 1975 . Growth has been less than the growth of the population . Naturally we require foreign investment . I would not restrict it to any particular kind of company . What we are primarily interested in is development that creates opportunities for employment , because 48% of our people are unemployed . And we are therefore very keen for foreign companies to invest in such a way that there will be a creation of jobs for our people , a generation of wealth . All foreign companies that invest would be guaranteed against expropriation and nationalization . They will be able to recover their profits and dividends  --  all of them . We are guaranteeing every foreign company that invests in our country . Would it be fair and accurate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FOREIGN INVESTMENT ? That is something I have gone out of my way to achieve . I have issued an express invitation to American businessmen to come and invest in our country . So that headline would be accurate . We have said that as soon as a transitional executive council is installed and as soon as a date of election has been fixed , then all financial sanctions should be lifted . We have already agreed on naming a transitional executive council and have set a tentative date for elections  --  April 27 , 1994 . Once that date is confirmed , we will make a call to lift sanctions . There are about 160 U.S. states , counties , and cities that have restrictions on dealing with South Africa . How will you appeal to them ? We have already started a drive to get states and communities that have legislation to consider repealing it . Once the date is firm , we will go full steam ahead and urge them to lift those bans . Should FORTUNE 500 companies start getting ready to invest in South Africa ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FORTUNE 500 , and we would expect them to come in . I went to the U.S. toward the end of 1991  --  to New York , Washington , Pittsburgh , and Atlanta . I invited businessmen in all these places to visit our country , to inspect investment opportunities , because I said a settlement is about to be achieved and we know that you need to do some research before investing . Now I am making that appeal again , and I do hope that by the time companies come it will not be a question of preparing for the future , but that the field will be open . Many U.S , companies sold their operations to South African businesses , Do you want them to return ? Absolutely , that is what we are calling for . As far as we are concerned , the door is wide open . You must understand that part of the violence and instability in this country is due to the fact that there are no job opportunities for our people . Only 3% of those who finished school this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a serious situation , and it can be remedied only by massive investment in our country . That is why we are keen to review sanctions . When the new government is elected , there are bound to be tremendous expectations on the part of people who have been dispossessed and deprived for so long . How can you meet those expectations ? We expect that the Western world will come forward and assist us . When Europe was devastated by the last World War , the Americans realized that they had a duty to help it recover . We are committed to democracy in this country , and in the interest of making democracy take root , we would expect Western democracies to help us with resources , to apply a form of Marshall Plan aid to enable us to meet these expectations . This is one of the things I hope to discuss with President Clinton when I visit Washington . The U.S. is the leader of the democratic world , and we would expect the Americans to lead in this regard . I will be meeting Mr. Clinton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he is a man who will not turn a deaf ear to this appeal . You and your associates have spoken about pursuing an antitrust policy once in office . What would that consist of ? It is a matter of anxiety , or great concern , on our part that more than 86% of the shares on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange are owned and controlled by six conglomerates . We would like to prevent a situation where the market system is so severely curtailed . There should be competition . Our only interest is that there should be free competition , and you ca n't have that when the market is dominated by one monopoly  --  or one group of companies  --  that is so strong that smaller enterprises do not stand a chance . In the U.S. , the telephone monopoly was broken up under pressure from the government . Would you envision that for the six big companies in South Africa ? We would hope that they will unbundle on their own . Although state intervention is something that is known throughout the world , we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some form of intervention may be needed . For example , you have 85% of the population owning only 13% of the land , and a minority of 15% owning 87% . That is something that must be rectified , and state action may be necessary . We could do it without nationalization , without depriving individual owners of their land . There are vast tracts of barren land owned by the SADF South African Defense Forces ! . That is absolutely unnecessary . We will be forming a democratic government that is committed to peace . We do n't need a large army or vast pieces of land . That land can then be made available for individual ownership by people who have been denied that opportunity . It can also be used to address the claims of people who were removed by force and to ensure that there is equitable distribution of land in the country . What other steps can you take ? One thing we will certainly have to do is give people the capacity to take advantage of any schemes for land distribution . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faced with a similar problem when it wanted to help Afrikaners compete against English companies . They created a land bank that gave loans on soft terms to aspirant Afrikaner farmers . Because capital was made available to them , they were able to acquire land and farm . We will have to consider a similar scheme . Are there specific things American companies can do to help , such as selling franchises to black businessmen ? We will have to look into that . Any scheme that will empower blacks will be welcomed , but the exact details would have to be worked out . A big problem is that many of our people do not have the resources to establish businesses . That 's a problem our economists and financiers will have to sit down and address . I am not talking about only ! members of the ANC , I am talking about South Africans who have got the expertise , the skills to know just how to address this matter . A number of American companies  --  Johnson &; Johnson , Colgate-Palmolive , among others  --  stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any penalties against them ? Our whole position is that we should forget the past . Let us concern ourselves with the present and the future . Let us build a new South Africa , where there will be peace and mutual confidence among the various population groups . This is not the time for us to be thinking in terms of revenge , in terms of punishing anybody . We are saying let bygones be bygones . What role do you see for international lending institutions ? We have Peen having discussions with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund . I have the impression that they are willing to come in and help us as soon as we are able to invite them . And I take it that U.S. commercial banks are ready to come as soon as we give the signal that sanctions can be lifted . Given the tremendous competition for investment in the world , why should any business invest in South Africa ? This country is rich in natural resources . We have a wide variety of precious metals , including gold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have been denied the opportunities for education and training . And once these resources have been developed , this place would be a mecca . South Africa can be a powerhouse for Africa , certainly for Africa south of the equator . Is the Western world interested in introducing democratic values in Africa ? It can not be done with Africa in debt and its economy in shambles . South Africa can play a very important role in ensuring economic stability . That is why the West should have an interest in investing here . Are you saying that the new South Africa will have 28 million black consumers who once were unable to buy almost anything ? Undoubtedly . There is a vast potential market , which just needs to be tapped . Is there a role for joint ventures between South African and foreign companies ? Yes , we would welcome that . Are there any sectors of the South African economy that you feel foreign companies should not invest in ? No . Our preoccupation is manufacturing and infrastructure , because these two areas will provide the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? We have many areas where there are no roads , where there are no schools , where there is no electricity , no running water . Infrastructure would also include ambitious housing schemes , because millions of our people are without accommodation . That is why the whole country is littered with what are called squatter camps , informal settlements . How do you spread stock ownership among the people ? Do you see companies distributing shares to employees ? I will not go into detail , but making shares available to everybody would be an important step in giving the people a stake in business . That is a move we will look at . Have you any concluding comments on your dreams for the new South Africa and how business people can help ? We believe in a mixed economy , which is based on private enterprise and which would allow intervention by the state where it is suitable  --  where it is in the interest of the country and its people . In the past you have been called a socialist . Now you seem to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today ? I am neither a capitalist nor a socialist . I am a pragmatist . All that I want is that the living standards of our people be raised . Any strategy that will achieve that objective , I would support . <p>
