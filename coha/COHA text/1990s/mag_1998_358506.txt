We played Lord of the Flies in the remoter woods of Rock Creek Park in Washington . We collected stones in bushel baskets and hid them among the dogwood blossoms . And then , nasty little sociopaths , 10 or 12 years old , we lay in ambush and at the signal hurled rocks full force at our enemies , who were led by the boy with yellow teeth . <P> One day an older boy , who was almost ready to shave , brought a pellet pistol to the war , not a feckless Daisy that would merely sting but a penetrating gas-fired model , almost as wicked as a .22 . <P> That same day , in the midst of battle , I flanked the boy with yellow teeth and sidearmed a perfect strike at his head . I knew I 'd nailed him the instant the rock left my fingers . The missile struck him in the temple , and he clutched his head and fell to his knees , blood gushing through his fingers . I fled in horror , and the war was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pleasure at the perfect bull's-eye I 'd thrown . <P> What if we 'd had automatic rifles ? Would we have used them ? Our violent imaginations were in business for themselves , loose in the wildwood . We had not signed the Geneva convention . We did not desire blood , but we had not thought the play through to consequence ; our fun lay in a kind of self-obliterating game of action and in the glee of power . <P> I do not mean to say , God knows , that boys will be boys . But it is part of childhood to enter into parallel universes of " play " that may be sinister and that may become the more captivating the more it simulates reality . Usually the play , a form of testing and learning , is not fatal . But boys back to the dawn of human experience have had it in their bones to play violent games . Even the priggish Henry Adams , as a boy in the middle of the 19th century , joined the Latin School 's army in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " blackguards from the slums . " <P> It seems grotesque to think of the Jonesboro slaughter in terms of play . But that is a way to approach the otherwise mystifying spectacle of children gunning down children . First of all , play is not necessarily innocent . Nor is childhood . The innocence of children ( which was the unspoken premise of much horrified commentary last week about the Arkansas shootings ) is an adult myth . The reality is children 's extreme vulnerability ; their storms of anger and irrationality and their dramatically imaginative lives , which conjure monsters and heroes and set them in motion  --  whole Iliads . Those imaginations sometimes indulge crazy fantasies of revenge and annihilating vindication . The vulnerability , anger and extreme fantasies of children have been a constant over the centuries , I think . The late 20th century has not reinvented human nature , even though American perfectionism , in league with what is perhaps the amnesia of the dollar people on the subject of human tragedy , may encourage that illusion . <P> The little Arkansas shooters were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington ( me ) who nearly killed the boy with yellow teeth . But some things were different in Jonesboro.
