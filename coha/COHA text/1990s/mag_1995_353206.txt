Once more the globe-trotting peace missionary , Jimmy Carter , has surprised the diplomats . Last week he went to Sudan , where a bloody conflict has long seemed less a civil war than an exercise in mutual extermination , and emerged with the promise of a two-month cease-fire . <P> This Carter achievement seemed particularly startling . For a dozen years , the Muslim Sudanese government in the north and the south 's black Christian and animist rebels have tried to kill as many people on the other side as possible by deliberate starvation and by bombs and bullets . Between them they have snuffed out more than 1.3 million lives . But Carter , in this case as in others , was undaunted , and once more has got results that looked most unlikely : a cease-fire during what is prime season for heavy fighting . <P> As often with Carter 's diplomacy , the long-term value of his intervention is in doubt . " It was negotiated on behalf of the guinea worm , ' ' gibed a State Department official . Indeed , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers to treat a terrible parasitic disease . While the pause might open the door to negotiations , it seems unlikely to end Sudan 's relentless slaughter . Carter did not address the fundamental conflict over the government 's insistence on imposing Islamic law throughout the country . <P> Even so , any break in so murderous a conflict is welcome . And the truce in Sudan well illustrates the strange phenomenon of Carter diplomacy . This time , at least , nobody is likely to denounce it as an unconscionable bribe to an outlaw state , as some did the North Korean agreement Carter got started last June  --  or as helping to legitimize a band of killers , the view some took of the cease-fire he brokered in Bosnia in December . Nor will he be accused of undermining official U.S. policy , a charge still heard six months after his last-minute success in paving the way for a peaceful landing of U.S. troops in Haiti . <P> But it does raise anew the oddly unnerving specter of Carter , in his sensible shoes and armor of self-righteousness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How does this private citizen , whose own presidency sank under accusations of weakness and appeasement , manage to make himself a force in world diplomacy ? <P> To begin with , there is the role of the Carter Center in Atlanta , which has some 200 employees working on projects around the world full time . The former President will not use the words " mini-State Department " to describe his operation . But he does say , " We analyze the major conflicts of the world . So if we get an unexpected opportunity to deal with a problem , we do n't have to start from scratch . In a few hours , I can have on my desk here a fairly sophisticated briefing .
