A duppy by default , he was drowned , but he came out of the sea . Never dead , he said , though who would believe him ? Life raft , he explained , but his employers-a graying pair , nondescript Anglicans who already spoke of the Will of God to describe his disappearance-now spoke of that same Will to describe his appearance . He was an unlikely , sunburnt ghost , white-teethed and islandbred . At the request of the local clerics-and for the general benefit of the public-he was installed on a stool and behind a bottle at the Breadfruit Bar . The whole arrangement-bar , stool , man , bottle , beer-sat on Farhall Street . By day , the Breadfruit was a failing bar , an eye in the storm of activity of the street . By nightwho knew ? The place had a reputation , and each evening , it earned its changeable identity , only to be scrubbed clean in the morning of peanut shells and beer , events and personality . <p> Charlotte was standing in the airport customs line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She craned her head back to eavesdrop on two women , huskily whispering about a man who spent his evenings laying hands on the ill and blessing children . Apparently , he would tell the story of his life , his time at sea , only if you told your own story , whatever that might be , first . He accepted payment in cigarettes and liquor and an occasional flying fish sandwich . <p> Charlotte turned to hear more , but the speaker gave her a look , blank with hostility , so she swiveled her head back around , pretended to be deeply engaged in a " You Are Welcome to Barbados-Drugs Are Not " sign . <p> Later , Charlotte 's youthful cabdriver continued the story . " The ghost 's age , " he started . No one could guess what it was , though his parents , or so the reports went , had specific numbers to offer . He seemed to be , alternately , craggy sage or soft-lipped infant , and sometimes both at once . If you slit your thumb open on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisp of the tobacco smoke he blew from his mouth . <p> Charlotte , already wilting in the day 's soggy heat , nodded at this . Around her , the island sped by : coconut palms , bamboo , hibiscus . She could n't name the other trees : one covered with gaudy orange-red blooms , another dark and wispy , smudged against the sky like a charcoal drawing . There were goats tethered to posts , cement-block homes painted pink , turquoise , or peach but weathered into colorlessness , the flat hue of decay . Everywhere , rusted galvanized tin was pieced together to form crooked backyard fences , and there were bars-really no more than shacks built over counters-with reveal-nothing names like " Hideaway " or " T &P."; And churches , of course . Moravian . Church of Christ . United Church of Holy America . Salvation Army . <p> The road the cab was on narrowed and angled towards the water . The first sight of it was a shock , such a vibrant turquoise , and Charlotte allowed herself a pointless exclamation : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pause in which the driver waited to hear more . Charlotte offered the required sentence : " It 's beautiful . " And it was , though otherwise the landscape-both Third World and all too familiar-disappointed . The taxi passed two strip malls , filled , as malls with sixties and seventies architecture were invariably filled , with unglamorous banks and laundromats . The street 's gutters were rivulets of papery trash , highlighted with the signature yellow of M &M; wrappers . <p> At a stoplight , three bare-chested men , wearing crocheted wool caps , puffy as popovers , crossed in front of the cab . " Hey , " one waved to the driver . " Hey . " The driver stuck his arm out to grip his friend 's hand . <p> " I tellin ' her ' bout da duppy . " The driver gestured with his thumb to Charlotte . " What duppy ? " <p> " Ah , you doan know , mahn ? " the driver said , but the light changed color , and he had to wave goodbye without enlightening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange was meant to mock her in some obscure way . The pure embarrassment of being white , Charlotte thought , especially here , where it was clear white people were tourists and black people had real lives . <p> " You doan believe me ' bout da ghost . " The cabdriver laughed . " Da ghost a Bridgetown . " <p> Charlotte was about to answer , " Sure I do , " when he interrupted to say , " But issa fact . " At least , he reported , it was what everyone was saying , and they were saying it often and loudly <p> Charlotte smiled and sunk deeper into her seat , hugged her arms , as if that might hide her skin color from the general observer . " I 'm here on business , " she wanted to announce . And it was true : she was using her art history background to do some research for Howard , her lawyer-grandfather , trying to help him settle a repatriation dispute about a menorah . It was unclear to whom it should be returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originally fashioned the piece . But Charlotte 's true purpose hardly mattered ; she 'd have said anything to convince the driver she was n't who he took her to be . " For Christ 's sake , why do you care ? " she could hear her sister , Helen , say . And she 'd be right to ask . This desire to be above reproach was dumb for a thousand reasons . But even Helen-breezy , loud-mouthed Helen-had felt it . Just four months ago , in the hospital , at the end , she 'd said to their mother , " But I 'm a good girl , are n't I ? Are n't I ? " <p> Inside the Hilton , Charlotte 's room-pleasantly cool with airconditioning-was standard issue with a few tropical touches : a bamboo headboard on the bed , a gift basket of fruit on the dresser , a sliding glass door that opened onto a small concrete patio , overlooking a white , spacious beach . Below , black women wearing brightly colored headdresses dunked themselves into the sea . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were actually baptizing one another . As a girl , Charlotte had been on family vacations that seemed to require the same false cheer as this hotel . Disneyland , she remembered , had made her sick with grief , a guilty depression padded after her as she shook Pluto 's hand and pretended to enjoy riding a dumb little boat through a world of singing dolls . The only fantasy that could engage her was of working at Disneyland , sitting in an overheated booth and dispensing tickets . Even now , only work-or the illusion of itappealed , so she stepped back out of her room with a self-imposed assignment : She would find the synagogue before dark . <p> She walked , along the crumbling edge of a road , into Bridgetown . Narrow , toy-like cars chugged past her . At intervals , a white van-some sort of bus ? - gave a double-noted beep , and a black man , early twenties at the oldest , emerged from a passenger-side window to make a " Ride ? " gesture with his forefinger . She shook her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The heat only increased with her distance from the hotel . After ten minutes , her clothes-none too roomy in the first place-were slicked to her . And what with the sunscreen she 'd slathered over herself , she felt filthy . She 'd had sun poisoning as a teenager , spent a full week before college lying on the cool tiles of her family 's bathroom , rising only to vomit or gross her sister out with the large pieces of tissue she pulled from her back . An experience she did n't intend to repeat , so even with the sunscreen on , she darted from one side of the street to the other , keeping , best as she could , to the shade from the second-floor porches that hung over the narrow sidewalks . Occasionally one of the buildings would open on a small market , selling little more than soda and chips , but most of the places she passed were sealed up . On the buildings ' second floors , signs stuck out like file-folder tabs : Bayview Jazz , The Club , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the street would be hopping . " Do n't , " the hotel 's desk clerk had warned her , " walk back here at night . " And Charlotte saw how what was now harmless could feel seedy without sunshine : something about the slight sag of the buildings and the semi-secrecy of an upstairs club , the vague feeling that what really went on here happened in places that were hard to find-there being no clear map to the illicit . <p> Eventually , she came to a harbor and then a bridge , which led to the rush of activity that was the city : New York 's 14th Street meets the tropics meets St. Moritz . She passed a glittery watch store , then an alley littered with cardboard boxes and coconut husks , only to run into two schoolgirls , neatly dressed in their pretty blue pinafores , looking into the window of House of Deals . A familiar , greasy smell wafted past her . A Kentucky Fried Chicken . She was ambling , but heading-more or less-toward the synagogue , though the building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask for directions . " What you like ? " prompted the vendor . <p> " Oh , nothing , nothing , " Charlotte said , " but ... " She held out her map . " Can you tell me where this is ? " " You 're right there . " <p> " Really ? " Charlotte looked around . " Do you know where the synagogue is ? " " The what ? " <p> " A ... " Charlotte stopped . Suddenly " synagogue " seemed like the most exotic word in the world . " A temple . You know , like a church for Jewish people ? " <p> The man shrugged but kept smiling at her in a vaguely lascivious way . <p> " Hmm , " Charlotte said and pulled her top from her sweaty chest . " It 's supposed to be around here somewhere . Well , never mind ; she chirped , happy to wander farther if it would remove her from the man 's stare . <p> Charlotte was soon lost again . Not that she did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . And according to her map , she should have been within arm 's reach of a stack of yarmulkes , kissing distance from a Torah . But she was n't . <p> Of course , Howard might just have neglected to tell her that this particular synagogue was invisible . As a girl , Charlotte had had a recurring dream about an invisible clubhouse , a place that only revealed itself once you went inside , but then you discovered it was n't a place where you wanted to be ; it was strewn with the remnants of a desperate fight , clothes and broken furniture and , most horribly , a chunk of someone 's hair with a bit of the scalp still attached . <p> " Miss , " a voice called as Charlotte stepped off the curb . Charlotte turned to see a straggly fellow with one of those nevertrimmed beards that makes a man look insane . Was he talking to her ? Apparently sensing an opportunity in her hesitation , the man rocked forward , like a clown punching balloon . " Can I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I 'm sorry . " Charlotte turned abruptly and crossed the street but the man followed , coming right up to her ear and pleading , like any disappointed child , " Please . Please . Pllleaasse . " He was so close , a drop of his spit landed in her ear . Charlotte stopped short , slapped at her ear , and said , firmly , both words quick and hard , " Sir , no , " before she continued on . <p> Behind her , the man whined , in a hurt , baby voice , " You do n't have to be so sell-fish . " <p> At a different point in her life , Charlotte might have considered the charge , but now she turned and said , " You do n't know anything about my life . So fuck off , mister . " But the man was already out of earshot . <p> A vendor , sitting in a sagging lawn chair , under a blue umbrella and beside a cart lined with plastic syrup bottles , looked up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad man . These people , " he gestured with his chin in the direction of the beggar , " there 's a greediness to them . They eat too much and beg too much . Just enjoy yourself . Enjoy your time in Barbados : ' <p> Charlotte flushed . This was somehow worse than the beggar . " Okay , " she said , " I 'm sorry , " and hurried away . Back on Broad Street , the city 's narrow main thoroughfare , she stopped for juice in a tiny , overly air-conditioned mall . Inside , a line of men were waiting to play something that looked like the Lotto . Her creepy drink in hand-sorrel juice , she should n't have experimented again-she sat down on a sticky bench and studied her map , trying to figure out where she 'd been . Her eye settled on a street name . Farhall . Why was that so familiar ? A cigar brand ? But then she remembered : the street which housed the Breadfruit , the bar which claimed the duppy each night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandon the search for the synagogue and pay a visit ? <p> True , Charlotte was n't a believer , never had been , but ghosts . They . . . attracted her . Or , belief in ghosts did . What enticed her was the metaphysics of the matter . Would n't it change your sense of what death was ? And why did n't people ever talk about that ? <p> Charlotte shivered . It was freezing in this tiny mall . Her juice was repulsively cold . She looked for a place to toss it , but there were no bathrooms anywhere , so she placed the full cup on top of a garbage can . As she turned to leave , a young man called something at her . <p> " What ? " Charlotte said . <p> The man stepped closer to repeat himself . It was the beggar from before ! He brought his face so near Charlotte thought he might kiss her . She jumped back . His lips were chapped and bleeding . Was he reproving her for buying a juice , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him her change ? " Do n't be scared of Barbados , " he laughed , darting his face towards her again . <p> " I 'm not , " she said , jerking her head back and walking purposefully out the door and into the early evening warmth , a comfortable blanket after the chill of the air-conditioning . Everyone , she thought foolishly , as if a horde had just descended on her , leave me alone . She was on the edge of tears , not because the fright from the man had been so serious , but because she felt dreadful for still being capable of fear . The worst had already happened . What right did she have to flinch at anything else ? <p> The sun was starting to lower . Charlotte checked her watch . It was only 5:20 . Back home , it would n't darken for hours . So Farhall . Charlotte did n't need to believe the duppy story to check it out . No one else seemed to . Rumors , rumors : they entertained but did n't persuade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these first few hours meandering the streets , Charlotte saw that there was a reserve to people here . They did n't meet your eyes , and the evidence of those to whom she had talked aside , they seemed to have the kind of British propriety that Charlotte associated with the eminently sensible . Still , she could n't help but want to find the people who were n't , those who really did believe , even if they were , like palm readers in Manhattan , a slub in the regular fabric of island life . <p> She pushed down the street , past " Amen Alley , " a tiny passage , cut off from the light of day . Charlotte could just make out two men filleting fleshy fish on a lopsided wooden table . The image pleased her into wishing she was the woman waiting to receive those fillets , to fry them up . A simple dinner , the end to a simple day . But then a spider hit her arm , and its frantic scramble as she brushed it away depressed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise there , but still , she did n't want to be reminded . Only last night , while she was half-watching late-night TV , the hysterical cowering of some bad guy in front of a gun made her feel like disintegrating . <p> The streets led to increasingly narrow roads till she came to Farhall . She walked the length of it , but no Breadfruit Bar appeared . How irritating to be stumped , twice in one day . But she was also relieved . The city 's atmosphere had changed perceptibly in the last half hour : things closing up , groups of men clustering around sidewalk domino games . And all the stores , as if by some agreement with the hour , seemed to have become betting places or bars , each an entirely male province . She could hardly imagine entering one . But then , as she was turning for the harbor , she looked down an alley and saw a pile of sand . So the bar was on Farhall , but on the alley side of the street . <p> Earlier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locals came with plastic buckets and created a virtual sandbox in front of the Breadfruit 's door . A duppy , he explained , would n't enter a building without first counting all the grains of sand at the door , and , math whiz or no , your average duppy could n't do that before daybreak , the hour when all duppies are due back at their graves . But the ghost of Bridgetown. . . apparently , he had n't so much as flinched at the sand . He 'd stepped right over the pile and into the bar . He 'd ordered himself a beer and insisted , once again , that he 'd never died . <p> Charlotte hesitated before entering the alley ; it felt too private , like someone 's backyard , though halfway down , there was an " Open " sign poking out like the flag on a trick gun . Below it , a child 's shovel , fluorescent pink , was upended in the ineffectual sand hill . The toy gave Charlotte courage , but then at the bar door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be around ? And what did she want from him , anyway ? Some confirmation that her skepticism was faulty , that death was a pleasure , and that the community of the dead was so chummy that when he returned to the grave , he 'd be able to greet Helen ? Stupid , Charlotte thought , and yet she peeked into the bar with something close to expectation . <p> It was a single room , unadorned , save for a handful of wooden tables to the right and a bar to the left . It did n't seem to be a frightening place , which is to say it looked more like a sandwich shop than a place for hard drinkers , honeymooners , or men on the make . At one table , two women fanned their babies with menus . <p> Charlotte pulled a Time magazine out of her bag , thinking she 'd pretend to read while she eavesdropped , but she did n't have to wait long for information . <p> " It 's the duppy , " the bartender said as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gestured to the room 's only other white person , a man sitting two stools away . <p> " Oh , really ? " Charlotte lifted the damp hair from the back of her neck . Above , a ceiling fan creaked noisily but offered no real relief . <p> Next to the white man , a patron with a closely cropped beard , linen pants , and narrow red suspenders leaned back on his stool to call over to Charlotte , " He 's no duppy . " The white man reached up to pluck at one of the red suspenders , as if it were a bass string . " Sit down , Greg , " the white man said cheerfully . " Sit down and shut up . " He rolled his eyes at Charlotte , as if she were in on the joke of Greg . <p> Charlotte smiled and looked back at her magazine . Greg came over to see what she was reading . " News , " he said dismissively . " I 'm a reporter , " he added , swallowing a burp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret . I 'll give you a lead . Here 's news . " He pointed at the white man . " It 's the Will of God . " He laughed once derisively . " Just call me Will " the white man said , rolling his eyes once again , as if he 'd already identified Charlotte as someone who could appreciate foolishness , without engaging in it . <p> " Will . Hi . ' Charlotte turned to the bartender . " Could I get a . . . ? " she pointed to a glass of whiskey someone had abandoned at the bar , and he nodded . <p> She tried to take Will in without appearing to look . There was a delicate roundness to his face , a cap of dark hair . He was a handsome man . . . almost pretty in that long-eyelashed , slim-bodied way that some men had . " You 're ? " he asked . <p> " Oh , sorry , " she said , as if waking from a doze . " I 'm Charlotte . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the reporter at his right , " and Winston , " gesturing to a third man , silent all this while , sitting next to Greg . Charlotte nodded a hello . Greg offered a goofy , absentminded grin , but Winston did nothing . Reserve or hostility ? Charlotte could n't read his studious silence , so at odds with his dress : black pants and vest , a white shirt open to just above the navel . He seemed about Will 's age-somewhere in his twenties . Greg had to be older . The hairs at the bottom of his beard had begun to whiten . He almost looked like an elf who 'd dipped his chin in a vat of milk . <p> " What you looking at ? " Greg barked at her , his fingers playing quick little trills on the bartop as he waited for an answer . The question did n't seem rude , exactly , but some mixture of authoritative-he knew what was going on-and ironic-he knew what he thought about what was going on . <p> " Nothing , " Charlotte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several quick sips of her drink . <p> She glanced down at her magazine then back up at Will . It seemed clear that all the stories about the duppy were a joke . Anyone could see he was no sage . He was a kid , despite the patch of hair thinning in the back and the high rise of skin at his temples . She guessed he was a fisherman or a day laborer , because he had the body for it and also the clothes , the nondescript blue jeans with the plain blue shirt . <p> " Yes , I heard you were a duppy ; " Charlotte offered tentatively . She still was n't sure she wanted to get drawn into conversation . " But you look-what can I say ? decidedly corporeal to me . " <p> " It 's a case of mistaken identity , " Will shrugged and slipped a cigarette out from the cuff of his shirt . " Like one ? They 're wrinkled , but . . " He palmed one over . <p> She took it but said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and turned the cigarette over , tapped the wood of the bar with it . Her head hurt slightly from the day 's sun , and she felt a little odd , as if she were playing at being sophisticated . <p> " Okay . " He reached over to take the cigarette back , carefully returning it to his shirt 's sleeve . Charlotte thought of someone replacing a vein . He was Frankenstein , building himself up after a temporary loss of a part . <p> Charlotte could n't figure out where to put her eyes , so she looked back down at her magazine , tried to find a hard-news article to read , though normally she worked her way from the gossip through the arts before pushing herself through the economic and political news . It would help if she had a man with her . He 'd be like protection , declaring her interest to be decidedly nonsexual , though , in fact , Will had the manner and look of the men on whom she always had crushes . " Working-class heroes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Charlotte , who was so clearly an urban intellectual , destined for the professions . <p> " Hey , " Greg shouted , and Charlotte looked over , as if he were going to reprove her again for staring , but his words were directed elsewhere-at a second white man , just entering the bar . The newcomer sported a broad-brimmed cowboy hat and a leisure suit jacket , both a pale eggshell brown . He had a substantial " generosity , " Helen and Charlotte 's term for the prominent belly that some men wore like a pillow strapped under their belts . For some reason , this particular distribution of fat always seemed arrogant to Charlotte , though she knew that was n't fair . " Hi , all , " the man said . <p> From Texas , Charlotte decided . There was a slight twang to his voice . The man called out to Will . " So you 're back from converting the heathen . " <p> " You know I was just along for the ride , " Will said . He used the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other , cracking each knuckle along the way . " Nothing wrong with a little gainful employment . " He turned to Charlotte and explained , " I was a cook on a charter boat . I had a little accident , and now I 'm okay . That 's why everyone 's saying I 'm a duppy . " <p> " Where are they ? " Charlotte said . " I mean , the people from the boat . " <p> " Oh , other side of the island . They put in a call . Glad to hear you 're alive , ' and so on . " But you 've seen them ? " <p> " No , " Will said . " I 've only been back for a couple of weeks . " " I 'm sorry , " Charlotte said . " What 's to be sorry about ? " <p> Charlotte shook her head . He seemed , suddenly , very young to her , perhaps because he appeared so unaffected by his brush with death . It made her think she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Hey , ' Will started , as if something had just occurred to him . " Do you play poker ? " " Sometimes . " <p> " Fantastic , then we 've got a game , " he announced to the men surrounding him . <p> " Let 's do it . " Greg slapped the bar then stepped unsteadily to the back of the room . Charlotte watched him disappear through a wood door . <p> " We were going to play , " Will explained to Charlotte , almost apologetically . There was something odd about the way he was talking to her , as if she were n't a stranger , but someone whom he had in his care for the evening . " We set up a little table on the patio . ' He cocked his head toward the door . " Oh , " Charlotte began , gripping her magazine to indicate that it was something she needed to get back to , " I 'm not much of a card shark . " <p> " Why do n't you play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting , and we 'd never forgive ourselves if we left you to these jokers . " His head jerked back . " You can quit whenever you want . " <p> Charlotte considered this for a moment . She had come for Will 's story , yet here she was hesitating . For a brief while in college , she had thought she 'd be a journalist , but it was this very sort of timidity that stopped her . She knew she 'd always be too frightened to get the scoop . But what was there really to be frightened of here ? Or anywhere ? she reminded herself , thinking of the man with the bleeding lips and then of Helen , lying in the ICU and noticing , for the first time , a huge bloody bruise that had been on her arm for days . She 'd jumped when she 'd seen it , startled by how painful it looked , then nodded back into sleep . " Okay , " Charlotte said . Perhaps she had decided too hastily that there was nothing to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untrustworthy ? And anyway , it was n't late . She could play a few hands without destroying her plans for the evening-which were , essentially , to sleep , so she could get an early start tomorrow . " Why not ? " <p> Out on the patio , Greg was turning over a bucket to use as a table . He could have dragged in any one of the tables from the barroom floor , but , Charlotte supposed , this made the gathered feel makeshift and grubby in a way that proved they were men , stubborn people with no use for arrangements . Card sharks . . . no less skillful and conniving for the sandwich-shop atmosphere , the lushness of the vegetation growing by the peach-colored patio walls . <p> " Let 's leave this open , " she said and slid a rock under the door to the bar . If she was going to be the only woman on the patio , she wanted easy access to those inside , particularly the middle-aged mothers rolling dewy Coke bottles over their foreheads , the ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greenbay Moravian Church . " <p> Silent Winston and the man in the hat stepped onto the patio . " This is Edward , " Will said . The man in the hat gave a half-bow . " What this ? " Winston pointed his chin at Charlotte . " I do n't want none of this . " <p> " Put a cork in it , " Edward snapped , his Texas twang even more pronounced than before . " Put a couple corks in it . " " I do n't want none of you no neither , brother . " Charlotte looked at Will , but he was busying himself with the poker chips . Charlotte supposed she should get angry , not on behalf of herself , but on behalf of her sex , but she did n't feel like a worthwhile representative of her sex at the moment . She was n't very good at cards . She was n't going to upset all stereotypes about women with her hard-assed poker game . " Do n't pay him no mind , " Greg said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will suggested , almost sweetly . " What do you think , Winston ? " <p> " ' Kay , " Winston said sullenly and slid into one of the five chairs that Greg had drawn up to the bucket . " ' Cause she friends with the duppy . " <p> " He is n't a fuckin ' duppy , " Greg said . <p> " Thank you , " Charlotte offered , ingratiatingly . She could feel herself focusing on Winston . She always wanted to win over people who did n't like her . <p> " Cut , " Winston said and placed the pack of cards in front of her . Charlotte took the chair opposite him and did as he said . Winston leaned back and ran his fingers along a gold chain that he had fished out from under his white shirt . <p> " Let me sit by the lady , " Edward insisted and installed himself between Charlotte and Greg . At her right , Will smiled . It was a suspicious smile , and Charlotte suddenly wondered if she 'd been drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was n't like they were going to get any money out of her . She was a conservative player . She 'd fold if she did n't think she could win . <p> Will started dealing the cards , quickly shooting them into five stacks . <p> " Let 's see , let 's see , " he said . " Seven-card stud . High-low . Deuces wild . " <p> " This a joke ? " Winston snapped . " No joke , sir . " <p> " The woman , and now this- " <p> " He thinks , " Greg said , apparently by way of explanation for Will , " the wild-card crap is for sissies . " <p> Winston gave him a long look and said flatly , " He read da mind . " <p> " My deal . We 'll play my way . Your deal , we 'll play yours . How 's that ? " Will said . <p> Winston shook his head and looked at the floor , mumbled , " Some duppies is rude , mahn . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I give the sun only about ten more minutes till it completely disappears . " He gave an appraising glance up at the square patch , the blue-gray ceiling , that capped the patio . " So , let 's go . " <p> As they played , Will talked up the hand . " Looking like two sweet cousins , two jack of all trades for my friend here , " he chimed once Greg had two face cards up . And later : " Those cousins still leading . You going to make your bet ? " <p> " Yeah , " Greg said and lit up a cigarette . The chips went in , clink , clink , clink . Charlotte was used to playing for peanut M &Ms; with Helen and her parents , back when she was a kid , and always stayed in the game , if only to be a good sport , to make it more fun ; back when the loser was n't the worst player but the person who could n't keep from eating the profits . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlotte said as Will gave her the pack of cards . Her deal . " It 'll be five-card draw . " " No fun , " said Will . <p> Winston just snorted , and Edward said , " That 's the way . " Charlotte shuffled clumsily . When she was ten , it had been enough to simply scramble the cards all over the table then gather them up . <p> " Look at that , " Edward said now as she awkwardly smashed the two halves of the deck together . <p> " I know , I know , " Charlotte nodded . " Let 's see . . . most people could do it better with one hand , right ? Most people could do it better with two feet ? How 's that ? " <p> " Could n't have said it better myself , " Edward allowed . <p> Charlotte took a sip of her drink . She was a little drunk and grateful for the feeling . Already she could hear herself , back home , at some party , bragging about joining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few hands in relative silence . When there was conversation , it focused on the game . Finally , a gap-toothed woman with the round , too-large head of an infant came out and placed a large candle on the ground by the bucket . Ominous shadows licked Will 's face . " Ah , I can see the cards now , " he smiled at the woman . A spidery blood clot floated in the white of her right eye . <p> " I 'll sit out a few hands , " Charlotte said , and when no one acknowledged her words , added , " I need another drink . " She could see it was the only acceptable explanation for getting up . Inside , she paid the bartender and asked , " How do I get a cab ? " <p> " Oh , " he said , waving his hand , " no trouble . I call you one . " He said he 'd let her know when it came . <p> Back outside , in the candlelight of the patio , Charlotte tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men hoot with laughter . <p> " She keepa da straight face , " Winston punched Will to say . <p> " Oh , shut up , " she said , exasperated . <p> This was even funnier . " She tell me to shut up da mouth . " Charlotte brushed a fly from her ear . All she could think about was how wonderful a bath would be . She tried to focus back in on the game . Who was winning ? Who losing ? she wondered with little real concern , then a pattern seemed to be developing . She got interested . Was it or was it not true that Will won every hand he dealt ? Surely , Charlotte could n't be the only one who noticed this . <p> " What you want ? " Winston suddenly demanded . <p> " What ? " Greg said . <p> " Drink , " Winston spit . <p> Greg tapped his temple and said , " Okay . Okay . I 'm drinking gin . " He palmed over a large bill . <p> Winston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he seemed to have a fascination with making sure everyone else had what they needed . <p> " You ? " Winston asked Charlotte . It was the first time he 'd spoken directly to her . <p> " I 'm through for the night , " she said . <p> " I 'll come with . " Greg stood . <p> " Yeah , Winston ca n't be trusted with change when he 's losing , " Edward said and followed the other two men into the bar . Will pushed his chair toward Charlotte 's . The inside of his knee knocked against hers . Accident or not ? she wondered and left her knee pressing his . Her cab would be here soon . She could do what she wanted . <p> " Let me teach you something while they 're gone , " he said conspiratorially . Charlotte thought she 'd like him better if he faltered a bit when he spoke , if his hair were longer and fell sloppily in his eyes . <p> " I know how to play , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He shuffled the deck slowly <p> " I just have bad luck . " It was true ; she never won at games of chance . <p> " And I . . . , " he fingered the deck , " have good luck . " <p> " I do n't need your kind of luck , thank you ; ' Charlotte said . <p> " What 's that supposed to mean ? " <p> " Nothing , " Charlotte breathed softly , willing herself all the courage to spit out the word cheat . <p> " Do n't you believe in luck ? " he said . <p> " No , I guess not . Not really . Unless it 's bad . " She laughed , though she was thinking that she reminded herself of the sort of cynical women who sit late at bars , talking of old husbands , old hurts , who sit and lick their wounds . A contest . Whose wounds went deeper ? Who could add cancers and rapes , muggings and untimely deaths , peculiar accidents , exploding pumpkins and crazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlotte had never met a woman like this . And yet she was driven in fear of becoming one . The whole cartoon catalogue : shrying bitch , whore , ice cube , prima donna , just-one-of-the-guys girls , fag hag . Stupid terms , all of them . She knew that , but it did n't matter . <p> " No , no , I 'm serious , " Will was saying . Where was her cab ? " I 'm talking about luck . Do you or do n't you believe in it ? " Charlotte shrugged . Maybe this was what she 'd come for . <p> " It 's a matter of concentration . Let me tell you a story . When I was a kid , I could fix broken clocks . All sorts of clocks . Grandfather , cuckoo . I 'd just concentrate and . . . there it was . One day , I 'm sitting in the back seat of my dad 's car . He 's driving around with this lady in the front . I still do n't know who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper bag that we 're taking over to the Salvation Army . " <p> Charlotte wondered for a moment what it could possibly be like to have a childhood on this island . " I 'm thinking , Sure , we 'll have to fix it right up or the army wo n't want us . " ' He laughed . " I do n't know what I was thinking . I was a kid . So , I set to thinking about fixing that thing , and soon enough , there 's a tic-tic sound along with the steady hum of the motor , and this woman in the front starts screaming , What 're you doing ? What 're you doing ? How 'd you do that ? ' And then I see that what I 've done is out of the ordinary , and that very knowledge . . . it 's like a loss of innocence , if you see what I mean . I could n't do it anymore . " <p> Charlotte nodded . What she thought was Simpleton , but what she said was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't you ? " <p> " Well , I- " she hesitated . " I guess I do n't . But I believe that you believe . " <p> " Oh , well , that 's flattering : ' He pushed his chair back a few inches . Charlotte looked down at her hands . " Well , " Will leaned forward again , " do n't you believe that there are things we humans do n't know about ? " <p> " Of course . " Charlotte straightened up in her chair . Here it was . The other person acted stupid , you acted smart . They acted smart , you fairly drooled a reply . Ca n't have two people in power . Everyone knew that . Also , ca n't have two people out of power . . . a lesser-known fact . " Obviously , I know we 're limited by our way of perceiving the world . We 've only got our eyes and ears and hands to go by , and , who knows , if we had something else , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing outside even our limited notions of worlds or . " Now she was getting lost in her own thought ; she tried to start again . " If we did n't need our bodies to receive all this data for us- " <p> " I did n't go to college , " Will interrupted . " What I 'm asking is , " he paused , " do n't you think there are unspoken forces ? " Charlotte felt a sudden panic . What she thought was : He 's asking me to go to bed . But , then , that seemed ridiculous . Before she answered , she twisted her long hair into a rope and pulled it across one shoulder . Was she neatening herself up for him ? " I do n't think you can make a clock work by concentrating . . . or win poker , for that matter . " " But , come on . Do n't you think sometime , there 's just this thing- " Will looked up and searched the sky , now freckled with the night 's first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he was looking . <p> " I 'm sorry , " Charlotte said , and she was , sorry she could n't agree with him or pretend to agree . His enthusiasm , his desperation for convincing her . . . there was all that to appreciate . And if she could honestly assent , the world would n't be what she thought it was ; Helen would be , somehow , okay , deeply okay . She 'd be in the afterworld , having a ball with all the virtuous dead : her grandparents and a childhood friend who 'd died of leukemia . But who could buy this ? " Come on , " Will whispered . <p> " Let 's stop this , " Charlotte said , almost frightened . " No , wait . " His chair screeched against the floor as he moved it nearer again . " Do n't you believe that there are forces between people ? Do n't you ? And you ca n't see them ? And you ca n't hear them , but they can make things happen ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Emotions are n't magic , " she said flatly . <p> " So , you do admit it , that there 's something there ? " Please , she thought , please . If he went just a bit further , she thought she 'd cry . <p> " Or maybe you do n't believe in it ? " <p> Love , she thought he meant now . It was hard to hold on to what they were talking about . Passion . Or maybe you 're one of them . Senseless virgins . . . that 's what she 'd have to avoid seeming like now . <p> " Do n't you believe in that ? Do n't you ? " he whispered one final time , then snapped his back into his chair . Winston , Edward , and Greg had returned . <p> Charlotte pulled at the skin of her lower lip . He was saying , Do n't you believe in love ? And passion ? Do n't you ? Or maybe you believe I did n't fix that clock in that car ? But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Havisham , Faulkner 's Rosa Caufield . Or a believer . There was no in-between . " A cab came for you , " Edward said . " Oh , " Charlotte started to stand . <p> " Sit , sit . " Winston patted the air , as if it contained an imaginary dog . We told it to come back later , ' Edward said innocently . There was no apparent sense , on his part , that this might be read as a hostile , even threatening action . " I need to go , " Charlotte said but did n't stand . " No trouble , " Winston said . <p> " It 'll come back , " Edward coughed . " When the game 's over . " He placed a whiskey in front of her . " For you . It 's on me . " " God , " Charlotte said . " What time is it ? " Her watch-she knew she 'd checked it earlier-was n't on her wrist . " Early still . We 're almost through , " Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more out , " Charlotte decided . But no one seemed to much care . For a while , she thought about phone calls she might make tomorrow , then she tried to concentrate on the game . Will had folded , so he looked up , raised his eyebrows , then reached behind the bucket to drum his index finger lightly on the back of Charlotte 's hand . She looked down . He was pointing , very slightly , to her left . At once , Charlotte saw what he was trying to show her . The ornate , ivory handle of a handgun was peeking out of Edward 's suit-jacket pocket . Charlotte started . Helen , if she were here , would whisper , " He loves it . Thinks it 's a second dick . You should see how he 's decorated the first one . " Responding to Charlotte 's movement , Edward looked up and smirked . " Ever been to Montana ? " he asked . <p> " Once , yes , " she said . " Once I was in Bozeman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . Charlotte found herself doing this a lot lately , appropriating Helen 's life . Only last month , she 'd cut her finger while slicing a carrot . At the emergency ward , squeezing her hand in a dish towel and answering the intake nurse 's questions , she 'd given her age , automatically , as twenty-six , then said , " I mean , thirty . " The nurse had given her a queer look . " Wishful thinking , I guess , " Charlotte grinned queasily " Well , " Edward folded his hand and turned purposefully to Charlotte , " Bozeman , that ai n't real country . Where I 'm from is real country . Up in the mountains . Bozeman ... " He turned from Charlotte and spit at the floor . That , Charlotte hoped , would say it all , but then he turned back to her and said , " You can hear mountain lions up there . Ever hear a mountain lion ? " " No , I guess I have n't . " <p> " It sounds like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just like a woman screaming , if you see what I 'm saying . " Charlotte looked at her knees . Her skin felt too sensitive . Yes , she knew what he was saying . <p> " What I mean , " he said , in case it was not entirely clear , " is it sounds like a woman screaming at the height of passion . You see ? " <p> " Ante up , " Will said in a disapproving voice . It was his deal . And then a shot fired ; Charlotte jumped at the sound , imagining she could hear it , even after the initial shock , ringing through the narrow streets outside , bouncing from building to building to the street , and never once finding the sky to escape . <p> " My God , " Charlotte said , tears springing embarrassingly to her eyes . I want to go home , she thought . Right now . She picked up her drink to hide her reaction , but her hands were trembling , so she set it immediately back down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunkenness descended on her quite suddenly , like some dirty , gauzy garment she now had to wear . " It 's only a firecracker , " Will said . " Some festival , " Greg explained . " It starts at midnight . You walk backwards into the water for good luck or to dean your soul of sins or something like that . A religion thing , " he added dismissively . <p> " I 've never heard of that , " Will said . " I saw some people , " Charlotte offered , and tried to talk very carefully , clinically , to prove to herself that she was n't drunk . " Outside my hotel room ? They were doing something in the ocean . I mean , it looked like they were baptizing people in the ocean . <p> " Probably the Tie-heads , " Greg said . The reporter . He would know . " Colorful clothes ? " <p> Charlotte nodded . Too broadly , she thought , and pulled her chin to a halt . <p> " The Spiritual Baptists . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Will . He shrugged . " How the hell would I know ? " Water made Charlotte think again of a bath . How nice it would be to get clean . She really felt terrible now and had that vague sense of her skin as being insufficient , as if she could n't count on it , not tonight , to hold her together . If she stood , who knew what organs might drop to the floor ? <p> " Okay , " Will said . " Another game of seven-card stud . " Charlotte did n't even look down at the cards Will dealt her . " I 'll be right back , " she said to no one in particular . " Nope , nothing there , " she heard Will say as she stood . She knew she had to step carefully now . How had this happened ? Greg had brought her a third drink , and she 'd sipped it , even though she had n't wanted it , because she could n't figure out what to do with her hands . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again asked the bartender to call her a cab . " Please do n't let him leave , " she smiled . She wondered if he could tell she was drunk . She felt suddenly exhausted by everything-the traveling , the conversation with Will , even her own embarrassment . <p> " Bathroom ? " she asked , and the bartender pointed to a door in the corner . <p> It was small and old , but , thankfully , clean , with those brown paper towels that smelled so horrible when they got wet . She set the water running . Her face , in the tiny mirror above the bathroom , was pale and twisted into a mask of pure irritation . Charlotte tried to settle her face into expressionlessness . Even so , she saw that there was something hopelessly stupid about the fatuous flesh that ran along her jawbone to her ears . The unnecessary softness seemed greedy . I want , I want . Even her cheeks were petitioners . You do n't have to be so sell-fish . Oh , God , she thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall and started to cry . <p> When she stopped , she looked up at her stained face and thought of something she 'd heard , years ago , when she 'd seen a production of The Dybbuk . In the play , the water stains on the synagogue 's walls were the building 's tears , its sorrow over the sad moral state of the Jews . <p> Charlotte burned herself when she went to test the sink 's water . The short , sharp pain almost set her to crying again , but she added cold water , and when it felt right , she scrubbed her face with a small bar of white soap . Okay , she thought to herself . She was settling down . Okay . This was how she always ended her crying jags , with the sense that she 'd just retreated from a fistfight and found , despite her breathlessness , that her wounds were n't so bad . <p> She stepped back to look at herself in the mirror . Her top was pasted with sweat to her breasts , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled the fabric off her chest . <p> The door to the bathroom cracked open . " Someone 's in here , " Charlotte called , but the door continued to open , and she quickly brushed the back of her hands over her cheeks , as if some tears might still be there despite her fierce scrubbing . It was Will , pushing the door open with his blue-jeaned hips , then elbowing it closed . <p> " You okay ? " he asked . " You all right ? " Her eyes had started to tear again . She turned from the mirror , and , in that watery space between them , it seemed he was swimming to her . <p> " Are you all right ? " he asked again and put his arms on her shoulders . " We 're all your friends here . Do n't worry . " " Thank you , " Charlotte sniffed and crossed her arms over her breasts . " It 's okay , " Will said . Next to her , he was just her height , smaller than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How could she have expected answers from someone who was so negligible in the flesh ? <p> " Thanks , Will , " Charlotte said cheerfully , to undercut the intimacy of the situation . She knew she should ask him to go . Will laughed . " I 've got a real name . It 's Henry . " The water was still running in the sink , and Henry reached behind her to wet his hands . He rubbed his palms over his face . " This what you doing ? Washing up ? " Charlotte nodded . He dipped his hand into the water again and said , raising his eyebrows , " I could help . " <p> " Oh . " Charlotte felt too panicked to say anything more . So he had been flirting with her , after all . " I , " she started , leaning her hip against the edge of the sink . She felt flattered . If someone as attractive as Henry would consider her , then maybe she was n't so bad . Naive , Charlotte knew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she was a female type but a male type ; the guy who thought a beautiful woman on his arm signaled his own attractiveness . <p> " This okay ? " Henry said , and she nodded her head yes . He moved toward her . " You 're really ... you know , you 're ... " He waved his hand . She saw she was supposed to fill in the blank with a compliment . So what ? Beautiful ? Special ? Vertical ? Charlotte laughed and rolled her eyes . " You , too . " " Me ? " Henry said , placing a wet hand on her neck . " Naah . I 'm a dime a dozen . " He leaned in to kiss her . <p> " Um , " Charlotte said , pulling back . " What 's your last name ? " Henry smiled , and before he answered , she let herself imagine their life together , self-deception of this sort being her prerequisite for sex . The future , as she saw it , involved an alarming amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish ? Charlotte wondered . That might be awkward , given her reason for being here . But he did n't look Jewish . <p> " Well , " she said , mock-satisfied , " now I know everything . " He leaned forward again to kiss her , placing his warm lips on her own and his tongue , quickly and deeply , into her mouth . A kiss that was n't a prelude to sex so much as an assumption of it . Charlotte felt this was the moment for a decision on her part , but all she thought was that she probably tasted like alcohol , even though her earlier dizziness was subsiding . Tomorrow , she could n't blame this on drink . <p> She felt her blouse being pulled from her skirt . And then Henry 's warm hands , his chapped fingers , moving on her waist , her stomach , and finally under her bra , damp with the day 's sweat , and onto her breasts . His thumbs were slightly scabby , as if they 'd been cut up by fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sink , then pushed her carefully back over the porcelain . " Cold , " she said and almost giggled . <p> " Condom ? " she thought to add . <p> " Oh , yeah , yeah , " he said , reaching into his back pocket , and Charlotte flashed on the day she 'd thrown out Helen 's diaphragm . She 'd been squatting on the bathroom floor of the apartment they shared , going through a cabinet and pitching Helen 's lipsticks and headscarves into the trash . When she came to the diaphragm , she felt compelled to open the case . The diaphragm itself was virginal , never used . Charlotte already knew that . She 'd spent much of the past year reassuring Helen about the man she 'd eventually meet , the one who was n't going to care about her lumpy reconstructed breast . One night she 'd even said to her old boyfriend , Lawrence , " Well , you would n't , you know , care , if it was someone you loved , " and he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would . " " Wrong answer , bucko , " Charlotte had said , then pulled her pillow out from under her head and clobbered him . She had thought of all this as she had clicked the diaphragm container shut and tossed the whole thing in the bathroom 's plastic waste bucket , registered the light thud of plastic hitting plastic , and then . . . and then nothing . That was that . <p> Once Henry had the condom on , he pushed into her with such ease that Charlotte imagined she had been doing this all her life , wandering into restrooms and having men she was n't even sure she had been flirting with follow her . <p> She felt she was going under , and she was , sort of , slipping sideways over the low sink as he rolled onto her . Her feet , crossed at Henry 's back , left her toes to tickle the string of a light cord , her hair to graze the dirty linoleum . Henry whispered , for no apparent reason , " Oh , hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You believe me . Do n't you ? " <p> She did n't answer . His skin was lovely . Perfect , smooth , save for a spot where it was peeling at his back . Why had n't his days in the lifeboat done more damage ? She envied the hardness of his thighs against her own . God , she mouthed , blood rushing to her head . Lawrence had never been this . . . this what ? " Yes ? " Henry said , as if she 'd spoken aloud . <p> " Just , just , " she stopped . " Do it " - dumb pornography , the truth was she relied on it- " as hard as you can . " He smiled , like he 'd figured her out , and said , " Oh , so it 's like that , is it ? " But he did what she wanted , saying-and she winced at the words- " Here you go . " And then the liquor she 'd been drinking took another lap through her circulatory system . She felt woozy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , only she was completely aware of that abandonment . The bathroom cartwheeled around her , and then she thought , as if she were a third party in the room , an outside observer , Hey ! I 'm doing it with a spectral being . <p> Henry reached around her side to turn off the faucet , to stop the water from streaming below her . " No , " she closed her hand around his . " Leave it . " Everything was so unlikely that she assumed , in a distracted way , that this was it ; she was finally having the nervous breakdown she craved . The release of a collapse . Did n't all grievers want that ? <p> Water swooshed under her . " Okay , " Henry whispered , while Charlotte imagined the drain stopping up , the sink filling , and then water running over the lip of the sink , building up on the floor , crawling up Henry 's legs , over his hips , then reaching her back and rising farther . She could n't help it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flood . <p>
