<p> HUTTO - Yo , Fido , listen up ! <p> Just exactly what is it you want ? A bone ? A cat to chase ? A romp with the pack ? <p> Well , puppy , you 're aiming way too low . <p> With a bit of training , a touch of discipline , you could be the hottest thing on the canine sports circuit . A valued team player in a fly-ball doggie relay . Or how about chasing an exciting career in retrieving or , maybe , law enforcement ? <p> All you need to know is available under one roof 30 minutes from Austin . <p> The Triple Crown Dog Academy , which opened last month outside this community , is designed to be a one-stop training center for dogs of all breeds and aspirations . And it 's meant to tap a growing desire among dog owners for more meaningful interaction with their pets . <p> Spread over 350 rolling acres on the edge of the Texas Hill Country , the $ 3.5 million academy offers ponds for swimming , fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with golf course turf , heavenly coat-massaging showers and a 32,000-square-foot sports arena equipped with special high-traction , shock-absorbing flooring . <p> As workers recently labored to complete the facilities , owner Jerry Wolfe eagerly anticipated arrival of his first four-legged guests . <p> " This is going to be an Olympic park for dogs , " Wolfe said . " We 'll have everything from all-breed shows to field trials and agility trials - almost every dog sport that exists . " <p> " There is nothing like it in America , " Knox Williams of the Austin Kennel Club said of the facility . " There 's nothing even close . " <p> The all-season arena , Wolfe hopes , will lure dog shows and performance events from around the nation . Each year , roughly 13,000 such events are staged by clubs affiliated with the New York-based American Kennel Club . The number of purebred dogs registered by the organization has grown by more than a quarter of a million since 1970 . <p> Training at the academy ranges from basic , six-session group obedience classes designed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their owners attend - to months-long specialized instruction for performance events . The academy also is equipped to train hunting , tracking and police dogs . Key to all the instruction is positive reinforcement and a willingness of trainers to , well , think like a dog . <p> Ernie Planck , professional marketing director for Ralston Purina Co. , the dog food giant , praised Wolfe for opening up the sometimes esoteric - if not elitist - world of dog training to the general public . <p> " More and more people are getting involved with companion animals - their dogs , " Planck said . " They 're more than just the family pets . They 're like children or kids - people want to do things with them . Jerry can show people there 's more to do with pets than just feed them , groom them and let them sit on the couch . " <p> <p> ' Dog nut ' <p> Wolfe , 38 , who described himself as a " dog nut and lover forever , " first wrangled with the intricacies of dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog , Shawn , a Samoyed , a medium-sized , white-haired breed , was charming but obstinate . <p> " We just wanted him to be a good citizen , " Wolfe said . " My parents insisted that he be trained or else . He was chewing up the back yard . Yeah , tearing up the house . <p> " I took him to a group obedience class , but he was n't the most willing participant . He was a very difficult dog to train , and I really did n't know anything about dog behavior or the mechanics of dog training . " <p> For Shawn , becoming a poster pooch for obedience training just was n't in the cards . <p> Despite his early disappointment , Wolfe 's love of animals grew . In later years , he dabbled in dog training , occasionally attending a seminar as he earned a living in Arizona , first as a seller of sporting goods , then as a leaser of automobiles . <p> After selling his auto business in the late 1980s , Wolfe searched in vain for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . <p> Then Wolfe 's wife , Tiffany , suggested that his next business be " something that I had a passion for , something that I really loved to do . " <p> Wolfe enrolled in St. Louis ' Tom Rose School , America 's " Harvard " for would-be dog trainers . <p> <p> ' It was grueling ' <p> " It was grueling , " he said . " Seven-day weeks , 12-hour days . They did n't make us memorize the breeds , but we had lectures and then we had to train three or four untrained dogs in different specialties . . . . I think the school has a 30 percent dropout rate . " <p> Wolfe then returned to Tucson where he opened a small training school for dogs . In 1996 , Wolfe and his wife , who had attended college at San Antonio 's Trinity University , came to Texas to build their dream academy . <p> " We needed a location that was large , but that was near an urban area that could provide restaurants , hotels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in a run-down cattle ranch just outside Hutto . <p> As construction progressed , Wolfe assembled a crack team of trainers and support personnel , including some from the Rose School . <p> <p> Going through paces <p> One recent afternoon , resident dogs - those belonging to the staff - went through their paces at the academy . Sonny , a 4-year-old German shepherd , gracefully arced over A-frame obstacles in pursuit of a hurled barbell ; Griz , a black Labrador retriever , plunged headlong into ponds to retrieve batons ; Ace , 3 , a golden retriever , precisely pranced at the side of trainer Keith Benson , ever alert for the next cue . <p> With hard work , many dogs can achieve this level of skill , Wolfe said . <p> But Wolfe believes many dog owners will - as he did so many years ago with his dog Shawn - seek basic training to convert wayward hounds into model citizens . <p> Key to obedience training , counter conditioning or any of the more specialized regimens is , first , positive reinforcement of good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dog is behaving the way it is . <p> " We do n't put the dog on the couch , " Wolfe said . " We put the owner on the couch . " <p> " If Fido is barking in the back yard , we need to find out why he 's doing it . Is he bored ? Is he territorial ? Does he have a neurotic backyard barking behavior ? " <p> Barking , furniture-chewing , garden-digging - all can be evidence of boredom , the dog school owner noted . <p> " If he 's barking out of boredom , he 's simply lonely , not mentally stimulated , " Wolfe said . " Many people think that by taking their dog jogging that he 's happy and fulfilled . You 've fulfilled his exercise needs but not his mental requirements . Most dogs are designed for some kind of work . Just because they do n't have sheep does n't mean the herding instinct goes away . <p> " Give him something to chew . Dogs like to dig . Give him his own space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect him to just sit there and wait for you . " <p> While they have memories , dogs are very much creatures of the here and now . <p> " They are very situational , " Wolfe said . <p> Consequently , in training them , it is important that commands be closely linked with actions . The lesson is lost on the dog unless the command to " sit " instantly is followed by pushing the animal 's rump into position . <p> <p> Aware of gestures <p> Dogs are keenly aware of gestures . Some dog owners misinterpret that phenomenon to mean that the animals understand the consequences of their actions . <p> " People will anthropomorphize their pets - assign human capacities to them , " Wolfe said . " They 'll say , ' Fido knows he 's done wrong when he gets into the garbage . I 'll come in and he knows he 's in trouble . ' " <p> What 's really happening , Wolfe said , is that the dog is reading and reacting to its owner 's negative body language . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen that before , ' " Wolfe said . <p> Occasionally , he added , trainers will encounter a problem owner . <p> " No one wants to hear the dog is not the problem , " he said . " A lot of times , though , it 's true . It 's not because the owner is bad or does n't care . It 's more our lack of understanding that this is a canine , a different species . It does not understand English or human gestures . <p> " Let me drop you off in the middle of Paris and let me see how you do . That 's a dog . That 's what his perception is like . You do n't bark . You do n't use the gestures that his mother used or his siblings used . We have to teach you how to communicate with another species in a way it understands . In doing that the bond increases . The understanding level increases . When that is accomplished , harmony occurs . <p> " That is a beautiful thing to see . @
