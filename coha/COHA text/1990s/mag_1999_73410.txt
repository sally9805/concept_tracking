The son of a two-star Army general , Dan Lyle wants it known that he loves his country , he really does . It 's just that , by choosing obscurity in England over glitz in the States  --  the Bath Rugby Club over the Minnesota Vikings  --  Lyle surely violated some law dating back to the Revolutionary War . " All my friends were saying , Go to Minnesota , you idiot ! " says Lyle , who weighed simultaneous offers from the two teams in 1996 . " But some of the best experiences of my life had been in rugby , and one reason I left football in the first place was that the turnover is so high and the guarantees are so low . I finally decided if you enjoy what you 're doing , why spoil a good thing ? " // Lyle told the NFL to take a hike , and three years later , on the eve of next month 's Rugby World Cup , he 's the first American to be considered among the best players on the planet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year it named Lyle , 28 , to its World 15 international all-star team . " For a big guy he has absolutely staggering athleticism , and his dexterity with the ball is amazing , " says Stephen Jones , the Times 's rugby correspondent since 1983 . " He 's probably one of the most extraordinary players I 've ever seen . " // How could this happen ? How in just five years could a part-time Bennigan 's waiter and aspiring NFL tight end take up rugby , sign with the world 's most storied club and redefine the number 8 flanker position ? What 's more , if Lyle could do it , how good would the U.S. be if other talented football players  --  Barry Sanders , we know you 're listening  --  followed Lyle to the field where sissydom is defined by helmets and pads ? // In England , where the 6 ' 4 " , 245-pound Lyle is both a marvel and a Marvel Comics character ( CAPTAIN AMERICA ! screamed one tabloid ) , his secret is simple . He combines the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and soccer  --  with a blessed disregard for English stuffiness . Take kick-offs . While most rugby teams allow their opponents to catch kickoffs , Lyle barrels downfield and leaps for his own team 's hanging boot as though he were Jerry Rice . " Dan is universally regarded as the greatest regatherer of kicks in the U.K. , " says Jones . Take pitches . Three or four times a match he will toss a behind-the-back or over-the-head pass a la Larry Bird , astounding the Brits . " To me it 's a natural thing , but they 're so traditional , " Lyle says . " They had never really been exposed to Americans playing their sport , and they did n't know how to react . " // Add to that flair a soccer sweeper 's defensive vision , a running back 's ability to break tackles and a basketball forward 's 36 ? - inch vertical leap ( the better to catch line-outs , rugby 's inbounds play ) , and it 's easy to understand why U.S. coach and general manager Jack Clark says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // Freakish is probably the best way to describe Lyle 's rise through the rugby ranks . It began in spring 1993 , when he was living outside Washington , working as a waiter and hoping for a call from an NFL team . Lyle had gone undrafted despite his success at Virginia Military Institute , where he was the third-leading receiver in school history . On a lark one weekend his cousin Mark Casey invited Lyle to play a match with the Washington Rugby Club in Kenilworth Park . " It was the greatest thrill of my life , " Lyle says . " Here was a combination of every sport I 'd ever played , a sport that was all about attacking . In college I had been a receiver on a wishbone offense , so I caught only 30 balls a year . Now I could go get the ball . " // It was n't long before Clark , who lives in Berkeley , Calif. , heard the buzz about the football player who was terrorizing the D.C. rugby scene on weekends . At a club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time . " Word had gotten out that I was looking for athletes who did n't necessarily have much rugby experience , " Clark says . " Dan looked very much the business . His hands were twice the size of a normal man 's , and his body was clearly NFL material . " // Without even seeing Lyle play , Clark invited him to the next U.S. training camp in Riverside , Calif. , where Lyle 's first attempt at catching a kickoff made his coach 's jaw drop , cartoonlike , to the turf . " On kickoffs you need to have great timing , sprinter 's speed and flypaper hands , " says Clark . " Well , the first time Dan ran down a kickoff he was better at it than anyone else in the world . He did n't know anything else about what to do out there , but it did n't matter . We could teach him all that . " // After a couple of failed tryouts with the Washington Redskins , Lyle began traveling with the national team , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and in October 1994  --  just 14 months after taking up the sport  --  earned man-of-the-match honors in his first game for the U.S. , against Ireland . He won them again in his second appearance as the Americans beat Canada on the road for the first time , 15-14 . In May 1996 , he approached a scout from Bath who had come to look at one of his U.S. teammates . " I went up to him and said , ' I 'll be the biggest , strongest , fastest flanker you 've ever had , ' " Lyle says . " You know , the whole Jack Nicholson thing . You want me on that wall . You need me on that wall " // Rugby had just gone professional in England , and Bath , the six-time national champion , took a look at the cocky American and made him an offer : one year , $52,000 , no guarantees . At the same time the Vikings had another deal on the table : one year , $116,000 base , no guarantees . As Lyle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had to choose , and he picked Bath . // At Bath , Lyle 's learning curve was " exponential , almost inverted , " he says . He was man of the match in his first-team debut , a nationally televised showdown against rival Harlequins , and soon took over as the starting number 8 , a position right behind the scrum that demands the skills of both a fullback and a middle linebacker . At the end of the 1996-97 season he was named the English Premiership 's newcomer of the year and one of five finalists for player of the year . That was nothing , though , compared with the following season , when Lyle led Bath to a 19-18 victory over the French club Brive in the European championship before 50,000 fans in Bordeaux , France . // Lyle 's astonishing rugby feats have spawned wild-eyed conjecture among the sport 's American fans : What if more football players took up rugby ? " They all say overseas that whenever we take this game seriously , we 'll beat everyone , and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get some All-Pros and train them in rugby , we 'd go out and kick ass . Hell , I 'll take all those guys who were second-team All-SEC but did n't make the NFL , guys who do n't want to work for $25,000 a year at Kmart when they could be full-time athletes making $100,000 , playing a sport that 's pretty damn fun . " // That said , he wo n't have them for the five-week-long Rugby World Cup , the world 's third-most-watched sporting event ( behind soccer 's World Cup and the Olympics ) . Besides Lyle , the only U.S. player who was a football standout is French-born flanker Richard Tardits , who became the alltime sack leader at Georgia and had a four-year NFL career with the Arizona Cardinals and the New England Patriots . Despite a recent 106-8 loss to England , the Americans are optimistic . Ranked 17th in the world , they have upset Canada , Fiji and Tonga this year , a remarkable feat for a World Cup team that does n't field an entire lineup of professional players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two landscapers , a substitute teacher , a miner and a chiropractor. ) // The Yanks have gone 1-5 in their two World Cup appearances , in 1987 and ' 91 , and if they are to fulfill their goal of reaching the second round this year , they 'll almost certainly have to win twice : against Ireland in their Oct. 2 opener  --  in Dublin  --  and against Romania . ( The Eagles ' other opponent in the first-round round-robin is Australia , a tournament favorite . ) " We 're playing against guys who 've played the game since they were five and have every resource , " says Lyle . " We do n't have that , but we do have a great will . " // They also have a transcendent player , one who 's making from $200,000 to $250,000 a year and has no regrets about dissing the NFL . " No one 's going to offer me a million dollars to play American football , and I 'd never give up the experiences I 've had in rugby , " says Lyle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his future , and he points out that rugby may reappear in the 2004 Olympics after an 80-year hiatus . " Did you know we 're the reigning Olympic champions ? " he says . " Paris , 1924 . I 'll bet nobody in America knows that . " // Nobody in America knows Dan Lyle , either . The way he 's taking over his new sport , that may be about to change .
