This week the two greatest golfers in the world , David Duval , 27 , and Tiger Woods , 23 , will play in the Masters , the greatest of golf tournaments . It offers the tantalizing possibility of a head-to-head shoot-out between two of the game 's rocket launchers , and the kind of Jack Nicklaus vs . Arnold Palmer face-off that can make golf absolutely riveting television . Alas , there are eight dozen more golfers in the field . Let 's hope they do n't get in the way . <P> You know Tiger , of course . When he won his green jacket in ' 97  --  crushing the course and the competition with a 12-stroke margin of victory  --  he set off a golf boomlet . But this year Woods comes careering through the gates with dented fenders and wheels coming off . Tiger 's been losing his temper and his putting stroke . He shed his agent , and he bagged his caddy , the cuddly Fluff Cowan . He does have one Tour win this season and a number of high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> That may not be well enough to handle Duval , a quiet man given the nickname " Rock " who rolls into Augusta , Ga. , having recently won a minor major , The Players Championship , against a tougher field than he 'll face at Augusta . That victory punctuated an altogether astonishing 18-month run of golf . Late in the season of Tigermania , Duval won his first-ever PGA tournament . He won the next week too , and then the next . " We knew that once David got going , he 'd win a bunch , " Davis Love III said last week . " But we never expected a roll like this . You wonder where it 's going to end . " Or if . The roll has included 10 victories in 33 starts , and record winnings last year of $2.6 million . <P> Duval 's win at TPC last week had an overarching specialness in that it came on the same afternoon as his golf-pro dad 's first win on the Senior Tour . His relationship with his father Bob has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to late 1980 , when David 's elder brother Brent was found to have a rare blood disorder , aplastic anemia . David donated bone marrow , but Brent died soon after of graft-vs. - host disease . Nine-year-old David wondered if he had contributed to his brother 's death and became a subdued , serious child . <P> Bob Duval was the pro at Timuquana Country Club in Jacksonville , Fla. , and the golf course became David 's refuge . It would not shield him then , nor could it later , when his parents divorced , finally , in 1996 . But things have since improved . Duval has reconciled with his father , while his mother has fought her way back from depression . Duval 's longtime girlfriend , Julie McArthur , has said it ca n't be coincidental that David 's breakthrough in golf arrived as he and his family achieved a certain stasis.
