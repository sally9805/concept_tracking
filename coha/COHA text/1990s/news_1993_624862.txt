<p> FORT RILEY , Kan.  --  In a high-stakes gamble that many thought was doomed to fail , the United States abandoned the military draft 20 years ago this month and sought to recruit an all-volunteer professional military . <p> Here at the home of the Army 's First Infantry Division  --  " " The Big Red One "  --  it is evident that the idea succeeded beyond the wildest hopes of the Pentagon brass . Smart and ambitious young men and women poured into recruiting stations and have lifted the military 's enthusiasm and professionalism to unprecedented heights , say veteran sergeants . <p> Yet behind the military 's dazzling performance in Desert Storm and its confident handling of the more recent , difficult assignment in Somalia , lies a troubling consequence : <p> Today 's military is out of synch  --  some critics say seriously so  --  with the society it is sworn to protect . <p> Fewer serve . Those who do serve longer than draftees did , and they live more separated from civilian society . They are recruited not on the basis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research , much like corporate recruiting of the 1950s . <p> In wartime , this divide between America and its military would likely provoke bitter domestic strife over the issue of who should be selected to die for his or her country , and who should be exempt . <p> But even in today 's relative peace , the civilian-military gap is evident in issues such as gays in the military . Many in the military feel civilians have no right to foist their own social values on the military unless they , too , serve . Civilians , most of whom have never seen the inside of a military base , ca n't understand why the military opposes a blanket lifting of the gay ban . <p> " " I do n't want to sound all patriotic , but I do think it 's a good idea to serve your country and that everybody ought to serve somehow , " says John T. Brown , a 24-year-old sergeant and tank gunner here in the 4th battalion , 37th Regiment . <p> But Brown was the only one in his high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military ; he has left his buddies and their civilian society far behind . <p> Both Brown and his tank 's driver , Pfc . Larry Covington Jr. , intend to make a career of the Army , unlike the draftees who served two years before returning to civilian life . Like many of his fellow troops , Covington , the son of an Army sergeant , dismisses civilians completely . <p> " " This is the only life I know , " he says , indicating Fort Riley 's sweeping , olive-drab bustle . <p> Ending the draft did n't end the inequity of military service , says Staff Sgt. Aaron Jagger , master tank gunner . High schoolers are lured into the military with the promise of good pay and up to $ 30,000 in college tuition . <p> " " The result is the upper echelons ( of society ) are alienated from us , as are the poor and illiterate , " says Jagger . " " The low and middle classes is who 's here . . . and this becomes our life . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been subtly transformed during the past two decades . <p> The all-volunteer military opened vast new opportunities for blacks , for example . Twice the proportion now serve as did in the draft Army . In peacetime , that is an incalculable benefit to society , as black soldiers who may lack other opportunities leverage their military training , discipline and self-confidence into productive civilian careers . <p> In wartime , however , the heavy proportion of blacks in combat jobs exposes them to disproportionate risk of being maimed or killed in combat . Almost a third of the Army 's enlisted ranks is black , compared to 11 percent of comparably aged civilians . <p> ( The Pentagon faced precisely that problem in the early years of the Vietnam war , when black casualties soared . With anger rising in racially tense neighborhoods back home , the Pentagon rotated blacks out of frontline units . Battlefield deaths dropped , and averaged about 11 percent over 13 years of the war . ) <p> At the same time , the military 's high recruiting standards have disenfranchised thousands of struggling youths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a better life . During the 1970s , 130,000 black youths dropped out of high school and went into the military . Today , virtually no dropouts are accepted . <p> More broadly , the shift from conscription to voluntary enlistment destroyed the idea of military service as a widely shared obligation of citizenship . <p> In World War II , one man in 10 was drafted to serve ; the Vietnam-era draft , even with its haphazard inequities , brought one in 20 eligible males into the military . <p> Today , roughly one in 42 Americans between ages 17 and 35 serves in the military . And as the military gets smaller , military service will become even more distant to most Americans . <p> The result , many feel , is a dangerously widening chasm between American society and its military forces . <p> Inside the military itself there is an undercurrent of anger , a sense of bearing an unequal burden on behalf of an unappreciative nation . <p> " " I do n't think the American people understand us , " Marine Sgt.Maj . Freddie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of a community . No more , " said the 41-year-old Tellis , who oversees a helicopter squadron currently deployed in the Middle East . <p> Ending the draft " " was a terribly destructive thing ; it has hurt the country enormously , " said Joe Membrino , a Georgetown University classmate of President Clinton who was commissioned an Army officer in 1968 . <p> " " A lot of people who are privileged and powerful do n't have to think about military service any more , " said Membrino , now a Washington lawyer . <p> " " With the all-volunteer military , you do n't see your sons and daughters potentially at risk ; your only connection to the military is whether defense spending brings jobs to your neighborhood , " he said . <p> It is against this background that senior military officers , even as they prepare to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the all-volunteer force , are beginning to see disquieting signs of trouble ahead . <p> In sum , these problems seem to reflect a growing public apathy about the armed forces . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Storm scared off many by reminding them that they might actually have to fight  --  a point rarely raised these days by military recruiters . <p> But along with the draft , the military 20 years ago abandoned the ideal of military service as a noble duty . The Pentagon 's manpower managers learned instead to speak in terms of product , market share and cost-effectiveness . <p> The only tool the Pentagon has left now is to ratchet up targeted advertising and hope for the best . Next year , the Army hopes to spend $ 30 million on advertising , up $ 6.8 million from this year . <p> It may not be enough . <p> Potential recruits are already scared off by the military 's highly publicized downsizing : Why enlist when the Army is firing some soldiers and paying others to retire early ? Worse , Congress has ordered a freeze on military pay and has capped future cost-of-living increases . Possibly as a result , this is the first time in memory that enlistments have sagged even as civilian unemployment remains high . <p> And there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for recruits with Clinton 's proposed national service program , which would also reward volunteers with college tuition money . <p> " " I 'm scared to death about where it 's going to go in the future , " says Carney , now the Army 's manpower chief . " " Frankly , I 'm not sure there 's a lot of positive things out there . " <p> He makes a point of telling a visitor : " " Make sure you tell them out there that we 're still hiring ! "
