<p> Just over a year ago , Dave Heineman was pedaling a bicycle cab around Downtown Denver . Between that gig , a second job of building taxi-tricycles and another as a radio disc jockey , the Denver resident was pulling down a non-whopping $ 22,000 a year , or thereabouts . <p> And , boy , were his legs tired . <p> Heineman , 29 , is now using his brain instead of his quadriceps to earn $ 35,000 a year . He works for stock brokerage house D.E . Frey as a systems administrator , which is technology speak for making sure his company 's internal computer network is up and running . <p> ' I wanted to go into a direction with my knowledge rather than my strength , ' said Heineman . ' It 's amazing what I 've learned , what I 'm applying at my job , and what I 'm still learning at my job . ' <p> Heineman made the transition from cabbie to techie last year by taking out $ 9,000 in loans to attend a six-week course at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Colorado that specialize in producing information technology workers . <p> These schools , seeing an opportunity in Colorado 's shortage of high-tech workers , have flocked here from as far away as Halifax , Nova Scotia . They have grown dramatically in number , courses offered and students enrolled . <p> According to the state 's Division of Private Occupational Schools , which approves a host of for-profit training programs to do business in the state , the number of schools offering computer-related courses has grown from 24 in 1993 to 40 this year . <p> It 's not hard to see why . Colorado has more than 12,000 unfilled skilled positions in information technology and telecommunications - a 10 percent job vacancy , according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics . The number of high-tech jobs is expected to double from today 's 122,500 in the next 10 years , the bureau projects . <p> As a result , schools are working with companies such as US West to upgrade the skills of existing employees . With so many job openings , many trainees are willing to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that range from several weeks to nine months . <p> ' Not only has the number of schools grown , but the schools that have been in business have been adding programs that are technology-based , ' said Shirley Tipton , director of the Division of Private Occupational Schools , which is part of the state Department of Higher Education . <p> ' These folks are businesspeople . They are in the business of providing education for a profit . There 's got to be a market for them . We consistently hear from the students and the schools that they have no problems at all getting jobs when they are done , and they are sometimes hired before they finish the program . ' <p> Lakewood-based AmeriTeach started primarily as a Microsoft software training vendor with about 200 students in 1994 . The school now enrolls about 2,000 students per year , said Lisa Wargo , an account executive with AmeriTeach . <p> The school , which is in the process of applying for a state license , has career tracks for programmers and is adding a Web development and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 to 12 weeks and cost $ 8,000 to $ 13,000 . The job market is so hot that AmeriTeach guarantees jobs to graduates of its Microsoft program , Wargo said . <p> ' The market is amazing , ' she said . ' For language programmers , they earn probably from $ 50,000 up . In the Microsoft networking track , they earn probably high $ 30,000s . ' <p> ExecuTrain of Colorado , a franchisee of ExecuTrain Corp. , which is based in Atlanta , just opened its fifth location in the state , in the Denver Tech Center . The Denver-based franchise chain represents 11 percent of ExecuTrain 's worldwide revenue from 230 locations , said Remington Green , general manager of the local franchise . <p> Neither Green nor ExecuTrain Corp. , which is privately held , would release revenue figures , but he said he expects his franchise to triple its size in the next few months through acquisitions . <p> ' A lot of what it says is , there 's a great market in Colorado , ' said Green . ' We have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To me that 's all opportunity . That means they understand the value of education . ' <p> ExecuTrain 's courses range from single classes that cost about $ 100 to $ 400 to nine-month programs that cost up to $ 12,000 . Students can condense the courses into shorter time periods . As with many proprietary schools , students often take out bank loans , arranged through the school , to pay tuition . <p> They graduate qualified for jobs as entry-level network administrators , database administrators and help-desk operators , typically earning $ 25,000 to $ 40,000 a year , Green said . The school does not place them in jobs but has a job-assistance program that includes a job bulletin board , resume and interviewing workshops , and contacts with recruiters , Green said . <p> ' Probably 40 to 50 people graduate per month , and I maybe get one to two calls a month from people that say they are struggling , ' Green said . ' My phone would ring off the hook more if they were n't getting jobs . ' <p> About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanting to upgrade the skills of employees . The remainder are individuals , many of whom are in service or administrative jobs and want something better , Green said . <p> Among the companies is US West , which has about 500 information technology jobs open in Colorado and about 800 in the telephone company 's 14-state region , said Dave Laube , the company 's vice president and chief information officer . It has a constant need for software engineers , systems analysts and database designers , he said . <p> To fill that need , US West has invested in upgrading the skills of current employees , using both proprietary schools and a new program offered by the University of Colorado at Denver 's College of Business and Administration . <p> US West spends just over $ 4,000 per employee annually on training , a figure that includes salaries and benefits of workers while they are in class . About 80 percent of the training funds are spent with private training institutions such as ExecuTrain , Laube said . <p> Considering that US West 's information technology organization is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22 million a year . <p> ' You need to remember , it 's almost always cheaper to acquire a curriculum or a class than for us to develop it in-house , ' Laube said . <p> Information Technology Institute , based in Halifax , Nova Scotia , saw the need and selected Downtown Denver for its first U.S. location . <p> ' It 's an ideal location , not to mention the hotbed that it is for high-tech , the telecommunications piece , e-commerce and e-business companies , ' said Richard Franklin , the school 's president and chief operating officer . <p> As a company , Information Technology Institute generated $ 5 million in revenue in 1996 , the year it went public , said Gary Kluwak , the company 's executive vice president . It projects revenue of $ 100 million in 2001 but does n't expect to be profitable again at least until then , due to its expansion costs , Kluwak said . <p> The 12,000-square-foot Denver school represents a $ 3 million investment , and the company is already talking about an expansion , Franklin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students per year companywide . Its first Denver class had 39 students . It hopes to increase that to 10,000 annually in the next three years , Franklin said . <p> Incoming students must have a bachelor 's degree . The cost is $ 24,000 . <p> Companies come on campus to recruit , using interview rooms . The classrooms and offices resemble the plush digs of a Fortune 500 company , and students walk the halls cradling the IBM ThinkPads they get to keep as part of their tuition . <p> In the first three months after graduation , 93 percent of graduates are employed - working as consultants , software experts and project managers , Franklin said . The number goes up to 96 percent after the next six months , he said . <p> Elaine Tunkel , 30 , was one of Information Technology Institute 's first Denver students . <p> A former software and financial data saleswoman , Tunkel moved to Colorado in 1997 . After some travels and some temp work , she found out about the school through a newspaper ad . So far , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> ' What I can earn in the market - as long as it stays good , knock on wood - is more than I 'm paying on this loan , ' said Tunkel . ' We are just about guaranteed that we will work after this program . I feel so confident about it , that it 's a matter of where and when . ' @p#
