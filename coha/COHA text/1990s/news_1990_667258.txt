<p> In the homestretch of the holiday season , you 're trying to knock off those pesky details . Find the Scotch tape . Brave mall crowds . As if you did n't have enough to do . <p> Take comfort that at least one group is busier than you are . In the final weekend of this holiday season , people at every level of the retail industry are kicking into high gear . And this year , they 'll have a tougher job than ever . Warm weather , a cold economy and worries of war in the Persian Gulf have produced the stingiest shoppers in years . In the final days , retailers are praying for a crush of customers who will whip out their plastic and start buying . This is n't just the busiest weekend of the season , it 's the most important . <p> Here 's how some of the players will make it happen : <p> - The toy seller . Peter Morehouse , manager of Toy Central in Ramsey , N.J. , says the hardest part of the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is when parents swarm into his store , infused with the annual Christmas panic . Says Morehouse , " Stiff neck syndrome is when they are craning their necks at something way high up by the ceiling . They get upset that they ca n't reach it , and there 's probably one right in front of their knees . " His plan this weekend : Be friendly , helpful and in four places at once . <p> " I 'll be out on the floor selling , running up and down the stairs to make change for the registers , making sure my employees are where they are needed and watching to see what 's selling out . " This year toys such as Nintendo Game Boy ; Go Go , The Walking Dog ; and Baby Alive are moving fast . In case of a sellout , Morehouse adds a fifth location to his list : on the phone with his boss in White Plains , N.Y. , begging him to track down more of the hot item . <p> Half the year 's profits come during the two-month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest volume . This year 's toy buyer is " very dollar conscious " says Morehouse . Toy Central focused money and energy promoting the store 's " everyday low prices " to compete with the sales run by big competitors Child World and Toys R Us . But he is used to coming down to the wire on sales . " I 'm relieved when I see the customer go through the door with a cart full of purchases . Then I turn right around and go sell a bike . That 's my day . " <p> - The midnight operator . The phones at L.L. Bean in Freeport , Maine , will ring all night , up to and including Christmas Eve . Barbara Maier , a three- year veteran of the 11 p.m. - to- 7 a.m. shift , says her crew of 15 will do the phone work better handled by 30 in the wee hours of the last weekend . <p> " We get a lot of calls around 2 a.m. , and then again at about 5 : 30 a.m . Some are whispering - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some just woke up in the middle of the night and had to call Bean , " she says . <p> Catalogers are not exempt from this year 's retail crunch . But this year did bring special midnight callers : Members of the military stationed in Saudi Arabia . Because of the time difference , those calls mostly come in on Maier 's shift . <p> - The personal shopper . Trusting someone else with your holiday package can be stressful . Nobody knows that better than Sandy Maizel , the lone personal shopper at Abraham &; Straus in Brooklyn , N.Y . If you think you 've got a ton of people to shop for this weekend , Maizel has 40 lists that size . It 's her job to take the orders over the phone and then scour her store for the perfect gift . Sometimes she has a specific request , other times she 'll only be given an age and size . But the pressure 's on her to get it right - especially now that there 's no time for error . " People do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call back in five minutes , " she says . <p> People are spending an average of $ 70 per gift list , Maizel reports . That 's down from $ 150 earlier this year . A &S; had no personal shopper last season . <p> Maizel does it all for you . The browsing , the choosing , elbowing up to the register , wrapping , sending . All you do is send her the money , her service is free . To move things along this busy time of year , she shops for several clients at a time , carrying the items in a red grocery-store cart . That has provoked some misunderstandings with A &S; security guards , who have suspected Maizel was an especially brazen shoplifter . <p> - The overnight shipper . Because your gift absolutely , positively has to be there about 72 hours from now , the team at Federal Express is on red alert . Vice president of service systems Roger Podwoski - the package mover - keeps a weather eye on the sky . Last year 's final holiday push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - icy roads , frozen vehicles . It was a nightmare , Podwoski says . <p> This year , temperatures could reach 60 in some East Coast cities , but Podwoski is taking no chances . FedEx sites nationwide are prepared with extra anti-freeze , standby trucks and drivers . Podwoski receives worldwide weather updates hourly from his 12-person meteorology staff - no watching the Weather Channel when holiday presents are on the line . Daily volume of packages rises about 17% this time of year , and today , Saturday and Sunday are the days when a year 's worth of planning must come off smoothly or thousands of holidays will be ruined . " We 're like a football team . We 've practiced our two-minute drill a lot . Now , in the end of the half , we have to execute , " Podwoski says . <p> - The toy company president . In these last days , top execs come down from the glass towers to work the floor . Peter Harris , president of F.A.O . Schwarz , will don the store 's traditional rocking-horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store this weekend , along with the company payroll manager , the head buyers , all the top brass . Starting today , little can be accomplished in the board room and office , he says . <p> Those who buy toys from Harris wo n't know they 've been helped by the president of the company - his badge wo n't include his title . But you might be able to pick him out in the crowd of salespeople . Harris will be the one who routinely sneaks off to the telephone in the preschool section , next to the Big Bird . He 's calling the distribution sites to make sure the 3,000 catalog orders are winging their way to new homes . <p> " I wo n't see the inside of my office from Friday , till after Christmas , " says Harris . <p> F.A.O . Schwarz is not feeling the pinch other toy sellers report , so the pressure at the stores might be less intense than at many retailers . Harris credits the store 's longstanding reputation as a high-class retailer of high- end toys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last weekend before Christmas selling toys . He loves to walk up to customers and try to guess the age of the child they 're buying for . ( He admits to a spotty success record . ) " This is the best part of my business . I love it . " <p> - Santa . Whoever you are , you 're not as heavily in demand as the men in red suits , granting audiences to thousands of children this weekend . Ken Hobbs , who plays Santa Claus in two San Francisco-area malls , says there 's nothing like the lines of children the last weekend before Christmas . <p> Saturday , Hobbs will work two four-hour stints at the County East Mall in Antioch , Calif . Sunday , he 'll sit from 8 : 30 a.m. to 1 : 30 p.m. , asking children what they 'd like , hearing endless requests for Nintendo and smiling while they tug at his real white beard . In between , he 'll entertain at private corporate parties , participate in a local radio station promotion and appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 an hour through his employer , Western Temporary Services . <p> Hobbs says he loves the frenzy of the last few days . He 's been a Santa for several years and the crush of last-minute visitors is no surprise . The hardest part is a new technological wrinkle in his job - the video tape . When Hobbs began his Santa career , children had their pictures taken with him . Today , they take away a three-minute video of My Visit With Santa . That means coughing up three minutes of conversation with each child - not always an easy task . Babies are especially hard , Hobbs says . <p> And what about last Wednesday , when someone brought a dog , cat and macaw to sit on Santa 's lap ? " That dog tried to eat my face . Things get crazy this time of year . " CUTLINE : WISHES : Ken Hobbs , as Santa , will spend a busy weekend with kids such as Joslynn Aquino .
