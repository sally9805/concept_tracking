Even by his standards , it was an extraordinary week for the man in the spare , spacious office on the third floor of the Council of Ministers building inside the Kremlin . Any one of the setbacks that befell him between Monday and Friday would have been a severe test of his ingenuity and stamina . His attempt to revive a stagnant economy seemed only to be provoking fresh resistance from populace and parliament alike . Just as the war of nerves between the Kremlin and secessionists in Lithuania entered a new and delicate phase , Mikhail Gorbachev suddenly faced a challenge to his power much closer to home . His only real rival in the turbulent arena of Soviet politics , the maverick former Politburo member Boris Yeltsin , mounted an impressive campaign to become the president of the country 's largest and most important republic , the Russian federation . <P> Nor was all quiet on the international front . With Gorbachev preparing to leave for this week 's summit meeting in Washington , his host George Bush indicated that because too many Americans see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be difficult to lift trade restrictions against the Soviet Union . Meanwhile , Gorbachev 's Foreign Minister , Eduard Shevardnadze , met with his West German counterpart , Hans-Dietrich Genscher , in Geneva . It was an upbeat meeting except on what may be the single most neuralgic point for Soviet foreign policy : Genscher reiterated that a unified Germany will be a member of NATO . <P> Despite all these new problems and reminders of old ones , Gorbachev was still trying to convey the impression that he was driving events rather than reacting to them . In one of his boldest political gambles yet , he linked the implementation of economic reform  --  higher prices , lower state subsidies and the introduction of some free-market mechanisms  --  to a nationwide referendum . So much , he seemed to be saying , for the twin charges that he is unwilling to submit to genuine democracy and afraid of tough decisions . The immediate response of his fellow citizens was not encouraging . In Moscow and other cities , panicky shoppers stripped stores of what little remained on the shelves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last summer said they would protest the impending price rises and call for a nationwide strike next month . While Gorbachev 's critics were puzzling over that ploy , he made a tantalizing new offer to the Lithuanians : their own state in two to three years if they " freeze " their unilateral declaration of independence . Then , when he met with French President Francois Mitterrand for a tour of the horizon , Gorbachev reiterated his insistence that ending the cold war means retiring NATO . <P> In the midst of these multiple challenges , Gorbachev met for an hour last Tuesday with five journalists from TIME for his only interview before leaving for the summit . All around the world , and all around the Soviet Union , people may be wondering how long Gorbachev will last , and how he has survived with so many things going so wrong . Those questions , however , were far from his thinking . He was the man at the eye of the storm , supremely confident that he will still be working his will and wit on the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
