It took Apple Computer chairman Gilbert Amelio 2 1/2 hours to say it , but Apple devotees last week finally got what they 'd been waiting for : assurances that despite rumors to the contrary , the next generation of Macintosh computers will run most of the old software . The bad news is that it will be at least a year before the new system , code-named Rhapsody , is ready for public release . <P> " Backward compatibility , " as they call it in the industry , had been an open question since last month , when Apple , after repeated setbacks in trying to keep its aging Mac OS ahead of rival Microsoft , announced that it would buy Apple co-founder Steven Jobs ' NeXT Software company for $400 million and use his widely praised operating system instead . Apple officials now say the new system will not only work with most current Mac hardware and software but will probably look and feel like a Mac as well . <P> Will NeXT save Apple ? A few days earlier , the company warned investors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $150 million ; its stock plummeted 18% . Amelio blamed the loss on disappointing sales of Apple 's Performa computers but insisted that his comeback plan was " still solid . " Said he : " We 're making a dramatic shift that 's going to change everything . " <P> That remains to be seen . One good sign is that despite his windy speech at the annual Macworld Expo in San Francisco  --  which featured four movie stars , three CEOs , rock singer Peter Gabriel and former heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali  --  most software developers came away optimistic . The big question now is whether Apple 's hitherto loyal consumers will keep the faith . <P>  --  By David S. Jackson/San Francisco
