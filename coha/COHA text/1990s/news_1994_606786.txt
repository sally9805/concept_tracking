<p> AFTER FOUR VISITS TO LONDON , I 'm getting used to the Not There Anymore syndrome . When you 're a Dickens enthusiast , you want to see all his landmarks , such as the hateful blacking factory where the young Dickens ( and the fictional David Copperfield ) toiled , or the Marshalsea , the debtors ' prison whose spiked walls confined the author 's father ( and the fictional father in " Little Dorrit " ) . Alas , those buildings are Not There Anymore . <p> Even so , every part of London , from Southwark to Soho to Hampstead Heath , has associations with Charles Dickens . His books salute the city he called a " magic lantern . " He named his characters with its street names , kenneled his villains in its unsavory dens and sentimentalized his young lovers in its squares . <p> And while the poorhouses and prisons so vividly portrayed by Dickens have vanished , time has spared some of the Victorian London he immortalized in words . The Dickens House on Doughty Street , where the writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novels , is now a museum packed with original manuscripts and personal relics . Walking tours offer glimpses of legal London and other Dickensian milieus . And on Hampstead Heath , you can still feel the freedom that drew the author to its wooded paths high above the smoky city . <p> From the outside , the Dickens House on Doughty Street  --  where the writer lived with his young wife , Catherine , from April 1837 to December 1839  --  is unremarkable . It 's in a row of houses on the order of Bloomsbury ; only its blue plaque hints at the literary richness inside . <p> In the study , my fingers moved reverently over the tall wooden desk that Dickens used as a teenage law clerk . Generations of clerks had scored its surface with their initials and other graffiti . I did n't find anything Dickens had carved , although the young Charles had sat at this desk , on a high stool like the one depicted in Phiz 's illustrations for " Nicholas Nickleby " ( which was written in this house ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endless artifacts evoking 19th-century London . The museum 's collection of " Plagiarisms and Piracies " showed how popular Dickens was in his lifetime ( the irate author complained frequently about the lack of copyright laws ) . A long glass-fronted cabinet held letters and part of the manuscript of " Pickwick Papers , " completed in 1837 . I longed to stroke the energetic handwriting of this first novel , which Dickens was working on when he and his young wife moved into this house . The first of his nine children was a baby then ; the next two children were born here , and the increasing brood and his increasing success led the Dickens family to seek larger accommodations . They moved to Regent 's Park , but that house is Not There Anymore . <p> At the turn of the staircase is a trade sign , the Goldbeater 's Arm , mentioned in " A Tale of Two Cities . " Gilded and powerful , it had hammered the air at No. 2 Manette St. , Soho , which probably suggested Dr. Manette 's name when Dickens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cobbler 's bench . <p> In Dickens 's bedroom , I lingered at another case of letters , mostly sharp-toned comments to his publisher about his work as an editor for the Daily News , and displays of theatrical memorabilia . The effervescent Dickens loved the theater  --  he often performed in plays and gave animated readings of his work . One memento was an ivory pass to Her Majesty 's Theater given in 1846 , inscribed " Charles Dickens Esq . " on the back . <p> In the basement , a research library is lined with Dickens 's works , from novels in collections of original monthly parts to leather-bound and gold-tooled editions to modern paperbacks with extensive notes . I could have sat there and read for hours . <p> We stayed in Dickens 's house till the staff reluctantly closed it . Then , feeling the dust of 150 years in our throats , we headed for Lamb 's Conduit Street and the Lamb , one of Dickens 's " locals . " Our American accents , as usual , made heads turn as we found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have gained a little privacy by swiveling " snob screens " of frosted glass . Instead , we sat at a round wooden table whose brass rail corraled our pints . I leaned back and thought about Dickens sitting here , telling stories like Mr. Pickwick . <p> In a country noted for its walkers , Dickens stands , or rather strides , alone . A nocturnal wanderer , he knew every street of London . A walking tour is therefore singularly appropriate . <p> We joined a tour offered by a firm called City Walks and set out to trace a few of Dickens 's footsteps . Our guide , Alec Bell , met us at the Holburn tube station . " We shall be walking in a somewhat calmer city than the one of Dickens 's imagination , " he began dryly . We smiled . London haunted Dickens and fed his creative energy ; his writings in turn enhanced that great metropolis . <p> We headed south to the spacious sweep of Lincoln 's Inn Fields , London 's oldest and largest square . Across the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forster , Dickens 's friend and biographer . Dickens " borrowed " the residence for use by sinister Mr. Tulkinghorn in " Bleak House . " <p> On nearby Portsmouth Street , the red-roofed " Old Curiosity Shop " seems a sad , small remnant , dwarfed by the 12-story edifices that surrounded it . Beneath its Dickensian sign , the shop 's window is emblazoned " Antique and Modern Art , " but it was empty , and another sign said " To Let . " Built in 1567 , the shop is old , all right , but it 's not the shop of Dickens 's book . <p> " No one 's sure where the real one was , " said our guide , though Dickens described it as being between Leicester Square and the National Gallery . It 's Not There Anymore . <p> I have to admit that loss of landmarks is n't always a bad thing . On my first trip down the Thames , more than 20 years ago , the riverboat 's commentator drew our attention to the abandoned warehouses on the Southwark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This dreary setting was where Bill Sykes 's frenzied escape had ended in his swinging between buildings choking on his rope , fit payment for his crimes in " Oliver Twist . " On my most recent trip down the Thames , those warehouses , you guessed it , were n't there anymore . <p> The Thames is also cleaner now than on my first trip , and it 's fortunately quite transformed from the days when " Our Mutual Friend 's " Gaffer Hexam pulled his awful livelihood from the river : dead bodies . <p> While the river scene is still enriched by association with Dickens , entrepreneurs are also enriching themselves . From Dombey and Son , gents ' outfitters , to the Dickens Inn at St. Katharine 's Dock , commercial London remembers him , in a laundered sort of way . I once ate lunch at the Little Nell pub ( a name indigestibly sweet ) , with a charming view out to a yacht harbor . A far cry from the " discoloured copper , rotten wood ... and green dank deposit " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to Carey Street , about three blocks away . At the back of the ornate white Royal Courts of Justice , we learned about the Bankruptcy Court and the problems of the author 's debtor father . He spent , as our guide put it gently , " perhaps too much money with the wine merchants . " <p> Then we ducked through a narrow doorway into the Middle Temple , one of the Inns of Court that still provides chambers for lawyers . This was formerly the site of a 12th-century monastery of crusading knights known as Templars . When they fell from grace , other monks took it over . Later , the monks provided food and lodging for lawyers , and the interlinking buildings , courtyards and halls became known as the Inns of Court . <p> Dickens 's early life imbued him with a distaste for legal machinery , a recurring theme in his novels . ( He describes lawyers in their chambers as " maggots in nuts . " ) We filed down a narrow lane with jutting brick-edged oriel windows , the hangout of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed out . The lane opened into Brick Court , which surrounded us with brick and stone buildings . Hundreds of small-paned windows stared accusingly , putting us and our intrusion on trial . We moved through an archway into New Court , dated 1667 , and down wide stone steps into Fountain Court , the scene of a romantic meeting in " Martin Chuzzlewit . " It was an oasis of tall cool trees , where a blackbird sang by the fountain 's round pool . <p> As we walked along the Temple buildings , I looked through the windows of the modern legal offices and saw rows of documents tied with narrow red ribbons  --  the origin of the term " red tape . " <p> Moving back to Fleet Street and up an alley to Gough Square , we stood in front of Samuel Johnson 's narrow , dark-brick house . The square had also housed the Monthly Magazine , the perceptive publication that accepted Dickens 's first freelance piece in 1833 . When it appeared , he wrote , his eyes were " dimmed by joy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or others that followed later , our guide said . <p> Through a short maze of crooked streets , we walked on to Chancery Lane , an elongated S-shape whose dark buildings created an intimidating tunnel effect  --  suitable for the High Court of Chancery ( " most pestilent of hoary sinners , " as Dickens wrote in " Bleak House " ) . Here , bordering Lincoln 's Inn , there are shops for lawyers selling white wigs with sausage roll curls , black gowns with white neck-bands , formal black worsted suits and decorous ties . <p> A sign on an empty aged building in Lincoln 's Inn adjured sternly , " No windows are to be broken out without leave . " You 'd think in a country that law-abiding , one would n't need all these lawyers ! But there they were , crossing the short green grass in their wigs and flapping gowns . <p> Back on Holborn , our guide pointed out the 16th-century Staple Inn . A masterpiece of half-timbering , it 's one of the Inns of Chancery , adjuncts to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived before moving to the Doughty Street house , is Not There Anymore . <p> At Gray 's Inn , a cheerful wedding party in bright gowns and solemn suits was leaving the Hall . Dickens started his career here in May 1827 , as a 15-year-old law clerk in an office at 1 South Square . I stood in the office doorway , looking out at the scene Dickens would have seen every day . After the writer became famous , our guide told us , he gave many public readings in the Hall . It was a neat knitting of the ends of Dickens 's life . <p> Friends of ours lived in Hampstead , once a country village but now part of greater London . Dickens once stayed here , in the North End , and often visited to partake of local sociability . <p> We found birds nesting in the " tollhouse " roof at Spaniards Inn , where the road still narrows , forcing modern traffic to slow as it did 200 years ago , though the Bishop of London no longer collects a toll . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white and impressive as when its garden hosted a tea party in " The Pickwick Papers . " Jack Straw 's Castle , a nearby establishment , has been greatly enlarged since Dickens 's day ( only the middle part being somewhat the same ) . Outside , an arts and crafts show livened the garden ; upstairs , the " highest restaurant in town " proclaimed Hampstead 's height above the city . <p> The hills of Hampstead with their winding streets surround Hampstead Heath , a huge park engulfed by the city . One evening we all climbed a long curved path to find a panoramic view of London . Signs showed the silhouettes of buildings we could see miles away . St. Paul 's dome was a dot on the far horizon . People were picnicking on the grass , eyed by a rook whose meandering walk kept him near their food-spread blanket . <p> Nearby , formation kite fliers were making their stringed beauties curve as sweetly as swifts , as precisely as the Blue Angels . While a steady wind blew over the heath , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I thought of David Copperfield , and Mr. Dick with his homemade kite soaring in the evening air . <p> To borrow a line from " Great Expectations , " Dickens is in every London prospect  --  on the river , in the people , in the light , in the darkness , in the street , in the wind . Every time I 'm in London , that indefatigable walker and chronicler will be with me , showing me the city of his imagination . <p> Cecily S. Nabors is a freelance writer who lives in Silver Spring .
