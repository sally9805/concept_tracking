During meeting of church leaders with Yasir Arafat in Gaza last month , Judith Craig , a United Methodist bishop from Ohio , offered a prayer . After the prayer Arafat grasped Craig 's hands and said , " Pray for me every day . " The president of the Palestine National Authority needs all the divine and human help he can get . So do the more than 800,000 Palestinians who live under his jurisdiction in the little enclaves of Gaza and Jericho , as well as the 1.2 million who live in the still-occupied West Bank . The Oslo peace accords gave Arafat and the Palestine National Authority partial control over a small piece of the territory Israel has occupied since 1967 . The agreement led to Nobel Peace Prizes for Arafat and for Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres . But now that the early excitement over the accords has worn off , it has become painfully obvious that the deal was far more favorable to Israel than to Arafat . The Israeli military still controls passage in and out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the area . Palestinians are still held for hours for questioning at Gaza 's borders . Violent attacks in Israel and at Israeli checkpoints in Gaza by Islamic militants have led to border closures , preventing all but a few Gaza workers from commuting into Israel . The discrepancy between the promise of the accords and the reality has angered Arafat 's opponents and left him feeling frustrated and trapped in Gaza , an area packed with refugees and mired in poverty . The Israelis were more than eager to relinquish it  --  retaining , of course , their well-guarded settlements along the coast . Financial support promised by the U.S. and other nations , initially projected at $2 billion , has been agonizingly slow to arrive , creating further disappointment and a sense of betrayal . The money essential to run Arafat 's government , keep the peace , and build economic structures is being withheld , the donors claim , because Arafat has yet to demonstrate that he can be accountable for how it is spent . Issues of accountability and record-keeping may indeed be behind the holdup of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arafat to fail , even at the price of a bloody civil war . This view does not seem to be shared by Peres , who played a courageous role in persuading his government to sign the Oslo accords and who continues to agitate for Israeli financial help for Arafat . But opponents of the accords within Israel prefer either Israel 's retention of the territories or the adoption of the " Jordanian option , " under which King Hussein would assume control over a Palestinian entity linked to Jordan in a confederation . When Arafat arrived in the Gaza Strip , he was greeted with nationalist fervor and great expectations . Thousands of celebrants waving once-illegal Palestinian flags believed that their struggle against Israel had finally led to economic and personal freedom . Instead of a fast track toward freedom , however , the Palestinians have gained only limited control over medical care , tourism , education and social welfare . Israel determines he parameters of Palestinian rule . Rachel 's Tomb , for example , on the road between Jerusalem and Bethlehem , remains under Israeli control . Medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The cost of converting computer software into Arabic is $600,000 , an amount the Palestinians do not have and which the Israelis have refused to pay . The Palestinians were ill-prepared to assume responsibility for an area described by one American economist as " deliberately de-developed by the Israelis  --  its population pauperized , its sanitation , health , educational , residential and commercial services reduced to almost nothing . " In an article in the Progressive , Edward Said deplores the deal Arafat made with Israel and quotes an observation by Israeli writer Danny Rubenstein , who points out that British rulers in Palestine ( 1918-1948 ) " built the port of Haifa and several airports , six power stations that supplied all of Palestine with electricity and dozens of roads and public buildings that are still in use in Israel today . " In comparison , during Israel 's 27-year military control of the occupied territories , the only new structures built were prisons . Adds Rubinstein : " The Israelis have the gall to deplore the fact that no infrastructure allowing an orderly transfer of authority exists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Israeli authorities doing all they could to cripple Palestinian society , how could it be otherwise ? " Despite outbursts of violence and a widespread sense of despair , some signs of progress can be seen in Gaza . Police in neat uniforms direct traffic at dusty intersections , waving trucks , vans and horse-drawn wagons into some semblance of order in a city that has had no stoplights and no traffic police for decades . A few hotels and restaurants have opened along the seafront to accommodate diplomats , the occasional tourist and potential business investors . ( On the day we stopped for lunch at a newly refurbished restaurant , we spotted a delegation of Israeli peace activists traveling with Anwar Sadat 's daughter , who had arrived in Jerusalem earlier in the week on what she termed a " peace mission . " ) We had not expected to see Arafat , but apparently he was eager to convey a message to Americans : Tell President Clinton we need help quickly , or it will be too late . Too late , in this instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaza , Jericho and the occupied territory of the West Bank , a senseless , violent confrontation between Arafat 's 10,000-member police force and the radical religious groups of Hamas and Islamic Jihad . Disappointment over both the symbol and reality of continued Palestinian humiliation is palpable . Hamas and Islamic Jihad , whose hard-core Muslim followers constitute less than 20 percent of the population , have been able to stir up opposition against Arafat because , as Arafat told his visitors , " we have made all of the sacrifices and have received none of the benefits " of the Oslo agreement . Israeli leaders , except for Peres , seem to prefer the " Jordanian option . " Rabin appeared to indicate , is preference when , during the signing of the Israel-Jordan accords , he acknowledged King Hussein as the " historic " leader responsible for " religious " supervision of the Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem . This deliberate snubbing of Arafat 's potential leadership of East Jerusalem is part of Israel 's unrelenting campaign to convince the world that East Jerusalem  --  including the walled Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judaism and must remain forever under Israeli control . When I asked Arafat why he did n't pick up the telephone and tell President Clinton about the desperate nature of his situation , he swung around in his chair and responded , eyes flashing , " He would not take my call . " I was not sure whether he meant this literally , and suggested that Clinton was the sort of man who would want to help if he understood fully the suffering of the people in Gaza . To underscore his financial plight , Arafat launched into a bitter tirade against Kuwait for what he termed the " withholding " of the 5 percent tax which , prior to the gulf war , had been collected from Palestinian workers . A sum of $138 million raised from this tax should be handed over to the new Palestinian Authority , Arafat said . " You should tell your Dennis Scott a U.S. envoy engaged in the Middle East peace process to get that money for us . " While it is true that Kuwait had been collecting a tax on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kuwait abandoned its support of the PLO when Arafat sided with Iraq in the gulf war . It is not eager to come to Arafat 's aid . Arafat is correct , of course , in asserting that the U.S. could exercise its considerable clout with Kuwait and the other gulf states if it wished to do so . In visiting the areas of Palestinian authority our group stopped briefly at Palestinian army headquarters in Jericho . We found a staff finishing work on the first edition of an Arabic-language newspaper . The journalists among us savored the moment almost as much as did the Palestinian editors . There is something about putting out your o newspaper , especially when it is newly free of military censorship , that suggests that something exciting is being born . It was a moment I wish could have been shared by all the diplomas and potential donors who seem unable to grasp the danger of a dream being not only deferred but denied . <p>                    @
