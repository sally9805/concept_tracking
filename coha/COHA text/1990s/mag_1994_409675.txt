TO HER NEIGHBORS IN THE SCENIC Scottish fishing village of Portmahomack , Anne Perry , 55 , was the very model of middle-aged propriety  --  dignified , devout , devoted to her 82-year-old mother , her pets and her rose garden . To mystery buffs , she was the author of two Victorian detective series admired as much for their moral resonance as for their rich period detail . Then suddenly this summer came a development as startling as any in Perry 's 19 novels : in July , New Zealand 's Sunday News revealed that 40 years ago there , as teenager Juliet Hulme , she had been convicted of helping murder a friend 's mother . " I thought , " This will ruin me . It will kill my mother , lose me my friends and ruin my career , ' ' " says Perry , whose identity was discovered by journalist Lin Ferguson while working on a story inspired by a new film about the sensational 1954 case , Heavenly Creatures . " I never thought it would come out , but it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do go around thinking , " What would people think if they really knew ? ' ' " Forty years ago , all of New Zealand did know  --  or thought it knew  --  the story of the frail , London-born immigrant and her 16-year-old best friend , Pauline Parker . Perry , daughter of a physicist turned college administrator and his schoolteacher wife , had suffered since childhood from what she calls a chest complaint , and when she was 8 , a doctor told her mother he did n't think the girl would survive another English winter . So Perry was shipped off to live with a foster family for 15 months , first in the Bahamas , then in New Zealand , where her parents joined her . When tuberculosis confined her to a sanatorium for three months in 1953 , she forged a close friendship with her schoolmate , Parker , through a daily exchange of letters . With her parents out of the country during her sanatorium stay , " Pauline was my only contact with the outside world , " Perry recalls . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she stood by me as a lifeline . " Her friend was also " desperately unhappy , " according to Perry , and suffered from an illness much like bulimia . After Perry 's release , she was considered too weak to return to school . Her isolation at home was deepened by the disorienting effects of a respiratory medication , which Perry says was later taken off the market because it was " judgment-distorting . " Then in the spring of 1954 Perry 's world collapsed . Her father lost his job as president of Christchurch University and announced he would be returning to England via South Africa , while Perry 's mother , Marion , left the country with a family friend soon to be her second husband . Perry was expected to leave with her father and 10-year-old brother  --  but without Pauline , unless her friend 's parents allowed her to go . Pauline 's mother forbade it . Her distraught daughter suggested murder  --  and Perry agreed to participate because , she says , she believed her friend " would take her own life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , at that time ... I know it 's stupid , but it seemed to be one life or the other . She had stood by me when I was ill , and to my mind it seemed like no one else had . ... Was I going to walk out and leave her ? " From this point on , Perry says she can recall almost nothing of either the murder or the lurid trial that followed . The prosecution alleged that on June 22 , 1954 , Honora Parker was bludgeoned 45 times with a half-brick given to Pauline by Perry . In her statement to police , Perry admitted striking at least one blow herself . Her only recollection now , Perry says , is outrage at her lawyer for not allowing her to rebut what she felt were the prosecution 's distortions , including depictions of her and Pauline as " dirty minded little girls " engaged in a relationship with lesbian overtones . " All I remember is the horror of people talking about me and not being able to say , " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says . The prosecution 's case relied heavily on a diary kept by Pauline , in which she detailed the girls ' plans for the deadly assault . Pretending to be resigned to their upcoming separation , they would accompany Pauline 's mother on a farewell outing to a Christchurch park . Perry was to plant a bright object ahead on their path ; when Mrs. Parker stooped to pick it up , Pauline would strike her on the head . " I feel very keyed up as though I were planning a surprise party , " Pauline wrote . " The happy event is to take place tomorrow afternoon . So next time I write in this diary , Mother will be dead . How odd , yet how pleasing . ... " Convicted of murder following a six-day trial , both girls were sentenced to indefinite terms and sent to separate facilities . ( Perry says she never saw or communicated with Pauline after the trial and has no idea what became of her . ) Perry spent most of her 5-1/2-year sentence at Mount Eden , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First came three months of solitary confinement during which , Perry says , the fog from her medication began to clear . " I got on my knees and said , " I am at fault , and I am sorry , ' ' " she says . " The best way to fulfill being sorry is to make jolly sure that from then on you do the best you can in every respect . " By 1960 , both Perry and Pauline had been released and given new identities by New Zealand authorities because of the notoriety of the case . But Perry chose to take the name of her stepfather , Bill Perry , when she returned to England and moved in with him and her mother in the industrial city of Newcastle-on-Tyne . Though her memories are hazy of just what role her parents played during her arrest and trial , Perry says , " I want to make it plain that my family stood by me absolutely . " For the next 17 years , she supported herself mainly by secretarial work . " I was socially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which included five years in California before she returned to England . As for memories of her crime , " I had periods of feeling rotten , but they got further and further apart . Nature does heal . " So , too , she found , did the doctrines of the Mormon church , to which she was introduced by her neighbors in the San Francisco area in the late ' ' 60s . " I suppose I was drawn by the inherent kindness and fairness of it , " says the never-married Perry , whose social life since has centered around the church . " It is not a religion that says you 're going to get something for nothing . You can not do something wrong and walk away from it , but what you do is repent . " Perry , who says she had always wanted to write , published her first Victorian mystery , The Cater Street Hangman , in 1979 , and has since sold 3 million books in the U.S. alone . She claims she only tried her hand at crime fiction because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her late 20s . She disavows any resemblance between herself and the amnesiac detective hero of one series , William Monk . " He 's got a whole past he does n't remember , " says Perry of Monk , who is featured in her new mystery , The Sins of the Wolf , out next month ( Fawcett/Columbine ) . " My missing period was only a few weeks . " Yet she admits she invented the Monk character because " I wanted to explore looking for the monster outside and finding it in yourself . " When Perry 's past caught up with her she initially feared losing the tranquillity she had found five years ago in Portmahomack , where she shares a dramatic converted barn with three dogs and two cats . ( Her mother lives nearby . ) Instead , says the village postmistress , Peggy D'Inverno , " everyone has rallied round , even people I thought would enjoy the scandal .

" We were greatly surprised , " says Linda Grey , president and publisher of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment where we did n't feel that this was a very courageous woman , who had led an exemplary life ... who we feel it 's important to continue to support . " Though she hardly welcomed the exposure , Perry can see now , she says , that " in some way perhaps it is the last step as far as healing is concerned . Because I 'm finding that now practically everybody in the world knows who I really am  --  and they still like me . " <p>
