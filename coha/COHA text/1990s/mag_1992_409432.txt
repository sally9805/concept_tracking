In the realm of outdoor literature , few have captured the Southern tradition as sweetly as Archibald Rutledge . South Carolina 's first poet laureate , Rutledge was an avid hunter and wrote often of the virtues found in a life lived close to nature . In Why I Taught My Boys To Be Hunters , Rutledge explores the unique bond that is forged when the hunting tradition is passed from father to son . It 's a call for the preservation of the hunting heritage written in words that ring as true today as they did upon their first printing 55 years ago . I have said that my hunting has often been solitary ; but that was chiefly in the early days . During the last twenty-five years I have rarely taken to the woods and fields in the shooting season without having one or more of my own sons with me . Few human relationships are closer than those established by a mutual contact with nature ; and it has always seemed to me that if more fathers were woodsmen , and would teach their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems would vanish . Providence gave me three sons , only about a year and a half apart ; and since it was not possible for me to give them what we usually call the advantages of wealth , I made up my mind to do my best by them . I decided primarily to make them sportsmen , for I have a conviction that to be a sportsman is a mighty long step in the direction of being a man . I thought also that if a man brings up his sons to be hunters , they will never grow away from him . Rather the passing years will only bring them closer , with a thousand happy memories of the woods and fields . Again , a hunter never sits around home forlornly , not knowing what in the world to do with his leisure . His interest in nature will be such that he can delight in every season , and he has resources within himself that will make life always seem worthwhile . Hunters should be started early . As each one of my boys reached the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I began to let him go afield with me . For a year or so I never let him load the gun , even with dust shot ; but I just tried to give him some notions of how to handle it , of how to cross a ditch or a fence with it , and in what direction to keep the muzzle pointed . It was a great day for each youngster when he shot his first English sparrow with a .22 shotshell . From the time when the first one was six years old , I could never get into my hunting clothes without hearing , " Dad , take me along ! " Sometimes an argument was added : " I will shoot straight . I will put it on him ! " To these winning pleas I have always tried to give an affirmative answer , even when I had to alternate carrying a played-out boy and a played-out puppy . But I knew that I was on the right track when I was trying to impress on the younger generation the importance of shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old copy-book maxim , " Teach the young idea how to shoot . " I think the rod and gun better for boys than the saxophone and the fudge sundae . In the first place , there is something inherently manly and home-bred and truly American in that expression , " shooting straight . " The hunter learns that reward comes from hard work ; he learns from dealing with nature that a man must have a deep respect for the great natural laws . He learns also , I think , in a far higher degree than any form of standardized amateur athletics can give him , to play the game fairly . Most of our harmless and genuine joys in this life are those which find their source in primitive instincts . A man who follows his natural inclinations , with due deference to common sense and moderation , is usually on the right track . Now the sport of hunting is one of the most honorable of the primeval instincts of man . What human thrill is there in lounging into a grimy butcher-shop and sorrowfully surrendering a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certainly any true man would far rather trudge fifteen miles in inclement weather just for a chance at a grouse . Even if he gets nothing , he will be a younger and better man when he gets home , and with memories that will lighten the burden of the days when he can not go afield . A lot of good people , seeing me rearing my sons to be woodsmen , have offered me advice . " How can you love nature and yet shoot a deer ? " " How can you bear to teach those children to kill things ? " These parlor naturalists and lollipop sentimentalists , whose knowledge of nature is such that they would probably take a flying buttress for a lovely game bird , are incapable of understanding that it is far less cruel to kill a wild deer than it is to poleax a defenseless ox in a stall . The ox has no chance ; but the deer has about four chances out of five against even the good hunter . Besides , I have a philosophy which teaches me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunted , because of their peculiar food value and because their character lends zest to the pursuit of them . It has never seemed to me to be too far-fetched to suppose that Providence placed game here for a special purpose . Hunting is not incompatible with the deepest and most genuine love of nature . Audubon was something of a hunter ; so was the famous Bachman ; so were both John Muir and John Burroughs . It has always seemed to me that any man is a better man for being a hunter . This sport confers a certain is refreshing ; moreover , it allies us to the pioneer past . In a deep sense , this great land of ours was won for us by hunters . Again , there is a comradeship among hunters that has always seemed to me one of the finest human relationships . When fellow sportsmen meet in the woods or fields or the lonely marshes , they meet as friends who understand each other . There is a fine democracy about all this that is a mighty wholesome thing for young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else in life I treasure my comradeships with old , grizzled woodsmen . Hunting alone could have made us friends . And I want my boys to go through life making these humble contacts and learning from fellow human beings , many of them very unpretentious and simple-hearted , some of the ancient lore of nature that is one of the very finest heritages of our race . Nature always solves her own problems ; and we can go far toward solving our own if we will listen to her teachings and consort with those who love her . In the case of my own boys , from the .22 rifle they graduated to the .410 shotgun ; then to a 20-gauge ; then a 16 ; then a 12 . I was guide for my oldest son , Arch , when he shot his first stag . We stalked him at sundown on Bull 's Island , in the great sea-marsh of that magnificent preserve , creeping through the bulrushes and the myrtle bushes until we got in a position for a shot . And that night at the clubhouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my young hunter still wide awake , no doubt going over our whole campaign of that memorable afternoon . I was near my second son , Middleton , when he shot his first five stags . I saw all of them fall  --  and these deeds were done before he was eighteen . I followed the blood-trail of the first buck my youngest son , Irvine , shot . He had let drive one barrel of his 16-gauge at this great stag in a dense pine thicket . The buck made a right-about face and headed for the river , a mile away . He was running with a doe , and she went on across the water . The buck must have known that he could not make it , for he turned up the plantation avenue , actually jumped the gate , splashing it with blood , and fell dead under a giant live-oak only eighty yards from the house ! It 's one thing to kill a deer , and it 's another to kill one and then have him accommodate you by running out of the wilds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance saves a lot of toting . This stag was an old swamp buck with massive antlers . Last Christmas my eldest son had only three days ' vacation ; but he got two bucks . Yes , I have brought up my three boys to be hunters ; and I know full well that when the wild creatures need no longer have any apprehensions about me , my grandchildren will be hard on their trail , pursuing with keen enjoyment and wholesome passion the sport of kings . While other boys are whirling in the latest jazz or telling dubious stories on street corners , I 'd like to think that mine are deep in the lonely woods , far in the silent hills , listening to another kind of music , learning a different kind of lore . This privilege of hunting is about as fine a heritage as we have , and it needs to be passed on unsullied from father to son . There is still hope for the race when some members of it are not wholly dependent upon effete and urbane artificialities for their recreation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a night club . The whole thing would seem to him rather pathetic and comical  --  somehow not in the same world with solitary fragrant woods , rushing rivers and the elegant high-born creatures of nature with which he is familiar . Hunting gives a man a sense of balance , a sanity , a comprehension of the true values of life that make vicious and crazily stimulated joy a repellent thing . I well remember the morning when I took all three of my boys on a hunt for the first time . I had told them the night before that we were going for grouse and had to make an early start for Path Valley . There must have been a romantic appeal in the phrase " early start , " for I could hardly get them to sleep that night . And such a time we had getting all the guns and shells and hunting clothes ready , and a lunch packed , and the alarm clock set ! And now , nine years after that memorable day , we still delight in making early starts together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fringes of the mountain a half hour , as we were walking abreast about fifty yards apart , we had the good fortune to flush a covey of five ruffed grouse . It was the first time that any of my boys had had a shot at this grand bird , which to my way of thinking outpoints every other game bird in the whole world , bar none . An old cock with a heavy ruff fell to Middleton 's gun . A young cock tried to get back over Irvine 's head . It was a gallant gesture , but the little huntsman 's aim was true , and down came the prince of the woodland . Arch and I were a little out of range for a shot on the rise , but ere long we flushed other birds , and I had the satisfaction of seeing him roll his first Bonasa umbellus . We were walking through some second growth , which was fairly thick . I had just been telling him that in such cover a grouse is mighty likely to go up pretty fast and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiniest fraction of a split second , it will seem to pause as it checks its rise and the direction of its flight , which is to take it like a scared projectile above the forest . I had been telling Arch that the best chance under such circumstances was usually offered just as the grouse got above the sprouts and seemed to hesitate . I had just taken up my position in line when out of a tangle of fallen grapevines that had been draping a clump of sumac bushes a regal grouse roared up in front of Arch . I could see the splendid bird streaking it for the sky and safety . At first I was afraid that Arch would shoot too soon , then that he would shoot too late ; either one would be like not shooting at all . But just as the cock topped the trees and tilted himself downward the gun spoke , and the tilt continued , only steeper and without control . With a heavy thud the noble bird dropped within my sight on the tinted leaves of the autumnal forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that was a great day for me . When a father can see his boy follow and fairly kill our most wary and splendid game bird , I think the Old Man has a right to feel that his son 's education is one to be proud of . I 'd far rather have a son of mine able to climb a mountain and outwit the wary creatures of the wilderness than to be able to dance the Brazilian busybody . When Arch was thirteen , I had him up at daybreak with me one morning in the wilds of the Tuscarora mountains . From the crest of the wooded ridge on which we were standing we could see over an immense gorge on either side and beyond them , far away over the rolling ridges , northward and southward . It was dawn of the first day , and there were many hunters in the mountains . The best chance at a turkey in that country at such a time is to take just such a stand and wait for one to fly over or perhaps to come walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We had been standing together for about fifteen minutes and had heard some shooting to the northward of us , three ridges away , when I saw a great black shape coming toward us over the tree-tops . " Here he comes , son ! " I told my youthful huntsman . " Hold for his head when he gets almost over you . " Three minutes later my boy was down on the slope of the gorge , retrieving a 19-pound gobbler , as proud as a lad could be , and entitled to be proud . It was all he could do to toil up the hill with his prize . Irvine shot his first turkey on our plantation in Carolina . He was on a deer-stand when this old tom came running to him through the huckleberries . The great bird stood almost as tall as he did . Middleton killed his first under peculiar circumstances . We walked into a flock together , at daybreak , and they scattered in all directions , but were too drowsy to fly far . He wounded a splendid bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred yards from us . There was not enough cover to enable him to creep up to it , and the morning was so very still that I was afraid his first step would scare the gobbler from his lofty perch . " I know what to do , " he whispered to me as I stood at a loss to know what to advise . " Do n't you hear that old woodpecker hammering on that dead pine ? Every time he begins to rap I 'm going to take an easy , soft step forward . Perhaps I can get close enough . " " Go ahead , " I told him , and stood watching this interesting stalk . The woodpecker proved very accommodating , and every other minute hammered loudly on the sounding tree . Step by cautious step Middleton got nearer . At last he raised his gun , and at its report the gobbler reeled earthward . I thought the little piece of woodcraft very neatly executed . If the sentimentalist were right , hunting would develop in men a cruelty of character . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discipline and iron nerve , and develops a serenity of spirit that makes for a long life and long love of life . And it is my fixed conviction that if a parent can give his children a passionate and wholesome devotion to the outdoors , the fact that he can not leave each of them a fortune does not really matter so much . They will always enjoy life in its nobler aspects without money and without price . They will worship the Creator in his mighty works . And because they know and love the natural world , they will always feel at home in the wide , sweet habitations of the Ancient Mother . <p>
