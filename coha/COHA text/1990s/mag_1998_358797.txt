The tremors from India 's nuclear explosions had barely subsided before the finger-pointing in Washington began . Where was the CIA ? Do n't our spooks know anything ? <P> Good questions , but a distraction from the main point : Why are the President and his State Department reduced to head-shaking stupefaction because a rising country of a billion people wants entry into the nuclear club ? If India 's blast is evidence of an American failure  --  a dubious proposition  --  it is a failure not of intelligence but of imagination . <P> For five years this Administration has been monomaniacally focused on producing , strengthening and expanding treaty after treaty to cure the ills of the world . A signature for every plague  --  chemical weapons , biological weapons , antiballistic missiles , nuclear tests . <P> The cure for the latter , the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty , came in for particularly lavish attention and praise from President Clinton . " The longest-sought , hardest-fought prize in arms-control history , " he called it . <P> John Holum , Under Secretary of State for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two months ago , he urged the Senate to ratify the CTBT , calling it a " historic opportunity ... to finally ban nuclear-weapons testing of any size by anyone anywhere forever . " <P> Tell that to India . Holum 's view of what parchment can achieve  --  anyone anywhere forever ?  --  is beyond grandiose . It is silly . <P> Clinton knew that both India and Pakistan were resisting the treaty . But treaty men are hardly deterred by such realities . The mere act of signing by the big powers and others , Clinton told the U.N . General Assembly , " will immediately create an international norm against nuclear testing , even before the treaty formally enters into force . " <P> Here in pure form is the Clinton doctrine : peace through norms . Build the norm , and they  --  the recalcitrant of the world  --  will come . They may not sign , but they will be constrained by the moral force of an international consensus they dare not defy . <P> What a vision . What an illusion . For countries like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Power , for example . Better still , thermonuclear power . <P> But the will to power is a notion utterly alien to the gentlemen and ladies of the Clinton Administration . What a retrograde , common idea . In the world of geoeconomics and globalization , of international community and cooperation , of trade and togetherness , how primitive  --  how zero-sum  --  these dreams of power . <P> Easy for us Americans to say , of course . We already have power , indeed , the pre-eminent power in the world . And we 've had it for a half-century . No wonder our elites are so bored with it , so enamored of treaties and conventions and all manner of devices that bind the world into a community of exemplary self-restraint , so contemptuous of mere striving for power and so shocked when that atavistic urge explodes in India , taking their cozy little illusions with it . <P> To India , there is nothing obsolete about raw military power . It lost a humiliating war to China in 1962 . It sees a palisade of Chinese nuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pakistan , India 's arch-enemy , with nuclear technology . Hence the bomb : to deter China , intimidate Pakistan and generally assert itself as a great power .
