They were in a bar far from home when she realized he was falling to pieces . That 's what she 'd thought . Why , he 's falling to pieces . The place was called Gary 's . <p> " Honey , " he said . He took the napkin from his lap and dipped it in his gin . He leaned toward her and started wiping her face , gently at first but then harder . " oh honey , " he said in alarm . His tie rested in his Mignon Gary as he pressed forward . He was overweight and pale but his hair was dark and he wore elegant yellow shoes . Before this , he had whispered something unintelligible to ht . No one watched them . Sweat ran down his face . His drink toppled over and fell on them both . <p> She was wearing a green dress and the next day she left it behind in the hotel along with the clothes he had been wearing , the tan suit and the tie and the yellow shoes . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in a different hotel . It was near the coast and their room had a balcony from which they could see the distant ocean . A small plane went by towing a banner which read MARCH IS LION 'S EYE BANK MONTH They knew how to drink . They sought out the slippery places , those places which tempted one to have a drink . Every place was a slippery place . The little plane slowly disappeared . <p> Denise and Steadman watched the moon rising . It grew more quiet as they listened . Denise played the game she did with herself . She transferred all her own convulsive , compulsive associations to Steadman . She gave them all to him . This was not as difficult as it might have been once because all her thoughts concerned Steadman anyway . Her mind became smooth and flat and borderless but she was n't thinking anything so she was n't lost . Then a deeper silence began to unfold and she was still all right . It became like a giant hand being mutely offered . When she sensed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was always too much for her . She went into the other room and made more drinks . They took suites whenever possible . The gin seemed to need a room of its own . She came back out to the balcony . <p> " Let 's drink this and go get something to eat , " she said . <p> They found themselves in the dining room of the hotel . It was claustrophobic and the service was insincere . They sat on a cracked red leather banquette behind which a mirror rose . on a shelf between them and the mirror lay a pair of limp rubber gloves . Denise did not bring the gloves to Steadman 's attention . She reasoned that they had been left behind by some maintenance person . They gazed at a table of seven who were telling loud stories about traffic accidents they had witnessed . They seemed to be trying to top one another with rococo descriptions . <p> The French have spectacular wrecks . . . a man said . <p> Oh , the French . . . someone said irritably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a woman said . Have you ever seen that thing ? . . . She had streaked blond hair and a heavily freckled bosom . She was attractive . Steadman would have found her attractive . <p> I saw an incredible Mexican bus crash once . . . a small man said . But his remarks were immediately dismissed by the group . <p> . . . a Mexican wreck . . . there 's nothing extraordinary about a Mexican wreck . . . <p> . . . it 's true . . . the landscape is in such avoid . . . there 's not the same effect . . . <p> Steadman and Denise listened attentively and ate bread . The woman with the freckled bosom smiled at them and Denise frowned . Personally , she did n't have a car crash story and if she ever did she would never tell it , she decided . <p> The waitress told them that the previous couple at their table had given her a five-dollar tip but had torn the bill in half so that she was faced with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despised people , present company excepted , and told them not to order the veal . If they ordered the veal , she told them , she would not serve it . They decided to have another drink and finish the bread . It grew late but no darker and they returned to their room . <p> The room was not welcoming . It had seen too many people come and go . What did it all mean anyway , this coming and going ? The room was highly reflective , though it was well aware that no special aptitude was required to be constancy reminded that time passes and everything with it , purposelessly . <p> Denise watched Steadman place himself on the bed . He lay on his back , his eyes shut . The room surrounded them . For a while , Denise lay on the bed , too , thinking Where had it gone , it had gone someplace . The way they were . Then she went into the other room where the writing table and television set were . Their glasses were there and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft , gray ones . She fumed off the lights and lay on the sofa , feeling a little dizzy . She wrung her hands and rubbed her eyes . They should go someplace , she thought . There was tomorrow , something had to be done with it . She picked over the day 's events . Her mind was like a raven picking over gravel , a raven with oily luminous feathers and a single bright eye . She could almost hear it moving across the small stones but she could n't quite , thank God . Then she heard someone passing by in the corridor , laughing . A thin breeze entered the room and she thought of the distant water as they had seen it from the balcony , folded like a package between two enormous buildings . She looked at their bags , heaped in a comer . Night was a bad time . Night would simply give her no rest . Steadman was quiet now but he might get up soon and they would have their conversation . It was a mess , they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat was dry , she hated this room . The room was cold , it did n't like them , she could hear it saying , Well there 's a pathetic pair , how did they ever find each other ? She 'd like to set fire to it . There was someone passing in the hall again , laughing , the fools . The room stared at her lidlessly Perhaps they could leave tonight . They would go down  --  Denise and Steadman , Steadman and Denise  --  past the sleepy night clerk trying to read a book  --  10,000 Dreams Interpreted , it had been once , for they had done this before , left in the night and been on their way with the setting moon falling behind the trees just as the sun was rising . She remembered the way the book looked . It was red and falling apart . She did n't like dreams . Dreams made you live alone in the future and she did n't want to , she wanted Steadman , only Steadman . But you had to be detached  --  if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she dreamt , which was n't often , it was pills and fishes . It was n't an optional thing . It was always fishes and pills . To be on their way while the moon was setting , that 's what she wanted . That was right , but was the music appropriate , that was the question . Denise giggled softly . There was no music , was the fact of it , she knew . She rolled off the couch and onto the floor . It was so quiet here , this room was not letting them breathe the way they had to , it was shameful that they 'd been given this room instead of another . Listening to Steadman breathe , she tried to breathe . She wished it were June . It was June once and they were somewhere and a mockingbird sang from midnight to daybreak or so it seemed , imitating other birds and Steadman had made a list of all the birds he recognized in the mockingbird 's song . Steadman learned things and then remembered them , that 's just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carpet toward Steadman 's bed and held onto it . His face was turned toward her , his eyes open , looking at her . That was Steadman , he knew everything but he did n't share . He made her feel like a little animal sometimes , a little animal with animal emotions , breathing animal devotion . But the heart has animal emotions is what she wanted to tell him , that 's what the heart is . . She stared back at him . She would ask him for the list very quietly , very nicely , the little piece of paper , where was it , he was always putting it someplace and she had already gone through their bags , their beautiful bright traveling bags , ready for the larger stage . That 's what it all was out there , the larger stage , and they would have to get on it again soon and meet the demands the larger stage would make . <p> " Steadman , " she said reasonably . <p> But how could he hear her , this annoying room was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known a room like this , it was n't decent , it had everything mixed up . It did n't know , what could it know ? It could n't climb from the basement into a life of spiritual sunshine like she was capable of doing , not that she had but she could . . . The individual in the hall howled with laughter at this . There were several of them out there now , a whole gang , the ones from the dinner party probably , the spectacular-wrecks people , drunk , talking about skidding and gleaming , shining really , all light . <p> At once Denise realized that the gang was herself and it was morning . Her hands hurt terribly . They were pink as though they 'd been boiled . They looked like little pies . She had hurt them somehow . Actually they were broken . Incredible . <p> She stared at them in the car on the way to the hospital . Those hands were n't going to do anything more for Denise for a while . They were through . Denise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it would n't matter to them . <p> The doctor in the emergency room wrapped them up , the left first then the right , indifferently . Even so , some things fascinated him . <p> " We 've got a kid on the third floor , " he said . " He was born with all the bones in his head broken . Now there 's a problem . Are you aware that our heads all along the line are getting smaller ? our skulls are smaller than those of our brothers in the Paleolithic period . Do you know why ? I 'll tell you why . Nobody leaves this place without a thought for the day . Society is the answer . Society has reduced our awareness skills . Personal direct contact with the natural world required a continual awareness . Now we do n't have that awareness . We are aware of click-all . " <p> Denise looked at her hands being covered with the casts . They were like little dead creatures safely concealed in a snow-covered burrow . Ugly dishes do n't break , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay alert , miss , " the doctor said , playfully slapping her hands which were now utterly exempt . <p> Then they were driving slowly through a town the hotel had not been part of . It was a southern town with little porches , the houses crowded close together . There seemed to be a lot of dogs and they all appeared to be employed in some way . That 's the way it seemed to Denise . There was a bare-cheated man so dirty he seemed to be wearing a shirt , sitting outside an empty store . The dog beside him had its leg in a cast . <p> " Look at that ! " Denise said , laughing . She pushed her hands out the window and waved at the dog as they drove by . <p> " I 'm tired , Denise , " Steadman was saying . " I 'm really tired . " <p> " Yes , yes , " Denise said . She was thinking of all the nice things she would do for Steadman whom she loved . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I think we should stay here for a while until your hands are better , " Steadman said . <p> " I agree , I agree , but no more hotels , we 'll get a house for a while . " She was crazy about him , everything was going to be fine <p> He turned off the road at a sign that said Cafe Reality and into a parking lot . Actually it said Cape Realty . Denise laughed . " And we 'll stop drinking , " Denise said . " We 'll just stop . " <p> " Sure , " Steadman said . <p> " I do n't want to see a lot of places though , " Denise said . ' You choose . " <p> She sat in the car . She had ruined that room back there . Embarrassing , she thought . But the room had fought back . It made one think , really . Her mind was still charging . Then , abruptly , it stopped . Fear filled her . Something was pouring it into her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone breakwater with the sea around it , crashing around it . <p> Steadman returned to the car and put several pictures of a house on her lap . It was private enough with a big tree in front and a pool in back and a tall whitewashed wall all around it . <p> " I 'm going to use this month wisely , " Denise assured him . <p> " Good , " Steadman said . <p> The important thing was to stop drinking . If she could get twenty-four hours away from last night , she could start stopping . Maybe they could get rid of all the glasses in the house . Glasses were always calling to you , trying to make you see things their way . Maybe this house would n't have glasses . <p> The house looked fairly good . There was shade and sun . It had everything . But why were they here ? Their drinking had brought them . Denise was determined to learn something , to go on from here , to leave this place refreshed . She yawned nervously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his jacket was dark with sweat as he lifted their bags from the trunk . <p> In one of the rooms , a young woman was sweeping the floor . " I 'm the cleaning woman , " she said . " Are you renting this place ? I 'll be through in a minute . " She wore shorts and red high-top sneakers . " I 'll put on a shirt , " she said . " I did n't know anyone was coming . I always sweep without a shirt . " With her was a small dog with black saucery eyes , thick ears , and double-dew claws . <p> " What is that ? " Denise asked . It was one of the strangest dogs she had ever seen . <p> " Everyone asks that , " the girl said happily . " It 's a Lundehund . It 's used for hunting puffins in Norway . " <p> " But what 's it doing here ? " <p> " He comes with me while I clean . You 'll probably ask next how I ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember the ins and outs of it . I started off wanting one of those Welsh corgis , the ones you always see in pictures of the Queen , greeting her on her return from somewhere or bidding her farewell as she departs . I 'm not English , of course . I 've never been to England . The Lake District , the Cotswolds , the white cliffs of Dover . . . you could n't prove any of them by me . I was born in this town and I 've never been anywhere . I do n't have the money to travel but I make sure that everything I have comes tom other places . This shirt comes from Nepal and my perfume comes from Paris . I know what you 're going to say , that it 's wrong to subject caged civet cats to daily genital scrapings just to make perfume , but it was a present . My sneakers were put together in Brazil and I know you 're going to say that Brazilian laborers make only pennies an hour , but I did buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? They come from Arizona . Navajoland . " <p> She was buttoning her shirt as she spoke and Steadman was smiling at her like a blind man . <p> Denise was not going to allow the cleaning woman to unnerve her . She had always tried to be vigilant and expectant with Steadman and it had brought them nothing but sorrow . Her hands throbbed and itched . She 'd try to sleep while it was still light and then she 'd drink a lot of water . She rubbed the dog 's ears with her casts . <p> " You should n't be here , should you , " she said to the Lundehund . " You should be scrambling up and down rocky crevices , carrying birds ' eggs in your teeth . " <p> It was disgusting and sad , Denise thought , but a great many things were . one should be used . <p> The Lundehund placed its paws on her leg and looked at her , widening its eyes and then closing them with joy . Denise did n't know what to think . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The woman and the grotesque dog were clearly catastrophes . She was trying to begin and these catastrophes appeared immediately . Though it was n't what you thought but the way you acted that was important . or was it the other way around . It could be both probably . <p> Denise turned her back on them and went into a narrow monochromatic room that overlooked the pool . There were empty bookcases over a single bed and numerous little indentations in the hardwood floor as though a woman wearing high heels in need of repair had moved back and forth , back and forth . Her own shoes were like that , too , run-down . She kicked them off . once she had been a student and then she had graduated and acquired a lot of things and tried to take care of them . She had painted things and cooked things and stuck seeds in the ground . And doing all that was the summum bonum , she had thought . But it had certainly not been the summum bonum . Then she had thrown herself into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be different here . She was going to be better Habit did n't possess the key to this place . <p> She sighed and it seemed to be later . The water in the pool was darker and the shadows were different . Her hair smelled of gin , and her skin . There was someone in the pool , a man , but he left quickly , when she got up . It was just the liquor leaving , she thought . She could understand that . The doors in the house were sliding doors and she could move them back and forth with her foot . Her hands in the casts bobbed beside her as she walked . Steadman was where she had left him but he was sitting down . The cleaning woman was holding him in her arms and he was weeping loudly . <p> Well that 's something , Denise thought . She wished that she were the sort who could weep and be held , be held and weep . But whenever she lost it , she only cried . She had never done anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw your husband , " Denise said . " He was swimming in the pool . No one should be using the pool now that we 're here , should they ? We 've rented this place after all . And we do n't need a cleaning woman either . We 'll keep it clean . This place is clean enough . " <p> " I do n't have a husband , " the cleaning woman said . " You have a husband . " Her shirt was off again , she just could n't seem to keep that shirt on . She combed Steadman 's hair back with her fingers . There was a tattoo running down the inside of her left arm . Denise had noticed something before but it had n't been a tattoo . She thought it was a long bruise . or a shadow . Some kind of a shadow that had been cast . <p> " Is that really a coffee pot tattooed on your arm ? " Denise asked . " A coffee pot and a cup of coffee ? " <p> " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Because coffee makes me really , really happy . Particularly the first couple of cups . Look , " she said , " I can make it pour . . . " She made her muscle quiver and the inked flesh moved , something seemed to pass from the representation of one object into another . <p> " That is so stupid , " Denise said . What kind of a woman would have a coffee pot tattooed on herself and go through this egregious display in front of strangers ? She bet she did it all the time , too . <p> The cleaning woman resumed stroking Steadman 's hair . His tears had dried and he looked like a boy , washed and fresh . While Denise was musing on this , the Lundehund rose softly up against her side and began chewing on the casts . He seemed to be winking at her as he did . " Get down , " the cleaning woman scolded him . " That 's a bad boy . " <p> " You should allow dogs their pleasures , " Denise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had intended this remark to make the cleaning woman sad , but everyone realized the truth of it apparently . It had no effect because it was something that was known . <p> " You 're in terrible shape , " the cleaning woman said . " Both of you . Let me come a few hours each day . I 'll make the meals and keep things tidy . I know what you 're thinking , that I 'll put poisoned mushrooms in your omelette or Succinylcholine in your seltzer and your heart will stop like that "  --  she clapped her hands together  --  " but that 's not what 's going to happen . You 're trying to kid ; the bottle and you 're trying to make predictions of what it 's going to be like , but I 'll tell you about predictions . There are seven possibilities . These apply to everything There 's maybe yes , there 's maybe no , there 's maybe yes and no , there 's maybe indescribable and then there 's three more combinations of these . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the problem lay clearly with the three combinations of the previous four . Drink , drank drunk , that 's how they had conjugated their lives , she and Steadman . But they were n't there anymore , they were here . This was the subjunctive , Denise thought . <p> " Look , " the cleaning woman said . " We 're all outsiders here . It 's going to be all right . " <p> It 's like when someone dies and someone says it 's going to be all right , Denise thought . So stupid ! <p> " We are not all outsiders , " Denise said . " If we were , we 'd be a group , then we would n't be outsiders . " This person wanted to be Steadman 's mistress , she could tell , she was pressing her lips against his temple , her long breasts lay against his shirt . But mistresses mixed cocktails and wore beautiful clothes which they knew how to take off with style . They knew about art . She could n't be Steadman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mistress of some delusion . Then things were better , and finally she persuaded the woman to leave . She did n't know how she actually managed it , but at some point the cleaning woman gathered up her things the Lundehund 's nails clicked across the floor , the door shut , and they were gone . <p> Denise looked at Steadman . She was crazy about him , she thought , just crazy about him . Though this was n't easy , this house . It was small and hot in the dark . They had n't had a drink in hours . She looked at Steadman 's watch , sixteen hours exactly . Maybe they should n't try to get better here . That was the problem with little houses . They belonged to other people , even if those other people were far away , but a hotel room did n't belong to anybody . Maybe they should find another room or maybe they should just get back in the car . This was the law of maybe , the doctrine of maybe . She believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love for Steadman and these were her beliefs . <p> She smiled at him . <p> " Denise , " he said . " Please . " <p> " You 're not in love with her , are you ? you have n't fallen in love ? " <p> " Denise , " he said , " that was a misunderstanding . " <p> " Oh , I know ! " she said brightly . <p> She was standing in the dark and he was still sitting . She wanted a drink badly . She closed her eyes and swallowed . Her mind was trying to be still , trying to be good but it was frightened . You are what you drink , she thought , you are where you drink , but here they were nothing , nowhere . They had fallen to pieces and here they were . Maybe she should say farewell to love , she thought . It gives you more poise . She should have thought of that long ago . And it prepares you , it prepares you . . . She stared doggedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , Groceries . <p> She looked at him avidly . She had been thinking about the state they were in . They executed people in this state for certain things , but before they could do it the person had to realize the importance of execution . That was the law . So of course you pretended you did n't realize the importance . As long as you could do that they had to leave you alone . <p> " So , " Steadman said , " what do you want ? " <p> It felt a little like February , actually , that forlorn , spiky , short month , but there had always been a lot to drink in February . She had n't been thinking about food , but groceries meant more than food . They were medicinal in some way and implied a plan of action . They also meant being here for some duration . Denise did not want duration here . <p> " Do n't go now , " she said . " Maybe tomorrow . We do n't need groceries now . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll be further along . There 's nothing to drink here , it 's fantastic , is n't it ? " she said . " Let 's lie down . Would you hold me ? I ca n't hold you . " <p> She raised her hands , moving them up and down a little in their white casts . She remembered a bar they had been in , was it Gary 's ? There were framed hunting and fishing pictures all over the walls . A woman was holding two snow geese by their necks . She held them high , in gloved hands , close to her head , as though they were earrings . That was Reality , Denise thought . Back there , the Bitch , reality . <p> " Where are you going ? " Denise asked . <p> " I 'm not going anywhere , " Steadman said . He ran his hands across his face . <p> " You 're not going to get a drink , are you ? " <p> " No , " Steadman said . " I am not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat on the bed . They had agreed that if one were left , the other would never come back . But one was n't left . Everything was still all right <p> She looked at the pool and saw the man again , swimming back and forth . He had no grace , Denise decided , though he swam tirelessly . Denise heard herself speaking to him , asking him to leave . She really could not have him here , he and that woman , they were making things so difficult . Be reasonable , she said . We are here . You ca n't be here while we are . She said this and that , choosing her words carefully , shouting from inside the house . The man pulled himself out of the pool and stood there dripping . He said . . . I work slowly , slowly like a hare building a pyramid . . . Denise was quite aware of what she 'd heard but she did n't believe it . She would not believe such a thing . Besides , Denise thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of what he 'd said , of course Then he crouched down and she was afraid of this , she had worried that something like this would happen , that he would begin to dismantle the pool in some way , that he would begin by pulling at the light , the big submerged light at the deep end of the pool , rotating it , twisting it out . Water was spilling and buckling everywhere , darkening the concrete , and the light was trailing its cord behind it , it was like a huge white eye on a long stalk . <p> Denise could n't stay here a moment longer . She was trembling , she had to get out . They would get in the car , she and Steadman , they would drive away and never come back . They loved driving in the dark and drinking , mixing cocktails in paper cups , driving around . They had done it a lot . They would mix up some drinks and go out and tease cars . That 's what they called it , Steadman and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of nowhere . Crazy stuff . <p> " Steadman , " she called . He knew what she wanted , he knew what they would do , that this had been a mistake . He opened the door to their car , their lovely car , and she smelled the liquor . It was in a glass from before , wedged between the seats . She picked it up with difficulty and looked at it hard , then threw it , glass and all , against the grass . <p> They drove down the street , picking up speed . They passed a house with two garbage cans on the curb and a wrought-iron sign hanging from a post . The design was of a wrought-iron palm tree and a wrought-iron sea . Below it where the custom lettering was supposed to be it said : YOUR NAME . Delightful ! Denise thought . They had ordered it just the way it had appeared in some catalogue . <p> " God , that was funny , " Denise said . People could be funny . <p> " It really was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . They were so much alike , they were just alike , Denise thought . Without the drinking king there would just be the two of them , it would be wonderful . Nothing could separate them . <p> " Roll my window down please , " she said . <p> He reached across her and did . <p> " Oh thank you , Steadman , " she said Warm humid air passed across her face , lovely air . <p> " Go faster , " she said . <p> He did . She giggled . <p> " Slow down , speed up , that road there , " she said . <p> Steadman did , he did . <p> They had left the town behind . " Turn the lights off maybe she said . <p> They rocketed down the road in the dark . <p> " Maybe turn them on again , " Denise said . What had it all meant , she wondered . <p> The road ahead was empty but behind them a car was gaining . She turned and saw the two wild lights moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . " Faster , " she said . But the car , weaving , was almost upon them and then , with a roar was beside them . It was all outside them now , everything . " There it is , Steadman , " Denise said earnestly . It was them all right . It all just hung there for an instant , clearly , then the car swerved around them , turned in inches before their front bumper , and slammed on the brakes . <p> <p> By Joy Williams <p>
