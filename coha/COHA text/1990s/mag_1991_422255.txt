Viewpoint <p> Your neighbor sells you a cheesecake that she baked in her kitchen . Your dinner guests are delighted . But they do n't know that you have been party to a black-market exchange . In most states , both you and the cook could be heavily fined . If your neighbor took the cash you paid her and deposited it in a bank , she is also a money launderer , which carries a jail term . <p> Selling food from a home is illegal . You are supposed to have a business license , your kitchen is supposed to be inspected by bureaucrats , and you are supposed to have the right kind of ovens . These regulations make it impossible to cook food for profit outside an officially-sanctioned restaurant . The purpose is allegedly to protect the consumer , but the real point is to create a cartel on behalf of the restaurant industry , and insulate it from competitive pressure . <p> In the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe , nearly all useful production comes from black markets . The same is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Peru in his book , The Other Path . <p> The term " black market " has a stigma attached to it , as if the people engaged in such activities as unlicensed baking must be stamped out . A much better term , used by most researchers in the field , is the " informal sector . " It defines that sector of all modern economies in which the exchange of ( mostly ) licit goods and services takes place through illicit means . <p> We expect the Soviet Union and other socialist economies to have large informal sectors . In some places , like the Ukraine , it is four times the size of the official economy . And we would expect to find large informal sectors in the third world as well . <p> But the informal sector thrives everywhere that government regulations , taxes , and labor laws prevent people from supplying and acquiring the goods and services they want at prices they can afford . In fact , the size of the informal sector is the perfect measure of how much a government has overstepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informal economy . Economists have n't paid much attention to it , but some recent studies have shown that in every major city , all 40 sectors of the standard industrial classification have a major informal component . The informal economy is thus a major source of our prosperity , and one of the reasons that we are not as poor as we " ought " to be , given the size , cost , and intrusiveness of government . <p> Being informal includes everything from operating without a license , to hiring nonunion employees in unionized industries , to paying less than the minimum wage , to deliberately avoiding state restaurant regulations . <p> In the informal sector , firms tend to be small so as to avoid detection . The workers tend to be undereducated and unskilled , the kind of people the unions ' minimum wage laws are intended to exclude from the market . These firms can not advertise in the open . They are characterized by shadow entrepreneurs , shadow banks , shadow workers , and shadow advertising . One 's reputation is even more important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In New York City , informal activities are rife in apparel , construction ( especially masonry , stonework , and plastering ) , footwear , toys , sporting goods , and electronics . Informal production also occurs in the manufacture of such goods as lamp shades , artificial flowers , furniture , and jewelry . <p> In New York 's construction industry , more than 90% of all interior work is done without a building permit . More than one-third of the workers in construction projects are unregistered and nonunion and therefore illicit . A majority of workers in the New York apparel industry are unregistered , and the number of informal " sweatshops " ( which pay less than the minimum wage ) has grown by 3,000% in the past two decades . <p> The electronics industry is extremely competitive in New York , and labor standards and regulations have put many firms into hard times . Rather than fight within licit markets , many have gone underground where they ignore the regulations and employ nonunion labor . <p> One way in which informal businessmen avoid detection is subcontracting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work out of their own garages and basements . The workers deliver the completed products to the main office . <p> The workplaces of these subcontractors violate every labor code in the book , but they are known for high quality , low prices , and quick service . Consumers seek them out , and would-be subcontractors ask if they too ca n't be " exploited " by having their own home business . <p> The informal sector prospers in transportation , too . There are more than twice as many " gypsy " cabs in New York as licensed ones . Huge business is done by firms that transport people through the city in convenient vans , which-though illegal-easily out-compete the inferior municipal service . Interestingly , the gypsy cabs and vans mostly serve low-income areas . <p> Most of New York 's street vendors and flea markets are unlicensed . And many high-priced jewelry and fur shops operate " informally " in the back room , where the customer pays in cash and gets a much better deal . The same is true in both high-end and low-end footwear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of auto repair shops . One survey showed that a small site in Brooklyn handled 100 cars every day-more cars than there were in the neighborhood-showing that people came from all over to enjoy the low prices and good service . <p> Miami is in a similar situation : overbearing government has created a thriving informal sector . The most common source of informalism is labor-code violations . Capitalists avoid paying overtime , allow garment workers to engage in " homework , " and employ " underaged " labor-teenagers anxious to earn money rather than take drugs or hang out on the street . <p> Nearly one-third of Miami 's Cuban immigrants began work in informal enterprises . These businesses include everything that is offered for higher prices ( with less service ) in the formal sector : services , retail , manufacturing , and construction . <p> In 1980 , the U.S. Department of Labor cracked down on Miami 's informal sector , and in a short time , discovered 132 firms violating the labor laws . The government forced the firms to pay back wages of $180 million to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise not have had jobs , were being exploited . <p> As the Miami government 's housing regulations increased during the 1960 's , Cuban immigrants began creating their own informal firms and competing for contracts to build condos in Miami Beach and office buildings in downtown Miami . When the recession hit in 1973 , formal firms were wiped out , while informal ones survived and even flourished . <p> The informal sector spans our country coast to coast . Tens of thousands of informal businesses in food preparation ( as in the cheesecake example ) , tailoring , plumbing , carpentry , auto repair , and other areas , prosper in almost every city and town in America . <p> One of the fastest growing informal activities is child care . In any immigrant neighborhood , one can find hundreds of homes spilling over with children during the day . This is a direct result of increased regulation of the industry as promoted by the established regulated firms . The child-care industry has been cartelized , with requirements that firms employ state-certified teachers , that all employees be paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of children who can be cared for in one room . Impoverished baby sitters find such regulations impossible to meet , and the people who use them are too poor to afford licit child care . <p> The informal sector serves all classes in society , but those who really depend on it for essential services like child care and transportation are the poor . The informal sector is no paradise , however . Informal firms must always be less efficient than open firms in a free market . Informal businesses must develop complicated ways of avoiding detection , which takes time and resources . They can not advertise openly . They can not merge . They must get by without the normal legal channels for settling disputes . Even though most disputes are handled peacefully , sometimes contract disputes result in violence since there is no other enforcement mechanism . <p> It is , however , instructive that informal economic arrangements work as well as they do . It should increase our skepticism about the " benefits " of government services , even those deemed " essential . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the informal sector in America , we can perform a mental experiment by imagining what would happen if all these firms were shut down in one massive federal sting operation . Our standard of living would dramatically fall . The poor would have no child care outside state provision , therefore could not work ; big construction projects would shut down ; items like sweaters would be more expensive ; transportation would dramatically decrease ; economic competition would fall ; etc . <p> Not that the U.S. government is n't trying to eliminate the informals . But it is an illusion to think that the informal economy could be wiped out through tougher enforcement . Even Stalin and Mao could n't do it . But it could be abolished peacefully by repealing the oppressive laws that create the informal sector . Such laws stay on the books not because of public demand for them , since so much of the public relies on informal exchange , but because of the continuing power of interest groups that seek protection from competition in a free market . <p> Eliminate these laws and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market , and raise everyone 's standard of living . Most importantly , we would formalize the informals and increase respect for the rule of law , which the government has done so much to undermine . <p> Reprinted , with permission , from The FreeMarket , a publication of the Ludwig Von Mises Institute , Auburn University , Auburn , Alabama 36849-5301 . <p> By William Tucker <p> <p> Mr. Tucker , author of The Excluded Americans : Homelessness and Housing Policies ( Regnery Gateway , 1990 ) , is a New York City-based journalist . <p>
