Contents* * * # Captain Paradox 's calls always came at the most inopportune times . Fiona and I had just collapsed , en-twined together on her cool sheets , after a show , a quick Moroccan dinner , yet another argument about my lifestyle , and finally a furious bout of lovemaking . Sleep was settling over my eyes like a heavy gauze when the beeper I 'd left on the dresser made its distinctive " ping ! " sound . <p> " Do n't answer , Craig , " she groaned , grabbing my arm . <p> I carefully disentangled myself from the sheet , and from Fiona . " I 'm afraid I have to . " I began to put on my trousers , started searching for my shoes . <p> " A story ? " <p> I nodded , trying not to look guilty . I hated lying to her . <p> " Could be a Pulitzer , " I said , as always . I donned my shirt and shoes and kissed her on the forehead . She was still pouting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another perfectly wonderful Sunday , ruined . <p> The morning sun was just beginning to paint the sky yellow and blue . I ducked into ' an alley half a block from Fiona 's apartment . No one was there . <p> " Is it bad , Paradox ? " I said into the beeper after thumbing the transmit button . <p> " It 's bad all right , " came Paradox 's deep resonant voice , preternaturally clear even through the tiny speaker . He always sounded like he was doing an impression of Sergeant Preston of the Mounties . But Captain Paradox was the genuine article . He really , actually , genuinely sounded like that . <p> It scared me sometimes . <p> " How bad ? " I asked , as if I did n't know what he was going to say next . <p> " I have finally finished my work on the Probability Key , " he said , his voice a dignified , rolling ocean . " At long last we can begin to make the ... adjustments we 've discussed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's the bad news , sir ? " <p> The Captain 's voice took on the somber tones of the sepulcher . " Thibodeaux is back , " he said . " He wants the Key , lad , and very badly . His appearance will either bring our plan to a swift denouement , or else it will destroy it utterly . Get here as quickly as you can , Quantum Boy . " <p> Dramatic , as always . But it did n't sound good . I flicked another button on the beeper , releasing a minute trace of the quantum foam from its magnetic bottle . Frost-bitten millipedes ran up and down my spine as probabilities rearranged themselves . My jacket and slacks liquefied and flowed around me , then solidified into a familiar skin-tight lemon-lime costume . <p> " On my way , " I said and stuffed the beeper into a belt-pouch . My cape billowed with a flourish as I vaulted into the brightening sky , meditating on how much I had come to hate the name " Quantum Boy . " <p> Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the facade of a third-floor apartment on Portland 's fashionable Northwest 23rd Avenue . The Captain 's discretion , outright secrecy really , is n't all that unusual for a Super . It 's been de rigueur for the Super lifestyle since the Great Lawrence Whoops created most of us back in the early 1970 's . <p> In those early days , Supers had been considered freaks , heresies , even blasphemies . Now , only a couple of short yearns remain on the Millennial clock . To some , the Supers represent salvation . Others see us as the Horsemen of the Apocalypse . <p> The Willamette River sparkled serenely beneath me , and for a moment I recaptured the heady adolescent thrill of flight for its own sake . I stretched my body taut in the wind , limbs outstretched like a child imitating an airplane . I watched the river , as yet undisturbed by boats , as it dropped away behind me . <p> The early-morning traffic had already begun its westward bustle across the Morrison and Burnside Bridges . Horns honked and arms gestured from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> My flight path curved downward over the avenues of the Northwest quadrant of Portland . I grazed the rooftops and could see a few early risers unlocking their offices and storefronts , getting ready for the day . A heavyset woman in a flower-print dress looked up and saw me , an " 0 " of surprise instantly forming on her lips . A block away , a paperboy on a mountain bike flung a newspaper and gestured a one-handed " thumbs-up " to me . Across the street , a dour-faced man in a business suit flipped me the hairy bird . <p> I decided to ignore my adoring public and concentrate on the improbable act of flying . I knew as well as anybody that Supers have threatened public safety as often as they 'd preserved it , so it never surprised me that certain folks had no use for us , whatever our ideology . <p> Their resentment is understandable . These days , it seems all I ever read about in the papers are stories of meta-human thieves , terrorists , and world-beaters and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or killed , or driven off by the more altruistic Supers . Other times , there simply are n't enough benevolent Supers around to land the crippled jet , or to defuse the terrorist 's bomb , or to keep the downtown skyscraper from being anti-gravved from its foundations into Low Earth Orbit . On occasions such as these , a whole lot of civilians are toast . Their resentment is understandable . <p> I could see from the air that half of Captain Paradox 's roof was missing , flensed from the four walls as though by some impossibly sharp carving knife . I could see into the lab , which resembled a three-dimensional cutaway diagram , strewn with upended computer equipment . My pulse raced . What the hell could have done this ? <p> I touched down , landing in a careful crouch on the roof of the Captain 's lab . <p> I pulled the beeper out , whispered into it . " Captain Paradox ? " I tried again . Nothing . I closed my eyes behind the little domino mask and saw Fiona , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was I still doing this shit at thirty ? Taking a deep breath , I very deliberately jumped through the gap in the roof , my cape trailing behind me like an emerald contrail . <p> The lab had evidently been ransacked in a hurry during the ten minutes it had taken me to fly from Southeast Portland across the Willamette and north along the shore into the Northwest quadrant . Computers and monitors and glass piping and aluminum conduits were scattered and shattered , as though they had been not only thrown about by something strong and malevolent , but had also exploded from within . But there was no sign of anyone else in the room . <p> I wondered which of Captain Paradox 's many foes could have been responsible . There was no shortage of hostile Supers whom Paradox had , over the years , given cause for revenge . The colossal destruction was consistent with some of the physically powerful Supers , like Red Rampage or Pallet Jack . I tried to cross at least a few of Paradox 's enemies off the list : If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was likely that nothing would remain of the whole block but a crater lined with radioactive glass . T.E.N.D.R.I.L. agents were usually more subtle than this , but who knew ? <p> I wondered if a clever scientific-Super , somebody like Vitriol or Wishcraft , might camouflage his search of the place with gratuitous destruction , simply to throw me and Paradox off his scent . <p> Then I noticed Captain Paradox 's costume lying amid the rubble . The cowl , the red tights , and the yellow gloves and boots were all attached , as though he had been standing in the lab in full costume when ... <p> I carefully picked the costume off the floor , and reached into its still-attached utility belt . A few white crystals , like sugar cubes , pattered from the limp scarlet cowl to the floor . I dropped the costume then , in revulsion . <p> " Welcome to your death , " rasped a sandpaper voice from behind me . I had n't seen him standing there , but it stood to reason that I could n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what had evidently happened here so very recently . That would have been ... improbable , to say the least . <p> " Professor Thaddeus Thibodeaux , " I said , feigning calm . I turned very deliberately toward him , watching him carefully . I wanted to be ready for anything any quick motion , any sudden grab for a weapon . <p> He smiled , reptile-like . I thought of the Grinch as he made a deep , mock-courteous bow . He was thin , old , cadaverous . Thibodeaux could only be described as classically , melodramatically Evil . <p> I tried to sound threatening . " What the hell have you done with Captain Paradox ? If you 've hurt him , I swear ... " <p> Thaddeus Thibodeaux tsk-tsked at me , still grinning that nasty grin . " My boy , " said Thibodeaux in that oh-so-carefully cultivated mid-Atlantic accent . " The man to whom you refer is , or rather was  --  how shall I say it  --  always an unlikely sort . Now , it appears he has at last been rendered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thibodeaux a brief advantage , which he pressed . He produced a small pistol from inside his tidy white lab coat . He leveled it at my mid-section . I tensed , but did n't move . Nearly twenty feet separated us . Could I close the distance before he nailed me ? <p> I had to keep him talking . Buy some time . " Why , Thibodeaux ? You 've always had more class than this . First you wreck Captain Paradox 's lab . Then , you threaten me with a pistol . It 's not your style . " <p> Thibodeaux marginally lowered the gun . I heaved an inner sigh of relief that I hoped he would n't notice . I knew that villains can never refrain from talking about themselves , or resist describing the minutiae of their plans for world domination . <p> Thibodeaux chuckled almost benevolently . " There are a great many , myself included , " he said , " who would happily kill both you and Captain Paradox to obtain his most puissant weapon : the Probability Key . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty , Craig , " Fiona had said over a mouthful of grape leaf-wrapped dolma . " It 's silly for you to still be running all over the country to write stories about this superannuated Saturday matinee hero and his teen sidekick . " <p> I tried to pat her hand , but she pulled it away . " It 's important work , " I said lamely , ending in a shrug while she chewed very slowly and glowered at me . <p> Important work ? Maybe . Improbable work ? Certainly . It was improbable that news editors continued to pay such good money for stories about the Supers years after they had become commonplace . I sometimes wondered if that 's as improbable as having a fiancee who does n't recognize you just because you happen to be wearing tights and a domino mask . <p> " It 's not real life , Craig , " she said . Her eyes were getting very blue and moist . " Real life is settling down , getting married . Kids , maybe . A career with some predictability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runners , or nearly getting sacrificed to some volcano god for the sake of a few exclusive photos . " <p> I did n't have an answer for her . And I could n't tell her the real truth . Captain Paradox needed me . The universe needed me . <p> Getting shot might have been a less painful option than the one I chose . But instead of absorbing the bullet , I concentrated with every erg of power at my disposal on Thibodeaux 's gun-hand . With a cry , the stick-thin old man dropped the gun to the wreckage-strewn lab floor . He clutched his useless right hand , which now resembled a sea lion 's flipper , in his other hand . <p> Altering probabilities to the extent of actually changing the shape of an adversary 's body had always put a huge strain on me . Besides being contrary to the Captain 's overly solicitous sense of heroic ethics . Still , it was n't something I 'd do lightly , at least under normal circumstances . Captain Paradox had always cast a long , moderating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stood face to face with the man who in all likelihood had just killed Captain Paradox . I walked over to Thibodeaux , trying not to weave as I moved . I summoned all my remaining strength and grasped the old man by his collar , dragging him to his feet . <p> " I ought to finish you right now for what you 've done to Captain Paradox , " I hissed . How many times had Captain Paradox sagaciously talked me down from this precipice ? <p> Thaddeus Thibodeaux only laughed , but with an incongruously beneficent tone . He dropped his left hand into his coat pocket . I grabbed his wrist , felt the bones creak and grind like dry kindling . Something was in his pocket , a weapon perhaps , and I wanted to see it . I released his wrist and pulled the object from the depths of his jacket , letting Thibodeaux crumple to the lab floor . <p> It was a foot-long , notched metal rod , and it gleamed an unnaturally bright silver . It should have weighed ten pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . I remembered some of Captain Paradox 's pedantic descriptions of the thing 's inner workings : super-light wafers , separated by a mere hydrogen atom 's width . Quantum effects . My eyes widened behind the opaque white eye-slits of the domino mask . An errant wind from outside the ruined ceiling made my cape rustle and whisper around my knees . <p> I 'd never held the thing in my hands before , or even seen it up close . But I knew it had to be Captain Paradox 's Probability Key . <p> Thibodeaux sneered up at me from the floor . But his face did n't bear quite the same hatred I remembered from our every other encounter . From the time I 'd first seen Thibodeaux 's wrinkled death 's head expression , it had imprinted itself on me as the very definition of evil . <p> I 'd been a little kid back then . Was it pity I saw now in his eyes , rather than malice ? <p> " You jock-strapped idiots , " he said , shaking his head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think this is the way the world is really supposed to be ? Endless , inconclusive fights between costumed heroes and costumed villains ? <p> " Before the Great Whoops , the world made sense . A prosaic , dull sort of sense , but the universe at least had a kind of dignity . Little triumphs counted for something . Gods in spandex could n't move planets from their orbits on a whim . " <p> I swallowed , but my throat felt like a gravel road . I remembered when the world made sense , too . And I remembered being a kid . A misfit teen who saw in the newly changed post-Whoops world a way out . A kid for whom saving the world with Captain Paradox became both a divine calling and a source of entertainment that not even the very best comic books and video games could provide . <p> " You were there beside Paradox when the Whoops happened , were n't you ? " Thibodeaux said . " He was your uncle , and your late mother had placed you in his care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ? When had he had time to raid the Captain 's private files ? Before Captain Paradox had become Captain Paradox , back when he was simply Dr. Harold Harwood , he had led a research project at the Lawrence Livermore Lab in Northern California . Uncle Harry had been studying the quantum foam that underlies the universe itself . He 'd described the quantum foam as " the mattress-pad upon which the fitted sheets and blankets of reality are stretched . " Whatever , I had thought at the time . All I remembered of the project was a lot of uninteresting math and a really cool-looking particle-accelerator ring at the lab . <p> And , of course , I remembered being in that lab on the day an O-ring blew and a batch of quantum foam accidentally got into the ground water , forever altering the laws of probability and the fundamental physics of the universe . The Supers were born that day . The good ones and the bad ones both . <p> " Your uncle Harry was n't a very responsible guardian , " continued Thibodeaux @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident . Dr. Harwood knew perfectly well what he was doing . He was rewriting the rules of the universe to make it more to his liking . He wanted a world where everything made sense in terms of black and white . Heroes and villains . What could be more simple ? <p> " But he could n't get it quite right on that first attempt . The comic-book world he 'd dreamed of was too complex . Too many variables . Too many loose cannons to lash down , too many Supers who refused to behave themselves . He needed to make another , more careful attempt at omnipotence . " <p> I turned the silver key over and over in my hands . It seemed to twist in my grasp , as though it contained restless energies that would n't sit still for long . <p> " Look well at the Key , Quantum Boy , " Thibodeaux said , a sneer creeping into his voice as he uttered the name . Or was that just me ? " And think about it . You hold the key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can live in Paradox 's fantasy , or you can recast the universe into something saner . The decision is yours . " <p> Decisions . I knew I did n't want to face any momentous decisions . At least not without asking the Captain for some guidance . If only he had n't been reduced to a handful of sugar-cubes , I maundered . I felt like a weakling for thinking that , and hated myself for it . <p> Then a deep , familiar voice boomed from behind me . <p> " Good work , Quantum Boy . I see you 've recovered the Probability Key . And that Thibodeaux has yet to corrupt its energies . Get ready , Quantum Boy . " <p> Captain Paradox stood whole , inexplicably restored . He was a few meters from where he had apparently fallen , and now showed no signs of the odd crystallization effect . Paradox 's red and yellow uniform was immaculate , scarcely wrinkling even at the bending places . His eyes twinkled beneath his ocher-colored cowl and his cape tossed and swirled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hole in the ceiling . It was as though all reality had shifted itself , just for me . <p> Oh , I thought , pondering Thibodeaux 's useless right arm and the nearly weightless , pulsating metal I held in my hand . <p> " Nuts ! " hissed Thaddeus Thibodeaux . His trademark . <p> I ignored him , and noticed that my jaw was hanging slackly . Nothing connected with my adventures with Captain Paradox ought to surprise me , I thought . <p> " ' Get Ready ' ? " I asked . <p> " Prepare to focus your probability-altering abilities through the Key . This will realign all Probability , as we 've discussed . It looks like your powers have already triggered the Key 's energies . Can you feel it powering up ? " <p> I could , and nodded . <p> " Once the Key is completely activated , " said Captain Paradox , " we 'll only have one chance at this , you know . " <p> I nodded mutely . I was Quantum Boy , after all . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who always spoke in those quaint " as I 'm sure you 're already aware , professor " cliches . <p> " Sure , Captain Paradox , " I said , grasping the slender metal stick in hands that felt slick and clammy inside the lime-colored gloves . My eyes screwed themselves tightly shut behind the domino mask . I tried to concentrate on the Probability Key , on what I knew it could do . On Captain Paradox 's careful lessons . <p> I opened my eyes to see Captain Paradox standing over Thibodeaux . The white lab coat hung on the wretched little man like a becalmed sail . <p> " There are too many Supers who take no responsibility for their abilities , " said Paradox . He was using his now world-famous Lecturing Voice . " Too many who , like you , would run roughshod over the helpless billions . The Great Origin has given the world a few very powerful men and women who seek only justice . But it has also unleashed incalculable evil and destruction . " <p> The Captain had never permitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his presence . Supers are a gift from Fate , not an accident to be regretted , he had told me on several occasions . <p> The metal rod began to vibrate in my hand . It grew warm . I continued to concentrate , with difficulty . <p> The Captain continued to lecture . He could n't help himself . <p> " Now , we can undo the evils wrought by misguided meta-humans , " Captain Paradox said . " The Probability Key can adjust the Great Origin very slightly . It can turn the tide . It can increase the heroes-to-villains ratio . " <p> Thibodeaux smiled grimly up at the hero towering over him . " Why stop there ? " he asked , chuckling . " Why not simply redirect the quantum foam to write us over completely ? Why not fill the world entirely with spandex-clad do-gooders ? " <p> Captain Paradox began stroking his smooth bridge-abutment of a chin as though actually considering this . Absurdly , I wondered how the woman in the flower-print dress , or the man who 'd given me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying across the Portland skyline . <p> The rod tried to wrench itself out of my grip . I continued to concentrate on holding on to it , but more unbidden , distracting images appeared before me . <p> I imagined myself sixty years old . Captain Paradox still calls me Quantum Boy . <p> I saw Fiona , her pretty features sullied by a frown . She scolding me for being an irresponsible Pet . er Pan . Me deserving it . Where was she going to fit in inside the juvenile paradise Paradox must be envisioning at this moment ? <p> Where was I going to fit in ? <p> I could barely hold onto the Probability Key anymore . I grasped at it with two hands , both of which were becoming numb with the strain . I concentrated on holding on . The sound of thunder surrounded me , centering on the slender cylinder in my hands . <p> Captain Paradox 's voice sliced through the other distractions . " The power 's got to be released , boy ! We 've only one shot at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boy ! Make a wish ! " <p> " Be careful what you wish for , " I thought I heard Thibodeaux rasp . But I could n't be sure . <p> I closed my eyes , wished hard , and let go of the rod . I heard a thunderclap and then a <p> tinkling sound as though something fragile had been smashed with great force into a linoleum floor . <p> Something had . The pink earthenware coffee cup had launched like a projectile from my soap-slicked hands right onto the kitchen floor . <p> " Goddammit , " I said . That had been my favorite coffee cup . I concentrated on the moist shards on the floor for a long moment , willing them to reassemble . <p> Nothing . I smiled . I tossed the shards into the trash and rinsed off two other coffee mugs and Fiona 's fancy doo-hickey that made such wonderfully neat , even slices of cheese . The toast popped and the kettle began to whistle . Quiet feet padded into the kitchen , approaching me from behind . Gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fiona said . " You 're making me breakfast ? " <p> I smiled over my shoulder at her . " You sound surprised . " <p> " You never make me breakfast . Besides , you said you had to answer a call . A big story . Maybe a Pulitzer . " She made a face when she said " Pulitzer , " one of my wearisome , oft-repeated bullshit-words . <p> " I decided not to take the call , " I said . " I think I 'm going to go look for a job , instead . Or maybe a few nice , safe freelance writing projects I can tackle at home . " <p> Fiona 's eyes were bigger than the saucers I set on the kitchen table . She did n't speak as I opened the drapes over the kitchen sink and opened the window , letting the morning in . The gauzy curtains billowed gently in the breeze , like Captain Paradox 's cape . <p> Ping ! <p> I noticed then that my beeper was on the kitchen table . Had I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself to the bathroom while Fiona poured the coffee . <p> " Quantum Boy ! " crackled Captain Paradox 's voice , echoing very faintly . " Thibodeaux must have used the Probability Key against us somehow . Everything is dark . I do n't know where I am ... " <p> I was n't enjoying this . Captain Paradox should sound strong . Confident . This was the voice of a lost waif . I realized then that to Captain Paradox , super-heroing had become everything . It had been his entire world . In a world without Supers , how would he survive ? <p> " Um , I think something 's gone wrong with the Key , " I said . I probably did n't sound very convincing . <p> " It 's Thibodeaux , " Captain Paradox said , almost too faintly to hear . " Find him , Quantum Boy . Find him ! " <p> I grimaced , and flicked the beeper off . Quantum Boy . Shit . <p> I 'll find him all right . <p> I returned to the kitchen table and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of her coffee cup . <p> " Let 's get married , " she said . <p> I raised an eyebrow , then said , " Okay . " My lips started to curl into what felt like a smile . <p> I sipped my coffee and munched a piece of toast while flipping through the telephone directory I 'd propped on my knee . I scanned the " Th " section in the white pages . <p> " If we 're going to get married , we ought to think about the finances , " I said . <p> " Who are you looking up.Z " <p> Ah , there it is . Thibodeaux , Thaddeus . <p> " Just an old colleague , " I said . " I 'll bet money he 's looking for a new line of work right about now , too . " <p> Portrait of a Paradox : The Life and Times of Dr. Harold Harwood . I already had the title down . I figured I could use plenty of primary sources , like Thibodeaux . Maybe even a co-biographer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinosaurs : People would enjoy reading about them a lot more than they would being threatened by them . I had a feeling that once everybody understood that the Supers were safely dead , confined now to the four-color pages where they belonged , the book could sell millions . <p> I reached for the telephone . <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> <p> By Michael A.
