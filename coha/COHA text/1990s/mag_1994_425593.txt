The Road to Cairo The Pope undermines the case against population control by accepting leftist economic assumptions . <p> IT 'S NOT OFTEN that a Pope achieves consensus , but John Paul II has managed to do it on the issue of population . Not within his Church , mind you  --  even Popes do n't expect that kind of miracle . But within the reigning Kultur there is nearly universal agreement : if the nations of the world are to ratify an ambitious plan to redefine norms of family and sexuality , and commit their governments to ambitious spending programs to back it up , this Pope has to be dealt with . The plan is the draft program of action for the UN-sponsored International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo in mid September , and by calling into question some of its provisions John Paul threatens to spoil what was supposed to be one large party . <p> In so doing he has concentrated on his person the full wrath of everyone from the prestige press and the Green movement to the UN and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pope in their columns and editorials ( and you can count his defenders on one hand ) , virtually all have taken the ad hominem route , portraying him as an old fuddy-duddy who simply can not deal with the reality of sex . Even the highbrow Economist found room for an editorial called Condom conundrums ' arguing that behind the Pope 's teaching was the truth that sex , in the eyes of the Vatican 's rump of greybeards and nitpickers , is still the great monster that must be kept beyond the gate . ' Only slightly more elevated , the Washington Post 's Hobart Rowan opined that with the passing of the Soviet empire , the church has lost the ' glue ' of opposition to Communism upon which it relied to unite the faithful ' and is thus in the market for a new devil . <p> Here in Hong Kong the Eastern Express picked up a Guardian story under the headline Pope teams up with Iran hardliners . ' And no Inquisition would be complete without the ritual denunciations from the media 's house Catholics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Free Choice held a press conference to explain that the Pope did not represent Catholics , it was deemed worthy of coverage ( Vatican Out of Step on Birth Control , Group Finds ' ' ) . An umbrella group called Catholics Speak Out received reams of coverage simply by planning to take out a full-page ad in the New York Times . According to the text of the proposed advertisement , the Pope 's teaching is a marginal minority view in our church , defended largely by a male celibate hierarchy . ' <p> But top prize belongs to the Christian Science Monitor . Like the others it has dutifully reported the Pope 's obstinacy and respectfully quoted all the usual suspects . But it also ran a photo whose caption says it all : A Filipino family poses inside their home in a Manila slum . In the Philippines and elsewhere , the Roman Catholic Church has criticized efforts to promote birth control . ' Get it ? The Pope is keeping people poor . A Question of Morality ? <p> TO MOST of these people the Pope 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Victorian prudishness . There is no small irony in these public treatments , for they demonstrate that in less than half a century the Catholic Church in America has gone from Maria Monk and the Whore of Babylon to the Church of Impossibly Strict Standards , a change that probably tells us more about society than it does about the Church 's relative position in it . Even those who have not been radicalized , some of whom might even have some admiration for the Pope , tend to see his attacks on Cairo as stemming from a theological opposition to homosexuality , birth control , and , of course , abortion . They have it wrong . It is not the Pope 's objection to birth control or abortion that is driving his attacks on Cairo but rather the long-standing orthodox Christian view of life and sexuality and their relation to a healthy society that is driving his views on homosexuality , birth control , and abortion . In short it is a collision of irreconcilable world views , a collision the Pope appears destined to lose , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testament to this Pope 's dedication to his role as pastor that he has evidently decided that losing well and clearly may be the best service he can render a world unwilling to acknowledge the truths he has to tell it . <p> There is little new in what the Pope is saying . What has brought the controversy to a head is the meeting in Cairo , the third such conference since 1974 . There delegations from 170 countries will consider a draft program intended to do for population what the Earth Summit did for the environment : ratify a large list of freshly discovered rights , ' a government-sponsored plan of action to implement them , and , naturally , commitments of billions of dollars from the world 's taxpayers to pay for it all . Battle Lines Drawn <p> John Paul fully understands what is at stake here . So do his opponents . The global push for population control began at the first UN conference on the issue in Bucharest in 1974 , a time when statements like the first sentence in Paul Ehrlich 's best-selling book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is over '  --  were still taken seriously . At the second conference , ten years later in Mexico City , it was another story . The Reagan Administration got the conference to agree that abortion should not be promoted as a means of family planning and that population growth itself was a neutral ' factor in economic development . <p> This was followed by the cut-off of U.S. taxpayer dollars to groups like the UN Fund for Population Activities ( UNFPA ) because of their support for programs , like China 's , that were characterized by forced abortions and sterilizations . This time around the population-control enthusiasts are much better prepared , and with a friendly Administration in the White House they smell victory . Rather than take the issue head on , they have wisely opted to get what they want by co-opting language on the family and shifting the focus of the debate to choice ' and women 's empowerment . ' <p> Abortion is a good example of this back-door approach . Although Bill Clinton told a group of seminary students at the Vatican that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a means of birth control or population control , ' he has been contradicted by his press spokesman , Dee Dee Myers ; by his own representative to the conference , former Senator Tim Wirth ; and by the State Department 's recent cable on Administration policy to all American diplomats , informing them that the U.S. supports universal access to family planning and reproductive health services , including safe access to abortion . ' Naturally such a universal commitment is impossible without public funding , though it is much nicer to get your way on sensitive issues without having to say exactly what it is you want . And they looked set to get it in Cairo . <p> Until John Paul stepped in . Over the past few months the Pope has focused on Cairo in a way that he has on no other issue save perhaps the clash between freedom and totalitarianism . He perceives that there is more than meets the eye to terms like reproductive rights for all people , ' sexual health , ' diversity of family forms , ' and target audiences , particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the draft . Almost weekly he or his proxies have raised public objections , and they have not minced words . Biological colonialism , ' the Pope called it in July . This was followed by a declaration offered by John Cardinal O'Connor and endorsed by 113 of his fellow cardinals attacking the draft for trying to impose the failed social policies ' of the West on the Third World . Most recently the Pope 's spokesman declared that what is at stake in Cairo is the future of humanity . ' <p> Missing from the press accounts is any discussion of the world view that lies behind John Paul 's unrelenting protest . This is scarcely the Pope 's fault . His views were set out plainly in a document called Ethical and Pastoral Dimensions of Population Trends , released in March by the Pontifical Council for the Family . Grounded in Genesis , the orthodox Christian view is that man was made in the image of his Creator , that this Creator gave him an Earth that he should subdue and exercise dominion over , and that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it good . ' These ideas have serious implications , not least for how we as societies pursue our interests and what those interests are . <p> Two dimensions of this understanding are relevant here . First , private morality . Like most such documents , the Cairo draft claims to be morally neutral . Much of what is proposed in it under the guise of social science has already become accepted in America , where public discourse about sexuality has become entirely a matter of mechanics ; the only question we dare ask is whether it is safe . ' Orthodox Christian teaching , by contrast , grounds the sexual act in the love between husband and wife and the commitment of marriage . <p> One way to think of it is to compare it to an athlete 's regimen . Without an understanding that exercise , diet , and avoidance of smoking are intended to make the body function better  --  indeed , to help the body function as it ought  --  things like push-ups would appear a form of masochism . And without an understanding that Christian teachings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proscriptions against birth control , premarital sex , and the like come across as an arbitrary catechism of don'ts ' designed to frustrate natural desires . In the areas of love , marriage , and the dignity of the person , the Pope has been at his most eloquent , and he is absolutely right to see the UN 's calls for adolescent access to contraception , its references to the family , in all its forms , ' and its stress on individuals rather than couples as an attempt to prescribe the Swedish model for the Third World . The Public Dimension <p> YET AS critical as this personal dimension might be to understanding the Church 's position on population control , the social dimension demands equal consideration . It may even be more important , at least in terms of the argument at Cairo , for the push to commit the world 's governments to intruding into areas they have traditionally held as beyond their bounds would enjoy no public support were it not for the idea that the development of impoverished peoples depends on such intrusion . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dubious science and bogus economics that lie behind such an assumption . Here in Asia , home to the world 's fastest-growing economies , the problem facing its now affluent societies is how to arrest the decline in their birth rates ; countries that once encouraged people to have fewer children are now begging them , often with tax incentives , to have more ( Go for three , ' runs the Singapore slogan ) . Even China , with its immense population , is a far more complicated case than the experts care to admit . In booming Canton , a province of 66 million , the opening to markets has brought about a labor shortage , to the point where Canton has had to import some 10 million workers from other provinces . To put that in perspective , it means that a province with the population of the Philippines has in the course of 15 years of market reforms created work not only for all its own people but for another cohort equal to the working population of Malaysia . As a whole , China will continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country opens up as well . But if these reforms do in fact continue , it may be a very different story two decades from now . <p> What does any of this have to do with Church teaching ? What the Church teaches on the personal level must be consistent with what it teaches on the social level . No one would deny that anyone who has children must , at least in the short term , give up some of his wealth to care for them , and in certain cases this may represent a personal hardship . An unmarried teenager who became pregnant , for example , would find her options circumscribed . The Church may well answer that she would not be justified in making an innocent life , a new third party , pay for her irresponsibility . But can the Church really teach that society is left worse off when one of its members does the right thing ? That would be a profound contradiction of natural law . But this is the message when the Pope accepts , or appears to accept , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> John Paul has undermined his own teaching by acknowledging a problem for which he then rules out the solution . His view is based on an incomplete understanding of wealth , an inclination to judge a society 's virtue by its level of government spending , and a tendency to believe that many of the problems of the undeveloped world can be blamed on the greed ' of the West , rather than on the protectionist and collectivist policies of Third World countries . Above all he is wont to say capitalism ' when he probably means materialism , ' as if there were no difference between the two and as if capitalism itself were not threatened by materialism . <p> True enough , this Pope has been far more sensitive than his predecessors to the role of markets and especially the importance of entrepreneurship , and his Centesimus Annus is a classic ( not least for its sharp turn away from previous Church thinking on economics ) . But even Centesimus Annus has some odd bits : the Pope 's call for international solidarity as a requirement for development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosperity of the developed world comes at the expense of the Third World . Similar statements run all through other papal documents , notably Sollicitudo Rei Socialis , which reduces the great engine of capitalism to the all-consuming desire for profit ' and expresses John Paul 's solid conviction that what is hindering full development is that desire for profit . ' Papal Nonsequitur <p> THIS LACK of understanding has led to a distressing Bush-like tendency to hop on the wrong train and then try to hop off before it arrives at its inevitable destination . Let me cite just one example . Back in December 1989 , I received a phone call from Bishop James McHugh of Camden , New Jersey . For years Bishop McHugh has been one of the Church 's point men on population issues , especially vis-a-vis the UN , and he has performed this task with courage and conviction . The day he called he was upset by an editorial in the Philadelphia Inquirer . Called The Pope 's Omission , ' the editorial was pegged to a recent papal message on the environment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement , it called him to account for his opposition to birth control , which Inquirer editors saw as essential to any solution to environmental problems . The editorial went further , attacking the Bush and Reagan Administrations for their denial of funds to the UNFPA on the basis of its involvement in China 's population program . <p> Bishop McHugh was rightly agitated . Would I perhaps like to offer the Inquirer a column on the subject along with Julian Simon , who had also read the editorial ? We did , though it never ran . And I 'm not sure the good bishop would have been pleased if it had . For while we were dead opposed to the editorial 's substance , its logic was flawless . If all the things the Pope has said in his World Day messages were in fact true  --  that there has been a progressive decline in the quality of life , ' that developed nations must curb their greed because it is hurting the undeveloped world , that the Earth is suffering ' from this over-consumption  --  then the Inquirer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will get . <p> No serious economist , at least no serious free-market economist , accepts these problems as defined ( much less the proposed solutions ' ' ) , and that little , unnoticed fact is well worth considering . You do not see Milton Friedman or Gary Becker on the front lines of the population-control movement , whatever their own convictions might be about birth control or abortion in personal life . To the contrary , the more free-market the economist is , the more he recognizes that in an open market each additional person necessarily produces more than he consumes  --  or he would never be paid . Obversely , it is no coincidence that those thumping for a state role in controlling population promote a state role in lots of other things too . The same Catholics Speak Out ad that called for a male celibate hierarchy ' to get in the ballgame on sex cited , in the very next sentence , the need to redistribute ' resources . <p> Thus the Pope only complicates things when he admits to grave and serious problems ' caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have as many children as they see fit given their circumstances . Worse still has been the failure to address head on the frankly pagan assumptions of the environmental movement , especially its insistence that everything is getting worse , not better . In fact , life expectancy in both the developed and the undeveloped worlds has been rising dramatically . As Julian Simon puts it , we face an epidemic of life . ' <p> It 's also a mistake for the Pope or the Vatican to endorse the Left-environmentalist argument that the economic problems of the undeveloped countries arise from the fact that the developed countries consume most of the world 's wealth . What this argument ignores is the fact that the developed countries also produce most of the world 's wealth . If wealth were to be redistributed ' by some central authority , much of it would never be produced in the first place . <p> Whatever else it may be , capitalism at its heart celebrates life and man 's ability to create . To the welfare state another person means another mouth ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Back-Door Option <p> MUCH of the confusion over these issues is understandable . Not a small part of it is deliberate . For the one thing the cultural elites have learned is that they can not win by openly calling for state intrusion into intimate areas like sexuality and the family . As Gunnar Myrdal realized years ago , the population question could be transformed into the most effective argument for a thorough and radical socialist remodeling of society . ' The key to this is not attacking traditional values but appearing to adopt them while in fact emptying them of their traditional meaning and filling the vacant place with choice , ' empowerment , ' public health , ' and families , in all their forms . ' <p> If he had not realized it before , John Paul must now appreciate that he is up against something far more powerful than Communism . By the time Karol Wojtyla became John Paul II , Communism was a dead religion . What we have with the effort to control is a living heresy : a mechanistic view of man and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population and the environment and wealth emanate from these premises just as surely as the Pope 's do from his . <p> John Paul has picked up the standard here when all those around him in public life have retreated . In so doing he has been forced , time and again , to return to the Church 's timeless views on man , his relation with his fellows , and their relation with this world . Probably John Paul is doomed to lose this battle , at least in the sense that the delegates at Cairo will pass their plan of action with or without him . Yet by insisting on a different view , he has at least joined the argument and forced out into the open issues that his opponents had hoped would remain hidden . <p> In his courageous opposition to all that Cairo stands for , John Paul well understands who his enemies are . How much better he could resist them if he could learn to recognize some of his friends . <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> By WILLIAM MCGURN <p> <p> Mr. McGurn is senior editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
