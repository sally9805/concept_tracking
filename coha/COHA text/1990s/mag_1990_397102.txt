THERE 'S SOMETHING ABOUT MAPS DEPICTING CALIFORNIA AS AN ISLAND THAT APPEALS TO ANTHONY FRANK , POSTMASTER GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES . <p> " I have this vision , " says Tony Frank , with his characteristic grin , " of mariners , navigators , and cartographers sailing up the Gulf of California , and just sailing and sailing against the prevailing winds , and the crew muttering , ' This damn thing is an island , ' and the captain saying , ' Yeah , might be , and we 're gon na be in this channel forever at this rate . What the hell , no one will know , anyway . ' " <p> Frank laughs . " That 's the part I always liked : ' Hey , put down that this is an island . No one will know , anyway . ' " <p> His maps all depict California sliding off the North American land mass like an amoeba . It 's funny how similar they all are . Frank points out that whether the agenda was to chart the unknown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stake a territorial claim , the early cartographers were a decidedly collegial bunch : they all copied each other . <p> " For 200 years , cartographers  --  who were avowed plagiarists  --  copied each other 's maps and perpetuated this idea until 1720 , " he says . " We 're talking like , yesterday . Most maps of the West Coast showed California as an island not because the makers believed it was , but because the previous map showed it that way . " <p> His fascination heightened after learning about Father Kino , a wandering missionary priest . " He was a Mexican padre who helped Christianize lower and middle California , and I think his was the first concept that California was an island . " ( Padre Kino may have been onto something there . ) <p> Frank , 59 , who began collecting maps ten years ago , revels in cartographical inaccuracies . Maps of the New World represented a kind of codified speculation . <p> " When they did n't know what was there , they inserted their cartouche ( the scroll-like tablet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details ) . It was really a filler . That was their way of finessing the whole thing , " he says . <p> " To me it 's almost an historic joke . Certain things they knew flawlessly , certain things they were a bit confused on , such as the Great Lakes . " The lakes are shown as misshapen , boxy bodies of water lying tenuously in the middle of the great , semi-discovered continent . He relishes the inventiveness of their makers . <p> " Lakes that never existed , Apaches in the Plains regions  --  what they knew and did n't know becomes more interesting as I study them . " He lingers on the combination of near-perfect mapping with pure hokum : " Hispaniola and Cuba were correct , but then over here , nothing . And these islands , they do n't even exist , " he says , finger tapping a section of the South Atlantic . <p> But his favorite anomaly is the hot dog floating off the coast of Nevada . " New Albion , " he says , " where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be Marin County . Then there are the ' inland islands ' in the channel separating California from the mainland . Actually , it 's amazing how accurate they were , in a way . Everyone has had the experience of being in a boat in the ocean . What if someone told you to draw a map of the shoreline from there ? " <p> The current state of the map market also suits a practical man like Frank . " Considering that the actual pieces of paper are hundreds of years old , maps are still relatively affordable . These cost about a thousand dollars . Nothing like the art market . " The British magazine , The Map Collector ( 48 High Street , Tring , Hertfordshire , H 5BH , England ) , caters to what appears to be a globally expanding taste . <p> His odd collection begs the question , why would the man who ran First Nationwide Bank , one of the nation 's most profitable savings and loans ( one is tempted to say , only ) , want to take on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do some public service , " he explains , " and I wanted to do it in a nonpartisan job , because I do n't think you get anything done in a partisan job in Washington . If you are a professional anything , you want to go to the top of your profession , and I am a professional manager . I think running the Postal Service is the biggest , management challenge in the United States . " <p> When he arrived , Frank was the fifth Postmaster General in five years . He recently cleared the two-and-a-half-year mark , something of a modern record . Frank has other reasons for accepting the job . He emigrated to the U.S. in 1937 , a year after his parents , who were fleeing the persecutions in Nazi Germany . " I remember people crying in the visa office , " he says . " It makes an enormous impression on a five-year-old . I remember asking , ' Why are those people crying ? ' And my parents told me , ' Because they ca n't get out . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change the corporate culture of a 215-year old institution . When he took over the Postal Service , he says , " There was such a disincentive for risk that people were reluctant to stick their heads above the trench . " Things are loosening up now , according to Frank , who is on the road a few days each week , visiting post offices and talking to the carriers who make the appointed rounds . <p> You get the sense he actually loves the job , even as he talks about its strange pressures : the pretzel lobby demanding beer-flavored glue , for example , for the back of a stamp honoring its 300th anniversary ; or the Secretary of State calling up to emphasize the global importance of a stamp honoring the 30th anniversary of the Antarctic Treaty . <p> Or coping with the dinosaur stamp scandal . When the P.O. issued a stamp in 1989 identifying the Brontosaurus by its popular name instead of as an Apatosaurus , its unrecognizable scientific name , there was an uproar . Even The New York Times got into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misidentifying the Mesozoic reptile . A staffer at the American Museum of Natural History in New York finally spoke up and said we call it a Brontosaurus , too , and we say to hell with it . <p> The humor of it all was not lost on Father Kino 's admirer . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By Leslie C.
