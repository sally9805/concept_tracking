<p> April 2 , Friday , 10:36 p.m. : <p> " " Backed close to the Trinity River on the southern edge of downtown Dallas is a hulking , white relic of the 1940s called " " The Sportatorium . " The marquee lacks a few letters , but tonight 's message is clear : " " Kevin Von Erich and Gentleman Chris Adams vs . <p> The Fabulous Freebirds . " <p> " " Just now a blast of rock music rattles the rusting skeleton of the old building . A few thousand feet shuffle on well-worn floorboards . Beer sloshes from Styrofoam cups and heads bob as the crowd jostles for better position . " " " It 's time to wrestle . " <p> " " The drumbeat 's steady and visceral , strong and amplified . <p> It vibrates the girders of the balcony and rocks out into the night to echo off the walls of the cinder-block liquor stores along the seedy side of Industrial Boulevard . " <p> " " It booms inside the Sportatorium . The spotlight swings down the aisle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ring . There 's a snarl from the crowd . Barnes mugs for the audience . <p> Hayes climbs the ropes and does a taunting bump and grind to the drumbeat , shedding his sequined fringe jacket as his pectorals jump and his blond hair swirls around his shoulders . " <p> " " Then it 's a fast roll on the snare drum and there 's Kevin Von Erich . Kevin sprints barefoot toward the ring , vaults from the floor and somersaults over the ropes . Chris Adams follows and jumps to Kevin 's side . " <p> " " And watching from their corner is the legend , the man many in this crowd came to see . A man who has n't been in this arena in six years . Grayed and bent but still powerful , The German Bomber . <p> . . Fritz Von Erich . . . the man with the Iron Claw . <p> A decade ago they were the brightest lights on the carnival stage of pro wrestling . The Von Erichs , five young brothers , the sons of Fritz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One by natural causes , three by suicide until , today , only one remains . Drugs and disillusionment played a part in some cases , accident and injury in others . <p> Wrestling played a part in all . <p> Six sons were born to Jack and Doris Adkisson . Jackie , the first , died as a child in a freak incident in Niagara Falls , N.Y. , in 1959 . The others grew to manhood and , one by one , followed their father into the wrestling arena . <p> The Von Erichs were white knights in a smoke-and-mirrors world where the good are pure of heart and villains are bad to the bone . Professional wrestling is a morality play , but the shtick is demanding and the Von Erichs met the requirements . Tall , trim , powerful young men , they were fundamentally religious , thoroughly sportsmanlike and utterly American . <p> There was David , the " " Yellow Rose of Texas , " 6 feet 7 , red-haired and freckled with a signature cowboy hat and a grin ; Kevin , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " " The Texas Tornado , " with his huge , sculpted muscles ; Mike , who lived through near-fatal toxic shock syndrome to return to the ring ; and Chris , who overcame a lifetime of asthma and stunted growth to join his brothers . <p> When they lost , it was because of the despicable , underhanded tactics of their opponents . When they won  --  and , eventually , they always won  --  it was through courage and perseverance . <p> They were the products of television , innovation and ingenuity . Years before Hulk Hogan 's image graced school lunch boxes , there was World Class Championship Wrestling with the Von Erichs at its core . The Von Erichs , managed by their father , began the technique of taping matches with multiple cameras , blending in rock music and producing wrestling videos . They were seen in 129 television markets . They had the most popular television show in Israel . They were loved in Japan and Africa and so idolized around their hometown of Dallas that they sometimes resorted to disguises to avoid crowds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David , 25 , found dead with an intestinal inflammation during a wrestling tour in Japan in 1984 ; then Mike , 23 , who took an overdose of tranquilizers and rolled up in a sleeping bag by the shore of Lake Dallas in 1987 ; Chris , 21 , who walked to a favorite spot on his parents ' East Texas ranch and shot himself in the head in 1991 . <p> Finally , Kerry , 33 , after a drug conviction and a divorce , scribbled his requiem on a tablecloth , drove to his father 's ranch near Dallas and shot himself in the heart on Feb. 18 this year . <p> One by one they joined their brother Jackie . Of the brothers , only Kevin remains . Of the Von Erich wrestling empire , there are only videotapes and a memory <p> 10:41 p.m. : <p> " " Kevin and Hayes grapple in the ring as Freebird Barnes  - -  stealthily , illegally  --  slips through the ropes . Just as Kevin hurls Hayes to the floor in a full body slam , Barnes strikes a vicious blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kevin is stunned . He staggers . He gapes in disbelief at the ignoble behavior , then flushes with indignation . He leaps into the air , kicks powerfully with both bare feet and knocks Barnes through the ropes and out of the ring . " <p> " " Barnes crashes violently into a row of metal chairs . He has fallen at the feet of General Skandar Akbar , a swarthy wrestler in a beret and military clothing , strutting threateningly around the ring . " <p> The Iron Claw , the massive right hand that could crimp silver dollars , cupped a cigarette gingerly , and Jack Adkisson sat forward in the kitchen chair . He watched the remnants of an overnight rain drip past the window , and he considered his life . <p> Adkisson , 63 , is famous in his field . He 's wealthy and still a bull of a man except for ruined knees that are creaking mementos of 33 years of athletic punishment . He also is a year into a divorce from the wife to whom he was married for 42 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles from the home he built for his family . <p> He has lost five sons . <p> He exhaled the smoke with a sigh and spoke in the foghorn voice that cowed spectators for years . <p> " " People ask how you live through a loss like this . I do n't know how . You just . . . do it . <p> " " I do n't know that I have any answers . Suicide has so many causes . You ca n't say it 's any one thing . " " Some people say I pushed those boys into wrestling and wrestling killed them , like I killed them . <p> " " Killed them ? I loved those boys . I did n't force them to be wrestlers . I wanted something good for them and I 'd rather they had gone into one of the professions , but when they wanted to be wrestlers , I helped them . <p> " " But wrestling did n't kill them . Different things killed them . I do believe it 's easier for a person to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there were so many factors . <p> I know there were drugs . I know my sons had problems with drugs . I think the drugs probably went back as far as high school . I know some of them had problems with their personal lives . <p> " " Maybe they had too much too soon . The second year he was wrestling , when he was only 20 years old , Kerry made $ 200,000 . " <p> That was far more than Jack Adkisson had made at 20 . In 1950 he was fresh from Jewett , Texas , the 6-foot-4-inch , 275-pound son of a county sheriff , eking his way through Southern Methodist University in Dallas , playing football and throwing the discus on an athletic scholarship . He had set the national freshman discus record and just made the varsity team when he met Doris Smith , a young coed from Louisiana . The two were married six weeks later , a forbidden status for SMU athletes , and Adkisson promptly lost his scholarship . <p> He played professional football briefly for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future ( before television adopted the sport ) seemed bleak . Adkisson saw a better promise in pro wrestling . <p> World War II was a fresh memory and he became the most hated of villains , " " Fritz Von Erich , The German Bomber . " He created " " the Iron Claw , " in which he would grasp his opponent 's head with the huge , right hand , and squeeze until blood flowed and arms and legs flailed on the canvas . <p> Two years after they married , the Adkissons had their first son , Jack Jr . Within three more years Kevin , then David followed . <p> Adkisson was wrestling throughout the Midwest and in Canada in the 1950s , and the family was living in a trailer camp near Niagara Falls in 1959 when Jackie was killed . <p> " " Some fellow had been hooking his trailer to a power line and it made the outer skin of the whole trailer hot , " said Adkisson . " " Jackie was standing in a puddle of melting snow when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the puddle and drowned . <p> " " I was out on the road when it happened . Nothing had ever hit me like that . It hurt worse than anything that had ever happened to me . I blamed myself . If I 'd been home , not out on the road , maybe it would n't have happened . It made me mean . I was angry . I wanted to die . <p> " " Then David and Kevin became more precious and , when Kerry came along 11 months later , he was special . He was really special . " <p> 10:47 p.m. : <p> " " His name is George and he 's here with his niece and his brother-in-law and he has n't been in the Sportatorium in 20 years . <p> He 's listing a little , swaying slightly on the bench and grinning at the action in the ring . He 's had nine beers at $ 2 each and says they 're too expensive . " <p> " " This is all fake , man . I know , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the ring , the one who got kicked in the head ? You see him get up and get back in there ? Man , you do n't get up when you been hit in the head like that . <p> " " I been hit in the head by the police , man . I know . " <p> In 1960 the Adkissons returned to Dallas . " " Fritz Von Erich " and " " The Iron Claw " were copyrighted names . Fans loved hating the Prussian villain so much they had started to like him . Television had picked up wrestling , and he was making money . He was managing other wrestlers and eventually leased the Sportatorium and formed World Class Championship Wrestling . He also started investing in land in the metroplex between Dallas and Fort Worth and moved his family to a 150-acre ranch north of town . <p> There his sons had what Adkisson believed was an idyllic life . The family raised quail , cattle , horses and Black Labrador retrievers . The boys rode dirt bikes , fished in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and trained in their own private gym . <p> They attended Lake Dallas High School , where first Kevin , then David , then Kerry graduated with athletic honors , if not great academic achievement . Kevin and David went on to North Texas State University in Denton , where they played football . Kerry , a discus thrower with hands as large as his father 's , went to the University of Houston . He broke a junior world discus record there and was a prospect for the Olympics , but President Jimmy Carter 's boycott of the 1980 games ended those hopes . <p> Then the Von Erich brothers dropped out of college and joined World Class wrestling . The Sportatorium became their personal stage , and World Class began to grow . <p> " " It was phenomenal , " said Bill Mercer . Mercer , the former voice of the Dallas Cowboys and a network sportscaster , had been an announcer for studio wrestling since the early 1960s . Today , he teaches at NTSU , but the mellifluous voice has n't changed since he was announcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was a combination of the right people with the right idea at the right time , " said Mercer . " " Fritz was working with some guys at Channel 39 and they came along with the multiple cameras and choreography and World Class just mushroomed overnight . <p> " " David really had the best shtick of all the boys . He 'd gone out on his own , wrestled down in Florida as a bad guy and learned all the ropes . He had a persona with the cowboy hat and the boots , and he had ridden horses and worked cattle enough to make it legitimate . <p> " " Kevin was acrobatic , but he did n't have much to say , and Kerry was just like a huge teen-ager . His muscles were so big he was intimidating , but he did n't come across that way . <p> " " You 'd tell him , " Kerry , when we get on camera we want you to say this and this and this and this . ' He 'd get by ringside and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " OK , I 'm supposed to say this and this and this and . .. what else ? ' " <p> Remembering lines was of little importance , however . Kerry Von Erich stood 6 feet 4 , with flowing , blond hair and 290 pounds packed into corded arms and shoulders . Teen-age girls screamed when he trotted to the ring , and he was considered the most popular of the Von Erichs . <p> " " Things were really great then , " said David Manning , a former referee with World Class . <p> " " I was bringing home $ 125,000 a year , and that was something for a wrestling referee . I think I had five cars , and Kerry had the same number . Kevin and Kerry and I all bought $ 300,000 houses at the same time . <p> " " Of course , eventually we all lost them about the same time , too . " <p> There were the usual dues of stardom . The sight of a Von Erich drew a crowd . Kevin retreated with his family , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasses and a burnoose to Christmas-shop for his wife and daughters in downtown Dallas . <p> Those wives and families were secrets . All three of the older brothers were married by the time their fame grew , but they had to appear available and they wore their wedding rings only in private . <p> There also was religion . Piety was a large part of World Class . Adkisson had undergone a religious conversion in the mid-1970s and begun attending W.A.Criswell 's 2,700-seat First Baptist Church in Dallas . He appeared on " " The 700 Club , " as did his sons , and World Class even had its own chaplain . <p> Finally , riding the coattail of money , there were drugs . <p> " " Gorgeous " Gino Hernandez , a World Class Championship wrestler , overdosed on so much cocaine in 1986 that there was speculation he had been murdered and his death was ruled of " " undetermined " causes . There were rumors of other drug-related incidents , and the athlete 's helper , steroids , were in abundance . <p> Anabolic steroids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Sure , Kerry used steroids , " said Adkisson . " " I can remember when he ran out of them while he was down in Houston , and he called me to get him more . Back then we did n't know that much about them or long-term effects . <p> " " I do n't know if the other boys used them , but I do n't think they did , except for Chris , and the prednisone he 'd been taking for years for asthma was a steroid base . " <p> Little documentation has been done on steroid use by athletes , largely because , as one wrestling promoter said , " " They all lie about it . <p> " " They 're either taking twice as much as they tell you and they claim all the muscles came from the gym , or they 're taking half as much and they lie to you to impress you with that . " <p> A 1989 study by Herbert D. Kleber , a Columbia University psychiatrist , and Kenneth B.Kashkin , M.D. , showed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from cocaine , including loss of energy , lowered sex drive , malaise and even suicidal thoughts . <p> Most steroid users do not commit suicide , however , and the Von Erich brothers ' troubles ran deeper than body-building drugs . <p> 10:55 p.m. : <p> " " All four wrestlers are in the ring now . Kevin wheels and grabs Hayes in a headlock with his right arm . Barnes comes from behind , but Kevin is wary . At the last second , he snakes the left arm around Barnes ' neck and begins banging both Freebird heads together fiercely . " " " A rhythmic stomp has started , and the crowd is chanting , " " Go , Kevin , Go . " Kevin rams the heads together for a final , skull-splitting crash and drops their wobbling bodies to the canvas . " " " George is on his feet now . He 's still holding his $ 2 beer , and he 's stomping his right foot and chanting . " <p> David Von Erich 's death shocked those who knew him . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tokyo on a wrestling tour in February 1984 when he was late for a match . David was never late , so wrestler " " Bruiser " Frank Brody and a few others went to David 's hotel where they found him dead on the floor of his room . <p> Rumors spread that Brody had found drugs in the room and flushed them down the toilet , but Brody , who was stabbed to death a few years later in a fight with another wrestler in Puerto Rico , denied those stories . <p> " " David was pretty sick with the flu before he left , " said Manning . " " But Fritz always had a thing about never failing to show up for a match and he instilled it in David , so he went anyway . " <p> Adkisson arranged for an autopsy at a U.S. military base in Tokyo before the body was returned . The cause of death was listed as " " acute enteritis . " <p> Thousands of fans packed the church in Lake Dallas . The procession strung for miles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burial . There were testimonials to David Von Erich , and his brothers made vows to " " uphold the David Von Erich tradition . " Adkisson noted that " " if there 's a wrestling ring up there , I know ol ' David is a main eventer . I 'm sure he 's a champion . " <p> " " The religion was so thick you could cut it , " said Mercer . <p> " " It was strange . I mean , David was a nice guy , and it was a tragedy he died so young . It was OK to talk about tradition , but what tradition ? This is " wrestling . " ' <p> Two months later , on May 6 , 1984 , Kerry donned a jacket that read " " In Memory of David , " stepped onto a mat in Dallas ' Texas Stadium in front of 43,000 spectators and won the World Federation wrestling title . Mike , 20 , joined his brothers as the third wrestling Von Erich . <p> Cracks were already spreading in World Class Championship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they had n't reached the surface . The Von Erichs continued to make money , and Kerry was spending his as fast as he made it . Adkisson and his wife were building a huge , colonial home in Edom , near Tyler . <p> Mike Adkisson was not as large or muscular as his older brothers . Still , he rarely lost a match . He was winning one in Israel in the spring 1985 when he dislocated a shoulder and underwent surgery . After the surgery , he contracted toxic shock syndrome . His temperature rose to 107 degrees and remained high for hours . He was placed on kidney dialysis and a respirator . He was not expected to live , but he did . <p> " " But he never fully recovered , " said Adkisson . " " Not physically or mentally . He was never the same Mike again . " <p> That did n't prevent him from making television appearances and promising a comeback . When he was wheeled from the Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas , he smiled weakly and promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Cotton Bowl . " <p> A few months later , a television crew made a documentary on his recovery and were unable to piece together a coherent interview with him in four hours . Inside the ring , his performance was lackluster . Outside , it was erratic . He fought with his father , and he was arrested in Fort Worth for kicking in a car door during an altercation at a stoplight . <p> He was using drugs , primarily the tranquilizer , Placidyl . <p> Unknown to his parents or brothers , he was visiting two doctors and getting prescriptions from both . <p> On Saturday , April 12 , 1987 , Mike was arrested for driving under the influence of drugs near his parents ' ranch . He was released on bond the next morning , but failed to appear at a wrestling match in Dallas that night . <p> His family reported him missing on Monday and , on Thursday , April 17 , 1987 , he was found wrapped in a sleeping bag near Lake Dallas , dead from an overdose of Placidyl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself as a " "  --  up " and left his scuba gear to his younger brother , Chris . <p> Once again there was a packed church and thousands of mourners , one of them Kerry , who issued a message : " " I am so glad that Mike is with David now . Mike never really liked to be alone . " <p> Kerry Von Erich was having his own problems . He was about to lose his right foot . The ankle had been severely injured when Kerry struck a car while riding a motorcycle on June 4 , 1986 . <p> The joint was fractured and several attempts were made to bond the bones , but amputation became necessary a year later . Like his wedding ring , Kerry Von Erich kept his prosthetic foot a secret . He continued to wrestle , in pain , on Novocain and with a limp . He appeared for matches already dressed , showered with his boots on and hobbled to his car with water running through the lace-holes . <p> " " He wanted to win a world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Adkisson . " " It would have been a great thing for people with prosthetic limbs . " <p> At the same time , World Class was beginning to crumble . <p> Adkisson had soured on the business after Mike 's death and turned the Sportatorium over to Kevin . Two years later Kerry and Kevin joined with Jerry Jarrett , a wrestling promoter from Hendersonville , Tenn. , but the partnership was not a happy one and ended with the brothers suing Jarrett . <p> In that suit , which was eventually dropped , Kevin contended that Jarrett milked World Class , took over the Sportatorium and began excluding him and Kerry from performances . Jarrett gives an opposite account : that World Class was in financial chaos when he got it , that he lost money in the arrangement and that he stopped booking Kevin and Kerry " " because they started missing their bookings . When they did show up , they were not in a physical or mental condition to wrestle . " <p> Jarrett was managing World Class Championship Wrestling in 1990 when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a business of giants , Chris Von Erich stood 5 feet , 5 inches tall . He had suffered chronic asthma all his life . He had built muscles by rigid , prolonged weight-lifting , but his bones were brittle and the asthma still plagued him when he stepped into the World Class ring . <p> He was determined to wrestle , however , and he once told Jarrett , " " You really ought to push me more . " <p> " " I told him , " Chris , you 're just on the small side , ' " said Jarrett , " " and he answered , " But I 'm a Von Erich . ' " <p> Chris ' career was brief . He broke an elbow in a match in Dallas in 1991 . He moved to his parents ' home in Edom to recuperate , but the bone would not mend , and it was apparent he would never be a successful wrestler . <p> His parents were sitting at the kitchen table on the evening of Sept. 11 , 1991 , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Chris ' room . <p> " " I read that note and it did n't mention suicide , but I knew there was something wrong , " said Adkisson .

' " <p> Kevin Adkisson found his brother near a mound of Indian relics that Chris and Mike had gathered years before . He had shot himself in the head with a 9 mm pistol . An autopsy showed traces of cocaine and Benzodiazepine ( Valium ) in his system . <p> " " I 've never believed he meant to commit suicide , " said Adkisson . " " The angle of the bullet was strange , sort of from the back . I 've always thought he was toying with the idea and fired the gun accidentally , but we 'll never know .

Hayes ' flailing grows weaker and , as his arms drop to the mat , Kevin spryly jumps on Barnes and applies the hold again . " <p> " " An agitated Skandar Akbar moves closer to the ring . " <p> By 1991 , life had soured for Kerry Von Erich . His matches were fewer , and the days when he could pack Texas Stadium were past . Cathy , his wife of 10 years , had just divorced him . He was struggling with $ 2,500 per month child support for his two girls , Hollie , 8 , and Lacey , 6 <p> He also had a cocaine habit he could not shake . He had used drugs before , been arrested with an assortment of prescription pills at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport shortly after his wedding , but that case was dropped . His use had escalated after losing his foot . <p> On Feb. 9 , 1992 , he was arrested in Richardson , near Dallas , with six forged prescriptions for the pain reliever Vicodin and Valium . He checked into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 10-year probation . <p> The white knight had a drug conviction . He had lost more than a foot : His house , his wife , his children and his image were gone . <p> The man who once had five cars had to borrow one from his father , and his mother bought him a house in the East Texas town of Jefferson . <p> His closest confidant at the time appears to have been his lawyer , Charles Caperton of Dallas . Caperton arranged for Kerry 's drug treatment , defended him on the charges and now serves as trustee of a fund for his children . <p> " " He was n't just a client , he was like a son to me , " said Caperton . " " He was like a big , 14-year-old boy . He had a big heart , and there was nothing mean about him . The last few years of his life I 'll bet he did 90 percent of his appearances for one benefit or another and did n't get paid for them . Children loved him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' homes just to make them happy , not for any fees . <p> " " He had a lot of good in him . He just could n't handle reality . " <p> On Jan.13 , four months after receiving probation , Kerry was arrested again in Irving with a syringe and cocaine under the seat of the car he was driving . Caperton thought he could win the case . <p> The car was a loaner from a Dallas garage , and Kerry had only been driving it a short time . The drugs in the car might not have been his . The hearing on violation of his probation was scheduled for Feb. 18 . <p> That morning Kerry called Kevin and told him he was planning to commit suicide but would not do it immediately . Kevin attempted to call Adkisson , but could not reach him . Kerry called Caperton 's office three times , but the lawyer was in trial . He then met his ex-wife for lunch in Dallas .

" <p> About 1:30 p.m. , Kerry arrived at his father 's farmhouse with Elaine Barrett , a friend who sometimes kept Kerry 's daughters . <p> Adkisson was pouring concrete for a sidewalk and , while he spoke to Barrett , Kerry apparently slipped inside and took a .44-caliber revolver he had given his father for Christmas some years before . <p> He was obviously depressed , and he hugged his father tightly when he saw him . <p> " " I really love you , Dad , " he said . " " I just want to go out and drive for a while . I need to be alone , to think about some things . " <p> " " That was n't so strange in itself , " said Adkisson .

There was one glove lying on the seat , and I knew there was something wrong . <p> I kept calling for him and driving back and forth ; then , finally , I went back and started walking from the Jeep . <p> " " I found him lying there in a patch of mesquite .
