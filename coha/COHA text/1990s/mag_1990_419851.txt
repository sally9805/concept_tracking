<p> At Washington National Cathedral , after 83 years of work , plans are set to celebrate its completion  --  a triumph of faith and reason <p> A light rain pattered on the 10,000 people who had crowded onto Mount St. Alban , one of the highest hills in the nation 's capital , on September 29 , 1907 . They were there to applaud Bishop Henry Yates Satterlee as he began construction of the Cathedral Church of St. Peter and St. Paul , known as Washington National Cathedral , by striking the foundation stone with an ivory-and-gold mallet once used by George Washington . <p> They had come for the festivities on foot and in horse-drawn carriages , commercial wagons , new luxury automobiles and the electric trolleys that hummed along Wisconsin Avenue in those days . A few umbrellas sprouted over the heads of the crowd , but most onlookers preferred to brave the rain . President Theodore Roosevelt , accompanied by his wife and two of their children , arrived just before the noon ceremony by carriage from the White House , three miles away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Episcopal bishop and his followers " Godspeed in the work begun this noon . " Great cathedrals have taken many decades , even centuries , to complete , and no one expected this one to go up with dispatch . Bishop Satterlee warned the onlookers , " Nobody here will live to see the completion of this cathedral . " <p> But the good bishop was mistaken . Exactly 83 years later , on September 29 of this year , at least a half-dozen of the children in that historic first crowd will occupy seats of honor as the final stone is placed on top of Washington National Cathedral , which looks loftily down on the busy hub of government a few miles away in central Washington . The setting of that piece will mark the last act in the drama of a monumental church built in the medieval manner  --  the sixth-largest cathedral in area in the world , with a nave that climbs almost as high as that of Notre Dame in Paris . <p> There have been moments when many people believed not only that the good bishop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed . Soon after the Bicentennial of the American Revolution , in fact , all construction stopped for lack of funds . The project was in so much debt that it seemed fool-hardy to talk about anything except paying off creditors . " I 'm one of those who thought then that it would never get finished , " admits Canon Richard T. Feller , who as Clerk of the Works has supervised construction of the cathedral for 37 years . If construction were delayed even as little as five years , Canon Feller believed , the few stonemasons and carvers , members of a highly skilled and dwindling craft , would leave Washington for other projects throughout the world and find it difficult to move back . But a tireless campaign amassed enough funds by 19S0 to resume construction . The masons and carvers were recalled , and Feller now plans to retire on September 30 , the day after the grand ceremony . Envisioned : " a great church for national purposes " <p> Although the cathedral is only now near completion , it has functioned as a church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crypt level . Church officials like to boast that their cathedral fulfills the vision set down by Pierre L'Enfant , the French architect who designed the city of Washington and included " a great church for national purposes " in his plans . But no church , of course , has such standing under the American constitutional separation of church and state . Washington Cathedral receives no federal money and plays no official role in government . Yet it is surely one of the best-known churches in the country . President Woodrow Wilson is buried there ; so are author Helen Keller and wartime Secretary of State Cordell Hull . Funeral services for President Dwight D. Eisenhower and the Inaugural prayers for both Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush were offered there . Martin Luther King jr . preached his last Sunday sermon in the cathedral a few days before his assassination . <p> In a sense , there is something anachronistic about the completion of this Gothic cathedral near the turn of the 21st century . Gothic is a style developed in the Middle Ages , revived in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century . For years , critics would belittle the architecture of the cathedral as a dead end , a waste of time and money , and urge the bishops and deans to abandon the Gothic for a more modern style . " Gothic became so out of style that it was ridiculed , " says Canon Feller . But the builders clung stubbornly to their vision and finally saw acceptance of the style once again . <p> Washington National Cathedral is a great edifice of towers , flying buttresses and gargoyles outside , and awesome columns , enormous ribs and high vaulting inside . The entire massive structure , like medieval cathedrals of old , is built of stone  --  in this case , Indiana limestone  --  without any steel to hold it up . Its main tower , crowded with bells , reaches so high  --  300 feet  --  that a lucky visitor can see the great skyline of Washington and what were once Civil War campgrounds in Maryland and Virginia . On sunlit days , light streaming in through intricate stained-glass windows dapples the walls and columns and bays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far more than their masonry and art . They comprise many worlds . This was driven home to me on two brief occasions earlier this year . On a chilling , wintry night , hundreds of music lovers filled the pews of the nave and transepts , which meet at the crossing in front of the choir . They listened to players of the recorder , the lute , the psaltery and other medieval instruments , along with a quartet of singers , perform religious music of the 12th and 13th centuries in a celebration of the " splendor of the Gothic cathedral . " A cathedral is not an ideal concert hall . This one is so enormous that the musicians and singers seemed far off in the distance . Some of the listeners may have been having trouble with the music , for medieval music is subtle , elusive and , to a few , perhaps boring . Yet the moments at this concert were charged with awe . My gaze was pulled away from the distant performers by the massive columns and ribbing that soared ever upward to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The music lofted gently upward with the curve and climb of the ribbing . The sense of majesty and mystery offered a glimpse of how a medieval worshiper once experienced the Gothic cathedral . <p> My second insight came on a gray morning a couple of days later  --  Martin Luther King 's birthday . The canons of the cathedral began a weeklong vigil , " Prayer Over Washington , " against the scourge of drugs . A few people , some kneeling , listened to an Episcopal priest in a white cassock lead prayers in the Bethlehem Chapel . " May those whose health and freedom have been lost to addiction find strength and support to overcome their weakness , " the priest intoned . Washington , the nation 's capital , is riven with crime and drugs and poverty . Despite the medieval mood of the architecture and stained-glass windows , a visitor to the crypt chapel now came face-to-face with a shame and terror of the late 20th century . <p> When a group of prominent Episcopal laymen received a charter from Congress in 1893 to form a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it should look like . At first , they favored a classic Renaissance style . By 1906 , this design still had an important advocate in Daniel H. Burnham of Chicago , one of the most-prominent architects in the United States . But the majority agreed with Bishop Satterlee that only the Gothic style would fit their idea of a cathedral . The foundation then hired George Frederick Bodley , the most-renowned Gothic-style architect of Britain , and English-born Henry Vaughan of Boston to design a cathedral resembling some of the best-known Gothic churches in England . <p> The modern architect Le Corbusier once called medieval cathedrals " acts of optimism , " and it is true that Gothic cathedrals came out of an optimistic era when rich burghers from prosperous towns in France decided to subsidize great religious works . For the glory of God , they wanted enormous buildings that soared to Hand-carved ornate bosses lock together the ribbed vaulting ; the cathedral has more than 600 of them . dizzying heights and glowed inside with the light of the sun . The flying buttress  --  an architectural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both . Instead of the walls of the cathedral supporting the vaulted ceilings above the floor of the nave , graceful stone arches carried the thrust of the vaulting to solid structures of masonry outside . With these buttresses supporting the height of the cathedral , the walls could be opened for stained-glass windows that admitted an incredible play of filtered sunlight inside . A widespread disdain for the Gothic <p> During the Renaissance , critics disparaged these cathedrals and came up with the term " Gothic " to describe them . They proclaimed that the art of the Middle Ages was so monstrous that it surely must have been created by the Goths ; in short , by barbarians . This disdain lasted until the 19th century , when people became enamored with the height , light and sculpted decoration of the Gothic style . <p> Three men  --  architect Philip Hubert Frohman , who enhanced the Gothic mood while modifying the designs ; Dean Francis B. Sayre jr. , who powered the longest continual stretch of construction ; and Bishop John T. Walker , who led the church into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more responsible than any others for the image that people have of the majestic cathedral on the eve of its completion . <p> Frohman was a 27-year-old California architect when he first visited the Bethlehem Chapel in 1914 . He was so awed by it that he came back several times . He even wrote a wish into the visitors book-in private code  --  that he might someday serve as architect of the future cathedral . Cathedral officials , in fact , would soon be looking for a new architect . Bodley had died in 1907 , and Vaughan died in 1917 . <p> In 1921 , Frohman 's secret wish was fulfilled when his firm was hired to take over as architects of the cathedral ; Frohman worked as the cathedral 's main architect until he retired 50 years later . His contribution was crucial . He made important modifications in the original Bodley and Vaughan designs for the west front , enlarging the large rose window . Even more crucial , he made the cathedral soar upward in the French manner . In the end , although the cathedral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as Bodley and Vaughan had planned , it would include French elements that added grace and beauty . <p> In the view of Canon Feller , Frohman , much like the deeply religious architects of medieval times , had the uncanny ability to feel the full Gothic unity of his cathedral as he worked . Feller recalls Frohman coming into his office one day in the late 1950s when the Clerk of the Works was young and new . " Mr. Feller , " the architect said sternly , " I understand you to have said that I was an anachronism . Would you please explain that to me ? " <p> The agitation of the great architect shocked Feller . He tried to explain . " Mr. Frohman , you understand and feel clearly the true Gothic style . I think of your work as Frohman Gothic . You are not copying from a textbook . You had no one to teach you . But you had it in you . That is what I mean by calling you an anachronism . " The architect calmed down , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . <p> A young priest , Francis B. Sayre jr. , born in the White House when his grandfather Woodrow Wilson was President , was named dean  --  the chief clergyman and administrator  --  of the cathedral in 1951 . Construction of the building had been slowed during the Great Depression and was halted from 1942 to 1948 . When Dean Sayre took over , his cathedral was made up of only the apse ( the polygonal end that includes the high altar and the reredos space behind it ) , the choir , the columns of the crossing , and the north transept . Since this cathedral , like most , had been designed in the shape of a cross , the new dean 's church could be described as possessing the top and one arm of the cross but not the other arm or the main bar  --  the nave . And it still had none of its three towers . <p> Dean Sayre proved himself a tireless builder and an influential presence in Washington , often in the news , often speaking out on public issues . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cathedral as provost , describes Sayre as " brilliant , poetic , patrician . . . one who often took stands on things that were not popular , " pointing out that the dean was one of the first to work on behalf of the Palestinians . Under Dean Sayre , the central tower with its pealing bells and carillon went up over the crossing , the 218-foot-long nave was extended and finished , and the west facade of the main entrance was started . By the time of the Bicentennial celebrations in 1976 , all but the west facade and the two west towers had been completed . <p> But the rush of construction in time for the Bicentennial had left the cathedral with a crushing debt of $10.7 million . Although Dean Sayre still wanted to forge ahead , Bishop William F. Creighton decided that the financial plight had grown too precarious . As Canon Feller has written , at a meeting of the Chapter ( the cathedral 's governing board ) in December 1976 , " the cold winds turned into a gale and . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his good friend and colleague , the dean . " Bishop Creighton took control of the financing and , after a year , called for an indefinite halt to construction . <p> Witnesses insist that decorum ruled the meeting . " Christian gentlemen do not scream at each other , " says Canon Feller . But there was no doubt , as Provost Perry puts it , that this was a " tender period " for church leadership . When Sayre retired in 1978 , six months after Bishop Creighton 's retirement , prospects for finishing the cathedral looked bleakest . Sayre , who now lives on Martha 's Vineyard , will return to the cathedral this September to help celebrate its completion . <p> In 1977 , John T. Walker , at 52 , succeeded William F. Creighton as Episcopal Bishop of Washington . As a black clergyman in a church long identified with the white establishment of America , Bishop Walker , born in Georgia and brought up in Detroit , was used to breaking racial precedents . He was the first black graduate of Virginia Theological Seminary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's School in New Hampshire , and the first black Episcopal Bishop of Washington . To avoid any hint of conflict between he diocese and the cathedral , Bishop Walker decided serve as the new dean of the cathedral . <p> As he wrote later , Bishop Walker felt both " depressed and concerned " as he took over . " I was depressed that cathedral debt and construction efforts would dominate my episcopate and take me away from he main thrust of my ministry to the diocese , " he said . At the same time I was concerned that if construction Lid not resume in a short time , the momentum would be lost and we might never again be in a position to complete the building . " <p> But Bishop Walker also believed that the cathedral had " to reach beyond our immediate community into he city itself where there are homeless people , abused women and children , teenage alcoholics , drug addicts , murderers and rapists . " If it did not , the bishop insisted , the cathedral could become " an anachronism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the capital city . " <p> Powered by this philosophy , he decided to move on both fronts  --  to raise funds to pay off the debt and continue construction of the cathedral to the roofline , which included an observation gallery , and to raise funds for a host of programs that would send the cathedral and its staff into the community . <p> Bishop Walker succeeded in an outstanding way . In 1983 , with the debt nearly retired , the cathedral 's Chapter decided to go ahead with construction on a pay-as-you-go basis and to include the two west towers that now complete the building . Provost Perry was given responsibility for raising funds and for administering the construction . The bishop then mounted a many-sided program that insured the cathedral a significant role in the life of the city . He attracted a large number of black priests and women priests to the diocese , became a tireless spokesman on the problems of poverty and the need for understanding for the victims of AIDS in the Washington community , and often took part in antiapartheid protests at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his friends , President Bush , for what he felt was a misleading Presidential election campaign in 1988 . Through the work of the diocesan Commission on Peace and a committed staff , and many personal missions as well , the bishop also opened the cathedral to worldwide concerns far beyond the Washington community . A different kind of message <p> Bishop Walker died at the age of 64 after heart surgery last September 30 , just as cathedral officials were welcoming the final year of construction of the cathedral . The funeral services for him a week later drew 4,000 mourners , including President Bush , Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa and 46 bishops . In a tribute that probably would have touched and satisfied Bishop Walker most , a Washington Post editorial said " there was a time when a bypasser could have been forgiven for thinking that the cathedral on its hill seemed to look down on the city with the disdain of accustomed wealth and social position . Today it sends a different message , one of concern for the city and an active involvement in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkable man who was the bishop . " <p> But Bishop Walker may be remembered best for finishing the cathedral . Suffragan Bishop Ronald Haines , who is serving as Acting Bishop until elections are held and Walker 's successor is installed , says : " The completion of the cathedral is nothing short of miraculous . John Walker 's whole life seems to have been destined for his position here ; I do n't know of anyone else who could have done it . The cathedral is a monument to the cathedral has surged : last year 600,000 either visited or attended services and concerts there . It is , of course , impossible to savor all of its beauty in a brief visit . The vast cathedral reveals itself best to those who have time to know it well . <p> Only once a year , for example , are visitors permitted to see the bells of the main tower . To reach these highest chambers of the cathedral , one must unlock wrought-iron gates , slip through passageways , turn around narrow nooks , climb dizzying spiral staircases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cathedral has a carillon of 53 bells , ranging in weight from 1S pounds to 12 tons . They are controlled by an organlike instrument played by a musician . The cathedral 's change-ringing bells , the largest of which weighs 1.75 tons , sound what are known as " changes " when their ropes are pulled by ringers standing in a chamber below . The change ringing dates from Dean Sayre 's era , for he was an enthusiast of this art , once practiced in Colonial American churches and still a trademark of English cathedrals . <p> The opportunity to ring the bells attracts many different people , young and old , fascinated by the rich rhythms . On a recent Sunday , Will Ragland , a freelance writer and lecturer on architecture who once rang the bells himself , identified among the bell ringers a State Department analyst , a computer programmer , a communications expert , a Securities and Exchange Commission lawyer , and a Congressional aide . <p> When the bells first rang out in 1964 , people living in the neighborhood of the cathedral were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frazzled by the powerful clanging . The renowned journalist Walter Lippmann , a good friend of Dean Sayre 's , lived across the street and whipped himself into a fury over the decibels pounding his mind as he tried to write his column . " When the bells were ringing , " Canon Feller recalled , " it would drive him up the wall . He complained to Sayre all the time , and so did the neighborhood . " Dean Sayre soon ordered the bell tower baffled on the side facing the community , and the pealing of the bells no longer reverberates through every home in the area . <p> The cathedral has hundreds upon hundreds of stone carvings on nooks and bosses and crevices and towers and columns and recesses and spires , and it is impossible for any visitor to take in more than a few score . Even Clerk of the Works Feller probably does not know them all . Gargoyles , the monsters that served medieval cathedrals both as rainspouts and as guardians against evil , are a delight . Canon Feller once came upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stubble-bearded man with a mallet in one hand , a set of golf clubs stuck in his hip pocket , and a fierce cloud exploding from his head . The caricature seemed to resemble short-tempered master carver Roger Morigi . " Is that Roger Morigi you 're carving  --  blowing his top ? " Feller asked . " No , indeed , " the assistant replied . " I love my job here . " A hippie and a yuppie are also represented among the 105 other gargoyles . The last one , a prehistoric man clutching a club , was set in place in 1987 . <p> Aside from creating gargoyles , the sculptors and carvers have delved into their imaginations to fill the cathedral with statuettes and reliefs of a mouse , a cat , Aztecs , neighborhood dogs , and even a monkey named Eve proffering an apple . At architect Frohman 's request , sculptor Carl Bush created two versions of the same architect , one pulling his hair and scratching his head out of frustration and puzzlement , the other holding a finger in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! " <p> Since light is the essence of a Gothic church , no visitor can ignore the power of the more than 200 stained-glass windows . An enthusiastic Provost Perry showed me some of his favorites , all by Rowan LeCompte , on a recent sunlit morning . Gothic cathedrals usually have at least one rose window  --  a composition in the round with panels like petals  --  and the provost began his tour with the west front 's abstract rose window , its glass fitted with prisms that spray the cathedral with rays of color . <p> Provost Perry then pointed to the Noah window high in the nave . LeCompte depicts the evil on Earth before the Flood as a terrible violence , two soldiers slaughtering each other , and a deep pile of skulls . " This is not the usual depiction of the story of Noah , " the provost said , " but it tells us what the story of Noah is all about  --  God 's anger and hostility toward Man 's violence .

The piece was brought back by astronauts Neil Armstrong , Edwin Aldrin jr . and Michael Collins after the moon landing in 1969 . <p> Collins , a graduate of St. Albans School , which is on the cathedral grounds , and the pilot who orbited above while Armstrong and Aldrin walked on the moon , presided at that part of the service . Organ music filled the cathedral , its tones eerie , mystical .
