<p> In this feverish city of raw nerves and golden bracelets , of brash spirit and cellular phonesand deep-fried everything , it 's always Cuba si , Castro no . <p> The Cuban exile community is some 700,000 strong , and while its greatest numbers are concentrated in Little Havana , its citizens have streamed out across South Florida . The most affluent and assimilated live on fancy islands with names like Star and Bay Harbor . The working class is concentrated in conservative Hialeah , with its sweaty factories . <p> America 's melting-pot effect is muted in Florida , where signs still boast Se Habla Ingles . Everyone on the streets here is expected to understand that whatever movement has occurred between the United States and Cuba in recent weeks , it is only the beginning . The recent accord to stem the flow of illegal rafters has left most exiles decidedly unimpressed . The talks were a waste of time , they say dismissively , because nobody can reason with dictator Fidel Castro ; President Clinton 's foreign policy toward the communist island is callow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of making Cuba free . Even the Cuban American groups that worked with the administration are beginning to grow uneasy about the prospect of refugees being forced back to Cuba ; nor do they want them fenced inside Guantanamo . An invasion , many still believe , is the only answer . If it was contemplated for Haiti , why not Cuba ? <p> Now settled barely 100 miles from Havana , most of the exiles are still unarguably Cuban . Whether they flew in with elegant luggage 30 years ago or were rescued , parched and desperate , by the Coast Guard in the past few years , they eat black beans and rice , listen to Celia Cruz , play dominoes with fierce concentration . <p> But age and generation and class still work their subtle effects . South Florida 's Cubans may be united in opposition to Castro , but their views are not monolithic . Drive among the manicured lawns in Coral Gables , stroll through Miami 's Art Deco District , and the beat , although still distinctly Latin , begins to change . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , out the Tamiami Trail , is a town called Sweetwater . Before the first wave of Cuban emigres arrived here , this was horse country . But after Fidel 's revolution in 1959 , the moneyed , conservative , older generation of Cubans founded a country club on a few grassy acres near the edge of the Everglades . They called it the Big Five . <p> The name refers to the five exclusive pre-Castro Havana country clubs : The Miramar Yacht Club , the Havana Yacht Club , the Havana Biltmore Yacht and Country Club , the Country Club of Havana and the Casino Espanol Country Club . <p> All gone now . <p> They were symbols of imperialist decadence that the revolution vowed to wipe out , and did . Communism was supposed to make everybody equal . <p> " It 's sad , what happened , " says Olga Fridman , a sixtysomething founding member of the Big Five . She 's sitting in the dim bar with her jeweler companion , Alfredo Jaume , 67 . They 're drinking red wine and listening to two musicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful , " Fridman sighs . She 's wearing tight bell-bottoms with a rhinestone belt , and her bangle bracelets clink as she reaches for her wineglass . " Our clubs gave us a certain status , a security . I used to take siestas every afternoon there in the sun by the water . Fidel wanted to put everyone on the same level  --  poor and miserable . Except for himself and a few of his friends , of course . " <p> Castro has to go , but how ? " Invasion , " says Jaume . But he does n't believe it will happen , certainly not with a Democrat in the White House . No , an uprising will have to happen inside Cuba . " When hunger reaches the Cuban military , they 'll take him out . " <p> He 's built a life here now , he says , " but at least I 'll go back to visit . " Fridman is not sure she will . " I think I 'm too old now . " <p> Jaume takes out his wallet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Casino Espanol membership pass , dated 1957 . <p> " See ? " he says . " It 's my little keepsake . " <p> The Once Hungry <p> Seven roasted pork loins are cooling on the counter behind the bar of Latin American . It is lunchtime , and the small southwest 57th Avenue restaurant-takeout is packed . Everyone 's waiting for Arcenio Ruiz , 26 , king of the Sandwich Cubano . That Ruiz is actually Salvadoran is irrelevant to the faithful crowd of 50 or so Cuban Americans who come here every day . After all , a good sandwich is like a good cigar  --  Cuban . The creator is not important . <p> " Cubans have a fixation with food , " Ruiz notes . " And this sandwich is number one because it 's got everything . " <p> Ruiz sells more than 400 of these sandwiches daily  --  stuffed with ham , pork , Swiss cheese and dill pickles , then clamped inside a steaming sandwich press to melt the cheese . He works on an elevated platform for all to see ; you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knife as he sharpens it against a stone . <p> Judith Cruz , 27 , watches Ruiz closely with her deep brown eyes . She 's one of a dozen waitresses here . <p> " I love working around so much food ! " she says happily , serving a sandwich to a middle-aged man nursing a chocolate milkshake . A not atypical business lunch in this neighborhood . <p> " Because when I left Cuba in 1980 during the Mariel boat lift , " Cruz says , " we never had enough to eat . Now it 's become even worse . How were the talks in New York supposed to fill empty bellies ? Thirty-five years later , Fidel is still the only beneficiary . And the refugees in Guantanamo , what will become of them now ? They do n't care where in America they 're sent . They just want a new life and food . Food , food , food is the only thing that interests them at the moment . See how Fidel has destroyed the Cuban mind ? We 've all become ravenous little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you spend all day scrounging for your next meal ? <p> The customer is wolfing down his Cubano as she talks , and Cruz anticipates his wish . " Oye , Arcenio ! " she hollers . " Another sandwich Cubano , por favor ! " <p> The Refugee Problem <p> " I would commit suicide if I were a refugee in Guantanamo now , " says Odalys Diaz-Negrin . " What got resolved during the negotiations in New York was that they reached an agreement . Big deal . I think it 's radical and cruel to withdraw the opportunity for people to come here . " <p> The honey-blond 35-year-old beautician , who also came to Miami in 1980 through the Mariel boat lift , is massaging warm cream into the tanned calf of her latest pedicure client , Mirta Torres , 62 . For the past decade , Diaz-Negrin has worked on fingers and toes here at Foxy Hair Designers , an unpretentious Calle Ocho salon . For Cuban women , the manicure and the pedicure are not luxuries , but rituals . <p> " No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diaz-Negrin continues , reaching for a pumice stone . " The exiles will never go for that . On the other hand , Miami will never accept another Mariel . But look , in Mariel , I and 130,000 other Cubanos came here and the city survived it . We were absorbed . Florida 's a big state , and America 's a huge country . Each refugee should be processed individually , to weed out the criminals and delinquents . And then , if you 're willing to work or if you 've got family here who 'll take financial responsibility for you , you should be allowed to come . " <p> " Mommy came here at night in a boat , " says her daughter , Audrey , 5 . She 's speaking in breathless Spanglish . " And the water was dark , dark blue and Mommy threw up and there was a lot of ondas waves and a big hueso bone came . " <p> Audrey is referring to her mother 's rough passage , during which a human bone was washed up on deck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her toenails are being painted flamingo pink . " I 've lived here in Miami since I left Cuba in ' 62 . And I still always say , ' When I go back to Cuba ... ' Ay ! I am appalled by the refugees ' situation . But until when can this country keep taking people ? " <p> " You could put them in Montana , " offers Diaz-Negrin . " Or Wyoming . There are n't enough people there , that 's what I heard . " <p> " But what Cuban wants to live there ? " Torres asks . " Even if you did put them in those places , they 'd find their way back to Miami in one day ! It 's just like those lost pets you hear about , that smell their way home . God , the people coming out of Cuba now look really frightening . They 're strange-looking , like they 're in a mystery movie . " <p> " Ghosts , " says Diaz-Negrin , guiding Torres ' perfectly polished feet off her lap and onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Exaggerated People ' <p> Two Cuban American waiters on an espresso break are taking in the South Beach scene : Latter-day hippies and would-be models stroll past the palm trees and snow-white stretch limos and sable Porsches parked along Ocean Drive . This is the neon-lit southern end of Miami Beach , the Art Deco District . The sidewalk is jammed with poodles , cafes , smart boutiques and skinny people dressed all in black , smoking Dunhills and speaking urgently into their portable telephones . The slinky rhythms of Cuban jazz stray from the open windows of hotels painted the colors of saltwater taffy . <p> " Mariel and ' Miami Vice ' were what started this scene , " says George , 33 , one of the waiters . Like his friend Andres , he does n't want to give his last name . <p> " Without those two things , " George continues , " this place would still be a sleepy little dump . Mariel criminals scared off the elderly people who used to live here . Then younger people like us moved in because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show made it chic . " <p> George arrived in Miami in ' 74 ; Andres , 26 , was born here . His family fled Cuba in ' 65 . <p> Their neighborhood of choice is very groovy indeed , but only superficially apolitical ; the youthful and more liberal-minded Cuban Americans who reside on this island , which is a literal and figurative bay away from Little Havana , are as outspoken as their hard-liner counterparts on the mainland . <p> " You know what ? " says Andres . " The same people who threw rocks at my parents for wanting to defect are the ones who jumped at the chance to go on Mariel 15 years later . " <p> " That 's why we like South Beach , " says George , removing his black suede Birkenstock sandal to shake out the sand . " It has a more open-minded way of thinking than Little Havana . There 's so much drama involved there , so much emotion . Besides , we 're gay , and they 're into major fag-bashing out there . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 're exaggerated people . I guess we are warmblooded . " <p> " We most definitely have a bad karma , " George opines . " I mean , Batista was a son of a bitch too . Castro did not happen out of the blue . The older generation acts as if everything was fine and dandy before Castro , which is ludicrous . There were no human rights ; it was very corrupt . Everybody knows that tourists came to Havana to gamble and screw around . In 35 years , we have n't learned a thing . The exiles in Miami are as intolerant of dissent as Fidel is in Cuba . It 's kind of ironic and ridiculous , but that 's why we do n't want you to put our last names in the paper . Not because we 're homosexual  --  we 're both out  --  but for our politics . You have to be so careful with what you say ... " <p> " A lot of the exiles are sort of fascist , " Andres adds . <p> " Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to happen . Fanaticism wo n't lead us to solutions . It 's time to let it go . I just do n't know what we 'll replace it with . " <p> " Castro 's about to die any minute now , " says Andres hopefully . " Do n't you think ? " <p> To See Cuba Again ... <p> " ASESINAR AL ASESINO FIDEL ! " yells a teenage girl to any passerby . " ARE YOU WITH US OR AGAINST US ? " <p> She 's yelling from the back of a flatbed truck as it rolls east down Calle Ocho , past Maximo Gomez Park on 15th Avenue , in one of the spontaneous demonstrations that erupt here daily . Cuban and American flags are waved furiously from the windows of the truck 's cab , the horn honks relentlessly . A passerby offers a thumbs-up to the girl . <p> Thirty feet away , a sign lists rules for park behavior . PROHIBIDO : GRITAR is rule No. 1 . No yelling . Smoking is also prohibited , but cigars are omnipresent . How can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , aromatic stogie fixed between your teeth ? <p> Thirty elderly Cuban men are competing here today in " Domino " Park , seated in fours around Formica-covered tables under a tiled roof . " This is our refuge , " explains Rafael de la Torres , 80 . He and his partner just wiped out their challengers . Torres is wearing the traditional Cuban man 's pleated shirt , the guayabera . A Little Havana resident since ' 63 , Torres is a retired hotel restaurant busboy . He comes to the park every day . <p> " It 's a peaceful way to spend the time , " Torres says . " And we viejos old folks do n't fit in anywhere else . See , dominoes come from the time of the Espanoles . It 's our national hobby . It 's a war game , like what 's going on between Cuba and the U.S. Two great competitors , fighting to win . <p> " It 's a mess ! " Torres exclaims . " Of course , that diabolical , exploitative bastard Fidel was selling rafts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't think Clinton would ever do something like that , let people be eaten by sharks . I do feel terrible about the refugees ' fate , just terrible . " <p> Torres once worked as a public service inspector under the Batista regime . He is grateful to the United States for offering him refuge and is impatient with his compatriots who criticize the administration . " It 's stupid to speak badly of America . The Americans are taking care of these poor rafters . This country is too noble . <p> " An invasion would be a disaster , " he says . " An agreement between the two countries will come with time . " <p> Six o'clock . The park is closing . An armed security guard asks everyone to wrap it up . As dominoes are stashed in pouches , the exuberant chirp of a hundred unseen birds emanates from inside a leafy green tree . <p> " Do you hear those sparrows ? " Torres asks , squinting up at the treetop . " Their song reminds me of birds I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We used to go there to play dominoes and be together . Ay , Jesus , I hope I see Cuba again in my lifetime . "
