Last week America set about smashing china and moving furniture around in the household of its public morality , with the knowledge that before it was all over no one would know where to find anything anymore . Conversation became suddenly careful ; the pinups were peeled off the wall . The issue of sexual harassment  --  what it is , why it happens , who 's to blame  --  was a fascinating topic to obsess upon as a nation , wonder about in private , argue about in public . It was also a long , bruising week of bumping into issues that many of us did n't know were there . <P> In America 's workplaces , men and women reintroduced themselves with a suspicion that their relationships had changed forever . Men who have worked closely with women for years asked them flat out , " Have you ever felt threatened or insulted or offended by anything I 've said or done ? " Many women privately shared their experiences and their anger , for the first time taking seriously behavior they had long taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast as victims , wondered whether in the end all the sudden attention to the issue would do them more harm than good . <P> The issue of sexual harassment ricochets off other crucial debates this country has yet to resolve about the boundaries of morality and law . The boss who kept his employees ' menstrual cycles marked on a wall calendar was , by any measure , a lout . Was he a criminal ? How useful is it to establish a category of behavior that runs the gamut from rudeness to rape ? Should it be embedded in the law that men and women react differently to the same comments and behavior ? <P> The questions and conversations were all the more pointed because , despite the clarity of the legal language , sexual harassment is a complex issue , its incidence difficult to measure . It is uniformly cast as a gender issue , since the overwhelming majority of cases involve female workers being harassed by male colleagues and supervisors . But when pollsters ask women whether they have ever been targets of harassment , the answers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain why some surveys find that 90% of women view themselves as victims and others find less than half that number . <P> As last week 's crash course made clear , most women and men , especially most + Senators , had only the barest understanding of the power of the law . Under Equal Employment Opportunity Commission guidelines issued in 1980 and unanimously affirmed by the Supreme Court in 1986 , sexual harassment includes not just physical but also verbal and " environmental " abuse . Under the law , there are two broadly recognized forms . The first involves a " quid pro quo " in which a worker is compelled to trade sex for professional survival . In 1986 an Ohio woman won a $3.1 million verdict against an employer who invited her to perform oral sex or lose her job .
