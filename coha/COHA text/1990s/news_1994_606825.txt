<p> For those who study the brain , perhaps the toughest question has always been : Who 's minding the store ? <p> From Plato to the late 19th century , the answer was simple : There must be one central control mechanism ( Descartes imagined it as a homunculus or little man ) that oversees all the separate mental functions . But lately  --  and especially in the past few years  --  many scientists have come to believe that the brain is more like a committee without a chairman , in which rogue members may sometimes act alone or fail to show up for meetings . <p> Such discoveries , Washington neurologist Richard M. Restak explains in his new book , " The Modular Brain , " are part of a " truly revolutionary theory of the brain 's operation , modular theory . " This view " holds that our experience is not a matter of combining at one master site ... all the separate components into one central perception . As strange as it may sound , there is no master site , no center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although massively interconnected  --  do their work simultaneously in parallel . <p> It now seems probable , he writes , that " knowledge within the brain is not stored as a unity ( a tiger ) but according to separate components or modules ( the sight of the tiger , its roar , its smell , etc . ) . Further , some of these modular components may malfunction without affecting any of the others . " <p> Take the strange case of patient S.M. , reported by a team from the University of Iowa College of Medicine in last week 's issue of the journal Nature . This 30-year-old woman with a normal IQ but a " remarkable " history of " defective personal and social decision-making " suffers from a rare form of brain damage that destroyed an almond-sized structure called the amygdala . <p> As a result , she is almost completely deficient at recognizing fear in pictures of faces . She also does not perceive much similarity between even closely related facial expressions such as happiness and surprise . Yet she can immediately recognize pictures of familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ) , and can easily learn to recognize new ones . <p> Tiny Amygdala 's Big Role <p> The findings not only indicate that the tiny amygdala may play an enormous role in discerning the emotional significance of social situations , but also that mental processing of facial identity and facial emotion are very different activities that take place in " anatomically separable neural systems . " <p> " It 's really no different , " said neurologist Antonio Damasio , who heads the Iowa team , " from what we now know is happening in language systems "  --  for example , that nouns and verbs are processed in different parts of the brain . <p> Other kinds of localized brain damage can lead to a variety of peculiar problems that Restak describes , including one subject who lost the ability to name animals but could easily name inanimate objects , another who could recognize tools but not musical instruments , and yet another who was unable to tell whether a bee or a house was larger , though she knew exactly what bees and houses were . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altering the brains of animals to see how individual parts affect perception or behavior ; and waiting for the rare human patient who has a highly localized brain defect . <p> Patient S.M. 's case is uniquely valuable because only her amygdala was destroyed , thus allowing researchers to investigate the specific role of the mysterious organ and to compare their findings with the results of animal experiments . <p> There have been enough of those to indicate that the amygdala is intimately involved in making correct social judgments as well as imprinting memories with emotional meaning . When lab monkeys have their amygdalas destroyed , they lose their normal hostility to the approach of human experimenters and much of their ability to determine which direction a face is looking . In the wild , such animals can not find their place in the group hierarchy , " lose their ability to pick up the social signals that bind members of the colony into a unit , " and make sounds that " lack appropriate emotional overtones , " Restak writes . <p> In addition , the amygdala appears indispensable in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rats to fear a sound by following it with a stomp of the experimenter 's foot . But when their amygdalas were damaged  --  and everything else was normal  --  no amount of stomping could make them afraid . <p> Patient S.M. 's impaired recognition of fear provides startling new evidence of the human amygdala 's function and the brain 's modularity . Ten years ago , Damasio said , it would have been quite reasonable to assume that the amygdala was involved in processing perception of all emotions . But " the very striking finding of this study is that it seems to be that it is preferentially involved with fear , " he said . That suggests that perhaps " in many other aspects of brain function , neural systems are not general purpose , but are highly selective . " <p> Defects , Autism and Depression <p> To two California researchers , writing in a companion editorial in Nature , it also suggests that amygdalar defects might play a role in autism , because " autistic children are inattentive to facial expression and it seems that they fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similarly " distorted perception of social signals " could contribute to cases of paranoid delusion . <p> The amygdala has already been implicated in at least one common form of depression that seems to run in families . PET scans of the brains of such subjects while they were depressed showed notably abnormal activity in the amygdala and several surrounding areas . Scans during periods of normal moods , however , showed abnormal activity only in the amygdala . Neuroscientists Michael Posner and Marcus Raichle speculate in their 1994 book , " Images of Mind , " that the amygdala and nearby structures play " a major role in assigning emotional significance to the life experiences that we hold in long-term memory . " <p> In his new book " Descartes ' Error , " Damasio lays out a provocative theory of how such an imprinting process might work , through a **27;356;TOOLONG loop . A stimulus ( say , a growl ) prompts the amygdala and related brain structures  --  collectively known as the limbic system  --  to produce a set of physiological responses ( such as increased heart rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceived by the limbic system and stamped as an emotional " somatic marker " on the memory of the experience . When the experience is recalled , the person will have a positive or negative " gut response " that aids in decision-making . If the marker is defective , decisions based on those memories will be faulty , maladaptive or even psychopathic . <p> A defective amygdala may not necessarily be the cause of S.M. 's poor social judgment , Iowa researcher Ralph Adolphs cautioned , because plenty of people with normal brain activity do things that are not in their best interest . <p> Nonetheless , Damasio said , it is now generally clear that " emotion is part and parcel of what we call cognition . If there is severe impairment of the emotions , we can not have rationality . " <p> CAPTION : BRAINS , FACES AND FEAR <p> Scientists learn about the functions of individual brain parts by testing patients who have very specific brain damage . One is S.M. , a woman whose amygdala was destroyed by a rare disease . Researchers showed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise , fear , anger , disgust and sadness ) and combinations of those emotions , and then compared her responses to those of 19 control subjects : 12 with damage to other parts of their brains and seven normal persons . <p> * Unlike the other subjects , S.M. could not recognize fear when shown images such as the one on the left . In addition , she was unable to perceive similarity between emotions ( such as surprise and happiness ) , and could not discern combinations of feelings such as sadness and disgust shown in the image at the right . <p> SOURCE : Paul Ekman , Pictures of Facial Affect ( Consulting Psychologists Press , 1976 ) <p> Photos courtesy of Consulting Psychologists Press Inc. , Palo Alto , Calif . <p> CAPTION : * The amygdala ( from the Latin word for almond ) is part of a group of deep structures called the limbic system , which includes the hippocampus , hypothalamus and cingulate gyrus .
