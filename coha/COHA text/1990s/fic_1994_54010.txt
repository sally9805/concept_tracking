THE DRESS , WHEN SHE FINDS it , is pink . It smells richly of lavender , slightly of camphor , an uneasy mixture in the stifling heat of the attic . Ruth sits back on her heels and holds the thing out before her wonderingly . From the style , it would be from before she was married , when she was still living with Aunt Min , the summer she was wild , going out to Coney on the weekends with that girl from her office . She imagines herself in the dress , poised before a mirror . <p> A door slams downstairs . Peg , on her way out to God knows where . On the surface of the cloth Ruth sees the argument an hour before , her daughter standing in the attic doorway shouting that she is old enough to run her own life . " I bring home my pay , do n't I ? I 'm entitled to a little fun . You just do n't know the way things are . " Sees herself , all the love and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth when she tries to caution her only child , her baby . The headache that began an hour ago dances hotly behind Ruth 's eyes . Her eyes and throat itch . <p> Ruth shakes the dress out brusquely . Why did I keep it , she wonders . There is yellowed lace at the collar ; on one side there is a small brown stain , almost invisible . When she looks at the dress Ruth feels a frisson of fear and something she almost does n't recognize : a sudden unnerving sexual pang . That was the summer that . . . she begins , then can not finish the thought . Memories of that summer are immediate , but something eludes her . Did something happen ? She tries hard , going beyond the heat and dust in the attic , beyond the pain that makes her vision jump with each pulse ; Ruth knows the dress means something , but can not recall what . <p> The summer when she was wild , she calls it in her memory . But what we thought was wicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  what was her name ? Leda McHale  --  back to Leda 's to sleep on the trundle in Leda 's own bedroom , as chaste as a nun . I should go downstairs now , she thinks . But downstairs will be empty of Peg , gone off to a football party at college with one of those boys . Downstairs will be full of Peg 's discarded stockings and teddies , the purple cloche hanging off the newel post , the scent of Peg 's too strong , too suggestive perfume . Peg does n't understand , does n't know what she 's doing , how dangerous it is to tempt those boys . She 's too young - what 's eighteen years ? She does n't know how men can be . Ruth knows . <p> The dress , when she found it , was pink . It hung in the window of Hooley 's Dry Goods and Ladies ' Furnishings and cost Ruth almost a week 's wage from her job as a type-writer . The bodice draped to a short waist , the sleeves teardrop-shaped with lace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose high , high on the throat , to just under her chin . In it Ruth , with her soft , rounded chin and strawberry blonde hair , looked like an illustration from the Home Journal . The mirror and the salesgirl both told her so . She bought it knowing that Aunt Min would purse her lips at the price . <p> On Saturday , early , she donned the dress , pinned her hair up under a small , flirtatious straw hat , and told Aunt Min she was going on a picnic with a friend from the 17th Street Methodist Church choir . Then Ruth was gone , gone to meet her best friend Leda , Leda 's brother Jonah , and Jonah 's fiancee Pearline , to catch the train to Coney . <p> Going to Coney . It was forbidden fruit ; Aunt Min read the Police Gazette with as much fervor as her Bible , and knew chapter and verse about the vice and depravity practiced at Coney : men and women clinging to each other on the great wheel , five-cent beers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended to spend the day she would have locked her in her room and read temperance lectures to her through the keyhole . <p> The train ride felt endless . In the heat Ruth 's hair began to come down in rosy wisps , sticking to her cheeks and neck . She dabbed ineffectively at the beads of perspiration on upper lip and brow with a handkerchief , stealing a glance at the other women in the ear . All of them were flushed and moist , languorous in the heat . Leda and Pearline giggled and poked at each other and at Ruth ; Jonah slept through their mirth with his boater drawn down over his eyes , the tips of his waxed mustache gleaming in the sunlight . <p> When they got off the train it was all spread before them . Steeplechase and Dreamland , Luna Park , the grand old resort hotels down the coast , the Boardwalk . Revitalized by the freshening breeze from the water , Leda and Ruth immediately wanted to run ahead . But Pearline wanted a lemonade , and to sit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lemonade and tried not to listen while Jonah and Pearline whispered to each other on their side of the table . Ruth was astonished at their shamelessness , but no one else seemed to notice or care . Leda caught a man staring at her , and when she frowned he tipped his hat and smiled , and Leda giggled nervously into Ruth 's shoulder . At last , with lemonade still sticky on their lips , they left the stand for the parks , Ruth looked back over her shoulder to make sure the man had not followed after them . <p> For hours they rode the rides , squealing at every bump and whirl and breathtaking turn . Pearline nestled against Jonah , shrieking until he tightened the arm that circled her waist ; Leda and Ruth clung to each other in delicious terror . Under the grinning supervision of Tilyou 's great clown they gorged themselves on up and down and sideways motion . Then they went down Surf Avenue to Luna Park to watch the Great Naval Spectacular , arguing which park was the best . Leda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectacles . Then , at dusk , they came to Dreamland , and Ruth knew which park was her favorite . <p> The clock downstairs strikes five o'clock . Ruth starts , looks up , remembers that Peg is gone and that Peg 's father wo n't be home from the lodge until late . She has the house to herself tonight , big and empty . <p> They have done well , they own the house outright , even have a broker and stocks ; Peg went to a good school for young ladies across town , and Ruth has a girl in three times a week to help with the house and do the heavy cleaning . It is more than she ever dreamed of , growing up in Brooklyn . The house is big , the girl wo n't come again until Monday , Peg has gone out against Ruth 's wishes , traveling with that fast crowd , college boys . Ruth can smell the danger of them when they come to the house . Why ca n't Peg understand ? What is it that drives her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gin breath unsuccessfully disguised with peppermints ? But even as Ruth thinks " I never . . . " the dress in her hands belies the thought . She can remember the thrill of sneaking out , doing the forbidden , going to the forbidden place . More : when she looks at the collar she remembers the way it circled her throat so that her chin nestled in a ruffle of lace . Remembers tilting her head until it was cupped by the lace as if it were a firm , cool hand . Remembers the hand tracing a path from her ear down along her throat , slowly and caressingly . Abruptly she looks away . <p> The dress , when she found it , was pink , jumbled in the comer with half a dozen other garments , its soft fabric creased and dotted with greasy spots , a clump of dust clinging to the fold of the bodice . On the high lace collar , so tiny one could miss it , a stain in the shape of a perfect droplet , rusty red . Ruth shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was hot in her room , stifling , and the sunlight brought on a headache as she looked at the dress . Something . . . . Aunt Min bustled in to borrow a pair of gloves for church and saw Ruth 's headache written clearly across her face . Then it was a matter of cool compresses , Aunt Min 's assurances that the Almighty would excuse her missing Sunday services this once . Min herself drew the shades and dabbed at Ruth 's temples with lavender water until Ruth wanted to scream . Finally she went off to church , the feather in her hat standing righteously erect . <p> The dress still hung over the back of her wicker armchair . As she stared at it a whisper threaded Ruth 's memory : rose pink lady . Who called her that ? With each glance at the dress the sense that she should remember was fainter , less imperative . At last she got up and hung the dress in her clothes press and lay down to wait out the headache . <p> When she awoke it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quiet road at twilight . <p> * * * The world went away when you entered Dreamland and there was nothing but light and music and people everywhere . They went first to the Venetian Canals , where Pearline and Jonah rode the gondola , heads close together with the boatman 's uninterested chaperonage . Then Leda wanted to see the midgets ; Pearline wanted to see Creation . Ruth did n't care : everything was fine with her in Dreamland . <p> As they walked along they were hailed by the barker from the Congress of Living Wonders . Jonah shook his head and pulled Pearline after him . Leda followed . Behind them , Ruth looked over at the platform for a moment . She was about to turn away when she saw a man looking at her . She blinked and he tipped his hat and smiled . He must mean some other girl , she thought . But she hung back , delighted and appalled to realize that he was looking at her . Of all the women in the crowd he chose her to smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruth stood rock still , looking at him . What does he want ? she wondered , and answered herself : he wanted something . That was what Aunt Min would say . Men always wanted some unimaginable something . For the first time in her life Ruth wondered , seriously wondered , what the something was . <p> He stood a few feet behind the barker , near the curtain at the back of the platform . He did n't seem to have a part in the show ; he was simply observing . Ruth was so fascinated by the dark sparkle of the man and the flush of excitement that made her blush , that she did n't see Leda and Jonah and Pearline continuing on to the Creation pavilion , pushing through the crowd as oblivious to her loss as she was to their absence . <p> He was dark and polished , like an onyx pebble . His pearl gray suit was fresh despite the heat , his tie and collar crisp at his throat . His eyes were dark as onyx and his smile had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform the barker spoke insinuatingly , drawing the crowd in to see the Bearded Lady , the Man with Two Mouths . As she pushed forward with them , searching for a coin in her pocketbook , a hand at her elbow stopped her . He was there beside her , the onyx-dark man , saying , " Keep your money , darling . It will be my pleasure . " <p> Blushing , Ruth let him guide her into the show . Light from the incandescents flooded the area unevenly , leaving dark pockets between the exhibits ; they gave a low sizzling noise which blended into the calls and sighs and shrieks of the crowd and the performers . They paced leisurely from one platform to the next as the barker 's feverish baritone extolled the strangeness of this one , the awfulness of that . Ruth listened with half an ear , distracted by the presence of the onyx man at her side . His light touch on her elbow that kept her constantly aware of things she had never known existed : heat and scent and male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ruth accepted each of them without question because they were dressed in his glamor . He murmured softly into her ear until she giggled nervously at his comments about the fat lady 's beard and the sword-swallower 's wrinkled tights . His breath was hot in her ear , moving the strands of her red hair against her cheek . When they came to the show 's end and the barker exhorted the audience to Come Again , Come Again , Ladeees and Gentle-men , the stranger leaned close . " Rose-pink lady , " he murmured . " Will you take a walk with me ? " <p> Then they parted from the audience and left the hall by a doorway in the rear , their passage noted by the barker with a knowing glance . Her onyx-dark man led her through an alley and out into the main street , and they sauntered like any other summer beaux in the crowded lamplight . A sudden turn just past the Hellgate , down an alley , and then he brought Ruth through a door and into a dusty vaulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street ; Ruth blinked owlishly . She could make out wooden struts and draped canvas . There was a strong smell of paint and varnish and moldy sawdust . Ruth turned toward the man only to find him there beside her , very close . He traced the bow of her upper lip with one long finger , a gesture which shocked Ruth and moved her in a way she could not understand . When she closed her eyes she could feel his breath on her ear again . Inside her something like Aunt Min 's voice told her to run for her life . <p> " Rose-pink lady , " he murmured again . <p> Ruth did n't move , except to tilt her face up to his . <p> Leda was waiting for her at the Beacon Tower . <p> " Where 've you been ? " she fluttered . " Jo and Pearlie are looking for you everywhere , we thought you were lost . Ruthie , you all right ? " <p> Ruth smiled and nodded and said she 'd just lost them in the crowd . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Leda shook her head . They had been searching for Ruth . Jonah was fit to be tied . <p> " We 'll have to come out again , " Ruth said softly . " There is so much to see yet . " <p> Then Jonah and Pearline found them . Ruth endured their scolding all the way to the train station , and until they boarded the car back to Flatbush Avenue . She slept on the trip back , stumbled into Aunt Min 's flat , got herself to bed somehow . Already she was thinking of next Saturday . <p> THE NEXT time it was all familiar : the parks , the paths that connected from one to the other . The excitement that traced pathways along the nerves when you first stood there at dusk surrounded by the lights and the smells and the sounds and the tastes and the people . When they reached Dreamland Jonah took Pearline and Leda off to the midget city and they agreed to meet at the tower at nine . Ruth had told them she was meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed her ; Pearline and Leda winked broadly and took him away before he could ask too many questions . Helping Ruth , each girl borrowed a little of her adventure , thrilled to their own illicit part in her drama . <p> From the gates of the park it took Ruth only a few minutes to find the Congress of Wonders . By the curtains at the back of the platform she saw him , dark and polished . His smile gleamed in the dusk , and Ruth 's pulse began a slow , dramatic hammering . He knew she had come to find him , she knew he knew . Everything would move forward now from that knowledge . <p> He took her elbow and guided her forward , smiling solicitously . <p> " I do n't know your name , " she heard herself say . His eyes were very dark . <p> " Adam , " he said quietly . <p> This time he did not take her to the backstage of Hellgate . Instead they walked a thread through canvas tunnels , alleys , under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overshadowed by the parks , glistened in the moonlight . He held Ruth 's fingers in his own cool , dry hand . After a while they took their shoes and socks off and walked with the sand between their toes . They talked , then were silent . <p> When she met the others at the Beacon Tower later she walked slowly , as if her blood had taken on the rhythm of the sea . On the long train ride back to Flatbush Avenue Ruth 's hand floated at her chin and caressed the lace collar of her dress . <p> That night she slept at Leda 's . Her dreams were full of darkness and rhythm , the touch of his hand , of his lips . <p> What is it about the college , about those boys that Peg finds so attractive ? Ruth frowns in the dimness of the attic . I should turn the electric on , she thinks , but does n't get up to flip the light switch . Those boys , most of them cheap , stupid . They have raccoon coats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 'll waste herself on one of those boys , break her heart . None of them will stay with her , marry her , take care of her . She needs a nice , safe man like her father . She does n't understand what I want to spare her . <p> Under her hands , which clench and twist , the fabric of the dress tears slightly , releasing more lavender scent on the air . The summer I went to Coney , she thinks . Over and over , every Saturday all summer long , with Aunt Min wondering and worrying and silent as a stone , just looking down her nose on Sunday mornings when I came home from Leda 's . She stares at the dress in her hands and slowly smooths the creases away . <p> During the week Ruth was quiet and thoughtful . She did her work quietly , did n't spend much time talking to the other girls in the office . She browsed the shops looking at dresses , but she had a superstitious feeling about wearing any other dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to choir rehearsal on Tuesday nights and helped with Aunt Min 's Friday socials , pouring out weak tea for hours without protest . She carried her secret like an amulet against boredom and frustration ; it took so little to recall the feelings of Coney , the looseness and languor , the hot urgent pressing of his lips against her throat . On Saturday mornings she woke up , really awake , and dressed in the pink dress again , and went to meet Leda and the others for the ride out to Coney . <p> After a few weeks , Leda suggested they go somewhere else on Saturday . To the country for a picnic , to the city for a show . Ruth smiled and said perhaps , but each Saturday they went to Coney . Pearline saw her fill and more of the miracle babies and Jonah watched the end of Pompeii until he was sick of it , but as long as they could sit in a gondola or on a wooden horse , pressed together , they were willing to go out to Coney again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but none did , no matter how she giggled and flirted her eyebrows . As the summer went on Leda giggled less . Ruth did n't share her adventure with Leda , forgot to ask if Leda had any beaux or flirtations . Leda , who had always been the forward , kittenish one , began to look confused and hurt . Ruth did not notice . <p> August turned chilly for a few days , Aunt Min took her mantle from the back of the closet to wear for church , and Ruth took to carrying a shawl with her . On a Wednesday at the office , Leda told Ruth that she and Jonah had a christening to go to that weekend . " We 'll have to go to Coney next week , " she said , not bothering to hide her satisfaction . <p> Ruth panicked . <p> She went through the day thinking , how can I go out there ? For a moment she thought , maybe Pearlie will go with me . But Pearline would probably go to the christening . Even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoned at Dreamland while Ruth went off on her own . As she transcribed pages of manuscript on the typewriter her mind was at Coney with him . How could she get out to Coney ? She even thought , perhaps Aunt Min ? No , not until Hell froze over , maybe not even then . The more she thought , the more it seemed that she would really die if she could n't get out to Dreamland on Saturday . Her thought was rattled by the pounding of the typewriter under her fingers . After a while even Saturday seemed too far off . What would he think when she did n't come ? Would he forgive her ? Would he smile on someone else ? Ruth imagined his beautiful smile for someone else . She had to tell him she was n't coming , that it was n't her fault or her idea . All afternoon the feeling grew strong , so that fear fed more fear , and she could n't stand it that she would n't see him tonight , tell him everything , how Leda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep them apart . <p> At six o'clock she left the office with the other girls , Ruth turned left instead of right . Leda , waiting for her a few steps away , called after her . <p> " Ruthie , whererya going ? " <p> Without turning Ruth called back , " You know where I 'm going . " <p> What happened that summer ? <p> The thought catches Ruth by surprise . What is happening to Peg right now , that 's more important than what happened twenty years ago on a beach miles away . The answers seem intertwined to her , they stand on each other 's shoulders , if she can answer the one she 'll know the other . Why did I keep this dress ? The answer comes : to remind me . <p> Of what ? <p> The train was n't full , but there were still people , even families going out . Ruth felt they were looking at her , all alone with no friend , no chaperoned . She pulled her shawl tighter around her and clutched her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? At the sight of him she knew her doubts would melt away . Everything would be all right when she saw him . She twirled a strand of hair around her finger and stared out the window toward the nearing glow of Coney 's lights . <p> When she got off the train it was all familiar but different . Fewer people , fewer families . More young men lounging on the benches , eyeing her , calling out Hello , Sweetheart and Looking for Me , Girlie ? Even inside the gates of Dreamland everything felt subtly wrong the music too sharp , the lights too bright , the laughter too coarse and familiar . For the first time Dreamland was not an enchanted village but a playground , loud and vulgar . She thought , it 's not a dream , it 's a nightmare . <p> He was n't at the Congress of Wonders . The barker saw her , all right : tipped his bowler and smirked , and then pursed his lips in a soundless whistle as if he knew something she did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the freak show ; the barker did n't try to stop her , no one demanded money . She just pushed in and pushed through , ignoring the freaks , looking for a dark head , a white smile . When she came out the exit she pushed on to Hellgate . All the places he had taken her , the backstage areas , the cul-de-sacs between rides and exhibitions , even the shadowy path under the Boardwalk were hard to find , although she had thought she knew them . <p> When she reached the beach at last she was exhausted and bedraggled . The hem of her brown twill skirt was soggy and stained , and her white shirtwaist was creased and dirty . She held her hat in one hand ; it had come off when she climbed under the stanchions of the Boardwalk . Where are you , she prayed . Please find me , please . <p> In the moonlight the ocean looked like a flat , tranquil mirror . A hundred feet away she saw him , gray and silver in the moonlight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ruth gasped in relief and began to cross the sand . He turned at the sound and she saw : there was a girl in his arms , pale and fair , her face turned up to his . What was worse , Adam 's face when he saw Ruth was perfectly blank , as if he did n't know her at all . No fear , no explanation , no surprise . He was smooth and implacable as an onyx pebble . <p> Ruth turned and ran . <p> They found her at the Beacon Tower , waiting for them . When Jonah put his coat around her shoulders and Leda took her hand to lead her out of Dreamland , Ruth smiled and cried , as if she was too grateful to them ever to stop smiling , and too miserable ever to stop crying . She cried like a child , and felt like a child , pathetic , small and weary . When they got her on the train she slept all the way back , waking fitfully to clutch at Leda and weep again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Aunt Min 's icy disapproval vanished when she saw her niece 's gray , miserable face . Leda and Mfn put her to bed with a hot water bottle and a cool compress , and Ruth fell back into her restless sleep . Her dreams were full of darkness and rhythm , of pulses and heartbeat , the touch of Adam 's white hands ' on her , the weight of his body leaning in to her ; she dreamt of his breath cool in her ear , loosing a hot churning excitement in her belly and between her legs . His lips , tracing a path from her ear to her throat . His teeth , nipping gently , then piercing . Their cries , together , as he took from her and she gave , yielding everything up to him . His teeth at her throat , piercing neatly , releasing a flood of liquid heat through her arteries . It was everything she had heard of love : he told her it would only hurt once and then only pleasure , only joy . <p> The same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadows cast by the lights of Dreamland , the blood a black smear across his lips . <p> She woke early the next morning . The sunlight was white on the counterpane , unavoidable . Carefully folded on the chair by her wardrobe was the pink dress . For a moment on waking , Ruth remembered it all , everything . Then , as if it were blood seeping from an unseen wound , the memory began to leach out of her . Finally her recollection of Coney , of the whole summer , was as white and stainless as a bone . <p> When fall came Aunt Mfn packed the summer clothes away with lavender , as if to pack it all away . She never asked Ruth about what had happened that night , but it took weeks for the grim , suspicious look to fade entirely from her eyes . In the spring , sorting through the clothes , Ruth saw the pink dress , shook her head , put it back in the trunk . Not a style that wore well . <p> That winter , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dreamland burned down in ' 11 and all that was left were the Coney Island waltzes she danced at her wedding : " I 'll see you somewhere in Dreamland , somewhere in Dreamland , tonight . . . . " Ruth became a wife , then a mother . The Great War came and went . She had a home , a family , a good life . If it was not an exciting life , that was all right . The past shimmered in her mind as elusively as the lights of Coney Island and were lost in the safe , sunlit now . <p> A CRASH FROM downstairs . Startled from her reverie , alarmed by the series of thuds and crashes that are Peg making her way up the stairs , crying out wordlessly for her mother 's attention , Ruth hurriedly bundles the dress up and shoves it back in the chest . She blinks in the light of the upstairs hall and closes the attic door behind her . <p> " Peggy ? " she calls down urgently . A slurring voice answers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bathroom , where Peg is angrily scrubbing at her collar . <p> " Do n't start with me , Ma . " Peg refuses to meet her eye , stares resolutely at the mirror as she pokes angrily at a red stain on her collar . <p> Ruth stands for a moment , transfixed , the bottom dropping out of the world , everything . everything coming back to her in a flooding rush of memory . " What happened , baby ? " she asks like a prayer . Trembling . she brushes Peg 's hair back , away from her face and away from her throat ; sees the white , unmarred flesh . The memory is replaced by a surge of relief so powerful she wants to cry . Ruth does not pursue the memory but gathers her daughter into her arms , rocking silently . <p> Peg resists briefly . " Do n't start with me , Ma ! You were right , all right ? He got drunk , he started grabbing at me . I hate him , all right ? Is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , baby , no , " she says . " Hush , hush , it 's all right now . " Every hard thing Peg says is forgiven . Ruth thinks , You do n't understand . You ca n't understand . You do n't know how men can be . <p> Ruth knows . <p> <p> By Madeleine E. Robins <p> Madeleine Robins has sold six novels , the most recent being City of Fire to Tor Books .
