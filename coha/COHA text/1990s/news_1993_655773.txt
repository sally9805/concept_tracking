<p> ABDULLAH walks up the narrow stairs above his shop in this crowded Cairo slum . He points to the iron door at the entrance . <p> " When the government comes they do n't knock , " he says . <p> Abdullah , not his real name , is a short , stocky man with a bushy , salt-and-pepper beard . He wears a gray robe and black , unlaced sneakers . On his forehead is a brown callus caused by repeated supplications on his prayer rug . <p> A member of Egypt 's radical Gamaa Islamiya ( Islamic Group ) , Abdullah lives a precarious existence . His organization , whose spiritual leader is Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman , the Islamic preacher whose followers have been accused of bombing New York 's World Trade Center , seeks to replace the government of President Hosni Mubarak with a state based on the sharia or Islamic holy law . Members say that is the only way to end official corruption and alleviate worsening economic conditions . <p> As Egypt 's government responds to extremist violence with the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Anwar Sadat , Abdullah and his comrades are preparing for open confrontation with the state . <p> The streets of this slum , known as Imbaba , are piled high with garbage and glazed in dust - dust on the buildings , the stores , even the donkeys and their carts . Children with tangled hair play ball and idle men in dirty robes socialize over glasses of tea . Stray dogs scavenge through the trash . <p> It is in these indigent surroundings that militant Islamists plot the creation of an Islamic state . " We want sharia . That 's it , " says a local sheikh with a scraggly beard and dark-rimmed glasses . " When we apply what God says , everything will be alright . God will plant for us . God will bring us food . We wo n't need America anymore . " <p> They would even accept the present government if it would apply sharia , the sheikh says . But rather than listen to God , he argues , the administration follows the wishes of the United States . <p> Egypt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their struggle to establish a pure Islamic state . But last summer they increased their profile , bombing buses and cafes in a campaign of violence against foreign tourists . Although those attacks have fallen off , they embarrassed the government and continue to damage the tourism trade - the country 's main hard-currency earner at more than $ 3 billion per year . Egyptian officials estimate that the industry lost between $ 700 million and $ 1 billion last year due to the attacks . <p> Increasingly , the Mubarak administration has responded with force . In early December , 14,000 police raided Imbaba , detaining hundreds . In the latest action , security forces yesterday said they had arrested more than 800 suspected members of a previously unknown Islamist group . <p> ABDULLAH says the root cause of the Gamaa 's attacks against foreign tourists and Egyptians is the government , which Gamaa members say started the violence . " The police beat them the Islamic Group in the streets , so what should they do ? They must fight back , " he says through an interpreter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insist their main method of achieving a pure Islamic state is to invite people to believe in God . They are convinced enough Egyptians will eventually accept their invitation and force the secular government to become a religious one . <p> That calling has growing appeal for a population whose survival is becoming increasingly difficult . As Egypt moves toward a free market , prices are rising and the gap between upper and lower classes is growing . Government corruption and limited democratic freedoms increase people 's despair , further pushing them to join an opposing movement . <p> " Their the Gamaa 's message resonates for Egyptians for several reasons . One is a discrediting of politics , the other is a feeling of despair because of economic difficulties , " says Mohamad Sayed Ahmed , a prominent journalist . He cites " a feeling of injustice where some are so easily rich and others so poor without any explainable reasons . " <p> Abdullah , mild-mannered and courteous , does n't fit the common image of an extremist . He has three children - two teenage sons and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over her shoulders and reaches to her hands . Her blue skirt touches the floor . <p> The owner of a shop he took over from his father , he earns a salary of $ 300 per month , far above the country 's average monthly income of $ 40 . He did not go to college ; he left high school at 16 and joined the Army at 19 . He believes Egypt won the 1973 war against Israel , and did so because servicemen became more devout after the country 's 1967 defeat at Israeli hands . " We were victorious in ' 73 because we began to believe in God . " <p> After the Army he joined an extremist group in Imbaba that called for the government to implement the sharia . " When I saw the love between all the brothers , this affected me and I wanted to be like them , " he says . " They were trying truly to apply what I read in the Koran , " the holy book of Islam . He has gone to prison once or twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been tortured frequently while incarcerated . <p> " This no longer affects me , " he says , seated on the chair covered in pink and green flowered uphostery in the family 's sitting room . " I am used to being arrested and freed and arrested and freed . Its part of my struggle to believe in God , " he insists . " But it affects my family . " <p> Women and children have not been free from arrest . According to reports by the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights and the New York-based Middle East Watch , the Egyptian police detain and torture relatives of suspected Islamic militants to force extremists to give themselves in or to elicit information . <p> Officials deny these charges . " To act against the people 's human rights is a very dangerous crime in Egyptian law , " says Baha al-Din Ibrahim , an interior ministry spokesman . " If there are ... abuses the victim can ask the judge to take measures against those who commit this crime . " <p> " I get faint each time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the toll of her husband 's political leanings evident in her face . " I do n't sleep . I 'm afraid . " <p> Abdullah says his teenage son has been arrested twice since last fall . Three months ago the security forces blindfolded and beat him over a seven-day period . His son 's good friend , he says , who was detained at the same time , is still in prison . Four of the family 's friends have been killed . <p> " The government is wrong , thinking I am an extremist , " says the son , a whispery moustache on his upper lip . " I have n't done anything . I just pray at the mosque . " <p> Abdullah says some people in his neighborhood no longer speak to him because of his politics . The man who once delivered tea and coffee , for example , was beaten and interrogated by the police . He no longer comes . <p> Some in Imbaba are avenging their vendettas by turning innocent people into the security forces . " If someone hates someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a militant , " comments one resident . <p> SUSPICION is everywhere . Newcomers are eyed carefully . Questions are answered evasively . <p> But some in the community have not been cowed by the crackdown . Wealthier neighbors financially assist poorer families whose relatives have been arrested or killed . <p> The militants still gather in Abdullah 's shop . Most of the men in the shop have long beards , marking their religious convictions , some short and trimmed , others wild and unmanageable . <p> For many , the government crackdown and mass detentions just confirm their convictions . " Everytime they beat me I believe more in God , because religion is the only way , " says a carpenter .
