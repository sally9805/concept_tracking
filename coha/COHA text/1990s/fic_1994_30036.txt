Gone , But Not Forgotten Chapter One " Have you reached a verdict ? " Judge Alfred Neff asked the eight men and four women seated in the jury box . A heavy-set , barrel-chested man in his mid-sixties struggled to his feet . Betsy Tannenbaum checked the chart she had drawn up two weeks ago during jury selection . This was Walter Korn , a retired welder . Betsy felt uncomfortable with Korn as the foreman . He was a member of the jury only because Betsy had run out of challenges . The bailiff took the verdict form from Korn and handed it to the judge . Betsy 's eyes followed the folded square of white paper . As the judge opened it and read the verdict to himself , she watched his face for a telltale sign , but there was none . Betsy stole a glance at Andrea Hammermill , the plump , matronly woman sitting beside her . Andrea stared straight ahead , as subdued and resigned as she had been throughout her trial for the murder of her husband . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she explained why she shot Sidney Hammermill to death . As she told the jury about firing the revolver over and over until the dull click of hammer on steel told her there were no more bullets , her hands trembled , her body shook and she sobbed pitifully . " Will the defendant please stand , " Judge Neff said . Andrea got to her feet unsteadily . Betsy stood with her , eyes forward .

Andrea collapsed on her chair , sobbing into her hands . " It 's okay , " Betsy said , " it 's okay . " She felt tears on her cheeks as she wrapped a protective arm around Andrea 's shoulders . Someone tapped Betsy on the arm . She looked up . Randy Highsmith , the prosecutor , was standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she use this ? " he asked . Betsy took the glass and handed it to her client . Highsmith waited a moment while Andrea regained her composure . " Mrs. Hammermill , " he said , " I want you to know that I prosecuted you because I believe you took the law into your own hands . But I also want you to know that I do n't think your husband had the right to treat you the way he did . I do n't care who he was . If you had come to me , instead of shooting him , I would have done my best to put him in jail . I hope you can put this behind you and go on with your life . You seem like a good person . " Betsy wanted to thank Highsmith for his kind words , but she was too choked up to speak . As Andrea 's friends and supporters started to crowd around her Betsy pushed away from the throng to get some air .
