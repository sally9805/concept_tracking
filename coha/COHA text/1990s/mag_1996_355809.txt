Here 's a short , gritty novel whose elegant construction calls to mind the way Greg Louganis used to dive and Larry Bird and Kevin McHale used to work the back-door play . " Yes ! " the amazed onlooker would realize , watching these masters . " That 's how it 's done ! " Madison Smartt Bell 's Ten Indians ( Pantheon ; 272 pages ; $23 ) catches child psychiatrist Mike Devlin just short of burnout , mortally sick from seeing damaged children . He is no longer surprised , for instance , to notice an eight-year-old boy who has come to him with cigarette burns on his body scissoring the crotches from plastic soldiers . Nothing new , but " Devlin realized with a dreary fatigue , " the author writes , " that he would be obliged to discover the reason for this detail . " <P> Hoping to dodge his devils , Devlin pursues a second skill . He is a Tae Kwon Do adept , and though he is white , middle aged and middle class , he opens a gym @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghetto . This is both inspiration and folly , redoubled because he encourages his 17-year-old daughter , who also knows Tae Kwon Do , to help out . The neighborhood 's young black drug dealers are pragmatists , eager to learn the fighting discipline for self-protection when they are sent to prison . Devlin , an idealist trying shakily not to unravel , commits too much of himself . And despite his efforts , gunfire sweeps through the streets . People die . <P> The working out , told partly from Devlin 's viewpoint and partly , in convincing street language , from that of the drug dealers and their women , is spare and cinematic . Devlin , far out on a lonely voyage , saves his honor . Saves his daughter too . But it is the neighborhood that wins . Good ending , good novel . The author 's most recent book before Ten Indians was All Souls Rising , a panoramic , 530-page historical novel about Haiti 's slave rebellion in the 1790s . A lot of readers of the new novel who never read Bell before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and paperback shelves . <P>  --  By John Skow
