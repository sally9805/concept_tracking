Having a mean , stupid boss is part of the fun of working . It 's what bonds you to your fellow employees , even your fellow Americans . Who wants to be the guy at the bar who pipes up with " Actually , my boss brings me a bear claw and a mochachino every morning " ? <P> In the days of real industrial titans like Henry Clay Frick , recalcitrant employees could simply be killed , as they were by Frick 's actions during the Homestead strike . Or spied on in their homes , as they were by Henry Ford . What good is having power if you ca n't abuse it ? <P> But by the middle of the century , bosses had to be more clever , if not more subtle . Armand Hammer , whose business career lasted nearly the entire century , required many on Occidental Petroleum 's board of directors  --  most of whom were employees  --  to give him signed , undated resignation letters that he could use if they tried to vote against him . His closest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mouseketeers  --  with official membership drawings of a cowering mouse on a red carpet . But they were n't as beaten as the ITT execs of the 1960s and ' 70s , who were regularly grilled and even sickened in large meetings with CEO Harold Geneen . <P> By the ' 80s , the imperious CEO began to pride himself on scaring his employees . When Dick Snyder was president of Simon &; Schuster , ear protection became a recommended piece of executive equipment . The intensity of Snyder 's verbal assaults would surprise even him  --  but surprise did not stop him . Snyder met his match in the equally fearsome Martin Davis , who became CEO of Simon &; Schuster 's parent company , Gulf + Western . Meanwhile in the Bronx , Yankee owner George Steinbrenner was taking delight in firing people . He is so paradigmatic of impetuous power ( throwing tantrums , bad-mouthing employees in the press , hiring a spy to dig up dirt on Dave Winfield ) that he 's simply called the Boss  --  and not in a hip , Bruce Springsteen way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power tool who can shred humanity like an old memo to " create value . " GE 's Jack Welch , soon after becoming CEO , earned the label " Neutron Jack " for closing plants and laying off workers . He 's a prince compared to " Chainsaw " Al Dunlap . A West Point graduate and former paratrooper , Dunlap struck like Sherman and crowed about it . At Lily Tulip he fired 50% of the corporate office ; at Crown-Zellerbach , 20% of the work force ; at Scott Paper , 11,000 employees . After firing 6,000 at Sunbeam , Chainsaw himself got axed by a pair of fire-breathing shareholders : Ronald Perelman , never mistaken for Mr. Congeniality , and Michael Price , a.k.a. the " scariest s.o.b . on Wall Street "  --  at least to CEOs . <P> Few of the candidates for cruel bosses were women , mostly because so few bosses are women . But Leona Helmsley , the Queen of Mean , played evil stepmom to all the employees of her husband , New York City real estate mogul Harry Helmsley . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an apple from the kitchen while working through lunch ) and had that rich-person disease of being paranoid that everyone was stealing from her ; meanwhile , she was convicted of tax evasion . Even one of her lawyers called her a " tough bitch . "
