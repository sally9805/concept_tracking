What psychology and anthropology have described as nonordinary or altered states of consciousness are quite naturally rich in symbolic imagery . Indeed , the purpose of deliberately entering into altered states is often to seek the unusual information that such images hold , particularly when healing or solutions to problems are sought . Based upon artifact , art , and other records of human activity , healing rituals were , essentially , culturally relevant activities with careful and empirically derived methods of evoking the intuitive , invisible , and/or divine knowledge that was readily accessed in nonordinary states of mind . Thus , the symbolic material emerging from the conditions of the ceremony and manifested through visions and dreams has been the predominant and most frequently used " medicine " for both diagnosis and cure of physical disease in human history ( Grossinger 1980 ) . <p> Ancient forms of healing that involve the symbolic ( as Western approaches would say ) are found in virtually all religious traditions : in the ubiquitous practice of shamanism , in alchemy and other esoteric and metaphysical practices , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as psychosynthesis , Gestalt , hypnosis , and the " Active Imagination " techniques derived from Carl Jung 's work . My own research and clinical work in guided imagery with persons in life-threatening crises are the sources for many of the observations in this article ( Achterberg 1985 ; Achterberg , Dossey , and Kolkmeier 1994 ) . <p> The practice of medicine , itself , is replete with image and symbol . Although these are not explicitly used for diagnosis and cure , we must question to what degree patients are actually made well by being in the presence of modern healing symbols ( white coats , diplomas , thick books , unusual sights , sounds , and smells , and other representations of medicine ) and the nonordinary state of consciousness associated with being ill and in a hospital ( Helman 1992 ) . <p> Why are symbols so important to the healing process ? Where do the symbols come from ? What do they mean ? The answers to these questions are far beyond the scope of current knowledge . Yet , if we are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the role of imagination in both health and disease , it behooves us to begin to develop an ontology , or at least a taxonomy , of healing symbols . <p> First of all , I define image as simply a reproduction of a form , and symbol as an image that has been given meaning . For example , the retina receives and begins processing a visually transmitted form or image . Very quickly , the signal , " a constellation of physical signs , " is interpreted or given meaning by the unique characteristics of the receiving organism ( Rugg 1963 , 103 ) . In short , the image naturally and quickly is transformed into a symbol . In the context of healing , the words image and symbol are often used interchangeably . The process of imagery , or guided imagery , can be defined as thought using all the senses when images are internally rather than externally generated . The use of the term visualization is often confusing and will be avoided unless the imagery is exclusively visual . Many indigenous cultures would see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> What Is the Mechanism through which Symbols Diagnose and Heal ? <p> At least three levels of description can be used to help understand the long and persistent use of symbolic or imagery healing : biological , psychological , and transpersonal , briefly described below . <p> Biological Bases <p> The image , or imagery function , appears to have an intimate and primal association to the physical body , as evidenced by neuronal and biochemical studies . Direct neural connections ( the brain 's hardwiring ) have been identified that link areas of the brain that process the image to other areas of the brain involved in emotion , and also to areas of the body involved in immunity , such as the thymus . Additional connections between image function and the entire body are possible , given the relatively new findings on the ability of certain transmitter substances , including the neuropeptides , to serve as wandering messengers capable of carrying information throughout the bodymind . <p> The image can be conceived of as a bridge , or transformational zone , between functions of mind and body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vice versa . Images that evoke an emotional response ( fear , anger , anxiety , depression , calm , elation , and so forth ) are accompanied by corresponding physical changes . The reverse is also true , in that significant biological changes ( hormonal in particular ) can evoke emotional shifts , as well as the imagery appropriate to such emotions . <p> Biologically based imagery ( i.e. , images that are representative of actual body functions ) have been shown to correlate with numerous components of the immune system , including secretary IgA , T-cells , and neutrophils ( Achterberg 1985 ; Rider and Achterberg 1989 ; Rider and Achterberg 1990 ) . Additional studies of guided imagery and hypnosis show significant changes in insulin levels , oxygen supply in tissues , cardiovascular system , skin temperature , allergic reactions , wart removal , and many other variables ( Rossi 1986 ) . <p> Psychological Bases <p> The symbol serves as a link between the known and the unknown and between the inner mysterious worlds of experience and the conscious expression of those experiences . As such , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of meaning . Giving meaning to a life crisis is , in itself , a healing ( or " making whole " ) function , as the crisis is rewoven back into the fabric and flow of a person 's life . Michael and Nancy Samuels , authors of Seeing with the Mind 's Eye ( 1975 ) write : " When people become aware of a symbol as an image , they become whole ; they see , if only for a moment , the great scheme of things , the unity of the universe and their place in it . And they see that unity in terms of concrete images from the world around them  --  the only things that are ' seeable '  --  but they see these concrete images in a novel , nonordinary light " ( 82 ) . <p> In my experience , the story associated with the symptoms of disease , or the metaphor derived from the biological nature of the problem , is often the story of a person 's life in the larger sense . For example , a woman with severe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also developing adhesions and scar tissue from surgery , symbolized her body as a fortress with all of its resources being channeled into protection . With this symbol came the awareness that as a New Yorker , she had learned to be feisty and over-guarded , even unnecessarily aggressive , to the extent that her social life was sadly affected by her interpersonal style . Thus , the symbols emanating from the cellular microcosm may shed meaning on the macrocosm of personal engagement ( and vice versa ) . <p> Carl Jung ( 1968 ) referred to the symbol as a psychological mechanism that transforms energy , stating that " The place or the medium of realization is neither mind nor matter , but that intermediate realm of subtle reality which can be adequately expressed only by the symbol . The symbol is neither rational nor irrational , neither real nor unreal , it is always both " ( 102 ) . <p> Transpersonal Bases <p> The utility of symbolic work in healing is most often associated with the transpersonal or spiritual dimensions . The symbol is viewed as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the greater , or more cosmic , world of a spiritual nature . The iconography , relics , mandalas , and sacraments of spiritual traditions all symbolize or represent what can not be seen or known through the ordinary senses . <p> In ancient or tribal belief systems , an image or symbol is not merely a representation of the spirit but actually is the spirit . Therefore , the use of the word symbol is somewhat of a misnomer when reference is made to these belief systems . The painting of a bear is the bear . Even in the popular mind of Christianity ( if not in doctrine ) , the bone of a saint contained the essence of the saint . The healing power of symbols , then , was the same as the divine because symbols were the divine . And , too , the practices of prayer , meditation , ceremonial dances , shamanic drumming , fasting , chant , song , and visionary art call forth the experience of the spirit through symbolic forces . <p> It is with all three levels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transpersonal  --  that the symbol serves as a bridge to knowledge , wisdom , and healing . <p> Where Do the Symbols Come from , and What Do They Mean ? <p> In the following pages , symbols will be categorized by various observations and interpretations but with the admonition that all analytical attempts obviate the reality that for any given individual , symbols emerge from a number of complex sources and have idiosyncratic meaning . <p> Nevertheless , I believe it is important to begin a serious and systematic study of images and symbols and their origin , potential meaning , and impact on healing because of the large number of people who are using guided imagery for their health . In a recent article in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine ( 1993 ) , Dr. David Eisenberg and his colleagues at Harvard surveyed 1,539 adults to determine the prevalence and patterns of use of unconventional or alternative medicine in the United States . One in three respondents reported they had used unconventional resources in the past year , and guided imagery was the fourth most frequently used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it , too , usually draws on imagery and symbol . <p> The current interest in ritual , myth , and multicultural use of symbolic healing is an additional reason to took more deeply into the nature of imaginal system . Glib interpretations of symbols and the putation of universal meaning based on a limited sample of cultures may not serve to benefit the person who is seeking knowledge and healing . On the other hand , a broad knowledge of the way symbolic healing is used world wide , as well as a sensitive understanding of a person 's personal interpretation , will lend strength to the therapeutic encounter . Angeles Arden 's ( 1993 ) splendid work , which extrapolates ancient and enduring symbolism to modern issues , is a case in point . <p> The category levels presented below are not intended to be particularly linear or hierarchal but rather move from the material , visible , and quantifiable to the spiritual , mystical , or transpersonal domains ; nor are the categories intended to be all inclusive but rather a useful starting point to stimulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no attempt is made to reduce the phenomenon of symbolic healing to the biological level ( an accusation often made of any attempt to describe what is going on in the brain during altered states ) but rather to describe brain functions that may be corollary to emotional or mystical states of consciousness . <p> Categories of Symbols <p> Brain Neurochemical Function <p> The higher or cortical functions of the brain transform image to symbol by virtue of an overlay of meaning . In addition , the brain may also have the innate ability to recognize and respond to certain images , which may account for the universal , or near-universal , presence ( but not necessarily the universal meaning ) of some symbols . This conclusion is derived , in part , from the study of imagery associated with psychedelic substances , such as LSD , psilocybin , and mescaline . Several researchers , including Heinrich Kluver , a University of Chicago scientist working in the 1920s , who found that the visions reported during the use of psychedelics can be categorized into four basic areas : ( 1 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lattice/honeycombs , and ( 4 ) funnels ( Hooper and Teresi 1986 ; Siegel 1977 ) . Similar images occur during near-death experiences , epileptic seizures , and hyperventilation . <p> It is theorized that an over-excited brain , an unstable brain , or a brain deprived of sensory stimulation , as well as one exposed to psychedelic chemicals , may result in an increase in the neurotransmitter norepinephrine and a decrease or inhibition of serotonin . Under these circumstances , which are also associated with non-drug altered states , images appear . What they symbolize , of course , depends on the life experience and the set and setting of the person involved in the visioning . <p> August Reader , a neuro-opthalamist , speculates that when the human brain is significantly deprived of oxygen , such as in instances of near-drowning or interruption of the major blood supply to the cortex , the relatively large nucleus pigmentosus pontis ( locus ceruleus ) in the hindbrain is activated ( Reader 1993 ) . This area manufactures norepinephrine and wakes up the rest of the brain when something exciting or threatening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review , where all events , people , and places in one 's life are seen as a meaningful and interconnected web . For most individuals , this experience is one of deep spiritual significance , and life is seen as having meaning and purpose . In addition , the web may be a survival response , in that the brain immediately flashes on all previous experience in order to find a potential life-saving solution . <p> Other investigators , particularly the noted scientist Wilder Penfield ( 1958 ) , observed that stimulation of the Sylvian fissure of the right temporal lobe results in the classic imagery of the near-death experience and perhaps even of archetypal figures . ( Mystical experiences , generally , have been associated with electrical discharge of the temporal lobes . ) <p> From animal research of the visual system , we know that primates , as well as other animals , have certain preprogrammed " engrams , " or areas in the brain that respond to images relevant to the environment of the species . This work is well known and highly regarded in the fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have moving bug detector systems preprogrammed in their brains , and newly hatched chicks have hawk-like form detectors . Monkeys appear to have hand detectors , and very young human infants respond with a smile to face-like images , as long as these images have features that are placed in the position of two eyes and a nose and have an unwrinkled forehead . Interestingly , the mouth is not required to elicit what appears to be a universal response , and , therefore , the smile can not be assumed to be imitative behavior ( Spitz and Wolf 1946 ) . Joseph Campbell ( 1976 ) uses this last example , mouthless primitive art , to marshal evidence for what he thought might be an instinctual or innate basis for recurrent myth and symbol . <p> Experimentation on human brains is difficult , of course , so one can only guess what images are stored for survival and growth purposes . In the section on transpersonal domains discussed below , I expand these ideas beyond the relatively simple but dependable imagery associated with an " unstable " brain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the symbols associated with healing are drawn from the natural environment . Thus , in areas where natural springs or wells are found , healing significance is attached to those symbols , as well as to mountains , lakes , or other features of the landscape . Animals that are plentiful or that hold special significance for survival usually form the totems or fetishes for the community . Animals such as deer , which serve as both food and clothing , often do triple duty as symbols of healing , and logically so . It might be assumed that it is the common environment of the planet , with its elements of earth , air , water , and fire , its weather , its heavenly bodies  --  all vital for sustaining life  --  that can account for much of the adoption of common symbols and their association with the gods . These symbols are imbued with the meaning derived from their appearance : the rainbow at the end of a rain , the power of the lightning flash , the promise of the sun as the days lengthen and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysterious belly of the earth and brings forth the water necessary for the sustenance of life . <p> In less complex times , the interpretation of these symbols , as well as their emergence , was much more predictable . Now , we derive our natural symbols from zoos , from the media , and from a panoramic view of the earth and sky . Yet , when they appear in the context of healing , perhaps the elements , the animals , the places still carry with them a message or teaching implicit in their very nature  --  the vision of the eagle , the fleetness and grace of a jaguar , the pack-like or community behavior of the wolf , the wiles of the coyote . <p> Culture <p> Many symbols are culture-bound and depend upon the cosmology of the culture for their appearance . Others , such as the circle , some form of the cross , the sun , and the divine forms of masculine and feminine , appear to be universal but still depend upon the culture for meaning . The owl , for instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with mystery , symbolizes death in some Native American groups and wisdom in European folklore . The Esselen Indians of California , however , believed that the appearance of an owl was a visit from an ancestral spirit . <p> Groups of people who have a relatively homogeneous life style and surroundings appear to use only a few symbols in healing . Janet Siskind ( 1973 ) , an anthropologist who specializes in lowland South American cultures , describes the healing-symbol system of the Sharanahua Indians . The person who seeks healing is asked by the shaman to relate a dream image . Then , " the shaman takes from the dream the symbols that seem most meaningful and creates in the shori ( a hallucinogen ) vision a fuller expression of the symbol he has selected " ( 140 ) . The cure is then wrought by singing a curing about the relevant symbols , which may be animals , fish , people , rivers , and other objects within the given community 's awareness . Even though the symbols are rich in contextual meaning and the interpretations may overlap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure . Siskind points out that a patient who dreams of a bead necklace after cutting himself would not be communicating appropriately because bead necklaces represent the curing of other types of symptoms , especially the grippe . Radios and outboard motors are also used as symbols for healing various diseases among the Sharanahua , as well as in other Amazon tribes . ( One has only to spend a short time in the Amazon to appreciate the vital importance of the radio and the motorboat for the survival and well-being of these people . ) Siskind also notes that most shamans are quite successful in the cures they attempt in this symbolic fashion . Native peoples would speak of this type . of curing in terms of the invocation of spirits rather than symbolic healing . <p> Two observations relevant to modern culture are significant . The first is that in imagery work , many people adopt symbols that have great technological or scientific power , just as the Sharanahua incorporate familiar machines into their imagery . In the United States and other countries where science is an overarching metaphor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the molecular level to express and to communicate with their inner healing resources and , in many instances , are able to regulate their physiology with these images ( Achterberg 1985 ; Achterberg , Dossey , and Kolkmeier 1994 ) . <p> Second , the physician and his/her accompanying technology are healing symbols in the cultural metaphor , and these are incorporated into the imagery . One example is a cancer patient 's use of the image of doctors with little black bags to symbolize her immune phagocytes , or scavengers . During her imagery , she imagined the doctors moving rapidly through her body , gathering up all cancer cells and putting them in their bags and disposing of them through her natural elimination process . Other culturally relevant and powerful healing images are laser guns , vacuum cleaners , fire hoses , and , you name it , it has probably been used . <p> Other symbols associated with modem health care are what anthropologists call " multivocal , " or having multiple and far-reaching meaning and influence ( Helman 1992 ) . The typical multivocal symbol is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in some form , by most health care professionals . It symbolizes cleanliness , purity , wisdom , power , knowledge , healing , and authority , to mention just a few characteristics . And anyone who wears the white coat , including the admissions clerk and the medical librarian , assumes some of the power of the symbol . <p> I was told an interesting story about the power of this symbol by a young physician who was traveling in North Africa . Once , in the middle of what he considered to be wild and uncivilized territory , he injured his knee . His companions insisted on taking him immediately to a woman in a neighboring village who was well known for her ability to cure . She listened to his complaint and then departed , returning shortly garbed in a white silk nurse 's uniform , which must have been left there in the early part of the century by a British nurse . The strangeness of the garment aside , her treatment of heat and massage was precisely what was needed . <p> Some institutions or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which destroys their healing significance for generations , if not for thousands of years . The snake , a symbol of healing and particularly of the feminine role in healing , was revered in the pre-Christian cultures of the Western world . Statues of female deities called by many names , including Innana , Isis , Gula , and Nerthus , holding their sacred snakes , have been found in Greece , Rome , Northern Europe and the countries of the Near East . In the Judeo-Christian tradition , however , the extraordinary power of the snake was recast in the shadow of evil but with no less power to penetrate the human psyche . It is only in recollecting history in recent years , particularly under the influence of feminist historians , anthropologists , and archaeologists , that the snake as healing symbol is enjoying a cultural rebirth . <p> The most challenging work that I do is with symbolic healing in Germany , where there is an understandably vast mistrust of symbol and myth . It is not a unique observation , but a relevant one , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the contrived manipulation of the deep-seated mythical traditions of that country . Thus , the Germans , even those a generation removed from the years of Hitler , approach symbolic healing work with great temerity and awe , and they provide a living example of symbolism turned destructive and burned deeply in the psyche . <p> Personal History <p> Sandwiched between the obvious physical and social influences on the symbol and the transpersonal is the personal history of the individual , which allows for the interpretation or reading of a symbol to be as unique as a thumb print . It is within the personal framework that all symbolic categories do indeed collapse , and the symbols are infused with meaning . For the therapist or healer who uses symbolic healing as a modality , the personal aspect presents the richest challenge of the work and requires holding silence until the personal story is told . <p> Many years ago , while my husband , Dr. Frank Lawlis , and I were on the faculty at a medical school and were at the beginning of our work with imagery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a vast readership hungry for sensational items and celebrity gossip ) disguised his position in order to get an interview with us on research we had published on the effectiveness of imagery with arthritis ( Achterberg and Lawlis 1980 ) . Except for the headline " New Cure for Arthritis , " the article was quite factual and nonsensational . What was shocking was the number of letters we received from arthritis sufferers around the country in which they asked for a prescription for a simple symbol to get rid of their arthritis . Unfortunately , symbolic healing is far from simple . <p> A complex example of someone who drew symbols from his personal history and cultural and mythic symbolism is a man I will call Roger , who is alive and well albeit with a diagnosis of a type of cancer called multiple myeloma . In his imagery , to his great distress , the cancerous cells were envisioned as large , aggressive , angry women . His healing symbol invoked during daily imagery sessions was a hairy , wild man named Brute , who lived at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to release the anger from women was to hold them tightly until it dissolved . The larger story was that Roger had spent most of his life , as had his father before him , in deflecting and absorbing , rather than dissolving , women 's anger . What he longed for was the initiation into manhood , the rite of passage that allowed him to move into functional autonomy and individuation and away from the role that had drained so much of his life 's energy . So , we see the macrocosm again reflected in the imagery of life-threatening disease . And we see the multiple influences on symbol formation , including the influence of ancient mythology , the actual dynamics of physical disease , and personal experience and recognize the significant role of Robert Bly and others in the so-called men 's movement in identifying the great yearning and emptiness in men that comes from the lack of presence of the sacred masculine . During ritual healing ceremonies , Roger underwent a rebirth and initiatory process . In therapy , he and his wife learned new ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mild form of chemotherapy . Synchronistically for one or all of these reasons , his disease went into remission and he has remained healthy for two years . <p> The Transpersonal Domains <p> In describing the probable source of images or symbols , the above descriptions are parsimonious and relatively verifiable . However , when images are invoked or appear in the course of healing , they are often so improbable , unusual , or fantastic that additional sources beyond the self must be considered . For example , a woman friend of mine , whom I will call Jane , recently told me the following story : <p> Several years ago , she was a guest at Rancho la Puerto , a fitness center situated in Baja , Mexico , at the base of Mount Kuchumaa near the border town of Tecate . The mountain was named for a great shaman who saw the future as he stood on the summit . The mountain is still used by local tribes for vision quests and other shamanic work . The fitness center , one of the oldest in the country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful building in full view of the mountain . As Jane participated in the session , she focused on several problems in her life , including a desired career change and the feeling that she was confined by insurmountable boundaries and barriers . Spontaneously , she had the vision of a structure with undulating or wavy walls . A bird flew out of a spiral in the center . Grateful and astonished at the message  --  her imagined walls were really movable , and she was free  --  she sketched the vision , dated the drawing , and went home and made major life changes . <p> Six months later , she returned to the ranch and at the base of the mountain , the sculptures in her vision had actually materialized . During her absence , architect James Hubbel and Milenko Matanovic , a musician and poet , had conducted a workshop called " Soil and Soul . " For nine days , they and thirteen " apprentices " sought a vision from the land to honor the mountain for the ranch 's fiftieth birthday . <p> The monument was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evoked from the land itself , and grown organically from rock and brick made on site . The group slept in the garden below the mountain , walked across the meadows and hills , listened to the stories of the townspeople and the owners of the ranch , and then each sketched their ideas . On the fifth day , construction of the composite vision began , with every grout line tooled by hand with sticks found in the leaves . The final monument , with its wavy walls and a central piece with its spiral directed into the center of the Earth , is virtually identical to Jane 's vision . <p> I am quite familiar with the ranch and this particular monument and have always found it beautiful but strange because it bears no resemblance to the typical Mexican architecture of the area . In fact , the story goes that several of the Mexican workers refused to help set the stone because the patterns were so antagonistic to the carefully laid and plumbed rock work to which they had become accustomed . <p> The odds of having this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say the least . So how did it happen ? None of the possible answers fits the current model of how information is gained and transmitted . All parties ( including my friend ) believed the images came from the land itself , which is formed there by violent belchings from the Earth 's core and characterized by rock outcroppings with wavy quartz veins . <p> Below , I will further discuss these puzzling types of visionary experiences that appear to relate to the transpersonal realm , with the caveat that this material is highly speculative , controversial , and therefore quite interesting , <p> Collections of Thought <p> Significant evidence from parapsychological research supports the notion that thoughts , dreams , and visions can be communicated to others at a distance , or nonlocally . Furthermore , there does not appear to be an adherence to linear time ; that is , the image may be received before it is " sent " in real time . William Braud and Marilyn Schlitz ( 1989 ) and colleagues have reported on some of the finest work in support of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with anxiety and relaxation , when sent to individuals in another room , were found to correlate with changes in the receivers ' physiologies . <p> The field has been recently analyzed by Radin and Nelson ( 1989 ) and Radin and Ferrari ( 1991 ) , who conclude that the research in this area is characterized by rigor and an unusual number of well-controlled studies . The opinion of Brian Josephson ( 1991 ) , Nobel Prizewinning physicist , and others is that in the long run , these phenomena related to the transmission of thought will be accepted and confirmed by science . <p> The transpersonal transmission and reception of images is more likely during altered states of consciousness , and for good reason . During ordinary states of consciousness , survival would be seriously hampered if we were bombarded with images that did not relate to the reality at hand . During altered states , such as those induced by the accouterments of ritual ( fasting , repetitive sounds and movements , sensory deprivation , etc. ) , the filters are apparently more permeable , or , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted on ceremonial occasions . When laboratory studies fail to confirm the effect of nonlocal , or transpersonal , communication , it may well be because the researchers make no attempt to ensure an altered state of consciousness . <p> The collected thought version of transpersonal images does not require a spiritual foundation . Rather , it rests on the supposition that there is a data bank of sorts , created by consciousness , or by people thinking , and material is occasionally available in the form of image or symbol . The data bank is dependent on human input and grows larger as life goes on . <p> The mechanism of transmission is no doubt complex and involves methods of energy exchange that are currently unknown . On the other hand , images may not only be extrasensory but sensory , as well . The sense of smell , or reception and interpretation of airborne molecules , is a likely candidate for transmission of images from the thoughts of others who are in close proximity . In several studies , smells have been shown to evoke emotions , and rightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the brain ) was a " smell detector " during the course of human evolution . In one study , Owen and Lawlis ( 1981 ) instructed women to image scenes that evoked either relaxation , anxiety , or sensuality . During the imagery , they held a cotton pad under their arms . The cotton was then sealed in a test tube , and a group of men were instructed to open the tubes , sniff , and report their images . There was a significant correspondence for the relaxation images but not for the other two . This intriguing work suggests a very basic mechanism for what often are puzzling human interactions . <p> Alternate Realities <p> The collected thought description of image reception is significantly different from Carl Jung 's ideas of collective consciousness , particularly as his ideas matured . Jung held initially that there were forms of ideas available to humanity that spring from their biological makeup . The analogy is , perhaps , the neurological engram ( described earlier ) and the innate stimulus detectors . In Jung 's system , however , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifestation over time and in various cultures . Unlike the the personal unconscious , the contents of the collective unconscious were not buried elements of personal experience but rather owed their existence to heredity ( 1936/1937 ) . Later , he believed that the images were autonomous , produced themselves , and had their own life : " . . . their autonomy is a most uncomfortable thing to reconcile oneself to , and yet the very fact that the unconscious presents itself in that way gives us the best means of handling it " ( 1963,177 ) . <p> The archetypes people a mythic reality and serve as universal governing principles , according to Jung . In altered states of consciousness , the figures take on their life and presence , and in deeply altered states , one may actually experience being the image itself . The universal images are the mother and father archetypes , the wise old man or woman , the divine child , and so forth . The stories they live out are the familiar multicultural themes of death and rebirth , separation and unity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the forces of darkness and light , the sacred marriage of the masculine and feminine . <p> Stanislaus Grof , after guiding thousands of people through altered states with holotropic breathwork and psychedelics , believes firmly that we have access to all mythic realities , including those described at other times and by other cultures ( 1992 ) . He describes , for example , American and European women who become the Hindu goddess Kali , taking on her typical facial expressions even though they had no knowledge of this figure . He thus compares the collective unconscious to a transmitting station that constantly broadcasts every bit of material ever produced on radio or television . <p> Grof ( 1992 ) also notes that people in altered or transpersonal states of consciousness are able to envision sacred symbols from spiritual traditions of which they have no intellectual knowledge and even decipher their esoteric meaning , which " strongly suggests that these are not logos designed by humans for religious purposes but are elements of a symbolic language belonging to the collective unconscious " ( 163 ) . <p> I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a life-threatening disease . A woman I will call Julie was struggling with a chronic lung disorder , and she sought help with her images for healing . Working with her was a remarkable experience because she could vividly engage in multiple realities , and during guided imagery she would interact with me so that I , too , could witness her visionary landscapes . During a rather complicated imagery session , she described in detail a woman in a full-length , jewel-encrusted gown , handing her what appeared to be a geometric form . Julie later drew the woman and cut a geometric form out of paper and folded it so that she could understand its three-dimensional shape . The symbol touched her deeply , and she felt she had been given a true gift of healing . In a book on the history of fashion , we identified the woman 's dress and headdress as about late sixteenth-century England . After much searching in books on symbols , the geometric piece was identified as a dragoh 's eye  --  a magical source of healing used at about the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I have noted above the extensive cultural overlay in the mythic and symbolic realms . The question , then , is whether or what symbolic material is " raw " and how much is " cooked " by personal orientation ? The idea that some forms are indeed primary is an ancient Platonic idea . According to Tarnas 's ( 1992 ) excellent discussion of this material , " it is crucial to the Platonic understanding that these Forms are primary , while the visible objects of conventional reality are their direct derivatives . . . they possess a quality of being , a degree of reality , that is superior to that of the concrete world " ( 6 ) . <p> The forms provided governing principles for life and an order to seemingly chaotic existence . Adolf Bastian ( 1868 ) , from whom Jung drew in the development of the concept of the archetypes , identified common threads among all cultures , calling these " elementary ideas , " or universal ideas , which were cloaked in local garbs but which nevertheless were recognizable and had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The esoteric science of alchemy sought to discover elementary symbols by searching the unconscious " without a program , " as Marie-Louise von Franz ( 1980 ) mentions . Having the immediate experience of unconscious symbolic material is a very different phenomenon than adopting the symbols of a religious or cultural tradition . These symbols , although originally presenting as pure or elementary material , are worked over and through and are reformed by the collective , so that they carry a unique imprimatur . Von Franz tells an interesting story of St. Niklaus von der Flue , who had a vision of a divine wanderer wearing a shining bear skin and singing a three-word song . Clearly , he felt either God or Christ was approaching him with a message . The original report of the incident was lost , and subsequent biographers told the story omitting the bearskin , no doubt because that detail did not fit with Christian symbology . The original report was recovered a few years ago , and it demonstrates clearly that the lived experience of what may be pure form is distorted through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary images , the realities they inhabit , and the stories they tell are guides for the evolution of human consciousness . It is as if the story of all life is already written . The healing comes in giving meaning to the personal story by placing one 's life within the larger , more cosmic context . <p> The Importance of Ritual for Evoking Healing Images <p> Most cultures have a sanctioned ritual form for entering into altered states of consciousness with the purpose of engaging in the life of the symbolic realm . The ceremonies provide road maps for moving into , through , and out of mysterious , difficult , awesome places and for interpreting the experiences therein . Without sanctioned community support , the experiences may feel like madness , and , indeed , are often diagnosed medically as such . <p> Sometimes the healer goes alone into the visionary experience , as in traditional shamanism , but at other times both healer and the person seeking the healing share the journey . Living traditions such as the Navajo use the rituals of chant and sand paintings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recreate a mythic world in order to restore harmony to the individual whose life or soul is at risk . The person being healed is advised to enter the visionary world also , and occasionally to sit near or on the various sacred symbols in the paintings in order to absorb their power . <p> Similarly , during the Kalachakra ceremonies in India , where sandpaintings are also used to enter mythic realities , the initiates are guided by the Dalai Lama to enter into the landscape of the sand mandala , to visualize the various 722 deities , and literally build a palace with the imagination . It is thus that major cultural restoration or balance is restored ( Mascarin 1993 ) . <p> Some traditions , of course , use plant medicines to aid visions . The medicine people , shamans , or paye in the tribes of the Amazonia , currently well described by ethnobiologists Schultes and Raffauf ( 1992 ) , use various preparations of the Banisteriopsis vine to enter into mythic realities for the purposes of knowledge and healing . Usually , apprentices to the tradition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the visions are thereby ordered into culturally meaningful symbols and events ( Langdon 1992 ) . A very experienced shaman can travel to the house of God , where he is shown a book with all possible medicines available for curing . ( The masculine pronoun is used here because women do not normally practice this type of symbolic healing , probably because the plant may cause uterine contractions and , therefore , may negatively influence reproductive function . ) <p> The Greek Asclepian physicians , a direct feed into modern medicine , developed " incubation sleep " temples for healing serious disorders that did not remit even with fairly advanced medical practices . Patients fasted and went into a near-sleep or trance state , and then visions of healing were revealed to them by the Greek demigods of healing , with appropriate symbolism . The frequent description of yellow snakes " licking the eyelids " of patients and being kept and treasured by the healers indicates that the Greeks , too , may have used snake venom ( a hallucinogen ) to produce visions . These temples were found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away as England . Later , the symbols and the visions were notably modified by Christianity but the essential ritual of bringing the sick into a holy place and inducing an altered state of consciousness , where beloved figures appeared and were engaged in healing through the use of symbols , remains unchanged . <p> Use of the symbol to represent what can not be seen but is so deeply felt is the most basic of all medicines , the source of all art , and is endemic to all spiritual traditions . The most meaningful and useful symbols are evoked in rituals and in social contexts where their expression is supported and interpreted . The activities of healing rituals invariably create nonordinary states of consciousness , and out of these states emerge the images and their symbolic overlay that fosters the wisdom , growth , beauty , and evolution of humankind . <p>
