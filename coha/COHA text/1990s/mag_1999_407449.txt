California Venturers learn to track elusive targets : lost humans . // ON THE EDGE ... Rob Wedge , 17 , adjusts his seat harness , checks the tension on the safety line and lowering line , and clicks on the radio button . " Safety line ready ? " Rob asks loudly . " Safety line ready ! " comes the immediate response . " Lowering line ready ? " " Lowering line ready ! " " Rescuer ready ? " " Rescuer ready ! " " Lower away slowly ! " Rob looks over the vertical edge at his feet to his destination 80 feet below him . He leans back into empty space until he is almost horizontal , his feet pushing hard against the rock face . There is a sudden jerk on the line , and his heart , like his body , drops for a terrifying second . " Gently , guys , " he says . Even though he is attached to two lines that will more than hold his weight , he still is nervous . He looks down one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hills of northern California . Within four minutes , he is close to the victim . Moments later , Rob is on the ground , easing his way over to the victim . " Hey ! What took so long ? I could have treated myself ! " the victim says , beginning to laugh . The " victim " is not really hurt , and this is no life-threatening situation . It 's part of training for Venturing Crew 74 , based in Marin County , Calif. , just north of San Francisco . Rob and crew have come to a remote site where they can practice their high-angle rescue skills . Training for Trouble The crew is part of the all-volunteer , 60-member Marin County Sheriff 's Department Search and Rescue Team . About 30 SAR team members are Venturers ; the rest are adults .

For every hour spent looking for a lost hiker , there are many more of practice , classroom and special skills training . In 1997 , the team spent almost 9,000 hours on training , 3,500 hours on actual missions and more than 1,000 hours on other activities . Stuck on the Rock All the training paid off July 12 , 1997 . A few members of the team were in California 's Yosemite National Park performing volunteer work with local rangers . Little did they know they were about to go on the adventure of a lifetime . A climber was injured on the famous 3,500-foot El Capitan rock face and needed to be airlifted out of the area . Yosemite Search and Rescue knew it was shorthanded and called for help . " I was amazed when they called and asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freed says . " It was an incredible experience , looking straight  --  down from the top , 3,500 feet ! " Six Venturers had to rappel 650 feet down the sheer granite surface , then haul the victim back up . Night had fallen by the time they were finished , so the rescuers-and the victim , who had spent 36 hours on the ledge before the crew got there-had to stay on top of the mountain before reaching safety in the morning . Ready to Move As at Yosemite , the Venturers and the SAR team have to be ready at a moment 's notice . All members have pagers that alert them to an incident day or night . Rescues might involve thrashing through brush , forest and other wild terrain , up and down canyons and ravines . That 's what Daniel Knox , 16 , and Zac Zimmer , 17 , faced during one call . After a night of intensive searching for a missing man , it was Daniel and Zac-not one of the adult volunteers or members of other state and federal agencies on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been out searching all night long , and it was just before dawn , " Daniel recalls . " Then we heard a rustling in the bushes . " While Daniel bushwhacked through dense foliage to locate the 71-year-old man , Zac stayed on the road to mark the location . " The man was in late stages of hypothermia , " Daniel says . " He was soon out and on his way to the hospital . We were extremely fortunate to be in the right place at the right time , or things might have turned out differently for him . " Keeping People Safe Photograph Gear up and move out Adult leader Patrick McClymont , left , and Crew 74 head into the hills to search for a missing hiker in July 1998 It was one of 28 calls the crew fielded that year // Marin County is an ideal place for Venturing Crew 74 .

Thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fun on a daily basis . That means , at some point , someone is going to get into trouble . And that 's when the crew members fly into action . Daniel Knox has been with the team since 1995 and plans to join an adult SAR team when he leaves the crew to go to college . " When I can tell a worried family member that we have located the missing person , it is a feeling unparalleled by anything , " he says . To see their expressions means the world to me . DO N'T LEAVE HOME WITHOUT IT Although Search and Rescue team members love what they do , they 'd rather not have to do it . They would prefer hikers and outdoorsmen follow basic safety rules , like telling someone where they are going and when they 'll be back and carrying the Scout 's Outdoor Essentials .
