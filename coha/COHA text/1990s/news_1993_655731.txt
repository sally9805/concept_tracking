<p> IS home baking on the rise ? Judging from the flurry of mixing , kneading , and shaping at King Arthur Flour 's recent " Winterbake , " one might think so . <p> Tantalizing sweet , savory , and spice aromas wafted throughout kitchens , makeshift classrooms , and a maze of hallways at the Inn at Essex here . The Winterbake honors winners of a national baking contest sponsored by the flour 's parent company , Sands , Taylor &; Wood . It was initiated in 1990 as a biennial celebration of King Arthur Flour 's founding in 1790 . <p> But , even the 1,000 recipe submissions that landed in their mailbox in response to a publicized " search for a new classic " do n't necessarily point to a reversal in the cooling off of home baking . <p> " I 've heard it said that every generation spends half as much time in the kitchen as the previous generation , " says Josh Sosland , associate editor for Milling and Baking News , a weekly trade publication based in Kansas City , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baked goods has boosted per-capita consumption of flour from 110 lbs . in 1972 to 140 lbs . in 1992 . <p> But this is no consolation to King Arthur Flour owners Frank and Brinna Sands , a husband-and-wife team , who are concerned about the scant amount of flour that makes its way into the hands of home bakers . <p> " In 1900 , 80 percent of flour milled in America was for home baking . Today , it 's around 4 percent , " explains Mr. Sands in a Monitor interview . <p> Behind the facts and figures , however , the couple perceives the loss of a tradition that means far more than producing and consuming a loaf of bread or a sticky bun . <p> " So many of the things we do today are passive , " says Mr. Sands , pointing to television and other leisure activities as offering tough competition for baking . <p> Other reasons they cite for the drop in interest range from efforts of baking-mix companies that create an image of home baking as a tedious task to the increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the things we know is that even when the rest of the world seems like it 's falling apart , baking makes you feel so good because you have done something that is creative , and if you have someone to share it with , it creates another connection , " says Ms. Sands . She adds that by baking for her grandchildren with her grandmother 's recipes , she connects generations that will never meet . <p> The passing along of family traditions is a way of life for president Frank E. Sands II , who , after buying the company from his father in 1986 , became the fifth generation of his family in the business . <p> A major thrust of Winterbake is to enlighten the public about " the pure joy of baking , " to which the company is dedicated , as they tell consumers in a bannered slogan alongside the familiar knight-on-the-horse logo on every King Arthur Flour bag . <p> At the stately Colonial Inn at Essex , nestled into the Green Mountains in Vermont 's Lake Champlain region , the company gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and their guests , along with seven top chefs and culinary instructors - Albert Kumin , Jim Dodge , Mary Ann Esposito , Michael Jubinsky , Barbara Lauterbach , Elizabeth Alston , and Josef Harrewyn - for three days of workshops , sumptuous dining , and sampling of the winning recipes . <p> Of course , these folks hardly need convincing as to the benefits of baking from scratch . But , their leavening influence on the image of home baking and King Arthur Flour beyond the boundaries of the inn is highly valued . <p> " The instructors are n't paid anything , they come of their own goodwill because they care about the product , " says Mr. Sands . <p> Julia Child , who judged Winterbake entries last September , is among King Arthur Flour 's most prominent fans and " market makers , " as Mr. Sands calls them . <p> King Arthur Flour 's high-protein ( which , when mixed with yeast , converts to high-gluten ) , bleach- and chemical-free formula is its biggest draw among the company 's circle of market makers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monarch of bread-baking flours . <p> In addition to Winterbake , King Arthur Flour sponsors many other grass-roots ventures that spread the word about its baker-friendly formula and more importantly , to the Sands , instill a love of baking . <p> Michael Jubinsky , who is an instructor of bread-baking at Connecticut Culinary Institute as well as a King Arthur spokesman , has been involved in King Arthur 's latest program : teaching schoolchildren how to bake bread . <p> The first of three of these sessions was held in Killingly , Conn. for two assemblies of 450 7th and 8th graders each . <p> On stage , Mr. Jubinsky mixed , kneaded , and let rise dough for a loaf of " chewy hearth " bread . Afterward , the kids were given ingredients ( including King Arthur flour , of course ) , a recipe ( also King Arthur 's ) , and the homework assignment to return after the holiday weekend with a home-baked loaf to donate to a soup kitchen . <p> " It was such a gas , " he says , explaining that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toting fresh , golden loaves along with pens , paper , and textbooks . <p> Success at baking their own bread helps them to feel good about themselves , says Jubinsky . <p> Taking it one step further , he says it 's touching to see these kids , some who are underprivileged themselves , share their creation with those even less fortunate . <p> " I know it sounds corny , " he says , " but in sharing a fresh-baked loaf of bread , you 're giving a part of yourself ... it 's an act of love . " <p> Jubinsky is somewhat encouraged by the strong turnout in his regular baking classes , which he sees as indicative of a " getting back to basics " trend . <p> " In a declining economy , people want to take more control of their lives , " he says , explaining that baking one 's own bread is one result of this . <p> Getting back to basics has its modern-day shortcuts , however , and in many kitchens where loaf pans are collecting dust in an out-of-reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread machine see story at right , sits prominently atop the counter . <p> Despite their purist approaches , the King Arthur Flour folks applaud this increasingly popular method , which is less costly than store-bought bread and requires of one only to toss ingredients into an electric box and push a couple of buttons . <p> " Five years ago , I would 've eaten my words , " says Ms. Sands . " More than half of the questions callers ask have to do with bread machines , " she says , explaining that buyers of inexpensive brands often solicit their advice after producing lackluster loaves . <p> But , using a top-quality model ( they recommend Zojirushi ) makes all the difference , she says . <p> " We 're finding that even people who love to bake bread by hand will use a bread machine because it gives them a way not to have to go and buy bread , " says Ms. Sands , explaining that these people often resort to machine-made loaves during work weeks and return to old-fashioned kneading and rising on weekends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adult toy of the year , " has boosted sales of flour for home baking by 2 percent , says John Yurkus of the national Home Baking Association in Denver , Colo . <p> But , Jubinsky , whose grandmother used to send him off on his bicycle to buy the " flour with the horse on it " says he subscribes first and foremost to what he calls the " grandmother method , " or baking from scratch . <p> So do the Sandses , and for this they 're keeping a close watch on states , especially Iowa , where school administrators threaten to eliminate baking from home-economics classes . <p> " They 're looking at it from a purely economic point of view , " says Ms. Sands . " There 's more to bread baking than that : If you know how to bake bread , you 've got something that feeds your soul for the rest of your life . "
