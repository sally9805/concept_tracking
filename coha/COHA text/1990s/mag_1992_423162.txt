An eight-legged Dante will explore inside an active volcano <p> There was a very large eruption and the two of us down there were just blasted to the ground . Big rocks were everywhere , whistling through the air , " recalls volcanologist Philip R. Kyle with the wry detachment of someone describing a dangerous encounter long since past . <p> That was 1974 , when a combined New Zealand , French and American team attempted to make the first descent to the crater floor of Mt . Erebus , a smoldering volcano stuck in the frozen world of Antarctica . The crew of scientists and climbers had hoped to reach a rare lava lake within Erebus ' crater to collect samples of the gases escaping from the volcano . But the storm of flying rocks convinced Kyle and his comrades to abandon that venture . <p> Four years later , the persistent volcanologist went back again . He and a group of fellow New Zealanders actually succeeded in lowering a scientist by rope to within 30 meters of the crater floor . Once more , though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Kyle , " we had a small eruption again that showered everyone on the crater rim with rocks . A rock - a volcanic bomb - actually went by the legs of the guy who was hanging on the rope down in the crater . Burned a hole in his pants . And there was a little burn in the rope that he was hanging on , " says Kyle , now at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology in Socorro . <p> Two serious attempts , two failures . " We have n't tried since , ' laments Kyle . <p> Until now . <p> Kyle is preparing for yet another mission to explore Erebus ' lava lake , but this time with little risk to human life or limb . Instead , an eight-legged robot named Dante will dare the descent . <p> The project springs from the mind of William " Red " Whittaker , a risk-taking robotics expert at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh . Not only has Whittaker decided to challenge his mechanical progeny with some of the worst weather conditions Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the entire project , from conception to completion , in the span of a year . <p> " It 's a major-league gutsy move , " comments David Akin , a robotics researcher from the University of Maryland in College Park . <p> <p> Whittaker 's robotics team chose the name Dante for the crater explorer to recall a literary descent into another Erebus , described by the fourteenth century poet Dante Alighieri . In classical Greek mythology , the name Erebus refers to a region of darkness that forms part of the underworld , where dead souls must go . This is the land visited by Dante in his Divine Comedy . Having strayed from life 's path and lost his way , Dante seeks to return home by climbing down into the underworld and then out the other side . For part of his journey , Dante is guided by the ghost of the Roman poet Virgil . <p> Whittaker 's robo-Dante will have its own Virgil . This truck-like robot will serve as a transporter , carrying the smaller Dante from the coast to the mountaintop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the journey across the ice and snow , human operators will pilot Virgil . But when it reaches a base camp on the flank of Erebus , the eight-wheeled transporter will largely drive itself the last 2 km to the crater rim . <p> Like the ghost , this Virgil can not accompany its partner for the entire journey Only Dante can complete the quest . <p> In truth , Whittaker 's creation looks more like a web-spinning spider than a poet . The gangly Dante with its eight legs will lower itself into the crater by a tether anchored to Virgil . <p> Not only a rappelling rope , the tether also serves as the robotic equivalent of an umbilical cord . Through it , Dante can both receive electrical power from the diesel-powered Virgil and send up images and information . The transporter can then transmit that information to the field camp and possibly back to the United States via satellite . <p> Down on the crater floor , Dante will play the role of field geologist , collecting information that Kyle and his colleagues have long desired . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from volcanic vents called fumaroles . A gas chromatograph on Dante can quickly relay information about these gases back to the scientists , while the machine also collects direct samples for later analyses in the lab . <p> Escaping from inside the Earth , these gases contain clues about the source of the magma feeding Mt . Erebus . " For volcanoes , these gases - the volatile elements like carbon dioxide and water are like blood for a human being . They are the life body of a volcano , " says Kyle . <p> The volcanologist believes Erebus exhales copious amounts of carbon dioxide , but it is impossible to test that theory high up on the crater rim . " In order to really know what the composition of the gas is , samples have to be collected from high-temperature vents , which are in the crater . " <p> The robotics team also hopes Dante will collect samples of an unusual powdery material that rings the fumaroles on the crater floor . Scientists have spotted the powder from above , and they believe it forms when escaping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , copper and zinc to solidify on the ground . A similar process occurs inside the volcano , creating what will become ore deposits over thousands of years . By studying these minerals in an active volcano , geologists can learn more about ancient ore deposits that are mined today , says Kyle . <p> As Dante explores the crater , researchers will monitor its progress through color videocameras mounted on top of the robo-geologist . Black-and-white high-resolution cameras will serve as the eyes of the robot , providing stereoscopic vision to help it navigate . The crater crawler will also sport an instrument for analyzing the mass of small particles in the gases , as well as an electronic thermometer that can measure the temperature of the lava lake from a distance , says project manager James Osborn of Carnegie Mellon . <p> <p> Climb down , take a few samples , then climb out again . Though it sounds simple , the Erebus mission is pushing the very bounds of the robotics field . Whittaker describes the project as the hardest he has tackled in over a decade of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has seen plenty of challenges . In the mid-1980s , Whittaker designed a series of robots to assist in the cleanup of radioactively contaminated areas at the Three Mile Island nuclear power station . He has also created a six-legged walking robot called the Ambler and outdoor navigation vehicles that can drive themselves down a road at speeds of up to 50 miles per hour . <p> When asked to describe the difficulties of the Erebus project , Whittaker laughs , launching into a half-hour-long list of problems confronting the small army at Carnegie Mellon constructing the explorers . In a sense , the project represents one big exercise in applications : taking lab-proven technology and thrusting it into the harsh reality of the outside world . Inside a laboratory engineers can tailor the environment , smoothing out the rough edges to give a robot every chance at success , whether it be walking across a smooth floor or bouncing a balloon . Not so in nature . If a boulder or crevasse lies between a robot and its quarry the machine must maneuver around the obstacle . <p> All field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a particularly daunting landscape . While in the crater , Dante must negotiate cliffs , overhangs , fractures , soft ash beds and other nightmarish terrain rarely seen outside geologically active areas . " It 's as bad as it gets , " says Whittaker . <p> Because minor eruptions are continually reshaping the crater , the engineers can not even provide the explorer with terrain maps to guide its journey What 's more , the plumes of gases coming from the crater make it difficult to get clear aerial photographs , removing another source of information about the volcano 's interior . <p> The formidable weather at Erebus further complicates the task . At an altitude of 3,700 meters on the crater rim , the temperatures will hover around - 25 degrees C , with strong gusts of wind . The explorer must go from freezer to oven as it descends into the crater , where it might encounter temperatures as high as 800 degrees C inside the fumaroles . Making matters worse , says Whittaker , the gases rising from these vents also create corrosive hydrofluoric , hydrochloric and sulfuric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a steaming fumarole would spell an ignoble end for Dante . <p> " You 're talking about an extremely nasty environment , " comments Roger Quinn , a mechanical engineer who designs walking robots at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland . Because of the conditions on the mountain , the Carnegie Mellon team must create what robotics engineers call a robust system , one capable of functioning even after problems arise , says Quinn . " It 's a very difficult problem , " he adds . <p> The project also requires new developments in an arena of robotics known as task control - basically , the system that makes decisions for the robot . Human operators camped on Erebus ' flank will control some of the broader aspects of the mission , such as choosing the best site for collecting scientific samples . But decisions about where to place a foot are best left to software and silicon , says Whittaker . If difficulties arise , though , humans can intercede and pilot the robots . <p> <p> Of all the challenges the Erebus team faces , the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the $2 million for the project comes from a one-time appropriation to NASA 's robotics division , the Carnegie Mellon team has only a limited time to show some fruits of that funding . The short field season for Antarctic missions further constrains the timing , requiring the Dante-Virgil team to be ready by October . <p> " A lot of people would n't give this thing very good odds , " says Whittaker . " People have said it 's impossible to build the robots in the time frame and that the technology is not available . " <p> Dismissing the naysayers , Whittaker turns the tables , saying that short projects offer the greatest potential for advancing robotics . " The idea of a hard commitment , of focused and intense research , sets an environment for a particular quality of invention so that you really come up with the great ideas out of necessity " <p> Contrary to the popular vision of robots - fueled by such characters as R2D2 on " Star Wars " or the android Data on " Star Trek " - robotics is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk on their own without getting stuck in a corner . Because each project teaches something new , researchers stand to gain most by completing short , intense ventures , Whittaker argues . <p> He views the Erebus project as a natural stepping-stone toward designing robots that could explore other planets . After all , the harsh environment of an Antarctic volcano provides a natural testing ground for units that will negotiate the cold , rock-strewn surface of Mars . " I believe the order of accomplishment is going to be Erebus on the way to the moon on the way to Mars , " says Whittaker , who plans to be working on a lunar walker by this time next year . <p> With so much future potential , there 's a lot riding on the Erebus mission . Success on the volcano would give the Carnegie Mellon team a leg up on other robotics groups racing to design autonomous walkers that could serve future space missions . <p> A stalwart defender of the project , Whittaker does his best to convince others that Dante and Virgil will return with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if the machines accomplish only part of the mission , he believes they will succeed in pushing robotics toward new frontiers . <p> Maryland 's Akin agrees that the act of trying may be enough . " As far as I 'm concerned , " he says , " if this thing gets halfway down the crater and sends back some data and then a leg falls off , it 's still a success .
