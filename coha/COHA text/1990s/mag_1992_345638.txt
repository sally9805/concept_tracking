SCAR LOVER by Harry Crews <P> Poseidon ; 284 pages ; $19 <P> Imagine William Faulkner in a fright wig or Carson McCullers and Flannery O'Connor strapped side by side on a roller coaster , and you have Harry Crews writing Southern gothic .

Set for no apparent reason in the mid- ' 50s , the novel has an unsettling contemporary feel that makes every detail seem anachronistic . The prose , taut and terrifying early on when sex is a threat and violence a seduction , goes limp once Sarah and Pete embark on an apple-pie romance .
