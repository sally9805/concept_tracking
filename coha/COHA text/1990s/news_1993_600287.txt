<p> Just inside Goya Foods ' headquarters here , a sepia-toned mural tells the history of the company 's founders . <p> It shows how patriarch Prudencio Unanue immigrated from his native Spain to Puerto Rico in 1904 and to New York in 1915 . There , he established what has become the largest Hispanic-owned food company in the USA . <p> For two decades , Prudencio worked odd jobs in the food industry before he got on with a Spanish importer of olives and canned sardines . Then the Spanish Civil War started , halting trade and throwing Prudencio out of a job . <p> Unemployed , desperation became his inspiration , recalls his son , Joseph . " He had to do something . We had four kids and we had to eat . " <p> Homesick for the foods of Spain and Puerto Rico , Unanue believed Puerto Ricans , Cubans and other Caribbean immigrants were too . So in 1936 , he and his wife , Carolina , also of Spanish descent , started Goya Foods , the name borrowed from the sardine label @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goya Foods had annual revenue of $ 410 million , double-digit annual growth and 1,800 employees . In 1992 , revenue was $ 453 million , making it the USA 's largest Hispanic-owned business , according to the June issue of Hispanic Business , out May 22 . The Unanues ( u-NA-nu-way ) are also among the wealthiest Hispanic families in the U.S. with a net worth estimated at $ 330 million . <p> But wealth has n't come easily to the Unanue clan . Most have worked to make Goya a giant brand name along the East Coast , home to the U.S. ' largest concentration of Hispanic households outside the Southwest . <p> Joseph , 68 , who took over in 1977 , is president . Brother Frank , 61 , is president of Goya de Puerto Rico . Their children and the children of their brother , Charles and their deceased brother , Anthony , virtually all work for the company . <p> For decades , Goya Foods has dominated the Northeast , where it sells 80% of Hispanic foods . Key to its success : It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varieties of beans alone . Other top products include rice , tomato sauce , seasonings and olive oil . <p> Prudencio died in 1977 ; Carolina in 1984 . Were they still around , they probably would n't believe what their offspring are up to . The second- and third-generation Unanues are shaking up Goya 's mainstay Caribbean product mix with M &M:; mainstream and Mexican . And they are n't overlooking the waves of immigrants from the Dominican Republic , Central and Latin America . <p> Coping with these different tastes means a serious expansion of Goya 's product line , because Hispanics of Mexican and Central American descent enjoy foods unfamiliar to Hispanics of Caribbean descent - and vice versa . In fact , Goya introduced its first salsa in 1990 - Goya Salsa Picante Sauce - which it hopes will one day be as big as Heinz ketchup . <p> That may not be as difficult as it sounds , because the market for ethnic foods is hot . While overall supermarket revenue has been flat for several years , revenue of Mexican foods sold at supermarkets has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to reach $ 4 billion by 1997 . Last year , salsa surpassed ketchup as the USA 's best-selling condiment . <p> But Goya faces stiff competition : Major U.S. food companies , which market to mainstream America , dominate the Mexican foods market . In the sauces category , with $ 625 million annual revenue , Pace Foods is No. 1 with 26% market share . Pet 's Old El Paso is No. 2 with 20% . Goya is far down the list , with less than 1% . And with rapid growth in the U.S. Hispanic population - 5% a year vs. 1% overall growth - more major food companies are getting into the act . In January , Campbell Soup began marketing its mainstream soups and V-8 juice to Hispanics . Knorr has developed a line of Hispanic-oriented products distributed by Brooklyn 's Iberia Foods , a Hispanic-owned firm with annual revenue of $ 50 million . <p> " Obviously , they 're doing something right to be where they are , " says Maria Ibias , Iberia 's advertising director . " But we 're following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Goya must protect its market share in Hispanic-owned stores while increasing its presence in the mainstream . Both will be difficult in the ' 90s , says Smith Barney food industry analyst Ron Morrow . " Goya has been a strong regional label . It is not strong as you go nationwide . But Goya can do well if it does n't try to cover too much territory . " <p> Goya 's goals : <p> The mainstream . Last month , Goya introduced a frozen bread pudding ( based on a family recipe from Joseph 's wife , Carmen ) and a frozen cornbread . Next month , it unveils several Caribbean-style rice mixes . There are also plans for another salsa and guacamole . <p> A similar foray into the mainstream from 1982 to 1988 went largely unnoticed . But timing could n't be better now . Health-conscious consumers are replacing meat with beans to reduce cholesterol and increase fiber . So Goya is pumping up advertising . The old " Goya , oh boya " slogan is gone . In its place are slick TV commercials and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who could be Anglo or Hispanic , depending on one 's point of view . They are as mainstream as a Rice-a-Roni commercial . The slogan : " For better meals , turn to Goya . " <p> Goya is off to a good start , analysts say , but they agree it must become more aggressive . That means increasing ad spending , waging a tougher battle for shelf space and considering a joint venture with a larger company . <p> " They 're going to have to get in bed with a major company , such as Heinz , which could use its clout to position Goya in the mainstream , " says Bob Messenger of Food Business . <p> But Goya adamantly disagrees . Joseph Unanue says the firm will move at its own pace . <p> New immigrants . Every year , Goya introduces more spices , sauces and other products aimed at immigrants from Mexico and Central and Latin American countries . " As soon as we know they 've settled here , we look for products to sell to that group , " says Conrad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goya plans to shift its product mix , aiming to quadruple its revenue from Mexican foods from 5% to 20% in five years . Its strategy : to invade the West Coast , where the Hispanic population is 70% Mexican . <p> But first , the company must make Goya a national brand name . It 's hired distributors who know the Mexican market . But competitors are working fast . Campbell has distributed 36 million Spanish-language soup recipes in tortilla packages . Knorr , through Iberia Foods , is offering discount coupons and other giveaways , something Goya has never done . It also sells sauces , bouillon cubes and spices Goya does n't handle . So Goya is picking up the pace . Market research , for example , once deemed " a waste of time , " by Joseph Unanue , is now in fashion . The company is studying the demographics of various ZIP codes to locate pockets of Hispanics - and supermarkets in those areas . <p> Despite the heightened competition , Joseph Unanue , seated at his desk , a portrait of his father behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Prudencio taught him : " If you want it , you have to go out and get it . Even if you make a mistake , keep going after it .
