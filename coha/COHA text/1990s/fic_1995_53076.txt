As Moira came to the midpoint of her afternoon walk , the small unpainted cabin of Miss Bessie Rhode , the old woman spoke to her for the first time . <p> Leaning over the bare , wind-finished boards of her front yard fence , looking for all the world like a scrap of gray cloth hung to dry , the woman uttered the words grudgingly , " Hello , Missy . " <p> Moira supposed that she should feel some sort of triumph at this small victory , but truthfully , she did n't really care . Her brother , Victor , had warned her that the natives would not accept her , and that she should n't expect any kind of a welcome if she insisted on intruding her presence into the God-forsaken place ; but what he could n't seem to realize was that this did n't matter . In fact , such a situation was desirable to her , for she wanted nothing so much as to be left alone . <p> However , it was n't in her to be really rude , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and answered with sparse words of her own . " Hello . " <p> As far as she was concerned , this was the end of it . She continued moving up the road , her feet raising the dry dust into the gusts of wind that swooped down from the treetops , and rattled the dry brush along the roadside ; but by the way the old woman looked at her , she knew that the episode was not finished . <p> Despite a vague feeling of disquiet , she stopped . What could this old woman have to say to her ? For three weeks Moira had been walking past the cabin every afternoon . Why now was the woman speaking to her ? <p> Miss Rhode cleared her throat . The sound was as dry as her wrinkled face . " I thought you ought to know , " she said , fixing Moira with her bright , black eyes . " You being a woman all alone up there , you have a right to know . " <p> Moira found herself coming closer , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden beside the house . <p> " What ? " Moira said . " What should I know ? " <p> " . . . Goatman , " said the old woman , and Moira came closer still . Had she heard what she thought she had heard ? " What ? " she asked again . <p> " It 's Goatman , " said the old woman , snapping out the words . " He 's back again . Been seen around Clarence Hooker 's place , and killed a hound up at Carter 's . You 'd best keep your doors and windows locked , and keep that dog of yours close to the house . " <p> Moira looked down the road in the direction in which Tray had gone running after the rabbit they had startled in the middle of the road . <p> " Do you have a gun ? " <p> Wordlessly Moira shook her head , and felt the wind wrap her hair around her throat and across her cheeks . <p> " It would n't hurt none to have one , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just wanted to tell you . Seeing as how you 're a woman alone . " <p> Why did she keep harping on that ? " You 're alone , too , " Moira said somewhat accusingly . <p> What might have been amusement flickered in the old woman 's eyes . " That 's a different thing , " she said , turning away . " I 'm an old woman , and I 'm no city-folk . I can take care of myself . " <p> Meaning I ca n't , I suppose , thought Moira , feeling a flash of annoyance . " Well , thanks for the warning , " she called in what she intended to be a sarcastic tone , but the old woman was already walking toward the house , and in a moment , Moira was left alone in the road . <p> * * * By suppertime , the wind had not lessened , and Moira , preparing her evening meal at the sink in front of the window , could see the tops of the trees at the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky . It was going to be a beautiful , wild night , and for the first time in months , she felt a kind of excitement stirring inside her . <p> She could feel the warmth of the wood stove behind her , and she turned from the window to face the room . She loved the interior of the one-room cabin . It was simple , and functional , much as it had been when her great-aunt , Ida , had lived here . Victor might scoff at it , as indeed he had , but it satisfied some need in her . <p> The day after she moved into the cabin , her brother , Victor , had come to see her . <p> " It looks like something out of one of those awful old movies , " Victor said , looking very much out of place in his beige sports outfit , which Moira was certain had been advertised as the latest thing in country wear . He posed in the doorway , looking fastidious and elegant , and suddenly she felt as tired of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sophisticated , artificial people she had come here to escape . <p> " You 'll be back within a week . " His attractive , triangular smile took the sting from his words . " This place is primitive , Moira . A pump ! I ca n't believe it ! And where is the john ? " <p> " In back of the cabin . " She had to smile at his very real horror . <p> He struck his forehead with the back of his hand . " A Chic Sale ! Now I know you 're out of your mind ! " <p> A stricken look flashed across his mobile face , and Moira went to him and took his hand , exerting a gentle pressure . " Victor , it 's all right . I can talk about it now . I can talk about nervous breakdowns , mental illness . " She smiled wryly . " In fact , for nine months , it seems I 've talked of little else . " <p> And that 's the truth , she thought . In her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring it all out ; all the bitterness , all the repressed love and hidden hatred that she had felt for her husband , Jason . Dr. Speegler had helped her see that her anger was a natural thing . She had felt betrayed , which was only natural , since in the very act of marrying her , Jason had betrayed her . <p> She had married Jason believing he was everything she had ever dreamed of ; handsome , clever , sure of himself . The fact that he attempted no physical liberties with her before marriage , she put down to his self-control , his concern for her inexperience . But , after the wedding . . . She drew a shuddering breath . She could think of it now , even talk about it , but the thought still brought pain . It all came down to one hurtful , unalterable fact ; Jason was not able to physically love a woman . That portion of his life was reserved for other men . <p> No purpose would be served by going over it again ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul and mind-ripping cry of , why ? Why did you marry me ? <p> Dr. Speegler had helped her understand it , and deal with it , and now she needed peace , peace and quiet , and isolation , so that she could learn to live with it . <p> She felt the touch of Victor 's hand on her arm . " Moira , are you sure you 'll be all right alone ? It 's like the end of the Earth out here , and the cabin 's falling apart . Nobody has lived here since Aunt Ida died . " <p> She smiled , and touched his face . " Dear Victor . Of course . I 've always loved it here , you know that . Besides , I have Tray for company . " <p> Of course he had gone away still not understanding , for how could she have explained the appeal that this primitive simplicity had for her . She knew that in his own , rather unsteady way , her brother loved her and worried about her , and she appreciated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be alone just now . <p> Supper over , and the dishes put away , she put more wood into the Franklin stove , turned up the flame on the kerosene lamp , and settled , with a book , into the old rocker . Tray lay at her feet , rump turned to the heat of the stove , drowsing . <p> The wind seemed stronger now that darkness had fallen , and Moira was conscious of thumps and scratching sounds , as branches and twigs were blown against the walls of the cabin . She tried to immerse herself in her book , but she found the sounds distracting . <p> Up until now , she had felt no fear of staying in the cabin alone . Tray was a good watch dog , and somehow it had never occurred to her that there was any reason to be afraid . <p> Tonight , however , she felt a touch of uneasiness . The sounds of the wind and brush sounded disturbingly like someone , or something , was trying to get into the cabin , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Goatman . " Who or what was he ? Miss Rhode had seemed to assume that she would know . He must be a piece of local legend . Something that everyone in this part of the country knew about . Everyone but her , one of the " city-folk . " <p> She let the book fall to her lap , bemused by the mystery of the name . The old woman had said that she should protect herself , but against what ? What kind of danger did this Goatman represent ? <p> She was started from her reverie by Tray 's low growl , and found herself sitting upright , grasping the arms of the rocker . Tray was still at her feet , but the hair around his heavy neck was raised , and the low growl continued to rise in his throat . <p> " What is it , boy ? What is it ? " she whispered . <p> Then she noticed the knob on the front door . Slowly , it was moving ; turning back and forth . The simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own neck rise , and Tray , thrusting forward with powerful legs , threw himself at the door , barking furiously . <p> Moira , in her chair , found herself powerless to move . In a few moments , Tray 's barks faded to whines , as he paced back and forth before the door , and Moira could see that the knob was no longer moving . <p> She let out the breath she had not realized that she had been holding , and called to Tray . He came to her side , whining and twisting his body . He wanted her to open the door , to let him go after whoever or whatever had been standing on the other side . She quieted him with words and pats , and in a little while , he seemed to have forgotten their visitor . She wished that it was as easy to quiet her own mind . <p> The morning sun shone on a world of wind-cleared beauty . The sky was dazzling , and the air bore the crisp bite of the approaching winter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scattered by the wind , but Moira could not see that there had been any real damage done . <p> With Tray at her side , she walked around the cabin , looking in the soft , turned earth of the flower beds for some sign of last night 's visitor . <p> Near the side window , she found tracks , but she was unable to identify them . They were vaguely oval in shape , blurred by the wind-blown dust . There were only two of them , but then she supposed , if it had been an animal , the creature could have stood with his hind feet on the hard ground beyond the narrow border of soft earth . <p> The placement of the tracks made it look as if the creature had stood just outside the window , looking in . <p> Moira repressed a shudder , and tried to put the thought of the turning door knob out of her mind . <p> Tray sniffed at the footprints and whined nervously . She took him by the collar and let him into the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then took it outside and carefully placed it over the prints ; pushing the edges of the box firmly into the soft earth . <p> After her morning tasks were finished , Moira found herself restless . She did not feel like doing any of the things that normally occupied her time . She recognized the restlessness as unusual , for up until now , she had been content to drift through the days , resting , dreaming , doing nothing . <p> It was , she told herself , the fault of the old woman , Miss Rhode , and her Goatman . That , and the wind . Well , since she could n't get the matter out of her mind , perhaps she could find some information about Goatman . If Miss Rhode knew about him , surely other people did , too . <p> Dulcimer , the nearest town , had a population of 1,500 people . After picking up some needed supplies , Moira parked her car in front of the old , ivy-covered brick library , leaving Tray inside the car with the windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very friendly . Moira hesitated only slightly before asking her if the library had any information on a " Goatman . " <p> " Goatman ? Why , I have n't heard that name in years . " Mrs. Fairchild smiled , and for an instant , Moira could see the pretty young woman who had been , underneath the rather plain middle-aged woman that she was . <p> " Why , my old Grandma used to scare me with stories about Goatman , when I was child . I used to have nightmares about him , all hairy and goat-smelling , with burning red eyes . " She moved her shoulders in a brief , shuddery motion . <p> Moira was conscious of a keen disappointment . Was that all Goatman was , a bogeyman for children ? <p> " A neighbor of mine mentioned him , " she said , hesitantly . " She seemed to think that there might be some sort of danger . . . " <p> " Oh , that 's right , you live out at the old Dearborne place . " Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , the people still believe in the old legends . They have stories that you would n't believe . <p> " Now , let 's see . There was an article , just last fall , in one of the big papers . Some writer came out here and talked to people . . . " <p> She turned away from Moira and walked to the back of the room , where she pulled out a large drawer from a tall , dark cabinet . <p> " Here it is . " She unfolded a yellowing paper , and pointed to an article on one of the inside pages . Moira took the paper and held it to the light . Conscious of the smell of the dust , and of Mrs. Fairchild 's watchful appraisal , she read : <p> " Baltimore , Maryland , Aug. 25 , 1974 : The people who live in the deep forest find it easy to believe in things that city dwellers scoff at . Take the case of Goatman , a very real entity to the folk who live in Prince Georges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live . <p> " Last week , Toller , a blue tick hound belonging to Bill Wheeler , was found horribly mutilated at the edge of the Wheeler property , which adjoins the forest . Old Toller is only one of the five dogs whose deaths are credited to the mysterious creature known as Goatman . <p> " What does Goatman look like ? The accounts vary considerably . Some say he 's about the size of a man , with legs like a goat , and the torso , head and arms of a man . Others say that sometimes he walks upright , and sometimes on all fours , and is entirely covered with long hair . <p> " Some say that Goatman is a man , or least he once was a man . A scientist at the nearby Agricultural Center , who has experimented on goats , believes that this man went mad , and ran away to live in a hut in the woods . <p> " At any rate , whatever Goatman looks like , if you have occasion to go walking in the woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , carry a big stick , and maybe a bag of garlic around your neck . " <p> Moira rolled the images over in her mind . Of course the stories had to be apocryphal , but the concept was intriguing ; and here , where the forest loomed and houses could be a mile or more apart , easy to accept . She had always felt that forests were magical , possessed of a life not visible to ordinary humans . Standing beneath a great tree , listening to the wind whisper in its branches , how could you not feel that the tree had a life , a spirit , a soul ? <p> Forests and woods had always fueled imagination . Perhaps it was a human response to that which reminded them of their old connection with the earth and nature , a connection which modem life had worn so thin . But she was getting fanciful . Time to check out her books and get back to the car before Tray became too impatient . <p> The setting sun was washing the meadow with color when Moira @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees , grass , stones  --  was bathed in a heavy , amber light . The beauty of it made tears come to her eyes . <p> She unloaded the groceries , fed Tray , and fixed a hearty meal for herself . For some reason she felt unaccountably hungry . <p> After her meal , drowsy from the food and the warmth of the fire , she could not keep her mind on the book in her lap . Half-sleeping , her mind pondered the puzzle of Goatman . Was he simply a woodsy version of the bogeyman  --  as Mrs. Fairchild seemed to think  --  a local variation of Bigfoot , frightening people on lonely farms , or something much , much older ? <p> Her book dropped to the floor , temporarily rousing her , and early though it was , she crawled into her bed , beneath the cozy , brightly colored quilts , into the soft arms of the old feather mattress , and was soon deeply asleep , Tray lying in his usual place beside the bed . <p> Sometime during the night , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a sound . Lip her consciousness came , borne on the thread of melody , a strange tune , but not unpleasant ; and then sleep would claim her , and snatches of dreams , until the sound would call her up again . She felt herself rise and fall as if she was being home on a large , warm wave , until she was jolted into full wakefulness by Tray 's echoing bark , and the sounds of his claws on the wooden floor . <p> She sat up abruptly , her hair falling over her eyes , to find her heart pounding . She could see the outline of Tray 's body as he strained against the door , barking furiously . <p> Feeling out of focus and confused , Moira moved to Tray 's side . In the moonlight , she could see him looking up at her , beseeching her to let him out to take care of this intruder on their nighttime quiet . <p> Moira put a hand on his bristling neck . " Shh , boy . Shh . " Apprehensively , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meadow , gilded by the light of the full moon , rising just above the trees . Was that a shadow , there , toward the front of the cabin ? She shivered , her feet chilled by the cold boards of the floor . Should she let Tray out ? Let him chase away whatever was out there , or should she keep him here , by her side ? <p> Tray was growing frantic . She could feel his eagerness to be out there , his need to confront what he considered his enemy . Almost unwillingly , Moira reached for the bolt , and drew it back . The door was hardly open when Tray squeezed through , and burst into the yard . <p> As soon as he was out of the door , she regretted her decision . Barring the door behind him , she leaned against it , listening to the sound of his voice growling and barking , expecting to hear the sound dwindle as he and quarry fled for the trees at the edge of the meadow . But the sound did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Ears straining , she could hear a scrabbling , a scuffling . Whatever it was , it was not running . It was standing its ground . <p> Filled with misgivings , she rushed to the one window , but it was facing the wrong way . <p> Still the terrible growling and scuffling ; then Tray came into view , backing away from something , a dark shape that stood upright ; no , it walked on all fours . She strained to see , but the shape seemed to change before her very eyes . Then the figure disappeared from view , and appeared to be moving away from the cabin , as Tray 's barks and growls grew fainter . Finally , she could hear no sound at all , except for the faint whine of the wind , which had begun to rise , during the fight . <p> Suddenly , cold with a great fear , Moira rushed to the bed and burrowed beneath the quilts . For the rest of the night , she lay curled into a numb ball , trying to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying not to feel like a coward for not opening the door and looking for him . <p> The dawn broke as pink and tender as if it was just another morning , but Moira knew that it was not . Tray had not come back , whining at the door to be let in after frightening away the midnight prowler . Moira watched the light fill the window , then rose and hurriedly dressed . <p> Timidly , she opened the cabin door and stepped out , resenting what the night had done to her . Her peace was shattered , her armor of apathy breached . <p> The flower beds showed the marks of the battle ; broken flowers lay scattered on the earth . She called for Tray , hesitantly , then louder , but received no answer other than a bird call from the woods . Shivering , she ventured farther , then farther , from the cabin . <p> It was down by the woodshed that she found him . His once intelligent eyes were dusty and glazed , and his glossy coat splattered with blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In her present state of mind , Moira knew that she could not bury him alone . After covering him with a tarp , she got into the car and drove , dry-eyed and almost unthinkingly , down to Four Comers , where she knew Mr. Thompson would be minding his one gas pump , cold drink machine , and a small collection of groceries . Miss . Rhode 's place was closer , but there would be no one there but the old woman , and Moira needed the physical strength of a man . <p> When she pulled to a stop at the Corners , she could see that there were two other men there , besides Mr. Thompson . One of them she recognized as Old Man Crowly , a crotchety old relic who lived up in the hills behind Thompson 's place . She did not recognize the other man . <p> Her legs felt unsteady , but she tried to appear calm and unemotional as she faced their studiously closed , but nonetheless expectant faces . <p> " I need some help , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need someone to help me bury him . " <p> Moira thought that she could sense contempt behind their blank eyes . Probably their women could bury a dog or kill and skin a hog , if necessary . <p> She tried again . " I thought that since you gentlemen know about wild animals , maybe you could tell me what kind of animal killed him . " <p> Their faces softened a little . In the end all three of them came with her ; Thompson putting up a " closed " sign against his rickety gas pump , and following her in his rain of a pickup . <p> At the site of the death , they hunkered down around Tray , looking at him from every angle , examining the stuffed-up dust around the body . They examined the flower bed carefully , particularly the footprint Moira had protected . They chewed their wads of snuff , and talked quietly among themselves until Moira felt like an intruder . <p> Then they buried Tray in back of the house , and wiped their red hands on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Moira realized that they were going to say nothing unless she directly confronted them . She planted herself in front of Thompson , and attempted to look him in the eye . <p> " What killed him , Mr. Thompson ? What killed Tray ? " <p> He kept his eyes studiously on the ground . <p> " Oh , could have been a bear , I guess . Maybe a wolf . There 's a few of them left , they say . " <p> The other men stood silently , scuffling their heavy boots in the dust . <p> Moira bit her lip , then almost pleadingly touched Thompson 's arm . " Miss Rhode said something about a Goatman . . . " <p> Thompson at last looked up . " What 'd she say ? " <p> " She said something about his killing a dog , another dog , and she said I should be careful and keep Tray close to the house . " <p> " Should of done , " said Old Man Crowly , sharply . " Goatman has done for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old man an angry glance , but to Moira 's relief , Crowly went on . " She has a right to know , her a woman alone here . It 's best that she knows . " <p> " Miss Rhode did n't explain , " she said humbly . " Wo n't you tell me what Goatman is ? Please ? " <p> " Oh , hell ! " said Thompson . " Might as well . Goatman 's a woodsy thing , Missy . There 's been stories about him as long as I can recollect . Most of the time he lives back deep in the woods , but every once in a while he comes out , closer to where people live , and somebody sees him . I 've heard said that he 's the last of his kind , and comes out because he gets lonesome . Dogs hate him , and they attack him , and sometimes , I guess , he has to kill them to protect himself . Sometimes he kills other things , too , or at least so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hat and scratched his thinning white hair . " There 's all kinds of stories . Some say that he does good things too . I 've heard tell that sometimes he helps folks that git lost in the woods . And Mrs. Jenkins swears that he pulled out her milk cow that got stuck in the bog . " <p> " What does he look like ? " Moira 's question came out so softly that she was surprised that Thompson heard her . <p> " Some say he looks like a hairy man , with goat 's ears . Some say he 's half man and half goat . But all say that he 's terrible strong . Some say he 's killed men and women , too , but myself , I think that 's just scare talk . " <p> Old Man Crowly spat in the dirt . " My old Grandma , she used to tell us that if'n someone , a woman , would go with Goatman , back to his hidey-hole in the woods , he would n't bother folks no more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a girl , a young woman went out to him , went with him , and for twenty years nobody seen hide nor hair of either of them , When he started showin ' up again folks figured that she had died . They tried to get another girl to go , but no one would do it . They was all afraid . " <p> Moira felt the hair along her backbone stir , and clasped herself with her arms . She looked searchingly at each man , but not one weathered face expressed anything but sincerity and embarrassment . It was , she realized , not easy for these men to speak to her of these things . <p> " Then you think Goatman killed Tray ? " she said . <p> Thompson shrugged . " Did n't say so , Missy . You just asked what we know about Goatman , and I told you . Well , boys , we 'd best be on our way . " <p> Moira gave each of the men a few dollars , and they got into the old pickup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until they were out of sight . <p> That night , for the first time in months , the nightmares came back . In her dreams she saw Jason 's face . Then Jason 's face was replaced by a bizarre , hirsute countenance . <p> In the next moment , Moira snapped awake , suddenly and completely . The image of the dream was still in her mind , and her first reaction was wonder , as she realized that in her dream , she had been much more frightened by the face of her ex-husband than by the face of Goatman . <p> As she became conscious of the fact that Tray was not beside her , that she was completely alone , a cold trickle of fear seemed to slide beneath the warm quilt had lie against her belly . <p> She lay awake until dawn , but heard nothing unusual inside or outside the cabin . As she got out of bed , still tired , she could not understand why she felt a sense of disappointment . <p> Victor paid his weekly visit the next day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that Tray had wandered off , and had not come home . She did n't dare tell him that the dog had been killed ; she just did n't feel up to the pressure he would put on her to leave the cabin , and come back to the city . <p> Even so , he was upset . " I do n't like the idea of you being here alone , " he said , and she could see his real concern for her in his eyes . " It was bad enough with just the dog , but at least I felt that you had some protection . " <p> She shrugged and raised her hands . " Against what , Victor ? Just what do you think is going to harm me out here ? " <p> As she said the words , a guilty shiver tingled up her spine , and she wondered at herself , at her action . Tray 's death had made her feel that she really might be in physical danger ; and yet , she could n't bear the thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought and concentrated on using her charm to sway Victor into being more accepting of her plans to stay . <p> " You can bring me another dog , " she said , smiling at him , and touching his hand . " A very large , fierce dog , if you wish . " <p> She could tell that he still was n't happy about her decision , but at least he did not seem disposed to argue further . <p> That night she prepared herself for bed very carefully , telling herself that it was because she needed a good night 's sleep , and bedtime rituals could be very important . In the glow of lantern light , she had a lovely bath before the fire . Then she put on the long , old-fashioned lawn nightgown that felt so soft against the skin . After that , she brushed her hair a hundred strokes , and then made a pot of chamomile tea , sweetened with honey , which she drank with the last of the almond cookies which Victor had brought her from the city . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt very drowsy and relaxed . Settling herself into the soft pillows , she felt safe and protected . As she sank into sleep she wondered that she felt none of the nervousness or fear that had plagued her the night before . <p> She knew she dreamed that night , because when she awoke the shadow of the dream was still there , a feeling of joy , of freedom , of arousal ; she wanted to cling to it , but it slipped away as consciousness brushed it aside . <p> She found herself sitting up in her bed , the covers thrown aside , listening for the sound that had awakened her . <p> At first there was nothing but the wind , and the soft cry of a night bird , and then it came , growing softly , swelling swirling . She put her hand to her throat . It was beautiful , like nothing she had ever heard . <p> Getting out of bed , she slid her feet into her slippers , her skin drawing back from the cold smoothness of the leather . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and purple shawl , gratefully drawing its soft warmth about her shoulders . It was odd how alive she felt , how aware of every physical thing , the touch of cloth , the cold woodsy scent of the air . And there was something else on the air , another scent , musky and stirring . <p> She took a deep breath , and moved toward the door , knowing now that she had come here for a reason , that she had not been running away from , but running toward , something . <p> Opening the door , she went out to meet it . <p> Behind her the wind swept leaves into the room , the lantern went down , and the fire went out . That was the way Victor found the cabin when he came to see her the next week . <p> ILLUSTRATION : " That we both want to be reincarnated as cats is a lovely and comforting thought , Mr. Burlington , but not necessarily the basis for a deep and lasting relationship .
