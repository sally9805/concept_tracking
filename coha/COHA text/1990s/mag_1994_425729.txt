Heredity and Human Nature As a result of genetic research , human nature is making a comeback . Some liberals are feeling uneasy . <p> HEREDITARIANISM is on the march . Nature is clobbering nurture . A steady drip , drip , drip of scientific studies is cumulatively telling us that more and more human traits are genetically influenced . Some of the findings are based on studies of twins and adoptions ; others have been generated by research in molecular biology and related hard sciences . The media have shown a particular interest in recent data linking genes to sexual orientation , alcoholism , violent and criminal behavior , and obesity , not to mention cheating on wives . " Infidelity : It may be in our genes , " proclaimed the August 15 Time cover . The cover story , by Robert Wright , was based on his new book , The Moral Animal : Evolutionary Psychology and Everyday Life , a work heavily influenced by the science of sociobiology  --  which has also generated a lot of data linking genes to human behavior . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on IQ , although you would have difficulty deducing from the coverage that in this area there has been no serious dispute for decades about a powerful genetic effect . The August 9 Boston Globe  --  which was bracing its readers for The Bell Curve : Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life , by Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray ( to be published in October )  --  had a headline that could have appeared forty years ago : " IQ Fight Renewed ; New Book Links Genes , Intelligence . " <p> Curiously unnoticed by the reporters and anchorpersons of America is my own favorite finding of recent years : that political beliefs are strongly influenced by genes . The finding , exhaustively documented in the twin study program at the University of Minnesota , asks you to imagine a continuum of political attitudes . At one end are instinctive conservatives , here conceived as people who tend to respect traditional values and established authority ; at the other end are rebellious types generally inclined to kick over the traces . One 's place on this continuum is established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservatism . It turns out that the test scores of identical twins ( who are , of course , genetically indistinguishable ) correlate far more closely than do the scores of fraternal twins ( who have only about half their genes in common ) , even when the identical twins were reared apart and the fraternal twins were brought up together in the same household . <p> The media 's rendering of the news about genes has been uneven , incomplete ( especially in dealing with male - female differences ) , and maddeningly misleading in major respects . Still , there is no doubt that the literate public has been assimilating a few large truths : that genes play a greater role in human behavior than previously posited ; that human beings are somewhat less malleable than had been assumed ; that human nature is making something of a comeback . Onward to Utopia <p> THE centrality of human nature , a.k.a " instinct , " was received wisdom in psychology and anthropology early in this century . It was very much onstage in the world 's first serious psychology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , a work that drew heavily on Darwinian parallels between human and animal behavior . The Darwinian paradigm remained dominant for many decades . <p> By mid century , however , this model was pretty much undone in the realm of ideas . It was fighting Marxism and Freudianism , whose alternative visions both featured human behavior shaped by the environment . In addition , the master-race version peddled by the Nazis had made hereditarianism much harder to defend . It was gradually supplanted by a commitment to one or another form of cultural determinism . In Search of Human Nature , by Carl N. Degler of Stanford , traces the rise of this new model to anthropologist Franz Boas , who had been assailing hereditarian ideas as early as 1910 and whose students and disciples increasingly nudged the thinking classes toward a model of human development in which " culture , " rather than biology , was supreme . By the 1950s , anthropologist Ashley Montagu was proclaiming that man " has no instincts , because everything he is and has become he has learned , acquired , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Sociological Society hailed " the new optimism , " identifie d as a conviction that " anybody can learn anything . " <p> This expansive view of human malleability was exactly what numerous social engineers were eager to hear in the Sixties , and it still lingers in high-minded rhetoric about educational reform . In 1987 , when he was the chief executive of Xerox , David Kearns made a speech calling for " a new national agenda " and proposing , incredibly , that " every student  --  without exception  --  should master a core curriculum equivalent to college entrance requirements . " Possibly owing to his utopian credentials , Kearns later became deputy secretary of education in the Bush Administration . <p> Adapting to the era of limited malleability has not been easy for the media . First , there has been endless confusion about and misrepresentation of the data . One keeps reading that the evidence points to homosexuality being " immutable , not a personal choice " ( Los Angeles Times ) , or that " sexual or-ientation is innate " ( New York Times ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston Globe ) . Or , when the subject is data pointing to genetic and biochemical markers for violent behavior , that " biology is destiny " ( Time ) . Or , in news stories about a hereditary basis for obesity , that a particular gene " is the cause of " compulsive eating ( St. Louis Post-Dispatch ) . <p> The principal difficulty with all these formulations  --  in some cases , they are hedged or qualified elsewhere in the article I am quoting  --  is that none of the data now emerging postulates any such determined outcomes . The news is about probabilities , not about " destiny . " In every case the data concern genetic effects that " predispose " one in this or that direction and thereby change the odds of particular outcomes . They represent new estimates of the " heritabilities " involved in the trait . The heritability of obesity , for example , is apparently somewhere around 0.40 , meaning that 40 per cent of the population 's variability in body weight is attributable to genes , leaving 60 per cent for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent or more overweight in relation to height and body type . ) For homosexuality the heritability may be as high as 0.50 . Some scholars say it is in about the same zone for alcoholism . ( Others are profoundly skeptical of any genetic influence at all in alcoholism . ) For political attitudes it is about 0.60 , a figure raising the question of whether ideological sperm banks are just over the horizon . For IQ the heritability is even higher , by some measures as high as 0.80 . <p> A second , related problem with the press coverage is its insistent politicization of the data . Over and over again , one sees the media spin doctors gravitating to questions about the political implications of the news : whether it is good or bad for this or that politically correct cause , and , if bad , whether such research should be continued . <p> This was particularly the case with data suggesting a biological basis for violent crime . The existence of such data has been documented in many different ways . Studies have repeatedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in various measures of criminality . It is clear that several traits associated with violent criminals  --  muscular physique , low IQ , and impulsiveness  --  are strongly influenced by genes . Dr. Markku Linnoila of the National Institutes of Health has spent many years building a data base relating deficiencies in serotonin ( a brain-based chemical that facilitates transmissions between neurons ) to impulsive violent behavior , and almost nobody doubts he is on to something . The Nazi Tradition ? <p> THE BIG issue about such studies nowadays is not so much their validity as the permissibility of pursuing them at all . The hangup here is racial : Justice Department data indicate that blacks , who represent about 12 per cent of the U.S. population , commit about half of all violent crimes ( defined as murder , non-negligent manslaughter , rape , aggravated assault , and robbery ) . Which raises the prospect that any research into the genetic and/or biological roots of violent crime would at some point be addressing differences in racial propensities . Numerous scholars are determined that no such research be done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are acting in the Nazi tradition . <p> Prominent among those making such points is Dr. Peter Breggin , founder of the Center for the Study of Psychiatry , who was recently quoted in the Atlanta Journal and Constitution as concerned that the research would turn into a witch hunt against inner-city black kids . He added : " For America to suggest that the problem lies in them is hypocritical and evil , and to think of doing genetic studies in our inner cities is very close to the Nazi philosophy of blaming and oppressing the victim . " Two years ago , the NIH was supporting a conference , to be held at the University of Maryland , on genetic factors in crime . Breggin howled , as did the Congressional Black Caucus . NIH Director Bernadine Healy instantly caved , and the conference was never held . <p> Political correctness has also been onstage in coverage of the data on gays . In this instance , however , there have been no demands for suppression of the data , which the gay-rights movement generally finds congenial . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ researchers . One is neurobiologist Simon LeVay , who in 1991 , when he was at the Salk Institute in La Jolla , reported that a particular cell cluster in the hypothalamus was smaller in gay men than in straight men . The other is Dean Hamer of the National Cancer Institute , who reported in Science last year that he had found differences in the DNA of gay and straight men . Both LeVay and Hamer have repeatedly stated that their research does not point to a " gay gene " and does not imply that homosexuality is determined before birth . <p> Why , then , would so many media accounts create the opposite impression ? Doubtless a contributing factor is the difficulty so many newsrooms have in dealing with complex quantitative data . But I believe that the main reason is political : the concept of a predetermined sexual orientation offered irresistible polemical opportunities to PC editorialists . For openers , it gave them a chance to beat the " Radical Right " over the head . If evangelicals say that homosexuality is " immoral , " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexual orientation . So it would be nice to argue that no choice is involved  --  gayness , no less than straightness , is a God-given trait . As elaborated by a Boston Globe editorialist : " The arguments of homophobes usually imply that homosexuals are somehow making a perverted choice . But the findings of Hamer 's team . . . would tend to show that homosexuality . . . is biologically determined . . . . It could ease the struggle to secure equal protection for all Americans , regard less of sexual orientation . " <p> The notion of a biologically determined sexual orientation had another attractive implication for progressive journalists . It meant that parents could no longer rationally defend their objections to gay influences in their children 's lives . As Time argued in an article a year ago ( July 26 , 1993 ) : " Parents might be more relaxed about allowing children to have gay teachers , Boy Scout leaders , and other role models , on the assumption that the child 's future is written in his or her genetic makeup . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we move from biologically determined outcomes to mere tendencies . If a boy had any predisposition to gayness , his parents would possibly be more concerned about gay Scoutmasters than if they had never heard of the new research . <p> An amusing footnote to these arguments emerged from some comments made by Dean Hamer at last winter 's San Francisco meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science . At a news conference , Hamer expressed concern about one possible application of his research . He raised the possibility that the findings would lead eventually to prenatal tests for the predisposition to homosexuality , worried that some parents might elect to abort any fetuses at risk of being gay , and said he hoped to patent the gene in question and prevent homophobic parents from misusing his research . His position was widely reported , and applauded , and my search in Nexis turned up a non-amazing non-event . There were no editorials saying Hamer 's plan was in conflict with a woman 's right to abort unwanted pregnancies . Anything You Can Do . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment of data on male - female differences . The press has done fairly well at rendering the work of Harvard psychologist Carol Gilligan  --  Nexis was recently offering 547 articles that mention her  --  and especially the core concepts of her book In a Different Voice , which portrays women as far more empathetic and " caring " than men . This thought , which had arguably occurred to your grandmother long before Professor Gilligan got around to it , has now been assimilated by most feminist thinkers . But the media and modern feminism are still rigidly rejecting the avalanche of data depicting basic differences in male and female intellectual skills . <p> A striking instance of the rejection was the colossally uninformed coverage of the lawsuit last winter in which the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Center for Fair &; Open Testing called upon the U.S. Department of Education to declare the Scholastic Aptitude Test in violation of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 , which bars sex discrimination in federally funded education . The suit 's basic proposition : that the SAT ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A " now stands for Assessment ) obviously discriminates against young women . Principal evidence : that women represent 55 per cent of the high-school juniors taking the preliminary SAT but only 40 per cent of those whose test scores qualify them for National Merit Scholarships . To qualify , you have to be above the 98th percentile of the testees . <p> A thought that was almost impossible to find in media coverage of this event was that this is precisely what serious students of male - female differences would have expected . There is broad ( not quite total ) agreement that men and women are on average equal in mental ability : they have different strengths and weaknesses , with a huge advantage for men in spatial abilities , which are deeply implicated in mathematical talent , and an offsetting verbal advantage for women . Camilla Benbow of Iowa State University is among the numerous scholars who believe these differences have a biological basis . <p> If the sexes are on average equal in ability , why would men be dominant among the National Merit Scholarship winners ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variable than females , i.e. , the distribution of their scores is less bunched around the mean . David Lubinski of Iowa State and Professor Benbow , two prominent researchers who have studied the variability issue , have analyzed the test scores of several hundred thousand high-school students and concluded that even in domains where females have a higher average , males will be more variable . Obvious implication : in any sizable group of gifted ( or retarded ) students , you would expect males to be overrepresented . <p> I said above that it was " almost impossible " to find this thought in the media . In fact , I stumbled upon it in only one place : in a public-television discussion program called To the Contrary . The program has only female discussants , and on the day I tuned in one of them was Linda Chavez , who said that the National Merit Scholarship results were not surprising , since the greater male variability was well established . To be sure , Miss Chavez is a conservative and an occasional NATIONAL REVIEW contributor . <p> Taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news to conservatives than to liberals . Down through the years , conservatives have almost always been less attracted to political initiatives  --  public housing , penal rehabilitation , the Job Corps , Head Start , international Communism  --  that were in some measure advertised as creating new and better kinds of human beings . Conservatives tend to be far gloomier than leftists and liberals in judging the possibilities of changing mankind . In A Conflict of Visions , published in 1987 , Thomas Sowell argued persuasively that their different perspectives on human nature were fundamental to their disagreements on a wide range of public-policy questions . Contrasting the utopianism of the Left with the " constrained vision " of the Right , Sowell wrote : " What fundamentally distinguishes the two visions is their respective perceptions of human potential . " <p> In the IQ debate , or at least that portion of it centering on the nature - nurture issue , conservatives have generally seemed quite comfortable with data running up the score for nature , possibly because the evidence confirms their intuitive doubts about so many ameliorative social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the data tends to come from scholars on the Left . Typically they have been Marxists , Stephen Jay Gould of Harvard and Leon Kamin of Northeastern being among the more prominent . The single most hard-line statement against a genetic basis for IQ is still Not in Our Genes , a 1984 work by R. C. Lewontin , Steven Rose , and Leon Kamin , who posit that IQ studies are a weapon employed by the ruling class to hold down the poor and minorities , and who seem unable to discuss the human condition without dragging in Marx , Engels , Feuerbach , and " revolutionary philosophers and practitioners like Mao Tse-tung . " Kamin was one of the scholars turned to by the Boston Globe for its recent report on the Herrnstein - Murray book . He was quoted as stating that the book was " politics masquerading as science .
