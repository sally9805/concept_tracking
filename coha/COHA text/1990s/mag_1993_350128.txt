It 's beginning to look as if the stock market is at record highs for good reason . Uh-oh . Perversely , the market tends to perform best when people are scared and worst when things are finally beginning to look rosy . But consider the temptations : <P> The cold war is over , and we are the world 's only superpower . <P> It no longer looks as if we will all be working for the Japanese . <P> Peace is breaking out in the Middle East . <P> Oil prices are low . <P> South Africa 's black and white leaders have jointly won the Nobel Peace Prize . ( And those South African bonds I suggested here in May  --  up 25%  --  still yield 15% . ) <P> Interest rates are wonderfully low . <P> Balance sheets are growing stronger . <P> Economic growth is real , but slow enough not to rekindle inflation . <P> Trade is becoming freer  --  surely Congress will eventually pass NAFTA , as Presidents Clinton , Bush , Reagan , Carter , Ford and Nixon have all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been urging it to do . <P> Free enterprise is beginning to take hold in Russia and , more impressively , in China . <P> Technology races ahead  --  laser surgery , CD-ROM encyclopedias , fat-free cheese . It is , in short , an extraordinary time to be alive . <P> Which brings me to perhaps the most amazing development of all ( although I really ca n't get over this cheese ; it looks and tastes just like the regular kind ) : commission-free stock trading . As if all this other great stuff were n't reason enough to plop down your hard-earned bucks for shares of Snapple , up fivefold in the past 10 months , or Callaway Golf , up fourfold , now there are several ways to play the game on the supercheap . Stocks have become expensive , but the cost of buying them has come way down . It 's kind of like the free helicopter to the airport Pan Am used to provide when you bought a $4,000 first-class ticket . A bargain ! <P> Olde Discount Stockbrokers ( 800-USA-OLDE ) offers free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an account worth at least $500,000 to qualify ; but if you do , there 's no commission to pay . Zero ! ( How does Olde do it ? By charging commissions on all the other trades you do  --  such as bonds , options and over-the-counter trades . And by lending money to you on margin , loaning your securities out to short sellers , and perhaps even selling you an annuity or life-insurance policy one day . ) <P> Nor must you have $500,000 to get in on the fun . <P> Accutrade ( 800-882-4887 ) charges just 3 cents a share with a $48 minimum . So you could buy 1,600 shares of IBM for just a $48 commission . The same trade at a traditional discounter would cost about $230 . At Merrill Lynch : $750 . ( Except that at most full-service brokers , all you have to do to get a break on the commission is ask . A really active account may get 50% or 60% or even more off the official rates . ) I like Accutrade because you can punch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Touch-Tone phone or , more elegantly , from a home computer . ( If you have Windows , Accutrade 's free " plus term " utility makes your on-line sessions painless. )
