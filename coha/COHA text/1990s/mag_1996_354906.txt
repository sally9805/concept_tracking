Republicans are fretting over that ancient Freudian riddle  --  What do women want ?  --  while aiming programs at them called " A Seat at the Table " ( have n't they noticed many women are sitting there already ? ) , or designing cards with " Twelve Important Messages for Women " that can " fit in a man 's pocket and a woman 's purse , " in the words of one G.O.P. operative . Democrats too have launched a guerrilla operation to snag women in this election . But mostly the Democrats are smirking because they 're pretty sure that whatever women want , or will want in November , it does n't rhyme with " coal . " On both sides , men are rubbing their eyes and seeing Woman once again as inscrutable Other  --  bred in primordial tidal pools and probably subject to the phases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a gap . The overall trend for the past 20 years has been a shift to the right , which means men are the ones who have changed , while women have remained , on average , closer to where both sexes used to be : favoring , for example , the use of public resources for something other than the construction of prisons and bombs .

The age of first marriage for men has shot up to almost 27 , and after divorce it is the man who gets the bachelor pad and the woman who gets the playpen and potty seat . More than at any other time in the past 25 years , men are living in a state of radical disconnection from the women-and-children part of the human race . <P> Even when they are ensconced in a family , men are spending more of their time in a special guy world of their own . A decade or so ago , there was just baseball and football . Then came basketball , soccer , tennis , kick boxing and " ultimate fighting "  --  filling in every month of the year and every hour of the day on espn and its clones .

The masculine ideal of popular culture has long since ceased to be the man in the gray-flannel suit , trudging dutifully between office and home . It has become the millionaire hoop star with a stable of interchangeable gal pals , or the yuppie bachelor investing in his home wine cellar .
