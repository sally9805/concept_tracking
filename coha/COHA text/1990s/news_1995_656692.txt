<p> WHILE Americans watched Colin Powell come close to bidding for the presidency and then draw back , Russians were watching a former general of their own position himself as the most likely candidate to succeed Boris Yeltsin next year . And unlike General Powell , the charismatic Alexander Lebed seems to have no reverse gear . <p> The 15 percent Mr. Lebed garners in polls may not sound like much , but it puts him squarely in the lead . In a one-on-one race against Mr. Yeltsin 's prime minister , Viktor Chernomyrdin , he would take 31 percent versus Mr. Chernomyrdin 's 23 percent . Even the Communists ' popular candidate , Gennady Zyuganov , hints that he would be comfortable serving as prime minister in a coalition government should Lebed gain the presidency in next June 's balloting . <p> If electoral success hinges on the clarity and brevity of a candidate 's message , Lebed is a winner . The Russian press , friend and foe alike , agree that he speaks directly to Russia 's wounded pride . He supports the cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newly independent states ; he considers the collapse of the USSR a disaster and would like to renew the old links between Moscow and its neighbors ; he warns the expansion of NATO could lead to World War III ; he wants the government to regulate the economy more closely ; and , above all , he would declare war on crime and corruption . <p> No image problem here ! Lebed is the candidate of Russian patriotism , law , and order . <p> All this could spell trouble for the United States and Western Europe . A Lebed presidency could put at risk the two-year-old agreement on conventional weapons in Europe . It could force NATO to close ranks and rearm , at great cost to the US budget . Russian fears of foreign economic domination could lead to protectionist tariffs and taxes that would threaten billions in Western investments . And human rights violations by a zealous Lebed government could create the " Cold Peace " Yeltsin has warned of . <p> Is Lebed what he seems ? <p> Whether or not events take this gloomy course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he seems ? Are we reading him right ? Certainly much of his record lends support to grim prognostications . The 44-year-old Lebed was the USSR 's hatchet man for several of the worst acts of repression directed against restive non-Russian republics . A tough " special assignment " unit under his command resorted to chemical weapons and shovels to kill dozens of demonstrators in Tbilisi , Georgia , in 1988 . In 1990 , he carried out a Chechnya-like operation against Azerbaijanis seeking independence from Moscow . After being promoted to lead the 14th Army in Moldova , Lebed did everything in his power to undermine the new government there , often acting in defiance of his superiors in the Kremlin . He now claims he was really trying to prevent corrupt officers from selling off weapons to Middle Eastern terrorists . Later , when Yeltsin confronted a mutinous parliament , he sided with the president . But as he watched the once-proud Soviet Army collapse around him , Lebed became a bitter critic of Yeltsin 's new Russia . <p> If this were the whole picture , the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lebed and prepare for the worst . But it is not the whole picture . Part of Lebed 's appeal is that he is not a career politician . From the podium he often shoots from the hip . Yet he has also shown he is self-confident enough to revise his views in the face of evidence . <p> Take , for example , the Soviet operations in Georgia and Azerbaijan that he commanded . By March of this year he had concluded that these were both costly mistakes . " Everything we tried to hold onto by force was lost , " he rued . Lebed has also denounced Soviet intervention against Hungary in 1956 , Czechoslovakia in 1967 , and Lithuania in 1991 , not to mention Russia 's ongoing military assault on Chechnya , which he has criticized in no uncertain terms . One reason that then-Minister of Defense Boris Gromov sacked Lebed this spring was that he refused an order to lead Russian forces intervening in Tajikistan 's civil war . " Why should a Russian general help one group of Tajiks kill another group of Tajiks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has also sharply criticized Soviet rule in Central Europe . He considers the fall of the Berlin Wall to have been an " act of common sense . " <p> For all his Russia-first swagger , Lebed states that he is categorically opposed to the use of force in reassembling the former lands of the USSR . Indeed , he would cut the Army 's size and make it more professional , thus abandoning the cherished Soviet ideal of a mass army . <p> Lebed dreams of building a voluntary confederation by means of which Moscow would gradually reestablish its regional leadership . While this , too , presents serious problems to the sovereignty of the new states , especially Ukraine , Belarus , and Kazakstan , it does not differ greatly from the program long since advocated by Alexander Solzhenitsyn and what is already being pursued by the Yeltsin government , for that matter . <p> That Lebed would impose tough measures against crime and Russia 's " mafias " goes without saying . He also belongs squarely in the camp of those Russians most outraged by MPV , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine SPIB-Info , which boasts a million subscribers . <p> On these campaigns Lebed is to be faulted less for the ends he pursues than for waffling over the means he would employ . One day he sounds merely like a tough cop ; the next day he comes across like Pinochet at his worst . Lebed quickly grows impatient with the give and take of democracy , which endears him to those who think Russia needs a " strong hand " but sends chills up the spine of Russia 's freshly minted democrats . <p> An educational deficit <p> Yuri Skokov , leader of Lebed 's party , the Congress of Russian Communities ( KRO ) , has every reason to cheer his popular standard bearer . Yet last summer he was quoted in the Russian press as saying that Lebed " does not have enough education . " This is particularly true in economics , a subject on which the usually voluble former officer is conspicuously silent . Beyond ritual attacks on Yeltsin 's " shock therapy " and on a privatization process that enriched thousands of totally unworthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeltsin named Chernomyrdin prime minister , Western observers were quick to write off reform in Russia . After all , how could the manager of one of the USSR 's biggest state monopolies support privatization ? Yet Chernomyrdin proved a quick study and reform went forward . Besides his own intelligence , he benefited from extensive contact with businesspeople and political leaders from the major industrial democracies , including the United States . <p> Lebed is already being written off by many in the West as a chauvinistic blowhard with a macho past and dangerous intentions in the present . But he has had the guts to rethink his position on many issues . Moreover , he is bright . He is a far cry from Vladimir Zhirinovsky , the populist buffoon who championed the cause of Russia 's wounded pride in last year 's Duma elections . <p> Russian leaders face new situations daily . They must feel their way , learning as they go . Inevitably , their views evolve as they confront the challenge of leadership . Lebed wants to be a strong leader and knows that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business leaders , journalists , politicians , and civic activists can and should be an important part of that learning process . <p> In his day , Ronald Reagan reached out to an unknown Mikhail Gorbachev , George Bush made contact with Yeltsin , and now Al Gore meets regularly with Chernomyrdin . Scores of American businesspeople and civic leaders have done the same . Such contact should not be withheld from Alexander Lebed , the candidate most likely to succeed Yeltsin as Russia 's president .
