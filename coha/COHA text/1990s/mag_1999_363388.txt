STARRING : Al Pacino , Dennis Quaid , Jamie Foxx , Cameron Diaz DIRECTOR : Oliver Stone OPENS : Dec. 22 <P> Basically , it 's your mean , very mean , standard sports story : an aging coach ( Pacino ) who is on a losing streak ; a great veteran quarterback ( Quaid ) whose winning spirit has gone south ; a cocky kid ( Foxx ) who needs some life lessons before he can step into the starter 's shoes . The up-to-date spin on this tale is provided by the tough and scheming owner ( Diaz ) , who has inherited the team , the Miami Sharks , from her more benign father and wreaks a certain amount of nontraditional havoc before she gets some sort of comeuppance . <P> Director Oliver Stone , who wrote Any Given Sunday 's screenplay with John Logan , may be momentarily in a nonpolitical mood , but that does not mean he has given up his preoccupations with paranoia , greed and the brutality of American life . He sees his warriors as innocent animals , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corruption by people trying to make a buck off their pain . Or , in the case of a particularly noxious sports reporter ( John C. McGinley ) , a know-nothing who thinks he knows it all , just trying to make a name for himself . <P> McGinley 's relationship to the game is interesting . So is Lauren Holly 's with the crippled quarterback , finally letting the inner bitch residing beneath her cool jock's-wife beauty savagely surface . The trouble with the movie is its style , all handheld shots and short , jagged cuts . They 're supposed to represent the barely controlled anarchy of the sport ( and to let Stone touch on far too many narrative points ) . But almost three hours of this jitter deteriorates from bravura filmmaking to annoying mannerism , and Any Given Sunday ends up less than the sum of its many , often interesting parts . <P>  --  R.S.
