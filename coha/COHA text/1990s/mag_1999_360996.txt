Chow Yun-fat , the epitome of swaggering suavity in John Woo 's Hong Kong crime films , wears his role as a good-bad cop dapperly in this good-middling drama set in Manhattan 's Chinatown . He 's the tough guy teaming with Mark Wahlberg 's sweetly anguished type to battle a local triad . Foley ( After Dark , My Sweet ) , who choreographs the snazziest New York car chase since The French Connection , specializes in close-up portraits of people sweating on the inside . But no matter how dank the moral dilemma , Chow will never break a sweat . In Hong Kong or New York , he 's just too cool . <P>  --  R.C.
