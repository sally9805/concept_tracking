LIBERALISM 'S SECOND CHANCE . <p> The crushing defeat of the Democrats creates the best opportunity in a quarter-century for liberalism . By liberalism , of course , I mean the liberalism of the New Deal and the original , color-blind civil rights revolution , the liberalism of FDR and Truman and LBJ , of Martin Luther King Jr . and Bayard Rustin . This liberalism buckled at Chicago in 1968 under the weight of a coalition of left-liberal , upper-income radicals and black-power militants . These progressive-liberals alienated a growing number of once-Democratic white middle-class Americans , who floated for a generation between the two parties . On the presidential level , they soon came to live in sin with the Republicans . On November 8 , they married them . <p> The shock to the Democratic Party should be seismic . Democrats may one day regain Congress , but they will be different Democrats . Even those Democrats who lost on November 8 resembled tough-on-crime , socially conservative , anti-Washington Republicans more than their party elites . Progressive-liberals , with their odd mix of patronizing liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bribery by means of proliferating entitlements , have gone the way of the Whigs and the Mugwumps and the Free Silverites . <p> They deserve their fate . And they deserve little consolation . Some have blamed the Democratic collapse on the end of the cold war . Having lost an enemy , it is argued , angry voters are now seeking substitutes : the poor , blacks , immigrants . This is only half right . Not the half about American domestic politics having been primarily about foreign policy during the cold war ( it was n't ) , but the half about the importance of the cold war 's end . One by one , since the Soviet Union imploded , the dominant parties in the democracies have been blown to smithereens by populist and nationalist electorates : the Social Democrats in Sweden , the Christian Democrats in Italy , the Socialists in France , the Liberal Democratic Party in Japan , the Progressive Conservatives in Canada . And now the Democrats . Their turn might have come earlier had our divided government not caused a Republican president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the factor uniting these demolitions was not the effect of the cold war 's end on the right  --  the search for enemies  --  but the effect of the cold war 's end on the left  --  its marginalization . For half a century in the democracies , " the left " was socialism and " the right " was free-market , business-class conservatism ( illiberal populist and fascist conservatism having been discredited by World War II ) . In this scheme , " the center " was composed of social democrats ( in Europe ) and progressive-liberals ( in the United States ) . <p> But the Soviet collapse and the Chinese abandonment of communism discredited socialism , no matter what democratic socialists may say . This caused a global shift in the definitions of the politically relevant left , right and center . All of a sudden , the social democrats and progressive-liberals , to their horror , discovered they were no longer the moderate " center , " but the left-wing extreme . Yesterday 's liberal conservatives , formerly the right , are now the mainstream . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pre-1945 national traditions : neo-fascism in Italy , fundamentalism , nativism and eugenics in the United States . <p> Some centrist parties , like Helmut Kohl 's Christian Democrats , have maintained their pivotal role by taking a few giant steps to the right , putting out more flags and taking in fewer immigrants . Clinton did his best to chase the rightward-drifting center . Remember , this was the most conservative Democratic president since Grover Cleveland . This was the Democrat who denounced Sister Souljah and called for boot camps for youth offenders and put his humiliation of labor in the NAFTA debate at the top of his resume . <p> Indeed , Clinton 's stillborn neoliberalism looked much like the emerging Republican consensus . This consensus , devised by trial and error in campaigns like that of New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman , eclectically combined pro-choice ( and in some cases pro-gay rights ) attitudes with pro-family rhetoric ; tax cuts and a crackdown on welfare ; reinventing government and free trade . Riordan , Giuliani , Weld  --  all won big on this agenda . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gay-bashing . <p> Clinton 's apologists argue that Clinton made this " centrist " move and still got clobbered . They point to deficit reduction , NAFTA and so on to buttress their case . But they ignore one critical issue : race . Since the 1960s the Democratic Party has been the party of racial preferences for nonwhites . Not only have Democrats extended racial preference to new areas in every decade  --  busing in the ' 70s , college quotas and race-norming on tests in the ' 80s , racial gerrymandering of congressional districts in the ' 90s  --  but they have extended the racial spoils system to ever more groups . The most important of these is the so-called Hispanic population , a diverse group whose members never suffered from the kind of legal ( as opposed to social ) apartheid inflicted on blacks , Native Americans and West Coast Asian Americans . Despite his campaign posturing , Clinton did nothing decisive in office to reverse this impression . Quite the contrary . <p> Democratic strategists hoped they could lure alienated white voters home without offending the black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could buy white acquiescence in ever-escalating racial preferences by means of a bribe : generous , universal entitlements for the white majority , like health care . But they failed to deliver health care . What they did deliver was Deval Patrick , arguing on behalf of the Clinton Justice Department that the law permits firing white teachers simply because they are white . This hubris has ironically produced its nemesis in the elevation of Strom Thurmond , the 1948 presidential candidate of the white supremacist Dixiecrat Party , to the chairmanship of the Senate Armed Services Committee . <p> Then there is the other wedge issue : immigration . Immigration is a factor in the equation because nonwhite immigrants ( i.e. , the majority ) are eligible , under the laws the Democrats made , for affirmative action benefits denied to whites , either native-born or naturalized . Alarm about Third World immigration , of course , is prompting all First World democracies to move toward strict restrictionist regimes . Only in the United States , thanks to progressive-liberals , are immigrants eligible to participate in a racial spoils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dominant concern except in California . But the California experience provides the best illustration of why progressive-liberalism died . In his campaign against Proposition 187 , President Clinton argued , on the basis of a single court case , that the children of illegal immigrants , instead of being deported along with their law-breaking parents , should be educated at taxpayer expense . There is not a democracy in the world in which a party advocating free public services for foreigners would not be obliterated at the polls . Progressive-liberalism came to power in the Democratic Party during the riotous ' 68 Convention , as the inheritors of the party on the Chicago streets burned the Stars and Stripes . The end may have come in Los Angeles , when a crowd that had been assembled to denounce Proposition 187 waved flags bearing the eagle and serpent of Mexico . <p> The demise of the progressive-liberals does not give the Republicans a mandate ( except , perhaps , to reduce immigration ) . At the moment , the Republicans have merely captured the center of American politics  --  the anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class as well as the rich . The haves possess no program , except possession . Reagan discovered that no middle-class entitlements can be cut ; Clinton discovered that no new entitlements that would appear to benefit groups other than middle-class Americans ( such as universal health care ) can be created . Just as the haves are fortifying their neighborhoods , turning the cheerful suburbs of the ' 60s into the armed enclaves of the ' 90s , so they are barricading themselves in with their FDR-to-Johnson subsidies . They will execute every prisoner and throw every unwed mother into prostitution before they accept cuts in Social Security , housing subsidies or student loans . They are the New Dealers from hell . <p> Unlike the fragile Republican majority , this pattern is part of the deep structure of American politics for the foreseeable future . It leaves difficult options for the Democrats . The party might come back by retooling itself as a second Republican party : me-too , dime-store liberal conservatives . Or it can return to real liberalism , in the form of new liberal nationalism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin with the proposition that America is a transracial nation-state , not a congeries of separate racial " cultures " held to varying standards and eligible for varying benefits . Reviving the color-blind idealism of the ' 60s , liberal nationalists would lead the fight to dismantle not only racial preferences but the archaic system of pseudo-scientific racial labeling  --  for the best liberal reasons . <p> In its fascination with social engineering , progressive-liberalism neglected the more fundamental tasks of economic policy and the core of national security and personal safety . Liberal nationalists would reverse the priorities : national military strength , controlled borders and safe and well-policed streets would come first , followed by pragmatic state intervention in the economy to protect and raise wages and living standards for the wage-earning majority . The liberal nationalist kind of social engineering , instead of focusing on allocating Cabinet seats on the basis of race and gender , would take the form of a war on oligarchy . The goal would be to identify and eliminate hidden and not-so-hidden class privileges . <p> This strategy would co-opt many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bluff on the question of paying for them . Want to balance the budget ? Sure  --  we 'd rather finance a state-of-the-art military through income taxes on the rich anyway . Want to cut back on immigration ? A steep tax on nannies could help defray the costs . Let the rich raise their own children , like the rest of us . Crack down on crime ? Fine  --  but let 's tax private security services to give the rich an incentive to pay their fair share of taxes for the metropolitan police . Replace welfare with workfare ? O.K. We 're willing to create a couple of million public-sector jobs . Are you ? Reform Congress ? Let 's start by outlawing political action committee contributions to Republican committee chairs . And while we 're at it , let 's outlaw lobbying on behalf of foreign governments and corporations by ex-officials . Are you still with us , guys ? <p> Liberal nationalism , like its New Deal predecessor , would be tax-and-spend liberalism  --  tax the affluent and spend on the wage earners . The market can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incomes that the market is causing in the first place . It is probably no accident that income inequality in the United States steadily declined between 1929 and 1969  --  the era of the redistributionist , pro-labor New Deal liberal coalition  --  and has steadily increased again in the era of Republican and conservative Democratic presidents . Nor , probably , is it a coincidence that American capitalism boomed when public investment  --  the Pentagon , the highway system  --  was at its highest levels . When it worked for most Americans , the market had a lot of help . <p> Needless to say , a new liberal economic strategy requires Democratic politicians who do n't depend for their advice , their personnel or their campaign funds on Goldman , Sachs . The next generation of liberals will need to learn once again how to wage class war . Some say class war ca n't work in the United States . Nonsense . Only the populist Democrats  --  FDR , Truman , Johnson  --  have succeeded and reshaped America ; the conservatives  --  Cleveland , Kennedy , Carter , Clinton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans that the state is their enemy can be reduced by the replacement of race-based programs with entitlements that are universal or means-tested ( why should the rich get tax breaks on their mansion mortgages ? ) . We can count on the Republicans to make it easier for their corporate sponsors to keep slashing wages and benefits , busting unions , replacing full-time workers with temps , demanding overtime . The Republicans , in short , will make it safe for the new liberals to wage class war . Just give them a few years in power . <p> Let the Republicans celebrate . We liberals of the next generation might even join them . After all , in killing progressive-liberalism , Gingrich , Gramm and company have now made room for real liberalism .
