How do independent garden centers compete with the big boys ? It comes down to variety , service , and the personal touch . Photograph Blue Moon 's Sharon Lee Smith and Mary Wilhite cultivate a relaxed family atmosphere near Tyler , Texas . // They 're the places your dad took you to buy the magnolia that blooms right outside your window . They 're the places that introduced you to more azaleas , roses , and bulbs than you ever dreamed existed . They 're where your mom went to have someone identify that nasty caterpillar devouring her petunias . They 're the South 's independent garden centers . The good news is , they still thrive today . How do they do it ? How do these mom-and-pop operations compete with national chains , million-dollar advertising budgets , and prices that are lower than a gopher 's wine cellar ? Answer-by supplying the things that the big chains ca n't . To see a great example , drive 15 miles west of Tyler , Texas , and visit Blue Moon Gardens near Chandler . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods where Sharon Lee Smith and Mary Wilhite set up shop in 1984 . At first , they specialized in potted herbs . But in 1992 , they bought the 85-year-old farmhouse next door and opened a retail garden center . Replete with herbs , vines , perennials , heirloom roses , and Texas native plants , it features an intimate and quirky display garden that feels like your aunt 's front yard . The relaxed family atmosphere draws customers from afar . " You have to go out of your way to get to us , " admits Mary . " A lot of folks drive here from Dallas or Shreveport just for the country experience . They 'll hang around , bring picnic lunches , and walk through the garden . Our display beds are also trial gardens-they show the way plants actually perform . " Birdhouses , wind chimes , pottery , and ornamental iron handmade by Texas artisans decorate the plantings . " We always buy locally if we can , " she says . " That way , Sharon and I know the artists and can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch " In northern Florida , Tallahassee Nurseries has been helping gardeners achieve success since 1938 . Gene Ellis , a current owner , took over from his mother and dad in 1964 . Over the past quarter-century , his business has grown with the rest of the booming Sunbelt . " We used to be out in the country , and now we 're not , " he notes . " This whole town just grew up around us . " Key to the nursery 's success , he feels , is an unchanging focus on quality plants . " Big chains do a good job with fertilizers and chemicals , " he explains . " But what saves us is that we deal in plants that are regional . What grows in Seattle wo n't grow in Tallahassee . " Are Southern gardeners becoming more sophisticated ? " Definitely ! " Gene replies . " Thirty years ago , we 'd have thousands of redtips , azaleas , and shore junipers on display . Now , the most of anything we 'll display may be 20 to 25 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keeping up with the newest plants and answering customers ' questions demand a staff of trained horticulturists , many of whom have been with Gene more than a decade . " Everybody who works here knows and loves plants , " he says . In Griffin , Georgia , paying a call on The Greenery seems like dropping in on " The Yard of the Month . " Trees , shrubs , grass , and perennials embrace the wideporched house that serves as a gift shop . A few yards away sits the brick home of Jim and Lynn Mock , who run the nursery with their daughter , Rebecca . They 'll forgive you if you overlook the house in favor of the spectacular rose and perennial garden sitting in front of it . The garden is such a hit with customers that many get married there . Photograph Quality plants and highly trained staff are key at Tallahassee Nurseries in Florida , says owner Gene Ellis ( in red shirt ) . // Things were n't quite so rosy when the Mocks started out with a single plastic greenhouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stare of a reptile , killed most of their plants . Yet the Mocks persevered . " When you love landscaping , as Jim and I do , you stick with it , " explains Lynn . " Jim 's motto is , As long as you do n't quit , you 'll never fail . ' " Today , loyal customers celebrate the Mocks ' success . Many make the hour 's trip south from Atlanta to peruse an outstanding selection of perennials , herbs , trees , shrubs , silk flowers , and garden furniture . " We cater to our customers , " Lynn says proudly . " They can bring in their empty planters and pots , and we 'll plant them up and have them ready to go . We 'll even make house calls . " Being able to help customers choose the right plants and answer their questions is another plus . " We view it as a calling , " she says . " If we have the knowledge , it 's our duty to share it and help people be successful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants too . Natchez Trace Gardens has a lot to do with that . Its expansive greenhouse range appears incongruous in a city of about 7,000 , but the high quality and extensive variety of homegrown perennials , hanging baskets , poinsettias , and other plants lures customers from as far away as Jackson and Memphis . Many cities 10 times as large ca n't boast of a garden center like this one . According to co-owners Mark Terkanian and Lori Hitchcock , growing most of the plants themselves is a big advantage . " If there 's a new , hot plant that people want , we can grow it , " says Lori . And they 'll order plants they do n't grow . " If someone 's looking for a special tree , I 'll order a dozen . When you offer that kind of service , word travels fast . " If there 's one drawback to running your own garden center , it 's that you 're always on call . But owners like Lynn Mock take it in stride . " Sometimes I 'm torn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention , " she concedes . " But if you think about how many people you 're making happy , it makes it all worth it .
