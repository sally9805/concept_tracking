Section : NATIONAL AFFAIRS Cops are getting out of their cruisers and into the community , looking to be the good guys on the block <p> If New York police Sgt. Andrew McGoey were conducting business as usual , it would probably mean cruising Brooklyn 's Sunset Park neighborhood in his patrol car listening for calls on the radio and waiting for trouble in an area plagued by drug dealing and prostitution . It might mean jumping from his car to make an arrest and shoving the suspect into his back seat for a ride down to the station house . <p> But instead of muggers and drug dealers , Sergeant McGoey has been driving around lately with sweet old ladies in the back of his van . Each week McGoey and his officers take three dozen elderly women from nursing homes on shopping expeditions . Their aim is to protect the ladies from muggers who might prey on their large black pocketbooks . McGoey 's men also provided nighttime lighting for a schoolyard , the better to drive away heroin addicts who left their needles and feces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenants and enlist landlords to evict drug dealers . " Instead of issuing summons or filling out crime reports , we look for solutions , " says McGoey . <p> Across the country , police officers like McGoey are drawing a new blue line in the war against crime . It 's called community policing , abuzz phrase encompassing several ideas with a single goal : putting cops back on the street and into partnership with citizens to stop crime before it happens . More than 300 cities , scrambling to stem a tide of drugs and violence , are trying it in some form . Charleston , S.C. , officers have fielded " flying squads " to confront drug dealers on the streets . Houston police visit homes in high-crime areas to teach security measures . Los Angeles cops walk beats from substations in MacArthur Park to deter crime . New York , rocked by a summer of violence-including the deaths of four children from straybullets-will add 1,058 new officers to its community-police program . Can any of these new initiatives actually reduce crime ? No one knows yet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , response and arrest-are not working . Community policing offers a new approach . " It is the wave of the future , " says Baltimore County Police Chief Neil Behan . " It 's no longer doing things to the public or for the public , but with the public . " <p> Walking the beat : Walking the beat is. of course , an old idea . Before World War II , the cop on the corner was a neighborhood fixture . He knew the players on his streets-the merchants , the residents and the troublemakers . He was in sync with the daily rhythms of community life , able to tell whether the light in the back of the store at night meant the weekly poker game or trouble . Familiarity bred other problems , however , like corruption and cronyism . The push for professionalism put cops in radio cars to roam larger areas and shield them from temptation . The model was Joe Friday 's detached efficiency , a mode of operation that sought " just the facts , ma'am . " But life behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the communities they took an oath to protect . Manpower shortages and waves of crime have turned most big-city cops into reactive figures who show up only after trouble has started , sometimes triggering resentment for their remote , disinterested style . <p> By making cops a highly visible part of street life again , community policing can re-establish ties that have frayed . This takes time and patience , to be sure . Police in Sunset Park got skeptical looks when they started ringing doorbells and dropping into stores six years ago to introduce the city 's Community Patrol Officers Program ( CPOP ) . But as they became familiar figures , residents began providing tips about the crack trade on 61st Street , telling police that dealers hid their merchandise in garbage cans when police were nearby . One night cops came through with a garbage truck and swept the drugs away with the trash . When dealers switched to other modes of storage-like placing magnetized plastic bags under cars-residents continued to inform . While some drug sales persist after dark , the day trade has been driven away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a small victory in the bigger war , but a significant one for Sunset Park . <p> With a premium on problem-solving and deterrence rather than arrests , community policing can also mean a respite for overloaded courts and jails . Many law enforcers agree that " collars " are not the answer . " You do n't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out that arrests are not a solution to I crime , " says Philadelphia police Inspector l Edward McLaughlin . In his city , jails are so overcrowded that all but hard-core criminals are sprung almost as soon as they get to the station house . Forcing cops to stand down from making arrests and writing summonses has given some a new perspective and helped them bridge cultural gaps . In predominantly Hispanic Sunset Park , for example , residents do n't consider street-corner beer drinking and domino games a problem . " We let them tell us what the problems are , " says Sergeant McGoey . <p> Cops at risk : Not everyone buys into the new approach . Cops in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea could take years in many departments . " What you 're talking about is nothing less than a cultural revolution in policing , " says Robert Kendrick , a criminal-justice expert at the University of Houston . Leery cops see a scheme that is more public relations than public safety . They fear that easing up on arrests is a signal to crooks that they wo n't pay a price for their misdeeds . Ultimately , some cops believe , such leniency places them at risk . It could also place citizens at risk . With its emphasis on collaboration with police , the community approach could leave residents of high-crime areas vulnerable to retaliation from drug dealers . Threats of violence have kept some members of a New Haven anticrime group from staying actively involved in a community-policing project . Others suggest that walking the beat does little to diminish root causes of crime like drug addiction and joblessness . " Just because you drive a drug dealer off the street corner , do you think he 's going to get a job at IBM ? " asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Criminal Justice in New York . <p> Community policing is also labor intensive , which means it 's expensive . New York 's plan to place CPOP teams in each of the city 's 14 highest-crime precincts will cost $90 million through 1992 . New York Police Commissioner Lee Brown pioneered community programs in the mid-1980s while serving in Houston . Although these programs have gained the acceptance of initially skeptical officers , tight budgets have sharply limited their growth . Most cities would have to cut back on other traditional-and politically popular-services to make community policing work . Fewer cops in patrol cars mean longer response times to 911 calls and fewer high-profile operations like drug stings . <p> There are other obstacles as well . Spiraling crime and racial tension have poisoned police-community relations in some cities . Many inner-city residents see cops as infantry from an occupying army rather than guarantors of public safety . That 's not likely to change until metropolitan police forces accurately reflect the racial compositions of the cities they protect . In Miami , a foot-patrol program called Back to Basics has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the predominantly Cuban force and Haitian and African-American citizens will make community policing difficult . A Haitian protest against a Cuban shop owner last month landed 14 demonstrators in the hospital after a clash with police . " The conditions of the urban minority community do not lend themselves to utopian relations with the police , " says Max Castro of Greater Miami United , an organization working to improve race relations . <p> Community policing is certainly no one 's idea of Utopia . It wo n't eliminate drug addiction , racial strife or the grotesque violence chronicled in big-city newspapers everyday . At best , it may only be able to help a handful of fear-ridden communities regain the security of its homes and streets . But that alone would be no mean feat . A Welcome Presence <p> Community policing is the catch phrase for a number of programs aimed at getting police officers and citizens to join forces in deterring crime . Its key components are : <p> High visibility : Rather than cruise in squad cars , police establish a high-profile presence in a neighborhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Cops try to develop relationships with merchants and residents , establishing ties that eventually lead to sharing tips that can prevent crime . <p> Fewer arrests : The idea is to prevent drug dealing and violent crime , not just to react after the fact . <p> Decentralized authority : Cops on the beat have more autonomy to solve problems . They work out of neighborhood mini-stations rather than large precinct houses . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : An occupying army : Traditional methods can alienate residents from police <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Small victories in a larger war : Officers and kids Jump rope on Brooklyn 's 61st Street , a block once plague by drug dealers <p> By BILL TORQUE with BOB COHN in Washington , ANNE UNDERWOOD in New York and bureau reports BOB COHN in New Haven <p>
