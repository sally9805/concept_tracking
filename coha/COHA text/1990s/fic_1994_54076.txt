I CUT OUT OF MY TRIG class twenty minutes early on Wednesday to make the meeting of the " Powers of Witchcraft " series at the Pagan Church . I hated to leave because Dr. Lufkin was explaining the Hartford algorithm and talking about its development process , which was fascinating . Plus Dr. L. gave me a disappointed look as I left , which made me feel bad . He 's a great prof . <p> Anyway , I left , and twenty minutes should have been plenty of time to make it to the seminar , except Mr. Brown would n't start . Mr. Brown is my car . He 's a 1969 VW fastback with a sunroof and a dark bronze-brown paint job , which is how he got his name . <p> My father still has n't reconciled himself to me buying Mr. Brown instead of the seven-year-old Toyota he had all picked out for me . But the second I walked onto that used-car lot and saw Mr. Brown , with that dent in his fender that looked just like a dimple in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me . The way I look at it , I worked two summers to save the money , and it was going to be my car , not Dad 's . Mr. Brown may not be as new as that Toyota was , but he 's got character . <p> On the Wednesday in question , he was displaying more than usual . I got in , flung my backpack in the passenger seat , and prepared myself for the ritual by clearing my mind , taking deep breaths , and opening myself to the inner light . Then , when I was certain my aura was clear , I inserted the key in the ignition , pumped the accelerator three and one-fourth times , and turned the key . <p> This works every time , if I 've really found inner stillness . I guess I had n't because Mr. Brown gave a long soggy cough and nothing more . I tried again . No dice . <p> A guy with short kinky black hair and a kind of goofy-looking shy grin stopped next to Mr. Brown . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Excuse me , miss . Maybe I can help ? " <p> I was about to explain that conversations distracted me from cleansing my aura , when he added , " Sounds to me like one of your spark-plug wires has worked loose . " <p> Mr. Brown had sounded funny . I got out . " Hey , you might be right , " I said , opening the trunk and checking the connections . One of the rubber connector caps at the end of a wire was cracked and was n't seated tightly . " How 'd you guess ? " <p> The guy got a little pink . " I work on cars . It 's how I 'm putting myself through school . VW 's are my specialty . " <p> I held out a hand . " I 'm Angie , " I said . " Thanks for the suggestion . " <p> He shook my hand . " Ray Cooper . This is a really nice little fastback you got here . " <p> " Thanks , Ray , " I said . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mr. Brown is one of my favorite people . Hey , I do n't mean to be rude , but I 'm late for a meeting . Thanks again . " <p> " Sure , " he said . He opened the door for me , which surprised me a little . He closed Mr. Brown 's door gently , with just the right amount of lift at the end to get it to shut securely . " See you , Angie , " he said . <p> " See you . " I did n't go through the whole aura thing with him standing there , but Mr. Brown purred like a big tabby when I turned the key . <p> I was only fifteen minutes late to the seminar . <p> Keith was waiting at the back of the church auditorium ( they rent the building from a bookstore that went bust , so the auditorium 's not very big ) , tapping his foot . " Angie , " he hissed as soon as he saw me , " I told you , twelve sharp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met : he 's got big gray-blue eyes and long dark hair that looks like Dennis Miller 's . He 's also the one who turned me on to the witchcraft series at the church , which was very nice of him . " Sorry , Keith , " I whispered . <p> We made our way to the seats in the third row he had held with his notebook and sweater . The woman at the end of the aisle gave me an assessing look as we climbed over her  --  I figured she was wondering how attached Keith was to me and maybe whether she could lay a hex to get rid of me . I dragged my backpack over her knees and smiled apologetically . <p> Today 's topic was " Finding Your Familiar , " and Keith already had his notebook out and was scribbling notes . I got mine out of my pack too . <p> The lecturer stood on a small stage with blue velvet curtains . She was a heavyset woman who had very straight , very long black hair and bangs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the collar and hem . <p> "  --  familiar is a very important part of developing your powers as a witch , " she was saying . They must have started late , because it did n't sound as if we 'd missed much . " Truthfully , in most cases , witches do n't really come into their powers until they have three things : a familiar , a personal grimoire , and membership in a coven . " <p> I made a note . I 'd been working on my book of spells for almost three years , and Keith was going to propose me for membership in his coven when Sharon Silversmith transferred to Omaha next month . It sounded like all I had to do now was find my familiar . <p> " What 's her name ? " I whispered to Keith . <p> He frowned . " I told you , " he said under his breath . " Karina . She 's the priestess of my coven . " <p> " Oh , " I said . <p> " In the course of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at many factors of importance to a witch 's power , but few are more important than finding the right familiar . A familiar acts as a guide and protects the witch , and sometimes may perform magic services for her . " She paused , and added with a smile at Keith , " Or him . " <p> Keith jiggled in his seat a little and smiled back at her . <p> " The uninitiated often think the familiar is just an animal , but it is actually a spirit which is sometimes embodied in an animal . In other words , the spirit may manifest on this plane as a cat or a salamander , but it is in actuality a denizen of another plane . It just takes a preferred shape in its service to us on this side . Is that clear ? " <p> I leaned over to Keith , who smelled strongly of rosemary oil , which made me wonder what kind of protective spells he 'd been doing . " Is a familiar 's service voluntary ? " <p> " Hush , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of you here attempt to capture and embody a familiar spirit , you should first look around you to see whether one has come to you voluntarily . Given the correct controls , a captured familiar will behave quite well , but a spirit that serves you of its own accord is better . My own familiar , the Spirit Androcles , serves me as a means to bring light to the earthly plane . He feels that I will manifest his message to many , which is why he has chosen to ally himself with me in this lifetime . " She gestured toward one side of the stage . <p> An enormous Siamese tomcat stalked onto the stage . He paused , surveying the audience contemptuously for a moment before he leaped up to the lecturn and balanced on one side of it . He looked straight at me , and I sneezed . People around us turned to look at me . I have kind of a loud sneeze . The cat blinked , and I sneezed again . Seeming satisfied with that , he looked down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tissue out of my backpack and blew my nose . <p> Keith leaned over , the smell of rosemary stronger than ever . I sneezed again . " What 's wrong with you ? " Keith asked . <p> " I'b allergig to cads , " I said . <p> " Are you ? " He frowned . " He 's at least ten feet away . " <p> " I dow , " I said . <p> Karina was saying , "  --  Androcles does many things for me . He warns me of danger from malicious spirits and often helps me select students of exceptional talent for advanced work . For example , it was Androcles who pointed out Keith Henderson as someone with particularly powerful , if untutored , psychic powers . Keith , stand up . " <p> Keith did . Androcles looked at me again , and I sneezed . <p> " Why , I believe Androcles is telling me something right now , " Karina said . " What 's your name ? " She pointed to me . <p> " Adgie , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , you must come to a discussion meeting very soon , Angie , " Karina said . " Now , let 's talk about how you 'll know when a familiar spirit has been drawn to you . Let me tell you how I knew that Androcles was more than just a cat . " <p> Androcles stopped licking his paw and assumed a regal position on the podium , head erect , tail neatly curled around his body . <p> " Thad cad bust weigh fordy pouds , " I whispered to Keith . <p> " Shush ! " he hissed . <p> " Almost seven years ago , " Karina said , " a cat came to my back door one day . She would n't leave , so we adopted each other . A few weeks later , she gave birth to three kittens . " She paused dramatically . <p> " Both the mama and two of the kittens died . Only one kitten survived , and I had to hand-feed him until he was old enough to lap . And as soon as Androcles was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which we were together . " <p> She folded her hands on the podium and leaned forward confidingly . Androcles flicked his tail , once up , once down , as if he wanted to make sure we were paying attention . " I was an Egyptian princess in a past life , " Karina said , " and Egyptian nobility were guarded by sacred lions . After Androcles was born , I began having dreams of Egypt , where I would walk with my hand on the head of a lion . That lion was Androcles , and he has come to me again in this lifetime to fulfill the same role : that of protector and guide . " <p> Karina lifted her hand , and I saw a large ruby wink in the light . She laid her hand on Androcles ' head . " If you go to pick out a pet , and the second you see the litter , you say to yourself , ' That 's the one for me , ' you 've probably found your familiar . " <p> She bowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands to ask questions , but Androcles jumped down from the podium and exited through the wings . Karina was right behind him . <p> Keith turned to me , his eyes alight with excitement , which made my heart flutter . " Is n't she marvelous ? " he said . <p> " Why , yes , " I said . " It was a very interesting lecture . " Privately , I considered Dr. L. 's to have been better , but I knew Keith was n't interested in algorithms . <p> " She said you should come to our next discussion meeting , " he said . " I think she was given a message for you . " <p> " Good , " I said . " Maybe it 'll be about how to find my familiar . I 'm doing the other things she talked about  --  my rituals are working . But I 'd really like to find my familiar . And join your coven , of course . " <p> He nodded seriously . " Yes , a familiar is important  --  a sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the All . " <p> " So when 's the next discussion group ? " I asked . <p> " Tomorrow night , at Karina 's house . Why do n't you pick me up at 6:30 , and I 'll show you where she lives ? " <p> " That sounds wonderful , Keith , " I said . I was already wondering what I should wear . <p> I DECIDED ON a pair of black leggings with a long emerald-green tunic that had black embroidery around the cuffs and collar ( taking a leaf from Karina 's book ) . I wore my black boots and did my hair big . Frankly , I looked pretty hot . <p> Blowing my hair dry had taken longer than usual , so it was a little after six when I grabbed my bag and my car keys and headed out the door . Mr. Brown sat in the driveway , the sickle-shaped dimple in his fender looking jauntier than ever . I gave him a loving pat as I went by . <p> Since I 'd just gotten out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more cleansing . I stuck the key in and cranked . Mr. Brown started right up . He 'd been humming along real happily ever since I 'd jiggled his wires the day before . <p> We backed out of the driveway and headed north , toward Keith 's apartment . I was feeling so good , I started to sing a little , an old tune , " Age of Aquarius . " Mr. Brown rattled a bit , adding great percussion . We jammed all the way to Keith 's . <p> It was right at 6:30 so I just pulled up by the curb and gave a little toodle on the horn . Keith came out of the building right away , looking better than ever . <p> " Hi , " he said , smiling at me as he tried to open the passenger door . He gave it a good yank , but it was stuck or something and would n't open . <p> I leaned across and hammered on the doorframe with my fist . " C'm on , Mr. Brown , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " On the third punch , the door gave suddenly . The upper corner caught Keith right above the eye . <p> " Ow ! " He touched his eyebrow gingerly . " That really hurts , " he said . <p> " Gee , I 'm sorry , Keith . The door 's never gotten stuck like that before . You want to go back in and get some ice for it ? " <p> He got in and sat down . " No , I do n't want you to be late to Karina 's meeting . This is a big honor for you , to be invited so soon . And it 'll be a chance for you to meet the other members of the coven . " <p> " Wonderful ! I 'm really sorry about your eye . " <p> He robbed it gently . " It 'll be O.K. I just hope it does n't turn black . " He gave me directions , and we got to Karina 's house right on time . <p> She had a medium-sized house in a nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a little shaggier than the neighbors ' . But otherwise it looked like an ordinary house . When I said something to Keith about it , he said , " What did you expect ? Gingerbread ? " <p> At first I thought he was talking about Victorian trim . Then I got it and laughed . " Do n't be silly . I guess I thought it would look more mysterious , is all . " <p> " Wait till you see inside , " he said . <p> Inside was pretty unusual . Karina 's living room was painted midnight blue  --  walls , ceiling , and the hardwood floor . Glow-in-the-dark stars glimmered on the ceiling , and a frosted white globe hung from a silver chain in the center . A silver pentagram in a golden circle was painted on the blue floor . No furniture , just large blue cushions piled around the comers outside the pentagram . About a dozen people were sitting around talking . All of them were women , and most were wearing jeans . Great . <p> Keith nabbed us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye was puffing up so much , I was scared to ask how it felt . <p> A blonde woman with a long pageboy was sitting near where we had staked out floor space . Keith introduced her as Sharon Silversmith . <p> " Oh , hi , " I said . " You 're the one who 's being transferred to Omaha , right ? " <p> " Yes , " she said . " I 'll miss our community here , but it 's necessary . " <p> " Is it a job transfer ? What do you do ? " I asked her . <p> She smiled . " Well yes , in a way . I 've been called to start a new coven in that area . You see , this is what I do . " She gestured around the room . <p> I gulped . " Excuse me . I 've never known anyone who was a full-time witch before , " I said . " But then , I guess I 've never known many witches either . That 's one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps so much to have a community , people who are interested in the same things you are and all . " <p> Sharon smiled . " How did you get interested in paganism , Angie ? " <p> " Well , I think I was born pagan , really . I mean , paganism is the belief that all things are animate , right ? " <p> She nodded . " More or less . " <p> " Well , as far back as I can remember , everything seemed to be alive to me . For instance , when I was little , just learning to count and all , in my head , numbers had color and gender and a kind of  --  personality . So when I took a comparative-religion class in my freshman year , and learned something about paganism , it just clicked . I did some more reading , and things just kind of grew from there . " <p> " That 's interesting , " Sharon said . " I 've never heard the paganist view applied to mathematical concepts before . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaned over and said , " Hi , I 'm Barbara Cowdin . Keith told me you were a student too . Are you at U.T. ? " <p> I nodded . <p> " We have something in common then , " she said . " I 'm doing my Master 's in theology right now , but it seems narrow , so I may switch to rhetoric for my doctorate . What 's your major ? " <p> " Computer science , " I said . My voice sounded real loud all of a sudden , because one of those lulls in conversation had just hit . People all over the room were looking at me . <p> " Computer science ? " Barbara said . You could tell that , to her , it was like admitting to using plastic garbage bags . <p> " It 's because I 'm an Aquarius , " I said quickly . " You know , electronics are our thing . " Everybody kind of relaxed , and just about then Karina came in . She was wearing a saffron-yellow caftan this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see that my choice of clothes was going to work out after all . <p> " Welcome , everybody , " Karina said . She opened a cupboard and took out a very large gold cushion , which she carried to the center of the pentagram . She sat down on it and beckoned , " Friends , let 's begin our discussion . " <p> Everyone picked up their cushions and moved to the perimeter of the circle . Karina saw me and waved me over . I set my cushion down next to Keith 's and stepped a little nervously into the pentagram . I felt a little tingle as I crossed the line , like when you get a low-level electrical shock . A thrill went through me , I have to admit . Magic ! <p> " Angie , " Karina said . Her voice echoed off the walls a little bit , because of there not being any furniture , I guess . <p> " Hi , Karina , " I said . " Thanks for inviting me to come . " <p> " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Androcles told me you must join us . " <p> " Androcles ? " I said , looking around . " Uh , is he here right now ? " <p> " No , dear , unfortunately not . He went on a little errand for me . But he gave me a message for you . Sit , " she said , and patted a spot next to her on the floor . I went and got my cushion and sat where she 'd indicated . <p> Karina took my hand , pressed it flat between her palms , and closed her eyes . " Your energy is bright , " she said . " Vivid and strong , the energy of the new age , the Age of Aquarius . Androcles ' message is this : in seeking your familiar , you must not be deceived by an unfamiliar guise . Nor must you be deceived by the familiarity of the spirit which guides you . Look around you for the spirit , Angie , which you will know by the sign of the crescent moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Androcles says you will find your true path in life as well . " <p> People were nodding very seriously . Apparently a message from Androcles was a big deal . " Thank you for giving me Androcles ' message , Karina . And please thank Androcles for me too . " I was n't too sure of the etiquette involved . <p> Karina laughed . " No need for me to do that . I see he 's returned from his errand . " <p> I looked up and saw the big cat sitting just inside the circle , holding a twitching green lizard in his mouth . I sneezed . " Thank you , Androcles , " I said . <p> Karina said , " He says you 're welcome . Androcles , how wonderful that you are so prompt in returning to us . Will you put the blessing in my workroom , please ? " <p> The cat got up and walked off , still carrying the lizard . I sneezed . <p> " Well , " Karina said . " Any thoughts about the message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keith cleared his throat . " Well , Androcles is telling Angie that her familiar may take an unusual form , maybe not a cat or a dog or a bird , as many of us have . " He nodded to the others . <p> " I 'm allergic to all those things , " I said . <p> " Apparently , finding her familiar will bring her to full power , and give her the guidance to find her destiny in life . " Keith spoke in a deeper voice than usual , almost like it was his message , instead of Androcles ' . <p> " Exactly ! " Karina said . <p> Sharon said , " Angie , do you have any pets , or any wild animals that you take care of ? " <p> " I 've been thinking about that , " I said . " I 've never had pets because of my allergies . I feed the squirrels at school sometimes , but that 's about it . " <p> " Odd , " Karina said . " But Androcles ' message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong , you know , because he sees into the spirit world . In fact , when I had an out-of-body experience last week and stayed gone from my physical body too long , Androcles came and found me and brought me back . " <p> Barbara had moved over to the spot next to Keith . Now she said , " Oh , do tell us about it , Karina . " <p> The discussion went on for a while , ranging over lots of interesting astral adventures Karina 'd had . But I had trouble concentrating , because Androcles came back into the room , and I kept sneezing . <p> I blotted a lot and tried to listen . I was wondering if it would ruin my chances for joining the coven if I went outside for some fresh air , when Karina said , " Well , that 's about it for tonight , friends . Except for one last item . As you all know , Keith is proposing that Angie join our coven . After Sharon leaves for Nebraska , of course , so our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major ritual for the benefit of the coven . Who will volunteer to work with her on the ritual ? " <p> I sneezed , and Keith said , " I will . " <p> I liked the sound of that . " Thank you , " I said . <p> " Wonderful ! " Karina said . " Any other business for tonight ? No ? Good night ! " She got up and left the room . Androcles blinked one last time at me , then followed her before the echoes of my sneeze had faded . <p> Keith came over . I noticed his eye was really discolored . " Barbara 's got an arnica poultice she says will help my eye , " he said . " She 's going to take me home so we can pick it up . Can you find your way home from here O.K. ? " <p> " Sure , " I said . " Do probleb . " <p> I followed them outside and went over to Mr. Brown and watched Barbara get into a red Celica . I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he followed right after her . <p> Kind of a disappointing evening , in spite of getting a message special delivery from the spirit world . <p> " I 'll call you about the ritual , " Keith called . He waved and got into Barbara 's car . <p> I watched them until the red tail lights of the Celica were out of sight , and consoled myself with the thought that at least I had Mr. Brown for company . <p> I cut my afternoon class the next day to go to the library and look for spells . My grimoire was mostly full of practical spells : rituals designed to bring in money ( really handy around scholarship time , let me tell you ) , to aid memory ( exam time ) , to get your enemies off your back ( handy with some of the TA 's ) , stuff like that . I did n't think any of my spells would go over too well with Karina 's coven . I needed something big , like for world peace or something . <p> But most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coy about listing actual spells . After several hours , I gave up and got permission to go into the rare-book stacks . I found a couple of good grimoires there , but I 'd have to photocopy any pages that interested me , because they listed the ingredients for the rituals in code . All those newt 's tongues and adder 's eyes and stuff  --  those are just codes for different herbs and roots , because the witches in the olden days did n't want their secrets to get out . I could translate the recipes at home , once I normalized the funky old spelling , because I 'd written a PC-based translator program for ritual ingredients awhile back . <p> But none of the spells seemed like they would be very useful to the coven . There was a spell To Cast Demons from Thy Cow ; another To Stop a Bird in Flight . To Bring Forth Water from Ye Dry Well . To Win the Heart of the One You Love . <p> Hmmmm . I copied that one . You never know when something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking , hoping to find a ritual that would be beneficial to the coven . Finally , I found one that sounded mighty useful to me : To Summon Elementals of the Air . Well , maybe not the height of practicality , but you never know when an air elemental may be able to help out . Just think of the possibilities . <p> So I copied that spell too , and went home to read them both over . Once I had the ingredients translated , I saw that I could get them at the herb store on Braker without any trouble : it was mostly stuff I already had anyway , like vervain and oils of rosemary and peppermint . The only snag was that the spell to summon an elemental required that I find a place of power where I could conduct the ritual . <p> A place of power . All I could think of was Stonehenge . How would I go about finding the right kind of place ? Maybe Keith would know . I decided to call him . <p> When he answered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How 's the eye ? " <p> " Oh , it 's much better , " he said . " That arnica poultice really did the trick . Barbara sure knows her herbs . " <p> " That 's nice , " I said . " Are you feeling up to helping me with my ritual ? I 've found one I think would be good , but I 've got some questions about it . " <p> " O.K. , " he said . " What 's the spell ? " <p> I explained what it was for . <p> " Uh , " he said . " That sounds pretty ambitious , Angie . " <p> I glanced at the spell again . " Well , it 's pretty straightforward-looking except that I 'm supposed to find a ' place of power ' where I 'll conduct the ritual . That 's the only part I need help with . " <p> " Oh , " he said , sounding relieved . " That 's simple . What you do is get a crystal pendulum that 's attuned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amethyst is probably best  --  and wear it around your neck at all times . When you cross a point where the earth meridians connect with your own chakra meridians , you 'll feel something . " <p> " Kind of like a mild electric shock ? " I said . " I felt that when I crossed into Karina 's pentagram last night . " <p> " Exactly ! Androcles was right about you , Angie . You 're really actualizing your personal powers . " <p> " Why , thank you , Keith . That 's one of the nicest things you 've ever said to me . " <p> " Uh  --  " <p> " So , when do you want to get together to work on the ritual ? " I asked . <p> " Well , I 've got plans for this weekend , " he said . " There 's a psychic fair in San Antonio . But once you think you 've found the right place , give me a call . " <p> Well , I could n't exactly invite myself along to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , I decided that I needed to find that power spot A.S.A.P. I made a list of the things I 'd need and went to the herb shop , which was open until six on Fridays . They carried crystals there , too . <p> MR . BROWN was in a good mood , I could tell . He was shaking out some seriously good percussion on the way to the shop . " We 're going to be in business for real , pretty soon , " I said to him as we pulled into the parking lot , giving his dashboard a little pat . " And , who knows ? Maybe Keith and I will be setting up a little partnership of our own . " <p> I turned off the key , and he gagged and dieseled for at least a minute before shutting down . It made me wonder if something was wrong , or if he just was feeling so good he did n't want to stop yet . I decided to see how he sounded later , and got out . <p> Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . " Hey , dude , " I whispered to Mr. B. , " check out this classy chassis . " <p> A guy got out of the Ghia , looked at me and said , " Hi , Angie ! What are you doing here ? " <p> I did a double take , not recognizing him right off . Then I saw it was the guy I 'd met at school the other day  --  what was his name ? " Hiya , " I said . " The mechanic , right ? Roy ? " <p> " Ray , " he said , giving me that goofy grin again . He was tall , a pretty big guy to be driving a Ghia . <p> " Sharp car , " I said . " She looks like a restoration job . " <p> He got a little pink around the ears . " Did all the work on her myself , " he said . " Classic cars are kind of a hobby of mine . But not the fancy kind , you know , the Mustangs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some character . " <p> " Me too , " I said . " Hey , you come here often ? " <p> " Uh , no , " he said . " This is the first time . But I need some herbs for something , and a friend told me this was the place to get them . " <p> " Your friend was right . C'm on , I 'll show you the ropes . " We went in , and I showed him how to find the right herbs in the apothecary jars and how to bag them and stuff . I noticed he was getting a lot of the same things I was , but I did n't say anything . No point in being nosy . <p> After a little bit , I left him talking to the woman at the herb counter , found myself an amethyst pendulum and checked out . The clerk gave me a silk cord for the pendulum , and I put it around my neck right away . Ray was still talking to the herb lady , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rock and roll <p> Mr. Brown started up smooth and purred like a cat , although he reversed a little slower than usual . " Been flirting with that Ghia , have you , Mr. B. ? Come on now , time to go . Spirits of the Air , here we come , right ? " <p> And the best thing was , I found a place of power right on my way home  --  the interchange at Braker and Loop 1 . <p> It was really mystical . Evening had come by then . The first stars were beginning to show , with a three-quarter moon hanging overhead like a silver coin dropping through a slot in the deep-blue bowl of the sky . Mr. Brown and I buzzed along the access road , smooth pavement humming under our wheels , and when I came onto the wide curving entrance ramp , I got the feeling we were about to soar off into the sky , into another dimension . And then I got a hundred-watt jolt from the amethyst lying on my chest . <p> The place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arching ramps of the exchange  --  they looked like Grecian rains in the moonlight , like the awesome stones of a truly sacred place . <p> And then we were past the exchange , spiraling down to the regular highway , and the feeling faded . <p> " But we found it , Mr. Brown ! " I said . " And so quick ! Are we actualized or what ? " <p> I had meant to memorize the spell , but did n't get a chance because it had to be done at midnight " on the full of the moon . " That was only a couple of days away , and I still had to gather some things up : some frankincense and blue ribbons , blue candles , rock salt , and a flagon of springwater . Plus I had to dress in a blue robe with a blue cord around my waist  --  I was running around a lot that weekend getting all the stuff together . I called Keith and left a message on his answering machine about doing the ritual at midnight on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Advanced Design Theory which I usually love . But I was pretty excited . For one thing , I 'd never seen an air elemental , much less bound one to service . And I was pretty sure the ritual would impress the coven . Not just anybody can summon up elementals . <p> When I got home there was a message on my machine from Keith saying he 'd be ready at 11:30 , but he hoped we would n't be out all night because he was scheduled to have a reading the next day and did n't want his aura deplenished . <p> It was a really nice evening  --  cool and clear . A good omen . I put all my paraphernalia in my backpack . Then I set my alarm for eleven and took a nap . Aura deplenishing and like that . <p> When I got up , I felt sparked , like I 'd had a full night 's sleep . Mr. Brown was in a terrific mood , too , I could tell . I opened the sunroof to let in the night air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took off for Keith 's house . For some reason , I missed the exit and had to double back , so it was about 11:40 when we got there . He was waiting out front , shivering a little . <p> " Hi , " I said . " Sorry we 're late . " <p> " We ? " He peered into the car 's backseat . " Is someone else with you ? " " Just Mr. Brown , " I said , giving the dashboard a pat . <p> " You 're weird about this car , Angie , " he said . He grabbed the door handle and gave it a good yank . The door flew open , and Keith fell down . I heard his shoes clunk on the curb as he bounced . <p> " You O.K. ? " I asked him . <p> He stood up , brushing at his jeans . " I guess so . Damn it , I just washed these . " He got in and closed the door very carefully , then fastened his seat belt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just do n't seem to be working right . " <p> I started to apologize again , but he said , " Forget it , let 's just go . " <p> " O.K. , " I said . " This should be quite an adventure . I 've never summoned an elemental before . " <p> " You havent ? " Keith eyed me . " Are you sure you can handle it ? " <p> " Of course , I said . " I found a place of enormous personal power right after I got the stuff for the spell , and the way I see it , things are falling into place for a reason . " <p> " If you say so . " <p> We zipped along Loop 1 at about sixty-five , because there was no traffic . Keith complained he was cold with the sunroof open , but we were at the Braker exchange in less than ten minutes , so I did n't bother closing it . I exited and pulled off on the left side , just under the first big ramp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time . Then it settled down to a continuous tingle . I could feel the energy humming along my skin and inside my bones . " Wow , " I said . " This place makes me feel like I could fly . " <p> The ramps and columns were even more beautiful in full moonlight , gleaming white and mysterious overhead , weaving complex patterns of energy against the sky . <p> I got out of the car . " Is n't it gorgeous ? " <p> Keith just sat there for a second . I leaned in to get my backpack from the backseat , and he said , " You 're kidding , right ? " <p> " About what ? " I said . I set my pack in the driver 's seat and opened it . The robe was on top . I pulled it on over my jeans and tied the cord at my waist . <p> Keith leaned across and put his arm over the top of my pack . " About conducting a ritual here , " he said . " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " It 's as far from a celebration of the natural world as  --  as an oil derrick , " he said . <p> " Oil derricks are neat , " I said . " There 's one down near Corpus that 's lit by those pinkish-golden halogen lamps , you know the kind I mean ? At night it looks like a fairy palace . Stinks , though . " <p> " Angie , " Keith said . " No elemental is going to come here . This is a travesty , a corruption , of everything paganism means . " <p> I yanked the backpack out from under his arm and set it on the hood . " I disagree , " I said . " Is n't Stonehenge a sacred place ? " <p> " Of course . " He sounded patronizing . <p> " Well , how is this any different from Stonehenge ? People built that too . It 's a pattern built from stone and so is this . I can feel the energy here , even if you ca n't . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumped . <p> " People built Stonehenge as a place of worship , " he said . " It 's the astrological arrangement of the stones and the accumulated energy from worship that makes it sacred . " <p> " You do n't know why they built it . It could have just been a picnic spot . And for all you know , the engineer who built this interchange was given divine guidance . " <p> " That 's nuts , " he said , crossing his arms . <p> " Oh , yeah ? Any nuttier than believing you 're one of the lost princes of Atlantis ? " I said . " You are n't a real pagan at all . If you believe in the spirit that resides in everything , that means everything . Not just the stuff that appeals to you as ' natural . ' " <p> " You 're twisting things , " he said . <p> " Oh ? Hand-hewed rocks are O.K. , but a gravel-silica aggregate is n't ? A mountain filled with iron ore can have a spirit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that same mountain ca n't ? Sounds pretty inconsistent to me , Keith . " <p> " You do n't know what you 're talking about ! " he said . " Highways and  --  and constructed things  --  are anathema to everything a pagan loves ! " <p> " Why , you 're nothing but a narrow-minded zealot ! " I said . <p> Keith got out of the car and slammed the door . On his fingers . He howled and yanked the door back open , cussing as he cradled the injured fingers with his other hand . <p> I walked around to his side of the car to see if he was O.K. <p> " Damn it , " he said after a minute . " This stupid piece of junk bites me every time I get near it . " He reared back and kicked Mr. Brown 's fender just as hard as he could . <p> I would 've killed him , except it was n't necessary . I think he broke his toe , but I did n't pay much attention to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunkered down next to Mr. B. and stroked the new chip in his paint . <p> " Poor thing , " I said . " I 'll never let him near you again , I swear . " I turned around then and said , " Keith , I 've changed my mind . I do n't want anything to do with you . Someone who mistreats another entity just because he 's too blind to recognize spirit in an unexpected place is n't worth my time . " <p> Keith was scowling . " Fine , " he said . " And you can forget about joining our coven . But how am I supposed to get home ? " <p> I shrugged . " There 's a gas station about a mile up the access road . You can always call a cab . " <p> He cussed some more , but I ignored him , and after a while he limped off . Slowly . <p> " You O.K. , Mr. B. ? " I whispered . " I 'm real sorry about that . " <p> His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figured I was forgiven . But something was nagging at me . I sat down on Mr. Brown 's hood . What had I said to Keith ? That he was too blind to recognize spirit in an unexpected place ? It reminded me of Androcles ' message  --  Karina had said not to be deceived by spirit in an unfamiliar guise . <p> And she said I would know my familiar by the sign of the crescent moon . I reached down and touched the crescent-shaped dent in Mr. Brown 's fender . <p> " I guess I 've been blind too , Mr. B. " I said . " But you stuck by me just the same . Thanks for getting rid of that turkey . " <p> It was getting chilly , I noticed , even with the ritual robe over my blue jeans . I looked around the mystical beauty of the interchange and wondered whether anyone else in the world would see it the way I did . So much for finding a community that shared my interests . Did n't look like pagans had any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Just then a car came along the access road and pulled off right behind us . I thought for a minute it might be the cops , but it was a graceful white ghost of a car , a Karmann Ghia convertible . I hopped down from Mr. Brown 's hood and walked over . " Hey there , Ray , " I said . " What are you doing out here ? " <p> He got out of the Ghia . " The spirit calls me sometimes , " he said . " This is a special place , you know ? Actually , " he added as a powder-blue drop-top Corvair coasted to a stop next to us , " some of my friends are getting together here tonight . " <p> A little red Midget with its top down came next , and its bearded driver waved to Ray . These cars were n't show pieces . Just by looking at them , I could see they had character . <p> " Way cool , " I said to Ray . " Are all these folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a car for a familiar . I figured I was just weird . " <p> " Weird in the right way , if you ask me , " Ray said , giving me one of his sweet goofy grins . " I 'm glad to see you finally figured things out , Angie . I was starting to wonder if you 'd ever realize about Mr. B. " <p> " You knew ? " <p> " I thought he had a lot of personality the first time I saw him . " His voice dropped to a whisper , and he patted the Ghia . " And then Miranda agreed . I think she 's got a little bit of a crush on him . " <p> I took his hand . " I 'm not surprised , " I said . I could feel my face getting hot , but I said it anyway . <p> The bearded guy from the MG came up . " Hey , Angie . Ray thought you might turn up here tonight . Welcome to the convertible coven . " <p> " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> They laughed . " Of course , " Ray said . He tugged on the blue cord of my robe . " And you 're dressed just right for the ritual we 've got planned tonight  --  we 're going to summon an air elemental to heal the ozone layer . " <p> And we did , and things have been great ever since . Ray 's even interested in algorithms . Which is n't surprising , really .
