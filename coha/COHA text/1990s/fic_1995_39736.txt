A WIDOW , she has come to this orphanage , the Home for Unwed Mothers in Paris , Arkansas , to suffer here the last hours of her daughter 's reckless pregnancy . A pregnancy initiated nine months before by such a man as would resume his strangerliness the very afternoon after his lovemaking . <p> The widow holds aside the orange curtain and peers through the skinny window alongside the door . Somebody is out near the copse of bodark shining a flashlight into trees . Looking for what , she wonders . She pictures her daughter as a little girl kneeling in the pew in a flowered dress . Her curved nose , the high pitch of her voice . Even through the door she can hear owls . The lowlife . The **26;485;TOOLONG who tripped through town and left her child with his own rotten , his illegitimate seed lodged within her belly . She wonders just where he is now , at the reckoning hour . <p> But he is ever more remote , the father of the unborn child . On a tugboat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will he make it so far up the Mississippi again with five weeks ' pay and ostrichskin shoes , looking for someone 's ear to eat , and with half a notion , steadily declining , to betroth his eternal loneliness to whatever sweet girl would part her lips to him , listen to his torrent of lies , and mistake him for the source of rivers . <p> The widow raised her child a Christian , with more sense than to run off with his like . Difficult it was , too , on a railroad pension . She had trusted the Lord to father her daughter . But no one in a small Arkansas town is invulnerable to Devil or stranger . For no one there in residence wore long-toed shoes nor brokered in tales the girl had not memorized and improved upon . in the dolorous hours she twitched in nightlit shadows of her mother 's house . <p> So it is , keeping vigil in the lobby , gazing through the curtained window into the night , and standing drooped in the tenth hour of her daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her child 's womb issues a tiny angel who rises like a moth to the ceiling . Who hovers there , semitransparent , watching the efforts of everyone below . Bathing them with sympathy as radiant as music . On its own warm current , it floats toward the open window . It will rise up directly to God , she thinks . But near the window the umbilical cord catches , jerking the angel back toward its mother . The angel wriggling awkwardly now . Tugging against the cord , reddening . More and more corporeal , losing altitude , wailing . Back toward the mother who begins to ruin everything , reaching out for it . Quickly the widow snatches a scissor from the side table and lunges , snipping at the cord dangling in front of her like a clothesline . Her daughter and the angel scream together in excruciating pain . Everyone , she realizes now , is staring at her , at the bloody scissor in her hand . Accusing her with their eyes , with their looming faces , saying , You gave this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no shred of love . How was he to make his way ? <p> What ? What she asks , waking on her feet , turning away from her reflection in the narrow window . <p> A girl calling , Scuse me Ma'am , Ma'am . <p> What is it ? <p> Miss Craver says . It sure is taking forever . She says you can come up if you want . Becky is crying for you . It 's gon na be so soon . She 's hollering and carrying on . <p> She has forgotten the Bible in her hands until it drops to the flat red carpet . <p> I got it , the messenger blurts , stepping forward . But the widow reaches down quickly , before the girl , and snatches it up herself . Some of the pages have come out , for it is an old Bible , but the fierceness of the widow 's demeanor keeps the girl from attempting to collect these . She waits , adjusting her shift and glancing over her shoulder at the stairs . <p> Miss Craver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand near and give some comfort if you 'd care to . <p> She places the Bible neatly on the cane chair outside the second-floor room . If I 'd care to . Then she goes in . <p> In the likesame glance by which she recognizes her daughter in a cotton gown and long canvas socks flailing on the bed moaning Oh God , oh God , she regards the empty metal stirrups poking like gigantic levers from the bed 's either side . Her first impression synthesizes her daughter 's cries of pain with the stirrups , as though they in their cold metallic gleaming could be the source and incarnation of her daughter 's suffering . <p> Where 're you hurting , the widow queries from where she stands slightly stunned , barely within the door . Ogling the room . <p> The daughter gasps . On hands and knees at the bed 's edge , she retches up a thin bile that dribbles over the sheet down the iron bedframe to the floor . Gagging , pitches to her side , exhausted and huge , her protuberant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the widow 's direction . At the head of the bed , the aide wipes the daughter 's hair from her cheek . <p> Meanwhile she groans and rolls onto her back , and her sthenic hands fly around her face and breasts like paper birds on a mobile . There is a stool along the far wall , another long-limbed teenager atop it , her spread legs undoing themselves below her hem and recurling around the stool 's posts as she listlessly surveys the trembling and drooling pregnant girl , No more than three years between them . She leers at the newcomer , the widow , frozen at the door . Pops her gum , and once more sizes up the incredible belly . <p> From the sink and basin in the room 's far corner strides the midwife , horse-black-haired , a young woman though twice the age of her two assistants . She is wringing out a white washcloth . Sitting on the bed 's edge wiping the daughter 's mouth . Not acknowledging the presence of the widow with so much as a nod . Setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fortune-teller . <p> She has no right to judge me , the widow thinks , no right , absolutely no right . <p> Below the washbasin some old quilts are folded on the floor . The widow recognizes the pattern on top from where she continues to stand unmoving . Drunk Walking Through Rain , it 's called . During the summer and fall of her husband 's fatal sickness , she took up quilting on their front porch , slept there as well , sitting up , sore , wrapped in an unfinished pattern night after night , unable to endure the reek of infirmity within . <p> Now she has entered a room where woman 's belly eclipses the male imagination . But she is awkward , unpracticed , redundant . Unwilling even , participating in the delivery , to reconcile herself to her daughter 's disgrace . Why is it so hard to find the grace to muster sympathy for the desperation of others ? She has never conceded to desperation . Its nakedness makes her avert her face . She remembers a story her late husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stationed in Japan . About an emperor who steered his country into great prosperity , who lived a long life , siring many children . An eminent , cultured man . Who , on his deathbed , lost all dignity . He wept for three days until everyone in the city had heard him . Sobbing over and over like a baby , I do not want to die , I do not want to die . <p> Her daughter 's teeth are chattering , and she thinks back to the quilts . Somebody should get one . Then her daughter 's belly appears to mound all the more , her head and shoulders hunch forward toward her rising hips . Legs spreading , the gown rises to expose a strange macula of iodined flesh . Anus and vagina , two dark hearts . Visible from the larger , a thin trickle of blood . <p> The girl on her stool stops chewing gum . <p> The other girl pauses at the sink with a fresh compress . Slowly , the midwife lays her hand on the enormous belly . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two feet high explodes from between the exposed thighs with a sound like a balloon bursting . <p> The widow feels her disinvolvement grow exaggerated . She watches the girl leap from her stool , snatching up towels from a heretofore invisible pile . Spreading them across the soaked mattress and floor . The midwife takes the wet , swollen ankles and crosses them , crosses the daughter 's legs , repeating a mantra , Breathe , do n't push yet , breathe , do n't push . <p> And the room compounds with breath sucked in and grunted back . The midwife 's fingers within the vagina , stretching it . Great convulsive gestures and pandemonium . An urgent dialectic careless of the elder woman 's presence . She disappears , a cardinal in the quince bush . The midwife 's fingers inside the vagina . Withdrawn , massaging the pale orifice . The girls applying hot compresses to belly and perineum . <p> Finally the daughter 's screaming begins , shrill stabs like blasts on a dog whistle , into a barely audible register , and then contractions that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curses , not her momma , not the derelict father , but the girls who are turning her on her side . The daughter howls a string of outrageous execrations involving the Lord 's name the likes of which the widow never has heard . <p> Shitting a goddamn . Goddamn ! Shitting a watermelon ! <p> Then in whispers . My insides is ! Coming out ! Oh God . Oh God . <p> She grunts and pushes . <p> Do n't do that , shouts one of the girls angrily . Do n't do that , you 'll hurt the baby 's haid ! <p> But she grunts and tightens again , and the midwife quietly declares , It 's all right . <p> They lift her legs into the stirrups and bind them with belts and buckles twice on the foot and twice at the thigh . <p> Push into your bottom , the midwife instructs . That 's good , honey , go ahead . The midwife 's hand on her naked knee . A steady voice instructing the girls to massage the daughter 's feet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are like a volcano inside her . The quarter-sized opening between her iodined thighs reveals a patch of cheesy hair . Enlarging . The vagina round as a steel ring , its thin inner membrane shining . <p> The daughter pushes , exhausted . Not coming , she begs . Not coming out ! I caint breathe ! <p> Her eyes widen , and she does not breathe at all . Caint breathe , she gasps . Gone to die . And she strains for tiny sucks of air against some invisible clamp on her chest . <p> The widow wants to go over to take her hand , but she needs the hard surface against which she stands pressed . <p> She 's dilated , but the baby do n't want to come yet , the midwife lets the room know . Her fingers lost in the swollen vagina , brushing a lanuginous patch of undescendant skull . <p> The room smells deep to the widow , but not of anything she can say . Of something wrong . Her own body odor gone deeper . <p> Push , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gasps , My back . God Jesus ! <p> And this time the widow pries herself from the door and marches straight toward the bed , slides her hand under the soaking gown , under the small of back and rubs upward into the hot coals of her daughter 's spine . Her daughter screams , a short breathless abstract noise . The woman banks her fingers against the long scarp , the swell of muscle on either side of the vertebrae , and draws her fingertips along to the middle of her arched back . Her child makes a sound as deaf people make , and her torso grinds down onto the widow 's fingers . Unflinching , the widow slides her left hand under a shoulder to pry the girl 's weight from the hard bed in order to better maneuver the fingers of her right hand among the rib slats , along the gutters of the sharply segmented spinal column . She traces the winglike shoulder blade with her thumb , and it separates slightly so she feels its beveled underside . Then she closes her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayer , a prayer through which she escapes the moment 's welter . Again her fingertips smoothen the long troughs between her daughter 's ribs , she massages the wet deltas above the kidneys , her knuckles wedged between the hot sheet and the flesh that heats it . <p> Aglow with sweat , the daughter holds her breath , and her eyes break away from all of them toward the ceiling , beyond the ceiling . They focus wildly on a pain that is no one else 's . <p> The widow can see for herself the bones of her daughter 's pelvis giving way . Spreading like syrup . Her face beet-red . <p> Breathe ! Breathe ! You 're doing this to yourself ! the midwife snaps . The girl , who has swallowed her gum , echoes her crazily . Breathe ! Breathe ! Looking about , frantic , as though someone might halt the imminent tragedy in order to reassure her . And the daughter draws in a cluster of tiny sips of air , quick shudders like riding a fast car over gravel , mouthing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contorted into a relentless spasm . <p> All the mother has never thought , she begins to say . I love you , I forgive you , I love you , forgive me . And the girl mouthing simultaneously , I 'm dying , I 'm dying , her face a hideous garnet . <p> You can breathe ! Breathe ! the midwife hisses into eyes rolled back like bleeding stones , their terror fixed on nothing in the room . <p> At which point an electrical failure spirals along the nape of the older woman 's neck , and her brain flickers behind her eyes . She stumbles backwards , backwards , feeling backwards with her blind hands . Backs into the wall like a sightless animal , her face drained utterly . Down she slides , not wanting to lose consciousness , down the wall , knees buckling , haunches patting floorboards , chin nutating into bosom , yet straining to stay present . <p> Which is when the head begins to sweep out , the perineum dilating around it to thin transparency . Shrieks . <p> Burns ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , thin bright blood flicks toward the left flank as the perineum rips . The daughter 's body contracting in short pushes , the breath returning , she begins to pant through her teeth like a wild animal , past all screaming . <p> Baby forehead , top of brow , face covered in white grease . A pause in its descent . The midwife supporting the weird head at the vagina , saying Stop , Stop pushing , Stop now , Do n't push . <p> Stabbing blindly with her fingers and finding the umbilical cord , two lengths around the throat . The baby 's face screwed sideways , dark blue and purple under a chalky mask , the section of cord visible to the midwife limp and white . <p> She speaks to her assistants . Reaches into her smock and puts something in each of their hands . <p> Why , these are white shoelaces , one says . <p> From the baby 's head a deep throated gurgle . Inhuman noises . <p> She pries its mouth with the syringe while the girls tie off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shoves it into a nostril where it fills again . Then she brings the scissor from her smock and cuts the cord , one quick bloody spurtle , and ties it . Twists the head a quarter-turn and unwraps the sausagelike lengths of cord . <p> Now push hard , now do it ! the midwife commands with her hands on the infant . Supporting the head , she can actually feel the instant of the collarbone breaking . Push , push ! One at a time shoulders emerging . Push ! The body whooshes out . Prune face , wrinkled flesh in vernix , cheesy . <p> It 's a boy , she thinks , and wonders if she has spoken aloud . Purple rubber doll , dead-looking . He kicks , and she drops him and catches him before he falls . <p> The peculiar faraway catwail beginning . And everything suddenly at a distance . The midwife drifting into a wholesale distraction . God help me , she thinks vaguely . Above the tiny piercing yowl that seems to break not from the little jerking weight between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she hears the daughter weeping . The one girl choking and coughing . The other absolutely silent . <p> Against the wall , the older woman has lost them in a rich spiritual failure , and she can not stand . <p>
