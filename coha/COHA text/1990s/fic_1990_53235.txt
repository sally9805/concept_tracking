WE LIVED IN A NEIGHBORHOOD of delineations . All of the backyards on our street were wrapped around with fencing , and the rocky creek that ran behind our property kept us from getting to know the people who lived in the elegant Victorian houses behind us . Our own street was plain and crowded  --  a workers ' block , the neighbors called it , with narrow , meticulously swept alleys and front porches that led directly to the sidewalk . Privacy was sparse , even in summer when the trees were dense with foliage . In wintertime , the small squares of garden out back grew knotted over with dead grass and bits of trash blown up from the street . I did n't mind . Winter , too , was a division separating me from that part of myself who worked the soil . It was as though time did not exist during the colorless , wind-wracked months that kept me tucked inside our six rooms nursing the baby all day and paging numbly through the bright seed catalogs which arrived every morning with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby , spring settled in much earlier than ever in memory , spreading its welcome warmth across our unsuspecting northern city , arousing May blossoms in March , and drawing out legions of rope-skipping little girls and bare-armed young mothers pushing strollers up the sidewalk : ghosts and mirrors of myself . I would sit for hours on our porch steps with the baby in my lap , waving her tiny hand at the parade of citizens squinting by . The sun was in everybody 's eyes . For the longest time , every perfect morning seemed a gift . Winter had been dimensionless , innumerable gray months spent indoors ; I could not believe the frost was behind us already . I hung back , conservative , minding the calendar and not my stirring heart , keeping my seedlings indoors until May . <p> On the outside our house looked identical to the others on our street , but inside Hal and I had knocked away half the darkly papered walls and painted the remaining ones eggshell white . When the heat wave began , we mounted tasteful brass-and-wood ceiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a gigantic wicker one directly above our bed . At night we lay side by side beneath the circling blades , not touching , sweating , listening for the baby , listening to the rattle of a dozen ancient window fans straining to protect the sleeping households surrounding us . <p> When the baby cried out , I went to her crib alone . Sometimes I would find myself weeping noiselessly , standing there naked cradling her in the moonlight . I had a constant , indefinable ache that seemed to swell up inside of me like bread dough in the yeasty midnight air , and these feelings made me so ashamed . What business had I courting despair ? My life was everything that had been promised me long ago in chalky brilliant kindergarten colors . I 'd had no disappointments . And yet , my success had bred only melancholy , a horror of the future . This velvety , womb-perfect child  --  her life was somehow inextricably connected to my clandestine grief . Why , why ? I 'd wonder ceaselessly , worrying the pain , jiggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in sorrow ? It seemed I understood nothing anymore but the baby , and her only as I 'd never understood anything , that is , with my body alone . My mind , I could only hope , had receded somewhere safe beyond the present flood of tears and milk . <p> I had so much milk , too much . I would suckle her long past sleep , tucking her in only after my limbs grew cramped from cushioning her dozing form  --  and still my breasts wept on interminably into the night . Every morning Hal and I woke in a spreading circle of sour dampness . I laundered our bedsheets daily , but my milk had seeped down deep into the mattress and its yogurty odor invaded my sleep . Sometimes I feared this scent would be with us forever ; other times I mourned its inevitable evaporation . <p> I was not always like this . I had , in the back of our closet , half a dozen linen suits , one year out-of-date , with silk blouses and narrow skirts I could no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes . For years I 'd spent my days in front of a video display terminal in one of those tall , air-conditioned buildings with ochre-tinted windows that make the outside world seem more dismal than it really is . After work Hal and I met downtown and ate in fashionable restaurants with couples we knew from college , our friends . Our friends , never married , had since drifted apart and re-coupled . It seemed to me now that they must have been Hal 's friends all along , not really mine  --  and yet I also noticed that he never called them anymore . Every day at a quarter to eight he left me perched over the morning headlines with the baby latched onto my breast . I think if he had met the person I used to be , the crisp Ivy Leaguer with an answer for everything , he would have barely blinked in recognition . Hal was loyal as a weed , ready to love whomever I 'd become . <p> Now I passed most of my day in the garden , yanking at crabgrass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shadows . It was a postage-stamp yard with cement borders , but we had two decent shade trees and a hand-finished cherry-wood swing for the baby . The creek behind us was securely fenced , and anyway , she was not crawling yet . I let her nap on a blanket in the grass , checking her for bees and bugs , but nothing seemed to bother her . She was a good sleeper , waking only to nurse , and for that we took refuge in the house away from the neighbors who watched us all day long , like cats . <p> The neighbors were not impressed with my efforts in the yard . They sat on their porches all hours , fanning themselves with throwaway leaflets from the appliance centers , drinking iced tea from cracked mugs , and shouting at me in thick voices about how I ought to do things . Shade the seedlings rom the midday sun , they hollered , shrugging to each other in case I decided to discard the advice . Use brown paper bags . I you water , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The neighbors were old ; together , their fathers and they had built the neighborhood , literally  --  ours was a street of retired stonemasons , their wives and widows . They did n't give a damn about the drought or the withered pansies in their windowboxes  --  they 'd seen flowers enough for a lifetime already . It was the heat that got them . Our houses were boxy ovens topped with flat black sun-absorbing tar . That 's what drove them outside all day and half the night in their rumpled undershirts and sleeveless floral housedresses . Porch dwellers , Hal and I called them . They 'd have rather sat indoors watching TV , but for two solid months that summer the thermometer never dropped below ninety-five . This was unheard of in our city where , formerly , a week in the high eighties was considered a major heat wave . Inside their houses the unwatched television sets screamed , danger ! danger ! When the city opened Emergency Cooling Centers in church basements and shopping malls our neighbors refused to go . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoarse with indignation , when we asked . For blacks . Hal and I shuddered when they spoke like this , but what could you say to such people ? <p> For two years now they had been watching us renovate our house , carting away what they pronounced loudly among themselves to be perfectly serviceable squares of linoleum and dropped ceiling tiles . We ripped out the fireproof mock wood-grain wall paneling that the family , whom they 'd all known intimately for sixty years , who 'd built the house during the first presidential term of Woodrow Wilson and sold it to us during the final years of Ronald Reagan , had installed at enormous personal expense to last forever . We pulled out the modernized flamingocolored bathroom fixtures and installed an ancient clawfoot tub and slightly chipped porcelain pedestal sink . We chopped up the concrete walkway out front and replaced it , painstakingly , with salvaged brick . The spectacle of our weekend efforts had already provided years of entertainment for the neighbors , although in the past they had offered us little by way of direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was different now that I was home all day wandering the yard in sneakers and baggy shorts , my hair pulled up in a quick ponytail , and a baby on my hip . Suddenly I was something they could understand , a housewife . At last I was fair game . <p> We know what you paid or your house . It 's making our property taxes go up . <p> What you want with a second car ? You do n't go nowhere all day . You do n't need a car . We do n't got enough spots on this block or one arnily parking two cars . <p> I could n't blame them for resenting us . The rest of their lives was only eight , ten years , maybe less . Their own children had long since abandoned the neighborhood for tract housing in the suburbs , and when they themselves were gone their houses would be sold to people like Hal and me , and desecrated : backyard grottos dismantled , Virgin Marys toppled and banished to the curbside trash , sturdy aluminum siding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moldings , never meant to be exposed to light , would be stripped naked for all to see . Hal and I were only the beginning of an inexorable wave of change that would soon eradicate everything they had ever viewed as permanent  --  including the past . In a few years our neighbors would be dead and the houses they had built with their own hands gentrifled beyond recognition , perverted into synthesized quaintness . Brass fixtures and ceramic tiles were on their way , as sure as  --  or surer than-the rain , and there was nothing anyone could do to stop it . <p> I kept busy in my backyard , ministering to my garden , listening to the neighbors expounding to each other about " them , " by which they meant , variously , the government , industrialized oriental nations ( " Japs , " they called them , still rankling in emotions left over from World War II ) , the rich families whose landscaped Victorian gardens butted up behind us , and blacks . The hyperbolic intensity of their speech fascinated me , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world so single-minded and pure , and I realized I had nothing to lose in humoring them . <p> I began by smiling up into their unfriendly faces from my place among the flowerbeds . If my neighbors adopted masks of anger and mistrust , I retaliated with one of calculated innocence . I encouraged them to think me stupid , a method of gaining confidence . My baby , of course , was my ultimate weapon . She was the first child born on this block in twenty years , and I flaunted her shamelessly . How could anyone resist her green eyes , her strawberried forehead , her wispy brown curls ? Soon I found myself in the thick of their bullying advice ( against breastfeeding , in favor of machine-washed diapers and early toilet-training ) , and I responded feigning interest in whatever they said . I was as submissive as a dog in the bushes . I had come to believe that I needed them : after all , there was no one else to talk to anymore . Hal was rarely home , and when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely , he still bubbling along as I had before the world had suddenly rolled over before my eyes and exposed its dark underbelly , and I , too overwhelmed to voice what I had seen . The baby was a part of me , but she was mute , and insensible to the horror I felt . Together she and Hal made less than one . Our college friends held no interest for me anymore and my former co-workers had receded to vague pillars  --  no , the shadows of pillars  --  in my mind . There was no one else . <p> The neighbors did not like Hal . They harbored what seemed to be a fixed level of animosity towards us , a family of intruders , and as their sympathy towards me and the baby expanded , their tolerance for my husband diminished sharply . <p> What does he want with them fancy suits and faggot shoes with holes punched through ? In my day , a man wore working clothes to work . <p> How come you let him come home so late ? In my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supper . <p> Lookit that grin on his face . <p> It was not long before I had allowed their comments to seep through the barrier in my psyche which separated me from them . My creeping feelings of resentment towards Hal heightened . Increasingly , I saw him through their eyes : a callow and frivolous young man with no capacity to comprehend the darkness shouting in our faces . His energy and optimism annoyed me , as did his tolerance for my gloom . He brought home meaningless , wasteful gifts of flowers ( we had a garden full of flowers ) and perfumes ( I , who wallowed in lactation all day long , was clearly beyond the powers of commercial fragrances ) . His touch became an irritant to me . His body , which had always seemed so desirable , now looked boyish and insubstantial . I began to avoid his eyes , his conversation , his sex . <p> Surely the neighbors heard us fighting ( just as we , over past years , had frequently lain awake listening , in morbid fascination , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , but she was an angel , sleeping through all symptoms of disaster . Each night , after the words between us had been exhausted , an unbearable screaming silence welled up loud around our bed until , finally , I began to seek relief lying all night on the cool bare wood nursery floor , close to the sighs of our dreaming daughter . <p> On the first of July , the water bureau declared our local reservoir levels seriously depleted , and the mayor called for emergency water rationing . But I 'd already , against the advice of my neighbors , concealed a dribble hose beneath yards of plastic mulch to keep the moisture in my flower beds , and over that I 'd piled woodchips to keep out the killing heat . I could n't  --  would n't  --  let my garden go . By mid-month there were 194 tiny green tomatoes swelling my seven plants . I had baby zucchini on the vine , japanese eggplant , swiss chard , kohlrabi , peppers in six shapes , begonias , zinnias , nasturtiums , impatiens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mix " I could n't name off the top of my head , plus basil , Italian parsley , three varieties of mint , cilantro , lavender , and dill . Such lushness in that time of drought seemed scandalous-lewd , almost  --  and I was wanton , reveling in it , but I did n't care . This was no time for false modesty . That my private Eden prosper seemed to me somehow intimately connected with the survival of the Earth . To abandon it now would be to give up hope . When Hal came home at sunset we turned the oscillating sprinklers on and stood together in an uneasy truce , watching the fugitive waters dance beneath a blanket of darkness . <p> August was so dry the air crackled . The thermometer seldom dipped below a hundred , not even at night . All around us the yards were brown and matted , dead as winter , and all day long I heard the not-so-distant wail of fire engines . The creek out back had disappeared , leaving behind a miserable trickle of stinking mud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burnt , even beneath my floppy hat , even in the shade . My scalp turned pink straight down the part . The neighbors called to me across the fence . Let it go . It 's too hot for the baby . <p> My garden lived on for a while without me , nursed at the roots by its secret irrigation . Inside , with the blinds pulled tight , I suckled the baby , our bare skins slippery with sweat , her tiny fingers exploring my face . Her eyes were the green color of deep summer , summer as I remembered it from childhood . I was frantic , thinking she would never smell this color , never know coolness or dank , creekside shade . I love you , I love you , I could n't stop saying . I could n't stop crying . I had so much milk . I wished that I could irrigate the desiccated world . <p> It stayed hot . The baby grew listless and flushed . The pediatrician said he 'd seen a lot of this lately ; it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I bought an antiseptic-looking plastic bottle and teased her lips with boiled tap water until she turned away ; she would not drink . Satisfied , I called the doctor back  --  then , while I was languishing on hold , she drank . <p> She guzzled water , apple juice . Chemicals flowed between her lips . She was ruined . Until that moment , her tiny body had been one hundred percent from me , mine , and now she was the world 's . And the world was dying . There was nothing I could do now to stop her or protect her . I had dreaded this day for some time . I cried great salty tears and my nipples throbbed as she sucked down the polluted stuff . There would be no going back . On the other side of the hot white window the triumphant sun was singing . Even the crisp green edges of my tomato leaves would scorch . <p> Within a week 's time , half of my garden was dead , and what remained lived on in anarchy . Ripe tomatoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the heat . Zucchinis of unnatural proportions snaked along the ground . Weeds grew raucous and leggy while my flowers shriveled beyond resuscitation . I could hardly bear to glance , let alone step , outside into the terrible sun . Still , my neighbors ' voices rang in my ears . Even with our windows closed and shades drawn tight I could hear them shrieking back and forth to one another from their porches . <p> It was difficult to breathe . <p> One Friday evening Hal brought home an air conditioner , a prize previously absent from our street  --  too extravagant for our neighbors , too vulgar for us . But the endless heat had worn away everybody 's pride . As we struggled to mount it in our bedroom window I could see them down there in the alley looking up at us , their ancient faces blunt with rage at our easy affluence . I 'd betrayed them for a nickel , for the price of a refrigerated night . I 'd crossed back over the line . <p> That evening we carried the baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the now cool sheets . The air conditioner hummed reassuringly ; no street sounds would penetrate our cocoon . Above our heads the ceiling fan turned like the spokes of a rimless wheel . I watched it in the flickering darkness and felt Hal 's hand smooth inside my own . At last we were alone . <p> When we woke hours later to the sound of violence against our window , I imagined , in my confusion , that the neighbors were pelting us with rocks . But it was only the metallic ping of rain on the air conditioner 's housing . We embraced each other ; however , our joy was brief . The baby 's skin seemed unnaturally hot . When Hal stepped into the humid blast outside our room for her medicine he discovered waterfalls pouring into every open window . <p> It rained all night and into the murky gray Saturday that followed . Every four hours we fed the baby a dropperful of sticky pink liquid , as directed on the box . At seven we turned off the air conditioner ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory from childhood of fat green caterpillars captured in leafy cardboard prisons . We pulled long-lost sweatshirts from their drawers and wandered listlessly from room to room , cradling the baby . <p> At eight we called the pediatrician 's answering service . At nine I put her in a tepid bath . <p> She was fussing and refused to nurse . We tried to feed her sterilized tap water from the bottle . At ten our phone was dead . <p> Outside , the street had disappeared beneath a swirl of floodwater . Hal 's convertible , left topless out of long habit , sat out front like an overfilled teacup . My car was wheel-well-deep in a private curbside pond . <p> At eleven the electricity went off . <p> At noon she vomited her medicine . We lit candles  --  the afternoon was dim  --  and rocked her . Outside , there were wires in the street . <p> It rained all day and into the night . The baby stayed feverish and cranky . We did not know whether to hold her in our arms or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies make her even warmer . Her tiny body radiated heat . All night we sat staring out the window past our candlelit reflections into the thick blackness that was formerly the world . <p> The storm broke at dawn on Sunday . In the strained , pink light of morning Hal looked older and grimmer , like a glimpse into the future , and this filled me with a vague and terrible sadness . A gulf yawned between us that we lacked the energy and tension to navigate . <p> We did not speak much ; we were beyond words by now . We could focus on nothing but the baby , who was limp and hot in my arms . Hal climbed down into our cellar and searched among the bobbling detergent bottles and half-empty cans of historically-correct paint for his old rubber dinghy and the bicycle pump . The back was clear of downed wires , and the creek would take us straight to the main street where we would find help . <p> I had nothing to say . I , who had since childhood mistrusted boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who spotted death daily disguised as weather from the sky . I followed him into the dinghy . <p> The creek was at our kitchen door . The back porch made a good launch , and we drifted uncertainly into the yard . Hal had the paddles and I held the baby tight against my breast . It amazed me to see the fences gone , our yards obliterated by this strangely peaceful landscape of water-bound trees . Except for the occasional floating tomato , my garden might never have existed at all . <p> I could see them , the porch dwellers , framed in their open secondstory windows , waiting for us to leave . For once they did not shout but instead spoke among themselves in low voices , shaking their heads . I sat transfixed ; they were refugees in their own houses . They who had chosen to live their lives out on the porch were suddenly displaced upstairs into the abandoned quarters of their absent children . <p> Look , I whispered to Hal , but our raft had been caught by the current , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had not occurred to us that our innocuous little creek could grow so brutal . Hal , caught by surprise , was no match against its frenzy . We were crashing up against trees and sunken bushes . I watched his arms in disbelief as they strained against the crazy water . For one endless moment I was certain that the raft would be torn or overturned before Hal could manage to maneuver us out of our own backyard . I was clutching my baby so tightly that she squirmed in protest , despite her lethargy . <p> I could see everything clearly now : the baby torn from my arms and vanished like driftwood . We would stand no chance of finding her . She who had no conception of death would wash painlessly into its chambers , feeling only a temporary loss of heat . Feeling , perhaps , relief . It was Hal and I who would remain thrashing in the turbulence , unable to reach her or each other and unwilling to let go . <p> We snagged , for an instant , on some solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I heard human voices . There were people standing on a brilliant green lawn banked up with creosoted timbers . I saw them in a blur : two yellow-haired boys dressed for church in matching madras trousers . Their father behind them holding a rake , an impression of orange-and-yellow snapdragons , a woman 's face peering out from the gazebo , an enormous sun-dappled house beyond . The yard was littered with a thousand tiny twigs , but otherwise untouched by the flood . In a fraction of what time it takes to tell this I was passing up my baby to the strangers . Hal 's voice was calling me , but I was already in the water . Arms , not his , were pulling me up the bank , and as I strained past them I could see him one last instant , whipped around the bend , and he was gone . <p> <p> By KAREN RILE <p>
