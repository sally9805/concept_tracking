<p> A few minutes before noon on Nov. 16 , my little sister , Wendy Maraniss , said goodbye to her 11-year-old son , Dave , who was practicing at the grand piano in their front room . Play a little slower , she gently instructed him , and then she bounced out the door to go to work . She was driving from one college town to another in Upstate New York , from her home in Ithaca to her teaching assignment in Geneva , about an hour 's commute . To Wendy , neither the journey nor the destination seemed burdensome . She loved to drive , it was her time alone to think , and she thoroughly enjoyed teaching piano and accompanying her students , one of whom had scheduled a session with her at Hobart College that Sunday afternoon . <p> Winter had already descended into the gorges of the Finger Lakes . Only two days earlier , a snow flurry had forced her to stop halfway to Geneva and she returned home , much to husband Brian 's relief . But now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shining , and Wendy was on her way . She was driving the same flimsy subcompact , seemingly made of tin and cardboard , that had served the family 's needs for 14 years . Brian 's vigilant concern for his wife 's safety had only intensified this fall , when she added the commute to Geneva to her already overflowing list of assignments ; he had recently prepared the car for winter with a new set of snow tires . Wendy never seemed as concerned about her well-being as he was , and at times would chafe at his cautious nature . But she followed his most persistent request : Call when you get there , he always said . <p> She always called . <p> Soon after Wendy left , wending north out of Ithaca on Route 96A , Brian took their two boys , Dave and big brother Max , 14 , on a long walk up the hill to his office at Cornell 's school of industrial and labor relations , where he works as managing editor of the ILR Review . While doing some catch-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxiously for word from Wendy . An hour went by , then two . No call . He tried to calm himself by thinking : I 've worried about her hundreds of times over the years and everything has always turned out okay . <p> Finally , he and the boys returned the mile and a half down the hill . It was after 5 when they reached the front porch steps of the old wood house on Lake Avenue . Already dark . Wendy should have been back by then , but the car was not in the driveway . Brian walked through the shadowed hallway to the kitchen and around to the dining room , where the phone sat atop a bookcase . There were messages on the answering machine . Brian hoped to hear Wendy 's voice . Instead he stood and listened as the tape played out his most dreadful apprehension . It was unbelievable , yet irrefutably true . A call from someone at Hobart . So , so sorry . How horrible . Wendy killed like that . In a car accident . <p> At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small town of Varick in Seneca County , about 15 miles north of Ithaca . She was driving on a straightaway stretch of two-lane highway along the side of Seneca Lake . The road was 90 percent clear , according to the state police report , and 10 percent windblown , slippery in spots . She hit a patch of " black ice , " glassy ice the color of the roadway and almost impossible to detect . Her little car went into a skid , swirling into the other lane , where it was hit broadside by a big Buick . Wendy died immediately of a ruptured aorta ; literally , a broken heart . <p> It took all of my 25 years of newspaper training to report even that much about her final seconds of life . Maybe someday I will feel the need to learn and memorize every detail , but not now . Now I feel that the details do not matter . My little sister is dead . She died in an accident . Accidents happen . They are random acts of physics . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them changes a thing . <p> Wendy came along at a low point for the Maraniss family . My dad was temporarily out of the newspaper business then , an unhappy salesman at a variety store in Detroit with a lovely , intelligent and underappreciated wife and three , now four , kids . We called her Little Red when she arrived on June 27 , 1955 , with her fuzzy orange hair . For some reason my mom let me name the baby , and I named her after a cute kindergartner named Wendy . Everything started to turn for the better after her birth , and though it surely might have been coincidence , Dad never thought so , and neither did I. Wendy made the family whole : two boys , two girls , the oldest and youngest with red hair , the middle two with brown . She was not just a distraction from tough times ; she illuminated the way out . <p> Within two years of Wendy 's birth we had moved to Madison , Wis. , and my dad , after struggling for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a newspaperman at the Capital Times . Wendy was our good luck charm . She helped the Braves win the World Series in 1957 , and sat by my father 's side in the living room of our house on Regent Street , putting a hex on the opposition as the Packers started their 1960s dynasty . She was my protector : Whenever I was in trouble with my parents , which was virtually all the time as an adolescent  --  getting bad grades or losing my gloves or forgetting to go somewhere important  --  Wendy would stick up for me , even crying if that would get Dad to lay off . <p> Little Red followed me to Randall School , and then to West Junior High . We shared the same childhood landscape : Vilas Park , Camp Randall and the Field House , the cluttered newsroom of the old Cap Times downtown . Her intelligence was far keener than mine , yet she never got her high school diploma . Wendy quit the public school system after ninth grade and attended Madison Community School during the early 1970s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative was mostly to stay home . <p> No conscientious parent ever home-schooled a child better than she home-schooled herself . Wendy spent several hours a day in our back room , playing the piano intensely , and an equal amount of time sprawled on our living room couch , wrapped in a blanket , reading Russian novels . She aced the GED , and earned degrees in piano performance at the University of Wisconsin and Yale School of Music . <p> A despairing year in New York followed . I can not say what the arbiters of musical talent there were looking for but I am sure that whatever it was , Wendy offered something deeper . The world is full of artists who present themselves empathetically onstage , then step back into the real world and behave like jerks . Wendy was the real deal ; she felt everything she played . Her intense love and understanding of texture , nuance , clarity , beauty , and her hatred of bigotry , false adulation , mob psychology  --  all of that somehow came out in her music . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working as a bank teller . One day , near her apartment on the Upper West Side , some lowlife tried to mug her . She was stunned . " I do n't know why you 're bothering with me ! " she yelled . " I do n't have anything ! " <p> She packed her bags and headed home to Madison . There , while working as a census taker , she met Brian Keeling , a shy , acutely perceptive English major , and married him in 1981 . He came along at a crucial time , when she was struggling with self-doubt , and his uncommon honesty and practical nature helped her recover . Within two years , when Wendy was 28 , she left Madison with her husband and first son for a new life in Ithaca . She was the last of the Maraniss children to leave town . My parents hated to see her go , and soon moved away themselves . <p> We were a family that for four decades , since Wendy had come along , considered itself exceedingly lucky . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start to think that you never were . Death not only changes the future , it reshapes the past . <p> After Brian got the news of her death from a disembodied voice offering condolences on the answering machine , he undertook a task requiring unimaginable courage : He called my parents in Milwaukee and told Elliott and Mary Maraniss that their youngest child was dead . Then Mom and Dad , with their own sudden weight of grief , had to pass it along to my sister Jean in Pittsburgh and my brother Jim in Amherst and me in Silver Spring . <p> No sound I have ever heard could reach the depth of emotion of my father 's wail on the telephone that night . I will hear it for the rest of my life . <p> I had been thinking about fate and odds and random acts for months before Wendy 's accident . One joyous day last summer , I took the subway from Manhattan out to Shea Stadium with my friend Blaine Harden to watch the Mets play the Atlanta Braves . We sat in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foul territory , some 440 feet from home plate . Late in the game , Andruw Jones , a young Braves slugger , cracked a ball that came soaring , higher , higher , closer , closer  --  right at us . Blaine ducked and everybody else scattered . The ball hit me smack in the hands and bounced away . <p> All night long , and for days and months afterward , I was obsessed by the randomness of that event . How was it possible that the baseball found its way exactly to me , so far away , in that very seat in the upper deck ? I could go to Shea Stadium every day for the rest of my life and sit in that seat and never touch another baseball . <p> Someone could drive up Route 96A every day for decades and never hit that patch of black ice and skid into the southbound lane and hit a big Buick and die . But the ball found me and the ice found Wendy and a random act has broken the hearts of everyone in my family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noon last Thursday at First Unitarian Church in Ithaca . The church was full . Our family sat in the first two rows . My mother wore a locket with Wendy 's picture inside . <p> The best musicians in Ithaca , a city of music , all performed  --  including Wendy . The service opened with a tape of her playing a Bach partita , my brother Jim 's favorite . Wendy 's colleagues from the Ithaca Piano Trio , her practice partners and Cornell friends , her comrades in the vanguard of contemporary music  --  singly and in pairs they rose to play selections from Bach , Mozart , Shostakovich , Olivier Messiaen and Jules Massenet . Trudy Borden , a mentor of Wendy 's , played " At the Base of a Great Mountain " and the Little Rondo , selections from the Twenty-Four Little Pieces , by Wendy Maraniss . <p> The music and testimonials went on for more than two hours , and I learned as much about Wendy as I had in the 42 years before . As a sibling , you know your brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in ways that words can not describe . But you can not know their daily lives . <p> I learned that Wendy was a beloved piano teacher who infused her students with her passion for music . I learned that she never yelled at those students ( she had at least 40 , ranging in age from 5 to 30 , when she died ) . If one came to her having decided to give up the piano , she had nothing but sympathy , explaining that she too had stopped playing at one point but came to regret it later . I learned that she would not charge students who could not afford to pay . I learned that once a year , on New Year 's Eve , she would drink too much wine and get giddy and then sick . <p> I had sensed that the last few years were the happiest of her life , and now I discovered why . She had reached a point where family life and career were moving in the same direction . She had managed to be , at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the center of Ithaca 's music community . All the musicians wanted to play with her . They said she could play anything , and get it right , and fill any room with extraordinary beauty and intensity . Despite her modesty , her family had always known her genius , and now we discovered that others had come to see her in the same light . This realization was at once thrilling and unbearably painful . <p> All of these thoughts washed over me as I listened to the music celebrating her life and mourning her death . It made me think about the people our modern celebrity culture honors . To peer into the fetid life of a dysfunctional public figure , we buy books by the millions . We weep and throw flowers at the memory of a distant princess . We scream in delight and tear at the clothes of immature frauds . We tune in to hear experts with bloated egos talk about how right they are and how wrong everyone else is . We pay young men millions of dollars to hit or shoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luxury cars and listen to them whine about feeling underappreciated . And yet we all know people who are the real thing , out there in places like Ithaca and Madison  --  and Washington , too  --  teaching glorious music to our children , appalled by self-righteousness , searching not for status but for meaning . Driving off to work on Sundays in their old cars . People like Wendy , my little sister .
