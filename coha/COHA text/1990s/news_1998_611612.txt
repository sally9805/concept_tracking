<p> When President Clinton this month broached the unorthodox idea of letting Americans buy insurance through Medicare before they reach age 65 , he had in mind people such as Nick Porto , a technician at a Louisiana chemical company for more than two decades until he decided to retire early . <p> Two months from now , Porto will lose the company health insurance that followed him into retirement . He and his wife , both 63 , are too young to qualify for the nation 's health insurance program for the elderly . And they panicked when they discovered that a state insurance plan , created a few years ago for people having trouble finding coverage on their own , would cost them $ 1,048 a month . <p> Yet even with their insurance about to end , Porto is uncertain about Clinton 's idea . Living on $ 25,000 a year , he is not sure they could afford the $ 300 monthly premiums that he and his wife each would have to pay to buy in . He thinks they might find a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shove , we 'll go ahead , " he said , " but it might be a little tough . " <p> Such ambivalence is part of the reason that , as health policy analysts begin to sift through the president 's proposal , many are concluding that it would make a relatively small dent in the insurance problems of Americans age 55 to 64 , the group it is meant to help . Administration officials themselves predict it would attract only about 300,000 people , a fraction as many as they have anticipated would benefit from other government health insurance initiatives of the last two years . <p> No one can say for sure how many people would sign up . But even if it reached as few as the administration says , analysts believe it could prove highly significant for a reason that administration officials are not mentioning . It could provide the props for a far more fundamental change in health insurance for the elderly : the age at which people can become full-fledged members of Medicare . <p> The possibility of raising the eligibility age beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year  --  because the program will be unable to withstand the medical costs of the large baby boom generation when many of its members begin retiring in about a decade . But so far , proposals to raise that age have bogged down , in part because of criticism that older Americans would be unable to afford insurance while waiting to join the program . <p> By allowing them to buy coverage through Medicare in the meantime , " it makes it possible to have a conversation about eligibility age that is n't all-or-nothing , " said Bruce Vladeck , who until last year was administrator of the agency that runs Medicare and is now a professor of health policy at Mount Sinai Medical School in New York . <p> " This could be part of a bigger chess game , " setting a precedent of charging people of different ages different amounts , said Brookings Institution health economist Robert D. Reischauer , a former director of the Congressional Budget Office . " This expansion might make the more bitter pill a little easier to swallow . " <p> Clinton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They say they want to help some people in the short run , while deferring long-term proposals to a bipartisan commission on Medicare , which is to begin meeting shortly , now that the White House and congressional Republicans have ended a dispute over who should be the panel 's chairman . <p> But Chris Jennings , the White House health policy adviser , said , " If you really do want to raise the eligibility age  --  which would be a difficult thing to do  --  you absolutely can not do that without having a policy like this in place . This is an essential underpinning . " <p> Even on its own , the White House 's idea would mark the first time in Medicare 's three-decade history that people who are ineligible for full-fledged inclusion in the program could pay extra fees to receive the same health services as the program 's 33 million beneficiaries . <p> The proposal is the latest in a series of White House attempts to secure insurance for specific pockets of the population since Clinton 's broader health care reform plan failed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget contained $ 24 billion intended to extend coverage to half the nation 's 10 million uninsured children . The Kassebaum-Kennedy law of 1996 was intended to help up to 25 million working Americans and their families at risk of losing insurance because they have medical problems or are changing jobs . <p> Older Americans who have not yet turned 65 are a group that has particular problems with the health care system , studies have shown . In the mid-1980s , some three-quarters of retirees who had worked full time in medium and large companies were allowed to keep their company health insurance . Today , only half can . And because they tend to have more medical problems than younger Americans , when such retirees look for coverage on their own , they often find it too expensive  --  or impossible  --  to buy . <p> The administration is trying to reach that group , through a proposal that represents a political and budgetary balancing act . <p> Jennings said the administration settled on the Medicare idea after considering , and rejecting , the possibility of trying to stiffen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older Americans individual policies at affordable prices . That left officials looking to Medicare as a solution , but just months after making a variety of Medicare cuts in the budget agreement , they knew they could not make any proposal that would siphon money from the program . <p> Besides , administration officials faced a hostile Republican Congress , eager to denounce any attempt to expand the role of government in solving social problems . And even before the president unveiled his proposal , it was drawing critics from the right . <p> So the White House tried to craft a strategy that , officials said , would require the people who benefited to pay the whole price of what it would cost to insure them  --  even though officials knew that , as a result , their offer would prove unaffordable to many of the people who need it the most . <p> In the end , the proposal that Clinton put forward calls for Americans who are age 62 to 64 to pay a monthly fee of about $ 300 . To make the fees more affordable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be especially attractive to people with expensive medical problems , he proposed delaying some of the program 's costs until later in participants ' lives . After they turn 65 , they would begin to pay an extra fee on top of Medicare 's usual monthly premium for medical care . The amount would depend on how early they had signed up  --  ranging from $ 10 to $ 20 monthly for people who joined at age 64 to $ 30 to $ 60 for those who joined at age 62 . <p> The proposal also would offer help to a relatively small segment of people starting at age 55 . So-called displaced workers would be able to buy Medicare benefits for a somewhat higher fee  --  about $ 400 a month  --  but would not have to pay the surcharge later on . A separate aspect of the proposal , not involving Medicare , is intended to assist retirees from companies that reneged on offers allowing them to continue health coverage after they stopped working . <p> Since the details emerged , analysts  --  and lobbyists on both sides of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Will it , in fact , have no effect on the budget ? How many people will prove able or willing to buy coverage ? And is the idea fair ? <p> According to a recent analysis by the Urban Institute of uninsured Americans ages 58 to 63  --  an age group similar to the population the proposal targets  --  two-thirds have income below 200 percent of the poverty level and two-fifths live in poverty . For a family of two , that level is about $ 10,000 . <p> Administration officials acknowledge that their plan would be unlikely to attract many lower-income people . <p> And , even if the plan does not hinge on government subsidies at first , Reischauer predicted it would " inevitably create political pressures for subsidies . We 'll see , after a few years , participation among those relatively well-off is high and among those who are poor is minuscule . You know that pressure will build . " <p> Others suggest that the idea of spreading out the cost  --  although intended to make coverage more affordable  --  could prove problematic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimidating to people , " said Marilyn Moon , a health economist at the Urban Institute and a public trustee of Medicare . " It sounds like a lot of money for the rest of your life . " <p> The burden of those lifetime surcharges would fall particularly hard on women , because they tend to live longer than men , said Diana Zuckerman , the director of research and policy analysis for the Institute for Women 's Policy Research . " It does n't seem fair . Current law makes no distinction between men and women in how much they pay . " <p> The White House 's Jennings acknowledged that the program would have limits but said it was worth trying . Administration officials said they wanted to find out how many people their approach would reach before taking on broader questions such as whether to postpone the age at which Americans can become actual members of Medicare . <p> " You could not even contemplate a conversation about raising the eligibility age , " Jennings said , " unless you had a viable alternative .
