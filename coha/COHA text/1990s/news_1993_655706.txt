<p> TO preserve his building or to preserve a school 's financial asset ... What would Frank Lloyd Wright think of today 's brouhaha over his " Hall for Tomorrow " located here ? The importance of this building , which was designed as the home for Jiyugakuen or " School of the Free Spirit , " is now being weighed against the value of the property on which it sits , estimated at upwards of $ 100 million in Tokyo 's still stratospheric real-estate market . <p> Today , luxury hotels and neon-capped office buildings loom in the distance , but in 1921 the site was surrounded by fields and farms . At that time , Wright , who was in Japan working on the design of the Imperial Hotel , was introduced by his assistant Arata Endo to Mr. and Mrs. Yoshikazu Hani , the publishers of a magazine called Fujin no Tomo or " Women 's Friend , " devoted to improving the housewife 's lot in life . <p> Mrs. Hani , Japan 's first female news reporter , was deeply troubled by her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hanis were firm believers in the value of the " thinking mind " and dreamed of a school where students would have the freedom to develop as " self-reliant members of society . " In the words of Raku Endo , Arata Endo 's architect son , " Wright loved her idea . Mrs. Hani 's approach was very similar to his aunts ' idea for the Hillside Home School in Wisconsin . " <p> On April 15 , 1921 , with one classroom barely complete , the school Wright designed opened its doors to 26 girls . " Madame Hani 's large group of pupils - pretty sloe-eyed ebony-haired young girls - made a picture I shall never forget , " wrote Wright of the opening festivities . Instead of being confined to textbooks , the students at this unusual school learned their lessons from the world around them . The miracle of life was taught by raising green beans and chickens . Math skills were honed balancing the school 's budget , and home economics by preparing hot lunches for fellow students and teachers . <p> The overnight success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the completion of the " Hall for Tomorrow , " or Myonichikan , plans were drawn up to move the school to a 25-acre campus in suburban Tokyo . Since Wright had left Japan in 1922 , the design of the new facility was left in the hands of his disciple Endo . To this day the Minamisawa campus continues to be enlarged under the aegis of Endo 's son Raku , a graduate of Jiyugakuen and a former student of Wright 's at Taliesin . <p> The Myonichikan remains largely as Wright and Endo planned . In contrast to the stylistic constraints and the strict hierarchy imposed on school buildings in Japan at the time , the Myonichikan was created " in the same spirit implied by the name of the school - a free spirit , " wrote the architects . The U-shaped building , which is now used primarily for alumni activities , consists of three separate pieces : two single-story classroom wings flanking a double-height assembly hall and dining room . The spacious lawn in the center is one of the few patches of greenery left in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tranquil precinct is to step back in time . Though the sounds of children singing and laughing are long gone , pint-sized tables and chairs designed by Endo are poised in the dining hall as if ready to accommodate hordes of hungry sixth graders , and the expansive fireplace in the assembly hall - even without logs and kindling - still fills the room with a warm glow . <p> But sadly , the Myonichikan is in a state of serious disrepair : its foundations are literally rotting out from underneath it , causing walls to splay and roofs to leak and rendering some rooms unsafe for occupancy . <p> Whether and how to preserve the Myonichikan is the subject of an emotional debate among the school , its alumni , architects , and others . Some are more concerned about Wright 's legacy , others about the institution 's welfare . <p> Because Jiyugakuen lacks an endowment the likes of many American private schools and must rely on tuition to cover its costs , the millions of dollars needed to restore the Myonichikan must be raised . Yet philanthropic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are no tax incentives in Japan for building preservation , rich people are more interested in buying art , " laments Gyo Hani , the founders ' nephew and current principal of Jiyugakuen . <p> Another option is government assistance . If , like the Yamamura House ( the only other Wright building left in Japan ) , the Myonichikan were designated an Important Cultural Property by the Japanese Government 's Agency for Cultural Affairs , it could be restored with the national and local governments footing some 85 percent of the bill . And Satoshi Miyazawa , the government official in charge of evaluating Japan 's historic buildings , has concluded that the Myonichikan may be worthy of preservation . <p> But there is a catch . In return for this status , the school must relinquish much of its control over the property . To ensure the integrity of Wright 's design , the agency would need to approve all modifications to the property . And the school would lose the option of ever realizing the property 's full value because any subsequent owner would also be obligated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school can have its cake and eat it too . " If I had my druthers , " says Bruce Pfeiffer , director of the Frank Lloyd Wright Archives , " I would like to see the school taken down and rebuilt at the Minamisawa campus where they have a lot of space . " <p> But to alumna Nobuko Kajitani , a textile conservator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York , " It 's not simply a matter of moving the building . We the graduates feel that this is not about saving the building but about trying to save the legacy of Jiyugakuen . " <p> Indeed , the school administration , whose primary concern is the running of Jiyugakuen , faces a dilemma . In response , the school has established a committee of 10 alumni to sort through the options . According to Tomohiko Ikari , the chairman of the committee , " There is no intention at Jiyugakuen to sell the building or the property . " And yet there is also the desire to retain the option of selling the property at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Myonichikan may not be Wright 's most impressive work , its uncertain future has drawn attention from both sides of the Pacific . <p> " I am sure that Japan still laments the destruction of the Imperial Hotel , " says Mr. Pfeiffer in reference to Wright 's masterpiece which met the wrecking ball in 1968 . But , as Ms. Kajitani suggests , the meaning of the Myonichikan goes beyond its architectural value . <p> " The building is an important link between the US and Japan , " says Yuko Hani , the founders ' granddaughter , " in 20 to 30 years we will be gone , but buildings can stay forever .
