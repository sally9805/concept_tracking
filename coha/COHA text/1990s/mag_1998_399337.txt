As Microsoft 's WebTV gears up to take on Thomson 's new Network Computer , here 's what you better know when the dust clears . // They 've got modems , memory , microprocessors and keyboards . But do n't call them computers . They plug you in to the World Wide Web and you can use them to exchange e-mail . But instead of using a fullfledged computer , they do it all with a little black box , your faithful TV set and a phone line . They 're part of the new revolution of " smart " gadgets allowing even those of you with little to no technical ability to become part of the ever-broadening , supercool Internet subculture . WebTV-both Classic and the new Plusand the fledgling Network Computer are most definitely computers , but their marketers want you to see them in a rose-colored light-to think of them as friendly extensions of the TV like a VCR or gaming system with an extra blast of entertainment power . WebTV Photograph // WebTV Plus licensees Sony , Philips and Mitsubishi share the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive , 56kbps modem , a video modem that handles a 10Mbps data feed , 8MB SDRAM , 2MB ROM for initial boot-up and a custom ASIC called Solo , which delivers advanced graphics , video effects and image enhancement . WebTV claims Solo 's 3D graphics engine delivers special effects that rival those produced by studio-quality special effects equipment . Keeping WebTV 's computer power a secret is tough because while WebTV and its licensees trumpet the muscle of the second-generation system , they do n't want to conjure up images of computers . " I hesitate to talk about the hard drive because of the image that it invokes , " says Greg Gudorf , director of digital media product marketing at Sony . The hard drive in WebTV Plus enables the box to run graphics more quickly by caching information on the drive . Each night , the service automatically downloads graphics and refreshed TV listings to the receiver . With information stored to disk , subscribers do n't have to wait for the receiver to connect to the Internet . " The hard drive has opened a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , co-founder and vice president of engineering for WebTV . " We can bring down Web pages and schedule them , and because they 're already there on disk , people can access them immediately . " Goldman compares the WebTV Plus experience to that of using a CDROM . He credits the vast bandwidth of the video modem for making it possible . " Video modem enables us to deliver multiple gigabytes of information to disk every day . " The modem is oneway but it will enable the company to deliver video clips and full-length movies to subscribers when it 's ready to launch in 1998 . WebTV 's VideoFlash technology uses MPEG1 video compression to deliver digital video to the TV using minimal storage . Firstgeneration WebTV owners see a graphic of a moving road as they wait to connect to the server . VideoFlash enables the company to send 15 seconds of video to viewers instead . How those video clips benefit the WebTV customer remains to be seen . It 's 15 seconds with a captive audience , and the revenue potential is huge . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maybe it will be an ad , or maybe it will be something more personalized based on what I 'm using on the Net , " says Sony 's Gudorf . For customers looking for info on jazz , it could be information about an upcoming jazz concert , or a jazz special on TV . Or it could just be an advertisement for the phone company . It 's also up to TV programmers to make content available for WebTV Plus Crossover Links , which connect viewers to Web sites that relate to a particular TV program . An " I " appears on-screen indicating there 's related program information on a Web site . By clicking a matching " I " button on the remote control or keyboard , you 're linked to the site . During a Sony demonstration of a prototype INT-W200 WebTV receiver last October , one of the few available crossover sites was tied to the HBO movie " Stepping Out . " The linked site simply listed other versions of the classic movie along with actors , dates and related information , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envisions a link between televised football games and related Web pages that supply statistics , player rosters and even instant replays using WebTV 's video capability . Broadcasters who support the crossover-link feature send URL data along with programming over the vertical blanking interval , Line 21 , in the NTSC signal . The " I " icon appears both on the electronic program guide and in the corner of the program itself . When viewers click the icon on the remote control , the TV picture remains active while the receiver 's modem dials into the Internet via WebTV 's network of 30 Internet service providers . WebTV was purchased by Microsoft in August of last year and , so far , the subsidiary is remaining rooted in its Palo Alto digs . In the near term , WebTV will benefit from Microsoft 's evangelism and relationships with content developers , Goldman says . During 1998 , engineers will work on running WebTV on the WindowsCE platform . " WindowsCE will provide richer experiences like games and other active , dynamic content , " Goldman adds . The Network Computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Network Computer ( NC ) has an open architecture that will take many shapes and forms in the years to come . RCA 's NC set-top box is the first on the market . It includes a $299 receiver with wireless keyboard that dials into the NetChannel monthly subscription service . Photograph webtv NETWORKS // Under the hood , the RCA NC packs a special-purpose 48-MHz Acorn Computer RISC processor , 5MB RAM , 8MB ROM and a 33.6kbps modem . " It 's a very small microprocessor that requires very little in the way of associated memory , " says Lou Lenzi , vice president of multimedia services at RCA parent Thomson Consumer Electronics . " It 's more of a single-purpose , low-end computing platform , " he says . Graphics coming off the Web are converted to NTSC in the box . If you want , however , you can go straight to VGA via a VGA port . There 's also an expansion slot for an optional ROM card for future applications . The NC is positioned as a tool that uses the Internet to enhance the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We would like viewers to use the Web as a resource and not necessarily as a destination , " says Jim Gustke , vice president of marketing for NetChannel Inc . NetChannel 's peg is its personalized information service built around the My Channel concept . Using " personal assistant " software from U.K.based Autonomy , NetChannel downloads information nightly that 's based on interests you 've conveyed to the NC . You indicate your approval of an item by clicking a box that reads " I like this . " The My Channel portion covers six popular topics : news , finance , sports , entertainment , lifestyles and learning . The personal assistant is a software agent that has the ability to identify word combinations similar to the way the human brain works . The agent sorts through text , seeking unique combinations of words and then prioritizing them . " If the personal assistant reads through an article and sees the words " car ' and " garage " next to each other , it gives out a low priority because it 's a fairly common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees " car " and " dinosaur " next to each other , it 's going to remember that because it 's different . " The assistant culls information provided by NetChannel partners including , among others , USA Today , SportsTicker , Quicken , CDNow , WeatherLabs Inc. and The History Channel . There 's also a Yahoo search engine for viewers who want to venture out to the Web on their own . Another personalization feature is Personal Picks , which delivers stories to your receiver based on previous consumption . " Depending on where you go and the type of stories you like to read within NetChannel , we can deliver to you suggestions of other related information you might care about , " Gustke says . A third tier of personalization is Hot Topics , which is less customized to a particular viewer but still uses agent technology to deliver a string of stories based on what the agent finds . Topical news that a NetChannel editor feels is relevant to the service at lare becomes an independent channel that 's covered for days or weeks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channels up-to-date and relevant . Photograph // The other major draw of the NetChannel service is the electronic program guide . Viewers tell the box which cable company they use and the service delivers the corresponding program guide . Viewers can program the VCR to record a show by highlighting the name on the guide and clicking on a RECORD button . Subscribers can also sort programs alphabetically , store favorite channels and group programs by genre . You can also jump to related Web sites from the program guide . The RCA NC is the first of many different products that will use the Oracle Corp . Network Computer concept of client-server computing . " There 's a shift taking place in how we think about computing that 's away from a general-purpose computer called a PC and toward what 's called an NC , " Lenzi says . " An NC uses the power of the network to drive the cost of the terminal-level hardware to a point that 's affordable and accessible to more people . " What that means is that you get to pick the flavor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the study , and entertainment-based NCs built into DSS , DVD and HDTV . Happy picking . <p>
