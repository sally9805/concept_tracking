Some people have dismissed Windows 98  --  The new operating system from Microsoft that goes on sale next week  --  as little more than a bug fix . Do n't believe it : if Windows 98 is a mere bug fix , then so was adding a fourth wheel to the automobile . This is an operating system that 's finally stable . My computer used to crash more than a three-wheeled car . Since installing Windows 98 two weeks ago , it 's run smoothly , perkily and reliably . Best of all , it has yet to freeze , or even shiver . <P> Although Windows 98 is hardly revolutionary , I recommend it to any PC user . My biggest beef is that Microsoft is n't giving Windows 98 away . Only a monopoly vendor of operating systems could sell a product , Windows 95 , that contains a passel of annoying glitches , then charge $89 to fix it under the guise of an " upgrade . " There is , I 'm told , a more charitable way to look at this : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning , you can consider Windows 98 the reward for your patience , " says the sunny Kip Crosby , who co-wrote The Windows 98 Bible ( Peachpit Press ) . Lots of people already agree . When an early version of Windows 98 was sent to testers , " 91% kept it on their machine because they felt it was more stable than Windows 95 , " reports Kim Akers , a Microsoft product manager . <P> So how can you take your PC from three wheels to four ? Installing a new operating system can be a ghastly experience . Some of you will remember upgrading from Windows 3.1 to Windows 95 and watching in horror as your computer froze during the installation . That should n't happen with Windows 98 . Microsoft has done more homework this time , and has learned that machines are less likely to crash during installation if hardware configuration occurs after booting up the newly installed operating system rather than before . Likewise , your participation  --  mostly answering yes to a series of prompts  --  is required for only the first 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some fresh air . <P> It pays to play it safe , though : before installing Windows 98 , back up any sensitive files onto floppies . Elect to make an emergency start-up disk , which is a way to boot your system if all else fails . Also during setup you can save a copy of Windows 95 . Do this in case you want to revert to your old operating system  --  a fallback if , say , your Win 98 disk is corrupted . Note , however , that the backup will consume 50 megabytes of space on your hard drive , which you 'll want to reclaim later . ( Windows 98 hogs 200 megabytes of space and likes an additional 100 megs for wiggle room . ) Delete the old operating system by selecting " Add/Remove Programs " in your Control Panel , and remove the entry " Delete Windows 98 uninstall information . " <P> There are other good reasons to install Windows 98 , which Crosby lays out on my website this week , at          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
