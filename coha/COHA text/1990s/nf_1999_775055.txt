Longevity Moving , and being himself , Slow , and unquestioned , And inordinately there , O stoic !  --  D. H. Lawrence , " Tortoise Family Connections " // In our competitive societies , " lasting " has come to mean outlasting . " I 've outlived my father and both grandfathers ! " " According to my doctor , I should have been dead three years ago . " " My insurance company is losing money on me . I 've beat my pension plan and cashed in on Social Security , far more than I ever put in . " Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life , because my life has outlasted the expectancy curve . // Not only have I defeated my genetic inheritance , my childhood schoolmates , and the actuaries , I 've held off death itself . Life : a contest with all others and with death , so that living longer becomes a victory , repeating each year on my birthday that famous passage from St. Paul : " Death is swallowed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " // Our experience of aging is so embedded in numbers of years left to live , as given by longevity tables , that we can hardly believe that for centuries late years were associated not with dying but with vitality and character . The old were not mainly thought of as limping toward death 's door , but were regarded as stable depositories of customs and legends , guardians of local values , experts in skills and crafts , and valued voices in communal council . What mattered was force of character proven by length of years . Mortality was associated with youth : stillbirth and death in infancy ; battle wounds , duels , robberies , executions , and piracy ; the occupational hazards of farming , mining , fishing , and of childbirth ; family feuds and jealous rages ; epidemics and plagues that carried off populations in the prime of life . Cemeteries were dotted with the short graves of children . // The intimate coupling of longevity and mortality , that link which monogamously marries the archetype of old with the idea of death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the advance of demographics . In France , positivist philosophy promoted the statistical study of populations , which moved death from the realm of the private and spiritual to that of sociology , politics , and medicine . The statistics on life span gave evidence of a falling death rate , which was read to indicate the progress of civilization . Society as a whole could prove its improvement by advancing longevity figures , and longevity could be advanced by new medical methods ( vaccination , pasteurization , sterilization ) and programs of public health ( potable water ; sewage treatment ; ventilation ) . // Demographics took an even firmer grip when Emile Durkheim , one of the fathers of sociology , analyzed suicide statistics , showing that each district in France had a suicide rate that hardly varied from decade to decade . A predictable number of people in any given district could be expected to commit suicide in the coming year . When the incidence of suicide dissolves into the sociology of class , occupation , heredity , religion , age , and so on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite apart from the psychology of the individual who commits it . The statistical fact becomes a societal force , dooming a definite percentage in each district to die by their own hands . Data become destiny . // The life expectancy curve carries a force of its own . If you place yourself on it as a female teenager , say , you may have a life expectancy of at least seventy . At sixty , you find your expected longevity has risen ; it may now be seventy-eight , or more . Once you arrive there , the statistical tables may place your life term at eighty-six . And so on . Even if you reach one hundred , actuarial statisticians speak of the " conditional probability " that there are a few more months or years ahead . Statistics con- firm that the longer you last , the longer you will last , so that with each day of aging you may expect another day on the " actuarial curve to infinity . " The curve can not predict when your longevity will end ; instead , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you toward death and revealing the bare fact of your mortality , the curve functions as a statistical annunciation of immortality ! // If " lasting " means more than outlasting statistical expectations , then what is it that lasts ? What is the " it " that persists and endures ? What could possibly last through all the events of a long life , remaining constant from start to finish ? Neither our bodies nor our minds stay the same ; they can not avoid change . What does seem to hold true all along and to the end is an enduring psychological component that marks you as a being different from all others : your individual character . That same you . // But what does " same " mean ? I have changed so much and am so different , and yet despite all changes something continues to assure me of being the same . I could lose my social identity , my physical configuration , and my personal history , yet something will remain the same , outlasting these radical vicissitudes . This book maintains that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sameness is the philosopher 's term for what we experience as our character , we will have to discover more about this deep principle " sameness "  --  what it is and how it works . No small job , since philosophers have been thinking about sameness ever since Plato made the Same and the Different two of the most basic ideas to enter into the existence of things , form our thinking about them , and even make them possible.1 // Philosophers play with the riddle of sameness . Take , for instance , your favorite pair of wool socks . You get a hole in a heel and darn it . Then you get a hole in the big toe  --  and you darn that , too . Soon the darned holes are more of the sock than the original wool . Eventually , the whole darned sock is made of different wool . Yet it 's the same sock . In relation to its looks and in relation to its partner on your other foot , it is still the same sock . They go out together and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to itself , its identity , it is the same sock , though it is different . // Here philosophers can apply Plato 's archetypal ideas of Sameness and Difference . The sock is entirely different from the original as far as the wool goes , but its shape has remained the same . It never becomes a different sock , despite the radical material alteration . Its material is different ; its form is the same . // By " form , " philosophers mean the look of the sock , by which you recognize it as a sock . ( Tube socks raise conceptual problems ! ) When can a sock not look like a sock and still be a sock ? Philosophers also mean by " form " the sock 's function as a match to its partner and to your foot ( form following function ) . A third meaning interests us most : form as the active principle governing the way the new wool integrates into the old sock . Form is thus visible shape , and the shaping force of the visible . Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character ? // A human body is like that sock , sloughing off its cells , changing its fluids , fermenting utterly fresh cultures of bacteria as others pass away . Your material stuff through time becomes altogether different , yet you remain the same you . Not one square inch of visible skin , not one palpable ounce of bone is the same , yet you are not someone different . There seems to be an innate image that does not forget your basic paradigm and that keeps you in character , true to yourself . The idea of DNAseems too tight to hold the psychic dimensions of our unique image . To embrace our complexity we need a larger idea . // Some Greek philosophers and thinkers of the medieval church attributed this consistency in the midst of alteration to the idea of form . Some further claimed that form individualizes . What causes each person and each thing to be different from other persons and things is the active force of form . No two forms can be alike . We are each maintained in our specific individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of William James 's suggestive terms , we are each an " each . " As " each " es , we are unique because each of us has , or is , a specific character that stays the same . // It is most important here to grasp that we are unique qualitatively . You have your style , your history , a set of traits , and a destiny . You are essentially different from me by virtue of the lasting sameness of each of our individualized characters . If the difference between you and all others were defined by physics , logic , politics , economics , and law , we would each be a numerical " one " without any necessary characteristics . The law says , " All are equal under the law " ; politics says , " One person , one vote " ; physics says , " No two bodies can occupy the same place at the same time " ; economics puts all eaches into categories  --  consumers , workers , owners , employers . When each one is interchangeable with any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ID number . Since uniqueness depends on the qualitative differences forming the consistent sameness of your individuality , the idea of character is necessary to keep us different from one another , and the same as ourselves . // Let 's go back to the sock . If what outlasts the wool is the form , then a preoccupation with physical decay  --  with where the sock is wearing thin  --  misses a crucial point . Sure , the sock is showing holes , and stitching up its weak places keeps it functional . But our minds might more profitably be thinking about the mystery of this formal principle that endures through material substitutions . Surely the lasting strength of character counts as much as the durability of wool . // Sometimes the stitchings and darnings do n't take . Medicine watches carefully for rejection after transfusions , organ transplants , and bone grafts . The formal principle that guarantees sameness despite the introduction of exotic material is named by medicine the immune system . This system accepts or rejects replacements in accord with its own innate code . The new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or , as they might have said in church debates nine hundred years ago , the material must be accommodated to the form . It must fit my innate image . The new part  --  kidney , hip , or knee  --  must become my knee . The new wool must become me. // What converts this " it " into " me " ? // Modern psychology , regardless of school , understands the assimilation of events into a " me " to be a function of character . The schools of psychology use other words for character , such as " personality , " " ego , " " self , " " behavioral organization , " " integrative structure , " " identity , " " temperament . " These substitute terms fail to characterize the styles of assimilation that are the hallmarks of individuality . We each respond to the world differently , handling our lives in a particular style . The word " character " implies a bundle of traits and qualities , habits and patterns ; it requires descriptive language such as we find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report cards , scripts and novels , performance criticism , obituaries . " Ego , " " self , " " identity " are bare abstractions , telling us nothing of the human being they supposedly inhabit and govern . At best , these words refer to the unifying sameness of people while neglecting their unique differences . // It is refreshing to discover that some of the oldest and most basic ideas of philosophy  --  Same and Different , Form and Matter  --  are actually at work in our daily lives , even in our bodies . I find it a delight that these old-fashioned woolly principles are immediately practical and can be discussed as bodily facts . Why must we be exhorted to build character and strengthen character when character is already a given , the staying power that keeps us who we are and holds our bodies to their form ? Imagine the body as an ancient philosopher , the body as a place of wisdom  --  an idea already announced in the book titles of two medical specialists , Walter Cannon and Sherwin Nuland. // Cannon in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body 's physiology knows what it is doing . There is a wisdom at work . The idea of character makes more understandable this governing wisdom . Moreover , if we regard character as more than a collection of traits or an accumulation of habits , virtues , and vices , but rather as an active force , then character may be the forming principle in the body 's aging . Aging then becomes a revelation of the body 's wisdom . // I am emphasizing form in the organization of matter for two reasons . First , to counter the hustlers of materialism , who ask us to buy the idea that we are complex pieces of biotechnology , best compared with the newest computer chips . Whatever form we show results from underlying biogenetic impulses . Form can be reduced to matter ; it obeys matter 's laws and is shaped by genetic material . Since matter does the forming , there is no need for a separate idea of form . // A succinct , well-written  --  and fantastic  --  passage from one of the world 's leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books . // The mind is a system of organs of computation , designed by natural selection to solve the kinds of problems our ancestors faced in their foraging way of life .... The mind is what the brain does ; specifically , the brain processes information , and thinking is a kind of computation .... The various problems for our ancestors were subtasks of one big problem for their genes , maximizing the number of copies that made it into the next generation.2 // Why do I call this fantastic ? Because this account of foraging ancestors , genes facing problems , and natural selection as deus ex machina leaves the big questions begging . Moreover , the statement is set down axiomatically , not as myth or as reductive simplification , but as self-evident truth , and that allows Pinker to go on blithely saying that psychology is engineering . // To reduce psychology to engineering brutalizes the meaning of form . My shape is more than how I 'm put together . We all know that the way to last is to stay in shape , but " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do diet , exercise , and bed before midnight satisfy the needs of your shape ? The first meaning of " shape " is " create , " which relies upon a force that is invisible and yet makes each creature visible in its own style . The blanket term " information processing " covers over the history of subtle thought carried in the idea of form . // My second reason for insisting upon form is to keep a psychological viewpoint when addressing psychological questions . After all , life to the one who lives it is harassed by psychological perplexities for which biochemistry and brain physiology offer little comfort . Why live , why live long and with the probability of biological impairment are questions irrelevant to these sciences . Even should they remove the impairment and prolong the years , the " why " questions remain which no " how " answers can satisfy .
