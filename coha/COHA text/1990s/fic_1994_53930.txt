GONVILLE LEMMING , CONtrary to his name , would not run headlong over a cliff for anyone , not even his boyhood friend , Hibbert Snodgrass . For Shoddy , Lemming would n't step off a curb , for fear of missing a dropped coin . Both were compulsive collectors , though their tastes diverged early on . Snodgrass made a false start in matchbook covers at ten and built an impressive collection before enthusiasm waned . At thirteen he foresaw no future in the field  --  but his fate was sealed when , scuffing along the street with Lemming en route to a Saturday matinee of I Walked with a Zombie , Shodgrass snatched from the sidewalk a freshly discarded , still fragrant Wrigley 's spearmint gum wrapper . Simultaneously , Lemming spotted a dime , dulled and worn , barely discernible from the concrete it lay upon . <p> Within a few years each became a master tracker of his particular quarry . The scion of well off people , Snodgrass gave little thought to money but could spot a gum wrapper at thirty paces : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain-sodden , they added to his burgeoning horde . <p> " A penny found is a penny earned , " Lemming maintained , poorer but equally sharp of vision . No carelessly dropped coin or bill escaped the radar sweep of his relentless quest . A steady jingle of copper and silver flowed into his poke , though he never spent any of it without severe crisis of principle . He developed the eyesight of a raptor , the whole paved city his mousing ground , able to detect a penny  --  the dark steel 1943 penny , mind you , rare in itself  --  on new pavement of the same hue fifteen yards away . <p> With time and maturity , Snodgrass and Lemming passed from practice to higher theory . Lemming could never convince Shodgrass that gum wrappers held no investment value even in the esoteric world of collecting . Jaded , unheeding , Shodgrass sought new heights . Spearmint , Juicy Fruit , Beeman 's , PlenTipak , Carefree and Cinnaburst he regarded as mere prelude to ultimate triumph . He heard of a fellow wrapper enthusiast a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy the collection , offering a handsome price , for it contained one of the very few grails of the narrow field : War Card wrappers from 1938 , almost unobtainable in any condition . Snodgrass 's offer passed from ridiculous to fabulous , but the owner adamantly refused to sell . How Shodgrass finally acquired that trove and went on to plan the capstone of his career was whispered darkly in the dusty meeting places of his kind . <p> Think of objets d'art so rare they are only rumored to exist , the stuff of legend . The actual cask in which once lay the myrrh bestowed on the infant Jesus by an oriental king , a handful of the grave earth of Vlad the Impaler , a piece of the True Cross  --  these are comparable . For Snodgrass had tracked down Fleer Flickers gumball wrappers ca. 1940 with a cartoon strip printed on the inner side of each . He was envied , of course . . . but colleagues muttered of his methods and the lengths to which Snodgrass was prepared to go with price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neglecting the business he inherited until it failed , Snodgrass was forced to offer his treasures for sale just to live . Futile and far too late . Only a handful of collectors specialized in gum wrappers and none could afford his legendary prizes at a fraction of their worth . He died a broken man , never losing his pathetic faith in Fleer Flickers , clutching the rarest of them to his breast as he expired . <p> Of a sterner breed , Lemming never loaned a penny without the return of two . In an expansive mood he might tip a waitress nine percent , but such generosity withered early and died as his love of found money distilled at last to the Absolute with his retrieval of a damp twenty dollar bill from the unpleasant floor of a YMCA men 's room . Unlike the late Shodgrass , this was not culmination to I Lemming , but a new door flung wide on vistas shimmering with genius . He trembled with his vision . On any given day he could find a coin on any street . Multiply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a fortune daily falling unheeded to pavements everywhere . Today America , tomorrow the world . . . <p> If he could somehow sweep up all of it every day . Impossible , of course , but suppose . . . <p> The ambition would not fade but grew in Conville Lemming . A vast , untapped grid of streets , cities , and states where lost coins lay star-scattered over a concrete cosmos , gleaming in imagination , firing his dreams at night . <p> Suppose . . . <p> The wings of Icarus had eventually to pass from fancy to fact ; Lemming 's vision must translate from chimera to fait accompli . As Snodgrass was rumored to have done , he overleaped human possibility to the possible at any cost . From a retired Satanist who had renounced the black ans to marry and care for an alcoholic church organist , Lemming purchased a grimoire guaranteed to contain the spells he needed , an arcane volume bound in foxed pigskin with parchment folio leaves . Counting her exorbitant price , the erstwhile lady of shadows offered practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all are dangerous . When you 're ready to make the call , I recommend a large asbestos mat . " <p> Lemming practiced , Lemming delved , fired by the undeniable truth that while he learned , sharp-eyed children , bag ladies , unworthy homeless , anyone and everyone was reaping daily the harvest rightfully his . His first invocations were flat failures , intermediate stages frustrating . Within his circle he was amazed , despite technique fast approaching mastery , how often he could summon one entity and receive another , like Mexican telephone service . Shady stock brokers , real estate speculators , collection agents , languid and androgynous Californians committed to health food , even a Scientologist loyal to the movement beyond death , who exhorted Lemming to join . So it went for weeks and months of abortive agony illuminated only by the distant gleam of profit . <p> Then , late one evening in the dark of the moon , when a heavy fog hung over Lemming 's street and morale , the flames leaped suddenly higher on the asbestos . There came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subtler effluvium of expensive aftershave , together with a few bars of elevator music  --  and a natty young man in a sixties vintage suit with narrow lapels and a slim funereal tie peered at him from behind black , very mod horn-rimmed glasses . His fulsome Power Lunch smile flashed from thirty-two precisely capped teeth . He raised a manicured hand in greeting . A jeweled Rolex winked below platinum-linked cuffs . <p> " Hey , guy . Glad you got it together . Call me J.B. " <p> Lemming felt like a man battering for hours at a door that opened unexpectedly , hurling him through on his own impetus . " Uh . . . yes . " <p> " Formerly with BBD &O,"; his visitor said briskly . " I handle the power accounts . Do n't want to hype you , but I 'm the guy who thought of squeezing the Charmin . Sorry it took you so long to get through . I 'm backed up on calls , but the Front Office is wholly in sync with your efforts . You want to explore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chase and deal ? " <p> A man able to spot a 1943 steel penny on dark concrete is not long without presence of mind . When Lemming regained his , he presented his strategy . Every dropped coin from every state ( lower forty-eight for a start ; later he might expand ) every day for the rest of his life . Delivery at midnight in paper bank wrappers , daily statement included . Innovative , of course , but could they handle it , yes or no ? <p> J.B.  --  even he who put entertainment into toilet paper and eroticized hair cream for television  --  was impressed . The capped teeth flashed in a smile that would have wooed Magdalene away from Christ . <p> " Well ? " Lemming waited . " Can do ? " <p> " Bottom line , G.L. ? It 's big . Overwhelming . Inspired . " The flames sprang up and disappeared with the apparition . Lemming fidgeted and mumbled for an hour , convinced he 'd blown El Dorado for good . He was just settling down to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sans combustion or music , abruptly filled the air in front of him . Lemming felt a bit jangled . " Hey , give some warning . Do n't you always come in flames ? " <p> " Only at first . The Satanists expect it , like holly at Christmas . G.L. , you 've done it . I told the front office  --  played it cool , trotted your idea around the block to see where it stopped  --  " J.B. 's expansive gesture carved success in the air  --  " and they fucking lit up , even the Prince . " <p> Who , he informed Lemming with genuine respect , had the cosmic foresight to sell capitalism to the Russians . " He 's on fire with it . Challenging , he said . Original , immense ! The only glitch . . . " <p> " What , what ? " Lemming caught him up , unable and unwilling to turn back now . " I know there has to be a contract . " <p> That was the obstacle : almost no precedent for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just lost and found and finders keepers . " The Front Office wants the deal for the pure top drawer thinking , guy . You are in . " J.B. 's ferret-sharp features glowed with the transcendent joy of seraphim . " No problemo . We always cut the contract to the deal ; that 's why we 've lasted in business . And here 's the beauty part . It 's gratis . " <p> The magic word plucked true music from the untuned strings of Lemming 's heart . " Free . . . " <p> J.B. shrugged ; the narrow lapels rose and fell . " Well , almost free . Sweetie , that 's a detail . We 're talking moon walk here . Mars walk , a giant step for mankind . " <p> " Not yet . Back up . " Lemming braked hard as the modifier twanged a more typical note in his soul . " What 's this ' almost ' ? " <p> Okay , up front , cards on the table . Front Office was willing to take the contract at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Quid pro quo , G.L. Our quid measured exactly to your quo . Not a day , not a second more . Hey , did I say this was gorgeous ? " <p> J.B. flourished a short-form contract before Lemming , offering a tasteful Waterman pen for signing . The client deferred until he had microscopically scrutinized every line for the boiler plate of legal grief : hidden clauses , default penalties . There were none . Cut and dried , straight as a ruler . However long he lived , he repaid that much time and not a day longer . Lemming signed , J.B. pocketed the contract and consulted his Rolex with a flick of the platinumed wrist . <p> " Five to midnight  --  uh , that 's my pen , G.L. He 'll be here soon . " <p> Lemming surrendered the silver mounted pen regretfully . " Who ? " <p> " Collector Number Five , one of our best . Solid rep , great on detail . " <p> " Here ? " Lemming swallowed hard . " He 's coming here now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith you get credit for today . Where do you want the stash ? " <p> An embarrassment of gilded fate . As the clock hands closed to scissor off the day , Lemming gestured vaguely . " Upstairs . . . guess . In the spare bedroom . " <p> " You got . Oh , baby , just one teensy thing . Come midnight , do n't bug the delivery man , okay ? By twelve he 's worked his buns off and in no mood to klatsch . Just let him do his thing , then go in and start counting . Ciao . " <p> By way of farewell , J.B. simply imploded . A hole opened in the air , sucked him in and away . Minutes later Lemming heard a muffled poof ! above , then movement and the sound of much bulk set down heavily about the floor and furniture . Then another pool and silence . <p> Elated but unnerved , Lemming crept upstairs to listen outside the bedroom . After a timorous five minutes he opened the door cautiously and snapped on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locker room odor of heavy physical exertion and  --  perhaps his stressed imagination  --  a sourness beyond the olfactory in the air , as if someone had left bitter curses in his wake like the reverberation of a slammed door . <p> A moment 's impression , no more . On the bed , chairs , nightstand , stacked on a side table , sprawled over the floor , was a small fortune in neatly rolled pennies , nickels , dimes , quarters , and Kennedy halves , pyramids of coins on the table , other piles collapsed under the sheer weight of their worth , spilling into the adjoining bathroom . Tucked into a sheaf of grimy bills , in a hand precise to the point of fussiness , was the accounting in each denomination and the day 's total : seven hundred dollars and thirty-six cents . <p> Lemming trembled and gibbered , sinking to his knees and fondling the bills , groping through rolled quarters , stroking like a lover 's breasts the solid half dollars . One day , just one , and seven hundred clams ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week , near twenty thousand a month . In a year over two hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars , to say nothing of potential bank interest . <p> Speak of miracles . Like a child at the beach , Lemming piled the coins about him in a high bastion of currency . He 'd done it , dreamed the impossible dream and made it real . At two A.M. his play fortress had attained the embellishments of a late Norman castle . With a nihilistic cackle , Lemming destroyed it with a sweep of his arm . He yawned , deciding henceforth to sleep here in his Collection room where cold cash could warm his heart . He cleared the bedspread of lucre , and the sound of it clunking heavily to the floor was the benediction of manna pattering down upon his parched soul . <p> " And it 's legal , " Lemming chortled into darkness and the unlimited future overhead . " No eternal price , just day for day . Can I cut a sweet deal ? " <p> What price after all ? Forty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought blissfully as his eyes closed , like joining the Peace Corps to avoid the draft . <p> If the faceless Collector slaved unceasingly , Lemming toiled as well . He grew accustomed to the midnight ritual on the last stroke of the hour , and poof ! scrabble , clunk , and thump overhead , muffled muttering poof ! again . . . and silence . Heavy days on a Superbowl weekend , light on April 15 after taxes when no one had much to drop , but never a day missed . Always the same meticulous accounting by his Collector , the rank smell of undeodorized sweat , and more money . Lemming lost five pounds sacking and carrying the loot to the bank before he gave in with bitter reluctance and bought a fourth-hand Econoline van to transport his wealth . <p> His first bank and then a second grew concerned with currency storage . After a fierce agony of scruples  --  you did n't spend money , for God 's sake  --  Lemming purchased a condemned house and then another , fitting each with barred windows and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer spread out or up , Lemming delved down , adding cavernous vaults under his houses . He loved to sit in his treasure rooms as in a church . When the subways rumbled beneath , his horde responded in a silver choir . To this monetary hymn the IRS sang their own gleeful counterpoint . Lemming groaned at their assessments , but that was how the nickel flipped . In the tenth year , arrogance growing apace with affluence , he allowed himself an indolent joke at Revenue 's expense . <p> " Look , " he condescended graciously , offering the harried tax rep the remains of a Diet Cola . " Instead of auditing all this , just tell me how much the President needs . And come on , join me for dinner . McDonalds has a special on small burgers . " <p> The decades paraded stately by in a jingling serenade of profit . Gonville Lemming grew indifferent to the muted sounds above at midnight , grew old with Collector Number Five who was ever punctual , ever precise in report . One Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an offering in the collection room of last week 's meatloaf , yesterday 's salad , decal coffee and a thrift shop card from the cheerful donor commending the loyalty of Number Five . <p> He should not have eavesdropped for gratitude . Beyond the door the sentiments were more audible than usual and graphic , their general drift defining Lemming as a mother-groping tightwad sonofabitch who would bum down an orphanage for fun and profit if he was n't too effing tight to buy matches . <p> Then poof !  --  silence and the smell of sweat lingering in the blistered air , ripe as the declined meatloaf . <p> In his last year of life , during a severe national depression and an odd shortage of hard money , Lemming brought off the coup of an acquisitive lifetime , loaning the government ten billions in ready cash at a mere eighteen point seven percent . The President flinched but signed . <p> " What 's so bad ? " Lemming comforted him , retrieving the pen as a memento . " You people pay that much on your plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vault space anyway . He considered allowing the truculent but tireless Number Five to shorten his route , at least skip the less solvent southern states , but thought better of it . Not the money but the principle ; next the shlep would want weekends off . <p> On the eve of his death , Lemming nibbled a day-old pastry and wrote a foreclosure notice on the White House , adding that he might extend their loan if the Pentagon were put at his disposal for coin storage , mints to issue a new Letoming Penny . The tottering government would have no choice but to accept . He sealed the notice and retired in the warm glow of a cup run over , a life full and well applied . He always slept in the Collection room these sunset years , closing his eyes on the sight of the day 's haul and opening them to the same comforting vista . This night , with a last loving caress for a roll of quarters , Lemming slept the sleep of the just and never woke . <p> The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning and left his body still supine , cold and stiff . Reaching for money as comfort , his hand simply passed through it . <p> " The bread 's real . You 're not , " J.B. announced from the second-hand Morris chair as he paged through Lemming 's contract now due for execution . " Wakey , wakey , G.L. Number Five has gratefully retired to pasture and pastimes after years of unfailing service to you . On behalf of the Front Office , I hope there 's no regret . " <p> From pure habit Lemming could wish for one more good Manhattan sweep . Fun City was always good for a bundle , and he 'd planned to make it early to the local Army/Navy store for a sale on surplus C-rations . " No , I guess not . " <p> " Good boy . A deal is a deal , right ? " <p> " Did I say it was n't ? " Lemming squared his ectoplasmic shoulders with no more than a sigh for bargains forever lost . " Day for day per agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swept over the contract . " Forty-three years , three months , two weeks , and change . Piece of cake , baby . We tried to get you Sundays off , maybe a coffee break now and then , but Number Five said no : he did n't get . Always was a kind of a twitch ; now he 's a pissed off prick . " The capped teeth gleamed in a corporate smile . " And fair is fair . " <p> Lemming felt a February chill of premonition , remembering meatloaf and curses . " Who 's Number Five ? " <p> The contract vanished into J.B. 's coat pocket . " Sweetie , I 'm running behind again , so can we split like now ? I got ta sell the American public on a new war with Iraq for God , Country , Mother , and Oil . " <p> Lemming allowed tacitly that he who squeezed the Charmin could surely wring the American heart . <p> " And you have to learn your route , G.L " <p> Another chill  --  late February this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the picture as we go . " J.B. invited him to the door which opened of itself on misty limbo . " Today you learn New York , toughest part of your circuit . Hey , I wo n't blue sky you . You know how many gum wrappers there are in the sewers of New York alone ? " <p> Gum wrappers . The shade of Conville Lemming emitted a pitiful sound . " Snodgrass . . . " <p> " Good old Number Five , " J.B. confirmed with institutional reverence . " And I mean he wants it all : Cinnaburst , Carefree , Trident , Beeman 's , Juicy Fruit , the whole nine yards . Bottom line , sweetie , you wo n't have time for coffee . He gets Alaska and Hawaii thrown in . " <p> <p> By Parke Godwin <p> Parke Godwin made his last appearance in F &SF; in our February , 1982 issue with " Sergeant Pepper Variations , " which he wrote in collaboration with Howard Roller . Since then , he has published some very fine novels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> About " Small Change , " he writes , ' I 've always been very lucky at finding pennies and nickels  --  sometimes quarters and , once , ten dollars  --  dropped on the pavement . In the last few years , I 've wondered : what if a guy could get it all ? Just how much money would he reap in one day ? One week ? One year ? There must be a substantial piece of small change jingling unnoticed to the pavements of America . Since the notion would n't go away , I eventually wrote it down . " <p>
