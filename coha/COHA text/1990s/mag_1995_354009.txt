JOHN R. SIGNOR , EDITOR OF SP TRAINLINE magazine , is not accustomed to late-night calls from the FBI . His quarterly publication , which has a circulation of 1,800 , goes out almost exclusively to former employees and aficionados of the Southern Pacific rail line  --  the real buffs , people whose worst railroad-related crime may be occasionally boring their nieces , nephews or grandchildren with boxcar arcana . But early last week the bureau did come knocking at Signor 's door in Dunsmuir , California . Did Signor write an article in the fall ' 95 issue called " Tragedy at Harney " ? He did . And was the article not about a terrible crime in 1939 , when someone removed a stretch of track , bypassed an alarm system and sent the train City of San Francisco tumbling into a Nevada canyon , killing 24 ? It was . And was Signor aware that almost exactly the same crime had just unfolded again on a train track in Arizona , like a nightmare repeating itself after 56 years ? Signor was aware . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60-degree night in southern Arizona last Monday . The moon was full , and Amtrak 's 12-car Sunset Limited , bearing 248 passengers and 20 crew members , was doing between 50 and 55 m.p.h. as it approached a gentle curve not too far from the tiny town of Hyder . It was 1:20 a.m. , and most of the passengers on the train , which is especially popular among retirees traveling from Los Angeles to Miami and back , were in bed . Suddenly , they were not so much awakened as catapulted from sleep . Those who kept their wits about them remember a terrible , prolonged shriek of metal against metal . For others , their waking sensation was pain , as they smashed into a wall or a chair or a sink . The Limited 's two diesel locomotives had safely crossed a 30-ft. - high trestle over a desert gulch . But the next five cars  --  a dormitory car for crew members , two sleeping cars for passengers and a dining car  --  had jumped the rails . One hit the ground below ; the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giant 's necklace . <P> Darryl Taylor , 29 , an Amtrak dishwasher , awoke from a concussion to hear people all around him yelling . " Some were screaming ' Where 's my wife ? ' ' Where 's my husband ? ' Some were screaming for their medications , " he recalls . Despite his injury , Taylor joined other passengers turned rescuers . ( The crash site was so remote that it took emergency personnel half an hour to reach it . ) He ventured into the overturned cars nine times . When possible , he freed the occupants by sledgehammering windows . For passengers too fragile to climb or be pulled out by the hands , he and others crafted slings out of sheets . Cuts and bruises abounded . Said one Samaritan : " I picked up a three-year-old , and his face looked like he had gone three rounds with Mike Tyson . " <P> Taylor and the other rescuers did not encounter any dead bodies  --  at least not until they reached the compartment of his friend Mitchell Bates , a cheerful 41-year-old sleeping-car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They found Bates crumpled beneath his mattress . " His body was bent , and his head was smashed , " says Taylor . " We were yelling ' Wake up ! Please wake up ! ' I sat by the door and cried .
