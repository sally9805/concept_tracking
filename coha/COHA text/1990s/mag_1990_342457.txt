It may be axiomatic to say that Saudi Arabia is deeply influenced by religious conservatives , but the specifics are often surprising . When the Sunday Times of London recently published excerpts of Ronald Reagan 's memoirs , for example , Saudi censors gathered all the copies that reached the kingdom and methodically blacked out a half-page photograph . The offending scene : Reagan bussing his wife on the lips . <P> With hundreds of thousands of American troops stationed in the country , both U.S. and Saudi officials have been nervously watching for signs of a culture clash . So far , the tensions have been minimal . But the growing Western presence has emboldened a clutch of Saudi women to test the mood for change . At first authorities downplayed the challenge , but last week Riyadh switched signals and made clear that even mild protests would not be tolerated . <P> The controversy centers on a seemingly minor issue : Should Saudi women be allowed to drive their own cars ? Two weeks ago , 47 women , most of whom had obtained a driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parking lot , dismissed their chauffeurs and then drove themselves in an orderly procession through downtown Riyadh . <P> When the police arrived to arrest the women , they first had to step in to protect them from furious members of the mutawain , the country 's religious police , who demanded that the women be jailed immediately . King Fahd deftly defused the dispute by declaring that a committee of religious scholars should investigate before any action was taken . The governor of Riyadh , Prince Salman Bin Abdel-Aziz , assembled a commission that rapidly decided that the women had n't actually committed a crime . The committee found there was no specific prohibition in the Koran on driving . In fact , during the time of the Prophet , women regularly led camels across the desert . Even now , Bedouin women have regularly been permitted to drive cars and trucks in isolated parts of the kingdom . The committee nevertheless gently advised against repeating the experiment . <P> The favorable ruling provided only momentary respite . Six of the women found themselves suspended from their jobs as professors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students staged angry protests . " Not one of my students understood what I was trying to accomplish , " said a stunned victim . Leaflets passed out at mosques during Friday prayers accused the women of undermining Saudi morality and , worst of all , showing signs of " American secularism . " The women 's names , phone numbers and addresses were printed and distributed . Menacing telephone calls followed . Says a friend of one of the women : " They are afraid that they are going to end up like Salman Rushdie . " <P> As the fury increased , the government reversed itself . The Ministry of Interior issued a statement last week declaring that " driving by women contradicts the Islamic traditions followed by Saudi citizens . " The careful wording took into account the fact that Saudi Arabia is the only country to hold that Islam bars women from sitting behind the steering wheel .
