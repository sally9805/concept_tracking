<p> Entering their first training camp at Wichita Falls , the Dallas Cowboys have more questions than answers . And the most important question of all , one that wo n't be answered until the regular season , is this : Has Emmitt Smith hit the wall ? <p> Smith rushed for 1,074 yards and scored only four touchdowns last season when the Cowboys finished 6-10 . Some NFL scouts who watched the Cowboys closely say , based on last season , Smith is in decline - used up after taking such a beating in recent years . They say that when Smith failed to find a hole he went down too easily , as if he were trying to protect himself against injury . They say he did n't show the burst that had allowed him to accelerate through holes and break arm tackles in the past . <p> Other scouts say Smith 's performance was difficult to evaluate because he was playing behind an overweight , overrated , underachieving offensive line that caused him to have his worst season in years . No matter how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing : If the Cowboys are going to bounce back from their worst record since 1989 , they must have a strong running game . And to have a strong running game , Smith needs to be durable and productive for an entire season . <p> If nothing else , the Cowboys ' offense was consistent last season . Dallas ranked 20th in rushing , passing and total offense . The Cowboys were 22nd in scoring . The offensive problems were caused by the running game . They averaged only 3.9 yards a carry and scored only six touchdowns rushing . <p> Chris Warren , another veteran running back whose career is in decline , was signed to back up Smith . The fumble-prone Sherman Williams has the inside track on being the third-down back , although Warren is a better receiver and has much better hands . That threesome does n't exactly scare the Giants , Redskins , Cardinals and Eagles . <p> When defensive players from the Cowboys ' NFC East rivals analyze Dallas ' offense , they see a line that is virtually the same . Larry Allen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Right tackle Erik Williams is a liability . Left guard Nate Newton may have lost about 60 pounds to get down to 290 , but he 's still 36 . Right guard Everett McIver , who came to Dallas as a free agent from Miami , is average . Center Clay Shiver has yet to prove he 's anything more than average . <p> One factor that should help the running game is the return of fullback Daryl Johnston , who missed most of last season after undergoing neck surgery . It remains to be seen whether Johnston will be the powerful lead blocker for Smith that he was before the injury . <p> Without an effective running game , quarterback Troy Aikman is going to take a beating . That 's one reason new coach Chan Gailey has installed the shotgun . Gailey may say it allows Aikman to read the defense better by seeing the entire field quicker , but the real reason is because he 's trying to keep his quarterback healthy . <p> The good news for the Cowboys and their legions of frustrated fans is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A 10-6 record could win it , and a 9-7 finish might even do it on a tiebreaker . The Giants , Cowboys and Redskins should compete for first place . It says here that the team that runs the ball the best will win the division title . No one knows for sure if that 's going to be the Cowboys . If it 's not , look for them to get another high No. 1 draft choice in 1999 . <p> Around the league <p> Capped out - One reason the Cowboys did n't sign more free agents is because quarterback Troy Aikman and cornerback Deion Sanders count $ 7 million each against the cap . They did n't start negotiating with their draft choices until last week . They made minimum offers to six of the players selected on the second day of the draft . The only one who got a decent offer was fourth-round pick Michael Myers , the Alabama defensive tackle who signed a three-year contract for $ 825,000 , including a $ 250,000 signing bonus . Myers , who was suspended last season for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get some playing time as a rookie . <p> The Cowboys began negotiations with No. 1 pick Greg Ellis , the defensive end from North Carolina , on Thursday . Their rookie pool is $ 3.4 million for nine picks . Ellis , who was drafted eighth overall , should eat up most of that pool . He is expected to get a little more than Jacksonville running back Fred Taylor , who was taken one spot behind him . Taylor signed a six-year contract for $ 10.7 million , including $ 5 million to sign . <p> Surprise , surprise - Ticket sales to home games at Vanderbilt Stadium are not going as well as the Oilers had hoped . They thought moving to Nashville would create a demand at the 41,000-seat stadium on the Vanderbilt campus . Although they wo n't say it publicly , the Oilers are afraid they will end up with only 30,000 season tickets . If their games are blacked out at home again , this time in the smallest stadium in the league , it will be another embarrassment to an organization that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bud Adams was assured that his team would sell out in Memphis and again in Nashville . They averaged 28,000 at the Liberty Bowl last season . By comparison , the Frankfurt Galaxy averaged 34,202 during the NFL Europe season . By the way , the Oilers have n't had a game televised locally since 1994 , when Jeff Fisher made his late-season debut as coach against the Giants on Monday Night Football . <p> Based on a true story ? - Actor Dennis Quaid , a Houston native , is about to begin shooting Oliver Stone 's pro football movie . The working title is On Any Given Sunday . Quaid , 44 , plays an aging quarterback trying to hold on to a job and remain in the NFL as long as he can . Al Pacino plays his coach . <p> To prepare for his role , here 's what Quaid should do - hang out in Atlanta 's training camp . Steve DeBerg is already playing that part . DeBerg , 44 , was signed to back up Chris Chandler . That means DeBerg should get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why did coach Dan Reeves sign DeBerg ? Because Tommy Maddox must have been unavailable . <p> " I would bet that I can be more productive this year than the two quarterbacks ( Peyton Manning and Ryan Leaf ) drafted first , " DeBerg said . " Defenses have gotten so advanced it takes more just to understand what you can and ca n't do . " <p> DeBerg has n't played in five years . Now Warren Moon , a mere 41 , is n't the oldest quarterback in the league . " I admire Warren , but he 's a young guy , " DeBerg said . <p> Say good night , Jeff - No matter what kind of spin the Bengals try to put on it , they did n't give quarterback Neil O'Donnell a $ 3.75 million signing bonus to carry the clipboard for Jeff Blake . The four-year , $ 17 million contract should be more than enough to tell Blake that coach Bruce Coslet has no confidence in him . <p> First , the Bengals brought back Boomer Esiason last season . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monday Night Football crew . Last month , they flirted with Vinny Testaverde . Finally , they signed O'Donnell , who had a 9-1 record in 10 career starts against Cincinnati . <p> It 's hard to believe , but O'Donnell , who has been an average quarterback most of his career , will have made almost $ 17 million in three years , including 1998 . He got $ 11.75 million from the Jets in 1996 and 1997 . The Bengals will pay him $ 5.15 this season . By comparison , Dallas ' Troy Aikman will earn $ 14.7 million over the same period . <p> Uncovering a diamond - The NFL 's annual supplemental draft for special cases does n't get much attention . Most coaches and staffs are on vacations . Most teams do n't even pay much attention to it . Such players as quarterback Bernie Kosar , receiver Rob Moore , quarterback Dave Brown and linebacker Brian Bosworth were selected in the supplemental draft . <p> Last week , the supplemental draft got more attention than usual because there were three good prospects . San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had 12 sacks last season . He was going to return for his senior year , but he found out after the draft he would be academically ineligible . Most scouts predict Williams will earn playing time as a rookie and become a starter by his second season . <p> The Chargers forfeited their second-round pick in the 1999 college draft for Williams . And because they 're expected to be so bad , that should be a high second-round pick . Their No. 1 selection belongs to Arizona . They have an extra No. 2 from Atlanta for receiver Tony Martin . <p> If at first you do n't succeed - The Packers surprised everyone in the league Thursday when they selected Navy offensive tackle Mark Wahle in the second round of the supplemental draft . Their last two No. 1 picks in the regular draft - John Michels and Ross Verba - also were offensive tackles . Michels has been a bust . Verba was very good as a rookie last season . <p> The Packers figure the No. 2 pick they forfeit will be near or at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the risk . He was kicked off the Navy team for testing positive for steroids . He 'll probably end up playing guard . <p> By the way , Auburn strong safety Martavius Houston was not drafted . He would have been the top-rated safety in the country entering his senior year , but he was kicked off the team after testing positive for drugs . <p> The customer 's always right - Because Green Bay , the only publicly owned team in the league , has so many stockholders , it had to have its annual meet at Lambeau Field . The annual shareholders ' meeting last week lured 18,707 . " This is a demonstration of how truly unique this organization is , " Packers president Bob Harlan said . <p> Indeed , only in Green Bay does the general manager have to stand there and answer such questions as , " When are you going to sign Dorsey Levens ? " and " Why did you allow ( cornerback ) Doug Evans to get away ? " But Ron Wolf did it . He even heard this question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wolf laughs and says , " I had to pass on that one . " <p> Overall , a good time was had by all . That 's another thing unique about the organization . <p> Get used to it - Some preseason publications are picking Jacksonville to dethrone Pittsburgh as the AFC Central champion . Not so much because of the players the Steelers lost but because of the potential disruption coach Bill Cowher 's job status might create . Counting 1998 , Cowher has two years left on his contract . He wants an extension starting at $ 2 million a year . He hired Robert Fraley as his agent . <p> Owner Dan Rooney does n't want to pay that much . There have been reports that Cowher wants to become the coach/general manager of the new Cleveland Browns . Another report has surfaced that Cowher will be the leading candidate in Philadelphia if Ray Rhodes is fired after the season . Tom Modrak , the Eagles ' new director of football operations , spent the last decade with the Steelers . Eagles sources say that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it takes if he has a shot at Cowher . <p> Oilers need Air - Tennessee quarterback Steve " Air " McNair agreed to restructure his contract to free up about $ 2 million in cap dollars to help the Oilers sign their draft choices . . . . Oilers free safety Marcus Robertson says this season 's rookie group of defensive backs is " probably the best group they 've brought in since 1991 . " That 's the year Robertson , cornerback Darryll Lewis , cornerback Steve Jackson and safety Mike Dumas were selected by the Oilers . All are still in the league , including Robertson , Lewis and Jackson with the Oilers . . . . After being at war all of last season with the San Diego and national media over closing his practice to reporters , San Diego coach Kevin Gilbride has had a change of heart . The Chargers announced last week that practice will be open . Gilbride had closed it for the first time since the team 's inception in 1960 . <p> World 's largest sports bar - Tampa Bay 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NFL . It costs $ 11 million . The video screens on each end can televise six games at once . They will require 30 technicians working them from a control room that resembles a television studio . Because the stadium is n't finished , the Bucs will play all five preseason games and their first two regular-season games on the road . The home opener is Sept. 20 against Chicago . . . . In case you missed it , the Raiders signed quarterback Wade Wilson , 39 , last week . He 's not insurance for starter Jeff George . He 's insurance for backup Donald Hollas , who has never played regularly in the NFL for an extended period . . . . The NFL had a symposium in Denver recently for every rookie in the league . San Diego quarterback Ryan Leaf missed because he had already committed to a football camp . The league may fine him . Based on the league 's evaluations , Arizona 's rookies were judged the best because they graded well in such categories as interaction , promptness and attentiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A bargain price - As of Friday , such running backs as Raymont Harris , Rodney Hampton , Greg Hill and Terry Kirby , among others , were unsigned . All should end up with teams , but none is getting the kind of money he used to . Right now , Kirby is getting the most interest . Philadelphia , Kansas City and New England are after him . . . . Running back Rashaan Shehee , the Chiefs ' third-round pick , almost drowned when he was 6 . He could n't swim when he fell into a pool , but his cousin saved him . By the time he was 10 , Shehee earned a national ranking in the 50-meter butterfly and 50-meter freestyle . " I try to fight my fears , " he says . " If I fear something , I try to attack it . " . . . Last season , Baltimore center Wally Williams , who is good but not great , earned $ 900,000 . In the offseason , the Ravens designated him as their franchise player , meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's demanding a multiyear deal and threatening not to report . . . . For those who wonder if players would rather get paid or win the Super Bowl , check out Kansas City receiver Andre Rison . After he signed a new contract recently , Rison said , " This is bigger than winning the Super Bowl with Green Bay . I do n't think I was part of that family . I 'm part of this
