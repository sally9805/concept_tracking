In a raucous meeting of the right-wing Likud Central Committee last week , Trade and Industry Minister Ariel ( " Arik " ) Sharon stunned the 3,200 delegates by announcing his resignation from the Cabinet . In a scalding attack against the party 's leader , Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir , Sharon declared that " under your government , Palestinian terrorism runs wild throughout the land of Israel . " He insisted , " I know it is possible to eliminate terror . " <P> Even without Sharon , the peace process remains constrained by Shamir 's own uncompromising ideology . Last week he avoided ruling out the participation of Palestinians deported from the West Bank and Gaza in peace talks but vowed not to include East Jerusalem Arabs . Said Sharon to Israeli television : " I certainly see myself as a candidate for Prime Minister , and when the day comes , I will run for this post . "
