txt // The Business of Worms " I am sure all of you are wondering right now , How is the excrement managed ? " the guide asked in the same officious Madame Mao tone she 'd use for the entire journey through Souzhou . She was leading us through a cracked hothouse filled with hundreds of thousands of silkworms slowly crawling and chewing their way through piles of mulberry leaves . We 'd long ago lost interest in the worms ' sanitary habits ; what we were really wondering was , Why did their boiling pupa smell just like three-day-old fish ? " You know , they should take us to a car plant , " whispered Mr. Elbows . " That 's the trouble with these tours . . . they never take you to the really heavy manufacturing places . " Souzhou is both the Venice and the Ilamptons of China , a little country town just off the thousand-mile-long Grand Canal , lined with waterways and surrounded by rice fields , with local boats , the wapeng , that look just like handmade gondolas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eating luxurious meals and attended to by liveried men in white suits , we looked at our canal neighbors , crammed with potted plants , hanging laundry , cupboards filled with dishes and a half-dozen bicycles , and they looked back at us . For thousands of years , Souzhou has been the preferred spot for the Shanghai creme de la creme to build vacation homes ? weekend retreats of lush , hourly manicured gardens , tiny parks dotted with ponds covered over in patinae of green scum . . . marked with zigzag walkways and bridges . . . shadowed by alcoves of twin bamboo stalks .. . gardens that contain all of nature in a nutshell . The most famous retreat , the Garden of the Master of Fishing Nets , has been poorly re-created with the money of Brooke Astor at New York 's Metropolitan Museum , but the locals were very // proud of this anyway ; they said that their garden now had a New York cousin . You should hurry up and see the original , since , if the Chinese notice it attracting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A silk factory is part greenhouse ( for the propagation of a single plant , the mulberry ) , part chemical processor ( to extract the skin from the pupa ) , and part worm farm . The final building houses the thread machinery itself , which looks like something out of a Dickens Industrial Age horror tinged with a hint of sci-fi . While trays of bobbing cocoons lead to a giant series of spindles ratcheting into bobbins , all kept threaded by busy young girls , you can easily imagine Charlton Heston screaming , " Soylent Green is PEOPLE ! " One measly shirt requires over a thousand of these cocoons . The Friendship Tour of this factory ends with a fashion show featuring annoyed , surly Chinese models photographed by lusting Japanese , followed by the remarkable opportunity to shop for silk fabrics , dresses , blouses , shirts , coats and underpants . . . or ten thousand needlepoint sets of white fluffy kittens . There was an immense bin filled with men 's boxers and I took a pair over to the main cashier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , showed him the package , made a circle around my waist , and shrugged . " I 'm sorry , sir , " he said in a perfect Jeeves English accent , " but we only have them in smalls . " When we were there , Souzhou was the most famous silk producer in all of China . Today , it is the world 's leading manufacturer of computer mice . Outside , on the lawn , the Mormons played catch . Into the Amazon with P.J. O'Rourke and a Headhunting Shaman ( Retired ) 1 here are women who freeze in the headlights of a bou tique window layered in shoes , and there are men who can spend days looking at meaty shelves of hardware or high tech . Everyone has their hungers that must be filled , and it 's travel brochures ( such as National Geographic ) that start me salivatin ' like a Pavlov 's dog .

Hubba-hubba ! Brenda and I booked immediately and took off six weeks later . Why is it that every time you travel south of Mexico , an adventure in chaos begins the minute you hit Miami Inter-national ? While every other part of the terminal is perfectly clean and open , you arrive at the Central and South Ameri46 CRAIG NELSON can carriers ' section to find a maze of circular alleyways that dead-end and lead to nowhere . You struggle onward , desperate to find your ticket booth , lost in a mind-boggling welter of looming banana republics : the friendly skies of Air Poco Loco . . . the welcoming seats of Noriega Express . Our plane to Peru turned out to be on Fawcett Air , and we were all strapped in and high in the clouds when we picked up our guidebooks to learn that Percy Fawcett , the airline 's namesake , was a British colonel who , during the rubber boom of the early 1900s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Percy 's travels ended when he disappeared , never to be heard from again . Instead of a movie , Fawcett the airline had everyone playing bingo for a $100 pot , which was loads of fun until you realized that there you were . . . up in the clouds ... on a plane named for a traveler who went away and never came back . . . and you 're playing a game of chance .. . Many of my friends say they could never take the trips I do because of having to spend so many hours on a plane . I do n't know what they 're talking about . In the air , you can eat , drink , sleep , talk on the phone , work on the computer , read books or magazines , have sex in the bathroom , and watch movies and TV As far as I can see , it 's just like being at home . We arrived in Iquitos baggage claim to find , even at night , that it was hot as hell , and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and onto the cement floor in a Samsonite challenge . Plenty of Iquitenos had arrived with the universal Third World travel accessory ? a thin , red-white-and-blue plastic zippered box big enough to hold a teenager ? and all of these , heaved onto the concrete , were splitting open and spewing laundry everywhere . While waiting for our own bags to arrive and explode , I // studied the vast Iquitos Airport mural , which features emaciated Amazon Indians prancing about with alligators next to an Inca ruin . Brenda and I introduced ourselves to the other Amazon travelers , a Coloradan air traffic controller couple named Tim and Barbara , and a single gentleman named Patrick O'Rourke , who I understood to be the cousin of noted writer and political commentator P.J. O'Rourke . On meeting him , I suavely mentioned how much he looked just like P.J. , but in fact had a much better haircut , and seconds later it became clear that this was P.J. himself in the flesh . It was doubly alarming , not just because I 'd put my whole leg in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be spending our Amazon nights discussing global monetary policy , and the question of who do you think is the most important human being who ever lived : Margaret Thatcher or Ronald Reagan ? We were all herded into a big yellow wooden school bus like the kind a down-at-the-heels Partridge Family might own , and there we met Juan Tejada , our constant companion for the next two weeks . Juan had been trained to lead earnest , authentic norteamericanos on sincere eco-tours , and we 'd run into his more typical clientele in the Miami airport : ten adamantly women-only women , decked out in drawstring cotton pants and faded all-cotton Ts , bralessly trudging along with huge quantities of eco-friendly luggage .. . Amazons on their way to the Amazon . We saw them again on the way home , now stuffed with souvenirs ? a butterfly mounted in a box , a vest made from some animal pelt , a walking stick with a suspicious bit of fur dangling from the tip . Trained for customers like these , Juan would preach to the converted like any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he launched into a vast eco-tirade the minute we got on the bus : // Stretching the same distance as from New York City to Rome , the Amazon River is the world 's second largest after the Nile , carrying twelve times as much water as the Mississippi along with five billion tons of sediment . Its basin , more commonly called Amazonas , is almost the size of the continental United States , and is home to over eight thousand species of insects , over one thousand species of birds , and over 25,000 species of plants , all living in delicate harmony . Perhaps cures for cancer and AIDS and every other human ailment will one day be found here . We are traveling through the city of Iquitos , which was primarily built in the early 1900s during the rubber boom and which soon after suffered financial collapse when it was discovered that the rubber trees could be smuggled out of the country and grown on farms by benevolent Sumatrans instead of being hacked out of the Amazon jungle surrounded by electric catfish and angry cannibals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mind could n't help but wander as Iquitos went rollicking by in the darkness , a city of friendly bars and open-air snack stands and meandering horses and mobs of tuk-tuks ( motor scooters pulling a trailer with a canopied bench inside ) . It all looked like a hell of a lot of fun instead of being the lyrical center of the delicate balance of nature that is the fragile ecosystem of the Amazon . . . and it turned out that all the others on board were thinking the exact same thing . . . except Brenda , who was wondering whether or not this trip would fulfill her personal dream of seeing a three-toed sloth . // They Deserved to Get Cholera Iquitos is once-grand but now down-at-the-heels , a city made and unmade by rubber . During the boom , the locals were so wealthy they sent their laundry to be washed in Paris . It is , in fact , a lot like New Orleans , with a light , airy French colonial architecture of metal filigree balconies and alabaster froufrou . . . but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toxic-blue walls , and streets entirely taken over by tuk-tuks , which sound like a herd of toy lawnmowers drag-racing twenty-four hours a day . " In this town , " one Amazonian remarked , " everything is against the law and everything is permitted . If a policeman asks you for a license or a paper , ask him for his authority to ask . He has n't any . " We wandered around aimlessly , looking in the windows of a cement grocery-bar to see every wall decorated with a Warhol Marilyn , while next door a taxidermy outlet was selling necklaces of toucan bills , baby caiman alligators posed as policemen , and sloths dressed up as North American Indians ( no , I do n't know why ) . Ari 's Burger , painted in screaming red , black , pink and orange horizontal stripes , was the only really happening place on the main drag by that time of night , so that 's where we ended up to get more acquainted and scarf beers . I kept waiting for P.J. to want to talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Romania , but instead he turned out to be a pretty great guy , and the five of us hit it off immediately . The next morning Brenda and I had breakfast surrounded by a coterie of oil company executives in search of a jungle gusher , and then went wandering ourselves in search of the mighty Amazon , which we had n't found the night before . It turned out to be a block away , in the opposite direction . I was expecting something that looked menacing , sinister , // jungly , but in fact the river is broad , flat , with barely a hint of current ; it 's peaceful , suburban . The shore is lined with little cedar tubs , peque peques , the boat version of tuk-tuks , and you see families out on errands together , paddling as a team . There are homes set in small clearings , a few wood buildings with tin roofs , but most with thatch and looking Polynesian . One island was a pasture of gallivanting horses , alert water buffalo and lurking egrets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with the black-and-red-feathered butts of roosting chickens . Just past Iquitos are jungle towns called Indiana , Los Angeles , Texas , Cheyenne , San Francisco and Travolta ? as in John ? while this entire neighborhood is referred to by Peruvians as the " Wild East . " I could n't help but notice the flocks of vultures constantly swooping above the horizon . We had a waterside lunch of the local specialty ( hearts of palm ) in the Iguana Tree Restaurant , dining right next to hanging branches packed with immense , sloven , spiky-green iguanas . The restaurant keeps tossing them leftover fruit , but you could tell that if any more iguanas tried climbing on , the whole tree would fall over into your lap . The restaurant also features a parrot and monkey zoo , and while we were drinking coffee , a very Inca-looking woman with a baby squirrel monkey curled up and asleep on her shoulder came by to sell us kitschy blowpipes . We were only interested in the monkey , but when she tried to move it to her other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infant , and would n't be budged . Besides the tuk-tuks and New Orleans atmosphere , probably the most distinctive part of Iquitos is the odd neighborhood of Belen , an entire city floating in the river on balsa planks . Beier ' looks a lot like Venice ( if Venice were a Spanish jungle slum ) , with houses built from two-by-fours and thatch roofs bobbing up and down in stagnant , clay-colored // water , many having their children 's home roped in tandem with an open-air thatch platform for cooking , drying laundry and sitting around . There are floating stalls of cows and chickens , floating bars , bobbing grocery stores and discos , boats filled with dried fish and produce making their way through the alleys , followed by dugouts , pirogues , barques , rowboats and canoes . Every night , half-naked prostitutes with bow lanterns cruise the byways , canoe taxis driven by five-year-olds search for fares , and younger children play on the porch with parrots and woolly monkeys . There are no property taxes , but you ca n't run away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row away . All it takes is one big storm and the entire town will float down the river , off to Brazil . Juan and the rest of the gang picked us up in our Partridge bus and we went to see the open-air market , which sells everything you can imagine and more ! There 's every kind of fruit and flower in the world , monkeys , coatimundis ( a South American raccoon ) , pirarucus ( a river salmon that can reach ten feet in length ) , peccaries ( a cross between a pig and a deer ) , and one stall selling nothing but various kinds of medicinal bark , all of which , Juan claimed , were good for diarrhea . We did n't see any sign , however , of Iquitos 's current big business : tropical fish . I guess the locals are n't big on aquariums . When you were a child , did your parents have a barbecue pit made from a big oilcan sawed in half ? Mine sure did , and it is exactly in such a container @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is prepared and served on the streets of Peru , including in this violently hot and humid jungle town . In prepping for this trip , I had checked in with the paranoid and suspicious U.S. State Department and Centers for Disease Control on what horrors would await the well coddled in South America , and one of the truly scary announcements , repeated endlessly on both their phone system and their // Web site , was about a Peruvian epidemic of cholera . We got to Iquitos , and found out that all this came from a group of tourists who 'd eaten street-marinated ceviche out of those rusty oilcans . We could only think : Anyone that stupid deserves to get cholera . If you 've never used the Federal Centers for Disease Control Voice and Fax Information System ( 404-332-4555 as of right now ) , it 's a must-hear , even if you never go anywhere . My favorite part is when a very chirpy , all-American voice rings out : " Press One for AIDS ! Press Two for Malaria ! Press Three for Sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meningococcal Infections ! Press Six for Yellow Fever ! " The Douche of Death To get to our jungle camp that afternoon , we five Anglos were loaded onto a big , wooden , thatch-roofed partyboat that launched out on the main highway , the flat green Amazon , which branches into smaller rivers like side streets , and then into streams like alleyways . The boat had a stern toilet , a closet with a wooden plank and a hole in its middle , perched directly over the Evinrudes . It is quite frightening if you 're well endowed ; P.J. called it " the douche of death . " Then the boat started pulling deeper and deeper away from civilization and into the jungle , the trees moving in closer and closer , the rivers narrowing into thin , barely passable trickles . Beneath us swam pira ranha , Tupi for " fish tooth , " the most vicious of them all being the red- or yellow-bellied meat-eating nattereri found throughout the continent with // " teeth so sharp and jaws so strong that it can chop out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neatly as a razor , or clip off a finger or toe , bone and all , with the dispatch of a meat cleaver , " as ichthyologist George Myers so delicately put it . Their highest concentration is found in Brazil 's Rio das Mortes ? the River of Death ? cleaning out every piece of meat that hits the water , like aquatic vultures . When piranha in a school sense one of their mates in trouble , they start taking out chunks of him in a cannibalistic feeding frenzy . The Amazonians , however , are far more afraid of the big-scarred , slow-healing , extremely painful lance of the stingray than they are of piranha bites , and in fact Indian fishermen wading through the waters will shuffle instead of step in order to scare off any lurking rays . Ray poison is so strong and so painful that its sting will even make the Jivaro headhunters cry like babies . Learning this made me feel good , since my wallet was made out of stingray . Before going to the Amazon , you hear the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bounty of nature . But in fact no one , not even the most remote and shyest of the Indians , lives all that deep into the rain forest itself ; it is too impenetrable , and any attempts at making a clearing and a home are doomed . Everyone instead lives right on the water in a house on stilts with a boat to get around in , and they call themselves riverenos , " river people . " There are no jungle people , since the jungle trees are covered with vines and epiphytes and mosses and every kind of floral parasite , while the ground is a ceaseless bog , with vast stretches underwater much of the year . There are electric eels , toothy caimans , cranky fer-de-lance , camouflaged stingrays , menacing anacondas , masses of piranha , prowling jaguar and hissing , twelve-foot bushmasters , whose poison is so strong that a good , deep bite can render antivenin worthless . This is nature at its most exuberant and explosive , all of it feeding on // each other , and whether you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the equatorial rain forest has one thing it whispers in the ear of every human who dares draw nigh , and that is : " GET OUT . " The Brazilians tried shipping would-be farmers out of the crowded city slums and into this vast emptiness , and it was an all-out catastrophe . With soil too thin even for cattle grazing , constant epidemics of plant disease , hosts of tenacious weeds , attacks by browsing wild animals , and no economical way to bring produce to market , this is not exactly a spot for traditional ranchers and farmers to make a living ? the Indians who 've lived here for eons barely scrape by . The twentieth century may have conquered everything from Everest to the moon to the deep seas , but vast portions of the Amazon wilderness remain untouched . We arrived at dusk to find our home in the middle of nowhere , a camp of elevated walkways and thatch-covered dormitories lit by warmly romantic hurricane lamps , with a lodge-cum-dining room that was high-roofed and breezy . There , up in the beams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and a toucan hopped around , eyeing us . Huge bunches of small , overripe bananas hung down from the eaves , and the toucan ripped one up and began to gobble . Tiring of that , he hopped down to the backs of our rattan chairs , and his big black beak made us more than a little nervous . Then , before we knew what was happening , he leaped onto the table and went from glass to glass , sticking his banana-smudged mouth deep into our drinks . As we watched bits of unidentifiable toucan leftovers float in our glasses , Juan explained that plenty of times guests would turn their backs , and the toucans would drink down their rum and then run around , plotzed . Amazonistas love their parrots , and the kitchen featured an orphan baby toucan that hissed like a snake when // strangers approached . Its featherless head made it look just like a very ugly dinosaur . On the roof lurked a pair of jadegreen Amazon parrots , hopping back and forth in their seriously clownish walk , climbing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scales and pieces of opera and screaming out their names ( " LOR RA ! LOR RA ! " ) and then laughing like asylum inmates . Brenda opened her door to let two macaws walk around and check out her room , which they did , looking for things to chew , and immediately swallowing her camera button . She had to take all her pictures on the rest of the trip using a safety pin . That night and every night in the jungle , we slept under canopy shrouds of mosquito netting , and I had a nightmare about the Museum of Natural History , a nightmare that I was inside a vitrine , while a ravenous host of bugs of every shape , color and size swarmed over the cage 's glass walls , trying to get in . This nightmare turned out , in fact , to be real : I woke up needing to pee , and turned on my flashlight to find a madding host of insects crawling across the outsides of my mosquito netting ... emerald shiny beetles and hairy spiders , fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and colonies of doodlebugs , giant red-legged centipedes and big black hornets , and of course , hungry tiger mosquitoes . Like every night , it was pouring rain outside , so I carefully lifted up my netting , making sure none of these vermin could get in my bed , got a poncho and a flashlight , and started walking to the latrines . With each step , creatures nestling by the path scurried away noisily , and I jumped right out of my goddamn skin . It 's eco-embarrassing to admit this but , from then on , at night in the torrential rains , I peed out the window . Traffic noise in New York City is nothing compared to the peeping bugs , screeching birds and high-pitched whistling frogs of the rain forest . If you 're a light sleeper , you 'll need // to bring earplugs . Dawn comes with the agitated squawking of lovebirds , and I woke up at first light because some damn animal was screaming right outside the window . After everyone else got up and ate , we went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smack dab into a mud bog , sinking two feet . I washed those boots and left them out to dry for a week , but in all that humidity , they never did . Every single day it would rain , a giant warm mist , while every night there 'd be pounding thunderstorms . They do n't call it the rain forest for nothing . We hiked by plenty of silk-cotton ceiba trees , with thorny trunks hard as stone and branches covered in epiphytes , especially the flowering bromeliads , beautiful , primitive and parasitic . Living inside these blooms were lady tree frogs who attracted their mates by giggling like psychopathic villains . There were tribes of leaf-cutter ants , hoisting their greenery along a trail , butterflies with owl eyes on their wings , white-faced tamarin monkeys , dripping birds of paradise , giant ferns , sweat bees , a black branch covered in giant white fungus , and a grasshopper as big as a man 's hand . There was one tree so completely covered in houseplants that you could n't even see the bark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , snakeplants , philodendrons and Boston ferns . Always , just out of reach , is the sound of the birds , cooing and yakking and screaming , along with the croak of cicadas and the harsh whistles of the frogs . But these sounds are n't with you , like in other forests ; they are muffled and distant , almost as if you 're merely remembering them . Keeping your eyes peeled for wildlife , like hunting , makes you hyperaware of your surroundings . . . even so , I never found a thing . Tim and Barbara , however , discovered a walking stick , a great big one with a missing leg , and Brenda instantly knew the cause : " Poachers ! " On our walks , Juan continued to explain how this bark , or // that root , or this leaf , was good for diarrhea , and he 'd also point out the many , many things you could eat in the jungle if you were really hungry . He 'd show us a snake and say , " Some people eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What does it taste like , Juan ? " and he 'd say , " It tastes something like chicken . " He 'd point out a lizard and say , " Some people eat this lizard , " and we 'd say , " What does it taste like , Juan ? " and he 'd say , " It tastes something like chicken . " He 'd point out an iguana and say , " Some people eat this iguana , " and we 'd say , " What does it taste like , Juan ? " and he 'd say , " It tastes something like chicken . " Finally P.J. had had enough : " If all these things taste like chicken , " he demanded to know , " then why do n't they just eat a chicken ? " Juan turned especially energetic when he found a tarantula burrow , poking every entry with a stick , trying to get the spiders to show themselves . No matter how much we protested that we did n't care to watch a family of angry tarantulas running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rouse a single one of the monsters . We came home , Juan dejected , only to find a horde of big , hairy tarantulas climbing the barroom screens . One ii Snooty Rodent The minute we got back , one of the camp kids came over and started pulling on Brenda 's hand ; he spoke a version of Spanish I could n't make out , so we followed him , not knowing what would happen . He led us over to an open section of the walkway where a telescope had been set up ; he pointed excitedly , and Brenda put her eye to the viewer to find the one thing she 'd been looking for all day : a three-toed sloth . // I went back to get beer for me and tea for her and the rest of the gang , and we looked through the scope for hours , watching the sloth not moving . Then Juan arrived and let out a piercing whistle ( hawks and eagles being the sloth 's enemies ) , and the creature turned an ovoid face to peer down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never realized before how there 's no distinction between where a sloth 's neck ends and its head begins ; there 's no chin , no nape , just a long , hairy tube with a face on the end of it , like a warmblooded worm . We wanted our sloth to do even more , and so started making every kind of whistle and grunt a human being can create , like rude teens in a pet store pounding on the terrariums . Very , very slowly , the sloth started moving , while Juan explained that it had six-inch-long fingernails for digging out grubs , that its pelt was a " bug carpet " of beetles , ticks , fleas and moths , and that it comes down from the trees once a week to take a shit . P.J. assumed this was because it 'd been eating all those things that were so good for diarrhea , while Brenda imagined a sloth circus , entertainment for the overstimulated , where every trick took hours to perform . The kitchen turned out to be the place to hang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp had no electricity , it did have a big Frigidaire , and the cook would dutifully bring in baskets of produce ( especially masses of papaya ) and carefully place them inside . Like all Arnazonites , the staff believed that papaya is a magical fruit that can cure most human ailments and ensure good health , and they think you should eat a lot of it . Besides the baby toucan dinosaur , the kitchen was also home to a pet mouse opossum , tiny and long-nosed , with pink ears and huge round black eyes , and an acid-blue-andyellow poison-spitting tree frog carrying tadpoles on his back . Juan finally realized that the four of us were n't here to // ooh and ahh over this frog 's caring-and-sharing as he ferried his children about ; we wanted to know how the Jivaro headhunters used the frog 's poison in their blowpipes . ( After we came home , Abbott Labs in Chicago would announce that they 'd successfully extracted a painkiller from this frog that was as powerful as morphine , but without being addictive . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tree frogs take the prize . They are legion , found all over the insides of flowers and the undersides of leaves , they emit a range of creepy , irritating cries , grunts , moos , barks , clicks and whistles twenty-four hours a day , and they have gelatinous , refulgent skin , so strongly colored it looks irradiated . When I 'd been planning this trip and showed my assistant Lauren a National Geographic survey about them , her only response was , " Why do you want to go to a place where the frogs spit poison at you ? " The ultimate kitchen pet was Marguerita , an orphan capybara and the world 's largest rodent ; at 140 pounds , she looked like a cross between a hamster and a German shepherd . Like hippos , capybaras are awkward and goofy on land , but have webbed feet and can tear through the water ; their local nickname is water hog . They are the preferred Easter dish throughout South America , a jungle ham , and on the plains of Venezuela , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Out on the boat we 'd seen Marguerita moving through the water like a shark , and Juan told us how she was very taken with men . One day , two German couples went swimming , and were rolling around in the water , playing romantically . Marguerita watched from the shoreline until she could n't stand it anymore . She dove in , made a beeline for the women , and bit them on the butt . When the water pig made her dawn and dusk appearances at camp , she 'd almost purr // when getting stroked by men , but when women tried petting her , she kept inching away . . . one giant snooty hamster . Cesar , a student of chiroptera , was working down the trail , and after dinner we went to see him . He 'd strung a net woven from fishing line about six feet up , and it was completely invisible at dusk ( which we found out quickly enough by bumping into it ) . Cesar and his interns were studying population density , so after catching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd come just in time for a release . First up was a nectar-eater with a big spiked nose and a long skinny tongue ; it looked like a sweet little terrified mouse with wings . The next was an insecteater , and even for a bat it was ugly as hell , with a giant convoluted nose and ears like devil 's horns , but it , too , was terrified , and barely moved a muscle until being set aloft . The last specimen was ready for a fight . . . big , vicious , snarling , struggling , showing its jaws and snapping , frantically squirming its wings and sporting a pink chiroptera hardon . This was the Jamaican fruit-eater , and in his honor we created the Jamaican Fruit-Eating Bat Dance , which goes like this : Put your arms straight out , and wiggle ' em ; Snap your head from side to side ; Gnash your teeth and snarl like the demon ; Shake your body like a roller-coaster ride . When Juan saw us trying to get everyone in camp to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain forest " bit , and from then on it was bungle in the jungle , baby . The next morning , we were back on the river with a special mission . Thousands of parakeets went screeching above our heads , followed by chattering parrot couples , and peeping chacalaca . In the trees were hawks , woodpeckers and a // pair of great horned spectacle owls , while on the shore , cormorants , ibis and egret were prowling around . Our boat was followed for some time by morpho butterflies the size of a child 's head , fluttering silky , acid-blue , almost too much to look at . We motored past a pool , black as fresh oil , covered in ten-foot lily pads , a landscape out of Jurassic Park . At sunrise and sunset , there on the water , the Amazon sky arches with hope , peace and beauty ; at night , if you are out on the river and the way is clear , you are guaranteed to see the spreading Milky Way in all its lactic glory . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreboding , a dark , brutal heat and wetness combined with the crush of approaching thunderstorms . It hangs over you , menacing and oppressive , threatening and mighty . At any minute , you , puny mortal , will be drenched , either with rain or with sweat , and only the petulant sky gods will decide your fate . We were on the river looking for the famed Amazon dolphins , which are pink , and we motored to their favorite part of the Napo River and then , like all wildlife expeditions , waited and waited and waited . Finally Juan mentioned that when the cetacean researchers were here , they 'd played jazz to summon the mighty beasts , but our group 's jazz expertise was this side of nil , so we tried the music we knew . Elvis .. . Nothing . Billie Holiday .. . Zip . Rolling Stones .. . Forget it . U2 ... Zilch . Finally , I thought , " Why not some Judy Collins treacle ? " and launched into " Both Sides Now . " By verse four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P.J. wondered if it // was the Joni Mitchell influence and so tried " Woodstock , " but this caused the animals to dive precipitously . We went back to " Both Sides Now , " and worked our way through the full Collins oeuvre with terrific results ; there must have been a dozen pink dolphins surfacing , sticking up their noses and swimming all around us . P.J. observed , " Well they may be pretty , but they 've sure got lousy taste in music . " One minute it was sunny and cloudless , and the next , a torrent of biblical proportions rained down upon us . After getting completely soaked , we took refuge in the nearest village 's meetinghouse , where P.J. , Tim and I stocked up on the locals ' handmade rum , starting what would become our group tradition : The Tasting Tour . We 'd repay the hospitality of the riverenos while savoring the product of the local stills . Our favorite turned out to be a mix of sugarcane rum and honeycomb drunk by newlyweds . . . a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were bartering , the kids showed Brenda and Barbara their pets : just-horn bunnies , and tortoises , and preteen agouti ( a half-rodent , half-pig kind of thing ) . One small girl then brought out her very large and very flapping pet bat , holding it by the wings as it struggled to escape , while we said " aah ! " and " ooh ! " It was n't so hard to appreciate a bat in the same room with you , gnashing its teeth , after just a few of those " break open the underpants " specials . The rain cleared off , and the kids started playing soccer , so P.J. , being the sporty member of our group , played with them . We changed his name to Pele O'Rourke , and later he confided he was doing this to catch the eye of the village 's comely young schoolmistress , but instead only caught a case of the chiggers . This led to his new theory : You go to the Great Outdoors to commune with Nature , but all you come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the river , we 'd bump into people // here doing God-knows-what , such as Roger , an ignorant right-winger who trained U.S. troops for Vietnam in his prime but who now led a family of snotty , holier-than-thou Jehovah 's Witnesses . The real compelling expat , though , was Linnea , a rail-thin Scandinavian who looked like she just stepped out of an especially angst-ridden Ingmar Bergman epic . Linnea was a doctor who 'd come on an eco-tour , saved a boy from a fer-de-lance bite , and now would n't leave . She was called La Doctora , and she had a brand-new clinic built by Missouri Rotarians , a clinic suffering from constant problems with mold and tropical rot . Even her microscope kept developing an internal fungus . What was the Sean Connery movie where he was a doctor in the jungle and discovered the cure for cancer from ant butts in the sugar ? That 's just what Linnea was like : frantic , compulsive and frightening , saintly and obsessed , admirable , but a little beyond the pale . She 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tablespoon , but other patients had died from too much antibiotic , and the Peruvian government was giving her trouble with both her medical license and her residency visa . Linnea also had a continuous problem in that all the local boys brought her any wild thing they could catch , from capybara to monkeys to snakes . They thought she 'd buy them , since they 'd heard that Americans will turn anything into a pet . " Good-bye , Animals ! " About a mile from camp lived the Yagua , Amazon Indians who 'd set up a faux primitif re-creation of their traditional village for eco-tourists to come visit . There they would get // dressed up in grass skirts , headdresses and facepaint , and shoot blowguns for us . . . but obviously they could n't wait to get back to their T-shirts and khaki shorts . The Yagua did n't use cash , and so had a trading system where tourists could relinquish their South Park and Simpsons T-shirts in exchange for jewelry and wood carvings and intricately carved bowls . At first we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear : one piece of American clothing got you one Yagua item . There were German tourists there along with us , demanding in their delicate German fashion for the Yagua to blowgun some monkeys out of the trees . They became so fevered with shopping that they stripped to their underpants to trade all their clothes away . The chief , wearing a ratty thatch skirt , tried demonstrating his blowgun abilities , but missed the target again and again . He offered Tim a chance , and Tim nailed it on the second shot . Barbara , meanwhile , was getting away with two Yagua items per Rocky Mountain High T-shirt . I like going to places where I can use my odd Spanish , which I learned in a ' Icxas high school from an Iberian noblewoman expatriate . My accent is like hers , snooty and prickly , and I used to be fluent , but so many years have passed that I 've forgotten huge patches , and so have invented a new kind of Spanish surrealismo , where I just say whatever half-remembered vocabulary pops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I engineered the customers into a skunk-drunk English lesson , those bombed and bleary campesinos learning such key American phrases as " Me gusta comer sus dedos " ( " I want to eat your fingers " ) and " Dame un desayuno de huevos y grabadores , por favor " ( " Please bring me a plate of eggs and tape recorders " ) . In turn , they taught me the key drinking phrase in Peru : " Esta noche es la noche ! " ( " Tonight 's the night ! " ) . // I decided to use my language method to now tell the Yagua children a story : Those Germans and the Coloradans are not like you and me . They are one-half people , and one-half animals . Every morning they come down from their mountain homes , and do you know what they eat for breakfast ? They eat cats , and dogs , and even parrots ! Watch them , and you will see how strange they are ! The children sat , listening to me , open-mouthed and spellbound . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accent was getting through to the Yagua , especially since I 'd found out that every time I thought I was asking for an ashtray in restaurants I 'd instead been telling the waitress to bring me an elevator . But then , as we were leaving , the entire tribe yelled out : Adios , animales ! " The itch Gives Us a Drink There was another part of the camp that was truly extraordinary . If your genius architect father built you the world 's greatest collection of Swiss Family Robinson treehouses and had them all connected with rope ladders and bridges , you 'd have something like the Canopy Walkway , which was constructed for scientists and eco-tourists to glimpse the difference in life from the ground to the treetops , about two hundred feet up . Of course it was pretty up in the trees , and if you looked hard enough you could spot birds and lizards and opossum and a few houseplants you had n't seen yet , but mainly running around those rope bridges was as much fun // as anything out of Disney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the local form of acid . One of the camp 's neighbors was Antonio , a Jivaro brujo , a male witch , a shaman . Everyone was thrilled to meet a reallife shaman , while I was thrilled to meet a real-life Jivaro , the cannibals who invented shrunken heads . Antonio offered to give us a cleansing ceremony , and Brenda and Barbara , the only semi ? New Agers in the group , jumped at the chance . This ceremony turned out to be Antonio chanting ( a chant which is re-created , perhaps by Antonio himself , on the Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia " Shaman " entry ) while he brushed us down with a hand broom made of twigs , which rustled like castanets ; between the chant and the rustle , it was really hypnotic . He told Brenda she was a vegan ( which was true ) and that I was telepathic ( which who knows ? ) , and that to excuse yourself to use the toilet in the Amazon you say , " I have to see a man about a dog . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blew the smoke over every inch of our bodies . Boy did we feel clean ! That night after dinner , I bought some clabohuasca , a rum made from " the vine of life , " ayahuasca , the drug Amazon shamans use to approach the divine . If you 've ever known a big-time acid freak , these were the eyes Antonio had ; seemingly unfocused and distracted ; googly eyes , and he explained how he 'd been trained : I stopped eating animals . And then I stopped eating fish . And then I stopped eating oil . And then I stopped eating sugar . And then I stopped drinking coffee . And then I stopped smoking tobacco . I went on this diet and got real , real skinny . And then I took the ayahuasca , which made me throw up everything , so I was clean . And then it gave me visions and sounds , and those // things were just as good as lunch . When you have the ayahuasca , everything shows you pictures or gives you words , the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's just like going to school . We of course could n't wait to try it , even though there was the threat of " puking to see the future " involved , and so only some of us took the plunge ( now of course I ca n't remember who ) . After drinking it for some time , I thought , " This is n't doing a thing , " and then a minute later I said , " Have you guys ever noticed how beautiful the ceiling here is ? . . . Do n't you think the colors of the candle flames here are really different from how they look in the U.S. ? " and that 's when we realized that now would be the perfect time to run through the Canopy Walkway . This walkway is tons of fun all by itself but at night , stoked on **25;2056;TOOLONG and clabohuasca , it is totally fabulous . You run across the rope bridges and climb higher and higher into the air , at the peak seeing a perfectly clear sky above the treetops , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big fat reclining Orion . I had ( and this was true since one verified non-huasca drinker saw it ) an extended " so 's your mother ! " conversation with a bullfrog : Me : " Earp . " Frog : " Earp . . . EARP . " Me : " EARP . . . earp earp . " Frog : " EARP . . . earp earp . " Me : " Earp earp EARP earp ! " Frog : " Earp earp EARP earp ! EARP ! " P.J. and Tim , however , were not having such a good time on the walkway , and we had to coax them down . Bummer , man . // A Home at the Top of the World Next morning , Brenda and I bid a fond " adios , animales ! " ourselves and flew off to Qosqo ( or Cuzco , which means " Belly Button of the World " ) for a week of running around the Andes with our translator , a hearty Robert Mitchum type named Wilbur . In the jungle , Juan had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , up in the mountains , Wilbur obsessively discoursed in grave detail on his favorite topic : Peruvian agricultural history . He desperately wanted to make sure Brenda and I were fully informed about every aspect of Inca cultivation methods , especially as it pertained to a subject he found endlessly fascinating : the potato . The Inca created terraced farmland , their own topsoil , and developed something like seventeen thousand different kinds of potatoes , and through Wilbur , we learned about every single one of them . Moving in six hours from Amazon ( sea level ) to Cuzco ( sixteen thousand feet up ) hit me with a bad case of soroche ? altitude sickness ? blinding headaches , dizziness and extreme nausea . It was especially uncomfortable , since Wilbur kept nattering on and on about potatoes . Peruvians cure soroche with coca leaves , leathery green and resinous , and about as delicious as a plate of wet pine needles . Brenda and I chewed and chewed , but it did nothing for the soroche , and we could n't even get a little buzz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had about as much effect . Since many Andeans chew a pound of leaves a day , however , we knew we must be missing out on something , and so kept lugging troves of leaves with us everywhere . In the Andes , all the good restaurants have dozens and dozens of plastic bags filled with water ( just like the ones you take goldfish home in ) hanging from the ceiling . This , // they say , keeps away flies , and why this would work I do n't know , but it sure seems to . There are branches of eucalyptus in the rest rooms ( organic air-fresheners ) and stone fences topped with growing cactus plants ( organic barbed wire ) and various llamas and their relatives trolling around . Today in the U.S. , ranchers are stocking up on guard llamas , since these animals are so inquisitive that , if they 're standing around with a herd of sheep and a coyote shows up , the llama will immediately run over to investigate . The would-be predator , seeing a three-hundred-pound llama charging straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were so important to the Inca that their empire extended only to where the beasts ( along with their cousins , the fat , dumb waddling alpaca and the lean , neurotic supermodel vicuna ) could be raised . Besides llamas , the Inca were crazy about mummies , and they kept their entire ruling family of ancestors mummified in Qosqo . The mummies received daily meals , were consulted by oracles , and the entire royal mummy family would be taken out on festive occasions , paraded around town , and brought to revisit the places they 'd enjoyed when alive . Being a high-class Inca ( even a live one ) was a pretty good deal , since the nobility were allowed multiple wives , vicuna wool , chaws of coca leaf , golden earplugs and cloaks made from vampire bat skins . Leaving Qosqo , we drove straight through the Urubamba Valley , Incaland , with views as beautiful an alpine dream as anything out of The Sound of Music . That the Andes were so relentlessly beautiful stunned me , and I looked around , my mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purple fields of quinoa , towns roofed in red-clay tiles and waterfalls meandering down a granite precipice . We stopped for a visit in one of the greatest places ever , Willoq , a village where people still live exactly as they have for cen70 CRAIG NELSON turies . The Willoqians are Quechua , completely uninfiltrated by the Spanish , and they are fantastic looking , with half-tan and half-red skin , broad noses , full lips and tight almond eyes . . . and just like the Inca , they would n't dream of appearing in public without a hat . The village is a sea of sombreros and stovepipes , homburgs and porkpies , bowlers , panamas , derbies and fedoras , ski caps , bonnets , pillboxes and mantillas , and even wimples and snoods . . . always framing long , black , tightly braided pigtails and ponytails . The women 's bodies are swathed in flowing serapes and big , pleated , flouncy black skirts , and on their backs are papoosed , grimy babies , bundled up and topped with knitwoollen caps . Inside their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing with ducks and hogs , and listened to the peep-peep-peeping of the cuy . Spit-roasted cuy , or guinea pig , has been a key Andean treat since before time began , and every Willoq house is filled with scurrying herds of these shy rodents . It would be as if you kept packs of wild mice running around the floors of your living room . In Qosqo 's main cathedral , there 's even a giant painting of the Last Supper with Jesus and his disciples preparing to chow down on a platter of fresh guinea pig . Peruvians , though , feel a little queasy about foreigners ' interest in this , so you tragically are n't allowed to take a picture , or even buy a postcard , of the Last Supper with Guy . Juan had said we should n't even bother going out of our way to eat guinea pig , since it tastes just like chicken . Machu Picchu , our ultimate destination , is one of those incredible places in the world that I think everyone has a duty to go look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We must go and see for ourselves " locales . It is here that the lazy , broad Urubamba River turns into a mountain torrent , and you walk a rickety wooden footbridge over those waters to catch a bus , which crosses back and forth in switchbacks // to get to the top . This ride is the essence of " vertiginous , " for no matter which side of the bus you sit on , your window is guaranteed to have many lovely vistas of the road 's shoulders : sudden drops into a watery abyss . In practically every picture of Machu Picchu , the backdrop is always this soft , green mountain called Huayna Picchu , and we saw some hearty German grandmothers hitting the trail to climb it , and assumed we should , too . This turned out to be one of the worst ideas I ever had in my life : mountainclimbing , in old , worn-smooth sneakers , lugging cameras and binoculars ( and no water ) on my back . Yes , once you get to the top there 's a staggering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geometry now made plain . What you climb , however , is the ancient Inca trail , and instead of actually climbing , we had to crawl up on our hands and knees , scrambling over dripping-wet , slippery , giant boulders , for what seemed like an eternity in hell . After we get to the top , completely soaked in sweat ( and looking like we just escaped from a South American prison ) , it started to pour rain . So we had to go back down , again on our hands and knees , sliding and slipping all over the place . Twice , I slid across the wet stone and grass and landed inches from the precipice . Wilbur looked on , horrified , but he waited till we were all the way back down to explain that just a few months back , a Japanese woman had stepped aside to let some other climbers get by , and fell nine hundred feet to her death . Machu , though , is worth risking your life to see . The archaeology , the ruins themselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peephole windows , dizzying stairways , aqueducts and farming terraces climbing up the mountains , all now covered in grass , are n't as dramatic or as beautiful as Luxor , or Tikal , or Chichen Itza , or many other ancient places . . . but the site ! Everywhere you turn is a // breathtaking view , an entire landscape of refuge and peace , a home at the top of the world . As we gazed around , breathless , Wilbur would come over to show us various items that fascinated him : some fern leaves , an orchid , a giant red-legged centipede , a dead ferde-lance . He 'd pick up one rock after another and say , " Hey ! This one looks just like a condor ! " or " Look over here ! This one looks just like a crab . " None of these rocks looked like any of these things , and , much to his dismay , there were no potatoes . The next morning , we rode the scary bus to see Machu again , at dawn . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . The green peaks would suddenly loom , vague and blurry , into view , their bases entwined with the glinting brown Urubamba , threads of mist drifting below and between the valley floors . We 'd see nothing of the city , and then the wind would pick up , and bits would materialize , only to vanish again . It was all twice as mysterious as in broad daylight , and twice as beautiful . Every archaeologist and cultural anthropologist seems to have a different theory as to what Machu Picchu was during Inca times . Some say country retreat , others coca farm , and still others think it was a religious ceremonial site . When you are there , this last idea is the one that takes hold , for no matter what it may have been originally , today 's Machu is indisputably a sacred place . Whatever religion or spiritual practice you may believe , at this mountaintop , you are guaranteed to believe more of it . When the Black Land Was the First World 1 raveling to odd places regularly gets me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and home-grown . I 've run into my share of horrors ? like China 's Baby Jane ? but I 've also met plenty of terrific guys and gals , including Melissa , the bicycle-riding pharmacist . A few years after coming home from Shanghai , Melissa decided to go on a round-the-world tour , and she called me up and said , " You know , one of my stops will be Egypt , and it 's just the greatest and you ca n't miss it , so why do n't you meet up with me there and I 'll take you around ? " I 'd never really thought about going back to the Middle East after a trip to Marrakech where it looked like I was going to be murdered , but she made it sound so easy . To this day I still remember packs of grizzled men in robes chasing us , shaking their fists while screaming in guttural Arabic , along with every detail of the airlines of the Middle East . My NYC ? Cairo flight followed the Arab tradition of smoking // sections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the right . The minute the door closed , however , everyone on board ( including the kids ) started puffing away frantically . By the time our aircraft began its descent , a third of the cabin was lighting one cigarette after another , a third was spritzing themselves with cologne and hairspray , and another third was doing both at the same time . As every speck of air was obliterated , the non-cologne-wearing nonsmokers started gasping , and I could only wonder : How many airplane explosions in the Middle East have been because of terrorists , and how many have started from the combustible union of Aqua Net and Lucky Strike ? I 'd taken a ton of books on ancient Egypt with me to prep for this trip , and when I was n't praying for the oxygen masks to drop , I read all about what we 'd be doing and where we 'd be going . This turned out to be quite disturbing , since almost every page had some bizarre fact that was impossible to believe . The history , the culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy , so out there . Then I got to Egypt and found out : It was all true . Out There Do you remember the end of Close Encounters of the Third Kind , when Richard Dreyfuss abandons his wife and kids in order to climb aboard a spaceship and take off for another galaxy ? ( We can only hope he was n't running off with those extraterrestrials who abduct pregnant Montana farm girls and give them extensive anal probes . ) The success of Close Encounters proves just how many people around the world believe it would be peachy-keen to run off with outer space // aliens , and I think you might be one of them . . . in fact , I think that you 'd do anything for a chance to meet extraterrestrials . There 's wonderful news , though , since you no longer have to get pregnant and go lurking around Montana in order to experience the culture of life from another world . You just have to go to Egypt . No matter how strange , peculiar , bizarre and disturbing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they ca n't possibly top what was going on fifty centuries ago in the Nile Valley . The ancient Egyptians did n't call their country Egypt ( like we do ) or Misr ( like the modern Egyptians do ) but Kemet , " The Black Land , " meaning good soil for crops . If you close your eyes and try to imagine what Egypt looks like ... do n't you imagine sand-swept , dusty , crumbling pyramids , or parched Bedouins leading their camels across the endless dunes ? The people of Kemet , in fact , hated the desert and called it Teshert , " The Red Land , " a chaotic , hellish , terrifying place filled with horrible monsters ruled by Set , a god with the head of an unknown , long-snouted animal , big jackal ears , and a forked tail . . . a god who would later become the Christian beast Satan . The ancient Egyptians thought of themselves as river people . Their lives revolved around the Nile , whose current runs north but whose winds blow south , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact , that at the time of the building of the Great Pyramid , the Egyptians still had n't come up with the wheel . They just loved boats , designing hundreds of varieties , even developing a barge that was sewn together with string . Kemet was a land of rafts and ferries and tugs and sloops , and even today , no matter where you turn , that big river is there , feeding the landscape with strips of canals and creating , in the middle of nowhere , a lush farmland that 's just right for growing the cotton we prefer in our underpants. // The people of Kemet spent a lot of time on boats and a lot of time in the bathroom , since all of them , male and female , children and adults , were wild about cosmetics . Makeup was thought to be magically alive with healing powers , so they wore a lot of it : orange or yellow henna fingernail polish , black kohl mascara and eyeliner , gray lead or green malachite eyeshadow , and red ocher blush and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from human or goat hair ) were extremely popular , while both sexes wore every kind of jewelry they could come up with : bracelets , anklets , armbands , headbands , pierced earrings , chokers , necklaces , pectorals , multiple crowns , rings on their fingers and bells on their toes . At big parties , they wore cones of pressed flowers and grease on their heads ( which took all night to melt and run down their faces ) to make sure no one could smell any body odor , which they thought was completely repulsive . Young boys were shaved bald , except for one thatch of hair that was woven into a braid like a Chinese topknot , while bald men rubbed their heads with hedgehog fat , and the high priests went about draped in panther skins . Taking all this into consideration , it could be easily said that the Egyptians were the Michael Jacksons of the ancient world . Their outfits and makeup may have been distinctive , but it 's in the religion department where these guys really went nuts , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science-fiction master could dream up . You 're probably already familiar with the more common , run-ofthe-mill Egyptian gods , such as the ones with a human body and the head of a jackal , ibis or baboon . The Kemetians also worshipped Taweret , the god of pregnancy , who has the head of a wig-wearing hippopotamus , the tail of a crocodile , the hands of a lion and the body of a fat old woman ; as well as fertility god Min , who wears mummy wraps and a feather hat , while flinging a cat-o ' - nine- tails and sporting a big erecLET 'S // don . Min 's sacred plant ( and preferred offering ) is a head of lettuce . The oddly global worship of cows ( much more on this later ) is here in the form of Hathor ( hat whore ) , the bullhorned goddess of health , who allows reigning pharaohs to nurse from her sacred udders . Like Greek and Roman gods ( who inherited the idea ) , Egyptian deities could manifest themselves as various animals , with bulls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most popular . The system was ridiculously unfair ; Thoth , for example , could be either an ibis or a baboon , while poor Sepa could only manifest himself as a millipede . Spiritual Offal Our trip , like every trip to Egypt , began with a landing in El Qahira , or Cairo , a city whose buildings are the color of old , tired shoes , and whose air is humid , sullen and permeated with a dun-brown talc , a dust that coats everything . You get around in taxis , and I was only too happy to let Melissa do all the dirty work , a half-hour of dramatic negotiations three times a day that could easily drop the price from $3.50 to 75 . At that time , the metropolitan slaughterhouses were still at the dead center of downtown , meaning that any food source that could walk to its ultimate destination did so , causing unimaginable traffic snarls . Besides doomed herds of goats and cattle , the streets were filled with professional child beggars , most with missing fingers or congenital deformities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you have to go to Cairo , you should at least stay in a palace , and ours was built by the Khedive Ismail in 1869 to put up the international jet set arriving for the premiere of // Aida and the opening of the Suez Canal . Melissa explained , " The last time I came to Cairo , I stayed here , too , only then it was filled with unbelievably rich sheiks and their families . I 'd go out into the gardens , and they 'd be mobbed with the kids driving around in little battery-powered jeeps , with Fil ipino nannies chasing after them . The Saudi women did n't wear the usual head scarves , they all had Hermes , and if you went into the ladies ' room after they 'd been in there , the whole place would be a frightful mess , since they just as sumed the servants would be coming round to clean out the stalls . " We rolled around the Corniche , the Champs-Elysees of Cairo , a broad avenue overlooking the Nile , and Melissa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 'd easily find nu merous Cairenes in the shadows under the bridges , furtively , busily masturbating . Whether this is from lack of privacy at home or some erotic pleasure at impregnating the Nile , we did n't know , and could n't figure out a polite way of asking . Instead , we went on a tour of the Khedive 's private palace , with a guide whose only professional ability was to wave at the room while saying nothing , like a surly , unattractive Vanna White . He tried rubbing his crotch up against me , and then against Melissa , to improve his tip , but this was n't a successful strategy and as we left , he cursed us with shaking fists , screaming in that extra-special " enraged Muslim " style . Certain Third World vacations come with a secret , sur prise bonus : a culture clash of sonic-boom proportions . You the traveler are there to relax , enjoy , forget your troubles c'm on get happy ? while the locals surrounding you are in hot pursuit of what may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put yourself in their shoes , imagine you 're eking out a bare subsistence and only a few bucks away from eviction when there 's a knock at your trailer-park door . You // open it : Bill Gates has dropped by . What would you do ? Since the stakes for Emerging Marketers bumping into a rich foreign tourist are so high , they commonly move in too close , too loud , too fast , and no matter what the intentions , you ca n't help but feel threatened , and under siege . Soon enough , we 'd found ourselves under siege in Cairo . Apparently , plenty of Egyptians who work with tourists have found that throwing temper tantrums and screaming bloody murder can dramatically raise their tips , and they 'd try this trick on us twenty-four hours a day . They made us feel like walking ATM machines or tender , succulent chickens surrounded by starving coyotes . They 'd size us up with piercing eyes , as well as think that we , as Unbelievers of the holy laws of Islam , were spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when asked where we were from , to say " Russia . " Everyone in Egypt knows that Russians are broke . Throughout the Middle East , five times a day , we heard one thing . The ancient Moors loved a mournful , minor-key cascade of wailing that in Spain became the soap opera of flamenco and in Islam , the call to prayers of the muezzin . We 'd be lying in our luxuriously appointed hotel rooms , or traveling in a taxi seeing skyscrapers , neon and billboards for Sony camcorders and Macintosh computers , when all of a sudden there 'd be that cry of Islamic devotion , a sound from the dawn of time . The same minor key can be heard across all of the Middle East , as , for almost a century , the radio waves have been dominated by one person , Um Kulthum , known by millions as " Souma . " On the first Thursday of every month , she appears on a Cairene stage to sing two songs , each of which lasts for two hours , wailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the street , and heard men scream82 CRAIG NELSON ing to her , " Souma , Souma , my sweetheart , my love ! " she 'd just turned ninety . The Muslim women robed in black that I 'd pass in public knew that I knew that they 're married and unavailable , and this relieved them of the need to act modest . They 'd flirt and goof off and have fun with me in a way that a single , unveiled woman could n't , even when they had five-gallon metal cans of water swaying on their heads . Besides the traditional Islamic robes , many Cairenes wore military outfits ? boots , camouflage pants , flak jackets ? and just as I was thinking this was a fad and started looking for Army-Navy surplus stores , I realized that these were hand-me-downs from the 1960s Levant ? not exactly a groovy era of peace and love in this part of the world . The Attic of Broken Noses We took a walk through the Cairo Museum , and this stroll is exactly like a dream , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leaves you everything . Instead of the careful layout , lighting and captions that are the goal of most museums , here is chaos , darkness and some of the greatest pieces of art ever made buried in piles of crap , lit by grimy skylights , and kept behind glass so filthy they can barely be seen . " I always tell people who 're coming here to bring a flashlight , a roll of paper towels and a bottle of Windex , " Melissa commented as we meandered through this claustrophobe 's attic nightmare . Even so , this museum , like the rest of Egypt , is so bursting with wonders that it makes the other great museum Egyptian wings , from the British to the Met , look like garage sales . Step by step , we stood in // awe of an endless parade of furniture , jewelry , carvings and coffins , clear evidence that Kemet was one of the richest nations in history . Plenty of the museum statues have their noses broken , which is no accident , since it was believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a spirit that entered through the nostrils , and breaking the nose would supernaturally kill it . If you have a really good guide ( which you wo n't ) , he 'll remember to tell you this , but invariably he wo n't bother explaining the corollary , a crucial idea to remember while traveling through this alien culture . For the ancient Egyptians , paintings and sculpture ( and makeup ) were alive , and in fact they had one word to mean painter , artist or sculptor : " He who keeps alive . " Besides evading five thousand years of professional graverobbing , Egyptian antiquities also had to avoid the various Cairo governments which , when the state coffers drooped , felt quite comfortable selling their heritage , as well as marauding Europeans , who took home souvenirs of anything their Egyptian porters could carry . Because of all these vanished antiquities , historians are constantly trying to work around a giant black hole of missing information , and at the core of Egyptology lies a series of profound mysteries . In the Cairo Museum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their legs tied together , being force-fed chunks of meat , much as the French force-feed geese for foie gras .. . but no one has any idea why they 're doing this . Everywhere we went in the country , we saw countless illustrations of pharaohs wearing the double crown symbolizing the unity of Upper and Lower Egypt . . . but nobody has ever found one of these crowns . Egyptologists do n't even know , exactly , what the Kemetians looked like . The Cairo Museum is chock-full of statues and friezes with Egyptian females painted ashwhite , males crayon-red , while Nubians and other Africans // are black as soot . There 's plenty of Egyptian artwork , however , with features that are obviously African ( such as the funeral mask of King Tut ) , and to top it all off , there 's one sculpture that looks exactly like Elizabeth Taylor from Cleopatra . There is so much missing from Egyptology that it actually takes on a magical quality . On the first floor of the museum , there are two carved stone signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to commemorate important events . Both of these were made at the same time , around 3000 B.G.E. One has friezes of donkeys , oxen and olive trees , and could have been carved during the start of any Middle Eastern culture . The other , however , is perhaps the most important piece of Egyptian art ever found : " The Narmer Palette , " named for the pharaoh who first unified the country . Every single element we identify with ancient Egypt is right there ? hieroglyphs , cartouches , the bulbous white crown of Upper Egypt , the towering red crown of Lower Egypt , and even a big display of smoting . ( Remember how the Bible is always saying " Hepsebub thus did smote down the Ephysiates , and Jereboabum did smote down the Hodarites , and Rhubarb did smote down the Zobarites , he smote down every one " ? All over Egypt there are illustrations of pharaohs grabbing their much smaller enemies by the hair , and bludgeoning them . ) No archaeologists have uncovered any previous evidence of any of the elements that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing that shows the evolution of hieroglyphs , astronomy , medicine or the ancient Egyptian religion . They all just suddenly appear , fully formed , on this one stone , as if out of nowhere , as if dropped from the heavens . // An Afternoon with the Father of Terror If Neil Armstrong had landed on the moon and discovered three forty-story-high , geometrically perfect orbs , each built with immense , multi-ton , perfectly carved cubes , would n't it be the shock of the world ? This is exactly how I felt seeing the Giza pyramids in person for the first time . They are the tallest thing built by human beings until the nineteenth century brought us the tres chic Eiffel Tower , and if I turned away from the slum next door and the madding hordes of pyramidiots , frantic camel guides , bibelot merchants and fat tourists exploding out of their neon-colored Lycra stretch pants , I could easily imagine when originally there was no Cairo here ; only a city of the dead in the middle of the Great Sand Sea . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Muslims to build their palaces , even surrounded by camel-ride concessions and postcard-vending tents and horse-renting pseudo-Bedouins ( every visitor here is forced to ride a camel or a horse or a donkey or some damn thing ) , the Giza pyramids knocked me out : forty stories of pure unbelievably mathematical razor-sharp perfection . The idea was for the awesome power and majesty of imperial Kemet to make you feel little and puny and insignificant , and boy did I ever , especially after climbing around inside the Great Pyramid through tunnels angled at ninety degrees , in stifling heat , surrounded by zaftig German newlyweds . How many pyramid theories have you heard ? Are they astronomical observatories , architectural almanacs , scale models of the Northern Hemisphere , energy lenses , power mirrors , weather forecasters , baptismal fonts , astronaut // launch pads , temples or tombs ? All these and more have been theorized , but we still do n't know for sure . The tombs of Kemet are covered with painted scenes of daily life , exquisite details of how those living five thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wove , prayed , tanned leather , smithed gold and smote the neighbors . But there are no pictures or texts describing the erection of pyramids , temples , tombs or any other kind of edifice ? a quite deliberate silence . Standing in front of them all and carved out of living rock is the magnificent creation that the Arabs call Abu al-Hawl , " The Father of Terror . " We know that Egyptians saw sphinxes as the guardians of sacred locations ? supernatural watchdogs with the smarts of a human and the strength of a lion . Originally the Great Sphinx had been painted to look half human and half carnivore , with the headdress rendered in livid blue and yellow stripes , and if you believed that statues have something of a life of their own , it must 've been a truly frightful thing . Gustave Flaubert thought the face looked African , and especially seeing it in profile , I had to agree . Just next door is Saqqarah , a mortuary complex even older than Giza , whose buildings contain the first writings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Book of the Dead . These are the line drawings , hieroglyphs and epic comic books drawn inside every Egyptian tomb , covering the walls , the ceilings and the coffins . Much of it can be basically explained by two ideas : " You can take it with you " and " Just in case you forget what to do in the Underworld , we 're going to draw the instructions all over your grave . " Other than those two basic concepts , however , we do n't really know much about what any of this means . One pyramid text , The Book of What Is in the Duat , appears all over Egypt and is a great example . For starters , EgyptoloLET 'S // gists ca n't agree on what , exactly , the Duat is . All measurements in the Book are given in schoeni ( no one has yet discovered what a schoeni is ) , and central chapters are written in a language never seen elsewhere , and which has never been fully translated . The story 's key plot concerns the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun after it sets on this world and enters the next , accompanied by various gods , demons and creatures we do n't know anything about : a pair of knife-wielding serpents , a duo of fire-spitting cobras , a baboon carrying an ibis , and snakes named " He Who Swallows the Forms " and " The One Whose Mouth Is Wiped . " Another Saqqarah highlight is a tomb for the two men who were King Niusere 's " Overseers of the Manicurists " ? concrete evidence of just how seriously these people took their cosmetics . We do n't know if these overseers were brothers , close friends , lovers or whatever , but in their offering chapel , where the surviving family would go to pray and make obeisances in order to get the dead to do good things for them ( or at least not do bad things against them ) , the two men are depicted , as they will be remembered for all eternity , in the manner that Egyptians used to show the greatest possible closeness between two people : Their noses touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they may be tied together . Would you like it if your grave became a hugely popular tourist attraction , and tens of thousands of people every year came to peer inside your carefully maintained sarcophagus ( a word I like , since it 's Greek for " flesh-eating box " ) ? I know I would . // The Disneyland of the Dead Melissa was keen to go north to the Mediterranean coast where she had never been , and this turned out to be hours of dull train travel through the rice fields of the Nile Delta to get to a North African port town with little to distinguish it from hundreds of others . When its library with a million volumes burned to the ground , it was n't rebuilt by its Koranonly Muslim rulers , who also did nothing when the harbor lighthouse , one of the Seven Wonders of the World , crumbled and fell into the sea . Alexandria , though , still has something remarkable : the catacombs of Kom el-Shugafa , a concrete example of the collapse of empire . A wealthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a burial plot just like the great Egyptian tombs of yore , so they dug a spiral staircase into the ground , with catacombs and visitors ' chambers hewn into the rock at multiple levels , and then had all of it decorated with a cartoon version of Egyptian religious art . We climbed , deeper and deeper , into this clammy , fetid hole , which was unbelievably ugly and creepy , completely depressing , and perfect for Vegas . Egyptian scholar John Anthony West was so taken aback by this site that he remarked : " Egypt , which began with the superhuman Sphinx , the prodigious pyramids , and the pristine geometry of Saqqarah , which survived internal anarchy and foreign domination to produce Dir el-Bahari , the Hypostyle Hall of Karnak and the lesser but still resonating temples of Edfu , Dendera , and Philae , finished here , in Alexandria , in an underground Disneyland . " Melissa pronounced it a " must-miss . " We got back to Cairo to find out that our palace no longer had rooms available until we ourselves threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one bed came free . With my sonic-boom snoring , Melissa had to go off and sleep in the tub . The next day , we were told by the travel agent that our train to Aswan left from the downtown station , so we went to visit one of Melissa 's friends , Vicki , who lived in a spectacular Heliopolis apartment nearby . She offered us the universal beverage of welcome ( Diet Coke ) while her blond kids ( the husband 's French ) played Star Wars with plastic lasers . The apartment was lavish and immaculate , featuring an antique pipe organ , two washing machines , two deep freezes and twenty-four bottles of Chivas arrayed on silver trays , while the public hallways and vestibules ( like in many other Egyptian luxury buildings ) looked like utter slums . Hostess Vicki was almost a perfect stereotype of the New York mother . She kept emerging from the kitchen with bigger and bigger trays of pastry and candy , urging us on with , " Just have one more . Just one ! " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop was Aswan , and Vicki casually replied that she was quite sure the Aswan train left not from downtown but from Giza , quite far from her flat . After some hysteric phoning we discovered that this was indeed true , but luckily one of Vicki 's neighbors was a professional taxi driver , and he agreed to speed us over . We arrived just as the train was pulling in ( late , thank God ) and paid him extremely well , at which point he started ranting about what cheap bastards we were and cursed us with shaking fists in that " enraged Muslim " style we 'd already come to know so well . The main Egyptian railroad is a spectacular ride , as it coasts from Giza to Aswan along the border of irrigation . We looked out one side of the train to see lush tropical farmland rolling by , one giant oasis , green as Florida , while the other side is an absolute , remote , lifeless desert . On the irrigated // side are towns and boats and every kind of farmland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but sand dunes and mud domes ? like wasps ' nests ? for the dead . The train slowly rolled along all evening , and it rolled along all night , and it rolled along all morning . We were supposed to hit Aswan at ten A.M. , which would allow plenty of time to check into the hotel and get me to the airport for a one-thirty flight to Nubia , but that big old train kept arollin ' . Ten-thirty passed , and then eleven , and then twelve , and then twelve-ten , twelve-twenty , twelve-thirty . . . and the train would n't arrive , and of course I was having a heart attack . Finally we stopped and jumped out and grabbed the first cab that came along . Just outside the airport , the car " broke down " ( later I realized that the cabdriver probably did n't have an entry permit ) , so I had to run to the terminal in one hundred degrees of heat , kicking up dust , and got in at one , relieved , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already taken off . The ticket agent told me the next plane was sold out in coach so I 'd have to buy a wildly expensive first-class upgrade . I explained that since the Egyptian state tourist agency had set up the trip , and the Egyptian state train was four hours late , and the Egyptian state airline had overbooked , it was n't me who was going to pay for this upgrade . After much suspenseful waiting , the man gave me a coach ticket and I got on the three-thirty plane . . . to find it two-thirds empty . We arrived an hour before sunset , which turned out , after all that trauma , to be absolutely the perfect moment to see one of the greatest treasures of the ancient world . // The Ultimate Smote Abu Simbel is sited in the lands that were once Nubia and , before that , the Kingdom of Kush , which today 's nomads call the Sea of Satan . These were the Mexicos of the ancient world , each with a wonderful culture all its own , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbor . You 'd think the ancient Egyptians would 've felt warmly toward their Southland , since Nubia was the source of nub ? gold ? which they considered the flesh of the gods . . . but there was no good-neighbor policy . Tutankhamen , for one , had pictures of Kushites painted on the bottoms of his shoes so he could perpetually smite and trample them . The lands of Kush and Nubia are now drowned to oblivion by the Aswan Dam , the ultimate smote . Today , all that 's left of these once-mighty kingdoms are the placid sky-blue waters of Lake Nasser , lapping against the yellow desert sands . At dusk , the shoreline is a bronze canyonland , and tucked into what would be an utterly unnoticeable little alcove is the astonishing Abu Simbel , built to show those low-life Kushites and Nubians just who 's boss around these parts . Abu 's entry is four stone colossi , sixty-five-foot-high statues of Ramses the Great , with his wives and kids cavorting between his legs . . . while above their heads is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entry hall is supported by pillars of Ramses , fifteen feet tall , wearing heavy eyeliner , while the inscribed and painted walls celebrate his military victories ( which involve a great deal of smoting ) and the ceiling is patterned in china-blue imperial vultures , spreading their wings in benevolent protection . It is completely staggering , but there 's more : Twice a year , on February 23 and October 23 , the rising sun sends a shaft of light // straight back through the halls to the final sanctuary , where it illuminates a pantheon of the lords of creation , each of which has been completely mutilated . By whom ? We do n't know . Their faces now look melted , vaguely human , like indistinct ghosts of the subconscious , waiting there , in moist darkness , for their two days of light . Almost every guide in Egypt is from hell . They 've learned a basic patter to repeat over and over as quickly as possible , throwing out one piece of information after another in a barely intelligible monotone , with whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Besides their demeanor , much of what they tell you is wrong ( or at least old and discredited ) . Some of the guides were so astonishingly terrible that I could n't help but think : How did the people who made the flabbergasting thing I was looking at devolve into this person talking about it ? So when I got back to Aswan and we ultimately found a magnificent guide , almost entirely by accident , it was a shock . Ahmad was an educated man , a schoolteacher , who knew plenty of off-the-beaten-tracks , including a late temple that we wandered through completely on our own . Afterward , we trudged across a hill above the city , behind the Aga Khan 's tomb , to see a Copt monastery with beautiful frescoes at the edge of a thousand miles of Sahara desert . We walked around to the back ? only to find an immense field of shattered pottery and human feces ( the kitty litter box of the gods ) ? scurried back to the nonfeces part , and started ambling out into the sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper and deeper into the earth with every step , and soon enough , we got scared ... the vista of that Big Empty , the ominous sound of the winds , the shadows of the dunes , rising and falling against the sands , huge and black , and the feeling in our shoes that , at any moment , we could be swallowed up whole . . . well , we saw right away why the // ancients thought the desert was a frightening , awful place . In just a few minutes , we 'd left civilization and entered the wilderness , and we now turned to go back as quickly as we could . The Empire of Sid Caesar Besides Abu Simbel , Ramses the Great marked his Greatness with monumental constructions throughout the New Kingdom capital of Luxor , where every one of the pharaoh 's statues is graced with a Mona Lisa smile . It 's no wonder : Ramses was rich as hell , lived into his eighties , reigned for six decades over the greatest empire of his time , and had ninety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is anyone 's guess ) . He did n't , however , look much like Yul Brynner in The Ten Commandments , since he had red hair , a big jaw , a beaky nose and a long , thin face . In fact , Ramses looked quite a bit like Sid Caesar , and we know from his mummy that he also had arthritis , gum disease and beautiful fingernails . While Giza is a barren yellow Sahara , the Valley of the Kings , on the other side of the Nile from Luxor , is the white side of the moon , a blinding , limestone desert oven . The minute we started walking around over there , a real Lawrence of Arabia ? type Arab , in flowing robes , headgear , the whole bit , came up to me with a little sculpture in his hands , whispering , " An-teek ! An-teek ! " It was the head of a woman , nicely done , and of course made that morning , but I liked it , so we had the conversation that African nomads have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much , he said a price , I said one fourth of that , he said three CRAIG NELSON fourths , I said one half , and the sale was made ; about twelve bucks . He took off and I walked away , convinced I 'd find the exact same thing anywhere else for three bucks . . . but in all of Egypt , I never found anything as well made , and never saw that merchant again . I got back to the hotel and washed off the little head 's dirt , and it was even more beautiful , charming and mysterious . Just where was this black-market curio shoppe making such terrific stuff ? If Brenda had been with us , she 'd have found it . Off and away from everything else in this necropolis of secret caves stands probably my all-time favorite Kemet building , " The Most Splendid of All , " Deir el-Bahari , tomb of one of the most remarkable figures of ancient history , Hatshepsut ( hot shep soot ) , and the site where , in 1997 , Islamic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design , Deir makes the Lincoln Memorial look gussied up . It 's a broad and low-slung marble rectangle set against a sheer cliff , faceted with columns that rhythmically follow its background 's rocky orthogonal patterns , so perfectly integrated into its surroundings that it looks as if the earth itself disgorged it . . . not unlike the ancient Egyptians ' primordial swamp spitting up all of life and creation . Looking at it , I forced myself to remember that what is now beautifully minimalist was at one time maximalist to the extreme . The clean white desert highway we walked to the tomb was originally landscaped with pools , orchards , flower beds and rows of brightly painted sphinx guardians . Every statue and every frieze was coated in the extreme colors that can be seen in bits and pieces all over Egypt , and there would 've been dozens of waving flags , banners and curtains . So much of modern design has been influenced by ruins , but do n't be fooled . The ancient empires , whether Chinese , Egyptian or Mesoamerican , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big gooey paint job even more . Hatshepsut was both the daughter and the wife of a pharaoh , and when her husband died , the heir was a twelveyear-old boy who sought the bright lights of military conquest instead of the ruling life in Thebes . He took off for the territories , while she declared herself co-regent and ceremonially , like all pharaohs , appeared publicly in full beard . Some of her portraits show her as a man , others show her as a woman dressed up like a man , and still others show her as a young boy . E.T. , eat your heart out . The Dawn of a New Religion Just a ways down the river is the temple to Osiris at Abydos , enough off the beaten track so that most tourists skip it , which makes as much sense as skipping the pyramids . Abydos is the only temple which has held on to vast amounts of its original paint job , and it makes all the other ruins look ruined . . . dead . . . while it looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in fact , still use it to worship Kemet 's greatest god , and it 's as close as you can get to seeing what ancient Egyptian art really looked like . Here , the men are red , the women are yellow , and the gods are sky blue ( or not painted at all ? invisible ) , while the ceilings are alive with butter-yellow stars and blood-red vultures . My favorite picture in all Abydos shows Osiris receiving the ankh ( the power of life ) from the ibis-headed Thoth , while wearing an **30;2083;TOOLONG crown , topped with a blinding sun disk . Wrapped around the horns are cobras decked out in plumed hats and miniature sun-balls , waving in a pro96 CRAIG NELSON tective breeze . Compared to this , those Close Encounters aliens are a real snooze . Every little hieroglyph and painting in Abydos , every piece of furniture , item of jewelry , headdress feather , striped linen pleat and shepherd 's crook is so deeply sculpted , with such craft and such artistry , and then painted in such rich , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within just a few minutes I went eye-blind and brain-numb . The walls tell the story of Egypt 's all-time most popular god , Osiris , who was father of civilization , teaching the Egyptians farming , law and religion . Osiris went off to teach the rest of the world , leaving his homeland in the capable rule of his wife , Isis ( who was also his sister ) . When he got back home , his evil brother Typhon tricked him into getting into a box , which he nailed shut and covered with lead and threw into the Nile , in order to marry Isis and take over the throne . After many adventures , the box was recovered . Isis turned herself into a hawk , flapped her wings , resurrected her brother/husband hack to life , and while doing so had a son , born of the virgin womb , who turned out to be the falcon-head god , Horus . Typhon , enraged , hacked Osiris 's body into fourteen pieces and scattered them throughout Egypt , throwing the penis into the Nile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard it was a catfish and refused , from then on , to eat catfish ) . Isis found all the body parts ( except the penis ) and reassembled her husband . With instructions from the gods , she preserved him for all time by creating the first mummy , and brought him back to life once again . Osiris , however , decided to rule not in Egypt but in the Under-world , and left his kingdom to his son Horus , who battled his uncle again and again , until finally becoming the indis putable leader of all Kemet . The ancient Egyptians worshipped Osiris , Isis and Horus as a holy family , and they thought of Osiris as being just like // a good shepherd , taking care of all his followers ( in Egyptian art , he 's always depicted with a crook and flail ) . When the dead travel to the Underworld , they are judged by having their heart ( a jar ) weighed against the laws of the universe ( an ostrich feather ) , and those with good hearts get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead , while the bad-hearted get eaten by a crocodile-snouted , lion-maned , hippo-assed woman . The details may be different ( especially the penis-eating catfish ) , but there 's a lot that Kemetians and Christians have in common . The roles of Isis and Mary are almost identical , and there are many parallel rules of living a moral life , even to the point where an Old Kingdom collection of sages ' wisdom is almost word for word the same as the Book of Proverbs . The key underlying beliefs are almost a perfect match , since both Christians and Kemetians believe that mortal humans have within them the spark of the divine and , if nurtured , they can become immortal . That , if you follow the rules and act the right way , you 'll have eternal life . In its final days , the culture of ancient Egypt did n't wither away from the vast corruption of the Ptolemies or the military conquest of the Romans , but from the fevered Christian Emperor Justinian , who demanded the closing of the temples and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's believed by many that Egyptians took to Christianity so strongly and so quickly because the two religions have so much in common . You can see the final stand of the Kemet priests at Philae . . . the " underground Disneyland " of the culture 's collapse at Alexandria . . . and here , at Abydos , which most tourists skip , you can see a wholly alien culture outlining the key Christian philosophies . . . and a paint job that 'll knock your socks off . // The White Side of the Moon Everywhere I went , I was staggered by the artistry of Kemet , the carving and painting and bas-reliefs and friezes , which are all beautiful beyond imagining . Even the walls and walls of hieroglyphs ... wonderfully etched flying wasps , and fertile cow-girls , and gasping crocodiles , and " what me worry ? " faces , and plump honeybees , and alert hares , and flying beetles , and blooming lotus . . . are all perfectly carved into solid granite , and can be enjoyed for hours . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside . . . it is too strange , too bizarre , too alien . To get a stirring of the soul , I had to travel to one more spot , to Egypt 's back-of-beyond . That this place is named for Sin , the Mesopotamian god of the moon , is just right , since the land is a naked moonscape where nothing grows but pathetic , desiccated scrub . The prophet Elijah came here to hide from King Ahab and Queen Jezebel , the Holy Family came here to hide from King Herod , and the Israelites were stuck wandering for forty years after making false idols , which shows exactly how nasty the God of the Old Testament really was . The Sinai is so desolate , so rocky , so empty and so hostile that it just seems to continually whisper : Do n't even think of living here .. . Besides being the spot where God gave Moses the Ten Commandments and where Muhammad 's horse , Boraq , ascended to heaven , Mount Sinai is also supposed to be the hiding place for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egypt . Between spirit and mammon , the Mount has been a singular attraction for everyone from self-styled Indiana Jones wannabes to Christian and Muslim fundamentalist maniacs , and today there 's plenty of both who believe that the mount in Sinai is not the biblical // Mount Sinai at all , that the real deal 's around the corner , in Saudi Arabia . Believe it or not , deep down where it counts , it does n't matter . Even an atheist can not visit the Sinai 's Mount without feeling a movement in the body , a stirring in the soul . Since I 'd agreed to go to Alexandria with her , I forced Melissa to come to Sinai with me , and she was completely prepared to hate it . Instead , she wandered across the rocks , silent , pensive , watching . Instead of soil , or grassland , or even sand dunes ? anything soft and welcoming ? the peninsula is acre after acre of gravel , boulders , clay and wind-worn buttes , the only visible life a short-cropped , brutish weed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cemeteries are merely a collection of nicely placed rocks serving as cremation markers , and the only people even trying to live here are Bedouins . Everywhere in the Third World are people who want absolutely nothing to do with the twentieth century ? people deliberately living on the other side of nowhere . The Bushmen of the Kalahari , the Dani of the New Guinea Highlands , and the Bedouins of the North Sahara are all far too wrapped in their own culture to have any interest in ours , and that 's probably why they 're the most interesting people I 've ever met overseas . Most Sinai Bedouins today have given up the camel for the jeep and the tent for a stone house , but that 's all they want from technology and progress . Big parties , for example , are still celebrated with that highlight of Bedouin cuisine , pots and pots of boiled goat . On our visit to Mt . Sinai 's 1,300-year-old monastery , St. Catherine 's , the monks showed us their burning bush , their well of Moses , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other Old Testament miracles , none of which seemed remotely plausible . How could they be so certain that it was this bush , this well and that rock ? Still , there is // something here that defies explanation or description . The rush of the wind . . . the mountains ' harsh , rocky peaks .. . the clear air that lets you see for hundreds of miles and makes you want to just start walking off into the ether . . . You 've found something , though what it is , exactly , you do n't know . But there is something here in the middle of nowhere that you can feel in your bones . . . something real , yet intangible . . . something out there . That this is one of the world 's true holy places is , to anyone who comes out and sees it in person , unmistakable . Into the Liver of Borneo The Ritual Harvesting of a Strange , Multihued Sea ; ; orm .1 . year after getting back from Kemet , I left a job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little company just starting up , and it was immediately obvious I 'd now be working night and day , nose to the grindstone , fingers to the bone . There were four weeks ' downtime in between and at the very last minute , I realized : You wo n't be seeing another vacation moment for a very long time . I wanted to really go , again , to the back-of-beyond ; to a place where day-to-day American life was as foreign as it could be , and I spun the globe to what would be exactly the opposite side of the world from my home in New York City . There it was : the Malay // Archipelago ... the East Indies . . . the band of Spice Islands that runs along the Java Sea . A collection of 13,700 utterly distinct atolls masquerading as one sovereign nation , Indonesia is tres cool , featuring dancing girls in Java , orangutans in Borneo , renegade civil disorder in Timor , dragons in Komodo , Muslim fanatics in Lombok , sacred water buffalo in Sulawesi , holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strange , multihued seaworm " in Sumba , and cannibals in New Guinea . The cat 's meow . I looked at all this and could only remember the phrase Brenda uses as her shopping mantra : " I 'll take them all . " Basically , I wanted to hop from island to island , seeing as much as possible in four weeks , and I wanted to set sail in three days . I booked an appointment to get the necessary chloroquine ( a malarial prophylaxis ) and started researching to find the very best Indonesian travel agency who could set up the basics ASAP . Vayatour in California seemed the most qualified , which was confirmed when they pulled together a remarkably complicated trip in two days ' time . The schedule we finally worked out included three days in the ancient Javan capital of Jogjakarta , five days with the proboscis monkeys and orangutans in Borneo , five in luxurious , **27;2115;TOOLONG Bali , and five in New Guinea with a tribe of ( hopefully ) ex-cannibals . To show just what an achievement this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Central Java to the Borneo orangutan preserve involved a car ride from Jogjakarta to Semarang , a flight to Surabaya , another flight to Pangkalan Bun , a car to Kumai , a boat to the Rimba Lodge , and another boat to Camp Leakey . The New York ? Frankfurt ? Singapore ? Jakarta run was with Singapore Air , which turned out to be just terrific , especially the beautiful and fascistic Malay stewardesses who 'd poke // me in the shoulder and hiss , " Wake up ! It 's time to eat ! " Like any international flight today , SingAir showed us various bits of data from the cockpit , my all-time favorite being The Time Screen , which tells you what time it is where you are , what time it is where you were , what time it is where you 'll be , what time it was when you left , and what time it 'll be when you arrive , all accompanied by a constantly shifting series of cartoon planes soaring over ever-zooming maps and charts . The Time Screen serves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs , are quite literally up in the air , and instead of feeling informed , the more I looked at it , the more baffled I got . The only way I can survive a flight like this is to sleep through most of it , and it took me decades to learn how to nod off against a backdrop of fussy babies , bouncing wind currents , squirming teens and Chevy Chase feature presentations . As a sleeping aid , I always remember that , aloft , I 'm rendered completely irresponsible and out of control . . . unreachable . . . in transit . . . neither here , nor there . And I take along a U-pillow and a good supply of sleeping pills , just in case . When awake , I 'd leaf through a pile of guidebooks , and could only think of how much I would n't get to see . I 'd be missing out on those giant , goat-eating dragon lizards of Komodo , whose tails are lethal weapons and whose saliva is highly toxic . I would n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New Guinea swamps , who ate Michael Rockefeller . I would n't get to see the Borneo Dayak , entire tribes living in one giant jungle longhouse , whose pierced earlobes , weighed down with enormous gold and brass rings , extend beneath the shoulders . I 'd miss the southern Java coast , where enormous sea turtles lay their oily , leathery eggs on black sand beaches at midnight , while locals serve magic mushroom omelets to gaping tourists . I // would n't get to experience the " traditional massage by blind men " of Sulawesi , or see that island 's Toraja , who create massive roofs on their houses to imitate the ship from another planet that brought their people to earth , whose children keep bees tied on strings as pets , and who worship the water buffalo . ( When I hit Sulawesi on a layover , I could n't figure out why I was so popular with the locals , until one morning , I looked in the mirror on the way out the door and realized I 'd spent the whole trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like their sacred cow . ) This whole vacation , I soon decided , would be a terrible disappointment of lost opportunity . While I read the chronicles of Magellan 's own Spice voyage ( as transcribed by his secretary , Pigafetta ) , we finally touched down in Jogjakarta , center of the ancient Java Empire . I drove around , watching silk-robed and coolie-hatted peasants laboring in emerald-green rice fields , backed by sandalwood groves and volcanoes shrouded in their own blue mists . These extraordinary shots popped up again and again , and I could only think that Java is one of the few islands left that still lives up to our South Seas dreams . Since it 's got 121 volcanoes ( plenty of which are active ) , I saw smoldering cones everywhere , beautiful and deadly , like a Hollywood special effect about to happen , and could only think : They are n't dormant enough . The right-wing military coup that came to power in 1965 's " Year of Living Dangerously " is still around , coining such political slogans as " Development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of nepotism , there 's not so much development outside the onetime ruling Suharto family , who 've all become billionaires . Even though Indonesia is the fifth largest oil producer , the government became so entangled in monopoly schemes that it financially collapsed in 1997 ( a collapse even worse than America 's Great DepresLET 'S // sion ) , and the International Monetary fund refused to help unless then President Suharto and his family changed their kickback-loving ways , and left office . One of the things that keeps emerging markets from emerging is when the rulers and their cronies take over vast portions of the economy , stifling competition and scaring off foreign investment , and that 's exactly what happened here . The youngest Suharto son , Tommy Putra , owns Indonesia 's airline and a monopoly on clove production ( the vast majority of Indonesians smoke kretek clove cigarettes ) , while one of his brothers owns the state 's communications industry , and a sister has most of the country 's toll roads . Other children own the television and radio networks , petroleum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bali 's major resorts , while Suharto 's ex-wife , Tien , was so known for getting her cut of the action that she 's commonly referred to as " Madame Tien-Percent . " As a Westerner traveling solo , I was constantly running into Indonesian families armed with giant baskets of snacks , samples of which they were quite keen for me to eat . The mama would hand over a mysterious food item , and then the entire clan would gather round to watch me enjoy it . Since for travelers , home cooking in emerging markets is a guaranteed one-way ticket to explosive diarrhea , there I was , looking at this thing , trying to figure out whether or not it 's safe and , if not , how do I get out of having to swallow ? Everyone 's watching you , Carrie . At one point , I was given something that looked like a tamale , and it seemed well cooked , so I chawed down , only to have the family become hysterical ; I was n't supposed to eat the outer leaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like substance , filled with a very spicy , sugary center made out of nuts . . . the culinary version of Chinese nesting dolls . Frankly , I preferred the wrapper. // My favorite food as a kid was , by far , peanut butter , and here in Indonesia it is served , heated and spiced , as a barbecue dipping sauce . I ordered it everywhere , dipping and slurping and reverting to sloppy boyhood . It was certainly more soothing than the other favorite Indonesian dipping sauce , trasi ... fermented shrimp paste . All this strange food reminded me of how , today , you can go to a restaurant in Houston and eat barbecued chicken , or you can go to a restaurant in Paris and have chicken Provencale , or you can eat in a hotel bar in Jakarta and have chicken with spicy peanut sauce , and if you make a heroic effort , you can eat local , original cuisine , like the gizzardpaste sandwich that all Britons adore . But how different is any of this ( except for the gizzard-paste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat at a restaurant in your own city ? If you really travel to the back-of-beyond , however , meals can be filled with mystery and surprise . In the middle of nowhere , dinner will be served , and your host will tell you , " It 's chicken ! " but you know for certain that this ca n't be , since you have n't seen a chicken for days and days . So you keep asking what it is , and they just keep saying , " It 's chicken ! " and you keep chewing , trying to figure it out ( iguana ? tree kangaroo ? sloth ? ) , but it tastes okay , so you just keep eating .. . Everywhere in the East Indies I was asked : Are you married ? Where is your wife ? How many children ? Since everyone in Indonesia over the age of fifteen is married , I was considered a circus freak when I said no , and trying to explain being a middle-aged single person quickly became onerous . The enormous temptation was just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once I 'd start down that slope , where would I brake ? Soon enough , my first two wives would be killed in a hurricane , and now I lived with spouse number // three , eight children and seventeen grandchildren , on a mountaintop in Iowa . Besides the details of my wife and kids , no one in Indonesia wanted to know anything about life in the U.S. After all , they 've seen Rambo and Animal House on video . What they wanted to know is , where else had I been in the East Indies , and how many reasons could I think of why their island is the best of them all ? Soon enough , I was learning how to say things like " New Guinea is so much nicer than Bali , since you do n't have all those noisy , dirty buses and airplanes , " and sounding completely sincere while doing it . Outside of these questions , the Indonesians did n't seem to want to have much to do with me , or with any other traveler for that matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the longer I was in the country , the lonelier I felt . Like most developing nations , the local Java homeowners have very original ideas when it comes to decorating , and I quickly started thinking that houses with traffic-sign-yellow walls , peacock-green windows , harlot-red doors and neonblue roofs were completely humdrum . The center of Jogjakarta is a copyright-free zone where the original , more ratlike Mickey Mouse sells an immense variety of products and services , including Ceriping Pedas Bintang Jul Fried Taro Chips . There were bird cages everywhere , since birding , bird-watching , bird-raising and bird-tracking are easily Java 's most popular hobbies . Indonesia has fifteen hundred avian species , and in the squabbling markets , you can buy every single one of them . From the Jogja bird market , I was forced to take the ultimate form of emerging market transportation , thrown into a terror so overwhelming it shook me to my very core . I rode a pedicab . Remember when you were a child , and your big brother made you sit on his bike 's handlebars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , completely un110 CRAIG NELSON protected , thrust forward in this wobbly perch , about to die ? This is the pedicab sensation , except that instead of riding on a quiet suburban driveway , I was in the middle of Third World urban traffic . As the poor , aged pedicab operator ago nizingly rolled my fat butt across town , I was up front and fully exposed to furtive , hungry dogs , thundering oxcarts , ag gressive , motorcycle-riding businesswomen , slow-moving teak snack carts , and herds of desperate animals being driv en to slaughter . . . and so learned the full meaning of " ad-venture travel . " The Sacred Spock Ears Every Indonesian island has its own unique culture , and Java is the pot where they all meet and melt . A local Dutch pastor said , " One hears that Java is 90 percent Moslem , which is a most deceptive truth . For many , religion is a mix ture of animism , Hinduism , Buddhism and Islam , which does not please the Moslem extremists , who are trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you believe in anything whatsoever , it 's convenient to believe it in Java . Many villages in this Islamic nation announce their main thoroughfares with waving Buddhist flags and ban ners , while here and there on the roadside lie carefully ar rayed offerings of fruits and flowers , Hindu memorials to the sites of fatal accidents , with certain highways being so extensively decorated that my first thought was : How pretty ! After seeing dozens and dozens of these offerings , though , I understood that I , too , could end up memorial ized , and those thoughts of How pretty ! changed to We 're all going to die .. . // I had an incredible piece of luck hitting Java in the dry season and during the full moon , since I got to see an extraordinary four-night , sixteen-hour performance of the Ramayana , the original Hindu religious drama , staged against thousand-year-old Hindu towers , the ruins lit by ghostly floodlamps . This epic starred young girls dressed as herds of deer and bunnies , boys dressed as apes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gamelan orchestra on stage , while tiny bats feasted on the insects drawn to the powerful theater lights overhead ? and the obnoxious audience of Austrians and Australians documented every bit of this sacred performance with flashing Instamatics . Besides Bali , Jogja is the Spice Islands ' key destination for culture vultures . Every night , beautiful , trance-inducing gamelan orchestras were gonging and trilling , a set of very big , very orchestrated wind chimes . Even though they 're percussive , gamelans are remarkably soothing , sounding as they do like the haphazard tinkle of the mobiles that hang above every infant 's crib . Jogja has armies of wayangkulit shadow puppet shows that can last up to twelve hours where , like opera , everyone in the audience is assumed to already know the plot and , like opera , if you do n't know it , the show 's about eleven hours and forty-five minutes too long . A host of these performances takes place at the kraton , the sultan 's ancestral home , a palace that beautifully displays the Javan culture melt : Islamic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black chickens , cactus gardens festooned with hollowed-out eggs , dancing dragons , collections of kris ( wavy-bladed daggers ) and lots of intricate paintings of animals with their tongues sticking out . This is still the home of the current Jogja ruler , Sri Sultan Hamengku Buwono IX , who undoubtedly has a great // job since , once a year , there 's a big ceremony where all the local bigwigs have to come and kiss his knees . Every day , the servants still take the carved leather wayang kulit shadow puppets out to air , and talk with them as though they 're alive . Like in many Buddhist countries , Javans believe giant earlobes to be a sign of advanced spirituality . I browsed through the kraton 's various royal photo albums to see slight , regal figures looking just like The King and I but with immense , protuberant Spock ears , and could only guess at what implements of torture were used to achieve this effect . Were they squeezed into some kind of mold , like the bound lilyfeet of China ? Were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Maya ? I could n't get anyone to understand what I was asking , as they seemed to sincerely believe that the royals were all born with such imposing lobes . A Visit with the Wild Man of Borneo A van , two planes and a cab later , I was in the river harbor town of Kumai , Kalimantan Tenagh , Borneo , the heart of Bugi country . Actually , Indonesians do n't say " the heart " of anything , since the heart is n't considered such a big deal . Instead , they say " the liver " ? the liver of Bugi country . From the fourteenth to the nineteenth centuries , the Bugis were the most feared pirates in the world , the de facto rulers of the Java Sea , traveling without sextants or compasses in their giant , seven-sailed , Viking-like prahu across all of Asia , from the Philippines to India . They were so frightening and so // barbarous , in fact , that they 're the source of our word " bogeyman . " The prahu are still there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sulawesi , are now ultraconservative Muslims . It 's a generational saga just like in the West , where if you 're a wealthy Republican pillar of society , your daughter 's bound to turn out to be just like Courtney Love . Is there any place in the world more exotic than Borneo , a land where the birds and the deer bark , where fish can climb trees and catch insects with their spit ? Besides elephant , rhinoceros , clouded leopard , orangutan and legions of extremely odd monkeys , this is also home to two remarkably strange and stinky plants . One is the biggest flower in the world , the rafflesia , a gooey , pink-orange bloom that looks as parasitic as it turns out to be , with an odor that inspired its local name : the corpse flower . The other is durian , or jackfruit , with a taste that 's considerably addicting ( something like homemade custard pie ) , and a smell so vile it 's against Indonesian federal law to eat one on a public bus . The town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entry into Borneo and travel to Tanjung Puting Nature Preserve ( the orangutan sanctuary ) had to be processed by a bureaucracy inherited from Indonesia 's onetime Dutch rulers , something of a cousin to India 's Raj . The hours dragged by , so I wandered out along the dusty main road , seeing the town 's largest building , a whitewashed , tinembossed , onion-domed mosque , as well as the thatchcovered houses stilted over the water , the burnished teak prahu , the aged storekeeper whose smile revealed one remaining tooth , an entire wall decorated in the dripping tongue of the Rolling Stones , and a young girl tending the traditional Borneo mixed flock of black chickens and baby pigs . Kumai was great evidence of the standard Third World // rain forest clearing technique : You burn away everything , and then try to plant what you want instead . Jungle soil is so thin and weak , however , that once the original ecosystem is undone , the only thing that grows is a raw , ugly grassland , like something out of the Oklahoma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants and , for extra-special locations , a dead tree trunk held in place with guide wires and thatched to provide the kind of shade that ca n't be grown anymore . Little by little , word spread through Kumai , and I started noticing growing numbers of people standing furtively in doorways and under awnings , staring at the big white stranger in the sacred water buffalo cap . Suddenly I heard a gruff scream , and turned around to find a young man , just past teendom , shaking his hands at me and yelling . He was n't angry , he was just confronting , being the aggressor , demanding to know something . Of course , I did n't understand a single word he said , but I 'd learned a little Bahasa on that twenty-hour plane ride , and I knew a few things from getting around , namely , that a little bit of humility , politeness , formality and language will take you far . I heard some guffawing , and turned to see a group of kids in the road , coming from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious , frightened and disdainful , all at the same time , not a good omen . The screamer was moving in as well , and it did n't look pretty . I backed a bit off the road , took a bow , held out my hands to everyone watching , and sang ( somewhat in the style of Harry Belafonte 's " Day0 " ) , " Selamat da-a-a-a-y , Kumai ! " This is the very formal way of saying hello in Bahasa Indonesian ; it essentially means " all the best . " Both the screamer and the kids stopped dead in their tracks , and I sang it out again . This time , a goat-herding girl sang it back ; the kids laughed and sang it themselves ; and I did it again . // Now , other watchers joined in , and we sang back and forth . The screamer slunk off , while the kids took my hands and elbows ? four of them to each side ? and dragged me off for a tour . We dropped by the weavers to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefecture with its fake stuffed orangutan ( a sign explained that he was your friend ) , and a small pen containing two award-winning roosters , before making it back to the nature conservation office , where my guide was waiting with all the forms processed and ready to go . A Soft Hoot and the Sound of Smacking Lips The guide turned out to be Harry , twenty-two years old , married with three kids , a Muslim Bugi descendant and , just like every other Bugi I 'd meet , he looked like he 'd been drycleaned . Here we were , inches from the equator , in the middle of one of the world 's deepest jungles , in astonishing heat and humidity , and I never saw a Bugi who sweated , or had a single hair out of place , or had any body odor whatsoever ; they were like Muslim Ozzies and Harriets . This kind of thing is n't so unusual in developing countries , and something worth remembering when deciding if a conversation about politics , religion or sex would be a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get myself in trouble with Harry by joking that one of the orangutans found him attractive . . . and it turned out he did n't get mad that this joke meant he might have sex with an animal ; he was mad because the animal I joked about was a male . As the captain and two boat boys ran the ship , Harry and // I sat on the roof , talking and looking , eating cookies and drinking java ; I was the only passenger . The Sekonyer River was the color of rich black tea , and the shoreline , a heath and peat swamp , was densely packed in low-lying spiny palms , like cactus , completely impenetrable and as hostile-looking as a jungle can get . There was a piercing bark , and I assumed it was some kind of wild dog , but then it struck again , overhead , and Harry and I both looked up at the same time to see a pair of hornbills , big as pterodactyls ( and looking very much like them ) , arching across the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were hurrying straight toward us . The hostile landscape was now giving way to larger and larger groves of big green mangroves , and in the dying light of dusk could be seen small , humanlike shadows scurrying through the branches ? some kind of monkey . And then it was only seconds later that we heard a soft hoot and the sound of smacking lips , turned a bend in the river and saw a blur of rusted cranberry ? a nursing orangutan , languidly watching us with her big black Walter Keane eyes , while hanging upside down from a tree limb and eating a small green banana . The storm never arrived ; we tied up at Rimba Lodge ; I was led to my bungalow ( whose walls were decorated with pictures of the local fauna torn out of magazines ) , unpacked , and went to the restaurant for a drink before dinner , and to meet the other guests . Here and there , the staff would dash off on errands , ferrying laundry , changing a baby , lugging boxes of food and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but saw no one , save other Bugis , who went quietly about their business . I was brought a menu , placed an order , and had a delicious mulligatawny-styled soup followed by grilled prawns with a peanut sauce . Still no other guests . A few bobtailed cats wandered by , and I thought // they might be bred this way ( like Manxes ) , so I asked Harry 's wife , Irina , if they were special cats , and she said , " Yes ! They are very special ! " The cats yowled for my dinner leftovers while , off in the distance , birds called , monkeys hooted , insects buzzed , and a pigeon cried out its lonely , breathless " Ha ! . . . Ha ! . . . Ha ! " Finally , I turned to one of the busy stewards and asked him to tell me who else was staying in the hotel . He told me there was nobody else , that for my entire stay , I 'd be the only guest , and if there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy , he explained , it was because the day after I left , the Rimba would be the site of a major scientific conference with various heads of state attending , and they were all making sure that nothing would go awry . That 's when it hit me why this experience seemed so odd . Everyone was so busy getting ready for the conference and completely ignoring me that it felt like I was some kind of intruder , who 'd wandered by accident into a Bugi village ? a village built in the shape of a giant jungle lodge . This lack of contact makes me feel completely alone and isolated , and I started feeling really , really sorry for myself . I then remembered that part of the reason I loved these kinds of trips was that you went to the middle of nowhere , and were put into situations , and had to figure out how to make do . So I made do . I 'd always wanted to travel into the Heart of Darkness , to be a Stranger in a Strange Land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I paid for ... The next morning I got up before dawn to get away from the scurrying , noisy hotel staff and go canoeing off by myself , floating silently , listening to the jungle on a blackwater river flowing to the Java Sea . There was still quite a fog over the water , and I paddled away upstream , finally cut off from any humans nearby . . . and the noise was deafening . The cicadas were like miniature chainsaws ; there were at least thirty dif118 CRAIG NELSON ferent bird screams , chatterings , calls and songs ( with one , the bulbul , making a " Whoop-de-doo ! Whoop-de-doo ! " ) . Reptiles were hissing , gibbons were calling out with a cello hoot , and something was making a deep , rough growl that I could n't recognize and certainly did n't want to investigate . It was an animal traffic jam , a contest to aurally dominate the world , and it was clear as day that early humans , hearing all this , created musical instruments just so they could compete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Into the Heart of Borneo : " Eeeeeeee ? ai ? yack yack yack yack ! " Something screamed in my ear , with brain-shredding force . And then everyone joined in . " Eeeeee ? ai ? yack yack yack yack yack yack to y000 ! " answered every other giant male cicada , maniacally vibrating the timbales , drumskin membranes in their cavity amplifiers , the megaphones built into their bodies . " Shut up ! " I shouted . " Wah Wah Wah Wah Wahl " said four thousand frogs . " Stop it at once ! " yelled James . . . . I switched off the torch and tried to sleep . But it was no good . The decibel level was way over the limit allowed in discotheques . And besides , the fire-flies kept flicking their own torches on and off ; and some kind of phosphorescent fungus glowed in the dark like a 40-watt bulb . // She Thinks That Everyone Is Against Her After breakfast , the captain , Harry , the boat boys and I made off for Camp Leakey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on gorillas and Jane Goodall on chimps . This camp was created by Birute Galdikas , the third and least known of the three , who 'd been in Borneo studying the orangutan for over twenty-five years . It has n't been easy . Her first husband , a photographer , got fed up with bush living , fell in love with the nanny , and ran off with her back to the U.S. When Birute 's toddler son started acting more apelike than human , it was thought best for him to go live with them as well ( especially after he 'd started regularly biting the scientists ) . Between the orphan orangs she found and the locals bringing her abandoned pets , Birute soon had a houseful of apes , and as enjoyable in a " barrel of " kind of way as that may sound , caring for big , willful monkeys is in fact something like baby-sitting a family of extremely muscular , extremely stubborn three-year-olds . Besides the massive damage they inflicted on her clothes , furniture and equipment , the orangs loved to suck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their heads through the thatch roofs of her buildings to see if it 'd stopped raining . One rescued ape even attacked one of the camp 's workers , as Birute described in her memoirs : " I began to realize that Gundul did not intend to harm the cook , but had something else in mind . The cook stopped struggling . It 's all right , ' she murmured . She lay back in my arms , with Gundul on top of her . Gundul was very calm and deliberate . He raped the cook . As he moved rhythmically back and forth , his eyes rolled upward to the heavens . Gundul was behaving like
