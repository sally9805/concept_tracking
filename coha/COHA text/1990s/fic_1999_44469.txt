Four years ago , this trio gave us " The True History of the End of the World . " Since then , jL has published novels like Girl in Landscape and most recently Motherless Brooklyn , JK wrote Corrupting Dr. Nice and toils away now on Soft Upset , and JPK won a Hugo Award for " Think Like a Dinosaur and used said story as the title tale in his recent collection . Readers of gentle sensibility might find the name borne by the aliens in this impressive novella a bit coarse , but calling them " nosegays just does n't seem apt ... <p> THE PIX ON MY DESK SAID , " There 's an avatar on the line for you , Liz . Ramsdel Wetherall , looking for an appointment . " Understand that I was as amazed by this as if it had said " Bela Lugosi " or " William the Conqueror . " The idea that Ramsdel Wetherall would want to talk to me was that far-fetched . But my pix could n't be wrong . " Put him off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten minutes . " I needed time to see what I could learn about the reclusive mogul 's latest hijinks . Then I 'd decide if I wanted to let him hijink me . Profit Week called Wetherall 's acquisition of seventy percent of the island nation of Grenada the machinations of an eccentric genius . On Mother 's Day , a panel of experts on News Melt debated Wetherall 's new infodump about management by avatar . They gave it a mixed review . A transcript from America , America hypothesized that the sixth richest man in the world had gone into hiding because he 'd come down with an exotic disease , contracted from one or more of his myriad sexual partners . No , said Channel Lore , the shitdogs had taken over his mind by infiltrating his avatars . Hemisphere Confidential Report had pix of Wetherall indulging his hobby in the smart lasso competition at the sixteenth annual Wyoming Tech Rodeo . He placed second . And just last week Eye had interviewed several astonishingly attractive women in whom Wetherall avatars had expressed a romantic interest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which prohibited disclosure of any personal encounter with Wetherall , should they ever have one . None of them had . Or so they said . The search had turned up about what I 'd expected : too much speculation and not enough facts . And my appointment was in two minutes . Although I 'd never actually interacted with any of Wetherall 's avatars , I 'd seen them before . They gazed serenely from pixes across his financial empire . From time to time they gave interviews that were lighter than air . Personally , I found avatars slick and flat as trademarks ; whenever I met with one I felt as if I were chatting up Betty Crocker or Bill Gates . But still , Ramsdel Wetherall . I took the call . The avatar that filled the screen was roundish and unthreatening . It had short blond hair , slightly tanned smooth skin , and a not very distinct chin . It might have been the face of a man in his twenties- or a fifty-yearold who had never sweated a mortgage payment . " Professor Cobble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm Ramsdel Wetherall . " It smiled as if it 'd been waiting all its life to meet me . I wanted to say No , you 're not ! It was what I liked least about avatars : they acted as if they were the people they represented . Ninety-five percent of the time they operated on their own : buying and selling , lying and telling secrets , flattering and insulting . A busy billionaire like Wetherall could seem to be in two , three , or eleven places at once . The catch was that from time to time the original checked in from afar , and acted and spoke through his digital agent . The real Wetherall might be looking at me through those vapid eyes . Possible but not probable . " How can I help you ? " I said . There were several seconds of silence . The avatar 's smile got bigger and goofier , as if the sheer joy of seeing me had struck it dumb . " Was there something ? " I said . " Would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mystified , I got up and surveyed the campus . A dozen students sunbathed on the quad . Two girls and a dog were playing catch with a Frisbee . A college cop was reading a pix in the shade of the whale statue . " Do you see the white Jolly Freeze van parked in front of Gould Hall ? " said the avatar . I looked . " Yes . " It had no customers , it was n't lit for business , and it was parked in a handicapped spot . There were n't supposed to be ice cream trucks on campus anyway . " Can I interest you in a short ride ? " " Does it come with chocolate sprinkles ? " The avatar laughed uproariously . This worried me - it was n't that funny a joke . " Turn that smile down , would you ? " I said . " It 's getting warm in here . So what 's this all about ? " The avatar sobered instantly . " Do you believe the shitdogs are intelligent ? " I considered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as human beings , I 'd have to say no . Their intelligence is very limited-in a range somewhere between a flounder and a football player . " " What about their vocalizations ? " " They bark . So does Lassie . " " Can I interest you in a short ride ? " " You might , but you have n't . Look , Mr. Wetherall , I 've got a Curriculum Committee meeting in five minutes , and a graduate seminar on Primate Sexology in an hour and a half . I 've got three thesis advisees backed up outside my door and no time to waste giving you a crash course in exobiology . " " I just bought ten square miles of salt flats near Stateline , Nevada , " Wetherall said . " I 'll be right down . " AS WITH RAMSDEL Wetherall , there was too much speculation and too few facts concerning the shitdogs . To start , we did not know where they came from . Astronomers spotted the ship that brought the shitdogs to us only eighteen hours before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Earth before splitting into five vehicles that entered the atmosphere and made soft landings in barren salt flats : Chile 's Atacama Desert , Australia southeast of Lake Disappointment , the Tsagan Nor basin of the Gobi Desert , the Danakil Plain in Ethiopia . And Stateline , Nevada . What followed was well documented at all five landing sites . In the United States , fighters from Edwards Air Force Base scrambled and followed the mushroom-shaped lander to touchdown . The Marines arrived shortly after and cordoned off the area . It was fifty-three minutes before the head of the first shitdog poked out of the lander . The Marines assumed that it was coming through some kind of hatch . It was n't until all five shitdogs had emerged from different exits that the onlookers understood . The shitdogs were eating their spaceship . On my way out I ran into Saintjohn Matthewson , the chair of the department . " Oh , Liz , I 'm glad I caught you before the meeting . I 'm going to need that justification for the new curriculum by next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the sponsors for the freshman chip implant program want to do some more pix of the experimental classroom to include in their annual corporate report . " " But you said I had another month . Registration has n't even turned in the enrollment figures . " " I have every confidence in you , Elizabeth . That 's why I appointed you . " He turned toward the conference room , then paused to admire his profile reflected in the window . " By the way , have you noticed the springs are broken on the sofa in the faculty lounge ? Almost as if someone 's been jumping up and down on it . Have the Building Committee order a new one , and keep the cost down . " " But Saintjohn - " " Oh , and could you be an angel and get the coffee going before we sit down ? I 'm afraid this is going to be a long session . " He cruised ahead of me into the room . I stood outside the door for a moment and took a deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out onto the quad . The pix of Judy Jolly Freeze on the side of the van waved and chuckled at me . " Please step to the rear door , Liz . " As I walked round to the back , pixes of Charley Cone and Billy Bar called out to me in childish voices , " Buy me ! Buy me ! " The heavy rear door swung open and I peered into the van . It was dim and cold - not freezing , but chilly enough to make me wish I 'd brought a sweater . " Come in , come in . " As my eyes adjusted to the light , I saw another Wetherall avatar sitting behind a dark wooden desk . A hologram . Unlike the first avatar , this one was wearing data spex . I saw its breath in the cold air - very lifelike . I was impressed . It mumbled something I could n't quite hear . " I 'm sorry , " I said . " What was that ? " Yellow and blue lights ghosted across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The P/E is eleven , " it said . " I 'm not offering a ruble more than twenty-six . " I wondered if Saintjohn was worried yet . Good old Liz was never late for a meeting . " Maybe I 'd better come back later . " " Absolutely not . Under no circumstances . " It made a swiping motion across the desktop ; I doubted it heard me . " I 'm not interested in a limited partnership . " If I was looking to get ignored , I could do it as easily in the department as here . " Nice place you 've got here , " I said . " All you need is a few penguins . " " You 're cold ? " Its head jerked in surprise . " I find that the body works at peak efficiency when the air temperature is - / il presso migliore che mi pu6 fare , Giacomo ? Liz , I 'm sorry , you should sit down . " I settled reluctantly into the plush chair facing the desk . It was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murk , I 'll get her to sign a release , do n't worry . Yes , I agree . " It nodded , then its voice dropped a register . " I 'm sorry , darling , I 'm spread a little thin at the moment . How about eleven ? I 'll send the limo . " " And all I get is the jolly Freeze van ? " I stood . " Good-bye , Mr. Wetherall . We 'll have to not talk again real soon . " The avatar shot out of its chair . " Liz , please . " It pulled off the spex and dropped them on the desk . " I 'm finished . I promise there will be no further interruptions . " Something about the way the spex bounced against the wood caught my attention . I leaned forward and flicked my forefinger against them . They were real . " You 're you , are n't you ? Ramsdel Wetherall . " He shrugged . " So they tell me . " I sank back in my chair and chuckled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me sign something ? " " That 's Murk 's obsession-my lawyer . " He resumed his seat and did something behind his desk that brought the lights up in the van . For a moment he studied me , as if noticing for the first time that I was a woman . " Should I ? " I may not be Dawn Zoftiggle , but I have my pride . People tell me I 'm attractive  --  smart people , lots of people . On the other hand , I did n't want to give him the impression that I was harboring some romantic design on him . He was Ramsdel Wetherall , after all . " You ca n't buy the shitdogs , " I said , feeling my face flush in the cold air . " I do n't want them . " He opened a desk drawer . " I want their jewels . " I could n't help it ; I laughed at him . He laughed with me . " Ice cream ? " he said . He had a Strawbetty Billy Bar and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the parking lot and I could hear its synthesizer chirp the first four measures of Scott Joplin 's " The Entertainer " over and over again . " Wait a minute ! " I said . " I 've got responsibilities . Classes . A meeting to sleep through . " " I love ice cream . " Ramsdel Wetherall licked a Strawbetty smear from the corner of his mouth . " It 's all I eat these days . Of course , it has to be properly fortified and nutritionally balanced , but that 's why I bought jolly Freeze in the first place . You 've seen jewels up close , right ? At the Stateline site ? " I made myself sit back in the chair . " Sure , " I said . " I 've even seen them die . " When the shitdogs ate their ship , nobody tried to stop them . At that point it was assumed that they were intelligent . They must have perfectly good , if completely alien , reasons for eating their ship . And of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which kept even the toughest Marine at a considerable distance . With the landers gone , we had no clue as to the origin of the shitdogs or the purpose for which they were sent to Earth  --  other than the beasts themselves . Most of my colleagues agreed that the shitdogs were beasts ; the stubborn few who contended that we had n't yet recognized their intelligence because it was so different from our own were trapped in a circular argument . As had been reported any number of times , the shitdogs were not dogs nor were their castings shit - strictly speaking . From direct observation we could see that they were quadrupeds , ranging in hue from powder blue to near indigo . We estimated they weighed almost 3000 kilograms . The largest was fifteen meters in length ; none were shorter than fourteen . They functioned without difficulty in Earth 's gravity . Their forelegs were long and particularly well suited to digging . Each of their three toes culminated in a razor-sharp crystalline claw , hard enough to scratch diamond . They used their short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through salt flats and the piles of their castings . Their faces were composed of a circular maw that could dilate to as much as a meter and a half in diameter . Above that were two external organs the size of tennis balls - eyes , we supposed . An orifice just above the rear legs could iris completely shut , or open to eject a continuous casting approximately twenty-five centimeters in diameter . We 'd been observing shitdog behavior for six years . It consisted mostly of eating and excreting-or intake and output , depending on your model . There was no way to tell whether they were natural or created ; it was entirely possible they were some kind of organic mechanisms . In any event , they tunneled through the salt flats , gorging on a variety of materials , pushing others aside . When they emerged , usually after a period of eight to ten days , their bodies were grotesquely distended . They lay pulsing and inert in the fierce desert sun , digesting- or processing - for as long as a month . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas . At the end of this rest cycle , they would crawl to the casting deposit area , climb or tunnel to an appropriate spot , and release their casting in such a way that it coiled into the conical pile . The odor of a fresh shitdog casting was legendary . The Marines said it was like having barbed wire shoved up your nose . It smelled nothing like the excrement of any animal on Earth ; rather it was biting and bleachy , with just a hint of burning brakes . The castings were composed of long chain polymers , which , when first expelled , were one of the most adhesive substances ever known . The castings cured to a rubbery consistency in about a week , after which time their stench was slightly ameliorated . Because the shitdogs returned again and again to the same area to excrete , some suggested that their behavior was purposeful and that their piles were in fact " buildings , " constructed in much the same way the ancient Egyptians built the pyramids . I found this theory to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conical piles at the Stateline site in the last six years . Each was approximately thirty meters tall ; they were now at work on a third . There were similar piles at the other sites . Public interest in the shitdogs peaked when the first " finished " pile of castings sprouted a two-meter-tall crystalline growth at its peak - the so-called jewels . Outwardly this formation resembled quartz in that it crystallized in the trigonal trapezohedral class of the rhombohedral subsystem of hexagonal symmetry . In their brilliancy , prismatic fire , and color variation , the jewels were nothing like quartz . After long and rancorous debate , a team of scientists tried to retrieve the jewels from the first Ethiopian pile , using lasers manipulated from a helicopter platform . However , as soon as the jewels were taken from the pile , they dissolved into a slurry of shitdog casting . Subsequent attempts , including one in Nevada in which I myself participated , met with similar results . The jewels appeared to be artifacts of the internal chemistry of a finished pile . When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to regenerate a new formation . No one knew why . We in the shitdog studies community suffered from severe fact deprivation . No shitdog had ever died , and to destroy one for the purposes of dissection was unthinkable . Besides , no one had devised a way to catch a shitdog , much less kill one . Attempts had been made to herd them offsite to field laboratories but , when confronted with manmade obstacles , they emitted a string of their famous barks and retreated . The barking , though loud , did not affect humans , but harmonics above the range of human hearing drove dogs , cats , coyotes - even snakes - into panicked flight . The Chileans captured a shitdog once , using a flying crane and a specially constructed claw-shaped cage . They lowered the cage onto one that was in a digestive stupor and the claw swung shut . This roused the beast and it began to bark piteously and hurl itself against the cage with a vigor not previously observed in any of its kind . Its actions were so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the ground safely . Ten minutes later the shitdog had eaten its way to freedom . Unfortunately , except for devotees of xenophobic mediants , a scattering of conspiracy-addled loons , and a few scientists like myself , the world had lost interest in the shitdogs . Funding dried up . And why not ? Their behavior was inscrutable , their origin a mystery , their nature repellent and their treasure ephemeral . So why was Ramsdel Wetherall buying salt flats near Stateline , Nevada ? " I take it you 've seen the jewels in person ? " I said . " I 've been to all five sites . " I whistled . " Even Gobi ? " " I spent an hour last month hovering over Gobi B , close enough to touch the cluster . It has a red ... " He shut his eyes and his face softened with pleasure . I 've seen men look that way after sex or just before cutting into filet mignon and once in front of the Botticelli frescos at the Louvre , but never remembering a rhombohedron . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen , " said Ramsdel Wetherall . Well , at least he was right about that . Then I got suspicious . " Wait a minute . A whole hour ? This does n't have anything to do with Cosmic Lighthouse Keepers ? " He crumpled his ice cream wrapper and tossed it at the trash can on the other side of the van . It missed . " You do n't believe that the jewels might be windows to other realities and the piles are their batteries ? " " Oh , it 's windows and batteries now ? " I said . " Last summer Thorp was claiming they were some kind of beacons . Look , a theory explains observations , Mr. Wetherall . Did you observe another reality ? " " Not yet . " He gave me a dreamy stare . " My friends call me Wetherall . " EVERYONE HAD HEARD of the unfortunate Dr. Blaine Thorp who , after inadvertently getting a smudge of shitdog casting on his right hand , was driven by the smell to perform the self-amputation that almost killed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course of some kind of scientific experiment , a misapprehension that Thorp was happy to encourage . In fact Doctor Thorp 's only advanced degree was from the Palmer College of Chiropractic in Davenport , Iowa . He was a hobbyist and a crackpot and possibly the worst thing to happen to exobiology since the shitdogs ate their landers . Nevertheless he relentlessly promoted himself as the Ahab of the shitdogs , a man whose unique intimacy with these mysterious creatures had somehow given him true insight into their nature . Or should I say insights ; his theories about the shitdogs were as variable as the weather . He announced that the shitdogs do their math in base five . He discerned linguistic symbolism in the paths of their tunneling through the salt flats . He claimed he could tell their emotional state from the color of their castings . And the jewels ... they were either talismans of alien enlightenment or religious icons of an interstellar coprophagy cult or sculptures designed to transform human perception or , as of last Thursday , or whenever Wetherall had spoken to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're in this with Thorp , you 'd better just pull over and let me out right here , " I said . " He 's a fake . " " He did n't fake his accident . I shook his hook when we met . " " I 'll grant he 's missing a hand . For all I know a crocodile bit it off when he was living in Never-Neverland . For that matter , why has n't he had it replaced ? " He permitted himself a smile . " Are you always this uncharitable , Liz ? " " About lunatics like Thorp ? Yes . " " I take it you 've met him then ? I found him very ... persuasive . " " I debated him on Channel Lore two years ago and I still have n't gotten the bad taste out of my mouth . " I leaned forward and thrust my right hand at him so that my mother 's diamond ring was about ten centimeters from the bridge of his nose . " Look , Wetherall , you want to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hold your breath until you pass out . It 'll save us both a lot of time and money . " " Money is not a problem , Liz . " He gently but firmly pushed my hand away . His skin was cool . " I want to build a house as close as possible to the jewel formation growing on Stateline A. Thorp need not be involved . I need a shitdog expert , Liz - the best there is . I need you . " I tried not to be flattered . " A house ! What about the big stink ? " " One man 's problem is another man 's opportunity , " he said . " The stink has its uses . " " Such as ? " He gestured at the inside of the Jolly Freeze truck . " I 'm a man who values privacy as much as great beauty . " I let that go , for now . " Okay . You build a mansion with a picture window that overlooks the jewels . You get yourself the best gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the shitdogs from eating your basement ? " " Have you ever heard of Nguyen O'Hara ? " At that moment I realized that the van was no longer moving and the music had stopped . First Thorp , now O'Hara . Was Wetherall attracted to eccentrics ? Maybe that 's why he had chosen me . Not because of all the time I 'd spent studying the shitdogs , but because I 'd been raised by eccentrics and had learned to tolerate , if not appreciate , strangeness . But how could he know that ? I hoped he had n't found my aunts . " Nguyen O'Hara , the lighter-than-air architect ? " I said . " The man who floats slums ? Did n't he win the Nobel Prize for Hype ? " " Mexico City would have sunk into the mire by now if its colonias were n't aloft . O'Hara 's a genius . " " Putting the poor in balloons works for about eight minutes , " I said . " First come the tourists , then the developers , and before long the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meanwhile ninety percent of the families - the ones not finding a niche in T-shirt sales are forced into some brand new slum that 's ten miles from nowhere . Pretty sleazy if you ask me . Anyway , those bubbleshacks are hardly a billionaire 's digs . " " He calls it lifthousing , " said Wetherall . " And you 've never seen Laputa . " " Laputa ? " " O'Hara 's private lifthouse . I 've arranged for Nguyen himself to give you the tour . " Although I had n't yet said I was interested in his project , Wetherall had read me like an annual report . There was no way I could turn him down - not when he was offering what could be unprecedented access to the shitdogs . " I could clear some time at the end of the week , maybe Friday afternoon . " " Now , " he said . " Now ? " I said . The thought I was even now skipping the Curriculum Committee meeting made me feel strangely giddy . " I 'd want you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Wetherall came around the desk . " I 'm a great believer in team chemistry , Liz . I need to know whether we can all work together . " " I 'm afraid that 's out of the question . I have duties , not just to the university and the department , but to my students . I 'll have to reschedule my appointments , make arrangements for ... " He patted my shoulder . " That 's what avatars are for . " " I do n't have an avatar . " " It 'll all be taken care of . " He ducked past my chair and opened the door of the van ; we were parked on a runway . There was a jet with a picture of Judy Jolly Freeze on its tail fin about twenty meters away . " Wait , I 'm not packed - I do n't even have a toothbrush . " " Money , " he said , " means never having to pack . " He produced a cash card from his shirt pocket and offered it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can buy whatever you need . " He flicked his thumb against the card 's edge . " Buy three of whatever you need . " " But where are we going ? " He slipped his arm around me and aimed me at the jet . " Las Vegas , " he said . As we approached The Zones Resort &; Casino , I could see Nguyen O'Hara 's Laputa hovering some thirty meters over the parking garage . On the roof deck directly beneath it was the truck that served as its ground station . The sides of this vehicle were enormous pix ; they cycled through a montage of people of various ages and races and social classes , all pointing up in wonder at the marvelous floating house . Satisfied customers , apparently . We 'd been met at McCarran Airport by yet another Jolly Freeze van . I was caught off guard when Wetherall ushered me to the cab and then climbed beside me and slid behind the wheel . He had scooted the ungainly van through the traffic on the strip like a teamster late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the garage 's tightly spiraling ramp . We parked near the truck . I craned my neck ; Laputa 's shadow grew as it descended slowly toward us . I was so busy goggling that I did n't notice the dapper man until his smiling face appeared at the driver 's side window . He knocked and then waved . " Come in , come in ! " Wetherall opened the door and slid across the bench seat toward me . " Liz Cobble , meet Nguyen O'Hara . " O'Hara climbed in behind the wheel and shut the door . " My dear Wetherall , you must either turn down the air-conditioning or pass out blankets . Good to have you aboard , Liz . " He extended a hand ; Wetherall flattened himself against the seat so we could shake . " I 'm glad there 's finally one sane person on this project . " " Only one ? " I said . " Well , I 'm hardly qualified to make representations about my own mental health . " He spoke with a slight German accent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face ; his neat mustache had flecks of gray in it . There were epicanthic folds at the corners of his dark eyes . While the cut of his suit was conservative , it was the color of butter- his trademark , apparently . He smiled in an entirely different way from Wetherall . Wetherall 's smile was bluff and straightforward . Nguyen 's grin was sly and insinuating , as if inviting you in on a joke . I found him instantly attractive . He immediately launched into the story of a woman down in the casino who , only moments before , had pulled a hammer out of her purse and begun to bludgeon the poker machine she 'd been playing . When several bystanders attempted to intervene , security had rushed to her defense . " It turns out she 's a destruction artist , hired by the casino to commit random acts of vandalism for the amusement of the guests ! These people certainly take their spectacle seriously . " He laughed as though he were being tickled . I glanced up again at Laputa . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , suspended beneath a yellow balloon . As it eased to a stop , two multi-jointed arms unfolded from its underside ; at the same time a boom with built-in stairs rose up from the truck , hydraulics singing . The arms reached for the boom and locked onto it . A hatch opened and I glimpsed a man dressed in a blue uniform and a butter-colored beret . He disappeared . Through the hatch shuffled a stream of people , forty or fifty strong . It was a middle-aged crowd ; most wore sneakers and shorts and pix shirts . What was strange was that they each had one what looked like butter yellow boxing glove . " Tourists ? " I asked Nguyen . He nodded . " The operating costs for a floating house of this quality are quite steep . And unlike my friend Wetherall , I 'm not financially independent . If you assume forty sightseers at forty dollars a head times four tours then I make about sixty-five hundred dollars a day from opening Laputa to my public . " At the bottom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ushered tourists onto a waiting bus . " More than two million dollars a year , " said Wetherall approvingly . " And to think they gave you a MacArthur Grant for your architecture . " " You let all those people tramp through your house ? " I said . " What 's good enough for the King of England is good enough for me . " Nguyen peered through the windshield . " I do apologize for the delay . It 'll be safe to go out in another minute or two . " " What are the gloves for ? " " Cuts down on breakage - and pilferage . By the way , I 'm halfway through your infodump on shitdog psychology . " " Actually , I wrote it as a book . " " Is that so ? Very readable , nevertheless . You do n't think like most academics . I 'm intrigued when you say the shitdogs are not at all proprietary about their finished piles . " " They did n't seem to care when we cut the jewels at Stateline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I wonder what they 'd do if we wrapped them in plastic . Some sort of smell abatement device , like a giant baggie . No ? " He giggled , then opened the door of the van . " Just a thought . Shall we go ? " He had timed his exit so that the tourists would be able to see him from their moving bus . The windows filled almost immediately with faces . Nguyen smiled and gave them a brisk wave . Wetherall ducked back into the van . I could n't help but see his look of alarm as he cowered behind the dashboard . After the tour bus had disappeared down the ramp , I gave him a gentle nudge . " They 're only people , Wetherall . They do n't bite . " " Some of them do , " he said . We were met at the truck by two attendants . On closer inspection I could see their uniforms were n't actually a solid blue but rather a pattern : Nguyen O'Hara 's dense calligraphic signature repeated over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Nguyen . " Not really . Somebody dropped chocolate on the carpet in the billiards room . Nothing the cleanbots could n't take care of . " " Very good . I 'll be in conference here the rest of the day , so dismiss the tour staff . We 'll open tomorrow at ten . Friday we move to the site . " He led us up the stairs . The risers were pix on which messages flashed sequentially , so that Nguyen 's canned greeting cascaded down at us like a waterfall of words : Welcome to Laputa . Keep in mind You are entering a private residence . Food , drink and photography are prohibited . Your visit will last about an hour . Please note : there are no restrooms . " What kind of house has no bathrooms ? " I said . Nguyen paused at the open hatch and flicked several switches , turning the message off and lights on inside the lifthouse . " Oh , that 's only to discourage the tourists . Water is about fourteen kilograms per liter ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when we 're over a city we ca n't void waste to the air . " He ushered us up the circular stairs . I 'VE NEVER BEEN able to get past my first impression of Laputa : an odd combination of a yacht and my Aunt Galadriel 's house . A yacht in that , with the exception of a few movable pieces , all the furniture and chairs were built in . There were no open shelves ; what was not stored in the beautifully joined cupboards was battened down behind transparent sheets of nuglass . Aunt Galadriel lived by herself ; in the days before cleanbots , she 'd kept a house that was sterile enough to recombine DNA in . Aunt Lindsay and Aunt Kym 's house , where I grew up , is a mess , so I always felt a vague sense of guilt when I visited Aunt Galadriel , as if by the mere act of breathing I might be disrupting an order she had taken years of hard labor to impose on her environment . Aunt Galadriel would have approved of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place a man with a weakness for yellow suits would have to live in . Laputa had three donut-shaped levels that surrounded a central utility core . In the core were plumbing , water , and waste storage , heating and ventilation , the VTEMF generator , the homebrain and a 300 kilowatt Pons power plant that provided electricity for the living quarters and heated the helium in the envelope . Most of the floors were done in pliatex which could be varied with firmness from a mudlike consistency to diamond hardness ; all of the open walls were pixes , which could display any color or show any scene stored in the computer . Nguyen called up the palette on a sloping wall in the living room to display the 6.7 million available colors . " Personally , " he said , " I worry about visual overstimulation , which is why I rarely stray from my defaults . I 'm afraid I 'm perceptually old-fashioned . I only use the pixwalls to allow clients to get a feel for the possibilities . " Above the living quarters was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not seem much interested in taking in the view . Nguyen led us back down to the bottom level , divided between the entrance gallery and a conference room . Part of the floor here was the exterior hull itself . As we entered the conference room , he made a section of the deck transparent ; the garish splendor of the Strip was spread beneath our feet like a two-hundred-dollar whore . " Excuse me , Nguyen . " Wetherall was suddenly pale , " but it 's awfully warm in here , do n't you think ? Could we turn up the air-conditioning ? " " We can go as high as a hundred and fifty meters , " he said to me as he opaqued the floor , " which is the limit of the phased VTEMF generators in the truck and the core . Unfortunately , some people find the view from this height vertiginous . " He smiled . " Just why such a person would want to build a lifthouse is beyond me . " " The view is not a problem , " Wetherall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed his eyes at the ceiling . " Actually , I think I 'm getting to like heights , " he told the crown molding . " I just have to prepare myself for it . " Nguyen opened a cabinet door , which revealed a rolled-up rope ladder with teak treads . " In case of an emergency , you can use this to get down quickly . " " Getting down too quickly is what I 'm afraid of , " Wetherall said . He loosened his collar and then waved for us to join him . " I 'm fine . Let 's get started . " We sat around the conference table . At its center was a holographic simulation of the Stateline site . Two tiny shitdogs crawled like slugs on the unfinished C pile . " Our most critical design restraints have to do with lift and control , " Nguyen said . " In almost all cases , the envelope will provide enough buoyancy to keep the house aloft , although we should expect that there will be times when the VTEMF generators will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be used to anchor the house in its fixed position . " " So you 're going to need some kind of base , " I said . " Near the pile . " " Well , we could do away with magnetic fields altogether by making Wetherall 's house a propeller-driven airship . Of course , it would need a full-time pilot .... " " No pilots , " said Wetherall firmly . " No stewardesses or servants or mechanics or people of any sort . This is the one place in the world where I can be by myself . " " I wo n't rule an airship out , " Nguyen said , " but I agree that it 's not a very elegant solution . Besides , an airship would probably require an even more elaborate base station , including a hangar for shelter during extreme wind conditions . And there would of course be periodic equipment inspections and repair . No , I would prefer a Laputa-like solution ; a helium balloon locked in place by a very tight electromagnetic tether . " He leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first major decision : where do we site the base generator ? Ideally , we would want to build something permanent . The maximum range of a fixed VTEMF generator locked in phase with a smaller portable such as the one here on Laputa is about twenty-five hundred meters . It would be best if we could locate the base on a height , where it will be safe from shitdog depredations . " He touched the A pile and then drew his finger out about forty centimeters . " So if we create a circle with its center at A and with a radius of twentyfive hundred meters ... " A white circle appeared on the simulation . " ... we see that we are tantalizingly close to several elevated sites . Here to the west we have this spur of the Pilot mountain range ; to the south are the Leppy Hills . How close must you be to the jewels , Wetherall ? " " Close enough to touch . " " Sheer extravagance . " Nguyen shook his head ruefully . " I would expect nothing less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is where we 'll need your expertise , Liz . How far will the shitdogs range ? " " Impossible to predict , " I said . " While they rarely go more than a couple of kilometers from the working pile , one of the Australian shitdogs made a documented run of over eight kilometers . Plus we do n't know where they 'll decide to start the next pile or how many they 'll eventually build . " " Which means we may have to abandon the fixed base concept . If the shitdogs were to eat his base generator , Wetherall here would find himself taking an untethered balloon ride on the prevailing winds . In the unlikely event that he made it over the Wasatch Mountains , he almost certainly would come to grief in the Southern Rockies . " " What if we bury the base ? " said Wetherall . " Expensive , but worth considering- although you still run the risk of having the shitdogs destroy your access . Liz , suppose a shitdog is in a hurry . How fast could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly been able to clock them in a race . But in short spurts , as fast as a man , maybe faster . Say thirty-two kilometers an hour . " " So a mobile base similar to my truck down there should be able to outpace a charging shitdog ? " " One shitdog is no problem . But if you were trying to escape a pack of them , there might be trouble . " " I did n't think they traveled in packs , " said Wetherall . " They did on the way here , " I said . " Here is my proposal . " Nguyen waved at the hologram and it winked out . " Wetherall , I think we should begin design of your lifthouse immediately , using Laputa as a model . That part of the project ought to go forward , regardless of the final base solution - even if we decide to build you an airship . In the meantime , I 'll be moving Laputa to Stateline to survey the site . Liz , I 'd like you to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nguyen pushed back from the table and walked across the room . " We 'll have to make a more precise determination of the shitdogs " tolerance of incursions . What sort of activities and/or structures get their attention ? What 's the deepest they 've dug underground ? Exactly how fast do they move ? What is the likelihood of cooperative behaviors ? " " I 'll have to take a leave of absence . " The idea would have been unthinkable a few hours earlier . Now I contemplated it with some enthusiasm . I guess I 'd joined the team . " And the kind of research you 're asking for is going to cost .... " " Do n't worry , " said Wetherall . " That 'll be taken care of . " Nguyen opened a cabinet and brought out three crystal glasses and a winebell of Pommery &; Greno . " We are agreed then ? " He popped the cork , grinning . I wondered what he was so happy about . The design ? The commission ? The chance to associate himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Nguyen , raising his champagne . " And their jewels . " I touched my glass to his . " To solitude . " Wetherall drained his glass , set it back on the conference table , and glanced at his datacuff . " Excuse me , but I 've got to be in Munich , Islamabad , and Cornwall , Connecticut , in about fifteen minutes . " The pix on the back of the door of my room - or rather , my suite at The Zones informed me that the fire escape was seven doors down the hall to my left . I asked it the nightly rate : eight hundred thirty dollars . I had once spent a week at Sebago Lake in Maine for eight hundred fifty dollars , but then the camp I 'd rented had n't come with a waterfall , a Steinway , or a bed the size of the District of Columbia . The room looked like a set for a gropie of The Thief of Baghdad . When Wetherall had checked me in , he 'd said he 'd call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only after he 'd left that I realized I did n't know what later or dinner meant to a billionaire . It seemed a safe assumption that we 'd be going out somewhere , except that Wetherall clearly had an aversion to being seen in public . And I had no idea how long he 'd need to honcho his avatars through their meetings . Would we be dining at eight ? Ten ? Midnight ? Should I order room service in the meantime ? Did I have time to go down to the casino , skim a couple of hundred off Wetherall 's card and gamble ? I kicked off my shoes , vaulted onto the bed and bounced . I freely admit that jumping on beds that do n't belong to me is a childish habit that has persisted far too long into my adulthood , but it helps settle me down when I 'm on the road . Besides , I liked it that this was something no one knew about me . Everything was happening so fast . I was probably going to get my picture in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtless ruin my reputation in the department , I enjoyed picturing Saintjohn 's reaction . That 's right , Dr. Matthewson , I skipped the Curriculum Committee meeting for this . And freshmen do n't need chip implants - they should be reading books . By authors . Then there was the problem of carrying my course load with the fall semester already three weeks old . Wetherall would probably have to build an addition to the library to make up to the university for that . Meanwhile , I had just agreed to move to Stateline , Nevada , with Nguyen O'Hara and his sly smile . Where was I going to stay ? Stateline had no Sheraton . It was a good bed for bouncing on . Wetherall 's avatar called at eight . I could tell it was the avatar by its witless smile . " Hi , Liz . Are you hungry yet ? " " I could eat . " I casually motioned for the hairdresser to stand in front of the coffee table , blocking the avatar 's view of the Peking ravioli I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for eight-thirty . Is that all right ? " " I 'll have to check my calendar . How dressed are we getting ? " " As you see . " It was wearing a high-collared white shirt and a blue suit . It hit me that Wetherall was n't bad looking , in a boyish way . " Can you be ready in twenty minutes ? " It did n't wait for an answer . The hairdresser was looking at me in awe . " That was Ramsdel Wetherall . " " Actually , " I said , offering her Wetherall 's cash card , " it was an array of electrons with an attitude . " She stared at the card and then back up at me . " If you 're thinking glamorous , you 've got it all wrong , " I said . " He 's - strange . " " I 've heard that , " she said . Standing behind me , she lifted the hair from the back of my head and sighed ; her eyes met mine in the mirror . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use your own hair . I can give you a smartwig . " I eyed the brown pageboy bob I had wom since grad school . " Thanks , but no thanks . " " Still- " I shooed her away with a hundred dollar tip . There was nothing wrong with my hair and even if there was , I did n't need to know about it . I undressed , swept through the scanner in the closet door and activated the virtual Ragusa in the clothes processor . A few minutes later I emerged in a long-sleeved black velvet gown that grazed my ankles . It had light boning and back smocking . The sweetheart neckline was just off the shoulders . I 'm told I have good shoulders . There was a knock at the door . I paused in front of the mirror . So I might 've looked better if I 'd had an Arpels necklace dangling to my decolletage , but for short notice this would do . I was a professor , not a runway model . And the dinner was actually an appointment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , and who knew what else ? But to the world it would be a date with Ramsdel Wetherall . I wondered about the women he normally dated . Did any of them wear their own hair ? When I opened the door I was greeted not by Wetherall , but by a severe , angular man in a charcoal suit that looked like it cost more than my car . He tried to smile but did n't seem to have had much practice at it . " Good evening , Dr. Cobble . I 'm Murk janglish , Mr. Wetherall 's lawyer . Perhaps he 's mentioned me to you ? " He slipped through the door like a watermelon seed . " I hope you do n't mind my doing a security check before we go down . " He took out a wand and , craning up and down on his knees like a human ironing board , ran it over the length of my body . Then he inspected my irises and hands . " Do you want to check my teeth ? " " Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head to one side . " I do n't know about the hair , though . " I let that go . " I take it Wetherall sent you to pick me up ? " " Actually , he overlooked it . Details are not his strength-that 's why I 'm needed . " " I thought the point of all those avatars was to free him from the details . " " His avatars are too good , I 'm afraid . They replicate the man himself and all his foibles . They generate almost as much trouble for me as he does . Look , I 'd appreciate it if you did n't distract Mr. Wetherall . He 's a little scattered at the moment . " " Distract him ? In what way ? " He stared at me as if I 'd just fallen off the bam . " That 's all right . On second thought , I do n't think there will be any problems . May I escort you down ? " His gesture at the door might have appeared polite if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his other hand . MURK JANGLISH showed me to the Rain Forest Restaurant in the Tropical Zone of the hotel . He led me to one of the rafts moored on the river that looped through the vastness of the restaurant . The raft had a circular palm-thatched roof from which hung a heavy curtain of mosquito netting - not that there were any mosquitos . Inside the netting was a table set for two . In gold . " He 'll be here , " Janglish said . " Sign everything he gives you . " And he left . While I listened to the calls of exotic birds and admired the hordes of butterflies flitting among the branches of the big trees , I ignored the grinding of my stomach and awaited Wetherall . After a few minutes , a tall , awkward-looking man in a safari jacket and khaki hat with a snakeskin hatband detached himself from the bar and sidled past the suddenly oblivious maitre d " toward the raft . He parted the netting , and took the chair opposite me . Immediately the raft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Excuse me ... " The man took off the bushman 's hat and brushed his luxuriant brown hair away from his face . It was Wetherall . " What happened to your blue suit ? " I asked . " Privacy is always worth the effort . " He stuck his leg out from beneath the tablecloth , pulled up on the knee of his pants . " Leg extenders , " he said , grinning loonily . He touched his face . " Skin polarizer . " He grabbed a strand of his hair and shook it . " Smartwig . " The hair twisted out of his hand and tucked itself back behind his ear . Wetherall slung a backpack from off his shoulder and pulled out a folder . " I have a few things for you to sign . " His savoir-faire took my breath away . " Right , " I said . " The liability waiver . " Wetherall looked momentarily fuddled . " Damn , I forgot . Janglish will have my head . No , this is about your avatar . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the folder because I could see the sommelier paddling toward our table . Actually , she was being paddled by a busboy . She stood in a dugout canoe , cradling a bottle of wine . Other diners looked down at us from tables perched on platforms in the trees that lined the river . The sommelier ducked through the netting to present the wine to Wetherall . " Tokay is sweet , almost like syrup . " Wetherall sniffed the taste the sommelier had poured for him and waved his approval . " It 's the only wine I can drink with dinner . You know , it is hot in here . " " Shall I open the netting ? " said the sommelier . " No , no , " said Wetherall . " It 's just me . I 'll be fine . " The sommelier filled our glasses and headed for shore . I opened the folder and scanned the form on top . " An avatar is more trouble than I want to get into . " " It only takes a few hours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , and you 'll have to allow them access to some of your personal databases . " His expression was innocent . " Do n't worry , it 's all very secure . " I could see how some women might find those deep , guileless eyes - not to mention two hundred and thirty-eight billion dollars - sexy . " But what do I need one for ? " " To teach your classes . To handle the press . To order materials , manage your research team , search databases . To remember why you thought what you 're doing now was such a good idea . Believe me , in a few weeks it 'll be hard to imagine how you got along without one . " " What do you mean , teach my classes ? " " I had to promise your Saintjohn Matthewson and the dean that there would be no academic disruption . " " What gave you the right to interfere ? " " I told you everything would be taken care of . " I glared at him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent , I go after it - you know that now . I like to keep my top talent focused . As long as you work for me , I 'll try to see to it that you .... " A bright green parrot dropped out of the trees and landed on the rail of our raft . " ... that you live in a worry-free ... " The parrot bobbed its head , turned sideways to examine us with a lustrous black eye . Wetherall hunched over and put his hand to his face . " What 's wrong ? " " I think that bird might be rigged for pix . " " Naah . Looks more like a bomb to me . " For a second I thought he might dive under the table . " Oh , that was joke , " he said . " Perhaps you could signal when you are making an attempt at humor ? " He spun his hat at the parrot and it bounced off the netting . " Hey , you bird ! Raaah ! " At this , the parrot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , picking up the hat , " since I have access to certain resources , I was in a position to ease your transition from the university to my project . " " How many resources did it take ? " He shrugged . " When you get back , there should be a warm body sitting in the Wetherall Chair for the Study of Twentieth-Century Popular Music . " " You mean like jazz ? Rock and roll ? " " I have every record the Kinks ever made - on the original vinyl . " I was a little dizzy . The thought of Saintjohn being pushed around like a baby in a stroller was vastly satisfying , and I could n't help but feel a little exhilarated . With a wave of his hand Wetherall had made the job and the people I spent most of my days worrying about dissipate like a cloud of smoke . On the other hand , I felt annoyed that , for a pile of cash and a popculture sinecure , the university would release me from rules they had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in where I rated in relation to the world of money . I set the avatar authorization aside for the time being and glanced at the next document . There was a cash card attached to a personal services contract . I separated the card and checked the balance . It was twice my annual salary . " Wait a minute . I thought this was going to be a quick little consultancy . I 'm a teacher . I 'm not giving you more than six months , tops . " " I 'm not asking you to , " he said . " Six months should be more than enough . This is your first month 's pay . In advance . " " You ca n't buy me , Wetherall , " I said weakly , even though he knew that I knew that he already had . The raft bumped against a waiter 's station , guided by some unseen system . Our waiter stepped aboard briskly , set a plate in front of me and uncovered it with a flourish . " For you , Madam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Mochalicious Jolly Freeze . " He topped off our glasses . " Enjoy your meal . " After dinner we strolled through the lobby of the Zones . Wetherall was n't in his usual hurry to be off to some other appointment . After I 'd signed his contracts , our dinner conversation had shifted to pleasantries . Until Wetherall mentioned my parents . " Was it hard growing up without parents ? " he asked . " You know about that ? " " Yes . " I was n't about to tell him any more than he needed to know . Especially since I did n't know what he 'd spied out about me already . " Lots of children survive without parents . You grew up without a father , did n't you ? it Everyone knew the story of the impoverished childhood that had preceded his rise to wealth . " Mother was resourceful . We did n't live too far from here - in Colorado . " So we parried evasions for a while . Not that I cared about his childhood . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motor oil . We were standing near the doors when Dr. Blaine Thorp found us . " Ah-hah ! " he said , sticking out his hook accusingly . " What 's he doing here ? " I said to Wetherall . Thorp ignored me and turned to Wetherall . " So Professor Cobble has superseded me in your plans , " he said . " I did n't realize that your work required the imprimatur of drab officialdom - I thought you were a visionary ! " " Well , Blaine , " said Wetherall , " even visionaries need something solid to stand on . Liz here is of the opinion that your science is rather shaky . " " You liken yourself to the jewels , and everyone else to the pile below ! " thundered Thorp . " I wonder how Professor Cobble feels about that comparison . " " Oh , please , " I said . A reporter who 'd been staking out Thorp as he staked out the lobby wheeled , his spex trained on us . I turned to see Wetherall 's reaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You lunatic , " I said to Thorp . " Why do we have to be in the same field ? Why do we have to be on the same planet ? " " You suffer from what Freud called the " narcissism of minor differences , " my dear , " said Thorp . The reporter 's spex reflected the overheads . I 'd anticipated being linked with Wetherall in tomorrow 's papers . Now it was going to look like I 'd put on this gown for a date with a chiropractor with delusions of grandeur . I could already hear the laughter of my colleagues . " I do n't know that one . " I glanced around the lobby , wondering if I 'd really lost Wetherall . " But I 'm sure you 'll explain . " Maybe he was lurking behind one of the marigold trees . " Simply put , we most intensely dislike those with the greatest similarities to ourselves . They threaten us . Hindus hate Muslims , not Chinese , et cetera . Therefore , you despise me because I reflect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Where 's the narcissism ? " " Have you glanced in a mirror recently ? " " More recently than you 'd imagine . " " So , you feel undue love for those minor characteristics that define your difference from me - primarily your academic sinecure  --  while ignoring the central resemblance . " Noticing the photographer , he struck a triumphant pose with his hook . " The irony is , your replacing me in Wetherall 's regard was part of my plan . " " How can we replace you when you wo n't go away ? " a voice broke in . It was Wetherall , back again , trailed by Murk Janglish . Something was going awry with Wetherall 's smartwig , and the hair was climbing up around his hat like a many-tendrilled octopus . Meanwhile Janglish was tugging awkwardly on Wetherall 's elbow - elbows seemed to be the lawyer 's specialty . " Ramsdel , " Janglish said , " please . This is n't necessary . Your presence will only focus attention on this situation . " The reporter had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light glinted in the corner of his spex . " I 'll go away when the secret of the jewels is revealed , " Thorp said to Wetherall . " And you and Ms. Cobble are just the ones to do it for me . You 'll work from the inside while I guide you from without . Together , the three of us- " " Together , the three of us will do nothing , " Wetherall said . " Mr. Wetherall , " I said . " It 's okay , I can handle him- " " I 've no doubt you can , Dr. Cobble , " Wetherall said . " But you 're working for me now , and I stand by my employees . Dr. Thorp , " he said , " if you have any complaints about your treatment , take them up with Mr. Janglish here . " Wetherall held out his arm , I took it , and pushing past the photographer , we went straight to the elevator and up to my suite . Once inside , Wetherall seemed to get an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head and eyed the door nervously . " You can wait here while things cool off downstairs , " I said . " That 's not the way the paparazzi work . The longer I wait the more of them will gather . " He handed the wig to me . " Would you take care of this ? " He slipped out of the room before I could ask him what to feed it . So I plopped onto a chair the size of a subcompact car , kicked a Donya Durand shoe at the mirror and then stared into it , trying to find the simple , boring Professor Liz Cobble who had gotten out of bed that morning . At least my hair did n't crawl all over my scalp . Sometimes I blamed my aunts for turning me into that boring Professor Liz Cobble . Aunt Lindsay was Professor of Vertebrate Semiology at the University of Wisconsin , and Aunt Kym ran the only sensory deprivation spa in Madison . Growing up in their purple and pink Victorian house had been much more of an adventure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew I could never be normal again , I could at least seem normal . Except the outside world was certain that I was living with a pair of lunatics . The fact that Aunt Lindsay and Aunt Kym loved me only made things harder . For their part , they were open minded when I insisted on wearing clothes to school and dating outside of my gender , although I could tell they thought I was being oppressed by the patriarchy and commodified by the Bank of America . I became a little reclusive , and a little prickly about challenges to my own way of doing things . I spent a lot of time as a child watching myself for signs that I would end up like them , and in reaction I became Ms. Dutiful Grind . But I still remember the smell of the scented electrolyte that always clung to Aunt Kym like the oddest of perfumes , eau d'inconscience collective . And Aunt Lindsay teaching me to read as I sat on her lap and she took me through her charts of the seven stages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't a surprising career choice for somebody with a seeker of primal truths in place of one parent and a student of the sign language of animals in place of the other . But I 'd intended to be entirely more sober about the way I lived than my aunts . Except that here I was , rattling around in a new jar of mixed nuts . Fanatic Blaine Thorp and pathetic Ramsdel Wetherall , soft Nguyen O'Hara and hard Murk Janglish . And me . I had only myself to blame . One day after my dinner with Wetherall , Nguyen O'Hara and I started for Stateline aboard Laputa , which was being towed by the base truck on its electromagnetic tether . The guest rooms aboard the lifthouse were lavishly outfitted , if not exactly up to Zones standards . Wetherall had arranged to have my office chair and desk moved overnight so I would feel comfortable in my work environment . I chatted briefly with one of his jolly avatars , who said he 'd gone ahead to coordinate the arrival of equipment and supplies . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfolded before us . The dwarfing effect of the expanse always catches me by surprise , no matter how many times I visit the desert . The absolute white and flat of the evaporated salt plains takes ordinary vastness to the level of the conceptual : Earth 's tabula rasa . The human mind flinches from the blank page . All we can do is build scrawny highways through to the next inhabitable place , out from under the hammer of weather , off the edge of the table of the possible . Whatever their reasons , the shitdogs had chosen the loneliest place on Earth . Ordinarily the loneliest . For , by the time we arrived at the rendezvous point , we were n't alone . The combination of the Wetherall angle , the Laputa photo op , and the public confrontation with Thorp had rekindled interest in the Stateline site . Two kilometers west of the shimmering piles and dark entrenchments of shitdog territory , a sprawl of vans and campers and bubbles had sprung up ; it was almost the size of the army of reporters that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wetherall 's people had marked off the boundary of his property , and the media had nested just outside it , on public land . I had no doubt one of Wetherall 's avatars was negotiating for its purchase even as we watched . As we approached the encampment , the base truck shortened our tether , until we hovered only fifteen meters above the salt flat . I wondered what Nguyen was doing . I was n't in suspense for long ; the truck parked between the Time/Pepsi compound and the News Melt van . Laputa was to be the star attraction of the media circus . The truck began to reel us in for boarding . I FOUND NGUYEN in his office . " You 're docking right in the middle of the feeding frenzy ? " " Indeed , " said Nguyen . " Someone has to be the story-why not us ? It was Wetherall " s idea , actually . He asked that we stay here to divert attention . He wants to discourage flyovers at the worksite or the piles . Wise , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " My tongue swells up and my IQ drops . " Nguyen did n't hear me . He peered intently down at the crowd that was gathering around his truck . I thought he might be taking a head count . " You like this , do n't you ? The publicity ? " " Whether I like it or not is beside the point . It 's part of the business . I 'm an architect , Liz . Do you have any idea how many of us are left ? " I shook my head . " Any computer can design a building these days . All I have to sell is style . If people do n't know who I am , then how will they know that I have it ? If you 're not comfortable with reporters , let your avatar handle them . That 's what Wetherall does . He 's famous for his accessibility , which is a nice trick considering he 's a recluse . " There were at least a hundred people beneath us now . Most were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifthouse from the rear of the truck . " But if we 're in the middle of everything , how is Wetherall going to get on board ? They 'll spot him in a minute . " He glanced up at me , surprised , then nodded as if he had just discovered an interesting secret . " But Wetherall is n't staying here , Liz . That was never the plan . " He showed me the sly O'Hara smile . " Sorry to disappoint , but it 's just the two of us . " No sooner had he said this than his screen blinked : a call . I expected Wetherall , or a Wetherall avatar , but it was Murk Janglish . " We need to discuss your contract , O'Hara , " began Janglish , without saying hello . " You 've lined out all the work-for-hire language . That wo n't do . " " My name is Nguyen . Say Ngu-yen . " " Say it ? Why ? " " You and Wetherall are like good-cop , bad-cop . " Nguyen smiled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punish . " Murk Janglish seemed taken aback . " I 'm sending you a clean copy , " he said . " You need to sign it . No changes . " " All right , Murk . " Nguyen 's expression was saintly . " But only if you deliver it in person . " " Why the hell would I do that ? " " Why the hell would I do that , Nguyen , " said Nguyen O'Hara . Janglish 's screen went dark . " I do n't know whether to describe that as a bad personality or no personality , " I said . " Oh , it 's a personality , " said O'Hara . The first thing I noticed as I came down the stairway was the big stink . The piles were two kilometers away and the air was dead calm and still there it was , like a bituminous skunk in the next door neighbor 's yard . Unpleasant , but not yet painful . I had put on a Laputa uniform so that I could pass as one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretch my legs and he had told me that I was free to go as I pleased . That was n't true exactly . Once the reporters figured out who I was , I 'd be trapped in the lifthouse , unless I was willing to give interviews . Which I was definitely not . I was going to let my avatar do all the talking , just as soon as Wetherall delivered it . I wandered through the colony , listening to the journalists grouse . They complained about the big stink , of course , and the heat and the boredom and the bad food and the power rationing . Fox had ordered another Solelectric array from Salt Lake City , but it would n't be operational until'next Monday . Several locals from Wendover were trucking in fresh water , which they were happy to sell to the fourth estate at champagne prices . I discovered one vehicle I knew all too well : Blaine Thorp 's " Dog Squad " car . I ducked behind an old school bus before anyone saw me and then sighted back on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure never to come this way again . I was n't interested in public debates with the lunatic . It was about ten minutes later that I noticed the Billy Bar wrapper stuck to the flap of a trashcan . I lifted the lid ; there were more inside . I knocked on doors nearby until a woman from Izvestia directed me to the Jolly Freeze van parked at the easternmost edge of the colony . The sides were dark ; the pix of Judy Jolly Freeze sat in a chair , hands folded neatly in her lap , her eyes closed . " Wetherall ? " I walked around the van twice , hunting for some sign of life , then knocked at the rear door . " Wetherall ! " " Liz ? " Judy opened one eye . " Ssssh ! " She pointed . " Over here . " I went around to the side of the van that faced the empty salt vastness . At first I could n't see Wetherall 's avatar , because it was only half a meter tall and hiding behind Billy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wetherall , " I said . " I just saw Thorp 's car . Let me in . " " I 'm not here , " said the avatar . " And I ca n't talk right now . " " But you are talking . Where are you ? " " Not far , a motel . I 'll see you in a few days . " The avatar turned away from me and gestured at someone I could n't see . " No , no , not you . Her . I 'll be there in a minute . " " Wetherall , are you with someone ? " " It 's just business . Stay right where you are . " " What do you mean , stay where I am ? Where would I go ? " " Very good , Cobble . " The avatar 's voice was full of false camaraderie . " You do that , all right ? Good night now . " And then it faded . Where its image had cowered , there was only a smooth silver glow in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who Wetherall slept with . I only felt sorry for her . So what if he had come back to save me at the Rain Forest ? He 'd called me Cobble , like I was some junior assistant nobody . I pounded the van with the side of my hand ; I think I got Billy Bar right in his pudgy little chin . " My friends call me Liz , asshole . " It was only on the way back to Laputa that it hit me : Why would the avatar have to be insulting , when it could spend as much time with me as necessary , while the real Wetherall was with his bimbo ? Was n't that the point of avatars ? Unless it had been the real Wetherall who answered my call . But that was even more inexplicable : why would he take my call if he were in a motel room with some other woman ? I was back in control by the time I got back to Laputa . I had to be if I intended to pass safely under the quizzical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided not to harbor any ill feelings - or any feelings at all - toward Wetherall . " I 'm back , Nguyen . " I called , as I climbed the stairway to the living room . " In here , Liz , " he replied from the kitchen . He was sitting at the table with his back to me . I could n't see at first what he was doing , but I could smell it . " What 's going on ? " I asked . He had a half dozen saucers arranged in front of him . " Ammoniaformula EasyWipe , " he said , pointing . " Vicks Vaporub . Diced vitamins . " Two of the saucers contained a scatter of burned remains . " Plastic and rubber , " he said and then indicated a ruined something that might once have been an orange or maybe an apple if it had n't been covered with a greenish , tennis-ball fur . " I retrieved this lovely from the bottom of the composter . " There was a odd slackness at the corners of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nguyen , we 've got more stink than we can handle already . " " A very thoughtful man . " Nguyen lowered his face dangerously close to the Vaporub saucer and breathed deeply . " A saint , actually . " " Who ? " " Our good friend Wetherall . " Nguyen took a little brown bottle from his shirt and shook it . A handful of pills rattled inside . " Sent us a nosegay . " He gave me a dreamy , very un-Nguyen-like leer . I managed not to tell him just how Saint Wetherall was spending his time while O'Hara and I camped out in Laputa . The pills Nguyen had dubbed nosegays were prototypes of an antistink drug that Wetherall had commissioned . Since there was n't any costeffective way to purify the air of shitdog stench , the olfactory psychophysiologists at Jolly Freeze R &D; had instead attacked the brain receptors involved in processing smells . The pills transformed human perception of the big stink . The smell was just as strong as ever , but nosegay users experienced it as sweet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the flood of smellstimuli had a mild hallucinogenic effect . Certainly Nguyen was acting odd . It was several hours before I was able to talk him out of smearing himself with his own ... but never mind . Although Wetherall 's avatar assured us that a simple dosage adjustment was all that was necessary , I was wary . Nguyen was not ; he could n't wait for the new improved batch . It was n't until I saw that he was able to control his stink tropisms that I was finally convinced to try the drug . I was impressed . Nosegays transformed the fetid air of the press encampment . And the intoxication induced by the lower dose was mild and actually quite pleasant . It made me feel at once silly and happy-like when I jumped on a bed . I missed jumping on the bed . It just was n't something you did in a lifthouse . NOT ONLY DID Wetherall 's money make unusual things happen , it made them happen fast . Just last week I 'd been worrying about my course load @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new art of shitdog management . Meanwhile , though I hardly had time to stop and marvel at it , plasticians were already assembling Wetherall 's house . While his avatars oversaw the project , the man himself stayed away . I had n't seen the real Wetherall since he left my hotel room at the Zones . I imagined him holed up in some Ramada Inn with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir . Maybe I 'm a naive academic , but I was surprised at the ferocity of people 's interest in what we were doing at Stateline . Sure , Wetherall 's business , O'Hara 's Laputa and the mystery of the shitdogs were each- to varying degrees  --  newsworthy in and of themselves , but the publicity surrounding the conjunction of all three was exponential . We always made the news ; often as not we were the lead story . And not just in Vegas or LA , but in Berlin and Djakarta ! Profit Week reported that shitdog castings would provide heretofore unimagined materials engineering applications , and that Wetherall would soon roll out a line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete with faked blueprints , which proved that Wetherall was building the lifthouse as a kind of degenerate love nest , where smelly and unspeakable sexual acts were to take place . No , said Channel Lore , the lifthouse was designed to be the most secure site on the planet ; mercenary shitdogs would act as Wetherall 's personal bodyguards against kidnappers and industrial saboteurs . On News Melt , Blaine Thorp claimed he 'd helped decipher the shitdog 's language and explained that Wetherall was moving into the lifthouse to conduct secret negotiations for the establishment of a space-based utopia . Eye offered this exclusive : Wetherall had devised a way to remove the jewels from the piles intact and had already contracted with Cartier 's to turn them into the world 's biggest necklace . Some insiders speculated he 'd offer it as an engagement present to Dawn Zoftiggle . But " inside " insiders revealed that Wetherall had fallen head over heels in love with a woman he 'd met while on location near the Stateline site . This mystery woman , it was said by those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I credited none of this , of course , except the part about the mystery woman , whom I took to be the bimbo at the motel . But the volume and audacity of the false reports boded ill for his hopes of privacy , once the lifthouse was completed . Meanwhile , Wetherall 's avatars gave cheery and innocuous interviews to whomever would listen . Only no one seemed to believe anything they said . Instead , commentators read sinister meaning into their PR platitudes . Whenever he was n't working on the project , Nguyen would personally lead reporters through Laputa . He was very disciplined in his approach : he would discuss himself , the lifthouse , the remoteness of the site , the problems of building around the shitdogs and then more about himself . He deflected questions he did n't want to answer with selfdeprecating humor , and was gentlemanly about keeping me out of the spotlight , making sure I knew when tours were scheduled so I could retreat to my room . When questions about the shitdogs came up , he transformed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts tell me that ... " or " I 've consulted my advisors on this .... " I was grateful for Nguyen 's discretion , because Wetherall had yet to deliver my avatar . Murk Janglish tried to explain it during one of his visits to Laputa . " Never seen anything like it , actually , " he said . " At first I thought it was your fault . Maybe you sabotaged the inventory or something , but the techs say no . There must have been some noise in the signal when your personality was scanned . " I was secretly gratified . I liked it that they were having troubles cramming me into their damned program . " I 'll be patient , " I said . " But I 'm not going public . Nguyen will just have to keep shielding me . " " Shielding you ? " said Janglish icily . " More like throwing himself at every camera he sees . " Nguyen smiled . " You 're getting so much publicity out of this , O'Hara , you ought to be paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what would my good friend Wetherall do with more money ? " he said , refilling Janglish 's champagne glass . " He has got far too much as it is . " Two days later Nguyen and I stood out on the salt flat , our noses filled with the fragrance of shitdogs digesting . It would have been delightful except for the late afternoon sun beating on us . We were waiting for the driver of the prototype mobile base that the Jolly Freeze engineers had thrown together . I had ordered a test run to see how the dogs would react . At the moment they lay pulsing , looking as oblivious and lazy as ever . They were n't , of course . Things were changing . I 'd spent the last two days confirming my discovery , and calculating the rate of change . I was trying to decide how much to reveal  --  because here I was , Wetherall 's magnificently paid shitdog expert , the rational scientist who had replaced mooncalf Thorp - and I did n't know what it meant . But then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The shitdogs are eating and excreting faster , " I blurted out . " The third pile here is accumulating at almost twice the rate of the first two . " " Hmmm , " said Nguyen . " Could it be that they 're adjusting to Earth conditions  --  getting better at whatever it is they do ? " " They 're showing no comparable changes at any of the other sites , " I said . " I checked the international database earlier today . " " Maybe it 's a response to our activities , " said Nguyen . " That 's my guess , but do n't quote me . " " Which activities ? Our construction is taking place far from them . We 're observing them , but they 've been observed before . " I shrugged . " I do n't know how this will affect the project , " I said , " but it does represent an advance in shitdog studies . For the first time we can be certain that the piles are a product rather than a byproduct . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " their rate would n't change . The fact that they 've speeded up confirms that it 's production . " " They feel acknowledged , perhaps , " said Nguyen playfully . " They wish to encourage art appreciation . Fair enough . More jewels to look at . But if this news gets out , it 's going to attract even more attention . " " It 'll get out eventually , " I said . " Exobiologists will take notice ; shitdog behavior does n't change often . And it is n't happening at the other sites . " " Hmmm , " said Nguyen . " Maybe we should build lifthouses at all the other sites too . Then Stateline would n't be so distinctive . " " I 'd appreciate it if you did n't tell this to Wetherall until I 've figured out the implications . " I did n't tell Nguyen my suspicion that the configuration of the piles and jewels might have some semiotic significance . Aunt Lindsay had done her dissertation on how the shape of African termite mounds was evolutionarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it appeared , shitdog behavior could respond to that of humans , then that suggested the possibility of a feedback loop - shitdog behavior influencing humans , who then influenced the shitdogs . A kind of subliminal , semiotic communication . But this notion was so Thorplike I did not want to have to admit to it until I understood more . Nguyen was gazing up at pile C. He turned and winked , as if letting me in on a joke . Only I did n't get it . Not all signs are so easily read . The base rolled up and stopped , clicking in the heat . The driver was dressed entirely in denim , his red-bearded face shadowed by a hat the size of a manhole cover . He motioned for us to enter ; the cab had been fitted with first class airline seats . Nguyen climbed in first . When the driver reached out to help me up , his grip , cool as a Billy Bar , made me do a double take . It was Wetherall . " Great to see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashed through the fake whiskers . There was no apology for humiliating me outside the Jolly Freeze van . Nguyen took it in stride . " So I take it you 've gotten yourself instructed on how to drive this from the crew . " " I arranged a private tutorial . " " You might at least have let us know in advance , " I said . " Then Janglish would 've had to be here to make sure I did n't have any unscheduled fun . " " Oh , Murk 's not that bad , " Nguyen murmured , " for a stone-hearted workaholic . You took a nosegay ? We 'll be parking right next to Stink Central . " Wetherall slipped into the driver 's seat in front of us and strapped himself in . " About twenty minutes ago . When I was a kid I used to grow orchids . I had this one cattleya , Bealls Red . It was dark as blood and had a fragrance big enough to fill a room . " He took a deep breath . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaned back in his seat , eyes glazing momentarily at the memory . " The nosegays are an extraordinary accomplishment . A shame we have to hold them off the market . " " You 're not going to sell them ? " I said . " But think of the applications . " Wetherall punched the code that started up the turbine . " Liz , the big stink is my fence ; it 's how I 'm going to keep the world out . Why would I pull that fence down after I 've gone to all this trouble to acquire it ? " The arrogance of the man made me momentarily dizzy . Or maybe it was the swelter in the cab . I could feel sweat tickle down my side . " Does n't that beard make you warm , Wetherall ? " I said . " I thought you liked life on ice . " " It is a little close in here . " Nguyen swabbed his forehead with a butter-colored handkerchief . " Oh , my clothes are air-conditioned , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wetherall , Nguyen and I giggled like kids as the shitdog chased us . Of course , Wetherall 's nosegays had something to do with our delight . We sat strapped into seats underneath a nuglas bubble . The base roared across the salt flat on its six treads , kicking up scuffs of salt and sand and scraps of the low , dry junipers that grew here and there in the basin . We were headed away from the Stateline A pile ; the shitdog galloped in its ungainly way behind us like a nightmare rocking horse . As we drove , we fired a simulation tracking beam up at a helicopter that was standing in for Wetherall 's future house . So far , so good - no matter our position or speed , the beam remained unbroken . Our initial approach had n't aroused their interest . They ignored us as we zoomed around the pile , and they ignored us when we idled a few yards away from them . They had n't even sniffed at the mobile base , let alone nibbled . That was when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alongside one he opened the window , leaned out , swung four big loops and let it fly . The running noose slithered over the shitdog 's head . Wetherall tied the end to the armrest on the door and then stomped on the brakes . We lost the door but had finally provoked one into chasing us . It smelled like heaven 's own bakery . " Chocolate-covered raspberries ! " shouted Wetherall . " Bittersweet chocolate , I mean . " " Chai tea , with plenty of honey and buttermilk , " corrected Nguyen . " And perhaps a crumb of pistachio baklava , too . " Myself , I kept catching smell-glimpses of Billybars and Charley Chuncolate Cones . Why should activating my odor-pleasure centers recall Jolly Freeze products ? Those were Wetherall 's positive smell associations , not mine . " Liz . " Wetherall touched my wrist . " Do you think it 's angry at us ? " I turned to the beast that galumphed patiently after us . " Who can say ? We 've hardly worked out their vocabulary of expressions  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't have any . It certainly seems more sporting than angry , though . Would n't you agree ? " " Yes , " said Wetherall . " Though I could be projecting . That is to say , sporting is the perfect word for how I feel . Our mobile base is going to work just fine , is n't it ? " " All the data is not yet in , " Nguyen said . He glanced at me significantly . I guessed he was waiting for me to mention the changes I 'd observed . " Remember , the real base is going to be towing a house six times the mass of Laputa . That will reduce maneuverability significantly . " " Nevertheless - " As they debated , it occurred to me that we 'd stumbled onto something that would make a tourist attraction if the word got out - shitdogwrangling . The nosegays added a certain essential elan to it all . I was sure a lot of people would pay handsomely for the fun we were having . The tickets we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wetherall 's deep pockets and craving for privacy , I doubted whether anyone but he would ever sample this novelty . That night , Wetherall stayed with us for the first time . Nguyen had Laputa towed to where Wetherall 's lifthouse was under construction . Since this site was almost three kilometers closer to the piles , we had to double our dosage of nosegays to cope with the big stink . Over dinner , Wetherall was talkative and charming , Nguyen was taciturn . Finally he spoke . " Perhaps it 's time to name your house , Wetherall ? " " How about Queen Jolly Freeze ? " I said . " Pretend it 's just a floating ice cream truck . That way no one will guess it 's where you live . " This time I wanted Nguyen to turn and wink , laugh with me at this ludicrous man . But he ignored me . Wetherall was busy fantasizing about his house . " When we run the first test , I want to be on board , " he said . " Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the viewing room . If we need to make any adjustments , I want them done as soon as possible . " " You sure you can steel yourself to look down from such a height ? " said Nguyen . " At least there , I 'll have something worth looking at . " " All right , " sighed Nguyen . " I suppose it 's time I see these jewels for myself . " Wetherall looked shocked . " You have n't seen them yet ! " " I 've been busy , " Nguyen said . " Other matters required my attention . " " My god , Nguyen , " said Wetherall . " The jewels are what this is all about . " " For you . " He sighed . " Oh , I 've looked at pixes . They 're admirable . " " You may not be the sort of person they are designed for , " I said . Wetherall picked up on that instantly . " What do you mean ? " I did not want to spill the beans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the jewels seem to fascinate some people more than others . " " Like Wetherall and you ? " Nguyen said . " And Thorp , " Wetherall added . I laughed . " Let 's leave him out of this . " " Why did you call them shitdogs , Liz ? " Nguyen asked . " Are n't you embarrassed to be studying something called a shitdog ? " " The Marines named them . Nobody asked me , " I said . It was a sore subject , so I changed it . " What about that name for your house ? " " If that 's what you want , " said Wetherall . " Queen Jolly Freeze will do nicely . " As dinner went on , Nguyen became increasingly quiet . He had n't been eating well of late , he told us , because everything tasted like boiled potatoes . " It 's true , " said Wetherall , digging a spoon into a melting scoop of Mintastic . " Even my private blend of Jolly Freeze has clearly suffered flavor degradation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry , your taste buds will bloom again , Nguyen . Besides , it 's a small price to pay for the jewels - and all this emptiness . " " As rewarding as this project has been , " said Nguyen wearily , " I begin to look forward to its completion . " At that , I felt a vague dismay . Without noticing , I 'd gotten used to Nguyen O'Hara 's company , his dark , ironic presence . He stood abruptly , muttered something about running some simulations and was gone before either of us could protest . Wetherall and I looked at each other across the table , then I glanced quickly down at my plate . Being stranded for the evening with the Emperor of Ice Cream was not what I 'd had in mind . WETHERALL AND I descended from the lifthouse and crossed the flat , our shoes crunching the packed salt . The temperature must have dropped thirty degrees - it was Wetherall weather . Tonight the extra dose of nosegays made the big stink smell like the fruitcake cookies Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pile A was a dark silhouette against the star-filled sky . The outcropping of jewels glinted at the top . One of the shitdogs circled the base , and in the distance I saw another lumbering toward the mountains . I still was n't sure why I 'd agreed to leave Laputa for some after-dinner jewel-viewing . Perhaps I did n't want to admit how much Nguyen 's abrupt departure had dashed some obscure hopes in me . At least in the dark I did n't have to look at Wetherall looking at me . I stopped to glance up . There were billions of stars , one for every dollar of Wetherall 's hideous fortune . The Milky Way flowed like a silver river across the sky . Off in the distance , the Pile A jewel outcropping gave off minor reflections in a hundred colors . I felt small . " It 's a big universe , " said Wetherall . " One time my mother and I we were living in Telluride , I must 've been ten or eleven . The sky was full of stars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - they were here a million years ago and they 'll be here a million years from now . " He looked up into the night . I caught his scent as I walked beside him . He smelled like tears . I felt sorry for him . Damn those nosegays-what I wanted to feel was irritation . I wanted to tell him , of course you 're mortal , bud . What you 're talking about is the human condition , not some problem only you have . I did n't say anything . After a moment he spoke again . " So where did the shitdogs come from , Liz ? " " Howard at Cambridge speculates they come from a planet orbiting a star of spectral type B. He bases this on their skin color , and that third eyelid they have . " " That 's a pretty elaborate structure to build on a foundation of air . " " You should know about building structures on air . " He laughed . His face was a white smear in the darkness , his eyes two shadows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart was racing . He leaned forward , then suddenly pointed over my shoulder . " Damn media leeches ! Quick , follow me . " I turned and saw jeep lights sweeping by . Before I could say a word Wetherall dashed off toward a pile of rubble a few hundred meters away . I stayed put and watched the jeep pull up to Laputa 's stairs . Murk langlish got out and took the steps two at a time . I went to tell Wetherall . The debris was tailings piled up at the entrance to a shitdog tunnel . The hole gaped black as a tar pit , six meters across . I could n't find Wetherall among the heaps of salt and rock . " Oh mogul ! " I called . " Here mogul , mogul , mogul . There 's a good mogul . " " Shhhhh ! " he hissed . His arm appeared from behind one of the nearer piles , waving me toward him . " They 'll hear you . " " Do n't worry . It 's only your lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here at this time of night ? " " Subpoenaing snakes ? How should I know ? " " Come here for a second . " He was standing at the edge of the tunnel . " How deep do you suppose this thing goes ? " " You 've read my reports . We 've sent drones down as far as six kilometers , but there 's no reason the dogs ca n't go deeper . For all we know they cruise the mantle . " Wetherall tossed a pebble into the pit . It was a long few seconds before it hit and rattled . " And what are the chances a shitdog is going to pop out of this hole and eat us ? " " The shitdogs do n't inhabit these tunnels , and do n't revisit them after they 've dug them . The average length of a tunnel is six point three kilometers , average depth two point five . The walls are covered with excreta chemically similar to the pile excretions , which forms a mastic to reinforce the tunnel against .... What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the darkness . " You are so serious about your work . " It was past time to tell him about the change in the shitdogs " behavior . I evaded . " At least I care about something besides money . " " Money ? Me ? You 've got the wrong idea about me , Liz . I 'm just the goose that lays the golden eggs . I do n't bother with what happens afterward . It 's people like Murk who sit on the nest . " " Watch out - you might trip over that metaphor . " I turned and started walking away . " I did n't mean to make fun of you . " He caught up to me . " Nguyen 's right about us being alike , you know . When I look at you I see myself with an academic veneer . Those jewels speak to me , Liz , in a way nothing else ever has . The problem is that I do n't understand them-yet . I do n't expect that the jewels are going to hand me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get away from him , but he matched my stride . " I 'm not even sure that once I do understand them , I 'll be able to explain . But I am certain I 'll be surprised . " He got in front of me , made me stop . " I like being surprised , " he said . " You surprise me . " " Right , " I said . " And I did n't even sign the waiver . " He shook his head . " There are n't many people as strong as you are , " he said . " Two hundred and thirty-eight billion dollars is like a black hole . It can crush the life out of everything that comes near it . " Me , strong ? I had some trouble catching my breath . I thought I knew what was coming next , and I was n't sure I wanted to hear it . " What do you think of me , Liz ? " " I do n't know , " I lied . " I think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " A part of me wanted him to like me . And I did n't want to hurt his feelings . Then I remembered the way he 'd brushed me off for some bimbo in a motel room . Maybe it was the wine , the night , his self-absorption , but I could n't take it anymore . " I do n't understand you , Wetherall . Good or bad ? I suppose it would n't be so bad if you would grow up and do something with your money . But what do you do ? You buy a company so you can eat ice cream all day long . You hide behind avatars . You wear disguises . You play with your lasso . You sleep with supermodels . You hire people so that you can deal with them only on your own terms . You build a huge toy house , float it someplace as far away from human contact as you can manage , take drugs to scramble your senses so you can ignore the stink of the pile of shit you 're hovering above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best you can come up with ? " Wetherall did n't say anything . The silence stretched . Suddenly I wished he 'd get mad , tear into me , tell me off for my perpetual smart mouth . He just stood there . " Let 's go back , " he said . " I 'm tired . " I felt as churned up as if he 'd assaulted me . " I 'm sorry , " I said . " I do n't know what 's gotten into me tonight . " " Too many nosegays . " " Maybe . I 've said too much . " We walked in silence back to Laputa . Later , I lay awake trying to figure out why I had unloaded on him so mercilessly . The next morning Wetherall was gone . No farewells , no nothing . His avatars called several times in the days that followed , but none of them brought up our starlight stroll in the desert . I tried to justify what I had said - he had asked me , had n't he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the three dark shitpiles on the white Stateline salt flats struck some obscure chord in my mind . I ran schematics of all five shitdog sites through my computer , trying to isolate some algorithm common to all of them . Surely all this was not without some meaning . Meantime , construction on Queen Jolly Freeze continued . Three or four nights later , I was staring in a trance at recent pix of the Pile A jewel cluster when Nguyen stopped by my room . " Knock , knock , " he said , standing in my doorway . He had a winebell of Pommery &; Greno tucked under an arm , two glasses in hand . " If this is a joke , " I said , " go away . If not , come in and open that . " He set the glasses on my desk . Self-conscious about my woolgathering , I touched a key and the image on the screen was replaced by a graph of pile growth rates at each of the five shitdog sites . Stateline had shot well into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't reported the change to Wetherall . But he did n't speak of it . " Have you noticed what nosegays do to champagne ? " He opened it and filled my glass halfway , finishing with an absurd flourish . I took the glass from him . " What does it smell like to you ? " he said . I sniffed . " Shoe polish ? " " Not unpleasant , but probably not worth sixty dollars a bell either . " He shrugged . " Smell is not something many architects bother with , you know . It 's hard to design for , though every building has its own peculiar odor . A castle smells different from a grass shack . Laputa smells nothing like Monticello . I have a colleague , Utrini , who installs olfactors in every room that he builds . He claims a scent palette in the thousands . " Nguyen paused . " What do we smell like to them ? " He gestured out the window . " The shitdogs ? " " I do n't know that they have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they do , the fact that they 've created such an intense odor source and stay so close to it is suggestive . " " Maybe they think we stink ? " I touched my glass to his . " One man 's champagne is another man 's cod liver oil . " His grin was fleeting . " We 're uncomfortable with scent , " he said , " because it reminds us that we 're animals . That 's why we tend to repress all but a few more or less pleasant aromas . We do n't like to admit how powerful smell is in our lives . " He fell silent for a moment , considering . I refilled his glass . " I 've spent more time thinking about smell in past few days than I have my entire life . " I wondered if he were flirting with me . " What 's this all about , Nguyen ? " He gave me an odd , detached smile . " Have you considered the potential of nosegays as an aphrodisiac ? " " Now you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All those bubbles in the champagne . " You should n't believe everything you see on America , America . You 've met the man . Did he strike you as any kind of ladykiller ? " " No , " I said , " but then , we have no interest in each other . " " Ah , but that 's my point exactly . For instance , I have no romantic intentions toward you , Liz . Whatsoever . " " You say the sweetest things , Nguyen . " " I 'm not trying to insult you , " he said . " I think you 're charming and intelligent . I hope that I 've earned some small measure of your friendship . But without going into grisly details , let 's just say that you 're not my type . " " I see . And why is it important I know this all of a sudden ? " Nguyen tugged at the cuff of his shirt . " I 'm finding that nosegays stimulate my libido in a very unwelcome way . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't control . But every so often when I catch your scent I feel ... eroticized . Very unprofessional , but there it is . I just wanted you to know why , the other night at dinner , I had to leave so abruptly , for example . I would n't want you to think I was being rude . " I knew now my cheeks were burning . " And you think this has something to do with nosegays ? " He nodded . " I 'm quite sure . I take it you have n't noticed any similar reactions ? " I shook my head . " Then you are lucky . " Again he raised his eyebrow , as if I was n't quite getting the message . " Or perhaps it is only the male of the species . " " What if I switched soaps ? " I said . " Or tried some kind of perfume ? Would that help ? " " No , " he said wistfully . " I believe that would make it worse . " Nguyen left half a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without really intending to . I was dumbfounded by his confession . I turned it over and over , like a chipmunk with a long , lost acom . Was it a come-on ? Finally I reached for the phone and punched in a call to Wisconsin . Aunt Lindsay answered . Her hair was done up in orange cornrows -a new style for her , but then she changed styles just about every other semester . " Liz ! " she said . " I 'm so glad you called ! Send me some money . " " You may think that 's a joke , Aunt Lindsay , but he 's paying me enough that I could buy your house . " " You could n't afford the waterproofing . " She peered into the camera . " What 's the matter , dear ? " I told her all about Wetherall , the walk on the salt flats , my fit of brutal honesty at the moment he 'd expressed a liking for me . And then Nguyen 's bizarre revelation . " How could Nguyen be well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not even remotely close to his ? I drive one man away from me in terror while the other fights manfully to master his perverse attraction to me . What 's wrong with me ? " " Absolutely nothing . " " But what does Nguyen mean when he says he feels " eroticized ' ? What grisly details ? When he looks at me it 's like my recurring nightmare where I walk into class naked and have to teach Kardashev 's system for classifying extraterrestrials to hormone-soaked college boys . " " There is no other sort of college boy . Listen , does this Mr. O'Hara cross his legs when he 's sitting near you ? Does he stand with his torso canted forward at an angle of four to seven degrees ? " " I have no idea , " I told her . " How about the billionaire ? " " He seldom sits still long enough for me to analyze his kinesics . " " Maybe you should try . You seem confused about him . " " He 's a confusing person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart lasso on you , did he ? Sometimes those rope boys do n't know when to stop . " " Aunt Lindsay , please . I do n't know why I got myself mixed up in this ! My life was predictable . I was a respected professional in a stable environment . Now I 'm on the net with madmen like Thorp , chasing lunatics like Wetherall across the salt flats , playing guessing games with egomaniacs like O'Hara . I 've got a doctorate in exobiology ! " " You 've always put too much store in the Ph.D. , Elizabeth . That skanky Dr. Matthewson from your department called here the other day , asking odd questions about the sofa in the faculty lounge . Is that really the " stable environment " you 're interested in ? You 've been in universities long enough to recognize that ninety percent of everything is bullshit . " Piled higher and deeper . " " I guess I should have known better than to seek my aunt 's opinion on normal behavior . " But what should I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are getting enough antioxidants , " Aunt Lindsay said , " you should do your best to enjoy every minute of it . " IT WAS STILL DARK when Nguyen woke me by pounding on my door . My head was pounding , too . " Murk wants to speak with you . He 's very upset . Wetherall is missing . " " Nguyen , it 's five-thirty-three in the morning . " " Please , Liz . He 's suffering . " I stumbled out to the lounge vid center . Despite the early hour , Janglish was already in his power suit . He looked as if his collar were strangling him . " Cobble , what the hell have you done with Ramsdel Wetherall ? " " That 's Dr. Cobble . And I have n't done a damn thing with him . " " Not for lack of trying . The naive act is n't going to fool me , Cobble . You were pretty slick about dodging the waiver . But just because you did n't sign does n't mean you can sink your hooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You know he was never at that hotel . He was just using the room to forward his messages . I began to get suspicious when it was always an avatar that answered whenever I called him there . Couple that with several reckless remarks he made about you , and I realized you must have him . I want him back now , do you hear me ? " " I believe they can hear you in Stuttgart , Mr. Janglish . " " Murk , " Nguyen broke in , " you 're way out of line , even for you . We have n't seen Wetherall since he left after the mobile base test . He has n't made it out to the site in days . And Liz has been here all along-I would certainly have noticed if she had been sneaking off to cavort with the boss . " " You 're vouching for her , Nguyen ? " sniffed Janglish . " Why yes , I suppose I am . " Out of range of the camera he drew a one with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only slightly mollified . " Well , then okay . For now . But I want you both to start looking for him . Give it your highest priority . Your project has got him neglecting his real responsibilities . There are ten transnational enterprises dependent on his input . I 'm holding you responsible for distracting him . And if I find out that you 've seen him and then let him get away , I 'll make you sorry you ever heard the name Murk Janglish . " " I already am , " I muttered . " Now , Murk , " said Nguyen , " you really ought to calm down . Wetherall is a slippery devil . Trying to catch him will only raise your blood pressure . " Janglish glared back at Nguyen . " It 's already a hundred and eighty over ninety , and I do n't think you 've helped it one bit . " Then the screen went black . " I believe I enjoy a special rapport with that man , " Nguyen mused . " What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I asked . " What reckless remarks ? " Nguyen squinted out the window at the spectacular sunrise over the Wasatch Mountains . The shadow of Pile C pointed toward Laputa like an accusing finger . " I 'll try the construction base , " he said . " Maybe he has some hiding place I 've missed . " " I 'm going to take a Serentol , " I said , and headed for the bathroom . I donned one of Nguyen 's staff uniforms , took a jeep , and headed across the flats toward the press encampment . The place seemed unusually busy for seven in the morning , but then , reporters on assignment do n't sleep much . I ignored the swarm headed for the press tent , parked the jeep near a sol-power unit and prowled down the aisles of trucks , vans , and satellite uplinks . Nests of fiberoptic cables sprawled across the scuffed salt . Finally I found what I was looking for . The Jolly Freeze van was parked near the edge of the camp . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and kicked at the door . Not only did it feel great , but I believe I may have dented it . " Wetherall ! " I shouted . " Come out of there , you weasel ! " The door opened . Wetherall leaned out , grabbed me by the wrist , and yanked me in . " Thank God you 're here , Liz . " Unlike the van he had used to pick me up at the university , this one was outfitted as a camper . There was a teak bunk , a teak drop table , a compact but sophisticated media center , galley , head . Three smart lassos lay coiled under the bunk . On the pix was the Queen Jolly Freeze construction site . The exterior of the house was completed , and workmen were entering and exiting through the balcony entrance . " You 've been here all along , have n't you ? Even that night when I was outside this van trying to talk to you , you were here , not in any hotel . " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Did you even have a woman in here with you , or did you just invent her to make me feel used ? " " That was n't why I invented her , Liz . I just wanted to keep away from Murk . " " Right in the middle of the biggest army of reporters in the country ? " " The Purloined Letter dodge . I 'm sorry I deceived you . " " You 're not forgiven . Do you know that Janglish has accused me of stealing you away from your " responsibilities ' ? " " Murk has a different view of my responsibilities than I have . He figures if he controls the women I see , then he controls me . " " Has it occurred to you that I do n't give a damn about your women ? " I was so angry at the man that I felt as if I had stepped aside from myself . What I did next shocked me . " Look , I 've had enough of this . I quit . Hire Thorp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the van . I tried to slam the door behind me , but Wetherall caught it . " Liz , " he protested . " Please do n't go . " I stormed down the aisle of vehicles , Wetherall following me , begging me to listen to him . There was some commotion in the press camp . Reporters were milling around the main tent , trailing cameras and cable . No one noticed Wetherall , even though he was n't wearing a silly hat or a phony beard . I spotted Nguyen about the same time as he saw me and made a broad pointing gesture toward Wetherall . I 've got him , I mouthed . You take him , I thought . Nguyen bumped his way over to us . There was salt dust on his buttercolored suit . His eyes were wide with excitement . " Big doings , " he said . " You have to see this . " " Why ? " I said . Without replying , he ushered us over to the tent and picked up the edge where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through . Blaine Thorp was giving a press conference , only the sound system was so loud that I could n't understand what he was saying . I heard him bellow the word " convergence . " Nguyen pushed into the crowd to get a better look ; I grabbed Wetherall by the sleeve and tugged him into the back corner of the tent , behind some sound equipment . Wetherall looked hunted . He was surrounded by reporters , the enemy , breathing the same sweltering air that they breathed . I had never seen him sweat until that moment . I do n't think it was because the air-conditioning in his shirt had failed . Convergence . Earlier in the day , it had been reported , the shitdogs in all four of the other sites had ducked their noses and begun digging . Every shitdog on the planet besides ours here at Stateline had simultaneously disappeared under the crust of the desert . When it became apparent that the shitdogs were n't resurfacing , robot probes were sent in after them , to track their movements , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any direction to it . There was . All four sets of shitdogs were tunneling in a straight line directly for Nevada . They were closing ranks , and Stateline had been declared base . Somebody adjusted Thorp 's microphone . " That 's precisely what I 'm saying , Darla , " he told a reporter in the first row . " The Atacama Desert , the Gobi Desert , Ethiopia 's Danakil Plain , and Lake Disappointment in Australia are all about eight thousand statute miles , as the crow flies , from Stateline . As the mole burrows , that 's a little over seven thousand miles . Assuming the shitdogs can burrow at a top speed of eight miles per hour , they 'll be here in fifteen days . " " That ca n't be right , " I said to Wetherall . " He 's got the math wrong . " " So what happens when they get here ? " Someone shouted a follow-up . " Nothing right away , I hope . But that depends on stopping any further disturbance of the shitdogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the advance wave for the race of aliens who sent them . Call these aliens the " Big Dogs . " The casting piles are the power sources and the jewels the beacons . What we have here is an attractive nuisance set up by these superminds . A fire alarm . If we mess with it , thereby showing our intelligence , we set off the alarm . And Ramsdel Wetherall , with his construction activity , his wrong-headed advice from the academic establishment , and his obsession with the jewels , is intent on giving us away . Does he realize this ? Of course he does ! How could he not ? It 's common knowledge that pile C here in Stateline has been growing at an alarming rate , while there has been no change at any of the other sites . He 's tripped the alarm , and wants to bring the Big Dogs down . That 's the reason we 've got convergence , and that 's why we 've got to stop him . " I could n't stand it anymore . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tried to pull me back , but it was like facing Matthewson at a Curriculum Committee meeting . " What a load of unfounded bullshit ! " I shouted . In the corner of my eye I saw Nguyen slip out of the tent . Thorp squinted until he made me out against the lights . " Dr. Cobble ? I 'm glad you deigned to show up . You have a better explanation ? " " What is this theory based on , other than your Ouija board ? It sounds like the plot of some pre-millennial sci-fi movie . I 've known about the growth in pile C for weeks , and you just figured it out ! " The reporters turned , Wetherall clutched at my arm , and I realized that once again my passion had carried me a little past the bounds of discretion . " Oops , " I whispered . " Let 's get out of here , " Wetherall muttered . We made a dash for the outside . When the reporters realized the man next to me was Wetherall , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could leap into Nguyen 's jeep . As we sped across the flats toward Laputa , Nguyen spoke to Wetherall . " I believe we are faced with a moment of truth . " On the ride back , I sat beside Wetherall and tried to melt into a puddle so I could soak though the floorboards into the salt flat . I should have told him about pile C days ago . He knew I knew . I knew he knew . Now Thorp was villifying us both , and I 'd handed him the means to do it . Wetherall spoke first . " We 've got to hurry up the launch . " " Listen , " I said . " I screwed up . I let Thorp scoop me on the big story . But that does n't justify all that garbage he 's dumping on us . Do n't let him force our hand . " " The shitdogs have forced our hand , Liz , " said Wetherall , his voice flat . I tried to read him , but could n't . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to lop off my head for what I had or rather , had n't - done . But why was I worried that he might fire me ? I had just quit . By the time we reached Laputa , Wetherall was already planning his counter-strike . He would hold a press conference of his own , float a raft of different but eminently plausible explanations of the shitdogs " behavior to defuse any panic Thorp might have aroused . " Thorp 's not a credible scientist , " I protested . " We do n't need to respond . " " We ? " said Wetherall . " So we 're " we " again ? " " I 'm sorry , Wetherall , " I said . " For everything . How about a deal ? If you do n't fire me , I wo n't quit . " Nguyen 's eyebrows arched but he said nothing . Neither did Wetherall . He simply offered me his hand and we shook . His hands were warmer than I remembered . He did n't seem angry or disappointed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then we can proceed immediately . You 'll speak for us , Liz . You carry more weight than Thorp . You can make him look like the eccentric he is . " A lot Wetherall knew about eccentrics . " But I ca n't face down an army of reporters . They 'll nibble me to death . " " You do n't have to , " said Wetherall . " Your avatar is ready . She can do it . " I sat with Nguyen in Laputa 's media room to watch the press conference . Wetherall was holed up in his room . On the pix , it looked just like a live press conference . Behind the microphones were Wetherall and I - or rather our avatars . Wetherall 's was the accustomed grinning , overenthusiastic barrel-of-quirks . I 'd thought his avatars exaggerated until I met the man and learned they were actually realistic . Mine was good . I could n't complain about that . The avatar-modeling program had caught my edges , my impatience and sarcasm . Although I had never smiled that much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to oatmeal . There was only one problem . " Cobble " and " Wetherall " were standing too close together . It looked like their hips were touching behind the podium . And they were flirting , bantering like teenagers , much to the detriment of the spin they were trying to sell . They positively glowed . I could see tomorrow 's gossip columns as clearly as if they were etched in the air before me . I opened the interface Wetherall had given me to move " Cobble " to a polite distance , only then she lost the train of her thought . If I was going to take control of my avatar , it seemed that I would have to do all the talking . I could n't . I ran up one level and pounded on Wetherall 's door . I was doing a lot of that lately . The door opened . " Hello , Liz - " " I thought " Let's-not-and-say-we-did " was supposed to be a mutual decision , " I said . " Eh ? " There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Who is it , Ramsdel ? Not that Cobble woman again ? " " You 're not watching our press conference ? " I said . Wetherall shrugged , " I 've been too busy . Murk tells me that my money missed me while I was gone . Besides , we 're not really saying anything important , are we ? That 's the whole point of a press conference . " " Ramsdel , " said Janglish , " aim me at her . There 's something she needs to hear . " " We may not be saying anything , but our avatars are practically in each other 's pants , " I said . " Really ? " " Come down and take a look . " " Ramsdel ! " shouted Janglish . " Wait , Ramsdel . Do n't ... " " Hold that thought , " said Wetherall , and turned him off . Down in the media room , Nguyen had broken out the champagne . " This is really quite interesting , " he said . Wetherall watched for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sorry Liz , but I 'm not at all sure this is bad strategy . If our supposed " romance " becomes a story , then it will distract the reporters from Thorp . But if you want , I 'll call the team leader and get your avatar tweaked right away . " " Mine ? What about yours ? " From where I sat , it looked like " Wetherall " was trying to peek down " Cobble 's " blouse . - " If you insist , I can have my avatars adjusted as well . " " What good is that going to do ? The damage is done . The reporters are going to think I 'm your mystery woman . We 'll be the talk of the net tomorrow . " " They 've got me in bed with any woman who gets within ten kilometers . I 'm sorry - I 'm used to it . Maybe I should n't be . But I 'll do what I can to spare you the indignity of being thought of as romantically linked to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having apoplexy . " Nguyen watched him leave with a detached air of amusement . I turned on him . " What 's that smirk about . You look like you 're hatching an egg . " " He likes you , Liz . " " Right . " " Liz , when avatars are well done - and remember , it took some time to get yours exact-they 're more than just mirrors or puppets . They 're out there doing what people are normally too busy to do anymore  --  playing . Experimenting with possibilities . So these two fell in lust with one another . You can ignore it completely , or you can take note of it - maybe your avatar is telling you something you ought to know . Personally , the chance that that might happen is what 's kept me from having one . I 'm sure there are some things about myself I would rather not discover . " He took another sip of champagne . " Now , assuming this press conference gets the reporters off our necks for a while , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to get Queen Jolly Freeze up and flying before the convergence happens . " On the pix , " Cobble " put her hand up to touch " Wetherall " on the arm . BY THE END of the day everybody in the world knew that the Chinese , Ethiopian , Chilean , and Aussie shitdogs were tunneling to Stateline . Seismologists rushed equipment to Nevada to try to anticipate their arrival . It was generally believed that Thorp 's estimate for a simultaneous arrival in fifteen days was ludicrous ; reasonable numbers ranged from twenty-one to thirty-five days . There were calls in Congress to ban everyone from Stateline except for military , but the governor of Nevada  --  whose hand was , no doubt , deep in Wetherall 's pocket - made a fiery speech about states " rights . The reporters vowed to stay right where they were to cover what many claimed was the biggest story in history . Perversely , Wetherall found himself allied with the media against the government in the effort to maintain civilian access to the shitdog site . Ten days after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for flight . There would be no test : this was the official launch even though the mobile base would n't be ready for another week . Wetherall had insisted , over Nguyen 's objections , that we use the makeshift base we had driven on our shitdog-wrangling test . Queen Jolly Freeze had to be up and running before the rest of the shitdogs arrived . " When you 're ready , Wetherall . " The pix softened Nguyen 's voice to a whisper . Overnight the crew had tested all systems and inflated the balloons with helium . In the dawn light , through the skylight , I had watched them swelling over us like huge tumors . Now Wetherall and I were in the control room of Queen Jolly Freeze . Below us , Nguyen in the base directed the ground crew as they worked the mooring lines that had kept the house stable through the inflation . Wetherall 's liftmansion was a brobdignagian version of Laputa , an elongated octagon rather than a disk , with four levels , an encircling balcony ( despite Wetherall 's acrophobia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot tub . Every room had its own escape hatch and ladder . Wetherall decided that none of the crew was necessary . He knew as much about his house as anyone . This was to be a test run for his elusive solitude as well as for Queen Jolly Freeze . I was surprised when he invited me along . Wetherall was as bright and excited as a kid with seventy million dollars worth of balloons . " I 'm going to retract the boom now , " he said . " Go , " Nguyen replied from the pix . The stair boom detached from the base and retracted into the house . The mooring lines fell away . There was an initial jerk as the lifthouse broke free and found its equilibrium . It hovered , neither rising nor falling , ten meters above the base . " Neutral ballast achieved , " Nguyen said . " Electromagnetic tether engaged . " " I 'm going to take it up to half altitude , " Wetherall said . His hands moved over the controls . Through the observation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wetherall stopped the house at sixty meters . In the light northerly breeze , it moved off thirty meters south of the base . The shadows of the big balloons , in the early morning light , were cast against the foot of Pile B a kilometer away . " Let 's have a look at the jewels , " Wetherall said . " Up there you see jewels , " Nguyen grumbled . " Down here all I see is shit . " He started the base crawling over the salt flats . As the wind was at its back , the house drifted into the lead . Wetherall peered intently at the piles ahead . I retreated to the observation deck on the opposite side of the house to watch for shitdogs . It was almost over now , and looking down from the balcony , I thought about what the last months had meant . Since that night on the salt flats , Wetherall had treated me with punctilious correctness , retreating into formality like a hurt child . I did n't know why that should have bothered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chilly outside , and the wind blew back my hopeless hair . Of course , the media had noticed the lifthouse taking off . They scrambled a dozen copters in pursuit . Wetherall 's private little launch party was going to be live on the net , very shortly . But I did n't have the chance to tell him . Below , a pair of shitdogs appeared , loping after the base . Nguyen began to turn away from them and the piles but then two more shitdogs approached from the west . Nguyen spotted them , sped up and veered back left . As he did , the left side treads of the base skipped a little ahead , spinning faster than the right ones , though the crawler did n't seem to speed up when it did . The mass of the house , in occasional gusts of wind , was threatening to pull the base off the salt flats . Nguyen had been right ; the base was n't massive enough for Queen Jolly Freeze . I wondered about the way the four shitdogs had come at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were acting in concert . But that did n't make sense , because the effect of their actions was not to chase us away but to steer us toward the piles . Just then I noticed a cloud of dust being kicked up off toward the press encampment . Several vehicles had crossed the property line and were closing on us . " Wetherall , we 've got company , " I said . " I know . There 's nothing I can do about the copters , but I 'm having security turn those buses around . " " They better . You realize that if we make any sudden turns , your house is going to yank the base off the ground like Piglet in a windstorm . " " What about that , Nguyen ? " He sounded calm . " I told you the mass of this base was inadequate . Of course , a collision with either a shitdog or a bus voids your warranty . However , the shitdogs seem to be dropping back . As long as the wind does n't pick up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathing , you two . " Copters hovered around Queen Jolly Freeze like gulls around a beached whale . I could see a commentator talking excitedly into his throat mike . I ran out to the rec room and turned on the pix . " ... Floating pleasure-palace drifts toward the largest of the alien piles ... " A telephoto close-up showed Wetherall at the controls ; it made him looked goofier than he really was . " ... identity of the woman is still unknown . We have unconfirmed reports that it 's pix flame Daphne Overdone , spirited away from the set of the interactive spectacular Madonna by special black operatives of Allweather Security , Wetherall 's Jolly Freeze subsidiary .... " " Whoa , Nguyen ! " said Wetherall . " This is close enough . " The base skidded slowly to a halt . I ran back to Wetherall . We floated alongside pile B. The air was thick with the smell of strawberries and chocolate . Outside the window of the observation deck , twenty meters away , were the jewels that crowned the shitpile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had decapitated Pile A four years ago . Since there 's no way to quantify beauty , scientists are supposed to ignore it . But the view of the jewels took my breath away . There were three main groups . Each consisted of hexagonal rhombohedrons , the largest over three meters in length and almost half a meter in diameter . But the surface of each of the larger jewels was fixed with a myriad of smaller rhombohedrons , and each of those with still smaller ones , in a kind of fractal dance . The colors ranged from the liquid red of garnet , through a fiery gold , to azure , tourmaline and indigo . The morning sunlight reflecting off and refracting through them threw a thousand brilliant highlights . " This is why I built this house , " Wetherall said quietly . " I 'm sorry I had to push you around to do it . " " They 're beautiful , " I said . Wetherall was silent for a long time . I sat beside him and the two of us watched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had any intelligible purpose at all , or were just some chance production of a heap of alien shit . It would be a good joke on all of us - but no more than the beauty of a spiral galaxy , or of the pattern of seeds in a sunflower . Was all this sound and fury , my career in the university , Thorp 's career in the media , Nguyen 's architectural commission and Wetherall 's billions put in service of it , justified by a calm ten minutes at the apex of Pile B ? In the end , Wetherall was a pretty sad character . And if he was sad , then what was I , with my academic infighting , the " shitdogs studies community " and coffee for Saintjohn Matthewson ? The light seemed to dance in the corner of my eye and I started to feel that odd feeling again , like I was standing next to myself . As I looked at Liz Cobble , I saw a woman who was very plain indeed  --  nobody special . It made me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brilliance I 'd been born with . I did not shine . Who would ever be dazzled by me ? Of course , I knew exactly when it had all begun . At the nurse 's station in the ICU of St. Anne 's hospital . The smiley nurse with the hair thick as rubber bands wanted to give me a lollipop . I did n't want a lollipop . I was eight years old and my mother was dying and I was going to have to live the rest of my life with my two aunts , who dressed strange and smelled funny and never had anything to eat in their house . " Here , take it honey , " the nurse said . It was purple . Of course she did n't know that I hated purple lollipops . " We only give them to special little girls . " " I do n't want to be special , " little Lizzy Cobble had said . " I want to go home . " She was such a stubborn little girl . " Liz , does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's words roused me from my orgy of self-reproach . At first I thought it was just the angle of the sun , then I realized that Wetherall was right . The jewels were beginning to glow . " Has anyone spotted this phenomenon before ? " Wetherall asked . " It 's not in the literature , " I said . " We need to get closer . This could be a breakthrough . " " You think it 's some sort of radioactivity ? " " I doubt it . There 's nothing in their chemical composition that ... " Nguyen interrupted us . " Wetherall , we 've got problems . " " What ? " Wetherall asked . " Actually at least a hundred problems . Thorp has come to visit with some friends . " I ran out to the balcony to see . One of the buses had gotten through and had pulled up beside the base . A crowd was boiling out . People threw themselves on the ground in front of the treads of the base . Thorp , wearing a severe black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bullhorn . When the base was surrounded on three sides he turned the horn up toward Queen Jolly Freeze . " WETHERALL ! " his amplified voice boomed . " MAKE THIS FOOL PULL YOUR HOUSE BACK FROM THE JEWELS . YOU DO N'T REALIZE THE DANGER YOU 'RE PUTTING US ALL IN - THE WHOLE HUMAN RACE ! YOU WERE CRAZY TO TRY TO REPLACE ME WITH THAT WOMAN - SHE DOES N'T KNOW A THING ABOUT THESE CREATURES . PULL BACK BEFORE IT 'S TOO LATE ! " Nguyen had climbed down from the cab of the base to argue with Thorp . He gesticulated wildly , pointing off across the flats where the fifth shitdog had joined its four fellows . They crouched all in a line ; I had never seen anything like it . Their pattern seemed deeply meaningful . The copters dropped down low . Their backwash jostled the Queen Jolly Freeze . I could see telephotos on Thorp . This was his moment in the sun ; I hoped the old loon was sweating . Wetherall switched on the house 's PA system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are trespassing on private property . Gather your people together and leave before we call in the authorities . " " YOU 'RE TOYING WITH DISASTER . ALREADY , BECAUSE OF YOUR ACTIVITIES , SHITDOGS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD ARE GATHERING HERE . NOW YOU 'RE GOING TO SET OFF THE BEACON , AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT THE BIG DOGS WILL BE HERE ! " I leaned over and grabbed the microphone . I decided not to mention anything about the jewels beginning to glow . " Thorp , you microcephalic poser ! What are you babbling about ? If you think - " " Liz , " said Wetherall . He pointed . Thorp , and Nguyen and the crowd of protesters all turned their heads in the same direction , as if they were connected to servos . The effect was impressive . Once they saw the five shitdogs that were marching in a line toward the base , however , the illusion of unity vanished . Nguyen dashed for the cab . A dozen protesters did the same , crowding in with him as Nguyen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't fit hung off the sides . But most of the others were still lying on the ground , and there was no room to maneuver . Thorp stood calmly in place while the panic-stricken swirled around him . He raised the bullhorn . " DO N'T WORRY . " His voice crackled . " THEY MEAN US NO HARM . THIS IS PART OF THE PLAN . " " What is he doing ? " I asked Wetherall . " I 'm going down there . " " With those lunatics ? No . Besides we 're too high . " " Then reel in the tether . I need to get down , Wetherall . Right now ! " " No , Liz . " I stared at him . Who did he think he was , telling me what to do ? I ran down to the bottom floor , overrode the locks and popped the hatch . Thanks to the breeze , the house was floating to the south of the base , and forty meters below lay the edge where the castings pile met the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the protesters boiled around the base truck most of them . Here and there in the crowd was one who stood stock still , like Thorp , as if dazed . I threw the emergency ladder over the edge and it unrolled to within a couple of meters of the ground . Close enough-I swung my legs over the edge , and , clutching the ladder white-knuckled , began to climb down . " Liz , no ! " I heard Wetherall shout from above me . Derring-do is harder in real life than in the gropies . Looking down made me want to throw up , so I did n't . I tried to fix on the horizon . The breeze caught the ladder and I began to describe a long , lazy ellipse approximately ten stories off the ground . Meanwhile , the shifting of my weight as I moved from rung to rung made the ladder twist . I began to wonder if maybe I was as crazy as Thorp . At least he had two feet on the ground . A copter came over to watch me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved a few meters and then jerked to a stop . I almost lost my grip . " Nice driving , Nguyen , " I muttered , and looked down . Only it was n't Nguyen driving at all . He had been thrown from the cab by protestors and was only now scrambling back on . Just in front of the base truck , a circle of the salt flat was boiling and churning . The center of the patch fell away , and a pair of blue legs poked out . It was a shitdog , hatching from the desert like a baby dinosaur . But that was impossible ; all five shitdogs were marching in formation on the stranded base . I froze on the ladder . I was suddenly dizzy , and it was n't only because I was doing a high wire act without a net . Another pair of claws burst through the salt crust , then another . All around the piles shitdogs erupted from the desert . Someone had forgotten to give them a copy of the schedule . Convergence was happening early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five shitdogs , but with twenty-five . Most of the protestors broke ranks now , scattering in every direction , throwing themselves onto the base , although quite a few still remained by Thorp 's side . The base was backing away , or attempting to , its treads spinning against the resistance of the massive lifthouse . The ladder twisted and jerked . I wrapped my legs around the rung and twisted my arms in the rope , clinging for my life like Dejah Thoris , six stories above an approaching horde of alien creatures that smelled like lilacs . But the thing that surprised me the most was that I wanted to climb down more than ever . It was as if the shitdogs were calling me . I wondered how long it would take before whoever was driving the base realized the only way they were going to get moving would be to kill the electro-magnetic tether . Not long at all . The house shot up about ten meters before it re-established neutral ballast . I yo-yoed beneath it on the ladder . We were drifting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shitdogs bellowed up at me , and radiated in toward the pile . " Hang on , Liz ! " Wetherall 's voice boomed from the house 's loudspeakers . I looked up and saw him out on the balcony . He had gotten out his smart lasso and was twirling it over his head , legs bent and braced . The jewels were glowing so brightly now that it was hard to look at them . In the shadow of the house 's roof , Wetherall 's face was awash in their light . He threw the lasso at the jewels and missed , falling short by a meter or two . The electric rope snapped itself upward and hovered in the air like a cobra , awaiting its next command . The wind was blowing us away from the shitpile . Wetherall tried again , and this time the lasso caught the jewels . He lashed the other end of the smart rope to the railing of the house , and dashed inside , to reappear at the open hatch . Wetherall gulped , then slid awkwardly over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the size of eggs . I could n't watch him watch the ground so I looked down again . All twenty-five shitdogs had formed two roughly concentric circles beneath me . A target . And they were calling to me . They wanted me , Liz Cobble , the queen of shitdog studies . " Liz , do n't move , " Wetherall called . " I 'm coming . " The only thought in my head was , he 's trying to stop me . I had to get away from him . I made myself move down the ladder . The base scuttled across the flats under a black swarm of protesters . Thorp 's bus was gone , leaving a score or more protesters behind , among them Thorp . One of the pix copter pilots , braver than the others , landed and waved to the stragglers to jump aboard . But they ignored him . Thorp turned the bullhorn on him . " THAT 'S OKAY . WE HAVE EVERYTHING UNDER CONTROL , " he said . Then he dropped the bullhorn at his feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I saw him brush a hand along an aquamarine-colored flank , and I was jealous . It was n't fair ! Heedless now of the risk of falling , I scrambled down . Wetherall was shouting at me . I do n't even know what he said . Thorp came to the center of the shitdog formation , held his arms out and turned around twice , as if to embrace them all . A shitdog approached him and then settled back on its haunches . He walked toward it , smiling . The jewels were glowing so furiously now that their prismatic colors rained down on the the shitdogs and Thorp 's followers like God 's own grace . My head swam with the scent of roses . God-damned Thorp ! Tears welled in my eyes . I had looked into the jewels " heart . The shitdogs had called to me . I was supposed to be special . I was about to let go of the ladder and drop to the ground when Wetherall reached me and seized my arm . The lead shitdog lifted up its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , claws sliding from its feet like those of a cat . The embrace took in Thorp , who stood , arms lifted . Clumsy as a baby , the shitdog grabbed Thorp between its paws , lifted him to its mouth and bit his head off . All I could think of was how lucky he was . Thorp 's followers were going where their leader had gone before them , falling into the eager embrace of the shitdogs , being torn to pieces and eaten . I struggled to get free of Wetherall , but he wrapped his legs around me and would not let me go . We twisted on the ladder . The wind bore the house around to the side of the castings pile , the ladder jerked downward , and Wetherall and I dropped the last few meters to the salt flats . I tried to get free of him , but was knocked dizzy by the fall . By the time I got my wind , the shitdogs were done feeding . The jewels stopped glowing . When I shook my head , little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't remember who I was or why I was there . I watched uncomprehendingly as the shitdogs settled down among the bloody scraps of Thorp 's followers and went to sleep . " Liz , are you okay ? " said Wetherall . The sound of my name snapped me back from wherever I had been . " Why ? Why did you stop me ? It was supposed to be me , not Thorp ! " " I love you , Liz . " I blinked at him , the goofy billionaire . Then I looked up at Queen Jolly Freeze . Wetherall was afraid of heights . How the hell had he climbed down that ladder ? ALTOGETHER , THE twenty-five shitdogs consumed twenty-five of Thorp 's people , twelve men and thirteen women . They then fell into a coma-like sleep . During the next forty-eight hours , the world watched as they shriveled and deflated . The Joint Chiefs advocated nuking them before they awoke . I was in the camp that said it would be a crime against the universe to destroy the aliens over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Thorp 's people were trespassing on private lands , had been warned of the dangers involved , and had voluntarily offered themselves for consumption . He never mentioned that I 'd been prepared to do the same , and I was grateful to him for keeping that quiet . About the time Wetherall and I were being picked up by Nguyen and Janglish , Wetherall 's smart rope lost power . Queen Jolly Freeze came unmoored , floated majestically across the flats before a stiff , hot breeze that smelled of fresh-baked oatmeal bread . Ten hours later it wrapped itself around Deseret Peak in the Stansbury Mountains of Utah and was totally destroyed . The debate about what to do about the dogs was still raging when , three days later , they awoke . The report that the shitdogs were stirring came while Wetherall , Nguyen , Janglish and I were sitting in the lounge of Laputa , going over the wreckage of Wetherall 's plans and trying to figure out what came next . Wetherall seemed surprisingly sanguine about the destruction of Queen Jolly Freeze . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't need it anymore.sE Nguyen and Janglish had established some sort of alliance aimed at getting Wetherall back to his business interests . And they were holding hands . They made a strange couple ; I wondered how they 'd fare once the nosegays wore off . In any event , I guess I 'd figured out the gory details of Nguyen O'Hara 's erotic life . Me , I was thinking about whether I could face going back to the university after everything that had happened . Back to bored undergrads and faculty meetings run by the likes of Saintjohn Matthewson . Much as I had complained , inwardly and outwardly , about the way Wetherall had deranged my life , I was n't sure I wanted it to be ranged again . Also , the shitdogs were the biggest news in the world of science since Playdough Theory . As the sapientologist with the most experience on the ground , so to speak , I was n't going to leave until I knew what was going on . " Let 's go , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their last interaction with humans , I 'm not sure I want to be there when they take up activities again , thank you . Besides , we have issues to resolve with Wetherall . " " That 's fine , " I said . " I do n't blame you . But I 'm a scientist . " " I 'm coming too , " Wetherall said . " There 's no need - " I started . " Considering your behavior during the last shitdog interaction with humans , I think there is , " Wetherall said . I did n't argue . We grabbed a jeep and motored over to Pile B. It was the first time we had been alone together since we 'd been picked up on the salt flats . I felt nervous , as if we were both expecting me to say something . I took my eyes off the horizon to look at him . He squinted against the bright sunlight , the wind blowing his hair . He looked his age , which I had discovered was forty-two . " The place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't care . " I concentrated on driving . Amid the talk that he was responsible for the death of Thorp 's followers , he had faced hordes of questioning reporters  --  without his avatars . " I have n't forgotten what you said when you stopped me from getting eaten , " I told him . " Please-I do n't expect you to say anything . You already told me how you feel about me . " " That was an example of the narcissism of minor differences . " " The what ? " " Never mind . Things change . " There were several seconds of silence . We were coming up on the cordon of weaponry and troop carriers the army had thrown up around the site . I kept my eyes on it , my heart thumping while I waited for Wetherall 's response . Finally I snuck a peek at him . He was looking right at me , wearing the same goofy , astonished smile his avatar had flashed during his first call to my university office . " Change is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud . " Ask Murk Janglish . " We reached the checkpoint . Wetherall had brought enough financial and political pressure to bear to insure us a hearing when the time came ; now I watched him discuss quietly with the nervous officer in charge why our presence - in particular mine - was appropriate at this crucial moment . Wetherall seemed quite as adept at persuasion in person as he was by avatar . We passed through the perimeter to the place where the sleeping dogs lay . In the days since what the press was calling the Big Thorp Massacre , the shitdogs had been undergoing some sort of transformation . They 'd exuded fluids , and lost a considerable portion of their mass . Some were of the opinion that human flesh was poisonous to them and the dogs were dying . I was n't convinced . The last confrontation had been so purposeful , on both sides . And I could not discount my own compulsion to converge . The dog that had eaten Thorp was the first to rise . After baking in the hot sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fours . Its legs had become more elongated and slender , and the paws more handlike , with three fingers and an opposable thumb . As it sat up , quivering , I saw that its neck was also longer , its brow higher . The soldiers drew back . There was a clank of weapons brought to the ready when the dog rose onto its hind legs . It shook its head , opened its eyes , then looked down at itself , and raised its big blue paw before its face . " My God ! " it said . " I 've got my hand back ! " The soldiers prepared to fire . Wetherall pulled me back . The creature lowered its hand and regarded us with a clear intelligence . " No need for the guns , boys , " it said . " Dr. Blaine Thorp here . Let me explain to you what 's going on . " The shitdogs were biological message devices . They were sent by an alien race which the Thorp-creature still called the Big Dogs and which had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landed their potential lay dormant - they were little more than the feeding and excreting machines they had seemed to be . Their initial programming was to set up the shit piles and jewels . If intelligent creatures existed on a world they visited , such creatures would , the Big Dogs believed , be drawn to the jewels . Of course , other sorts of creatures might be attracted as well , and the Big Dogs did n't want to waste time on squirrels and turtles . The shitdogs " barking and avoidance behavior were the first line of defense , but the Big Dogs needed a more pervasive disincentive . So the shitdogs were designed to analyze the local biology and produce the vilest smell imaginable . The assumption was that virtually all carbon-based life would have senses responsive to chemical stimuli , and that only intelligence would ignore a horrific stink for nothing more tangible than curiosity . Only intelligence would grasp that ten percent beauty was well worth ninety percent shit . And so only a long series of interactions , cumulatively proving the intelligence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , first by semiotic manipulation , and at the climax by direct stimulation of the limbic system . Those most fascinated by the shitdogs would be the likely candidates for consumption . After they were eaten , the dogs would analyze the genetic makeup of those ingested , modify themselves correspondingly , and incorporate memory RNA from their supper . So we faced a group of twenty-five Big Dog aliens , their own intellects fully activated , but incorporating the memories and knowledge of the humans they 'd gobbled , and thus able to understand human society , to communicate , to function as participants in the human world . Much to my dismay , the brand-new Big Dogs also got the personalities of those they 'd devoured . So the world is being forced to deal with a set of super-intelligent aliens , with knowledge of the universe that dwarfs our own , led by a creature that just happens to have the character of Blaine Thorp . He 's been awfully nice to me , all things considered . And why not ? He lost every battle and still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the universe and he knows it . Thorp Dog has even asked me to head up the human liaison team . So obviously having his IQ boosted to Epsilon Eridani has taught him something . I have Wetherall to thank for this , except that I still ca n't decide what to do with him . Murk langlish was right , after all . I guess I 've sunk my hooks into him . I 'm just not sure whether I should keep him or throw him back . Tonight on Eye , critic-at-large Dennis Ngomo takes a first look at architect Nguyen O'Hara 's controversial plans for building Convergence World . Are the piles built by the former shitdogs an appropriate site for a water slide theme park ? Dennis will put that very question to O'Hara and his lawyer , Murk Janglish , in a few moments . Later today , America , America 's own Penelope Hunt sits down with alien leader Blaine Thorpdog , who reminisces about his boyhood in Iowa and explains the principles of faster-than-light travel .
