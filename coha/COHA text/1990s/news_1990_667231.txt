<p> Legg Mason Inc. has pulled the wishbone on its annual Thanksgiving stock picks . The Baltimore-based brokerage firm 's fondest wish for this year 's list : It wo n't end up like last year 's . <p> Badly mauled by the bear market that began in July , the Thanksgiving List that Legg Mason picked last November turned in the worst performance in the 12-year history of the list . All 12 of last year 's picks ended lower . Eleven turned in losing total-return performances , which include dividends . Average total return for the 1990 list : a 24.6% loss , vs. a 10.6% drop in the S &P; 500 . <p> That 's what you get when you lock in picks with no bear market in sight - and virtually no one was forecasting a bear market last November . Legg Mason tends to pick stocks that will grow faster than the overall market in bullish times . Such stocks generally fall faster than average when the whole market falls . <p> Since the Legg Mason Thanksgiving List began in 1979 , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16.8% for the S &P; 500 . Last year 's list was only the second ( after 1987 's ) to underperform that broad market index . <p> This year 's picks , made public Wednesday , were made by Bob Quasman , the firm 's new director of research . As in past years , equal amounts are assumed to be invested in each pick . <p> The 1991 list was culled from about 45 stocks that Legg Mason recommends for purchase . On average , the picks are 39% below their 52-week highs . " There 's no single theme , but they all seem to offer an attractive risk-to- reward ratio , " Quasman says . <p> The list includes one holdover from last year - Beckman Instruments . As of Tuesday , shares of the laboratory-equipment maker had fallen 28% since they were named to Legg Mason 's 1990 list . " We put it back on our recommended list about three weeks ago , " says Quasman .
