<p> In their first day back to school , the 1,300 students at William H. Maxwell Vocational High School may have felt a bit like the fictional Alice walking through the looking glass . The sturdy brick facade of their school - built for the elementary grades in 1912 in Brooklyn 's hard-edged East New York neighborhood - looked deceptively familiar . But once inside its walls , students found a whole new world . As part of a $ 45.5 million renovation , the cramped and outdated interior - in which the lunch room had no kitchen facilities , two awkwardly combined classrooms served as a makeshift gym , and limited space made it impossible for the school to assemble as a whole - had been gutted . It was replaced with rows of clean and roomy new classrooms , science and computer labs , and even an auditorium and music room . An addition begun in 1994 was also completed over the summer , offering a cafeteria , gymnasium , and center to accommodate the children of teen mothers . The transformation of William H. Maxwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more sobering picture awaits a large segment of children in United States public schools as several forces collide . Enrollment is surging as children of the baby boomers feed through the system . A crop of schools built in the 1920s and ' 30s are coming of age , while buildings slapped up hurriedly in the 1970s and ' 80s are fraying . At the same time , a wave of state property tax caps following California 's Proposition 13 is challenging renewal efforts . Add these together , and the infrastructure of the nation 's public schools appears to be buckling under their combined weight . According to a 1995 report done by the General Accounting Office , about one-third of American schools , serving 14 million students , need extensive repair or replacement . About 60 percent of all schools are estimated to need replacement or repair of at least one major feature . The GAO estimates a total of $ 112 billion would be required to ensure that all schools were in good working order . Such numbers understate the problem , says Thomas Kube , executive director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ariz . " Depending on whom you talk to , it would require $ 112 billion to $ 150 billion just to deal with deferred maintenance , " says Mr. Kube . " Then there 's another $ 15 billion to build new schools . " The stories of decay and disrepair are legion . There 's a school in Los Angeles where the fire alarm goes off each time it rains . One New York City school put up scaffolding several years ago to protect students from crumbling pieces falling off its aging structure - only to find that eventually the decaying scaffolding was dropping on students ' heads . Students in one New Orleans school were alarmed to discover termites eating away at the shelves in their library . Adding further pressure is the need for new schools . High school enrollments are expected to increase nationwide by 13 percent between 1997 and 2007 , with rapidly growing states in the South and Southwest showing gains as large as 80 percent ( Nevada ) and 49 percent ( Arizona ) . One county in Georgia estimates that it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its population growth . Yet funding such projects can deeply divide towns . The problem is not really a new one , says Eleanor Johnson , assistant director for education and employment at the GAO . On the contrary , as a nation , " We do this quite regularly . " Dr. Johnson says she was fascinated when she recently found editorial cartoons from the 1940s and ' 50s dramatizing the poor physical condition of many of the country 's schools . " There were even some from immediately after World War I that showed the overcrowded schools even as we were busy erecting skyscrapers . " Johnson 's theory is that " We go in 20- or 25-year cycles . We build a rash of schools and then they 're ignored . " Today , she says , we 're on the downswing of one of those cycles . Johnson insists that the nation has the money to deal with the problem . But , she says , the question remains , " Do we have the will to spend it ? " As part of its 1999 budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay interest on nearly $ 22 billion in bonds to build and renovate public schools . " Some say the federal government should n't have a role in school construction , " says Julie Green , a spokeswoman for the US Department of Education . " But given the magnitude of the problem , it 's essential . Our legislation would help to build and modernize 5,000 to 6,000 schools . " But many are skeptical that the government can help much . Sure , says Kube , the legislation puts " about $ 22 billion on the table to build schools , money that that states might not have had otherwise . " But compared with the magnitude of the problem , he adds , " It 's a drop in the bucket . " Traditionally , localities have borne the brunt of school building and repair costs , although almost half of all states also offer some financial assistance . In Maryland , for instance , says Yale Stenzler , executive director of the Maryland public schools construction program , there 's a strong history of state funding and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he says , " We 're in a good position relative to what 's going on in some other states . " The state has set aside $ 225 million in 1999 for school repairs and construction , about 65 percent of the $ 340 million in estimated needs . But that 65 percent figure is a strong one compared with many years in the past , says Mr. Stenzler . " We were in the 20 to 40 percent range for a long time . " Just now , he says , school building funds are strengthened by the fact that " the economy is strong and the needs are really there . " Not all localities are as fortunate as those in Maryland , however , he points out . " It depends on the district , " he says . In some districts , " They 're at the crisis point . " And it 's not just a funding shortfall that creates problems , experts say . Some say it 's been so long since the last surge of school construction that most school districts have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a project , and many school districts will be vulnerable to corruption and inefficient practices . Others worry that there are no national standards for school facilities , which makes it difficult to ensure that poor neighborhoods are getting buildings as sound as those in more-affluent areas . Still others fret that there 's not enough focus on the needs of today 's higher-tech education or the focus on smaller class size . But in Brooklyn , William H. Maxwell principal Barbara Elk says she 's just plain grateful . A recent study by the city comptroller estimates that over the next decade , New York 's 1,028 aging schools will require $ 28.4 billion in repairs . The budgeted amount is $ 12.5 billion . The new school sends a message to students , says Ms. Elk . " It shows the kids we like them , we feel good about them . " Kube puts it more strongly . A clean , well-cared-for building " sets a tone for the rest of a child 's life . " <p> THE FIVE AGES OF SCHOOL BUILDINGS * Phase 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maintenance costs normally are limited to minor repairs and small improvements to reflect changes in the instructional program . * Phase 2 : the period between 20 and 30 years . Facilities require increasing amounts of annual maintenance and more frequent replacement of worn-out equipment . * Phase 3 : from 30 to 40 years . General maintenance needs increase rapidly . Most of the original equipment should have been replaced , and major items , such as roofs and lighting fixtures , will need replacing during this time period . * Phase 4 : from 40 to 50 years . This is a time of accelerated deterioration . A 50-year-old building is frequently too new to abandon , if well constructed , but too old to be an effective resource . * Phase 5 : more than 50 years old . Usually the building should be completely reconstructed or abandoned . Source : University of Michigan study <p> * E-mail comments to : coeymanm@csps.com
