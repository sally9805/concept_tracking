<p> MAR DEL PLATA , Argentina - Those 790 Team USA athletes who will gather here for the XIIth Pan American Games have some flashy shoes to fill . And we 're not talking Nikes or Reeboks . <p> Try on these names for size : Evelyn Ashford , Joan Benoit , Tracy Caulkins , Althea Gibson , Bruce Jenner , Rafer Johnson , Michael Jordan , Jackie Joyner-Kersee , Sugar Ray Leonard , Greg Louganis , Steve Lundquist , Oscar Robertson , Wilma Rudolph , Frank Shorter , Mark Spitz and Bill Toomey . <p> All competed in the Pan American Games . And that 's only a sample of the alumni list . <p> " When you think of all the big names who have been in the Pan Ams , it makes you feel proud and excited that you 're going to be a part of it , " said Team USA swimmer Amy Van Dyken of Englewood , one of 68 Coloradans in the contingent of 790 athletes . " Being able to represent your country is a big deal . " <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Central and South America , are scheduled every four years in the summer preceding the Olympic Games . The Pan Am Games are held in March this time because the seasons are reversed in the Southern Hemisphere . It is late summer/early autumn here . <p> As usual , the U.S. expects to dominate the competition . Team USA has won the medals count in every Pan American Games except the first - 1951 in Buenos Aires . The U.S. finished second to host Argentina ( 150-95 ) that year , when Americans were entered in just 15 of the 21 sports . A total of 21 nations and 2,513 athletes competed in the inaugural games . Approximately 5,000 athletes representing 42 nations will travel to Argentina this time . The program has grown to 37 sports , several of which begin competition today . <p> Those spiffy Team USA warm-ups come equipped with a few additional pounds of pressure . Although the U.S. won the medals race by a 352-265 count over runnerup Cuba in the last Pan American Games ( 1991 in Havana ) , the host Cubans earned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an ideological embarrassment by the U.S. contingent , which vowed to never let it happen again . <p> But there will be competition . The Cubans will be strong in boxing , baseball , track and field and men 's and women 's volleyball . Brazil is favored in soccer and several track and swimming events . Canada 's hopes begin with rowing and equestrian . Argentina figures to make noise in soccer , men 's basketball and tennis . <p> Americans , hurt by the March timing of these games , might have to jump a bit farther , pedal a bit faster , swim a bit stronger and shoot a bit straighter during these next 15 days . Each U.S. athlete will " Go for the Gold . " But each also has a special , more personal reason for succeeding , for being here . <p> Here are some of their stories : <p> Pole vaulter Pat Manson of Aurora figured he would fly to Argentina via Barcelona , Spain , where the World Indoor Track and Field Championships are being held this weekend . Unfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pan American Games . <p> Manson , the most dominant American pole vaulter the past eight months , failed to place among the top two at the recent Mobil U.S. Indoor Championships in Atlanta and thus missed out on the trip to Spain . He will try to redeem himself in the Pan American Games , where he enters as a defending champion . <p> He won in Havana with a vault of 18-0 1/2 , but set a personal best with 19-2 1/4 last fall . He ranked 10th in the world in 1994 . <p> " This is where you get to wear ' USA ' across your chest , " said Manson , a former Aurora Central and University of Kansas star who still trains in Lawrence , Kan . " When you compete in meets in Europe , it 's like pro tennis - they say you 're from the United States , but you 're really competing as an individual . The Pan Am Games gives you a chance to represent your country . I 'll take every opportunity I can to represent my country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Resident Swim Team coach Jonty Skinner has suspected all along - that Van Dyken , a 50-meter freestyle specialist , also could become a gold-medal threat in the 100-meter butterfly at the Atlanta Olympics . <p> Van Dyken set a world record in the short-course , 50-meter butterfly last month in Finland with a time of 26.73 . Van Dyken was n't disappointed that the mark was broken 10 days later by Australia 's Angela Kennedy . Van Dyken could n't believe the record had been hers at all . <p> " That was a shock because we had n't tapered our training and were n't prepared to swim fast , " Van Dyken said . " And it did n't feel like a world record . " <p> Apparently , it did n't look like one , either . But that only showed Van Dyken 's potential in the butterfly . <p> " Jonty said it was the ugliest swim he 'd ever seen , " she said . " He said a 10-year-old could have made a better turnaround , and that my stroke was the worst . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . <p> " He was really surprised by the time because of how I looked . I was really psyched up after that . He told me that 's just the first of many ( records ) . He said I can go much faster . " <p> Van Dyken , a Cherry Creek High School graduate , gave up her final year of eligibility at Colorado State last fall to join the resident program at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs . She will be joined here by other resident swimmers Tripp Schwenk , Jon Olsen and Mark Henderson . Van Dyken is expected to swim the 100-meter freestyle and butterfly and on relays , but not the 50 free . <p> " Our training is pointing for Atlanta , but I 'm anxious to see where we are , " Van Dyken said . <p> For Colorado Springs gymnasts Kristy Powell and Donielle Thompson , the Pan American Games means two words : Shannon Miller . <p> Powell , who won the all-around title at the prestigious American Cup in Seattle last weekend , and Thompson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance to be her teammate . <p> Powell , 15 , and Thompson , 14 , are on pace to peak for Atlanta ; Miller , who has won more Olympic and World Championship medals than any American gymnast ( male or female ) in history , turned 18 Friday and is trying to hang on until 1996 . <p> " Kristy and Doni can learn a lot from Shannon , " said Tom Forster , who with his wife , Lori , coaches Powell and Thompson at the Colorado Aerials gymnastics school in Colorado Springs . " The Pan Ams are really important for their development because there are so few times in this sport that you compete as a team . <p> " This is different . You might have to adjust your routine so it helps the team . It 's a different mind set for an athlete . If you want to be a strong contender for Atlanta , you need this kind of experience . " <p> Judo champion Grace Jividen of Lakewood might feel old when she passes those pixie gymnasts in the athletes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who placed seventh in the Barcelona Olympics , turns 31 in June . She won her first U.S. Olympic Festival gold medal in 1983 , when some U.S. members of the Pan Am delegation were toddlers . <p> " You 're talking about the tail end of your career , " said Jividen , a Buffalo , N.Y. , native who moved to Colorado in 1981 to train . " I know my heart is still firing . I want to be in Atlanta . I 'm going for it . " <p> Jividen , 5-foot-5 and 145 pounds , figures she could have earned a medal in Barcelona if she had n't fractured an elbow seven weeks earlier , an injury that later required surgery . As it was , Jividen came within one point of a possible bronze medal . <p> There 's also a revenge factor . Jividen lost to Yamilia Gonzalez Bayard of Cuba last October in the Pan American Championships at Santiago , Chile . <p> " We 're both going to be in the finals ( of the Pan American Games ) , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I ca n't wait . " <p> Having won 15 of the last 17 World Cup mountain-bike races the past two years , Durango 's Juli Furtado has little to prove . <p> She just wants to have some fun , see a bit of Argentina and , most important , introduce mountain biking to an untapped market . The World Cup circuit has events in the U.S. , Europe , Canada and Australia , but nothing in South America , or even Mexico . <p> Mountain biking makes its debut as an Olympic medal sport in Atlanta . <p> " The Pan Am Games are going to be good for the experience ; I 'm not worried about the results , " said Furtado , who will be favored to win the women 's gold medal . <p> " This is going to be an Olympic-type atmosphere . It will be exciting . "
