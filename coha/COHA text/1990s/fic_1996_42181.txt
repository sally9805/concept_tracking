WHEN I WAS GROWING UP , my brother Peter was always asking questions . He 'd follow me around with this puzzled , serious look on his face and wait until his big sister was ready to pay attention . <p> " What 's a half-brother ? " he wanted to know once . He was sitting on the floor next to my bed , squinting up at me through his new glasses while I lay across the bedspread reading a mystery magazine . I had one of those gooseneck lamps that I 'd twisted in my direction , and from where Peter was sitting it was pointed right at his eyes . <p> " A half-brother ? " <p> " Willie says Sam 's his half-brother . " <p> Willie and Sam lived next door . They were part of what used to be called a yours , mine , and ours family . There were nine children in all . Willie and Sam were both Peter 's age , brothers born a week apart . <p> " That 's a good question , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he said , pleased with himself and not suspicious at all . <p> So I told him how some families , too poor to afford lots of sons and daughters but too proud to have a small family like ours , share children . That way they get some help with the kids ' support but can still mount an impressive display for family occasions . That 's how people can say most American families have one and a half children . And it does n't stop at half-brothers and - sisters . Some families split their children three , four , even ten ways . It depends on how much time you spend at each home . <p> I can still recall Peter 's trusting face looking up at me as I explained the secrets of extended families . For weeks he tried to catch Willie and Sam sneaking off to their other homes . And after he finally confronted them with his knowledge , he said he hated me and would never ever believe me again . <p> " Fool me twice shame on me . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all said no one was going to trust me for a very long time . That was what happened to liars . <p> My mother wanted to know what I was trying to prove . <p> " For the life of me , I ca n't understand why you could n't just tell him the truth for once , instead of trying to make your brother look silly . " <p> She was standing in my light , casting a huge shadow over the bed where I was lying . This time I 'd been reading a movie magazine . <p> " Why ? Do you enjoy making him upset ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Then why ? " <p> " I did n't know he 'd go chasing them around and spill the beans . " <p> " But why ? " <p> My mother 's like that : she gets a question in her head and there 's simply no escape . <p> " Because it was more interesting . " <p> " Interesting Why does everything have to be so interesting to you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was interesting and true ? " <p> I thought about that for a full minute while she stood and waited for my answer . I was trying to come up with an example of something that fell into both categories . God , I thought  --  but no . God is great and God is good and true , I told myself , but  --  and here I was remembering the long and tedious sermons we had to sit through every Sunday  --  God is not very interesting . Science and math are true , too , but they 'll put you in a coma if you are n't careful . <p> I 'd never given it much thought before , but that evening in my bedroom , with my mother standing over me and Mickey Dolenz of the Monkees staring up from the cover of my magazine , I came to the conclusion that interesting was Tommy Sands running away from home and coming back with a thousand stories that all turned out to be lies . It was n't the truth of a scared little boy huddled next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the things he made up about sneaking through the backyards in the rich part of town under a full moon . " I saw a swimming pool there , " he told me , " so big there was a sailboat in the middle of it . " <p> I closed my eyes and tried to imagine the sails shimmering in the moonlight . There would be waves in a pool of that size , and I could almost hear them as they lapped against the side . When I opened my eyes , I was still in the shadow cast by my mother . Of course , I did n't tell her all this . I avoided the larger question and got by on a technicality . <p> " He did n't ask me anything like that , " I said . " He asked me about half-brothers . " <p> " Well , he wo n't ask you anything at all for quite some time , " she said . <p> But she was wrong . The next evening he was back in my room . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Patriots and had been trying to learn his lines when he came across something that did n't make sense . <p> " What is it ? " I asked . <p> " He said ' Waste not , want not . ' Does that mean anything ? " <p> I thought about telling him that what Ben was trying to say was that if you did n't waste something you must not have wanted it in the first place . I could imagine the confused look on my brother 's face as well as the long story I 'd relate about the strange form of madness that overtook Ben toward the end of his life . I 'd make up some other sayings that made even less sense and tell him to remember this when he was onstage trying to pretend he was a crazy man . <p> But I did n't . I told him the truth . And he looked at me suspiciously and walked away unconvinced . <p> Fool me twice shame on me . <p> As time went on , however , his mistrust faded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened . When he went away to college , he used to sign his letters " your one-tenth brother " in reference to the few weeks of each year he spent at home . And after he graduated and moved away , he seemed to take perverse enjoyment in just how small he could make that fraction . <p> I was the one who was left behind . That was the way I thought of it , like a slow student who 'd been held back from the next grade . I drifted through the local college , taking one interesting course after another and ending up with an impractical degree that had little to do with sitting behind the reference desk at our local library , the job I was lucky to get after I graduated . And it did n't make any sense leaving home then , since I was n't making a lot of money and housing was so expensive . I was left behind . And I could n't help but feel that my betrayals of my brother years earlier were somehow responsible for driving him away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridiculous idea when faced head-on , but it had a habit of popping up now and then on the periphery , quite convincingly . <p> It was our last meal together . When my parents and I got into our cars and left for work the next morning , I was going to keep driving past the library and head west , toward Pittsburgh and the Mississippi River . Before they realized what was going on , their daughter would be in a different time zone . The farther I went , the earlier it would become . <p> No one knew what I was planning . If they had , my parents would 've ruined this evening with their objections and my favorite foods . My life as a guest in their home would 've already begun . They would 've spoiled the short time we had left together trying to make me see how unreasonable I was . I 'm going and that 's that , I 'd say , reaching for another helping of butter beans . <p> People will tell you that ignorance is bliss , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the meat loaf or passed plates to my mother and me . This was my last chance to notice what this life of mine had been like , and I tried to commit the entire meal to memory , from the way my father chopped his vegetables to my mother 's habit of lightly tapping her fingers against a napkin as she chewed . I felt like a rescue worker sent into a burning building . This detail , that image , a snippet of conversation and its accompanying facial expression : when I left I was going to carry all these away with me . <p> " I 'm afraid the gravy 's a bit lumpy , " my mother said . <p> It was better this way . There would come a day , probably only a few years down the road , when I 'd be willing to exchange all I owned for the chance to revisit this evening , to sit once more between my parents and listen to them talk about gravy . The longing to undo the events of tomorrow was so strong it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was excited about leaving . It did n't have to make sense , I told myself . I 'm going and that 's that . <p> " I 'm worried about Peter 's new business partner , " my father was saying . " What 's his name " <p> " Roscoe something-or-other , " my mother said . <p> " An ex-lawyer who 's spent the last ten years doing something shady in South America ? " He shook his head and tried to spear part of a bean with his fork . " Just the ex-lawyer part would 've been enough warning for me . " <p> " I wonder if he 's ever going to settle down , " my mother said , referring to my brother . She put her hand out and touched me as she said this , including me among the ranks of those who 've somehow managed to settle down . Is that what she thought I 'd been doing for the last decade ? <p> " I think he 's just fine the way he is , " I said quietly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen jobs , and gone bankrupt at least once since leaving home , Peter was a man of very regular habits . He called home every other Sunday night at precisely eight o'clock . I could imagine the wall calendar by the phone in his kitchen with the reminder written under the date . Even worse , I could imagine him sitting at his table on New Year 's Day , writing CALL HOME under a year 's worth of alternate Sundays . <p> There was a pattern to his calls as well . He 'd talk to Mom and Dad for about fifteen minutes , covering any real news he had to share . By the time I got on the phone , he was usually tired of talking about himself . He wanted me to remember something we did together . <p> " Do you remember the time you talked me into giving Mr. Ryan a comb ? " he asked once . <p> Mr. Ryan was the principal of our elementary school . When Peter was in second grade , I convinced him to give Mr. Ryan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with a card that read : If the Shoe Fits , Wear It . And even though Peter did n't see the point of it all , he went and did it to make me happy . He wrapped the comb and left it with Mr. Ryan 's secretary before class started in the morning . <p> " Do you remember the great big bow I taped to it ? " <p> By the time he 'd finished wrapping the small black comb , the package was as big as a football , gleaming under a mass of Scotch tape . The bow was Peter 's idea . I remember hearing later how he 'd been called out of class in the middle of the morning . I could n't believe it when I was told how our nasty , totally bald principal had laughed and laughed at my prank . Another man might 've gotten angry , he told Peter with a big smile , but he was a man who appreciated a good joke . <p> Of course , Peter had n't understood how good fortune had snatched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only later , when he failed to live up to his reputation as a daredevil and class wit , that the story changed from one of glory to betrayal . <p> Or instead of reminiscing , he might encourage me to talk about myself : " So what have you been doing ? " <p> " I have this idea , " I 'd begin . <p> " Tell me , " he would say , in nearly the same voice he used years earlier when he 'd sneak into my room late at night and listen to my stories . <p> " It 's about a series of paintings . Very realistic , almost photographic paintings of small midwestern towns . Each town should be no larger than a few thousand people , like Bucklin , Kansas , or Ogden , Iowa . Paint a panoramic view of the town , but place in the center of it , as accurately as possible , a large and very recognizable New York skyscraper . The Chrysler Building , for example . Right in the middle of the town . Everything drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Or : " I have an idea for a detective novel with a woman detective as cynical as those jaded private eyes from the ' 30s . With sentences like : She liked her affairs like her eggs , over easy . Do you know what I mean ? Sure it 's a gimmick , a simple twist , but I have n't been able to get her out of my head all week . She liked her men like her eggs , sunny-side up . That 's not quite right , but can you see what I 'm getting at ? She liked her something like her eggs , hard-boiled . Now what would this woman like hard-boiled ? I need your help on this one . " <p> " Sounds like a series of egg jokes . " <p> " No , no , That 's just an example . I was thinking out loud . A woman Sam Spade , that 's my idea . " <p> Usually Peter listened for a while and either laughed or , if be thought I was taking myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know how to paint . " Or : " What do you know about writing a novel ? " <p> " It 's only an idea , " I 'd say . <p> Eventually I 'd run out of things to say , and we 'd hang up . I 'm sure that for my brother these calls were like traveling back in time , to the days before he grew up , left home , and had business partners . There was one thing we did n't discuss , but which was implicit in the enjoyment he took in our conversations : how little I 'd changed , how he could listen to my voice and imagine I was fourteen years old , or twenty , or twenty-five . It did n't matter what part of his life he wanted to revisit ; my voice and the stories I told would take him there . And I resented this a little , I suppose , in the same way that people who live in resort areas must resent those who come from the outside and walk around in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live like this all the time ? As if the locals are n't living a real life after all , as if their cares and worries are n't as important as everyone else 's . <p> I was asleep when the phone rang at ten-thirty . I 'd planned to stay up late my last night at home , but once I got to my room after dinner , I realized there was n't much left to do . My clothes were already sitting in a suitcase in the trunk of my car . I started reading through some old papers but fell asleep after a few minutes . <p> It was my brother . Mom called mg name , and I sat up in the darkened room . What time was it in Los Angeles ? Three hours earlier , I told myself , staring at the little hand on my clock pointing north by northwest . <p> " I 'm sorry I woke you up , " he said . " I just got home from work . " <p> " That 's OK . " As my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his office earlier in the day . " Thanks for calling back . " <p> It was warmer than when I 'd gone to sleep . The sheets were damp , and the room smelled faintly of sweat . I took a Kleenex from the dispenser and rubbed it up and down my arm . Everything seemed so closed up , like I 'd shut myself in for years instead of one night . <p> " You wanted to talk to me ? " <p> " I 'm running away from home , " I said . <p> " You are ? " I could tell from his voice that he thought this was a joke . " When you get to be our age , is it still called running away from home ? " <p> " Mom and Dad do n't know yet . I 'm leaving in the morning . " <p> " OK , " he said , and paused . " Is this something I 'm supposed to talk you out of ? " <p> " Of course not . " <p> " Tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in the night sky somewhere because its light filtered through the curtains , forming a dim triangle on the rug next to my bed . The moonlight lay across the stack of papers and notebooks I 'd been looking through before falling asleep . Nearby , in the shadows , was the box I 'd taken them from . <p> " Did you know I saved things ? " I asked . <p> " Things ? " <p> " School papers , notes and letters from friends , shopping lists , New Year 's resolutions  --  everything , It 's really pretty overwhelming . " <p> In addition to the box near the bed , there were two in the closet just like it . <p> " You would n't believe some of this stuff . What could I have been thinking ? I saved this note my girlfriend Denise passed me once in biology . Was I really worried that I 'd forget Denise or the stupid green ink she always used ? " <p> " What happened to her ? " <p> " Oh , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip to Maryland the summer after high school , sent me a 3-D postcard of the Last Supper  --  the one where Jesus ' eyes open and close as you move it  --  with ' Jesus Saves ' scrawled across the back in black magic marker , and ended up moving to Idaho with some guy she just met . " <p> He did n't say anything for a second . " Does this have anything to do with you leaving home ? " <p> " I do n't think so . " I held up my hand into the moonlight and watched its shadow move across the floor . " About six months ago I had this idea ; I 'm sure I told you about it  --  the personalized calendars ? " <p> " I forget . You have a lot of ideas . " <p> " This one was a winner . You mail me fifteen dollars and I send you your own calendar . On each day there 's some notable achievement done by a person who was exactly as old as you are on that day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same age Jack Kerouac was the day On the Road was first published . " <p> " Is that supposed to explain  --  ? " <p> " I 'm getting to that , " I said , and took a short breath . " A man worked at the library last year , Scott Sanderson , and when he heard about my calendar he said it was a great idea . With the right equipment and business strategy , he was sure we could make a fortune . Of course , he wanted to focus on sports figures and market it toward men , but why stop at one type of calendar ? " <p> " I take it Scott no longer works at the library ? " <p> " He moved back to Kirksville , Missouri , two months ago . His parents teach at a university there . " <p> " That 's where you 're going ? " <p> " Yes . He says he can get the computer equipment we 'll need , and I already have a job interview lined up at the library . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was telling someone else about our plan , I was n't sure it made sense . Even my friends had no idea what was going on . The only person who knew I was n't coming to work tomorrow was my boss , and she thought I 'd be taking a leave of absence to visit Europe . <p> " You 'd like him , " I said when my brother turned silent all of a sudden . My words sounded pathetic , and I would n't have blamed him for laughing at me . <p> " I probably would , " he said . <p> " He actually listens to what people say . He really does . " <p> " Is that so unusual ? " <p> " For a man ? " I asked , and laughed , glad the immediate focus had shifted away from my plans with Scott . <p> " I was out with this man once  --  probably our second or third date , I forget . We 're in this restaurant and he 's holding both my hands and I swear there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice  --  I think that 's the only reason I went out with him in the first place  --  and he wanted me to tell him what I was thinking about at that moment . He had n't known me very long , but he said he was pretty sure he knew what was on my mind . And so I told him about my idea for a movie where a terrorist hijacks an airplane , unaware that all its passengers are villains from horror movies . You know , Jason and Freddy and so on . " <p> There was a punch line to that story , but when my brother started laughing I could n't remember what it was . <p> " I need you to do me a favor , " I said instead . <p> " You want me to tell the folks . " <p> " I 'll call them once I 'm settled , but I do n't want them worrying in the meantime . " <p> " When should I phone ? " <p> " Before dinner tomorrow . Their dinner , not yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Sure . " There was a silence while I supposed he wrote himself a note . <p> " There 's only one thing I want to know , " he said . " I mean , I know I 'm in no position to act as the voice of reason , but if this calendar project does n't pan out  --  and there 's always a chance people wo n't flock to buy something that seems calculated to make them feel crappy about their own lives  --  " <p> " It 's not supposed to make anyone feel anything . I only thought people might find it  --  " <p> " Interesting , I know . And you might be right . I mean , if I had a talent for anticipating public reaction I would n't be sitting in a one-bedroom apartment . All I 'm saying is that if the idea does n't make you both rich , will you regret leaving ? " <p> " Who knows I might regret it no matter what happens . " <p> I 'm pretty sure that was n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " Should I tell them when you 'll be calling ? " <p> " Just say that I 'll do it as soon as I can . Does that sound all right ? " <p> " Sure . " <p> I took the phone away from my ear and coughed . It bothered me that the room seemed so musty . Some night soon , sitting on a sofa in my new apartment , I might want to close my eyes and pretend I 'd been transported back here . And this smell would now forever be part of the room I imagined . <p> I had to ask my brother to repeat himself . <p> " Tell me about tomorrow , " he said . <p> " Well , " I said , and cleared my throat . " I 'll leave the house at the usual time . Any earlier and they 'd get suspicious . " I was almost whispering . " I should be on the Pennsylvania Turnpike by lunch and in Ohio around dinnertime . " <p> " That 's pretty much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> " I know . " <p> " Will you spend the night in Ohio ? " <p> I closed my eyes , and the line was completely silent , free of any static the call might 've picked up on its cross-country journey . I was imagining where I would spend the night . Earlier I 'd unfolded a map and stared at any number of roads cutting across the interstates of Ohio . Many of them led directly into the white space between small towns like Pasco and Pandora . <p> " I 'll pull off the interstate at some point , " I said , " and go looking for a motel . Perhaps I 'll get lost driving on roads too small to have made my atlas . By this time it will be close to eleven o'clock , and I 'll have been on the road all day . " <p> " Go on , " he said . <p> But I did n't want to . I had this clear image in my head and was not about to share it with anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate where I 'd stopped to ask directions . No one would be home . I 'd peek through the front window at sheets covering all the furniture , as if the owners had been away for years and years . The path around back would seem treacherous in the moonlight , but I 'd follow it to a patio and a pool so large I 'd be afraid to look across it . <p>
