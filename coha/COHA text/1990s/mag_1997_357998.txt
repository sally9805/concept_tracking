If Andy Grove is so smart and technology companies so hot , why are Intel and just about every other tech stock falling off a cliff ? Was n't it only four months ago that our Man of the Year 's company proudly sported a $100 stock ? Now it 's at about $70 . Click on that , new-era geeks . The stock market may be chaotic and irrational from day to day , but over longer periods it 's a pretty fair measuring stick for what 's coming . The message here is that no boom lasts forever , and the one that Grove and tech-dom have been riding this decade is ripe for some kind of interruption . <P> That 's not to say the pace of technological change is slowing . In fact , you have n't seen anything yet . Companies like Intel , Microsoft , Compaq , Cisco Systems and Oracle have plenty more cyber stuff on their drawing boards . What 's in question is how much of it they will sell , how soon and at what price . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of business there before the region 's economies imploded . Intel , for example , has been getting 28% of its annual revenue there and will surely feel a sting from the slowdown . <P> White-hot competition is another part of the equation , and it 's a jarring reality pretty much across the tech board . Success breeds imitators . Imitators flood the market with goods . Prices ( and profits ) come down . Again , take Intel . It supplies nearly 90% of the microprocessors in PCs worldwide  --  a more commanding grip than even Microsoft 's stranglehold on PC operating systems . But to protect its position , Intel has cut semiconductor prices faster than anyone expected as rivals Cyrix and Advanced Micro Devices compete furiously to supply cheaper components for the $1,000 PCs now taking the world by storm . Intel 's profit margin has eroded from nearly 63% a year ago to an estimated 58% today , says analyst Caroline Gangi at Lehman Bros . Margin erosion may be Intel 's biggest problem . The company expects the figure to hit about 50% before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tech companies faced serious questions on the demand side . Firms have invested heavily in PCs and other " must-have " gadgets in the past few years . Sure , the stuff is really cool . But executives want to see payback before they extend the binge . It 's unclear whether PCs and , say , Internet connections have made office workers more productive or simply more distracted . ( Websites that seem to get the most hits are those featuring swimsuit models . ) Real-world users of technology should n't fear that the ship is sinking . It 's not . But for now tech stocks are , and investors may not get whole for a while . It 's worth noting , though , that even with its recent 30% decline , Intel 's shares are up fourfold in three years . Tech stocks , on average , have risen about twice as fast as the Dow Jones industrial average since June 1994 . That pace was unsustainable no matter how much Grove and company may change the world .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
