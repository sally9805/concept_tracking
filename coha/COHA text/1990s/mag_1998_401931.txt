Nearly a thousand years after its birth , the Crab Nebula still glows with the fury of a newborn . Photograph Photograph On July 4,1054 , an object brighter than the brightest star appeared near the crescent moon . Anasazi skywatchers in Chaco Canyon ( now in New Mexico ) likely saw this supernova and recorded it in this petroglyph. // THOUGH THE SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION took place almost a thousand years ago , the aftermath still rages . Vast clouds of gas and dust , flung from the eruption , arch outward into arcs and jets that extend for light-years . Amid the debris of this exploded star pulse powerful waves of electromagnetic energy , racing along flux tubes larger than entire solar systems . In the center of this maelstrom sits a superdense ball of neutrons about ten miles across , the size of the eye of a typical hurricane . Once , this tiny orb was a majestic sun of great color and beauty , outshining the stars around it for thousands of light-years . Now its nuclear fires have died , leaving behind the slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what an active and dangerous corpse it is . The carcass , one and a half times heavier than the sun , is squeezed into such a small volume that a handful of its " soil " would weigh several million tons . Spinning madly at a rate of thirty times per second , it throws out charged particles in such violent gusts that the radio signal it emits is one of the strongest in our sky , even though it lies more than 6,000 light-years away . Intense x-ray and gamma radiation would instantly kill any human foolish enough to venture closer than a dozen or so light-years . As these immense waves of electromagnetic energy roll outward , they act almost like garden rakes , shaping and twisting the huge debris cloud into the delicate filaments and knots we see from Earth . This is the Crab Nebula , a colossal , highenergy laboratory in space and one of the brightest , nearest , and most recently formed supernova remnants . And while astronomers have been passionately studying the Crab for more than 150 years , they have only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hester of Arizona State University noted in 1996 , " The Crab is so dynamic that if you wait more than about a week to take your next look , you 're going to get the wrong impression because things have changed so terribly much . " Exploding into View On the night of July 4 , 1054 , Chinese astronomers first noted the appearance of a brilliant beacon in the constellation Taurus the Bull . We now know that this " guest star " marked both the cataclysmic death knell of a supergiant star and the birth pangs of the Crab Nebula . But the nebula remained entirely unknown until John Bevis , an English doctor and amateur astronomer , first glimpsed it with his telescope in 1731 . Seventeen years later , the French comet hunter Charles Messier rediscovered it independently . Because the " nebula had such a resemblance to a comet " in the primitive telescopes of the time , Messier decided to compile a list of similar objects so that future comet hunters " would not confuse these same nebulae with comets just beginning to shine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which this object was designated M1 . When the Third Earl of Rosse noted in 1844 that the nebula reminded him of a crab , the name stuck . For the next hundred years astronomers struggled to learn the Crab 's origin . They closely monitored the nebula and saw significant changes in its appearance over periods of less than a decade . By the 1920s they were able to measure its expansion rate and deduced that the nebula had been expanding for approximately 900 years . This information , coupled with the nebula 's proximity in the sky to the supernova of 1054 , indicated that the two events were probably linked . In 1942 , the radio source at the Crab 's center was discovered , and in 1954 , astronomers confirmed that the luminescence of the central white cloud was polarized , proving that this cloud was energized by a powerful magnetic field . Then , in 1968 , astronomers taking high-speed photos of a dim star at the center of the Crab showed it to be winking on and off thirty times a second . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of objects known as pulsars . Theorists quickly recognized that only a tightly packed ball of neutrons spinning at an incredible rate and beaming radiation as it does so could behave like this . These socalled neutron stars , first postulated in the 1930s , are the collapsed cores of exploded stars . Finding one at the center of the Crab established beyond doubt that this nebula was the wreckage from a supernova . Since then , the Crab Nebula has probably consumed as much telescope time as any object in space . As one of the sky 's brightest supernova remnants across a broad range of wavelengths , from radio waves to gamma rays , the Crab affords scientists the chance to study a star as it shudders through its last and violent death throes . A Bowl of Spaghetti At the center of the nebula is the tiny pulsar , a neutron star whose 30times-per-second rotation is tilted about 30 degrees from our line of sight . As the pulsar rotates , its magnetic poles sweep past us like lighthouse beacons , causing the famous pulses . For almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern . They have found that the Crab beats with the double beat of a typical human heart , a main pulse followed immediately by a weaker pulse , with a higher " bridge " of energy in between . Every ten minutes or so comes a " mega " pulse , with a strength about a thousand times that of normal , and every three to five years a " glitch " appears in the pulse rate , when the pulsar 's spin suddenly increases and then slowly returns to its old rate after several weeks . Though astronomers know that the mega pulses are triggered by powerful electrical fields within the pulsar 's 1,000-mile-high magnetosphere , they do not yet comprehend their cause . " This is an enormously complex process , and we really do n't understand the specifics , " says James Cordes of Cornell University . Some astronomers think that the glitches take place when the pulsar 's magnetic axis shifts relative to its rotational axis . Others believe they result from starquakes that take place in the neutron star 's crust . This crust , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean of superdense neutrons . The spin rate of the pulsar causes the ocean layer to form tiny atom-sized whirlpools , not dissimilar to the much larger hurricanes on Earth and Jupiter 's Great Red Spot . As the spin rate slows , the star wants to reduce the number of vortices , moving them outward into the crust . But they ca n't move because they are pinned to the crust 's dense crystalline lattice . When the pressure has built sufficiently , however , there is a sudden release , some vortices escape , the star 's crust shifts a couple of inches , and a starquake results . This transfer of angular momentum causes the glitch , thereby increasing the spin rate of the entire star for several weeks . Meanwhile the pulsar 's whirl acts as a powerful dynamo , producing a magnetic field that spans a dozen light-years . This field is incredibly strong , generating an electrical field of about 243 trillion volts per foot on the surface of the pulsar while also emitting 1,800 thousand trillion amperes of energy per second . Like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outward at almost the speed of light , following the magnetic field 's lines of force . As these charged particles are accelerated by the magnetic field , they produce what is called synchrotron radiation , which can be seen as the hazy white inner cloud of the Crab . The Crab 's energy output is mind-boggling by human standards . Were this tiny pulsar to replace our sun , the visible light hitting Earth would increase by a modest six times , but the x-ray energy would be 250 times more intense and the solar wind would blow 130,000 times more powerfully . " You 'd be cooked almost instantly , " says Hester . Much like the sun 's solar wind , the Crab 's synchrotron wind does not fly away equally in all directions . At the equator roll waves of expanding concentric ripples , sweeping up supernova debris before them . When a team of astronomers used the Hubble Space Telescope to take eight pictures of this region over five months in 1995 and 1996 , they could actually see these waves surge outward from the pulsar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speed of light . As the waves hit the thicker nebulous clouds , they would pile up and slow down , producing arclike wisps . The wind would then race outward , dragging the magnetic field lines with it as it spiraled away from the star through a complex weave of flux tubes akin to a bowl of spaghetti floating in space . From the pulsar 's poles shoot two high-powered jets . Along the southeast jet 's axis , which points toward Earth , were discovered two inexplicable knots of matter . The larger knot , approximately 140 billion miles from the pulsar and about 10 billion miles across , was the brightest feature in the entire synchrotron cloud in 1994 . The astronomers found that over a six-month period it actually appeared to move closer to the neutron star , and that the knot 's light was highly polarized . Farther out along the axis , almost a trillion miles from the pulsar , is what the scientists have named the " sprite ; " because it seems to dance about from Hubble picture to Hubble picture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Anvil , and is now thought to be a shock in the relativistic jet as it plows out through the synchrotron nebula . No one really understands entirely what these two knots are . " When I show these pictures to theorists they get real uncomfortable , " notes Paul Scowen of Arizona State University . " None of their theories had predicted such objects . " As the charged particles fly outward through the magnetic spaghetti , they push against the outer shell of dust and helium gas ejected when the star exploded and which now lies about six light-years from the pulsar . This wind pressure creates a type of cloudy " skin " the delicate weave of red and violet filaments and knots that seem to surround the central synchrotron cloud . As the wind presses against these outer cloud banks , the denser knots , some as large as 150 billion miles across , more successfully resist being blown away . Instead , as the wind blows past each knot , long filaments trail out behind , pointing away from the pulsar and appearing reminiscent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crab lies a pulsar the crushed remnant of an exploded star . The pulsar powers the twin jets of high speed particles and the outward moving equatorial wisps . As one of the jets slams into the surrounding nebula , it generates a small " sprite " that brightens , fades , and moves around . // This interaction between the inner synchrotron field and the outer skin locks the Crab Nebula into a gigantic electronic cage . While the electromagnetic energy of the inner synchrotron cloud is very good at ionizing matter , it ca n't cross the conducting field of such particles . When it hits the outer cloud banks , it immediately ionizes them , thereby creating the very trap that holds it . Not Enough Energy Despite the vast size and scale of this energetic object , it is still too small to fit the facts . As Dale Frail of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory notes , " The amount of energy and matter that we see in the Crab is on the order of one percent of what a type II supernova should produce . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapse of a star having at least 8 to 10 solar masses should fling its explosive debris at speeds ranging from 3,000 to 6,000 miles per second . The Crab contains less than half this mass and the fastest moving sections of its outer nebula move at less than a third this speed . After 1,000 years of expansion , the nebula is still much too small . In 1977 , Roger Chevalier proposed that the missing material was hidden in a much larger invisible shell surrounding the visible nebula . Such a shell would not only account for the missing mass , it would be expanding at the velocity expected for a type II supernova while also being the right size . Unfortunately , most astronomers have been unable to find this outer shell . Recent radio observations by Frail have indicated that it simply does not exist . " We 've looked deeper than anyone has ever , and we should have seen something . There was nothing there " Still , some believe that the shell exists . Because the Crab is located more than 600 light-years above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty part of space , they think the supernova blast wave dissipated so quickly that it is now undetectable . Hester and Ravi Sankrit , a graduate student at Arizona State , propose that the outer " skin " seen in the Hubble photos represents the collision between the synchrotron radiation and the inner regions of this invisible shell . Other astronomers discount the possibility of an invisible shell , and are looking more closely at the visible knots and filaments . More recent Hubble photos taken by a team led by William Blair at John Hopkins University indicate that at least some knots appear at least ten times denser than originally thought , and might possibly contain some of the missing mass . Yet , more problems remain . The elements in these filaments do not fit what scientists expect from a type II supernova , which should leave lots of nitrogen in the nebular cloud . Not only does there seem to be a lack of nitrogen , but it is distributed unevenly throughout the cloud . While the northern filaments are rich in nitrogen , in the south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprising quantity of argon . In the next few years astronomers will take more photos of the Crab and hope to answer some of these questions . For example , Hester 's team plans to use Hubble to take one picture every ten days for a nine-month period that was scheduled to begin in August 1998 . " We ca n't wait to take these pictures , " says Hester . " We 've seen enough to know that there are fascinating things going on , but we have n't seen enough to really know what they are . " While the astronomers might be impatient , time is not really a problem . Though the Crab Nebula represents a star in its final agony , the death watch is expected to last for at least another million years.II Photograph In less than four months in early 1996 , the Crab 's inner region saw drastic change .
