There were tears in Los Angeles and cackles in a certain New York City borough on Jan. 6 . Forty years after his father removed the family business to L.A. from Brooklyn , Peter O'Malley announced that he was selling the firm  --  namely , the Dodgers . By transplanting the beloved Bums to California in 1958 , the unsentimental Walter O'Malley had ushered the era of Big Business into baseball ; last week Peter claimed that the current game 's corporate-scale economics were forcing him to sell . Something about the sins of the father leaped to the minds of people whose hearts are still in Brooklyn . <P> In all fairness , Peter O'Malley , 59 , is a step up in class from his late father . Since taking over the team in 1970 , Peter has run one of the most respected and stable organizations in baseball . First baseman Eric Karros , who recently signed a four-year , $20 million contract to stay Dodger Blue , said , " You talk to players who have been in Los Angeles and gone elsewhere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way the organizations are run and the way they are treated . " The Dodgers had just two managers from 1954 until 1996  --  Walter Alston and Tommy Lasorda . Off the field , O'Malley treats his staff to ice cream at 2 p.m. on every day the club is in first place . The best ticket in Dodger Stadium is $12 , which is a cheap seat in most parks . <P> Fred Claire , the Dodgers ' general manager , knew something was up when O'Malley called on Jan. 4 requesting that they meet the next day , Sunday , at 10:30 a.m . " When I hung up the phone , " Claire said , " I thought to myself , ' He 's going to sell . ' It 's not unusual to meet on Sunday , but what was unusual was that in 30 years , I really could n't think of a time when Peter did n't say what we needed to talk about . " <P> Family ownership of a team , O'Malley felt , had become an anachronism . Successful as they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual attendance figure that hovers at 3 million , the Dodgers claimed to be losing money . " Professional sports is as high risk as the oil business , " said O'Malley , who with sister Terry Seidler owns almost 100% of the team . " You need a broader base than an individual family to carry you through the storms . Groups or corporations are probably the way of the future . " O'Malley also felt alienated by the politics of baseball ; he thinks the commissioner should be an outsider and not Milwaukee Brewers owner Bud Selig , who has presided over the game during disastrous labor relations . <P> And like members of other wealthy families , O'Malley may have felt the tug of the next generation , which often needs to put checking accounts ahead of box scores . Says Bob Graziano , the Dodgers ' vice president of finance : " Peter and Terry combined have 13 children . A baseball team is not very liquid for those people . " Left the team as part of an estate , the O'Malley beneficiaries would pay an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $5 million , as opposed to a capital gains tax of about 28% on profits from selling the team .
