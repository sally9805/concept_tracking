ZERO : Sometimes They Get In This much we know : that the Innensburg bloom began with a single spore ; that Immune response was sluggish and ineffective ; that the first witness on the scene , one Holger Sanchez Mach , broke the nearest emergency glass , dropped two magnums and a witch 's tit , and died . Did he suffer ? Did it hurt ? Conversion must have taken at least four seconds , and we can probably assume it started with the feet . These things usually do . By the time the Response teams began arriving , the bloom was some ten meters across , and two meters high at the center -- a fractal-jagged bubble of rainbow fog , class two threaded structure almost certainly visible to those unfortunate enough to be standing within fecund radius when the fruiting bodies swelled and popped . Twenty deaths followed almost immediately , and another hundred in the minutes that followed . There were cameras and instruments on the scene by this time , windows on what can only seem to be separate events , each holograph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soundtrack recording a different cacophony of whimpers and death screams and jarringly irrelevant conversation . I personally have collaged these scenes a dozen times or more , arranging the panic this way and that way , over and over again in the hope that some sense will emerge . But there is no sense in those first few minutes , just the pettiness and blind , stamping fear of the human animal stripped bare . And the heroism , yes ; for me the central image is that of Enrico Giselle , Tech Two , pushing his smudged helmet and visor back on his forehead and shouting into a voice phone while the walls behind him froth and shimmer and disintegrate . " Class five ! Class five ! Drop two hundred and flush on my command ! " At this point , finally , the city began to awaken . The Immunity isolated samples of the invading mycorum , sequenced them , added them to the catalog of known pathogens . Better late than never , one supposes , but by this time the bloom outmassed the city 's Immune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submicroscopic phages gathered at its sizzling interface , now ropy with tendrils that sputtered outward in Escheresque whorls , the growth was not visibly affected . Fortunately , like all living things , technogenic organisms require energy to survive , and where the witch 's tits had fallen or been hurled , pools of bitter cold had arrested the replication process . Not unusual , as any Response officer will tell you . And like organic lebenforms , mycora are also vulnerable to excess energy . Backpack UV lasers were proving effective weapons against the bloom , and soon the streets clanged with discarded chem spritzers and paraphage guns as bloomfighters concentrated on the things that worked . High above the city , the cavern roof came alive with UV turrets of its own . Machine-guided and wary of the soft humans below , the beams swept back and forth , charring trenches through the rainbow mist , the living dust , the bloom of submicroscopic mycora still eating everything in their reach and converting it to more of themselves . And to other things , as well , a trillion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaningless program the mycogene codes called out . By now the fecund zone was half a kilometer across , riddled with gaps and voids in the outer regions but much denser at its core , a thickening haze that already blocked the view from one side to the other . Up to four stories tall in places , higher than most of the surrounding buildings , and it had begun to take on structure as well -- picks and urchins , mostly , standing out visibly in the haze , their prismatic spines lengthening more than fast enough for the human eye to see . Some mycora eat lightly , sucking up building blocks like carbon and hydrogen while leaving the heavier elements alone , but this one was pulling the gold right off the streets , the steel right off the shingled walls , the zirconium right out of the windowpanes . You 've seen the pictures : a giant bite out of Innensburg 's south side , gingerbread houses dissolving like a dream . The UV lasers , while no doubt satisfying for those employing them , were if anything adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , giving it that much more energy to work with , to feed on . Finally , Innensburg 's central processor sought permission from the mayor and city council to move to Final Alert . Permission was granted , the overhead lights and household power grid were shut off , the ladderdown reactors stopped , and the air system reconfigured to pipe through cooling radiators closer to the surface . The cold , the dark . How we humans hate these things , and how very much we need them ! Like all Jupiter 's moons , like all the moons of the outer system , Ganymede 's surface is cold enough to liquefy both oxygen and nitrogen , and while the spore-fouled air was not cooled quite that far , Innensburg 's ground temperature quickly dropped below the freezing point of water , and then below that of carbon dioxide . A seconds-brief rain fell and froze . Mycoric replication slowed to a crawl . A sigh of mingled fear and relief went up all over the city , visible as columns of white steam in the flashlight beams of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now survivable , now something that could be dealt with in a reasoned , methodical manner . Some thirty-one deaths were later attributed to the cold , to the darkness , to the lack of domestic power and computing , and while some of the families did attempt to bring suit against the authorities responsible , public and judicial outrage squashed the move before it had gotten very far . One hundred and eighty-seven deaths preceded the chilldown , after all , and most of Innensburg 's fifty thousand residents came out of it with only minor injuries . Throughout the Immunity , our problems are the same : so far from the places of our birth , so far from the sun 's warm rays , so far from the lives we once expected to lead . Eaten by the Mycosystem , those lives , and billions of others as well . And yet out here in the cold and dark we hang on , even thrive , because we 're brave enough to believe we can . If the space around us is lousy with mycoric spores blown upward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do what 's necessary to keep them outside . I think the Honorable Klaus Pensbruck , in closing the book on Glazer v. Cholm , speaks for us all with his immortal words , " Shut up , lady . We do n't want to end up like the Earth . " ONE Destination Where ? That my first meeting with Vaclav Lottick went poorly goes without saying . The most powerful man in the solar system , yes , you can believe he had better things to do than exchange small talk with me . And yet , certain business can be conducted in no other way . He looked up and smiled when his secretary , a quiet , efficient man , ushered me inside the office . Everything beige and cream and shiny , not quite sterile in appearance but compact , and clean . Very clean . The windows ' light was from behind Lottick , highlighting every stray hair , and the desk lamp seemed designed to show off the lines in his face . A pale man , nearly bald , his rumpled smock no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blocky , folding his ears back , weighing on the bridge of his nose , leaving his features to sag that much more . " John Strasheim , hi , " he said , rising from his chair and extending a hand . " Thanks for coming on such short notice . " Shaking his hand , I shrugged . " Happy to help , I guess . What can I --  " " Take a seat , then . Set to receive a flash ? " " Sure . " His thick fingers danced in the space between us . My receiving light went on , and the air before me came alive with information , image windows and text windows and schematic windows rastering in and then shrinking to icons as my spec compressed them in working memory . It was too quick to see much in the way of detail . Pictures of blooms , I thought . Pictures of mycora . Well , what else would one expect from the Immunity 's head of research ? I sat . " I 've seen your work , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And read it . Funny , how nobody seems to be doing that sort of thing anymore . " " You 're talking about Innensburg ? " He nodded . Behind the zee-spec , his eyes were bright green . " Yes , Innensburg . I survey your net channels from time to time , but it was that piece that really caught my eye . About as close as we have to a regional history , and plaintext was a ... curiously appropriate choice of medium . Very astute . I stayed up all night reading it . " " Thank you , " I said , nodding once to accept the compliment . Then I smiled politely , waiting . Whatever he 'd invited me here to discuss , this was n't it . He studied me for a moment , then relaxed , turning off the charm like a lamp he no longer needed . " All right , then . " His fingers stroked the air , manipulating symbols and menus I could n't see . One of my image icons began to flicker . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lower right corner of my vision . It was a video loop , false-color , depicting a complex mycorum which replicated itself in slow motion , over and over again . Not quite crablike , not quite urchinlike , not quite organic in appearance . A tiny machine , like a digger/constructor but smaller than the smallest bacterium , putting copies of itself together with cool precision , building them up out of nothing , out of pieces too small for the micrograph to capture . In short , a pretty typical piece of technogenic life . At the bottom of the window scrolled a horizontal code ribbon showing , in a series of brightly colored blocks , what was presumably the data gene sequence which dictated both the mycorum 's structure and behavior . " This , " Lottick said , " is Io Sengen 3a , a sulphurated mycorum with unknown environmental tolerance . Gave us a scare a while back when we thought it could replicate in the volcanic flows on Io , but that turned out to be a false alarm . Now we 're concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I nodded , waiting for more , not yet sure why he was telling me this . " You know that mycora mutate quickly , right ? Everyone knows that . A key strength , a key factor . The whole Mycosystem probably depends on this , or it would have died out long ago . " " So I 've heard . " " Yes , well , what you probably have n't heard is that they 're stealing data gene sequences from our own phages . Nothing major , nothing all that important , but the mechanism and its potential limitations are not known at this time . " " Stealing gene sequences ? " I repeated stupidly . My skin had gone cold and crawly . Mycora were not intelligent , not even alive , really . How could they steal ? " It 's probably nothing , " Lottick said . " Statistically , the chance that they 'll steal something important and actually be able to use it to their advantage is ... well , it 's zero , basically . But we do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people upset . Including me . What if the Mycosystem gets hold of some of our environmental adaptations ? What happens if they stumble on nuclear fission , or cascade fusion , or , God help us all , they manage to copy some of our ladderdown designs ? " " I do n't know , " I said , still cold . " What ? " He shrugged . " They eat the solar system , I guess . They eat the universe . It 's not going to happen , Strasheim , but that 's the worst-case scenario we 've got to work to . Hence the mission . " " The starship ? " I asked , puzzled but optimistic . Whatever the problem was , these people seemed to be on top of it . Sort of . " The starship , yeah , right . " He chuckled , sounding tired . " We get it built , we fuel it up , we go on our merry way , every single person who wants to . That 's not going to happen either . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's best for the time being , but the real goal of the program is to get our spores out to the neighboring stars before the Mycosystem beats us to it . Immune system fully established , deny the mycora a toehold even in the warm , bright spaces . But we 've probably got a thousand years to worry about it , and a lot to keep us busy until then . " " So what are we talking about ? " " The Louis Pasteur , " he said . " You may have heard about it here and there ; the program is being accelerated in a big way . Ship is designed for inner-system **27;28;TOOLONG , high-radiation , also the t-balance hull -- theoretically bloom-proof . But of course , ha ha , we 're not going to test that here on Ganymede . The only way to test it is to fly it down there , into the Mycosystem , and see if anything eats it . We hope to do that soon , and if the testing goes well , we 'll fly it all the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes : even in the inner system , there are places too cold , dark , barren for mycora to bloom . If any serious cold-weather adaptations start appearing , the first signs of it will probably be there . So we drop a few detectors on some polar caps , and suddenly we do n't have to worry about this problem anymore . Not unless the detectors start screaming at us , which I do n't think is going to happen . " " Are these state secrets ? " I asked , turning to look at his face . " Can I talk about this stuff ? " His look was disapproving . " There are no secrets , Mr. Strasheim . There 's barely any state , and I did n't invite you up here to waste your time . If we did n't want you to talk about this , what would we want you for ? You have skills which nobody else in the Immunity seems to possess . You 're a commentator , an historian ; you record simple facts in a way that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be very useful for this project , if you 're willing to lend it to us for a while . " " It sounds fascinating , " I said sincerely . " I take it you want me to write an article ? " Lottick looked at me as if I were somewhat stupider than he 'd been expecting . " No , son . I thought we understood each other . I want you to go on the mission . "
