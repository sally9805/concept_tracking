<p> Being needy and disabled is not a matter of choice <p> Sen. Mike Coffman 's letter ( Feb. 19 ) regarding Aid for the Needy Disabled payments to people who are addicted to drugs or alcohol misses several points and misconstrues others . <p> Having worked for six years with homeless street alcoholics and addicts , I can assert that Aid for the Needy Disabled does truly serve the needs of society as well as the real needs of addicted individuals . The $ 229 monthly payment allows recipients to attain a stable , albeit humble , apartment and to make contact with a caring individual who can actually help them find treatment . The paltry sum ( which represents far less than 1 percent of the total state budget ) assures them a reliable income and a chance to regain their lost dignity . <p> Senate Bill 63 implies that addictions are not disabling and that addicted people somehow choose , and even enjoy , such disability . Doctors who must determine the disability do not recommend a monthly check for addicts who are unlikely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is far less pervasive than those who oppose it would admit . <p> Of the 500 individuals we worked with at Stout Street Clinic of the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless , 75 percent of the recipients made significant positive life changes . The relapse potential is only somewhat more notable among addicts than among cancer patients who continue to smoke or among diabetics who consume sweets . <p> As the Senate committee rightly noted , compassion should be extended and punitive measures should not have part in our society 's care for disabled people . To imply that addictions are somehow not sufficiently disabling , or that the suffering incurred should not merit our care or concern , seems only to confirm the stereotype that government of the people is no longer for the people . <p> JACK REAL <p> Director of Education and Advocacy <p> Colorado Coalition for the Homeless <p> Denver <p> Landowners deserve compensation <p> Paying " just compensation " to landowners for " takings " makes common sense for everyone , despite what The Denver Post said in its Feb. 20 editorial , " Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions . " <p> Private compensation claims have not been " successfully balanced against the public 's interest on a case-by-case basis for the past 200 years . " <p> The average " takings " case takes 10 years and costs $ 500,000 for both taxpayers and plaintiffs . To say $ 500,000 is in the taxpayer 's best interest is pushing the envelope . <p> As a cattleman , I know I ca n't afford to pay half a million dollars to go to court , and I 'm sure very few of The Post 's readers could afford such an expense . <p> The problem is , the public wants to protect the environment and endangered species , but it 's not the public that 's being asked to pay to protect the environment and endangered species - it 's the landowner . <p> As a cattleman , it 's in my best interest to take care of the environment upon which my livelihood depends . Why would I wish to harm the environment ? <p> The Post also was incorrect in saying just compensation would be paid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws , that would prohibit environmental degradation from industrial plants that discharge toxic wastes into rivers . <p> Paying just compensation to landowners for " takings " is not only the fair thing to do but the American thing to do . Everyone pays , everyone benefits . <p> JAMES E. ANDERSON <p> Longmont <p> Reactions to article on CPA ethics <p> Two critical points were missing from your Feb. 20 article regarding CPA ethics : <p> 1 . The CPA exam is a national exam . The same test is given in all 50 states . <p> 2 . Licensure differs from certification . An individual with a CPA certificate must be licensed by the State Board of Accountancy to practice in Colorado as a CPA . <p> Additionally , it is unethical for anyone to hold himself out as a CPA , such as signing " CPA " after his name , unless he has an active license in that state . <p> SANDY ADAMS , CPA <p> Candidate for Denver auditor <p> Denver <p> It was with dismay that I read your article ( Feb. 20 ) regarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a voter always seeking qualified candidates to support , I find this type of reporting reprehensible . The headline does nothing but attempt to discredit Ms. Adams and her campaign . <p> How will we ever get more qualified candidates to run for public office if they can only expect to receive biased and misrepresentative coverage by the press ? <p> I believe that Sandy Adams is the only truly qualified candidate for Denver auditor - I believe that she 's a breath of fresh air in the fog of professional politicians seeking the post - Sandy Adams gets my vote , and I hope your readers look past your headlines to the true story and vote for her , too . <p> SUSAN G. PETERSON <p> Denver <p> There are few safeguards for cab drivers <p> Gene Lucero , a fellow cab driver , was brutally murdered on Feb. 22 . Like many local cab drivers , he had no insurance . Metro Taxi , for whom he worked , is not providing assistance to the family . <p> Donations are being taken through the Gene Lucero Memorial Fund at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Meanwhile , a lesson must be learned through this tragic death . The cab industry must change . Currently , there are few safeguards for taxi drivers . The Public Utilities Commission , which oversees taxi companies in Colorado , is only concerned about reducing service times and ensuring that drivers can not refuse fares . Denver needs a Taxi Authority like those in other cities to regulate our industry and help devise more ways of protecting cab drivers . <p> Taxicabs provide a vital service to our community . However , if drivers do n't feel secure in providing this service , they wo n't do it . It is getting harder to hire qualified and knowledgeable people because of this lack of security , and until more safeguards are designed , this trend will continue . <p> PAUL HILTON <p> Lakewood <p> Gay ' marriages ' are sick perversions <p> Regarding proposed sick-leave for partners in gay " marriages " : I 've known a few gay " marriages " over time . They were nothing but sick and twisted perversions of a real marriage . If this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to the point of abusing the system , all the while laughing at the stupid taxpayer . <p> GARY HIGLEY <p> Grand Junction <p> Balanced budget <p> amendment is misleading <p> The balanced budget amendment under the " Contract with America " does not protect the people against fiscally irresponsible government . It is " the fox guarding the chickens " amendment . <p> Through a budget accounting gimmick , the federal government has masked , and continues to mask , a large portion of the true budget deficit with money borrowed from Social Security programs and Part A Medicare surpluses . Under the amendment , the government probably would continue deficit spending to the extent of these surpluses . When the need to pay the debt to these programs arrives , I am certain Congress will be happy to borrow money from the public sector through its three-fifths majority vote . <p> If this amendment is ever ratified by the states , our founding fathers will turn over in their graves . <p> STEPHEN J. MANCUSO <p> Highlands Ranch <p> Magazine exploits sex <p> After reading " The Sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 Denver Post , I felt sorrow - and a need for this member of the silent majority to speak out . <p> For big money , individuals at Sports Illustrated magazine are willing to prostitute women and corrupt people . Apparently , SI could n't survive without adding exploitative sex , so they 're sneaking into our homes in sheep 's - excuse me - sports clothing . <p> In addition to God 's existing law , there should be a human law against something so demeaning to women . <p> THOMAS A. BURTSCHI <p> Lakewood <p> Transit tames aggression <p> One aspect of the public and private transportation controversy that has received scant mention is personal interaction . My observation is that people using public transportation tend to be more civil toward each other than those driving Denver area streets in private autos . Granted , there are more opportunities for conversation when seated together on bus or light rail ; but there is also less need for , and display of , aggression , rudeness and belligerence than when individuals behind the wheel of their own cars compete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
