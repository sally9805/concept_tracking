<p> ' Let the Games begin . " ( Please ! ) For after years of talk about security , transportation , tickets , and endless organizational plans , Atlanta is finally poised to shift attent to where it belongs - on sports . <p> After Friday night 's Opening Ceremony before a packed stadium and billions of TV viewers , the early-bird events of 16 days of athletic competition begin . <p> Field hockey kicks off the Games with a Day 1 wake-up call , namely , an 8:30 a.m. women 's preliminary game . <p> A squad of women take aim in the air pistol event at 9 o'clock , and by the time NBC airs later in the day , some Annie Oakley will probably have roped in the Games ' first gold medal . <p> Having a woman first up on the victory stand offers a striking counterpoint to the first modern Olympics in 1896 , when women were excluded . <p> The sometimes lethargic Olympic movement has decided to up the pace of female participation , at least athletically . While falling short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men ) , women will nonetheless compete in record numbers , thanks to the addition of women 's soccer and softball , and expanded fields in other sports . Part of the reason Atlanta was selected to host the Games , says Richard Pound , a high-ranking International Olympic official , is that the Centennial Games want to move ahead , not live in the past . Athens might have seemed the logical place , having hosted the first modern Olympics . <p> On the occasion of such a landmark anniversary , however , people will naturally want to look back . The United States plans a reunion of its 100 greatest living Olympians tomorrow . One use of an anniversary is to measure progress . The Olympic motto , " Citius , Altius , Fortius " is generally taken to mean " Swifter , Higher , Stronger , " and the Games have certainly achieved that mandate . Look at two events on the original Olympic program : the men 's 100 meters and high jump . In 1896 , Thomas Burke won the 100-meter dash in 12 seconds flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the high jump , Ellery Clark cleared 5 ft. , 11-1/4 in. 100 years ago to win in Athens ; in Atlanta the winner will probably leap nearly two feet higher . ( The world record is 8 ft. , 1/2 in . ) <p> Speaking of world records , the most impervious modern mark in men 's track and field fell to sprinter Michael Johnson , a projected superstar of these Games , just weeks ago . Running at the US Olympic trials , Johnson shaved six hundredths of a second off the 19.72 clocking registered by Italy 's Pietro Mennea in 1979 . Johnson , a hot-weather Texan , appears primed for more fleet-footed fireworks during the Games . He will attempt to become the first man to win both the 200 and 400 meters , and the first to accomplish the feat at a nonboycotted Olympics . <p> Game officials have accommodated Johnson 's desire to attempt this double by switching the track and field schedule , allowing him a day 's rest between events . Still , he must successfully run eight races in seven days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Pomp , purpose , and passion are often cross-wired under the Olympic big top , which unarguably houses the greatest athletic show on earth . This time , the sheer breadth of participation is breathtaking , with a full house of 197 countries and states sending athletes . Even reluctant North Korea has come . <p> Palestine will be represented for the first time , as will such little-known geopolitical entities as Comoros , Nauru , and Guinea-Bissau . <p> The Olympics shall long continue to have its superpowers , but the good news multiculturally speaking , is that athletic excellence seems to be more widespread . <p> Take track and field , for instance , which is at the very center of the Games . Thirty-five countries won medals at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics , and at last year 's world championships , the laurels were even more widespread , with 43 countries registering on the win-place-and-show tables . Ghada Shousa , a Syrian in the seven-event heptathlon , took her country 's first world championship in any sport . Such breakthroughs have become more and more common , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is becoming . <p> For the most part , it seems a friendlier one , too , now that cold-war tensions are a receding memory . One of its last vestiges was the Unified Team , which tenuously maintained an alliance among a number of the former Soviet republics in 1992 . This time , everybody 's on their own . <p> The Games wo n't be without some political tensions . Cuba will hope to make an impression under Uncle Sam 's nose while watching warily for team defections like those that struck at the baseball and boxing rosters recently . <p> Croatia and Yugoslavia are expected to engage in a fierce basketball battle for the silver medal ( the gold has all but been awarded to the US Dream Team ) , and possibly for the gold in water polo . Another arena where events may create a sense of uneasiness is swimming , where the Chinese made such a splash in 1992 that Western powers became highly suspicious . A number of Chinese women subsequently tested positive for drugs , but now the wrongdoers have supposedly been expunged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match for the dryland stunts of a host of brilliant gymnasts , including the most decorated 1992 Olympian , Belarus 's Vitaly Scherbo , who won six gold medals in Barcelona . <p> At the Games , however , women gymnasts often hold center stage , and American stars like Shannon Miller and young Dominique Moceanu , ( if recovered from injuries ) could conceivably share the medals podium with the East Europeans . <p> Revamped sports program <p> The Olympic brass has retailored the over-all Games program . Beach volleyball and mountain biking have been added . Solo and duet events in synchronized swimming have been have dropped to go instead with a team competition . <p> Modern pentathlon , the run , shoot , swim , fence , and ride discipline favored by Olympic founder Baron de Coubertin , has been shrunk from four days into one . Lightweight crews will debut in rowing . <p> One significant change that may not be readily noticeable to the unpracticed eye will occur in cycling , where professionals now are eligible . <p> That could turn the Olympics into a fascinating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon enough to allow Miguel Indurain , Lance Armstrong , and other superstars to cool their wheels . The Games continue to move toward " open " competition . One sport that refuses to follow the trend , perhaps to its own peril , is baseball . <p> But if Major Leaguers are still denied entry , at least baseball in the Olympics will have a Major League backdrop . All games will be played in Fulton-County Stadium , home of the Atlanta Braves . The Braves will move into the new , reconfigured Olympic Stadium next year , ( this summer 's track and field venue ) . <p> The Games end Aug. 4 , but not exactly the way organizers planned . They had hoped the men 's marathon would conclude the Olympics , as is traditional , just as the Closing Ceremony is about to begin . However , heat was a concern , and the race was rescheduled to begin at 7 a.m . <p> The marathoners wo n't be denied a stadium reception , though , since tickets to the race 's finish have been sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olympic ovation , especially for those expending the last ounce of athletic energy of the Centennial Games .
