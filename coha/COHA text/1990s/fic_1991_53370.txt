Their plans were to develop the valley , and my plans were to stop them . I was caretaking this ranch in Montana that the two of them had bought , or were buying . one of them was an alcoholic and the other was a realtor . The alcoholic  --  the big one  --  was from New York and did something on the Stock Exchange . <p> The realtor had narrow , close-together eyes , little pinpoints in his pasty , puffy face , like raisins set in dough . He wore new jeans and a Western shirt with silver buttons and a big metal belt buckle with a horse on it , and he walked in his new cowboy boots in tiny little steps with his toes pointed in . He always walked that way . The realtor  --  Zim  --  was from Billings . <p> The big guy 's name was Quentin . He had a big round stomach and a small mustache , and looked like a polar bear . <p> The feeling I got from the big guy was that he was recovering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out here . And Zim  --  grinning loose-necked , giggling **31;56;TOOLONG , always walking around as if he were an infant who 'd just shit his diapers  --  Zim , the predator , had just the piece of Big Sky Quentin needed . I 'll go ahead and say it right now , so that nobody gets the wrong idea : I did n't like Zim . <p> It was going fast , the Big Sky was , said Zim . All sorts of famous people  --  celebrities  --  were vacationing there . Moving there . " Brooke Shields , " he said . " Tom Brokaw . Jim Nabors . Rich people , I mean really rich people . You could sell them things . Say you owned the little store in this valley  --  the mercantile  --  and say Michael Jackson  --  well , no , not him  --  say Kirk Douglas lives ten miles down the road . What 's he going to do when he 's having a party and realizes he does n't have enough Dom Perignon ? Who 's he gon na call ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a service . Say the bottle costs $75 . You 'll sell it to him for $100  --  you ' deliver it you 'll drive that ten miles up the road to take it to him  --  and he 'll be glad to pay that extra money . <p> " Bing ! Bang ! Bim , bam ! " Zim said , snapping his fingers and then rubbing them together , his mindless raisin eyes set so far back , glittering . His mouth was small and round and pale , like an anus . " You 've made twenty-five dollars , " he said , and the mouth broke into a grin . <p> What 's twenty-five dollars , to a stockbroker guy ? But I saw that Quentin was listening . <p> I 've lived on this ranch for four years now . The guy who used to own this place before Quentin  --  he was a predator , too . A rough guy from Australia , he had put his life savings into building this mansion , this fortress deep in the woods , looking out over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Beauregard . He had built the mansion three stories tall , rising up into the trees like one of Tarzan 's haunts . Beauregard had constructed , all over the property , various buildings and structures related to the dismemberment of his quarry : smokehouses with wire screening to keep the other predators out , and butchering houses ( long wooden tables , with sinks , and high-intensity interrogating lamps over the long tables , for night work ) . There were even huge windmill-type hoists all over the property , which would be used to lift the hoof-sprawling animals  --  moose , bear , elk , their heads and necks limp in death  --  up into the sky , so that their hides could first be stripped , leaving the meat revealed . . . <p> It had been Beauregard 's life dream to be a hunting guide , and he wanted to take rich people into the woods , so they could come out dragging behind them a deer , or a bear  --  some wild creature they could kill and then take home with them  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the business went down and the bad spirits set in and he got divorced and had to put the place up for sale to make the alimony payments . The divorce settlement would in no way allow either of the parties to live in the mansion  --  it had to be both or none  --  and that 's where I came in : to caretake the place until it sold . They 'd sunk too much money into Beauregard 's mansion to just leave it sitting out there in the forest , idle . Beauregard went back to Washington , D.C. , where he got a job doing something for the CIA  --  tracking fugitives was my guess , or maybe even killing them , while his wife went to California with the kids . <p> Beauregard had been a mercenary for a while . He said the battles were usually fought at dawn and dusk , so sometimes in the middle of the day he 'd been able to get away and go hunting . In the mansion , the dark , noble heads of long-ago beasts from all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gazelles , and giant oryx  --  lined the walls of all the rooms . There was a giant gleaming sailfish leaping over the headboard of my bed upstairs , and there were woodstoves , and fireplaces , but no electricity . This place is so far into the middle of nowhere . After I took the caretaking position , the ex-wife would send postcards saying how much she enjoyed twenty-four-hour electricity and how she 'd get up in the middle of the night  --  two A M. , four A.M.  --  and flick on a light switch , just for the hell of it . <p> I felt like I was taking advantage of Beauregard , moving into his castle while he slaved away in D.C.  --  but I 'm a bit of a killer myself , in some ways , if you get right down to it , and if Beauregard 's hard luck was my good luck , well , I tried not to lose any sleep over it . <p> If anything , I gained sleep over it , especially in the summer . I 'd get up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big breakfast , and feed my dogs , and then go out on the porch and sit in the rocking chair , and look out over the valley or read . <p> Then about noon I 'd pack a lunch and go for a walk . I 'd take the dogs with me , and a book , and we 'd start up the trail behind the house , walking through the centuries-old larch and cedar forest , following the creek up to the big waterfall  --  heavy , heavy timber . Deer moved quietly through that forest , big deer , and pileated woodpeckers , too , banging away on some of the old dead trees , going at it like cannons . It was shady back in that old forest , and the sun rarely made it down to the ground , stopping instead on all the various levels of leaves . I 'd get to the waterfall , and swim  --  so cold ! - with the dogs , and then they 'd nap in some ferns while I sat on a rock and read some more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be hot then , in the summer  --  the fields and meadows all around the ranch smelled of wild <p> strawberries , and I 'd stop and pick some when I came out of the forest . By that time of day it would be too hot to do anything but take a nap , so that 's what I 'd do , upstairs , on the bare mattress with no sheets , with the windows all open , no breeze , and a fly buzzing faintly in one of the other rooms , one of the many empty other rooms . <p> I would sleep in that sun-filled room upstairs , groggy in the heat  --  sleeping a pure , happy , dreamless sleep  --  and then when it cooled down enough  --  around seven or eight in the evening  --  I 'd wake up and take my fly rod over to the other side of the meadow . It did n't get dark until midnight , in the summer . A spring creek wandered along the edge of that far meadow , and I 'd catch a brook trout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were too many fish in the little creek , and they were too easy to catch , so that after an hour or two I 'd get tired of catching them , and I 'd take the one I 'd decided to keep back to the cabin , and fry him for supper . <p> Then I would have to decide whether to read some more , or go for another walk , or to just sit on the porch with a drink in hand  --  just one big one  --  and watch the elk come out into the meadow . Usually I chose that last option  --  the one about the single big drink  --  and sometimes , while I was out on the porch , this great gray owl would come flying in from out of the woods . It was always a thrill to see it  --  that huge , wild , silent creature flying into my front yard . <p> The great gray owl 's a strange creature . It 's immense , and so shy that it lives only back in the oldest of the old-growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own great size against them . It sits very still for long stretches of time , back in the woods , motionless , watching for prey , until  --  so say the biologist  --  it believes it is invisible and a person or a deer can walk right past it  --  or can even walk right up to it  --  and so secure is the bird in its invisibility , its psychological cloak of being hidden , that it will not move even if you 're looking straight at it , it 's convinced you ca n't see it , and it wo n't blink , wo n't move . <p> Now that 's shy . <p> My job , my only job , was to live in the lodge , and keep intruders out . There had been a " For Sale " sign out front , but I 'd taken that down and hidden it in the garage the first day . <p> After a couple of years , Beauregard , the real killer , did sell the place , and was out of the picture . Pointy-toedZim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $350,000 a third of a million for some place with no electricity ! - but Quentin , the breaker of stocks , did n't buy it right away . He said he was going to buy it , the first day , the first five minutes he saw it  --  he took me aside and asked if I could stay on , and , like a true predator , I said , Hell yes . I did n't care who owned it , as long as I got to stay there , and as long as the owner lived far away , and was n't someone who would keep mucking up my life with a lot of visits . <p> Quentin did n't want to live there , or even visit  --  he just wanted to own it . He wanted to buy the place , but first he wanted to toy with Beauregard for a while , to try and drive the price down five or ten or twenty thousand ; he wanted to flirt with him , I think . <p> Myself , I would 've been terrified to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arms and legs ; he 'd been in foreign prisons , and had killed people . A bear had bitten him in the face on one of his hunts , a bear he 'd thought was dead . <p> Quentin and Zim would sometimes come out on " scouting trips , " that summer and fall that they were buying the place  --  Zim 's family back in Billings , and Quentin 's back in the Big Apple  --  and they 'd show up unannounced , with a bag of stupid groceries  --  Cheerios , and Pop Tarts , and hot dogs , and a big carton of Marlboro cigarettes  --  and they 'd want to stay for the weekend , to get a better " feel " for the place . I 'd have to move my stuff  --  sleeping bag , and frying pan , and fishing rod  --  over to the guest house , which was spacious enough . I did n't mind that ; I just did n't like the idea of having them in the house . <p> Once , while Quentin and Zim were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one of their dumb little sacks of groceries to see what stupid things they 'd brought this time , and a magazine fell out of one of the sacks  --  a magazine with a picture of naked men on the cover ; I mean , drooping penises and all , and the inside of the magazine was worse , with naked little boys , and naked men on motorcycles . <p> None of the naked men or boys were doing anything  --  they were n't touching each other  --  but still , the whole magazine , that part of it that I looked at , was nothing but heinies and penises . <p> Realtors ! <p> I 'd see the two old boys out on the front porch , the cabin all ablaze with light  --  those sapsuckers running my generator , my propane , far into the night , playing my Jimmy Buffett records , sitting out on the front porch and singing at the tops of their lungs  --  and and then finally , they 'd turn the lights off , shut the generator down , and go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little longer . I 'd sit on the porch of the guest house , at the other end of the meadow , my pups asleep at my feet , and I 'd see Quentin moving through the house , lighting the gas lanterns , walking from room to room , like a ghost , and then the son of a bitch would start having one of his fits . <p> He 'd break things  --  my things , and Beauregard 's things  --  though I suppose they were now his things , since the deal was in the works : plates , saucers , and lanterns , and windows . . . I 'd listen to the crashing ' of glass , and watch his big polar-bear whirling shape passing from room to room  --  sometimes he 'd have a pistol ( they both carried 9mm Blackhawks on their hips , like little cowboys )  --  and sometimes Quentin would shoot holes in the ceiling , holes in the walls . <p> I 'd tense , there in the dark .... This was n't good for my peace of mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and I wanted to defend them , and protect them , even if they were n't mine in the first place ; even if I 'd never owned them . <p> Then I 'd see , in that low lamplight , Zim come into the room . Like some old queen , he 'd put his arm around Quentin 's big shoulders , and lead him away , lead him to bed . <p> After they left , the house stank of cigarettes , and I would n't sleep in the bed for weeks . I 'd sleep in one of the many guest rooms . once I found some mouthwash spray under the bed , and pictured the two of them lying there in bed , spraying it into each other 's mouths in the morning , before kissing . . . <p> I 'm talking like a homophobe here . I do n't think it 's that at all . I think it was just that realtor . He was n't in it for the love . He was just turning a trick , was all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how shy he was  --  how he always tried to cover up his destruction  --  smearing wood putty into the bullet holes in the ceiling and mopping the food off of the ceiling  --  this fractured stockbrocker , doing domestic work  --  making lame excuses to me the next day about the broken glass  --  " I was shooting at a bat , " he 'd say , " a bat came in the window "  --  and all the while , Zim , in pursuit of that ten percent , would be sitting out on my porch , looking out at my valley this Billings person , from the hot , dry , dusty eastern part of the state  --  sitting there with his boots propped up on the railing and smoking the cigarettes that would not kill him quick enough . <p> Once , as the three of us sat there  --  Quentin asking me some questions about the valley , about how cold it got , in the winter ( " Cold , " I said , " very , very cold " )  --  we saw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of the day , across the meadow . <p> And Zim jumped up , seized a stick of firewood from the front porch ( my firewood ! ) and ran , in his dirty-diaper waddle , out into the filed after the mother coyote and pups , running like a madman , waving the club . The mother coyote got two of the pups into the trees , picking them up and carrying them by the scruff of their necks , but Zim , Zim got the third one , and stood over it , pounding , in the hot midday sun . <p> It 's an old story , but it was a new one for me  --  how narrow the boundary is between invisibility and collusion . If you do n't stop it , if you do n't single-handedly step up and change things , then are n't you just as guilty ? <p> I did n't say anything  --  not even when Zim came huffing back up to the porch , walking like a man who had just gone to get the morning paper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even then I said nothing . I did not want to lose my job . My love for this valley had me trapped . <p> We all three sat there on the porch like everything was the same  --  Zim breathing a bit more heavily , was all  --  and I thought I would be able to keep my allegiances secret , through my silence . But they knew whose side I was on . It had been revealed them . It was as if they had infrared vision , as if they could see everywhere  --  and everything . <p> " Coyotes eat baby deer and livestock , " said the raisin-eyed son of a bitch . " Remember . " he said , addressing my silence , " it 's not your ranch anymore . All you do is live here and keep the pipes from freezing . " Zim glanced over at his big soulmate . I thought how when Quentin had another crack-up and lost this place , Zim would get the ten percent again , and again and again , each time . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tell if he was angry with Zim or not . Everything about Quentin seemed hidden at that moment . How did they do it ? How could the sons of bitches be so good at camouflaging themselves when they had to ? <p> I wanted to trick them . I wanted to hide and see them reveal their hearts  --  I wanted to watch them when they did not know I was watching , and see how they really were-not just listen to them shooting the shit about their plans for the valley , but deeper . I wanted to see what was at the bottom of their black fucking hearts . <p> Finally Quentin blinked and turned calmly , still revealing no emotion , and gave his pronouncement . <p> " If the coyotes eat the little deers , they should go , " he said . " Hunters should be the only thing out here getting , the little deers . " <p> The woods still felt the same , when I went for my walks after the two old boys departed . Yellow tanagers still flitted through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deer were still tame . Ravens quorked as they passed through the dark woods , as if to reassure me that they were still on my side , that I was still with nature , rather than without . <p> I slept late . I read . I hiked . I fished in the evenings . I saw the most spectacular sights . Northern lights kept me up until four in the morning some nights-coiling in red-and-green spirals across the sky , exploding in iridescent furls and banners .... The northern lights never displayed themselves while the killers were there , and for that , I was glad . <p> In the late mornings and early afternoons , I 'd sit by the waterfall and eat my peanut-butter-and jelly sandwich . I 'd see the same magic sights : bull moose , their shovel antlers still in velvet , stepping over &lien,; rotting logs ; calypso orchids sprouting along the trail , glistening and nodding  --  but it felt , too , like the woods were a vessel , filling up with something of which they could only hold so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all they could , when they could hold no more , then things would change , and that wildness they could not hold would have to spill out , would have to go somewhere . . . <p> Zim and Quentin came out only two or three times a year , for two or three days at a time . The rest of the time , heaven was mine  --  all those days of heaven . You would n't think they could hurt anything , coming - tout so infrequently . But how little of a thing does it take to change  --  spoil  --  another thing ? <p> I 'll tell you what I think : The cleaner and emptier a place is , the less it can take . It 's like some crazy kind of paradox . <p> After a while Zim came up with the idea of bulldozing the meadow across the way , and building a lake , with sailboats and docks . He hooked Quentin up into a deal with a log-home manufacturer in the southern part of the state , and was going to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the lake . He was going to build a small hydro dam on the creek , and bring electricity into the valley with it , which would automatically double real estate values , Zim said . He was going to run cattle in the woods , lots of cattle . And set up a little gold mine operation , over on the north face of Roderick Butte . The two boys had folders and folders of ideas , plans . <p> They just needed a little investment capital , was all . <p> In the South , where I had come from , tenants held the power of a barnburning if their landlords got out of hand . Even a poor man or woman can light a match . But not here : a fire in this country would n't ever stop . <p> There seemed like there was nothing  --  absolutely nothing  --  I could do . Anything I did short of killing Zim and Quentin would be a token act , a symbol . Before I figured that out , I sacrificed a tree , chopped down a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cabin , doing great damage while Zim and Quentin were upstairs . I wanted to show them what a money sink the ranch was , and how dangerous it could be , and I told them how beavers , forest beavers , had chewed down that tree that had missed landing in their bedroom by only a few feet . <p> I know now that those razor-bastards knew everything ; they could sense that I 'd cut that tree . But for some crazy reason they pretended to go along with my story . Quentin had me spend two days sawing the tree up for firewood , and before he could get the carpenters out to repair the damage , a hard rain blew in and soaked some of my books . <p> I figured there was nothing I could do . Anything I did to harm the land or their property would harm me . <p> Meanwhile , the valley flowered . Summer came , stretched and yawned , and then it was early fall . Quentin brought his children out , early that second fall  --  the fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor did I spy any of the nekkid magazines . The kids  --  two teenage girls , and a teenage boy , a younger Quentin  --  were okay for a day or two ( the girls running the generator and watching movies on the VCR the whole day long ) , but the boy , little Quentin , was going to be trouble , I could tell  --  the first words out of his mouth when they arrived were " Is it any kind of . . . is there any season for . . . can you shoot anything right now ? Rabbits ? Marmots ? " <p> And sure enough , they made it two days before discovering there were fish  --  delicate little brook trout , with polka-dotted , flashy , colorful sides , and intelligent little gold-rimmed eyes , spawning on gravel beds in the shallow little creek that ran through the meadow on the other side of the road  --  and what Quentin 's son did , after discovering this fact , was to borrow his dad 's shotgun , and he began shooting the fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  it was a pump-action twelve gauge , like the ones used in big-city detective movies , and the motion was like masturbating  --  jack jack , boom jack , jack , boom  --  and little Quentin 's sisters came running out and rolled up their pants legs and waded out into the stream and began picking up the dead fish , and pieces of fish , and began eating those fish . <p> Quentin sat up on the porch with his drink in hand , and watched , smiling . <p> In the first week of November , while out walking  --  the skies that sweet , dull , purple lead color , and the air frosty , flirting with snow  --  I heard ravens , and then scented the newly dead smell of a kill , and moved over in that direction . <p> I saw the ravens ' black shapes taking flight up into the trees as I approached ; I could see the huge shape of what they 'd been feasting on  --  a body of such immensity that I paused , frightened , even though the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bull moose , their antlers locked up from rut-combat-the rut having been over for a month I knew  --  and I guessed they 'd been locked up for at least chat long . one moose was long-ago dead ( two weeks ? ) but the ocher moose had died so recently ( that morning , perhaps ) that he still had all his hide on him , and was n't even stiff . The ravens and coyotes had already done a pretty good job on the first moose , stripping what they could while his partner , his enemy , was thrashing and flailing , I could tell ; small trees and brush were leveled all around them , and I could see the swath , the direction from which they had come  --  locked-up floundering , fighting  --  to this final resting spot . <p> I went and borrowed a neighbor 's draft horse . The moose that had died just that morning was n't so much heavy as he was just big  --  he 'd lost a lot of weight during the month he 'd been tied up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ship of bones , mostly empty air . <p> Their antlers were locked together as if welded . I tied a big rope around the newly dead moose 's rear legs and got the draft horse to drag the cargo out of the woods and down through the forest , to the ranch . It was a couple of miles , and I walked next to the old draft horse , soothing him as he sledded , forty feet behind him , his strange load . Ravens flew behind us , cawing at our theft ; some of them filtered down through the trees and landed on top of the newly dead moose 's brave , humped back and rode along like that , pecking at the hide , trying to find an opening  --  but the hide was too thick , they 'd have to wait for the coyotes to open it  --  and so they rode with me like gypsies : myself , and the draft horse , and the ravens , and the dead moose ( as if they 'd come back to life ) moving through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the trees . <p> I hid the carcasses at the edge of the woods and then , on the other side of a small clearing , built a blind of branches and leaves where I could hide and watch over the carcasses . <p> I painted my face camouflage green and brown , and settled into my blind , and waited . <p> The next day , like buffalo wolves from out of the mist , Quentin and Zim reappeared . I 'd hidden my truck a couple of miles away and locked up the cabin so they 'd think I was gone . <p> I wanted to watch without being seen . I wanted to see them in the wild  --  wanted to see what they were like when humans were n't watching them . <p> " What the shit ! " Zim cried as he got out of his big mongo-tire Jeep , the one with the electric winch , electric windows , electric sunroof , electric cattle prod . Ravens were swarming my trap , gorging , and coyotes darted in and out , tearing at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and reveal the new flesh . <p> " Shit fire ! " Zim cried , running across the yard  --  hopping the buck-and-rail fence , his flabby ass getting caught astraddle the high bar for a moment . He ran out into the woods , shooing the ravens and coyotes . The ravens all screamed and rose into the sky as if caught in a huge tornado , as if summoned . Some of the bolder ones came back down and made passes at Zim 's head , but he waved them away , and shouted , " Shit fire ! " again , and then , examining the newly dead moose , said , " This meat 's still good ! " <p> Zim and Quentin worked by lantern light that night : peeling the hide back with butchering and skinning knives , and hacking at the flesh with hatchets . I stayed in the bushes and watched . The hatchets made whacks when they hit the flesh , and cracking sounds when they hit bone . I could hear the two men laughing . Zim reached over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cheeks , applying it like makeup , or medicine of some sort , and they paused , catching their breath from their mad chopping , and then they went back to work . They ripped and sawed slabs of meat from the carcass and hooted , cheering each time they pulled a leg off the carcass . <p> They dragged the meat up to the smokehouse  --  dragging it through the autumn-dead grass  --  and cut the head and antlers off last , right before daylight . <p> I hiked over and got my truck washed my face in a stream , and drove shakily home . <p> They waved when they saw me come driving up ; they were out on the front porch having breakfast , all clean and fresh-scrubbed . <p> I went up to the porch , where they were talking among themselves as they always had , talking as normal as pie . <p> Zim was lecturing to Quentin  --  waving his arm at the meadow and preaching the catechism of development to him . <p> " You could have a nice hunting camp and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a yellow slicker and a gun  --  boom ! They 're living the Western Experience . Then in the winter , you could run just a regular guest lodge , like on Newhart . Make ' em pay for everything . They want to go cross-country skiing ? Rent ' em . They want to race snowmobiles ? Rent ' em . Charge ' em for taking a piss . Rich people do n't mind . " <p> I was just hanging on : shaky . They finished their breakfast and went back inside to plot , or watch VCR movies . I went over to the smokehouse , and peered through the dusty windows . Blood dripped from the gleaming red hindquarters . They 'd cut the moose 's head off and nailed it , with the antlers , to one of the walls , so that his blue-blind eyes were looking out at his own corpse . There up into the woods . <p> But I knew I 'd come back . I liked living in that cabin , and liked living at the edge of chat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that evening , we were out on the porch again , watching the end of the day come-in-the days getting so much shorter  --  and Quentin and Zim were still pretending to be normal , still pretending chat none of the previous night 's savagery had happened . <p> It occurred to me that if they thought I had the power to stop them , they would have put my head in that smokehouse a long time ago . Would have put a baseball cap on my head , stuck a cigar in my mouth . <p> Quentin , looking especially burned out , had slipped from his chair . He was sitting on the floor with his back to the cabin wall , bottle of rum in hand , looking toward the meadow , where his lake and lots of cabins with lights burning in each of them would someday sit . I was just hanging around to see what was what , to eavesdrop , and to try to slow them down  --  to talk about those hard winters whenever I got the chance , and to mention how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , but hard to convince Quentin of , because every time he showed up , they got friendly . <p> " I 'd like that a lot , " said Quentin , speaking slowly . Earlier in the day I 'd seen a coyote , or possibly a wolf  --  sans pups  --  trot across the meadow , but I sure had n't pointed it to anyone . Even as we were sitting on the porch , there was the great gray owl  --  he 'd flown in like a plane , ghostly gray , a four-foot wingspan  --  perched on the falling-down buck-and-rail fence by the road . I had n't seen the owl in a couple of weeks , and I felt uneasy . It would be nothing for a man like Zim to walk up to that owl with his cowboy pistol , and put a bullet , point blank , into the big bird 's ear  --  the big bird with his eyes set in his face , looking straight at you , the way all predators do . <p> " I 'd like that so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of the lodge as a resort , in winter . He was wearing a gold chain around his neck , with a little gold pistol dangling from it . He 'd have to get rid of that necklace if he moved out here . It looked like something he might have gotten from a Cracker Jack box , but was , doubtless , real gold . <p> " It may sound corny , " Quentin said , " but if I owned this valley , I 'd let people from New York , from California , from wherever , come out here for Christmas and New Year 's . I 'd put a big sixty-foot Christmas tree in the middle of the road , up by the mercantile and the saloon , and string it with lights , and we 'd all ride up there in a sleigh , Christmas Eve and New Year 's Eve , and we 'd sing carols , you know ? It would be real small-town and homey , " Quentin said . " Maybe corny , but that 's what I 'd do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would pay through the nose for something like that , " he said . <p> We sat there and just watched the dusk gliding in over the meadow , cooling things off , blanketing the field 's dull warmth of the day and making mist and steam rise from the field . <p> Quentin and Zim were waiting for money , and Quentin , especially , was still waiting for his nerves to calm : almost a year he 'd owned the ranch , a full cycle of seasons , and still he was n't well . <p> A little something  --  peace ?  --  would do him good . I could see that Christmas tree all lit up ; I could feel that sense of community , of new beginnings . <p> I would n't go to such a festivity ; I 'd stay back in the woods , like the great gray . But I could see the attraction , could see Quentin 's need for peace ; how he had to have a place to start anew  --  though soon enough , too , I knew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Around midnight , I knew , he 'd take to smashing things  --  and I could n't blame him . Quentin was wild , and of course he wanted to come to the woods , too . <p> I did n't know if the woods would have him . <p> We sat there and watched dusk come sliding in . All I could do was wait . I sat very still , like that owl , and thought about where I could go next , after this place was gone . Maybe , I thought , if I sit very still , they will just go away . <p> <p> By Rick Bass <p>
