##@x <p> To the Editor : <p> " The Once and Future C.I.A . " ( editorial , Oct. 18 ) asserts the Central Intelligence Agency " has , at least to public perception , flunked . " To support this assertion , you suggest the agency failed to anticipate the fall of the Berlin Wall , Saddam Hussein 's aggression and the implosion of the Soviet Union . This portrayal of the agency 's performance is inaccurate , and does a disservice by furthering a perception that is flat-out wrong . <p> With respect to the Berlin Wall , the C.I.A . did draw policy makers ' attention in advance of its collapse to the possibility the embattled East German regime might have to dismantle it . But the wall was merely the most conspicuous symbol of a broader phenomenon  --  the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe  --  on which our analytic record is very good . Even before Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power in 1985 , we had pointed to the likelihood of political crisis in one or more East European states before the decade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gorbachev 's emergence as Soviet leader  --  and almost two years before the advent of democratic change in Poland  --  we foresaw in our assessments that Mr. Gorbachev 's policies were likely to destabilize Eastern Europe and lead to a dramatic turn of events there . On specific countries , we warned months in advance that the orthodox party leadership in Hungary would be swept aside , and that the Czechoslovak regime was increasingly vulnerable . We predicted Solidarity 's election victory in Poland and that full German unity would come much faster than most observers thought possible . <p> Concerning Saddam Hussein , the C.I.A . clearly warned of his potential for aggression . Longer-range estimates judged that the apparent restraint in Iraqi foreign policy following the war with Iran reflected the realities facing postwar Iraq rather than a fundamental shift in Saddam Hussein 's policies or regional ambitions . During the spring of 1990 we tracked Saddam Hussein 's increasingly threatening tone and behavior ; in the days leading up to the invasion of Kuwait we reported the buildup of Iraqi forces on the border , and we gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week before it occurred . <p> As for the " implosion of the Soviet Union , " the C.I.A . has been saying with increasing insistence since the late 1980 's that Mr. Gorbachev 's policies of half-way reform would not work . In examining the likely result of this failure , we posited scenarios ranging from reactionary retrenchment to a breakthrough by the democrats led by Boris N. Yeltsin . Even if there were a reactionary centralizing retrenchment , we said it would not be tenable as its leaders would lack a coherent program . <p> For a specific example , in April of this year  --  four months before the abortive coup in the Soviet Union  --  the C.I.A. , in a detailed , nine-page assessment entitled " The Soviet Cauldron , " explicitly said the Soviet empire and system of governance was breaking down , that " the centrally planned economy had broken down irretrievably " and that there was a " situation of growing chaos " in which " explosive events have become increasingly possible . " The C.I.A . assessment spelled out the possibilities in no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gorbachev , could judge that the last chance to act had come and move under the banner of law and order . " We specifically called attention to " a premeditated , organized attempt to restore a full-fledged dictatorship , " and noted that military , Ministry of Internal Affairs and K.G.B . leaders were " making preparations for a broad use of force in the political process . " <p> In this April assessment we characterized the long-term prospects of a reactionary coup in the Soviet Union as poor , and even short-term success as far from assured . In the longer term we said that " with or without Gorbachev , with or without a putsch , the most likely prospect for the end of this decade , if not earlier , is a Soviet Union transformed into some independent states and a confederation of the remaining republics , including Russia . " <p> The facts are there . The evidence is abundant . What is dismaying and disappointing is that too many people who ought to know better are popularizing the notion that C.I.A . has never got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' s performance based on the simplistic criteria of " success or failure " trivializes the contribution of intelligence to the understanding of issues . No one can predict the future precisely , and no organization is perfect , but C.I.A . ' s track record stands up to scrutiny  --  and our Congressional oversight committees provide it . I welcome that scrutiny and stand by our record . I commend it to those who , out of ignorance or malice , are so quick to disparage and dismiss the work this agency has done and is doing on the most complex and challenging issues of our time . RICHARD J. KERR Acting Dir. of Central Intelligence Langley , Va. , Oct. 18 , 1991 @@649977 Among Those That Know , a cabal our story will elucidate in the fullness of time , rumors fluttered that Dr. Obregon Petrie defied the laws of gravity when it suited his caprice . <p> Reports of Petrie in languorous flight through the velvet-shrouded parlors of his monstrous Victorian folly , of static levitation , even tales of Petrie clinging spiderlike to the plaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms , suffocated by curio cabinets and incunabula , were rife not only in the hushed confabulations of Those That Know , but a topic of idle gossip among the raucous sailors , coney-catchers , fishwives , and floozies who trolled Gin Lane and its tributary alleys at Land 's End . These were the human tidewash of any seafaring backwater , for whom no superstition is too far-fetched , and no inebriated fantasy fails to inspire lurid embellishment . <p> Petrie , airborne or otherwise , enjoyed much esteem at Land 's End , for the storm-ravaged shipping town 's human debris experienced no end of bleeding piles , recurrent malaria , scurvy , dropsy , high blood pressure , and a lowering effulgence of hardy pox , to say nothing of the port 's relentless pestilence of insomnia , a veritable miasmic funk endemic to the area since the wreckage , a century earlier , of The Ardent Somdomite . <p> Obregon Petrie possessed a maestro 's touch with most of the district 's repugnant , ever-recrudescent maladies , though his tinctures , creams , crystal amulets , cowpat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and like remedies provided little amelioration of the " waking dream " Land 's End drifted through each day until nightfall . <p> Only one of Dr. Petrie 's medicaments was known to relieve the diurnal somnolence and nocturnal abandon of his clientele . Alas , this balm came scarce and dear to the family exchequer , and was required for personal use by Dr. Petrie in such prodigious quantities that seldom could a drop be spared , even for those whose means might otherwise afford its purchase . <p> Since that long ago , mysterious collision of the Ardent with the archipelago of saber-toothed guano outcroppings beyond Zabriskie Harbor , the wags of neighboring Loch Stochenbaryl , East Clamcove , and Swill-upon-Mersey ( communities themselves notorious for the maniacal swiving of bovine herds and poachery of game hens ) cast withering execration upon our seaside enclave as " haunted . " <p> Land 's End 's denizens indeed excited alarm with their sleep-starved , hallucinatory revels at eventide . Yet aside from its reversal of the customary ordering of time , Land 's End was no better and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenue upon hard-drinking , brawlsome , lecherous dockworkers and sailors crowding their domains . <p> By day , Land 's End presented the chance traveller a dusty , unpeopled village , its serpentine lanes and ill-cobbled thoroughfares traversed by pariah dogs and an occasional disoriented porcupine or muskrat . At best , such a wayfarer might glimpse Dimitrios , the baker , who roused himself at cock 's crow to knead and yeast the town 's famous savory biscuits ; Humbolt , the butcher , might be visible through a scrim of turdlike , mauve and scarlet sausages pendant in his grimy window , slamming a razor-honed cleaver into pork loins and accordionlike sides of beef ; at Myshkin 's Confectioners , a jewel box of delectable , fruit-pimpled cakes and fragrant pies piped their siren aroma long hours before the wild , thistled hills behind Loch Stochenbaryl engorged the dissolute afterglow of dusk . <p> But the veins of these night-sleeping merchants ran with foreign blood . Their ways were not the town 's ways . They had suppurated from distant , oily realms , where barbarism waved its crude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruddy health seemed itself symptomatic of more furtive , hence more virulent inner riots of depravity . <p> Dimitrios was Greek , his ready smile unquestionably a pederastic leer ; Humbolt , East Prussian to the core , disported all the gruff , militaristic vulgarity of his ilk ; Myshkin , with his mincing feminate flourishes and constant stroking of his apron 's forepart , belonged to some obscurantist Christian sect , or worse . His shanty , perched amid the phosphorescent lichen beds of Mica Slide , featured weeping icons and statuettes of apocryphal-sounding saints and starets , whom the few who 'd ever ventured there presumed to be satanic fetishes and hoodoo simulacra of the townsfolk . <p> The ululating tongues of Gin Lane asserted that Myshkin 's piety dissembled a cunning , avaricious Jew behind the confectioner 's sugar with which he was usually festooned , that the dough of his cakes and eclairs was kneaded with the blood of Christian infants , and that his annual vacations were furtive trips to the Bilderberg Meetings , whose members rule the world sub rosa . <p> Such , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorant townsfolk . A few of us who lived at Land 's End - not Those That Know , whose impenetrable secrecy concealed their very identities , but those of us , I mean to say , who knew Petrie-were acquainted with another side of the distinguished doctor , for Petrie 's familiars regularly gathered in his rooms for evenings of bezique and the requisite blinis and caviar , washed down with flutes of French champagne , to which Petrie treated us when , almost every week , as he put it , his " ship came in ahead of schedule . " What ship that was , the townspeople knew not ; the Chinese coolies at the docks , however , who whiled their sparse hours ' reprieve from herniating labor and the cruel lash of the harbormaster 's bullwhip in Gin Lane 's crapulous warrens of aromatic lassitude , knew Petrie 's vessel well . But these prematurely wizened , cryptic Orientals kept their buccal orifices zipped for all but the insertion of the succoring pipe . <p> The motley of Petrie 's acquaintances included Khartovski , a former Marxist-Leninist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Economics , which had done nothing to relieve his chronic penury . Khartovski 's elongated , boneless form , its head resembling a speckled egg sprouting two taut braids of chin-length moustache , habitually draped itself athwart Petrie 's green and beige striped sofa . <p> Sporadically , as if recalling in his cups the sylvan highlands and dales of an imaginary youth ( Khartovski hailed , if that is the term , from a nameless Crimean obscurity ) , he declaimed Odes and Lays of the Robert Burns and Ettrick Shepherd variety in a guttural Russian accent . <p> Marco Dominguez , a Cameroonais of anthracite coloration , forever in demand for impromtu , unpaid repair work by Land 's End 's ennui-stricken grass widows , invariably joined us for bezique and regaled us with tales of bygone wildlife encounters and trophy maidenheads acquired in the bush . This nobly-hewn African TmigrT had amassed a fortune in small arms deals at the precocious age of twenty-two . <p> It was said that Marco could assemble a Kalashnikov from scattered parts in the time it takes a teakettle to raise a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempted in the rough-and-tumble sinkhole of our seaside purgatory , for lack of a kinder term . Marco , whose bearing suggested that of a tribal prince , wished to live the retiring life of an English gentleman from the Edwardian era , despite his much-sought , reputedly enormous dexterity and insatiable appetite for minor household repairs . <p> Another of Petrie 's callers , Dr. Philidor Wellbutrin , was a rotund , excessively flatulent , puff-eyed OB/GYN ( such , at least , was the euphemism active among the town 's tarts and ostensibly virginal , unmarried daughters ) , whose ungovernable mane of flame red hair matched a ready tongue as fiery as his whorling tresses . <p> Petrie 's salon further included Colecrupper , the local auto mechanic , an autodidact of vast pretentions and meager learning . These evening hands of bezique were further enlivened by visits from Thalidomido , a bow-legged , Umbrian dwarf , whose head followed the contour of a Bartlett pear , his torso that of a Bose stereo speaker . The soul of gaiety at Petrie's-save during cyclical spells of depressive rage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital , and reportedly terrorized its abject staff of " little people " with asperities and cutting personal remarks , alternating with melancholic , tearful vows to hurl himself from Strumpet Margot 's Cliff , a crumbling extrusion of laterite on the edge of the lower town . Strumpet Margot had been driven to her end by a cavalry officer of wretched morals ; the edge of the abyssal drop that bore her name was a favored setting for moonlight picnics and for carnal liaisons in motor vehicles whose owners Colecrupper derived tart , sanctimonious glee from identifying by their license plate numbers . <p> I do not suggest that I was Petrie 's sole confidante , though because I rented a suite of rooms on his topmost floor , I " knew him " better than others . I did , in truth , pass greater time in Petrie 's company than they , being young and , some said , comely as a rogue yet shy as a peacock hen , as I am afflicted with a speech disorder of a mortifying nature , and , as Petrie often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and full of dreamy fancies . " I was , in consequence , " more privy " ( a locution I found particularly unfortunate , though the doctor intended a single entendre ) to an occluded side of his existence . <p> With regard to many , though hardly all matters , the category of " confidante " would have encompassed much of Land 's End and its periphery . Petrie could keep practically nothing to himself , even when discretion strongly recommended otherwise . <p> We card partners were hardly unaware that Petrie 's " miracle remedy " for the town 's primary ailment was clove-flavored tincture of laudanum , upon which Petrie himself had a punishingly copious dependence . <p> The realm of murk I alluded to just now , which Petrie kept truly secret , comprises much of my story here . He kept this realm sealed off from his other intimates and everyone for the excellent reason that his life depended on it-certain episodes of which , based entirely on the doctor 's ipsissima verba , I record here , perhaps to no great purpose . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
