JAMES HAD NEVER KILLED an animal before . There were other facts he could have been wrestling but this one found him on his back porch at twilight , head at a thoughtful angle , thumbnail between his teeth . His hands smelled of the soap he 'd used at the hospital , of the paper greens he 'd worn , of the mask ; smelled of the essence of illness itself , which he believed to be fear , and not at all of his wife . Surely he 'd struck an animal on the road ? For he 'd driven countless vehicles , in the country and without caution , for over thirteen years . But nothing came to him , no jackrabbit , no snake , not one worthless grackle , a bird he might have killed without remorse . <p> He 'd never hunted either and yet , as of this afternoon , he owned a gun . Driving home from the airport , he had stopped at the garish turquoise building whose excited sigu  --  GUNS ! AMMO ! BEER !  --  had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when searching it out . The proprietor had been held up and shot with one of his own handguns not too long ago , a bullet through the lung , he told James . Just made him mad . But he kept his eye on James , possibly thinking James 's complete ignorance in the line of firearms suspicious . It was rural New Mexico , after all , and men owned guns . <p> Another thing , James thought , removed from the porch , past the can-opening routine that marked his recent meal-making , now eating his dinner in front of the television : he 'd never fired a gun . He had studied the act , indirectly and repeatedly , via TV but had never to his knowledge taken a gun in his hands , wrapped his finger around a trigger . His parents were pacifists ; he 'd been ten years too young for Vietnam . He hesitated , holding his soupspoon above the bowl , cocking his head and staring upward and to his right , the same pose he 'd assumed earlier on the porch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take when trying to remember the past . This was something about Dee : her ability to make him self-conscious , like a hidden camera . She studied him and then fed him her findings . He was , she let him know , curious though worthy material . James stared purposefully down , into the floating debris of his soup . There was no gun he could recall . <p> The secondhand shotgun lay , for lack of a better place , on the couch beside him . He had tossed it there trying to make it appear natural in his home , like a sweaty hat . Dee hated guns , had not long ago planted a homemade anti-NRA signboard in the front yard which had been promptly shot full of holes . Now the bravest of her stray toms suddenly jumped to a cushion , startling James , and sniffed along the instrument that tomorrow would be used to kill him . <p> " What do you think , Cat ? " James squeaked and so had to clear his throat and repeat the question calmly . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals , either , another aberration Dee would have pointed out to him if she 'd been home . <p> They were bad farmers , not really farmers at all , their garden eaten by rabbits , their chickens overrunning the outbuildings because Dee had declared herself and James extreme vegetarians , unwilling to consume animals or their byproducts . So eggs were permitted to hatch . Coyotes , perhaps hawks , served to thin the group . James and Dee had come to the country first generation , both raised in suburban Houston , where crows and giant cockroaches constituted wildlife . They had bought a small cotton and pecan farm and allowed the meager acreage to take its own course . Tumbleweeds now filled the untilled cotton fields ; the pecan trees bloomed and dropped their husky nuts and spread their summer canopy without interference . The county provided irrigation water which James could not remember to take advantage of . Both he and Dee worked in El Paso , across the New Mexico state line thirty miles south . They were happy enough to come home at night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James had always associated with longing-coyotes , the relentless wind , train whistles and the accompanying clack of wheels  --  except , could it be longing , if he was here ? Their animals accumulated as strays will , sent packing by intolerant adjoining farms , adopted by Dee , who turned each into a character , comical , harmless . Soon they owned a self-destructive goat who ate not only feed dishes and barbed wire but her own fur as well , her rump as bare and smooth as a human 's , prone to eczema . She would ram her head into a wall until she passed out . From the litters of skinny cats in the fields , Dee fed kittens who became older and less wild , who soon moved under the house and then in . The chickens had begun with a single hen who 'd walked up their washboard road one morning ( " Like some old white-trash church lady , " Dee laughed ) , fat and insolent , and had stayed , content by herself in the tin outbuilding , wandering only often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick empire of chicks . <p> The peacocks , two arrogant fellows who lived to outshine each other , had been won in a small town raffle . Dee had a habit of winning prizes . They strutted , they preened , they presented their butts as if withholding the superior beauty of their plumage . Dee exalted in their cockiheSS , their purely natural conceit . <p> But she loved them all , without favorites , like children , loved to create their tales and salve their infections . It was her nature to rescue things , James came to understand . She kept a cardboard box of veterinary supplies beneath the bathroom sink , and more than once he had heard her through the closed bathroom door , convincing an unwilling animal to let her render aid . <p> In the morning it was the goat James decided to sacrifice first . She was a loud nervous beast , large enough to make James uncomfortable at the prospect of her watching him slaughter the rest . He led her into the pecan grove , over the cracked topsoil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , the kind of day Dee would have announced by saying , " I hate the wind . " The trees ' shadows , bending , frightened the goat ; she balked at his lead . Or perhaps he put off some odor of desperation . James certainly felt desperate , and he was sweating heavily , the hand holding the shotgun slick . <p> Dee had been away so long now that James had grown used to mourning her absence ; it was practice for her death , which was coming , a heavy blanket worn over his shoulders . At first it had been worse , more sharp and random , prodding him when he was most vulnerable . But now loss simply characterized him . He was thin and unhappy ; his house seemed sinister , the landscape malevolent . Moving from morning to night , he felt his own will tested . Dee would die , he knew that , though no one would say as much . A sterile home would prolong her passing . She came to him in small , tenuous images . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ islands of her pink flesh , breasts and belly and splayed knees . Dee disparaging the local newspaper . Dee sitting against the south side of the house , sunbathing , her face held up to the light , and afterwards , sunburned , James tamping pungent Noxema over her shoulders while she winced . <p> Superseding these images , however , was the more concrete one of Dee in a hospital bed . It seemed to James that merely being there had made her twice as sick . From nowhere and for no good reason , she 'd begun fainting , exhaustion coming on her so quickly she sometimes could not make it to a chair or bed . She 'd always had headaches but she started suffering migraines , spent hours at a time weeping with pain . Between attacks were whole days she walked delicately through the house , her neck held as if her head might tumble off . Then she would be subsumed once more . Pain had turned her ugly , impatient . The peacocks ' noise made her shriek in fury . James once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cheeks , fighting what hurt her . The next day she 'd had two black eyes . <p> They had loved their quaint and endearing rural life , treating it ironically and with good humor , but James suddenly felt enraged with local doctors and the slow resignation they offered in response to her complaints . Dee , afraid of the worst , pretended for a time to believe them , that she needed rest more than anything . <p> Eventually a hematologist was consulted , and then an oncologist in El Paso , who sent her to Albuquerque and then Phoenix . James had just returned from seeing her yet felt as distant as ever . Each transfer had taken her farther away from him , from their marriage , their home , from health . She 'd even left her friendly name behind , now called Deirdre . What remained of her seemed to grow transparent , like a healing burn . <p> James tethered the goat to a tree at the far end of the grove . The Rio Grande passed not far from where he stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mosquitoes kept landing on his neck . He lifted the shotgun awkwardly under his armpit , elbow cocked in a clumsy position , and aimed at the goat 's head , which was lowered as she tried busily to pull free of the rope . She was stirring up dust , braying , and James decided just to kill her fast . " I 'm sorry , " he told her , though she paid no attention to him , " but you 're dirty . " He fired and fell on his ass . The goat 's first reaction was to sit on her bare haunches , too , as if to join him on the ground . Then she dropped her head , which hung unnaturally stretched and slack over the rope . Her front legs had not buckled , still stood rigid . James began crying when her eyes blinked open . He aimed again but the gun 's trigger would not budge . He hammered the safety with his palm , whacked the barrel on a tree , then aimed once more , this time at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trigger , missing the goat , who , during James 's panic , had died , still sitting up . <p> He had not thought about what to do with her body . Or any of the bodies , he realized , walking back to the house . He was hot and sickened but also exhilarated from adrenaline , from his sense of making progress . When he 'd asked Dee 's doctor what he could do , he was told to sanitize her home environment . She would be susceptible to any passing illness . Immediately James pictured germs the precise size of ticks and mites and fleas , the animals ' combined stench alone enough to kill her . It was this image that had fortified him to shoot the goat , to take the first step . But it had not occurred to him how to get rid of the goat 's large body . He was proceeding without any practicality , he realized , like walking blindfolded . It was Dee , six months older than he , who had set the tone of their married life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking what came their way without prolonged deliberation . <p> After lunch he drove his car around the perimeter of the grove to where the goat still sat , head dangling as if hanged . Flies swarmed at the entrance points of the spray of pellets and at her open eyes . James put his hand to his turning stomach . He could not guess how to continue , Dig a hole ? But it would have to be six feet long , probably six feet deep , and the earth , unwatered , would not give in easily to a shovel . He considered renting a backhoe , but operating one was another in an ever growing list of things he 'd never before done . For a second genuine despair overtook him : he was ill prepared for what he had to endure ! It was not fair , to be so completely unqualified ! <p> Again he smelled the foul Rio Grande . Behind the seat in his car he had brought his shotgun , as if he might have cause to defend himself . He stood until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until his necessary maturity caught up with him , then hit upon a solution . <p> He returned to the house for rope and , finding none , settled on three leather belts from his closet . Back at the dead goat , he cut her from the tree , fashioned a kind of harness with the belts around her front legs and chest , then tied the lead rope to his small bumper . Across the empty field south of his grove he dragged the animal , careful to move so slowly there would be no chance of the rope 's breaking or the car 's bellying out . He longed now for a rugged truck instead of his old 280Z , the one Dee called " the Penis Car . " He watched the goat in the rearview mirror , on her side , front legs erect with rigor mortis . Beyond her , behind the car perhaps two miles , diesels passed on the interstate , big shiny rectangles moving neatly across the desert to El Paso . James stopped at the river and wondered what he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car door and surveyed the water , which was now at its highest level , though it moved like lava , slow and brown and hot . He hauled the goat himself , dragged her across the broken beer bottles and desert scrub down to the muddy bank . There she stuck and James lost a shoe pulling his own feet from the slog . Tumbleweeds floated by , soda pop and motor oil cans . The water at the bank was shallow enough that James had to push the goat 's body away , lying prone in the water himself until the current finally caught her . <p> At home the peacocks rested on the porch railing like decoys , eyes in slits . This was the last he would see of them . James showered . Afterwards he found coarse white goat hairs in the tub 's drain screen which he flushed down the toilet . Instead of getting on with the chore , James sat in the living room smoking pot . He 'd given this up more than a year ago , when Dee had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shaking in his hands . The stash he 'd kept in the freezer was stale and tasted like burning oregano . He got high anyway and watched the dying sunlight turn the room a sentimental yellow . Pot made him melancholy and hungry . He wished to be in a scene of ordinary past , Dee slicing tomatoes and peppers and onions , crying from the odors , he poking the bobbing ears of corn into boiling water . Dee 's oaky hair had been long and too thin , hanging down her back in a fringey V , reaching just to the two dimples of her extremely wide hips . She was flat-chested and big-bottomed , called most of her life " the Gourd " by her brothers . She wore sundresses and went braless , her big strong calves rippling where her hemline stopped . Eye makeup was the only concession she made toward modifying herself , blue mascara , blue eyeliner , blue eyeshadow , the rest of her face freckled and ruddy , her eyes , she was convinced , too small . <p> James thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either side of her bony ribcage , an areola of pale downy hair around each . The only good thing about pregnancy , Dee had supposed meditatively to James one evening after sex , was that it might give some bust to her bust . But there had been no children , and now there never would be . It was possible she would die before the year finished , before they both turned twenty-nine . <p> Sometimes he gave in , weakened by the effort of keeping his thoughts pure , to the fantasy of another woman , a healthy woman . When he 'd married Dee , his sister told him he 'd made a mistake , that Dee was cold , dedicated to negativity . She 'd predicted that it would n't work out and now , when James looked into the future , he thought of his sister 's words as prophetic , saw himself with his next wife , the true wife , a woman he would know more profoundly than Dee , having lived with her longer , among children , no doubt . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character Dee would become . He indulged this fantasy with only half his mind , the other half experiencing acute shame . There was some relief in imagining that Dee had been nothing more than a detour , that the future lay ahead , refreshingly far from the way he felt now . But he always came back , always came crashing head first to the here and now . <p> Just as James passed into the dreamless sleep he 'd smoked himself toward , he remembered he 'd left the shotgun in the Z , the doors of both the car and the house unlocked , lights blazing . Come and get me , he thought . <p> The smell of cat urine woke him . Sunday . Overhead a light burned palely in the sunshine from the east window . Birds twittered . On the cookie sheet on the coffee table the remaining marijuana bud looked like a scorpion . She would be home Tuesday , flown from Phoenix to El Paso , driven to her house by medical personnel . James had dredged up some lost bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service . " Actually , it 's self-protection , " the man had admitted . " Once she 's out of our hands , there 's nothing you can hold us responsible for . " The tom Dee had named Opie licked himself sullenly at James 's feet . He was orange and nearly always had somewhere a pusfilled infection from fights . Dee liked to open such wounds , using a sterile razor . An ear had been torn halfway off in a terrible scramble just a few months ago , giving Opie the lopsided look of a brain-damaged boxer . The urine smell propelled James from the couch and to the car , where he picked up the gun without taking time to feel its cool , dewy metal bulk in his hands . The cat had followed him as far as the porch door , and James took the opportunity to fire , recognizing the error of this instantly . <p> His ears rung with the gun 's report , and he walked up the porch steps with a sense of unreality . The birds had hushed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point where his front legs tapered down . One leg had been blown off , on the same side of the body as the torn ear , James noted . He stood sweating over the carnage , fur and blood and the leg 's bone . It was seeing the concentric cross section of layers  --  fur , flesh , muscle , bone , and , finally , the small inner spore of marrow  --  that gave him stomach enough to clean the mess . He soaked the porch with water , then let the hose run into a patch of dry ground behind the chicken shed . When the earth was saturated , he dug a hole in the mud and , using a broad-ended shovel , brought the shattered cat to his grave . <p> Wiser , he soaked the ground and dug another hole , larger than the first , and put a makeshift barricade around it using sawhorses and blankets . Into this he threw all the chickens but Church Lady , who would not let him near her . The peacocks had disappeared , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found himself both disappointed and relieved that he would not have a chance to blast their plucky , impertinent beauty . <p> He fired at the pit of chickens to shut them up , their hysteria shrill and childlike , fired until all movement ceased , removed the sawhorses and threw on dirt , stomped over it until the mound was solid . He shot the remaining hen on the run , down the road she 'd arrived on . Too weak to dig another hole , he dropped her in a pile of old tires , covered her with a hill of rocks and left her beside the driveway . <p> He realized one death made the next one easier , one killing leading more easily to another  --  shooting the chickens had reminded him of a carnival game  --  this massacre giving him the stamina to find the last cats , the three who had hidden after Opie 's death . Their mistrust of him , their unwillingness to be coerced from the cool crawlspace beneath the house , built his sense of its being a fair hunt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He killed them without pity , one shot each , killed them and felt Dee that much closer to coming home . <p> James had gone gratefully to work on Monday , had purchased Clorox and Comet and industrial-sized sponges afterwards and headed to the farm for the much simpler task of washing down the house . He was just outside the small town of Anthony , smiling to himself , remembering Dee 's constant argument that he never helped with housekeeping , when a black-and-white dog dashed from the road 's shoulder and was under James 's front wheels before he realized it . He felt the animal pass under his feet , like a lump beneath a rug , then saw it land on the opposite shoulder . He lurched to a stop , the engine dying , and watched in the rearview . The dog did not move . Dee had never brought home a dog , a fact for which James suddenly felt enormous gratitude . Could he have intentionally killed a dog ? On the highway shoulder he waited for someone to come claim the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come running from the poor adobe house in the distance . But nothing stirred except the wind . He let loose the steering wheel and looked at his hands as if for blood . <p> When Dee phoned from Phoenix he was high again . Immediately he understood she could not discover this . <p> " So , " he said , " everything friendly ? " <p> Dee had acute myeloblastic leukemia , which had entered the bone marrow and turned it black . Or so James pictured it . The disease itself sounded like a weapon from a comic book . " Imagine little ray guns in your blood , " he had suggested when the doctors encouraged Dee to use visualization . " Myeloblasters . " <p> " I hate guns , " was her response . <p> She 'd had chemotherapy just to prepare her for the more difficult procedure of a marrow transplant . This new fluid , from her terrified younger brother , might save her but only if her body were completely amenable to hosting it . <p> " Not exactly unfriendly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fever and everyone keeps whispering ' not pneumonia ' like a prayer . I 'm supposed to picture beautiful butterflies helping the transplant , I guess the same ones that were supposed to eat the leukemia cells . Not like they did such a great job of that , either . I think my imagination fell out with my hair . " <p> James stood at the kitchen phone taking note of all he had to do . This dirt , like the animals , had come to equal Dee 's disease , something to be forced from his life , the more thoroughly  --  the more violently  --  the better . " I guess I 'm going to start cleaning up a little , " James told her . " Scrape off the sheets and erase the plates . Ha , ha . " <p> Dee snorted . " I 'm so sick of this fucking place , " she said suddenly . " I 'm so sick of being sick , I could die . " <p> He worked that night like a man possessed , first trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , later simply ripping up the yellow shag carpeting and , using a serrated bread knife , hacking it into chunks small enough to burn in the metal trash cans . After midnight he stood overseeing the fire he 'd filled with his and Dee 's unsanitary belongings , the smoke laced with the smell of the rug 's rubber backing . He 'd returned to the Rio Grande and tossed in the gun , followed with the leftover ammunition . It was primitive , this purging and burning and washing , but he believed it would free him . He even threw into the fire his aged marijuana and did not inhale the smoke . The house smelled so strongly of chlorine bleach , its stark cleanliness was so daunting , he decided to sleep outside . He lay in a sleeping bag watching the flames die . Some last bit of burning cloth floated in the hot air , a little brilliant chink against the night , light and languid . Watching it until it landed on the ground , safely extinguished , James saw the red eyes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly , peacock , hidden down in the shadows of the overgrown cotton field , looking at him . <p> She came home in a private ambulance , sterile all the way , deposited with care by two young men whose responsibility for her wellbeing ended at her own front door . They approached , one at each of her elbows , masks beneath their noses . James wore his , his wife hers , as well as a white turban wrapped round her bald head . It could have been a scene from a movie about the future , when the air is poisonous and resourceful humans have erected clear bubbles over their plots of lifesustaining land . <p> " Easy , " he said to her , steering her to the porch swing . <p> " Home , " she said , crying suddenly . " I 'd rather die than leave here again . " Of course , she could only pretend she had this option . Her chance.of survival had been eaten away like a deficit pie : from the sixty percent leukemia presented , twenty percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , if they were lucky . James had never been good at fractions , or at numbers at all . There was n't much he was good at . He thought he 'd been a pretty fair husband . Now he made his wife sit in the swing while he stood behind her and gently pushed . She was no longer Dee , he thought , her hair and heft gone , her gait timid and trembling , her insides radiated , expunged , replaced  --  and perhaps he would not have her long enough to discover who she had become . <p> James watched the ambulance roll slowly down the dirt road , sensing that its disappearance also marked the end of the lifeline , monitored night and day , that had kept his wife , himself , tied to procedure and authority . It was not until the vehicle 's brake lights flashed one final time at the intersection of their driveway and the county road  --  a startling blast of red  --  that James realized his mistake of the last few days . Behind his mask his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward him , and he squeezed them as he pushed her . <p> Unbidden , the faces of a dozen people came to him , people who might have taken a neurotic goat , wild cats , chickens . The names of his neighbors reached him as if sung by an angel : McNeil , Tuft , Gutierrez , Gerard . <p> Stunned , he met Dee 's eyes  --  so unnaturally , radiantly blue , housed as they were between the screaming white of her mask and turban  --  as she turned to face him . Just before she asked him , " Where are the animals ? " he understood he might not ever convince her , he might not ever understand , himself , truthfully . He would live longer than she , and so have the opportunity to wonder at it for many years ; he would never view peacocks without a certain unease . He 'd killed her animals . But never once , until this moment , did it occur to him that there was any other way . He had only done what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NELSON <p>
