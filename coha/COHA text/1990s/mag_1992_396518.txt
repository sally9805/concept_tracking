Celebrity guru and best-selling author Marianne Williamson brings love , forgiveness and a chorus of recrimination to Hollywood The cavernous hangar at the Santa Monica airport has been transformed on this fall evening into a glittering AIDS-benefit charity auction called Divine Design . Madonna 's corset from her Blond Ambition tour and the leather jacket worn by Arnold Schwarzenegger in Terminator II are among the donated items on the block ; Elizabeth Taylor , Anjelica Huston and Daryl Hannah are part of the star-studded turnout . But even in the midst of all this Hollywood glamor , the real star of the event is a diminutive woman with flawless skin and angular features . The crowd applauds warmly as Marianne Williamson steps to the podium , then it hushes for her exhilarating speech about the powers of love and forgiveness , and at the conclusion erupts in thunderous ovation . But as Williamson makes her way out of the spotlight and off the stage , she seems not to hear the accolade , and at least several in the gathering are witness to a quite different side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " she barks , pushing toward the back of the audience . " What was that ? " she hisses , launching into a tirade directed at her audio-visual crew . " I told you ! " The evenings slide presentation , a depiction of seriously ill AIDS patients , was , it seems , not " uplifting " enough . At the age of 39 , Marianne Williamson has become Hollywood 's most compelling  --  and perplexing  --  spiritual guide since Werner Erhard swept through Tinseltown with his est movement in the 1970s . Lest there be any doubt , consider her credentials : Last October , Williamson officiated at the California wedding of Larry Fortensky and Elizabeth Taylor , who says that Williamson 's " sense of spirituality triggered off my own . " Actresses Raquel Welch and Rosanna Arquette , as well as Cher , are among the thousands who have flocked to her quasireligious new-age lectures on both coasts . Lesley Ann Warren calls Williamson " a pal . " Comedian Louie Anderson and Kim Basinger serve on the honorary board of one of her charitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support , helping Williamson raise more than $1.5 million to date for her work against AIDS . Barbra Streisand is said to have taken an interest in her teachings . Other publicity-shy stars reportedly listen at home to her 50 inspirational audio tapes on subjects ranging from " Forgiving Your Parents " to " Death Does Not Exist . " This month her just published inspirational guide , A Return to Love ( launched with a Hollywood book party given by Norman Lear ) , hit the top of the New York Times ' self-help bestseller list . And with Williamson as a guest on her Feb. 4 talk show , Oprah Winfrey , who bought 1,000 copies to distribute to her studio audience , gave the volume an unabashed plug . " I have never been as moved by a book , " she told viewers , " as I have by Marianne Williamson 's book . " Along with her message , the foundation of Williamson 's mass appeal is a network of charitable organizations deeply involved in the fight against AIDS . Her Project Angel Food , founded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homebound AIDS patients in Los Angeles . Her two nonprofit Manhattan and L.A. Centers for Living ( founded with the help of $100,000 in donations from entertainment mogul David Geffen ) provide a range of services  --  from housecleaning to meditation and massage . In private life , Williamson , a self-described " unwed Jewish mother , " shares a smallish two-bedroom Hollywood apartment with her 22-month-old daughter , India Emmaline ( whose father she refuses to identify or discuss ) , and drives a battered seven-year-old Peugeot . She takes no salary from her organizations but lives on book royalties and her lectures ' $7-ahead ( $10 in New York ) " suggested contributions . " Her celebrity connections , she modestly implies , are little more than happenstance . " Meeting someone in Hollywood who is in the entertainment business , " she says , " is like meeting someone in Houston in the oil business . How do you avoid it ? " Yet beneath the glowing surface of Williamson 's spiritual domain , there are growing undercurrents of dissension and mistrust . A number of sources , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Williamson 's offstage displays of temper and unchecked ego , as well as a cruelly abrasive management style , are alienating her allies , giving credibility to her detractors and , most damaging of all , beginning to undermine the basis of financial support for her legitimate  --  and vital  --  charity work . " Marianne is a tyrant . She 's cruel  --  unnecessarily  --  and very controlling , " says one former associate . " It does n't mean that her works are n't great . They are . But her own ego is going to destroy her . " Among the developments that have most rankled insiders were the disappointing profits of the Divine Design auction . Expected to generate something like $2 million , it netted only $725,000 . The reason , say her critics , was Williamson 's micromanagement of the event . Potential profits were eaten away , they say , by Williamson 's insistence on such questionable amenities as air-conditioning for the hangar . Other criticism centers on her high-handed management . Last year , in a dispute over the Manhattan Center for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board members , including film director Mike Nichols , who went on to create a rival AIDS support organization . In L.A. , Williamson 's 20-member Center for Living staff rebelled last month after the firing of the center 's fourth director in five years , popular local politician Steve Schulte , who had clashed frequently with Williamson over business strategy . Some employees are attempting to unionize  --  in an effort , they say , to protect themselves from Williamson 's bad-tempered caprices . Her treatment of other loyal employees has also caused grumbling in the ranks . One staffer , the Manhattan Center 's board director , Regina Hoover , was put on probation with Williamson 's consent last year  --  one week before Hoover 's scheduled double mastectomy . A short time after her surgery , Hoover was fired , then forced to haggle for months over the terms of her medical insurance . " Marianne 's ego is all over the place , " says a worker at the L.A. Center for Living , who wishes to remain anonymous . " When she 's mad , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've seen her reduce a volunteer worker to tears and swearing that he 'd never come back . " Since a story critical of Williamson 's abrasiveness appeared in the Feb. 16 Los Angeles Times , at least one individual donor and one corporate donor say they have suspended financial contributions , and several demoralized Project Angel Food volunteers had to be dissuaded from resigning . Not long before that story 's publication , Williamson warned her staff not to speak to reporters . Her words , according to witnesses : " You 're f  --  ing with my livelihood . I 'm famous  --  I do n't need this , damn it ! " In public , a number of colleagues believe , Williamson 's charismatic lecturing is increasingly undercut by her conduct . At one high-profile Hollywood party last February , Williamson pleaded with her friend and backer , producer-manager Sandy Gallin , to introduce her to Dolly Parton and Shirley MacLaine . Teasing her , Gallin recited in a singsong voice , " Dolly , this is Marianne . Shirley , this is Marianne . " Within earshot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F  --  off , Sandy ! " before storming away . From an early age , Williamson was used to going  --  and getting  --  her own way . Her brand of eclectic spiritualism was shaped in Houston , where she grew up the youngest of three children of Sam Williamson , a crusty political liberal and immigration lawyer , and his homemaker wife , Sophie Ann . ( Older sister Jane teaches at an Episcopal school in Houston , where older brother Peter is an immigration lawyer . ) " Marianne grew up around this stuff , " says Sam , 82 , pulling volumes of Thomas Aquinas , the Koran and a Hebrew New Testament from his law-office shelf . Early on , Marianne developed her own relationship with a higher power . " When she was a baby of 3 or so , I would come in to kiss her goodnight , " says Sophie Ann . " Half the time she 'd be sitting in her bed with her eyes closed and her little hands clasped under her chin , and she 'd say , " Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " She also had a precocious sense of the theatrical . " I used to do a lot of pretending I was Eleanor Roosevelt , " Williamson says , remembering how she wondered if the First Lady 's homeliness diminished her impact as a committed humanitarian . " I kept thinking , " Could makeup have made a difference ? ' " After graduating from Houston 's Bellaire High School , Williamson put in two years studying theater and philosophy at Pomona College in Claremont , Calif . " Marianne was always picking up stray mystics , " says her Pomona roommate Lynda Obst , now a film producer . " A part of her was always looking for something electric in life . " In 1973 , Williamson moved to New York City to pursue a career as a cabaret singer . There she fell into months of deep depression after her breakup with a boyfriend . Rock biographer Albert Goldman , who employed Williamson as a secretary , remembers her as " a sweet , warmhearted girl . She was incapable of figuring out what she should do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two years later , Williamson headed for San Francisco , where , musician and boyfriend John Timothy recalls , she was avidly interested in Zen , meditation and the Ouija board . " She had a theatrical intensity , " says Timothy . " If she did n't like something , she hated it . If she felt betrayed , it was something out of Ibsen . " In 1979 , Williamson returned to Houston , where she ran a metaphysical bookstore . She was married briefly to a businessman , whom she refuses to discuss , and sang Gershwin standards at Rockefellers , a Houston nightclub . By 1983 , jobless and with just $1,000 in her pocket , Williamson moved to Los Angeles , where her interests in the spirit and the stage finally coalesced . There , Williamson began speaking to groups at the nonprofit Philosophical Research Society , drawing much of her material from A Course in Miracles , an arcane religious tract that stresses love and forgiveness as the basis of spiritual life . In time , her lectures evolved into a trendy amalgam of Christianity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her knack , in the words of record producer Jeff Olmsted , a former boyfriend , is in making " spiritual matters relevant to her own generation  --  something that young , liberal urban professionals can relate to . " Within a few years , her lectures on such topics as " Romantic Delusions " and " The Fear of Abandonment " began to draw Hollywood . " You do n't have to give up your whole existence in order to lead a spiritual life , " says actress Theresa Russell , commenting on Williamson 's appeal . " You can be " semi-enlightened . " That 's sort of the message she 's talking about . " Sometimes Marianne 's approach is gentle and nurturing . At the Manhattan Center for Living on a recent evening , approximately 100 people , mostly gay men , sat quietly in folding chairs as Williamson intoned . " I want you to close your eyes , " she said softly . " We see a golden temple , and inside that temple is an inner light . We are in that light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can also be refreshingly practical . At that same meeting , a young Frenchman stood to say that he was being forced to leave the country because of an expired visa and feared that he would be unable to re-enter the U.S. to tend his HIV-positive lover . " What you need is a good immigration lawyer , " said Williamson . " Pray to God to send you one right away . " Williamson , who has wryly referred to herself as " the bitch for God , " acknowledges that her interpersonal skills could stand some improvement . " Nobody at my lectures ever hears me say , " I 'm perfect , " " she says . " Am I dramatic at times ? Yes . But are my instincts usually right ? Yes . If I was a man , I 'd be considered a good leader . " As for the specific charges against her , she insists that staff resistance was what damaged the Divine Design auction . " If I was able to have the level of control that was appropriate , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Williamson also maintains that her management moves are based on sound business practice rather than whim . " People do n't get fired because of Marianne 's capricious ways or hormones , " she says . " It 's absolutely inaccurate to say that if Marianne does n't like someone , they 're out of here . " It may simply be that in the case of Marianne Williamson , as with other cult figures before her , private life does not  --  and can not  --  match public expectation . " I think some people who have written about her are sort of disappointed , " says actor Tony Perkins , an avid follower . " They want her to be a goddess of some kind . " Whether Williamson wants deification for herself is something that only she can tell . In the meantime , ruminating on the controversies swirling around her , she draws on the wisdom of her teachings . " These are growing pains . Every conflict will be healed , " she says with quiet equanimity . " I look forward to a happy outcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
