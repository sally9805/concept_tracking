Critics once called for his head . Now Citi 's boss is fully vindicated and pushing hard to create " a global growth company . " The only problem : His profit Headnote targets may be too rich for Wall Street ears . Photograph His look may be sober , but never in Reed 's 12 years as CEO have Citi 's results been cheerier . // THERE IS A DRAMA in two acts that plays out time and again in the affairs of corporations . First , poor management drives a company into deep trouble and its stock into ruin . Next , new management swoops in and , with purpose and resolve , begins the long haul of bringing the company back . At that turnaround moment , unsensed though it is by most investors , there arises a terrific stock market opportunity . So it has been at Citicorp , with one perverse twist . It was CEO John Shepard Reed who dug the company into trouble in the late 1980s and early 1990s , and it is the same Reed , now 57 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the disastrous days of 1991 , when Citi lost $457 million , wallowed in bad real estate loans , and fought off suspicions that it might actually fail , the company has climbed to a 1995 profit of $3.5 billion and a return on equity of nearly 18% . The dollars earned were the best ever not just for Citi , but for any U.S. bank . As for the stock , you could have bought it at $8.50 a share in December 1991 , and in early April this year you could have sold it for $81 . You might even have sold it to Citicorp itself : Since last summer , Citi has been plowing big money-$1.5 billion through December-into repurchases of its stock , paying an average price through year-end of $66 a share and continuing at the higher prices that have prevailed since . To some critics who remember how frantically short this company was of equity capital only a short while ago , those buybacks smell of the arrogance for which Citi has long been known . Fact is , though , that Citi has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Reed 's ambition reaches further still . In speeches to groups of analysts-he 's too reclusive to do one-onones-he 's persistently talking about a new vision , one entailing plans for high-powered growth . Citi 's goal , he says , is to increase earnings by 10% to 12% a year . Evidence suggests that Reed is probably pushing for even higher numbers , trying to turn Citi into what he calls " a global growth company . " Success in that quest would require a strong brand . So Reed has pulled in new management from outside the company to burnish the bank 's worldwide image . In this effort , Reed can harvest some Citicorp strengths he preserved when all was tumbling about him . Citi , for one thing , has arrived at this point with all its essential parts intact . During the tough years , it continued to invest in promising emerging markets , and it is now operating in 98 countries with two more coming up . Something else did n't happen : Citi was threatened during the crisis with having to sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that danger was ducked . So the business was around in 1995 to supply $1.2 billion in profits , about one-third of Citi 's total . Reed can meanwhile claim vindication-and the power that goes with it-for having produced a comeback that decks all the critics who clamored for his head in 1991 . Naturally he did n't care to lose it , nor did he think his exiting would serve Citi itself . Asked then by FORTUNE why he deserved to remain CEO , Reed said , " Well , you know , my sense of it is , I know what has to be done . I think I understand the problem . I think I have the right sort of response to it , and it is likely that I will get it done . Maybe more likely than anybody else . I would submit to you humbly-because I would n't want to say that I have n't been sort of forced to ask this-I 've asked myself if I 'm the right guy to do this , and I hate to tell you , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved it was . That intricate comment is also pure Reed : Deeply embarrassed by the events of that time , he nonetheless remained indestructibly confident that he was the fellow who could turn the ship . Photograph A rare photo op : Reed at a Goldman Sachs symposium // Today he 's the fellow who 's got eight years to Citi 's retirement age , the Bermuda Triangle behind him , and those visions of growth on his mind . That 's growth , not sheer size , a switch in emphasis that just happens to be convenient : Citi , though this year 's FORTUNE 500 shows it once again the biggest U.S. banking company by most financial measures , is about to lose the lead in assets to the new combination of Chemical and Chase . Once , this kind of demotion would have shaken Citi 's halls . But the crisis years changed many a Citi attitude , pride of size among them . To a security analyst who presumed to ask at a January meeting how Reed felt about dropping to No. 2 in assets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irrelevant and the question stupid . " We do n't think , " he said acidly , " that we 're the No. 2 bank . " It is an oddity that the chairman of a bank so recently mired in deep trouble can say that and get away with it . But it is a fact-vital to Reed in his growth ambitions-that Citi 's crisis years do not seem to have done lasting damage to its image or name . In its New York retail advertising , Citi has actually been making hay with its name , pointing out the constancy of " Citibank " while all around competitors are reconstituting and relabeling themselves . So the name is one horse that Reed drives today . It is that same " Citibank " that he proposes to turn into a worldwide consumer brand , establishing it in effect as the CocaCola or McDonald 's of financial services . What goes with the brand equity that those companies have , and he covets , is the ability to set themselves above the competition , either in the prices they can obtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brand-name companies is high price/earnings multiples , and in that respect Citi certainly comes across shy of brand equity . Coke 's P/E is 35 . Citi 's is 11 . YOKED TO REED 'S WISH for the brand is that announced goal of increasing Citi 's profits by 10% to 12% a year and of also maintaining at least an 18% return on equity . He flunked the profits goal in 1995-growth was only 3%-but the reason was a much bigger tax charge in 1995 than in 1994 . Pretax profits grew by a rousing 21% , helped especially by a bounceback in foreign exchange and other trading profits , and by near breakeven results in that graying albatross , North American commercial real estate . But investors wo n't put much of a multiple on trading profits , which are notoriously erratic . What Reed really needed in 1995 was strong growth from his bulwark consumer business , and all he got was 11% . Even so , you might say , that fits into the goal of 10% to 12% . But there is a funny thing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very least , Reed is aiming straight-out for 12%-you can tell that by certain inconsistencies between his overall target and those for individual businesses-and the better bet is that he 's set his sights still higher . " It 's 15% he 's going for . There 's no doubt about it , " says one man with a deep knowledge of Reed 's thinking . A 15% goal would be a traffic stopper . Fighting the fact that banking does n't even begin to grow that fast naturally , Reed 's predecessor , Walter Wriston , set precisely that target for Citi in the early 1970s , and eventually got it to be the biggest bank in the biggest mess , LDC ( less-developed countries ) loans . Because of this history , some investors would today view a Reed run for 15% as alarming . That is probably why Reed sticks to talking about 10% to 12% , no matter what his private intentions . He virtually confirmed that conjecture by something he said at a recent Merrill Lynch consumer products presentation for institutional investors , at which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a consumer products company disguised as a bank . Reed was asked there why he said he was shooting for a mere 18% return on equity , when his huge consumer businesses return 20% to 30% . Answering , Reed granted the inconsistency and said that about 85% of his businesseverything but corporate banking in the developed countries-could legitimately shoot for 30% returns . But " psychology , " he explained , was in the picture . " In our business , " he said , " it 's dangerous to embrace very aggressive return targets because the market interprets that as an appetite for risk . " Investors , he averred , would react to the targets adversely , saying , " These guys are nuts . They 're going to get into the derivatives business ; they 're going back into real estate and leveraged buyouts , and whatever the no-nos are . " So , said Reed , " we do n't want to communicate to the market an appetite for risk we do n't have , " and that 's why he talks 18% . From that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 12% for earnings growth are a smoke screen and that 15% may well be the true goal . FORTUNE could n't ask Reed about this directly , because he is n't talking to the press . He used to do so frequently and , despite his natural tendency to be remote , emerged in an interview as a journalist 's delight : impressively smart , thoughtful , honest to the bone , and also irrepressibly candid . But Reed decided in 1992 that he would let Citi 's results speak for themselves-which they were not yet loudly doing at that juncture-and he has since turned down virtually every interview request , including FORTUNE 's for this article . In Reed 's mind , also , reports a Citi spokesman , is the conviction that he does n't want to waste his time doing interviews when he 's got so many things on his plate . That presumably would include building the brand and meeting those earnings targets ( whatever they truly are ) and perhaps something more personal : a relatively new marriage . Having been divorced from his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then 37 , in September 1994 . She was a flight attendant on Citi 's corporate planes , and rumors about their romance were around as early as 1991 . The Reeds now live in a New York commuting town , Princeton , New Jersey , and also , improbably , in a Greenwich Village loft . John Reed has told old friends that he is exceedingly happy and caught up in new interests , like cooking . So this is a man who in the past few years has been rejuvenated both professionally and personally . HE HAS MEANWHILE been trying to whip up precisely the right mix of executives below him . Just this winter , Reed reshuffled his management team , ending up with a cadre of broadly experienced but still youngish executives in " one down " positions-meaning in Cititalk that they report directly to Reed . Down the road , a successor to Reed could conceivably come from this group . // After cratering , Citicorp 's total retun to investers has eclipsed a big-bank index and another constructed by Citi 's board to track the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell Philip Morris cigarettes , but he 's now stoking Citi 's branches and brand . // Among its members is a new chief financial officer , Victor Menezes , 46 , one of the several non-Americans-he 's from India-who populate the one-down layer . Menezes stepped into the hot spot vacated by executive vice president Christopher J. Steffen , 54 , a former Honeywell and Eastman Kodak executive whom Reed brought into Citi in 1993 to cut costs and who was abruptly ejected last December . Steffen 's work just did n't satisfy the boss . Diane Glossman , a Salomon Brothers bank analyst , remembers a moment early in 1995 when Reed told analysts that Citi was n't getting the productivity gains he wanted . " And when Reed said that , " recalls Glossman , " he looked right at Steffen . " More recently , another set of looks went in the direction of vice chairman Pei-yuan Chia , 57 , who , to the shock of many people aware of his longtime value to Citi , was announced to be leaving the bank and his job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't been going global as fast as Reed would like , and , besides , he is clearly suiting up the next generation of leaders . So two younger execs are taking over the core of Chia 's operations . One is Roberta J. Arena , 48 , an American who runs credit cards in North America and Europe and who is widely admired for her managerial skills . Can you imagine the next CEO of Citi , with its macho image , being a woman ? It could perhaps happen . If it does , the world will get to hear Arena 's arresting and near-Germanic way of finishing off comments , as in , " Just a slight improvement in our penetration would have a pretty good payoff-okay ? " The other successor to Chia , and certainly a one-downer of note , is William I. Campbell , 51 , whom Reed imported to be the worldwide boss of the branch business , called Citibanking . A marketing man , Campbell spent 28 years at Philip Morris and was head of its U.S. tobacco operations on 1993 's famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then " retired " - at age 50-last summer . Before leaving , he had the distinction of being one of the seven tobacco executives who turned up before a congressional committee in early 1994 , raised their hands in unison to swear they 'd tell the truth , and testified to the nonaddictiveness of nicotine . The Department of Justice currently has an investigation under way to see whether any of the seven committed perjury . Reed got to know Campbell through the Philip Morris board , where Reed has had a seat for the past 20 years . Campbell joined Citi last year as a marketing consultant , but Reed has now made him an executive vice president in charge of building the worldwide brand . Following Reed 's cue , Campbell is n't talking to the press either . But some clue as to where he is headed can be gleaned from a speech he gave in February to graduating business school students at the University of Richmond . He never mentioned Citi , but he told them to " go global or go gray , " which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " go gray " may have referred to his own mop of hair . But it also fits Citi 's ambition-hardly unique among financial service companies-to haul in the assets of maturing baby-boomers . For example , Citi would like to sell these folk scads of mutual funds . But it has lagged in this business and seems to lack a strategy to cure that . Reed has said that Citi has considered buying a mutual fund company but that the investment decision has n't looked good when stacked up against repurchases of Citi 's stock-a finding that ought to gratify investors tired of seeing CEOs indiscriminately tear after acquisitions . GOING GLOBAL is what Citi has done for 100 years and simply wants now to do more intensely . A global brand requires a consistent image . So Citi has rapidly been building model branches-modern and user-friendly-around the world , with these numbering 439 out of a total of 1,203 branches . In every country , that consumer piece of plastic-the Citicardlooks the same , carrying two big blue arrows . It was not always so . Once , Citi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hues . But in the mid-1980s , Pei Chia decreed uniformity , reminding his troops that a parent gives two things to a child : its color and name . So , said Chia , " our name is Citibank , and our color is blue . " None of these things means that the Citi name resonates the same in all geographies . In the U.S. , where Citi has branches in eight states , it is no more classy than most banks . In many countries outside the U.S. , however , Citi has a decidedly upscale image . It is viewed both as a bigtime , sophisticated place to work and as a harbor for serious money . In the Asia-Pacific area , for example , Citi does not solicit small accounts . What Citi sells hard in that part of the world is the Citigold account , which generally requires the customer to have assets lodged with the bank - either investments or cash-of $100,000 or more . In return , the customer gets special services , such as a daily sweep of his cash deposits into money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantity of assets-and also paying a $125 annual fee-can get a Citigold account too , but the concept is not aggressively marketed in the U.S. Photograph CEO material ? Arena 's managerial skills have made her shine in a largely male arena . // Some of the company 's cachet abroad has translated into impressive profits , particularly in the emerging areas of the Asia-Pacific region , where Citi 's commercial and consumer franchises last year made $781 million . That was more than one-fifth of the company 's total profits and a leap of 34% from 1994 . That 's in spite of tough competition , especially on the corporate side of the bank . In certain Asian locations-Hong Kong and Singapore , for example-Citi 's commercial bankers are up against international players like Chase and J.P . Morgan . In all spots , they 're battling local banks . One " local " name is particularly formidable : Hongkong &; Shanghai Bank , a subsidiary of HSBC Holdings , which is very international . HSBC ( whose big U.S. property is Marine Midland ) operates in 71 countries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's 98 . In credit cards , Citi also faces American Express , which Reed thinks of as the " only other global brand " in financial services . But Amex has no great strength internationally Its Asian profits , for example , are less than one-fifth of Citi 's . One institutional investor noted the contrast between the two companies when he went to Asia to study Citi . He was impressed , but what jumped out at him , he says , was the weakness displayed by American Express . You can not leap from a specific competitive superiority to a conclusion that Citi can build a successful worldwide brand ; too many important roadblocks stand in the way . But when FORTUNE recently asked three different marketing experts-none with any connection to Citi-what they thought of the company 's brand prospects , each had something positive to say . David Aaker , a professor at the University of California at Berkeley , has only the barest mention of Citi in his new book , Building Strong Brands , and he does not slight the difficulties of a financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Citi as way ahead of its competitors , saying , " I do n't think other people are going to be able to copy them . " Kenneth Roberts , head of Lippincott &; Margulies , a corporate-identity consulting firm in New York City , believes Citi 's longstanding focus on the consumer-two decades old now-gives it a real leg up in knowing how to burnish a brand worldwide . Also , he says , this brand and this bank , Citibanking and Citi , are synonymous , and therefore relatively simple to market . Consultants at the Optima Group , in Fairfield , Connecticut , feel that the ultimate ability of any financial services company to establish a brand will depend on its technical ability to sort and manage data about its customer base , and to market the right products to the right customers . And here , says Kenneth Hoffman , head of Optima , Citi has a lead : " We talk to some of Citi 's competitors , and they feel that Citi is ahead on this curve . " Evidence of that is not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrilled by the fact that they can walk into a Citibank thousands of miles from home base and , working on an ATM , do all they can at home  --  check their balances , transfer money from one of their accounts to another , pay their Citi credit card bill . For a bank , however , this kind of interaction with a customer is not the same as behind-thescenes sorting of data for marketing purposes . But in the U.S. , and particularly in the Citi skyscraper that towers over the flats of Queens , in New York City , the company is unceasingly at work on an ambitious $700 million database project called the Relationship Banking System ( RBS ) . " Relationship " means two things here : first , the warm , friendly vibes that the system is supposed to generate between Citi and its customer , and second , the body of data that Citi expects to assemble about a customer and all his relations-yes , kinfolk . On the vibes front , RBS will allow all of Citi 's consumer customers , by use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the moving parts of their financial lives . For example , at day-end , they can check how their mutual funds did that day or how much interest they earned . Most of us may have got along quite nicely without that level of detail about interest-but , hey , who knows ? Citi 's purpose , in any event , is to make banking something of an " experience " that will bind customers to the bank . // Blue sky it is , but growth rates that Reed projects for various parts of Citi have been packaged by FORUNE to show his profit hopes for cord operations five years out . The scenario has total profits rising at a 12% annual rate , from $3.6 billion to $6.3 billion , and the branches growing at a wicked 20%. // On the kin front , Citi will be installing around 7,000 new computer workstations that its people will use to build up a huge database about customers as they open new accounts or refinance a mortgage or whatever . So a Citi branch employee will be asking , say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . That data will go into what 's called " household information , " or HHI . Then , as it comes time for young John to enter college , the system will spit out a mailing to his parents , suggesting that Citi is ready to help with a loan . And John himself will be offered a low-interest credit card . And so it will go forever , in this land of sort and market . Citi had planned to have RBS up and running by now . But the company has reportedly run into fierce problems getting the technology to work , and D-day is delayed . It will come , though , because this system seems central to Reed 's brand-building goals . " This market as we understand it , " he said in his Merrill Lynch speech , " is an experience on the part of the customer and a promise on the part of the supplier . " Weld them together , he said , and they build " relationships lasting across life cycles . " In the end , Citi 's ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to depend on two unpredictable matters . One is the basic question about brand equity : Will consumers in effect " oversubscribe " to Citi 's offerings , either by providing it with plump market shares or paying premium prices for some service they might well get more cheaply down the street ? It 's worth remembering that brand recognition , which Citi certainly has , is not brand equity . No bank , in fact , has yet proved it can step up and grab that gold ring . Moreover , today 's never-ending advances in electronic communications are a distinct hazard for brands , particularly those financial . Reed himself got a close-up reminder of that point recently when he and Robert M. Howe , an IBM financial services expert , ended up as speakers on the same panel at a Goldman Sachs conference attended by many bankers . Said Howe in his speech , with Reed two feet away : " In a virtual banking world , what is the value of your brand when I can page through my PC and see every financial institution that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was the value of Citi 's brand a few years ago , when it tried to keep fees on its credit cards even as competitors all around it were dropping theirs ? Not much : The company lost tons of market share and was eventually forced into what Reed calls its own Marlboro Friday , in which it started to phase out its fees , meanwhile accepting an annual loss of fee revenues of $300 million . That slide , of course , was the result of competitors attacking a market of rich returns , and Citi can expect similar invaders in other profitable parts of its world . Says Reed : " The competition is unformed at this point . It will form . " The other question , as has ever been the case , is whether Citi can manage its big , sprawling bailiwick , including so many geographies that executives-or perhaps their speechwriters-ca n't keep them straight . At a recent Citicorp presentation for analysts , vice chairman Paul Collins spoke of Citi 's plan to move next into Israel and then into Lebanon and Gabon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . It 's Angola that Collins should have mentioned . But that 's a detail , and the brand-building exercise is fundamental . It will demand expert execution at all levels of management , including the one-down layer that has just been added to the cake . Reed has talked frequently about the need to get the right people in the right places , and there 's no way of telling whether he 's got an effective lineup in place at the moment . If he concludes he has n't , there will surely be fast changes again , for he has shown absolutely no tolerance for so-so performance . Three years ago , with Citi clearly on the mend but not yet fit , some students of its workings worried that Reed would revert-slip back to the old Citi beliefs that it could do whatever it cared to , in any quarter of the world , at whatever pace was required . If he 's pushing for 15% earnings gains , some covert form of reversion may already be rumbling around . On the other hand , Reed has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems with unusual focus and consistency . The drill , he told analysts in January , is to keep on that track , to put " one step in front of another , year after year . " A swashbuckling style that 's not . But a reasonable rule for building a brand it could just possibly be . <p>
