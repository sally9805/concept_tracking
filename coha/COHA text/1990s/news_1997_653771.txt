<p> DO N'T try singing the praises of progress to Joseph Wiendl , a 26-year-old Navy lieutenant based in Jacksonville , Fla. , who wants to go to business school . Lieutenant Wiendl originally planned to take the Graduate Management Admission Test next year , but will instead submit to the ordeal on Saturday , the last time it is being offered on paper . <p> " There was no way I was going to take something as important as the G.M.A.T. on a computer , " he said . " You ca n't take notes in the margins of the screen or underline any of the reading passages . The computer test gives an advantage to people who can type well . I 'm not a professional typist , so how could I possibly make up for that ? " <p> Lieutenant Wiendl is not an isolated technophobe . Administrators of the G.M.A.T. say the number of people who signed up for the exam to be given this week swelled 25.5 percent , to 83,000 , from the enrollment last June , and they attribute the increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer . The total does not include the 3,000 or so walk-ins who are expected to show up at the last minute at various test sites nationwide . <p> Similar angst is spreading through the test-taking world as more and more academic and professional exams abandon No. 2 pencils for the cathode-ray tube . The Graduate Record Exam , that trial by fire for college students aspiring to go to graduate school , will be fully computerized in two years . Law school and medical school admissions tests are not yet scheduled to change . But nurses , architects , pharmacists , podiatrists and stockbrokers already take their licensing exams on the computer , with accountants , engineers and land surveyors possibly making the change soon . <p> If that is not enough evidence that computerized testing is the wave of the future , consider that the Scholastic Assessment Test  --  a rite of passage for college-bound high school students for five decades and until this year known as the Scholastic Aptitude Test  --  is expected to be available on computer in most urban areas by 2003 . That conversion should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folklore , alongside washboards and record players . <p> So why are so many test-takers so nervous ? After all , this is the information age , and most Americans are reasonably adept at punching the keys of computer keyboards . Moreover , when some of the test-givers announced plans just four years ago to phase out paper testing , they trumpeted the change as a great leap forward . No longer would students be herded into crowded auditoriums to scribble and erase little circles of graphite into their test booklets . Instead , small groups in idyllically spacious quarters would serenely tap out their answers on computer keyboards . The test-givers also heralded the arrival of smarter tests that could better gauge in fewer questions a fitting score . <p> In 1997 , that dream is only marginally closer . Worried about allowing a computer to have a hand in their fate , many people are rushing to sign up for the last paper tests before the changeover . Students who want to take the paper version of the G.R.E . have until spring of 1999 , while some professionals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their licensing exams on paper . <p> THE reason for the nervousness , it turns out , is not just unfamiliarity with computers ; it is dismay at the design of the computerized exams , called computer adaptive tests , or C.A.T . ' s . <p> Only one question appears on the screen at a time , and test-takers must answer it before moving on . This means that you ca n't skip around or go back to change an answer , as you can under the manual method . Moreover , a C.A.T . selects questions based on real-time performance . Answer a question correctly and the computer serves up a harder one . Answer it incorrectly and  --  presto !  --  you get an easier question until you finally show your mettle . The C.A.T . score is based on the level at which you got about half the answers right . The number of correct answers is not nearly as important as the level at which you start getting wrong answers . <p> It is a system that can not help but fluster test-takers . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and unpleasant surprises can occur . Edie Sagenkahn , a 30-year-old nurse at Johns Hopkins University Hospital in Baltimore , recalled her panic at being cut off less than a third of the way through 265 questions on a licensing exam last year . <p> " I was just cruising along , and then the computer just shut off after I had answered the 75th one , " she said . " I did n't know if I had passed or failed . I just sat there saying , ' Oh , my God ! What does this mean ? ' " Later , she found out a friend had plowed through 210 questions , and she felt even worse . Two weeks later , she learned she had passed ; the computer often shuts off early if the test-taker is performing very well . <p> For many students , though , a date with C.A.T . can turn into an unpredictable few hours . Unable to skip around , they must guess or be penalized for not getting through enough of the test . Scratch paper is limited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who use computers at work sometimes say they have trouble reading essays on the screen during licensing exams . <p> Making matters worse , some applicants say , test administrators who are worried about cheating sometimes treat test-takers like potential criminals . Ms. Sagenkahn described the proctor sent by Sylvan Learning Systems , a for-profit company that is the world 's leading administrator of computer tests , as downright mean , snappily telling the test-takers to dump all their belongings into lockers . While this is standard security procedure at Sylvan , the proctor also confiscated Ms. Sagenkahn 's car keys , a measure not included in the company 's policy . <p> " You 'd think that they would go out of their way to make you feel comfortable , but that was n't the case at my center , " Ms. Sagenkahn said . " Maybe the proctor got up on the wrong side of the bed . But when she asked for my car keys , I started to ask if she wanted my shoelaces , too . " <p> Christopher Hoehn-Saric , Sylvan Learning 's chairman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his company 's biggest headaches has always been impostors taking tests for other people , he said . <p> " Taking the C.A.T . is a little like an I.R.S. audit , " Mr. Hoehn-Saric said with a laugh . " It can only be so pleasant . But these are important exams , and we have to make sure everyone is honest or the scores wo n't mean anything . The security makes C.A.T . fair to everybody . " <p> The agony does n't end when the exam is over . With the old pencil-and-paper format , test-takers often wait several months for scores , but at least they have had the luxury of canceling  --  erasing their participation in the test  --  within two weeks of taking it if they think they 've botched the job . Because the C.A.T . calculates the score almost as soon as the test is over , students who wish to cancel have to do the dirty deed immediately or the score stands forever . Testing experts worry that this requirement will prompt some nervous Nellies to cancel what could be stellar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no good reason . <p> Perhaps the biggest controversy about computerized testing is the question of its fairness . Critics say it puts a computer novice at a severe disadvantage . They also say it differs so starkly from written tests in its methodology that students with a choice  --  including those taking the G.M.A.T. this Saturday and those taking the G.R.E . within the next two years  --  risk lowering their scores if they choose the wrong type . <p> To be sure , those fears may be exaggerated . Three surveys over the past seven years  --  by the Graduate Management Admission Council , which oversees the G.M.A.T. ; the College Board , which oversees the SAT , and the National Council of the State Boards of Nursing  --  suggest that computerized tests elicit performances comparable to their paper predecessors . The most comprehensive survey , conducted last October as 3,000 people agreed to take the management admission test on both computer and paper on condition that they could report the higher score , found that the average scores were almost identical . <p> But no survey has addressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . into the testing mainstream : the cost . The two million high school students who take the SAT each year may be charged a lofty admission fee that critics say could discriminate against the poor . <p> The College Board tested a computerized version of the SAT at Johns Hopkins University but was disappointed last summer when only 2,700 junior high school students  --  less than 10 percent of those eligible to take the test  --  signed up for it . Test officials themselves blamed the $75 entrance cost , almost four times that of the paper test . <p> " WE know that the cost of the test is one thing that may stand in our way of putting the SAT on computer , " said Michael Shaffer , an executive director of the College Board . " We know there is no way to test two million kids at $75 a pop . We 'll have to work the price down . " <p> The price gap results mostly from the costs of writing new test questions and should narrow over time , test experts say . Organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of need . But they are more likely to follow the lead of the Educational Testing Service , the nonprofit organization that administers the Graduate Record Exam and other tests . Going forward , computer and paper-and-pencil versions of the G.R.E . will cost the same : $96 . <p> Despite all the resistance , the computer tests are here to stay , and no one wants to cede any turf . Already , squabbles have broken out among the organizations out to establish a stake in the booming computer-test market . Back in January 1995 , E.T.S. sued Stanley H. Kaplan Educational Center Ltd. , the nation 's leading test-preparation company , accusing it of copyright infringement . E.T.S. contended that Kaplan 's employees had swiped questions off the tests . <p> Kaplan denies any wrongdoing . " The only reason they sued us is because we questioned the security of the computer test , " said Andrew S. Rosen , executive vice president at Kaplan . " E.T.S. is accountable to no one . What they are saying with the lawsuit is , ' You question us and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the companies have sounded a lot like two cats hissing . E.T.S. , which for years balked at selling test preparation classes , has come out with Powerprep , a $50 computer program for the Graduate Record Exam . Ads for Powerprep take a few swipes at Kaplan , a unit of the Washington Post Company . On one , a male college student is leaning against a tree beneath the caption : " Powerprep seems to be a breakthrough for those of us who desire to prepare at home and not pay $1,000 for some class that probably wo n't help . " <p> The brawl went industrywide in November when the American College Testing program , which produces the other college admissions test used in American schools , sued Sylvan Learning Systems , which has the contract to administer all of E.T.S. 's computer tests , on accusations that it was trying to monopolize the market . The lawsuit , which is pending in United States District Court in Iowa City , Iowa , contends that Sylvan 's close ties to E.T.S. give it an unfair advantage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock in Sylvan , and the E.T.S. president , Nancy Cole , sits on Sylvan 's board . <p> Mr. Hoehn-Saric , Sylvan Learning 's chairman , denies any wrongdoing , saying that " just because A.C.T . ca n't compete in the market does n't mean there is a monopoly . " <p> For all the confusion surrounding the spread of computerized testing , even thedetractors are quick to acknowledge its advantages . Developed by the military , several research universities and E.T.S. in the late 1970 's , a C.A.T . was first used professionally by the National Council of the State Boards of Nursing in 1991 to shorten the licensing exam for nurses from two days to five hours . For decades , nurses had to complete a battery of sections , but with computerized tests they can pass or fail by answering as few as 75 questions ( as Ms. Sagenkahn discovered ) . <p> The speedier format is a result of the computerized scoring system . Since nurses , and other professionals who take licensing exams , are essentially on a pass-fail system , the computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the required score . Conversely , students who are scoring so poorly from the beginning that they have no chance of passing are also dismissed quickly , with the hopes that they will return home to brush up on the subject . <p> THE instantaneous scoring has also revolutionized employee recruiting in some industries . <p> " Since nursing students can get their scores a few days after they take the licensing exams , hospitals now expect them to have their licenses or at least have sat for their tests when they show up for job interviews , " said Susan Appling , an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins School of Nursing . " Years ago , students who were waiting to get their test results back were often hired by hospitals as graduate nurses . Now , hospitals have virtually eliminated that job category . " <p> Graduate schools also like the quicker results . Traditionally , the management admission test and the Graduate Record Exam were offered only a few times a year , creating a flood of applications to admissions officers just days before deadlines . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , year-round . Moreover , a C.A.T . not only disperses the flow of scores , it downloads them directly into the universities ' computers . Experts estimate that the process could save universities millions of dollars in administrative costs when computerized testing is more widespread . And there is at least the fetching possibility that computerized testing will allow graduate schools to customize their tests . <p> One recent taker of the computerized Graduate Record Exam , Elizabeth Fettweis of Randolph , N.J. , had no complaints . " Every time I took a pencil and paper test , I spent hours all hunched over reading and erasing , " she said . " The C.A.T . is so much better . You can look up and see the question on the screen . " <p> Yet , as luminous as C.A.T . ' s advantages are , skepticism about its methodology has n't gone away . Even people who have mastered the art of taking a computerized test have reservations . <p> Rebecca Querry , a nursing graduate of Johns Hopkins , still finds it outrageous that she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answering only one question on childbirth . What if her answer had only been a lucky guess ? The written nursing exam once had an entire section dedicated to that subject . <p> " If the computer gives me a question , and I get it right , it assumes that I know the topic , " said Ms. Querry , who passed the test with a minimum 75 questions . " In actuality , I may have only known those questions . I could have faked a whole section with the computer test . I could have never done that on the paper version . " <p> Charts : " Passing of the Pencil " Over the last four years , a number of academic and professional exams have been converted from traditional pencil and paper to computer terminals .
