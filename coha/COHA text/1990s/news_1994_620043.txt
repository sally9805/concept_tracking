<p> In an 11th-hour attempt to salvage a bipartisan health care reform plan , a rump group of Republican and Democratic senators yesterday dusted off a previously discarded approach once promoted as " Clinton Lite . " <p> President Clinton , while remaining noncommittal on the plan , urged Congress not to give up on health reform . <p> " Keep working . Keep working at it . Because if you delay you may well lose it all together , " he said at a White House press conference . <p> Clinton voiced some skepticism about whether the plan crafted by the self-described " mainstream coalition " would work , but he said he is keeping an open mind . " I think we need to let this thing unfold a little more , " he said . " I would n't prejudge it . " <p> FOCUS ON DEFICIT CUTTING <p> The coalition plan falls far short of the universal coverage that Clinton said he would insist on and instead focuses on reducing medical costs and trimming the federal deficit . Backers say it would reduce the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California Democrat Dianne Feinstein is among the group of 16 moderates from both parties who forged an alternative to the administration-backed plan by majority leader George Mitchell , which is sinking fast as it becomes increasingly clear that it can not pass . <p> " If this does n't break the logjam , nothing will , " said Connecticut Democrat Joseph Lieberman . <p> ' REALITY CHECK ' <p> " This is a reality check for this Congress , " added John Breaux , the Louisiana Democrat who , with Rhode Island Republican John Chafee , heads the group . He called it " reform in the marketplace , not an increase in the bureaucracy . " <p> Breaux and Tennessee Representative Jim Cooper were co-authors of a highly touted but controversial bill known as the Managed Competition Act . Peddled by Cooper as " Clinton Lite " in the days when the president 's plan enjoyed widespread support , it lost support in May after it received skeptical marks from the Congressional Budget Office , the independent arm of Congress that analyzes the fiscal impact of bills . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rodham Clinton , and its apparent defeat last spring was one of the few victories the administration has scored on its health care reform campaign . <p> But Dr. Paul Ellwood , president of the Jackson Hole Group , a Wyoming think tank that dreamed up the Cooper bill , confirmed yesterday that the coalition plan is little different from the earlier bill . <p> " We 've come full circle , " he said . " We introduced Cooper- Breaux a year ago , and here we are . " <p> Ellwood said the coalition bill " has all the elements of managed competition , " the marketplace theory developed by Stanford University Professor Alain Enthoven . <p> The reforms would steer consumers away from insurance plans that provide unlimited choice of doctors , and steer them into HMOs such as Kaiser Permanente , which closely manage the cost of care . It remains unclear whether Clinton would veto the measure , as he once promised to do to any plan that fell short of guaranteeing health insurance to all Americans " that can never be taken away . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clinton 's original proposal , it may offer the president his only chance of saving his premier policy initiative . <p> It shifts the focus to deficit reduction , which in the past few days has come to overshadow promises of broader and better health insurance coverage . Like the Mitchell bill , it includes reforms to bar insurers from dropping coverage of the sick , and uses subsidies  --  vastly scaled back  --  to make insurance more affordable to the poor . <p> The plan also takes the controversial step of taxing health insurance plans that exceed the cost of average plans in a given region . Such taxes are opposed by labor unions and conservative Republicans . <p> Whether Mitchell and minority leader Robert Dole will accept the alternative also remains far from clear . The leadership must push the plan if it is to come to the floor for a vote before Labor Day . <p> Mitchell seemed favorably disposed , commending the effort and saying he would study it over the weekend and discuss it with other members . <p> MITCHELL OPTIMISTIC <p> " My hope is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the efforts of these senators , " Mitchell said . <p> Dole was less optimistic , suggesting that Congress should " go home for a few weeks and take this back up in September . " <p> Congress should not rush through a hastily cobbled plan , Dole insisted after meeting with the group . <p> " It may be getting late in the process no matter what kind of package you have , " he said . " The American people have bought into the idea that we should n't do health care reform this year because they do n't understand it . " <p> And Bob Packwood of Oregon , leading the Republican charge on health care , said that there already have been " four or five attempts " at a bipartisan plan that would " save everything , " but that none have come to fruition . <p> But the coalition 's plan has elements that may appeal to many Republicans . Indeed , the group includes moderate Republicans Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas and Christopher Bond of Missouri , as well as conservative Democrat David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving a health bill , Feinstein said the group aimed at " certain basic elements , " that include " certainty " for those who have insurance now , reforms so that insurance can not be canceled when one falls ill or denied to those who have a pre-existing illness , and deficit reduction . <p> " The best way to achieve health care reform is to take it step by step , " she said . <p> Yesterday morning , liberal Democrats staged a rally on the Senate floor , waving their own government-paid health insurance cards and declaring that all Americans must have the same . <p> Paul Wellstone , D-Minn , a liberal advocate of a Canadian-style government-run health insurance system , delivered a blistering critique of the Mitchell bill and of the so-called mainstream proposal . <p> " I do n't see how the people we are supposed to be helping will be helped by this proposal , " he said . " I believe they represent a great leap backward . " <p> And conservative Republicans , led by Indiana Republican Dan Coats , derided the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE NEW ' MAINSTREAM ' HEALTH CARE PLAN <p> Key elements of the health care plan offered by a maverick group of Republican and Democratic senators led by John Breaux , D-La. , and John Chafee , R-R.I. : <p> GOAL : To cover 95 percent of Americans by 2001 through marketplace reforms that contain the costs of health insurance and through subsidies for the poor . If the goal is not reached , a commission would recommend ways for Congress to achieve it , but there is no mandate . It also sets a target of a $ 100 billion reduction in the federal deficit in 10 years . <p> FINANCING : A 45-cent increase in the tobacco tax ; higher Medicare premiums for the wealthy with a reduction in Medicare rates to doctors and hospitals ; a tax on health plans that cost more than the average plan in a region . <p> INSURANCE REFORMS : Insurance companies must sell policies to all who apply . A policy could not be canceled if someone becomes sick or changes jobs . Insurers could charge a higher rate to older customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work for small businesses . <p> STANDARD BENEFIT : The bill would establish two standards . One is based on the benefits offered in a typical Blue Cross plan offered to all federal employees . The other is a more bare-bones plan , with higher deductibles , that would cost less . <p> EMPLOYER RESPONSIBILITIES : All employers would have to offer , but not pay for , a choice of health insurance plans for their workers . If available , they must offer a health maintenance organization , a standard plan that pays bills of any doctor when submitted , and a so-called Point of Service plan , an HMO that permits members to see outside doctors for a higher fee . <p> HEALTH ALLIANCES : Like the original Clinton plan , it would set up health insurance purchasing cooperatives so small business employees and individuals could pick from a menu of health plans and have the same buying clout as big business . But the cooperatives in this bill would be private , and no one would be required to join . <p> SUBSIDIES : Premiums would be paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 14,335 annual income for a family of four . They would be available on a sliding scale for people living up to double the poverty level . Subsidies would be available to pregnant women and children up to 18 years of age with incomes up to 240 percent of poverty . <p> MEDICARE : The system would remain in place , but seniors and the disabled also could obtain private health insurance through their employer or a health alliance . <p> MEDICAID : Encourages states to enroll poor patients in private health maintenance organizations . California already is developing such a program . <p> LONG-TERM CARE : Establishes a new program to provide home care and community-based care for the aged living at up to 150 percent of the poverty level . It would be paid for by a new " auto insurance offset , " in effect a tax on auto policies .
