// IT 'S HARD TO IMAGINE FILM CRITICS GENE SISKEL and Roger Ebert being in agreement with legions of limp , lovesick Leonardo DiCaprio fans , but on their Feb. 14 telecast the duo found common ground with girls around the globe . In a segment discussing this year 's Academy Award nominees , Siskel emphatically declared " DiCaprio was robbed " of Oscar recognition , and Ebert chimed in , " What are they thinking ? ! " Although Hollywood did n't expect DiCaprio , 23 , to clinch a nomination ( he had been passed over for warm-up awards like the Golden Globes ) , his fans did , so his Oscar no-show came as a shocking , berg-like blow to DiCapriettes everywhere . " It completely flabbergasted me , " says Neera Shukla , 20 , a Toronto-based college student and president of a Leonardo fan club . " Titanic brought tears to my eyes , and he was a big part of that ! ! I 'm having difficulty believing he was just overlooked . " Given that five weeks into the movie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all U.S. teenage girls had seen the movie twice , it 's safe to say that the teen Titaniacs were , like , really bummed . " I was upset he was n't nominated . Extremely ! " says Kim Cortes , 16 , a student at New York 's School of American Ballet whose bedroom is plastered with Leo posters and who 's seen the ship go down four times . Adds her Titanic-crazed classmate Jessica Kusak , 16 : " They went for older men , like Peter Fonda . " Even Celine Dion opined on the fracas : " To me , he 's James Dean . He 's wonderful-I ca n't believe he 's not nominated ! " Some outraged Leo lovers railed against the abject cruelty of it all . More than 200 DiCaprio fans have E-mailed or phoned the Academy 's L.A. headquarters demanding a recount . " They 're asking if anything can be done to get Leonardo nominated before the awards show , " says a bemused Academy spokesman . " The calls did not just come from teenagers . One older woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But what if a nod for DiCaprio had been among Titanic 's record-tying nominations ? Would Hollywood be expressing its surprise ? Though he 's perceived as a fiercely talented actor and has been praised for his performances in movies like 1993 's This Boy 's Life , DiCaprio 's turn in Titanic is not considered to be his personal best . " I watched Siskel and Ebert , and I could n't believe they went on and on and on and on ... , " says one agent , who asks to remain anonymous . " I 'm sure Leo 's prouder of his performance in What 's Eating Gilbert Grape for which he received an Oscar nod in 1994 or Marvin 's Room than Titanic . When everything 's said and done , he was in a special-effectsladen movie . " But if the movie 's techno appeal was the obstacle , why were costars Kate Winslet and Gloria Stuart still singled out ? Explains Peter Rainer , chairman of the National Society of Film Critics : " The fact that Winslet and Stuart were nominated shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious choices for Best Actor . And there were even better performances than his , such as Al Pacino 's in Donnie Brasco , that were overlooked . " That comes as cold , icy comfort for his fans , but they can be proud that their devotion to Titanic-nearly $403 million worth to date domestically-means DiCaprio will never travel steerage again . Although he earned one of his heftiest paychecks ( $2.5 million , plus 5 percent of the net profit ) playing the romantic vagabond Jack Dawson , that 's a pittance compared with what he 'll get for his next project . Thanks to Titanic , DiCaprio 's asking price has zoomed to $20 million , making him the newest member of the exclusive club where the Astors and Gettys of Hollywood , including Mel Gibson , Tom Hanks , and Tom Cruise , now hang . And his dash into the VIP lounge may justify itself the weekend of March 13 , when his next movie , MGM 's The Man in the Iron Mask , based on the Alexandre Dumas novel , opens . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MGM Distribution marketing honcho Gerry Rich . " Without him , the movie would skew older . " If the fancy-pants costume drama ends up anywhere near the top of the box office , Leo will get the lion 's share of the credit . Then again , it 's possible DiCaprio may be about to break Hollywood 's heart . Primarily an indie-film actor , the baby-faced performer reportedly does n't want to be a mainstream movie star and currently has no plans to make another movie until early ' ' 99 . Except for a role in the upcoming Woody Allen film , he 's got nothing lined up , and he 's met with execs only to discuss one movie , Laws of Madness , an Imagine Entertainment project about a schizophrenic law student . No matter how long it takes for DiCaprio to find his next job , his fans claim their devotion will remain as deep as the Titanic 's watery grave . " He 's a great actor , he 's really beautiful , he 's passionate , " says L.A. 's 14-year-old Sasha Bass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't go see him in . " Words like that have left Hollywood with its own case of Leo-itis . <p>
