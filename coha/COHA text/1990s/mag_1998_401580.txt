The inside story of how an elite bomb squad dismantled the Unabomber 's last deadly device . Photograph // IT WAS THE CASE OF A LIFETIME , and it had taken nearly a generation to unfold . Federal authorities finally arrested Theodore J. Kaczynski , known as the Unabomber , in a one-room cabin deep in the Montana wilderness , after receiving a tip from his brother . For 17 years , Kaczynski , a math whiz and former college professor , had outwitted the law , waging a war against what he perceived to be the evils of technology . His battle had claimed three lives and injured 22 . Many of his bombings had victimized individuals associated with universities or airlines , hence the Un-a-bomber moniker given him by the FBI . With Kaczynski 's arrest , however , another battle of wits began , one that matched scientific genius gone astray against a three-man team of bomb disposal specialists armed with the latest in technological gadgetry . Although Kaczynski was arrested in April 1996 , the role of this special bomb squad was merely hinted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this past February . Only now , following the May sentencing of Kaczynski to life imprisonment , can their story be told . The war of wits began when FBI agents peered inside Kaczynski 's tiny cabin and discovered a live bomb , packaged and ready for mailing but unaddressed . Normally , this would n't be cause for too much excitement . A bomb disposal squad would remove the device and explode it harmlessly . This time was different . The FBI needed the bomb defused but also intact for forensic evidence . The Unabomber had built his devices so they could n't be linked to him , and FBI analysis of debris fragments had yielded few clues . The only common threads were the initials " FC , " for Freedom Club , inscribed on eight of the 16 bombs ultimately attributed to the Unabomber , letters from FC to newspapers , and a lengthy manifesto published by The Washington Post and The New York Times in September 1995 . To its credit , the FBI had already realized that defusing a bomb intact was beyond its capabilities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chris Cherry , a researcher at Sandia National Laboratories , a federal weapons research facility in Albuquerque , New Mexico . Cherry , a Department of Defense veteran of classified operations , is considered by those in the secretive bomb technician community to be the dean of bomb disposal experts . For the next nine months , Cherry would be on standby in case a Unabomber device was intercepted before it exploded . Cherry 's team would include veteran Sandia assistant Rod Owenby and Vic Poisson , a longtime friend and associate with the Riverside , California , police department . // Shortly after Kaczynski 's arrest , Cherry and Poisson were on the phone discussing the case when Cherry 's other line buzzed . It was 6:30 p.m. on Good Friday , and Cherry was looking forward to Easter with his wife . Cherry put Poisson on hold and picked up the other line . It was the FBI . " We have a device , " said the agent on the other end of line . " It 's under the bed in Kaczynski 's cabin . " Cherry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hang up . " The FBI immediately dispatched planes to bring Cherry 's team members and their gear to the scene . Owenby was excited on the plane . The airport pickup had been conducted like a clandestine operation . Only first names were used , and no questions were asked . " Is n't this neat ? " Owenby asked Cherry . " It will be if we 're successful , " replied Cherry , who was beginning to sense the pressure . At that point , Cherry thought he would be gone from home for two days at most . He had n't anticipated what lay ahead . By 7 a.m. the next morning , the three men had arrived at the site in Lincoln , Montana . The cabin was a few miles south of town , 500 yards up a narrow trail through a forest . It sat astride the Great Divide of the Rocky Mountains at 6,376 feet above sea level . The three passed through multiple checkpoints , each manned by federal agents toting machine guns . Finally , they saw the cabin in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked like a storage shed at one of our houses , " remembers Owenby . Since 1971 , it had been Ted Kaczynski 's home . Accompanied by a FBI agent , each of the three was led one at a time to the door of the 10- by 12-foot cabin . It was crammed with books , boxes , jars , and-ominously-chemicals . A later inventory would reveal that the chemicals included bottles of sulfur , saltpeter , ammonium nitrate , and sodium chlorate ; the boxes contained zinc , aluminum , and lead . One old cereal box contained 23 bomb igniters , each made from a piece of cord pulled through a wooden plug . Other boxes contained batteries ; wiring ; and pieces of metal , copper , and plastic pipe . The cabin lacked running water , electricity , and a bathroom . It had a pot-bellied stove for heat ; a table , a chair , and what appeared to be an army cot were the only furniture . The bomb was under the cot . All three also noticed two other items lying in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sketch of the suspect , which had been widely circulated in the media . The sketch was based on an eyewitness description following a February 1987 bombing in Salt Lake City . The cabin and all of its contents would be saved as evidence , but the first order of business was to get the bomb out of the cabin and moved to a safe location . The bomb , like many of the Unabomber 's past devices , was packaged in a rectangular wooden box , the size of a thick book , that would fit inside a mailbox . Cherry 's team constructed wooden ramps up and into the cabin , and a remote-controlled robot carefully carried the device to a nearby field . The bomb was then placed on a wooden stool ; the team built an igloo of heavy timbers around the stool , covering the structure with a blue tarp held down by sandbags . Nobody was overly concerned that the bomb would detonate while it was being moved , because Kaczynski 's bombs were always designed to explode when they were opened . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any explosion , with the blue tarp acting like a big tablecloth to capture any forensic crumbs . The cabin , meanwhile , turned out to be a treasure trove of clues . Perhaps most important were 10 notebooks authored by Kaczynski . " His notebooks were like a technical memoir , " says Cherry . " My main focus was on how he thought about explosives and bombs . He had a very elaborate set of notes written in Spanish . It was just unbelievable . " // Simple but Deadly // Simple but Deadly // Disrupting the Bomb // Fortunately , Cherry was able to have Kaczynski 's notes immediately translated , and what he learned helped him understand Kaczynski 's approach to bombmaking and gave him great cause for concern . " His notes told me that he was a mathematician , " says Cherry . " In one entry , he was trying to calculate heat transfer on a bridge wire of the type used in detonators , looking at the electric current relationship involved . He was looking at bomb-building from a scientific viewpoint . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be informed that Kaczynski had received a Harvard degree at 20 , earned a doctorate at the University of Michigan , and had been a mathematics professor at the University of California , Berkeley . His mathematical treatises , published in the 1960s , were considered by his peers to be the work of a genius . The notebooks only confirmed what Cherry already knew . Kaczynski was a formidable bomb builder who had improved his technique with each succeeding device between 1978 and 1995 . Cherry also was one of the few people who realized that Kaczynski had recently achieved a technical breakthrough that doubled the destructive power of his bombs without increasing the size of the package . Cherry says this technique was known to only a small number of people , and that number did not include any FBI agents . " Kaczynski was right on target , technically , " says Cherry . " What amazed me was that this guy was doing all this by himself . You 're dealing with a guy who has no electricity . He 's using hand tools . But at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deadly . As he progresses , the fatalities increase . " Cherry was also impressed with Kaczynski 's patience . Every component of his bombs was handmade . " He may have spent weeks working on one little component . He was so careful about not leaving a trace , other than the Freedom Club inscription . " Poisson agrees with Cherry 's assessment . " It was very clear that Kaczynski thought out each and every minor detail , and had probably gone through extensive testing of each device . He was truly unique . " Ironically , Poisson , Cherry , and Kaczynski all had the same hobby in high school : building fireworks . The team decided that the job would be handled in two phases : The first would render the bomb inactive , while the bomb would be dismantled in phase two . " Our goal was to go backward from the completed item to what was existing on the table when it was started , " explains Poisson . Phase two would be as dangerous as phase one , however , since many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at bombs within a bomb . By Sunday , the team was ready to begin disarming the bomb , but only after spending most of the preceding night arguing about how to proceed-a discussion punctuated by lack of sleep and too much coffee . Each team member had a different opinion . X-ray imaging systems had provided them with some idea of the interior layout of the bomb , but the two-dimensional pictures proved hard to interpret in three dimensions , so the exact location of the triggering device was difficult to pin down . " The whole device was hard to interpret , " says Owenby . " Things in it were odd , and the way it was put together was odd . " The team was at an impasse . The FBI liaison , Tom J. Mohnall , an explosives examiner from the FBI 's laboratory in Washington , D.C. , looked at Cherry . " You 're in charge . You 're calling the shots . " Cherry 's interpretation of the bomb 's interior would stand . The gear needed for the job was ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the equipment they use , concerned that such knowledge may give future bombers an edge . Much of it , however , involves remote video systems and robotic manipulators of various sizes that can be operated from a safe distance . " The days when you see a guy cutting a red or green wire , like in the movies , are over , " says Cherry . " We can do that type of task from a mile away . " One key device , in use for only a few years and invented by Cherry under an FBI contract , is called the Percussion Actuated Nonelectric ( PAN ) disrupter . It hovers over the bomb like a praying mantis about to devour a bug . " It basically allows us to use an explosive to disarm an explosive , " says Cherry , but that is as much as he will say about it , even though it is now used by bomb squads nationwide since the FBI distributed 500 free of charge last year . As described by Patrick J. Webb , a counter-terrorism supervisor for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracked the Unabomber since 1982 , the PAN disrupter is a long narrow stainless steel tube about an eighth of an inch in diameter , through which many different kinds of high-powered charges can be fired . The shock tube , as it is called , is manufactured in lengths up to 5,000 feet , so it can be cut to any desired length , letting the bomb squad remain at a safe distance from the explosive . When fired with a basic black powder round , as was used in this case , the PAN disrupter creates a flash that looks like a bolt of lightning , signaling that a shock wave is traveling down the tube . When the device performs correctly-Webb ca n't recall it ever misfiringthe shock wave will disable a key component of the bomb , such as the trigger , timer , or battery . The PAN disrupter , says Webb , is the only scientifically verified tool available to bomb technicians . It has been tested so many times with a variety of charges that technicians need only consult a guidebook that will correlate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and stand-off distance in which to use the disrupter . Fortunately , most bombs seen in the United States , about half of which are pipe bombs , are of simple construction . " We have n't seen a ramping up of sophisticated technology , " says Webb . " We 're still in the bomber Stone Age . " Nevertheless , he acknowledges , the Unabomber had proved how deadly even primitive materials can be in a bomber 's hands . With the PAN disrupter in place , Cherry allowed Jim Freeman , head of the FBI 's San Francisco office and who , along with Terry D. Turchie , headed the Unabomber investigation , to fire the device . " Is it going to be loud ? " asked Freeman . " We hope it is a quiet , joyful noise , " replied Owenby . A few seconds later , a small , muffled thump caused all three team members to grin . Cherry was the first to inspect the Unabomber package . The operation was a success : The package had barely moved . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was defused , " says Cherry . Phase one was over . As expected , phase two proved more difficult . The team had prepared a number of special tools for the task of dismantling the bomb , most of which were invented for the assignment and would n't be immediately comprehensible even to your average bomb technician . Again , the team is circumspect about details . " We may need certain technologies tomorrow , " says Owenby . Still , what the team knew about the Unabomber 's previous bombs was n't reassuring . " He was unusual in that most bombers have a particular way of doing business , " says Poisson . " He was exceptionally difficult to deal with , because he did whatever appealed to him at the time . " Adding to the difficulty were the Unabomber 's handmade components , which included even the screws . Kaczynski 's homemade glues were manufactured from animal hooves and tended to react unpredictably compared with store-bought material . In taking apart a bomb , the general idea is to apply heat extremely slowly over a period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a degree , in the hope that this will cause the components to eventually separate . The difficulty with this approach is that the bombs tend to be so tightly constructed that moving even a single element takes a precise amount of energy . Too much heat or too much movement will cause an explosion . Each move on the bomb prompted a lot of discussion , but slowly the components begin to peel away , one by one , much as the team had expected based on their analysis of previous Unabomber devices . Then they hit a wall . " This guy was unbelievably clever , " says Cherry . " We trained so that when we got to any given point , we would know a certain set of tools and gear were needed . Well , guess what ? He threw us for a 180-degree turn . We said : ' Now what do we do ? " ' Cherry wo n't say exactly what the problem was , for security reasons , but he likens it to expecting to see something in liquid form , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup you brought is useless . Nothing in the technicians ' toolbox would allow them to proceed . Cherry felt as if he were on third base , prepared to score the winning run of the baseball game , only to learn that all the bats were now broken . Poisson , the team 's primary gadget maker , was undeterred . After studying the problem for the better part of a day , Poisson stole into a nearby farmer 's toolshed while its owner was away , and improvised a tool on the spot . Working with an untested tool can be extremely dangerous , and Poisson recalled the old bomb squad adage : " It 's either initial success or complete failure . " Nonetheless , the team decided to continue . Making matters worse , the bomb began to behave erratically . An initial application of heat would yield no reaction , then suddenly there would be a spike in the temperature reading that could cause an explosion . Heat was dissipating from one part of the bomb but not from another . No one knew the temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose , and the team backed off until the device cooled . Again and again , they followed the same procedure . " Add energy " and " stop " became a mantra . After each pause , Cherry would personally inspect the bomb , looking for signs of discoloration or residue buildup . " The TV systems could give us a look but they could n't tell us certain things , " says Cherry . " We needed a threedimensional view of how the energy was affecting the device . Every second , we were concerned because we were putting so much energy into something that was so sensitive . And we did n't know exactly how sensitive it was . I could only speculate on what I saw , what was in Kaczynski 's notes , and what I thought we had , based on my past experience . " Slowly , over a period of hours that stretched into one nerve-wracking day after another , the bomb came apart . Poisson 's untested , jerry-rigged tool had worked like a charm . Nine days had passed since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by piece , they had handed over the Unabomber 's last bomb into evidence . A little more than two years later , on May 4 , 1998 , Ted Kaczynski pleaded guilty in federal court in Sacramento , California , and was sentenced to life imprisonment without any possibility of parole . By agreeing to the plea , Kaczynski avoided the death penalty . The case never came to trial . The dismantled bomb was never presented to the court , and it 's stored at the FBI 's Washington , D.C. , lab . Kaczynski 's cabin now sits in a warehouse in a former Air Force base outside of Sacramento . Photograph The Unabomber 's mountain cabin , built in 1971 , was both his home and laboratory , yet it was small enough to be carried away by investigators . // <p>
