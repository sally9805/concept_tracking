WHAT JOSHUA FEINEMAN invented back in ' 02 was a sly little shortcut of a subroutine that programmers and other code-cutters who communicate mostly in Prolog or C++ , with an occasional lapse into Lisp or such vulgates as FORTRAN or APL , called , simply , nifty . <p> Josh 's colleagues in the Mathematical Physics Department called it elegant , which , Josh thought , had to be the only term of art common to interior decorators and scientists . Then he recalled the " charm " of the high-energy physicists . <p> " Invented is n't really the right word , " Josh told Rainey Clarke one August night four years later during a quiet moment in their busy fumble from a relationship based on exuberant sex into a love based on a complex skein of feelings , opinions , prejudices , mutual kindnesses and psychological mysteries which they had come to believe was worth spending the rest of their lives exploring . " Discovered is what I did , " he said . <p> " And that 's how come you 're so rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the last of the evening 's Perseids and burrowed down into the twin sleeping bag they shared in the cold Sierra night and bit Josh gently on the shoulder . <p> " That 's how . . . ouch ! . . . come , " he said , rolling over and wrestling Rainey to an uncontested cross-body pin , his hands locking her arms , elbows akimbo , in parentheses around her oval face and its frame of auburn curls . " That 's why now that I 've got you my cup runneth damn near over . " <p> " What do you mean , got me ? What do you mean , damn near ? " <p> He stared down at her grinning face , her eyes bright in the clear high-country starlight , one heavy brow cocked in the skepticism with which , he had come to realize , she greeted the good things in her life . And then he kissed her . Since they had known each other for six months , been lovers for half that time , been three days hiking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sleeping bag earlier that night and the past two hours gazing in awe at the August display of meteorites , it was the kind of lingering kiss that saluted the complexities ahead more than the simple urgencies of the past . <p> Josh rolled onto his back and caught one late flash across the sky . Rainey asked , " Okay , Joshua me lad , what do you mean about your cup ? Am I not your perfect love ? And how rich are you ? Are you New Century Genentech rich ? You ' 90 's rich ? Sam Walton Rich ? Up there with the Golden Gates ? " <p> " Nah . " <p> " ' 80 's rich ? Trump rich ? Up there with the S &L; barons ? " <p> " Look , all I did was figure out a quick little way of doing something . Maybe a bunch of people do n't have to hit a couple of back slashes anymore . Maybe a lot of them only hit the dot on a keyboard when they want a period or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah , " said Rainey , slyly readying herself to counterattack . " But however modest your contribution to  --  what 'd you tell me , practically every operating system ?  --  someone keeps paying you big bucks to use it , right ? You got ta be some kind of a genius . " <p> " Yeah . Well I 'm not . I was drunk , sitting around getting pissed with three of my grad students . I 'd broken the little finger on my left hand playing third base in a dumb pickup game at the department picnic that afternoon and it was all splinted up and I was full of Demerol and scotch after we stopped off there in Piggotti 's on the way back from the emergency room , which is this little bar about a mile down Fresno Avenue from the campus , and I was somehow convinced that I was gon na lose the goddamn thing , my finger , and I started to count them with This Little Pig Went to Market and I only got up to four , the one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd have to whack off the same finger on the other hand so 's they 'd , you know , match , and that started me thinking in octal and the first thing I knew I was saying , son of a bitch , that 's it . " Josh paused for breath . <p> " And ? " <p> " And I was just barely sober enough to write it down on a cocktail napkin . Been the little finger on my right hand , nothing would 've come of it ' cause I ca n't write shit left handed . So it 's all just dumb luck . " <p> With Josh busy in memory , Rainey attacked , rolling swiftly on top of him and pinning him , the action again only lightly contested , and she returned the kiss , hers only a little less complex , a little more basic . When they came up for air , she rolled back to cuddle against his chest and said , " Okay , if you 're so rich , how come you ai n't smart ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're so beautiful and witty and kind and courteous and obedient and loyal and  --  I forget the rest of that Boy Scout crap  --  how come you 're inside an L. L. Bean sleeping bag 4,000 feet up in a frosty meadow thirty miles south of Lake Tahoe wrapped around a skinny naked thirty-something beardy professor of mathematics from a fairly undistinguished new university who has always been a hell of a lot luckier at cards than at love ? " <p> " Money , honey , " said Rainey , now sleepy . <p> " I thought so . " <p> " And watch it with that ' obedient ' stuff . " <p> " Yes ma'am . " <p> A little later , almost asleep , Rainey mumbled , " So you 're rich an ' I 'm your love ' n your cup still i' n't full , huh ? " <p> " Not quite . Close . " <p> " Whatcha want you have n't got ? " <p> Josh was a long , thoughtful moment replying , and when he finally did so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Want to get back to doing some good , " he said , " without buying it . " <p> Among the night 's Perseids was the hulk of one of five Command-and-Control vessels of a fleet of nearly a thousand starships launched at a time unthinkably long ago in the second punitive campaign of an intergalactic entity whose name is inexpressible . Its microbiotic crew long reduced to nanometric motes , its strange , organic fabric tenuous , the minuscule remaining mass of the C-and-C produced little flash as all but its intricate and indestructible prime mover vaporized in the lower stratosphere . That tiny remaining solid core of long-dormant sub-atomic energies and relativistic control synapses slowed , cooled , cycled upward and downward in an early morning west-bound thunderhead , just another hygroscopic kernel of dust , and  --  when it had accumulated the necessary mass of ice  --  plunged in precipitation . It struck just hard enough to break skin , penetrating some fraction over a millimeter , twice its diameter , into the nape of a sleep-fuddled camper on the Pacific Crest Trail . <p> Josh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and burrowed down out of the first few drops of rain into the warm , dry double bag , spooning . <p> The prime mover , suddenly bathed in a rich broth of free ions and proximate to all sorts of ambient energy , powered back up into operation , went through a self-diagnosis that took the better part of one revolution of the planet that now bore it and its new vessel , found all in order , and settled into standby mode to wait for instructions , prepared to accept them couched in almost any intelligible signal . <p> Fifteen years earlier , in the last month of her senior year at Jefferson High , Rainey had thought she knew the three things that would fill tier cup : marriage to some really cool and studly dude like Chuck Bingham , a neat little kid like her four-year-old nephew Petey , and a good career in something major , like maybe fashion merchandising or even modeling . <p> " Same three I still want , " she said to Detective Sergeant Amanda Forburg , a high school friend she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was paying her an unexpected visit in her tiny lab in the Jefferson County Sheriff 's Office on the afternoon after her return from the Pacific Crest . <p> " Got the cute little kid , " she said , " only he 's almost fourteen years old and worried about making it in a mean school and otherwise a serious , industrial-strength pain in the ass , which is to say he is a thirteen-year-old kid . " <p> " Yeah , know about the kid , " said Sergeant Forburg . " And you got the career , I mean , like , Chief of Criminalistics even in a jerkwater place like Jeff County , that 's not too shabby , Rainey . " <p> " I guess . Two techs and a contract M.E. who comes in on call . No big deal but it probably beats modeling . I was too big in the butt anyway . " <p> " And the third thing ? " said Forburg . " The great love affair ? " <p> " Yeah . Had that too . For a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember Charlie Bingham ?  --  he was n't done screwing around , and when I caught him at it , I was too young to deal with it . Probably still am . " <p> " Caught him , like , in flagrante ? " said Forburg , who- with a degree in Criminal Justice  --  had a taste for legalisms . <p> " More like in Florence , " said Rainey . " You remember Flo Anderson ? She was one of my best friends in high school . " <p> Forburg grinned . " One thing us gays learn is that when you grow up , lover and best friend better be the same thing . " <p> " Yeah , but you do n't have a patent on the idea . Anyway , you asked about what I been up to since we graduated . I did that stuff and then the Police Corps and college when they finally funded it and here I am . How about you , Mandy ? " <p> " I guess I could say like my morn used to , been there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no kid , and after the guy hauled ass , I began to understand who I really was . Did a deuce in the Army . MPs . Was n't asked , did n't tell . Got out after the Irish Pacification thing in ' 01 and went to Sac State with a GI grant . Hired in at Jeff City PD in ' 04 and took the Sergeant 's exam last year . " <p> " You married ? " <p> " Yeah . Mary Alice is manager of the Penney 's over in Hillsborough . " Forburg 's grin was beatific . " But how about you , Rain ? Ever find a replacement for your  --  ah  --  studly dude ? " <p> " Was n't that something ? Can you imagine the words we used ? But , yeah . I think so . Got one kind of on hold . " <p> " He in law enforcement ? " <p> " Professor . Great guy . I think I 'm nuts about him . Think he 's nuts about me . " <p> " So ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got some  --  uh  --  problems we got to work through . " <p> " He does n't get along with the kid ? You not sure you like him enough to make it permanent ? " <p> " No . No doubts there in either . It 's just that he 's like the rest of us , took one bad fall in the marriage department and he 's , like , kind of gun-shy . " She laughed to cover her concerns . Why was she telling Mandy all this ? Something about old friends not seen for a long time . . . . <p> " And then , more important , " Rainey continued . " he 's lousy rich , lots of bucks , and I 'm not sure I know how to handle that . " <p> Forberg laughed . " You 'll get used to it . Trust me . " <p> Rainey nodded . " Yeah , I think I will , but it takes some thinking . I do n't want to give up all this . " She waved her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tile , the battered metal furniture loaded with paper and abused apparatus , the scabrous green walls . " And he 's got kind of another problem too . " <p> " They usually do , do n't they . What ? Stumbled on the twelfth step and still falls on his ass Saturday nights ? Steals ladies ' panties from the Laundromat ? " <p> Rainey 's smile displayed a bride 's mix of current joy and anticipated concern . " Nothing that simple . Says he wants to  --  uh  --  do some good in the world . Be a hero or something . Not just give money away , which he does a whole lot . " <p> " Wow , " said Forburg , irony in her voice . " Rich is a problem . " <p> They sat in silence for a moment , sobered by memory . Then Rainey  --  seeing Forburg fidget , suddenly prescient , frightened , her throat tightening  --  said , " So , Mandy . What brings you around after all these years ? " <p> Forburg had trouble making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm the one has to do this , but the boss figured it might come better from a  --  uh  --  friend . What I 'm doing right now is working on another problem you got . " <p> " Oh shit , " said Rainey , her heart sinking . " Tommy ? " <p> Forburg opened her over-the-shoulder , removed a plastic evidence bag , and placed it with a dull clunk on Rainey 's scarred desk . It contained one of the shabby Chinese ripoffs of the Smith &; Wesson Model 911 9mm that had inundated American streets in the previous two years , one of many unanticipated benefits of the inclusion of the People 's Republic of China in GATT II . " Weapons sweep this rooming at Broadmoor Middle School turned up a couple dozen of these . Took this one off one Thomas Jay Bingham , NOK listed as Rainey Clarke . " <p> " Oh goddamn ! " said Rainey , tears of fear and frustration welling in her eyes . <p> Josh noticed the difference when he rose just before noon on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the detour through Modesto to pick up Rainey 's son from her sister 's home . They had parted after midnight , Rainey giving him a chaste peck on the cheek as Tommy sleepily grumbled his way through the front door of the two bedroom condo he shared with his mother . <p> The difference Josh noticed was that when he gave his habitual hard jerk on the shower stall door that had been stuck and he had been meaning to fix since some time back in the Clinton administration , the door shattered with a rattling vitreous cascade like the sound the trash recycling track wakes you with when it picks up in front of your house the Monday after a party weekend . Startled , he stood naked and shivering , harmless fragments of tempered glass piled on his feet , the aluminum door frame twisted like a bizarre paper clip . Broken free of the assembly , the round aluminum handle rested quietly , warmly , in his hand . <p> His mathematician 's keen analytical mind went , huh ? <p> Aloud , with professorial precision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bemused , intrigued , he stepped gingerly around the ruins , showered , dressed , and swept up , replaying that single strange moment again and again , looking for some explanation better than , huh ? As he pondered , he prepared and consumed a brunch of crackers , elderly cheese , and cold cereal and milk . He moved gingerly , very careful when he pried open the milk carton 's spout and applied knife to hardened Edam . <p> Time for a little experimental verification . He stepped into the garden behind his modest suburban house  --  a souvenir of his brief unpleasant marriage back in ' 96  --  and picked up the first disposable object he saw , a whitewashed rock the size of his fist , one of many edging a neglected bed of Allium . He pictured himself playing third base , scooping up a baseline grounder and trying to throw out that hulking sonorabitch in Condensed Matter at second , about the distance from where he stood to the stout grapestake fence that marked the rear of the lot . He threw . Flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back fence . A little more than a second later a mature oak over in the next block shivered and shook leaves and birds from its crown . <p> Josh whistled a long exclamation . He grubbed up another rock and lofted it over a neighbor 's house toward the gray outline of the coast range forty miles away in the direction of Coalinga . Without perceptible trajectory , it diminished to a cobblestone , a pebble , a grain of sand , and disappeared . He picked up a third stone and reduced it to sand without throwing it , squeezing it in his hand . <p> How can flesh and blood . . . ? he wondered , and then realized that there had been only superficial contact between M. Joshua Feineman and any of the stones , that something in or around Josh was doing the work , handling the abrasion , exerting the force , impelling the objects . Not Josh himself . <p> He whistled again , pulled a battered aluminum fungo bat from the canvas sack of gear he kept inside the back door and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pulled it back out again , and bent it double . <p> Rich and fucking powerful too ! His mind filled with visions of Spandex-clad Marvel Comics superheroes from his youth . <p> He heard the phone in the kitchen ring and went in to answer it , the twelve - year- old in him that is the default persona in most men making him swagger a little but the rest of him walking on eggs , mindful of the screen door , which had a tendency to stick on damp days . <p> THE TELEPHONE call brought a distracted , uncharacteristically self-absorbed Josh to a tiny mud-colored waiting room in the Family Support Division of the Jefferson County District Attorney 's Office where Rainey embraced him wordlessly and thanked him with wounded eyes . They sat together on a hard bench until a uniformed deputy led in Tommy , his wrists joined in front of him with plastic ties more to humiliate than to restrain him . They waited then , Rainey between the two people she most loved and least understood , until they could be interviewed by the Assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember ever feeling such dismay . First the recurrent problem with Tom my  --  God only knew how that would turn out  --  and now Josh was acting weird , twitchy , distant . She had called , asked him to accompany her through the painful process ahead , not because she needed support  --  she had too long been a successful single parent to lose heart now  --  but because she feared for Tommy and his failing adjustment to the violent society of the public schools . <p> Not a gender thing , she thought . A generation thing . Schools had been rough enough when she was a teenager , scary sometimes , but not . . . Christ ! . . . perilous , deadly ! She wanted Tommy to have some touchstone to the new schoolboy reality that he faced , that she felt inadequate to counsel him on . Maybe a teacher , even a college professor , could help . Josh 's willingness to support her was , she knew , limitless . The best friend she had ever had . Maybe skinny , kindly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could give something to her tough little boy , whose attitude toward his mother 's lover  --  typically enough  --  had thus far peaked at grudging tolerance . <p> She peered at her tall , sullen son from the comer of her eye . He looked ordinary enough , dressed in the teen uniform of the day . His battered Styrofoam cyclist 's helmet , pushed back on his head at a precise angle , was covered with swastikas and garish daggers in the virulent pinks and blues of the tattoo artist . An oversize white Guayaberra shirt fell halfway to his knees over electric chartreuse cyclist 's tights swallowed in sculled vinyl high toppers . No more bizarre , she supposed , than the reversed baseball caps , topiary haircuts , and sagging skateboard baggies worn by her teenage brother and his friends a dozen years earlier . <p> The Assistant Prosecutor was a large frazzled black woman named Tamara Shakul who , only four years out of Hastings Law School , had already built a reputation for dealing with kids in trouble . Rainey had worked up the forensics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . <p> " What we got , " said Shakul , seating them in her office and acknowledging the adults but addressing Tommy , " is a violation of California Penal Code Section 12101 , Possession of a Concealable Firearm by a Minor . That 's any usable handgun . You know what I 'm telling you Thomas ? " <p> Rainey 's hand found one of Tommy 's , squeezed hard . " Uh , yes . . . " Squeezed again . " . . . ma'am . " <p> Shakul nodded and continued , her language an expressive mix of legalisms and street lingo . " Okay , you know from last time you were in here that 's a misdemeanor that can get you jugged up to a year in a boot camp if you 're lucky with the judge or in Juvenile Hall if you 're not . You follow me ? You know what I 'm sayin ' ? " <p> No hand squeeze was necessary . Tommy was frightened . " Yes , ma'am . " <p> " Thing is , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you in mind and they put a little wiggle room in it . You get the first one free if no felony is involved , nobody did anything with the piece . It 's the second one and any subsequent ones gets you the time in the slammer . " <p> Tommy swallowed . <p> " And you used up your first one last March , did n't you ? " <p> Tommy nodded . Got the hand squeeze . Said , " Yeah . Yes ma'am . " <p> " So this time is number two and you will , I repeat , you will do some time . " <p> Shakul removed the automatic from the evidence bag , ejected the clip and with casual expertise worked the slide and sighted to make sure the chamber was clear . She laid the weapon on her desk in front of Tommy . " I 'm not goin ' to ask you where you got this . Not goin ' to ask you to rat on any of your little buddies . I know how you kids think , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I want to have this interview with you in front of your morn , let you know how the law sees what you 're gettin ' into . Give you a chance to think about it . Maybe work up somethin ' you can use with the judge , get a little break here ' cause your mom 's in law enforcement . " <p> Her voice grew brusque , more commanding . " The way the law gon na figure this , either you bought this piece of cheap Chinese shit ' cause you goin ' to use it in what the law calls ' pursuit of an unlawful act , ' like knock over a 7-Eleven or pop somebody been givin ' you a hard time . In which case I got nothin ' more to say to you and I 'll see you later when they drag your sorry ass in here again on a felony rap or on the third misdemeanor , which they absolutely , positively , most certainly will eventually do . " Her voice rose to a swallowed shout , like an umpire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Count on it ! " <p> Then in a quiet , confiding tone : " Or what 's more likely with kids like you that 've got folks who care for ' em and look after ' em is that you 're scared ' cause about every other kid in school and especially the losers and dealers are carryin ' , and that 's why you think you need some kinda protection . In which case , I 'm telling you in front of your folks that this damn thing is no kind of protection at all and that the best way of gettin ' your head blown off is to walk around with one of these in your pocket . " <p> They sat in silence . Rainey was horrified . She stared at the sweat on her son 's pale forehead . It seemed only yesterday that she had seen the same sweat as the petulant mouth below it worked at her breast . She was startled then when Josh , strangely calm and surprisingly authoritative , reached across to pick up the pistol . He examined it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gesture that was almost lascivious , pausing at the muzzle as if to gauge its width , and then held it up for Tommy to see . <p> " Tom , " he said , his voice steady , low-key , a touch of the classroom demonstrator in it , " take a look at the barrel . See that ? Can you see how the muzzle on this thing is so far out of round it 's practically squeezed shut ? " <p> Rainey thought : He knows what he 's doing . I can see why everybody says he 's a good teacher . He talks to Tommy without sounding patronizing . <p> Josh bent his head next to Tommy 's ; both fixed their attention on the matte black of the automatic as if it were a toy locomotive , an airplane model , a circuit board . " What do you think ? " said Josh . " Looks to me like somebody whacked it with maybe a sledge hammer . " <p> Tommy nodded soberly . <p> " Anyone try firing this puppy , it 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a hand and probably a lot of other stuff too , do n't you think ? " <p> Tommy nodded again , a physician concurring with a first opinion . <p> " Not a usable firearm , Tom . Would n't think it 'll count for a second misdemeanor . But still not a good idea to carry something like this mound , is it . " <p> Tommy said , " No sir . " <p> Rainey looked up at Shakul . The Assistant Prosecutor was slowly nodding every bit as surprised as the boy by the unfireable condition of the gun . <p> Different purpose this trip into the high Sierra a week after the first one ; three individual sleeping bags around embers in a fire ring in Troy Meadows , the Sequoia National Forest . <p> It had been a great day , thought Tom Bingham as he squirmed into his bag for the night . Great week . Josh had some neat moves , stuff he did that was hard to figure . Like what he 'd done with that 9mm he 'd bought from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him off the hook with the cops . Never again ! <p> And Josh was more fun than most grown-ups , listened to stuff and understood what you were trying to say . Knew all kinds of shit too , could explain major stuff like rocks and stars and kinds of trees so it was real interesting knew how to , like , deal with things . <p> He imagined when he got home what he would tell Pinky and Scott about the time that morning he finally asked Josh how come they could talk together , do stuff together like he could n't with other adults . <p> " I 'm , like , is it one of those guy kinda things ? " he would tell them . " And Josh , he 's my mom 's squeeze , he goes , Nah , what they call guy stuff is really boy stuff . And then Josh , he says : cool people outgrow that crap . " Tom 's daydream descended into night and he drifted off into a sleep undisturbed by the raw , visceral fear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elementary school . <p> Rainey had a mother 's sense for her child , knew when he had dropped into sleep . She rose far enough out of her bag to lean across to kiss Josh quickly and feel his response , his hand on the back of her head . Snuggling back into warmth , she thought : I got the career and I got the dude and I got the kid , and maybe with Josh to help , he is n't going to be as much of a problem as I thought . And yes , I can deal with the bucks , although there is something about old Joshua-me-love that is different . . . . <p> Josh smiled at the kiss , wondered how he was going to deal with what was happening to him but feeling new confidence in his relationship with Rainey and the boy . It had been a weird week , to say the least . At night and in private moments in his locked garage and alone on the trail earlier that day , he had done some more experimenting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sped amazingly , and heaved great weights in astonishing ways . But at best  --  like the thing with the 9mm  --  these were just parlor tricks , sometimes requiring unusually large parlors . They were like the money ; nice to have but not all that interesting to use . . . . <p> In a flash of self-awareness he was not introspective enough to recognize as such , he realized that his cup was truly running over now , not on account of Rainey 's love or parenting her boy or being rich and able to leap tall buildings and twist metal with his bare hands , but because of . . . the right words welled up , a shard of memory from some freshman lit course . . . because of " little , nameless , unremembered acts of kindness and of love " he had recently committed , without spending a buck or bending a fungo bat . <p> A little smug in his own virtue , anticipating a future of wealth and power and insight and domestic bliss , he scratched absently at the welt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a humongous mosquito bite the week before . Must be infected , he thought , as he absently squeezed at the swelling . He felt the pressure release , rolled over , and slept . <p> The next morning he had a terrible time getting the cap unscrewed from his water bottle . <p> <p> By Robin Wilson <p> Robin Wilson 's most recent novel is a mystery , Death by Degrees , His most recent non-fiction book is a sequel to his well-received 1973 SF text-anthology , Those Who Can .
