<p> THE GAME of baseball is too strong to die . It will survive on the fields of American youth and in the dreams of anyone who fancies hitting that ball over the fence . But the " national pastime " was put to rest yesterday , extinguished by a group of men who did n't seem to notice . <p> Our romance with the game had already been in peril , soured by greed and arrogance and a labor crisis too senseless to understand . But now there is no World Series , and the breakup will be easy . Even for those willing to maintain a friendship , things will never be quite the same . <p> Major league baseball is a blackened wasteland now , still simmering from the fires that killed it . The ballparks are empty , the fans do n't care , and the executors of this disaster are left to ponder what they 've done . Incredibly , they have no idea . They 've been too busy hating each other . Save the game ? Never came into play . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Nobody dreads these circumstances more than I do , " said the acting commissioner , Bud Selig . " This is a terrible day . " <p> OH , COME on , Bud . This is a great day for you . The owners stayed unified ! Was n't that your whole point ? Sure , it might take 10 years to restore the game 's dignity , but what the hell , you guys are a team now ! What 's the delay , man , champagne for everybody ! <p> This must be what Selig , Jerry Reinsdorf and the other blind hyenas of ownership had in mind  --  to kill the pastime  --  because they certainly did a masterful job . Wear your reputation well , guys . In a perfect world , you will be scorned , hooted and ridiculed for the rest of your lives . <p> Only slightly less pathetic are the players , who stood placidly as the whole thing unraveled . But if you 're among those who blame the players for everything , try to think this through . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Fellas , we 've earned way too much over the years . Let 's give back what we 've fought for . " Until you acknowledge that basic principle of American labor , you do n't have a full grip on the situation . And until your own job expectancy shrinks from 40 or 50 years to maybe five or six , do n't blame the players for defending the status quo . <p> INCREDIBLY , the players had almost nothing to do with this . They did n't want to bail out . They simply did what they were told , and they took comfort in their unanimity . What , you have a grudge against Dennis Eckersley now ? Rod Beck ? They could n't be more innocent . They 've just been sitting around , waiting for their latest Christmas package . Except this time , it never came . <p> If the players are at fault for anything , it 's choosing the wrong leaders . They went into this battle with Donald Fehr , one of the really big jerks of our time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press conferences . Fehr is not only annoying by nature , he fails to surround himself with level-headed people . He enters the fray with a bunch of lawyers , concerned more about numbers than history , and bitterly confrontational ex-players like Mark Belanger . <p> " Screw you ! " management said during the entirety of this strike . <p> " Oh , yeah ? Screw you ! " said the players ' negotiating team . That 's your behind-the-scenes look at the whole thing . It was n't much more complicated than that . <p> There is n't one impressive thing about the owners sticking together . It is sad , embarrassing , inexcusable . The only way they could have saved baseball would be to find some common sense from a Peter O'Malley , Peter Magowan , or anyone else with a shred of integrity . Except , our main man Bud Selig did n't allow any contrary thought . He orchestrated this thing from the beginning . The owners are unified , all right . Unified in hell . <p> Do n't waste your time wondering why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to the players ' rescue , as they do so well on game days . They were n't even remotely involved . Selig is the man who killed baseball . He not only presided over the apocalypse , he left an incriminating trail of evidence . <p> SELIG 'S ROLE <p> To hear the best sources tell it , Selig led the fight to unseat commissioner Fay Vincent , who knew the game could n't logically be controlled by its least successful teams . Selig opened the negotiations a year early , back in December of ' 92 , then failed to put forth a salary-cap proposal until this June . He was behind the owners ' withholding a $ 7.8 million pension payment due the union from receipts of the All-Star game , setting an irrevocable tone of acrimony . Then he helped talk the union into playing that game , not striking , so the new television contract could kick in . <p> Selig is the guy who announced that 19 teams were losing money and then , under scrutiny , revised it to " 12 or 13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Tom Werner of the Padres and Carl Pohlad of the Twins , two men who are leaving baseball and would therefore defend a salary cap to the end . Selig called off a potentially significant owners ' meeting two weeks ago because he feared dissent . He methodically alienated O'Malley , a man who always used to make a difference . He told so many lies over the last two weeks , it became impossible to take him seriously . And his salary for all of this wonderful work ? A flat $ 1 million per year . <p> Selig is also an owner . He 's the commissioner , and he 's an owner . No problem there , I guess . Hell , if Congress removed baseball 's antitrust exemption , Bud Selig would go to jail . <p> NATIONAL LEADERS STAY QUIET <p> And let 's have a big hand , by the way , for the leaders of the land . Here 's what Clinton and Congress gave us : " Baseball strike ? This calls for immediate action . What do you think here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the union would n't break . How could they believe otherwise ? Sick as it may sound , this is the strongest union in the country . But they did not relent , put off the talks , or otherwise try to save the season . They killed it . In the process , they just might have killed themselves . <p> Nobody would have been thrilled by a postseason at this point , especially one devoid of a pennant race . But really , who would have been missing ? Oakland ? You 'd have the best teams in competition , the fans would eventually get into it ( no matter what they 're saying now ) , and the season could end on an upbeat note . The owners never realized that , and now they face a world of doom . <p> Even among the most benign organizations , front-office morale is shot . People have been fired , talked into retirement or laid off , and now many of them will quit altogether because they no longer believe in the product . It took years for teams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now they 're looking at a scene out of " Road Warrior . " Nobody in his right mind would seek employment with a major-league team right now . <p> EFFECT ON GIANTS , A 'S <p> If you 're Peter Magowan , you have to be a little bit in shock . Only months ago , you were the conquering hero with a sparkling team of investors , thrilling the baseball public with an entertaining team . Now what ? How can you sell season tickets if the ' 95 season is endangered ? What do you mean by season , exactly ? How can you plan spring training , solidify a television contract , lure in advertisers , convince your management group that everything is all right ? And what kind of team will you have if everyone on the 40-man roster stays on strike ? <p> The A 's are supposed to be getting all sorts of sympathy , but not from here . I admire the A 's for a decade of excitement , for their community involvement , for their all-around good sense . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lock on the World Series . But their money and their luck and their eye for talent ran out ; tough break . Now we 're supposed to support their hard-line stance in a plea for socialism ? In a labor crisis that killed the game ? Sorry . No chance . They have an amazingly dull baseball team and they 're trying to sell , as well they should . Hope they make a killing . <p> Now free to implement their salary cap ( although some technical hurdles remain ) , the owners seem to think the players will fold , welcoming the new system and gamboling into spring training like a bunch of puppy dogs . That would be crucial to the game 's stability , the only deterrent to utter chaos . But it is also highly unlikely , and if you 're like me , you do n't care a lick for either side now . It is time for judgment day . <p> I hope the small-market losers go completely out of business . They 're the ones who created this mess with their incessant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of manure . Either that or they do survive , even with no players , and then we can all laugh at their hollow threats of bankruptcy . They 'll try to take the field with minor-leaguers and a few scabs , and they 'll have the sorriest act in the entertainment business . " Tonight 's attendance : 2,639 . And thanks for coming . " <p> NEW LEAGUE <p> For the players , it would be time to consider a new league . There would be plenty of money , eager cities , blowhards at the podium , talk of a network-television deal , maybe even some timely court battles to gain possession of existing stadiums ( what case would the owners have , with their cities losing untold revenue ? ) . Hey , we do n't know if the Seattle Mariners will be in business , but we sure as hell know Ken Griffey will be playing baseball somewhere . <p> A new league , however , would be the surest path to ruin . The fans , media and potential advertisers are incredibly bitter already . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World Series , then the National and American Leagues . . . what 's next , aluminum bats and a three-ball walk ? A new league would go up in flames , self- igniting over the sheer heat of incompetence . And yes , that would be wonderful , too . <p> They have no idea what they 've done . It 's no longer a matter of kids staying up late enough to watch the Series . There is no Series , and baseball has told kids it could be wiped out again , at any time . Baseball is bogus to them , full of fakes and phonies . It has about as much credibility as two shirtless fat guys throwing a wrestling match . <p> The kids have lost baseball because the guy who runs WalMart , the Kansas City Royals ' chief executive , is having a tough go . Because Seattle spends millions to fix a dome that literally killed people . Because the Montreal Expos  --  merely the best team in the game  --  are crying poor . Because the Padres are the most mismanaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything , the successful owners did n't have the guts to defend themselves . It was n't Hitler , the Depression or a major earthquake that killed the national pastime , it was a onetime car salesman , Bud Selig , and a bunch of clowns in polyester pants . <p> I 'd like to congratulate a handful of realists who saw this coming all along . " There wo n't be a World Series , " they said back in July . " Bet you a hundred bucks there is , " I said . Silly me . I thought baseball still had a heart . Turns out it 's just a caldron of hate , in the custody of fools . I hope they all steam in their own waste .
