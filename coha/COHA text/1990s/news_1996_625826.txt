<p> One month from today , the Astros will begin spring training for what may be the most important season in franchise history . <p> It is a season in which many questions need to be answered about the future of the team in Houston , when the fans must respond to owner Drayton McLane 's attendance challenge if the city is going to keep professional baseball . <p> Having a winning team always is important , but this will be a season when the success of the Astros could decide whether the team stays in Houston . <p> If the team is winning , as most baseball followers expect , the attendance goal of 2.5 million has a decent chance of being reached . But if the team does not have a winning season , the drastic increase in attendance will be difficult to achieve . <p> " " There is pressure in professional sports every day , " said new Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker . " " Players learn to deal with it regardless of where it comes from . But I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That might happen with some people behind the scenes , but I do n't think it will on the field . " <p> On the field , the Astros could be one of the best teams in the National League . Aside from acquiring third baseman Sean Berry , the front office has n't made any significant changes . <p> But the Astros kept the player they had to keep in second baseman Craig Biggio and retained a young nucleus that missed the 1995 playoffs by one game . <p> Hunsicker recently acquired two pitchers - Houston product Anthony Young and John Johnstone - both of whom he knew from their days in the Mets organization . Both were highly touted prospects who have n't lived up to expectations , but Hunsicker believes both still have a chance to become quality big-league pitchers . <p> " " Obviously , I 'm trying to catch lightning in a bottle , " Hunsicker said . " " Both players have good arms , and they have experience . I give them a legitimate chance to make the club . " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trade rather than a free agent . It would n't be a major deal . I do n't want to tamper with the nucleus of our club . I like what we have . " <p> Hunsicker is happy with a projected every-day lineup of Brian Hunter in center field , Derek Bell in right , James Mouton and Derrick May platooning in left , Jeff Bagwell at first , Biggio at second , Orlando Miller at shortstop , Berry at third and Tony Eusebio sharing the catching duties with Rick Wilkins . <p> Hunsicker realizes his lineup is heavy with righthanded hitters , so he signed lefthanded-hitting infielder Bill Spiers last week as a player who might be able to fill a pinch-hitting role . Spiers , 29 , is a seven-year veteran who hit .208 last season in 63 games for the Mets . <p> Except for a minor addition or two , this appears to be the team the Astros will take to spring training . Here 's a look by position at how the team stacks up : <p> Starting pitchers - Based on last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The starters were 46-52 last season on a club that finished eight games over .500 . <p> Hunsicker admits he does n't feel as strong about the team 's pitching staff as he does about the position players . <p> " " I think we have enough ability there to have a solid year , " Hunsicker said . " " But you certainly can look at it and punch some holes because of recent performances . <p> " " We have to appeal to some of the people we have to step to the forefront in a way they have n't done in the past . You can look at our pitching situation two ways : You can say it 's half empty or you can say it 's half full . " <p> Based on 1995 , the half-full part of the rotation would be Shane Reynolds and Mike Hampton , two young pitchers who proved last year they can be quality big-league starters . <p> The half-empty part would be Doug Drabek , Greg Swindell and Darryl Kile . Drabek and Swindell were n't bad ( each was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team needs more from the two veterans . <p> Kile was 4-12 before being sent to the minors , and Swindell was taken out of the rotation in September . But Hunsicker said the team is n't going to Florida to have a tryout for starting pitchers . <p> " " As far as I 'm concerned , Darryl Kile is one of our starting pitchers , " Hunsicker said . " " It 's his job to lose . The same is true for Greg . But that does n't mean we wo n't get into spring training and have things change . " <p> A pitcher to watch is former first-round draft choice Billy Wagner , a lefthander with an explosive fastball . But the Astros are n't sure yet what role Wagner should have , or whether he 's ready to handle major-league hitters . <p> " " We certainly are open-minded on Wagner , " Hunsicker said . " " I think he is going to be a pitcher on this staff for a long time to come . But we have to take a long look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his best interest and the best interest of the team . We do n't want to sacrifice the future by rushing him to the big leagues . " <p> Bullpen - This was the team 's strength until the relievers tired down the stretch after having to pitch so many innings . But it wo n't be easy to find someone to replace Dave Veres , who was traded to Montreal for Berry . Veres , who was 5-1 with a 2.26 ERA , pitched in half the 144 games last season . <p> Young , Johnstone , Jim Dougherty , Dean Hartgraves and minor-leaguer Alvin Morman will have a chance to help fill Veres ' shoes . <p> But the biggest question is whether John Hudek can return from a rare surgical procedure to be the team closer again . Hudek had surgery last July to remove a rib that was causing circulation problems in his arm . <p> " " John has been working out at the Dome , and he says he feels good , " Hunsicker said . " " He is getting cabin fever because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very specific rehab program and is n't scheduled to throw hard until Feb. 1 . We expect him to be 100 percent . <p> " " A lot will depend on how he feels this spring , but in a perfect world , Hudek will be a closer and Todd Jones will be the setup man . " <p> If Hudek is n't ready , Jones will have to assume the closer role because the Astros did n't attempt to keep Mike Henneman , who signed with Texas . <p> Outfield - Right fielder Bell would have driven in more than 100 runs last season if he had n't missed the last month of the season with a torn thigh muscle . Speedy center fielder Hunter also was hampered by injuries , but he had an outstanding rookie season . <p> Left field is the only spot that is somewhat uncertain , but it 's likely manager Terry Collins will platoon Mouton and May to give the team a much-needed lefthanded hitter in the lineup against righthanded pitchers . <p> John Cangelosi , who hit .318 last year , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will take a hard look at young Venezuelan Bob Abreu , who likely will be a starter soon but may still be a year away . <p> Infield - The right side is as good as it gets with Biggio and Bagwell , and the left side should be improved with the addition of Berry . Miller will start at shortstop with Ricky Gutierrez as the backup . Mike Simms will back up Bagwell , and Spiers will fill in at second and third . <p> Catching - The Astros were pleased with what they saw from Wilkins last September when he returned from back surgery . He handles pitchers well and takes charge on the field . Eusebio proved he can be a quality big-league hitter who can drive in some runs . Since Eusebio hits righthanded and Wilkins left , the Astros believe they have a solid combination behind the plate . <p> Pat Borders , a late-season acquisition from Kansas City last year , was a free agent who signed with St. Louis . <p> That 's the team the Astros will try to win with in 1996 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With the Central Division champion Reds losing key players like Ron Gant and David Wells , Hunsicker thinks the race is up for grabs . <p> " " I think it is going to be wide-open , " he said . " " St. Louis clearly has moved up on paper ( with the addition of Gant , Andy Benes , Gary Gaetti , Royce Clayton and Borders ) , but it 's hard to say how it will affect the chemistry of your team when you make so many changes . " <p> For the most part , the Astros have elected to go with the team they had in 1995 , which they believe would have made the playoffs if not for injuries to Bagwell and Bell late in the season . <p> " " What we have to do is keep our key players healthy , " Hunsicker said . " " If we do , I think this team can win a division championship . "
