American Express never really wanted a 282-ft. yacht . Bankers Trust is n't sure what it will do with the Grand Hyatt in midtown Manhattan , especially in the middle of a recession , nor is Manufacturers Hanover exactly giddy about owning the Regency Hotel in Atlantic City . But then Citicorp is not exactly cut out to be a retailer or an airline operator , either . <P> Meet Donald Trump 's bankers . Like the characters in the fairy tale The Emperor 's New Clothes , a gaggle of major financial institutions has finally been forced to admit , after lending Trump billions of dollars , that there 's a lot less to the emperor  --  or at least his empire  --  than the banks had believed . Not quite nine months after bailing out Trump with a rescue package that gave him $65 million in new loans and eased credit terms on his bank debt , Trump 's bankers last week stopped the game . Already more than $3.8 billion in the hole and sliding perilously close to a mammoth personal bankruptcy , the brash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismantling of his vast holdings . Meeting round the clock at secret Manhattan locations , Trump 's lawyers and bankers by week 's end had begun to hammer out a complex series of agreements on the distribution of some of his assets . <P> While many of the details remain to be settled in coming weeks , the broad outlines are clear  --  and despite his desperate situation , Trump , who has always prided himself on his mastery of dealmaking , once again seems to have come up with a strong hand . Pooh-poohing any notion that he was cornered , Trump insisted last week that the talks were friendly . " I have a great relationship with the banks , " he said , adding airily , " The 1990s are a decade of deleveraging . I 'm doing it too . " <P> That 's one way of describing what has befallen him . While he will give up his beloved Trump Princess yacht , the Trump Shuttle , the Regency , his half- interest in the Hyatt and his 27% interest in the Alexander 's store chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the Plaza Hotel , Fifth Avenue 's Trump Tower and a valuable tract of undeveloped Hudson River waterfront . He 'll also keep his lavish Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach , Fla. , which features a 118-room mansion and a nine-hole golf course . <P> Most important , Trump has eluded the specter of personal bankruptcy by whittling his debt down to more manageable proportions . The amount of debt that Trump guaranteed personally  --  several hundred million dollars  --  is breathtaking even by the standards of the ' 80s . In negotiations so far , the banks have agreed to secure some of that debt with the Plaza and other assets . <P> Trump has bet his future most heavily on Atlantic City by holding on to his three casinos there : the billion-dollar Trump Taj Mahal , the Trump Castle and the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino . Considering his present straits , the move may make sense . After all , he still must come up with millions in annual interest payments . As he once said of the casino business , " Most of all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worst behind him , Trump will be forced to file for bankruptcy protection for the struggling Taj Mahal casino next month . Like a growing number of corporate debtors , though , Trump is not flying blind into bankruptcy court : he has already negotiated most of the terms of the Taj reorganization.
