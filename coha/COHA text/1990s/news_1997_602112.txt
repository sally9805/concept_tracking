<p> Every day , Jason Welensky connects to the Internet , convinced there 's a fortune to be made in cyberspace . <p> The software programmer calls up such sites as the Chicago Board Options Exchange ( cboe.com ) to get stock options prices . Or Investor Square ( investorsquare.com ) , to chart stock movements . Or Zacks Investment research ( zacks.com ) , for earnings information , commentaries and other data . When he feels the magic , when intuition stirs , he goes to a Web site run by E*Trade Securities , to place orders to buy and sell stocks and stock options . " I 'm new to investing , but I 'm up 20% this year , " says Welensky , 42 , who manages a $ 20,000 portfolio from his Simsbury , Conn. , home <p> No stockbroker . No financial adviser . Not even a phone call to a discount-brokerage firm . Investors like Welensky instead rely on personal computers , the trove of investing data available on line , rock-bottom trading fees  --  and guts . While many say they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investing is exploding . It now ranks as one of the Internet 's most surprising successes , a killer application that portends profound changes in the brokerage business . <p> The number of on-line brokerage accounts is expected to hit 14.4 million by the end of 2002 , vs. 2.96 million this year , Forrester Research predicts . By 2002 , one in five Internet households will be investing on line , it says . Datek Securities , one of the fastest-growing on-line brokerages , is opening 1,500 accounts a day . Retail revenue ( commissions ) from on-line trading is expected to more than double to $ 614 million this year , Piper Jaffray estimates . In the next four years , revenueis expected to surge 49.2% annually . <p> " This is the standout success of electronic commerce , " says Bill Barnham , stock analyst at Piper Jaffray . " A sea change in personal investing , " pronounces John Markese , president of the American Association of Individual Investors . Which explains why more than 40 companies now offer Internet-based securities trading , led by discount-brokerage giant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mutual fund companies are edging into the market . Even full-service brokerage companies  --  like Merrill Lynch and Dean Witter  --  are wading in , as customers demand Internet-based services . <p> The appeal <p> Perhaps the biggest lure of cyber-investing : rock-bottom commissions . If you place an order for 500 shares at $ 25 at a full-service brokerage , the fee can top $ 250 . If you place the order by calling a representative of Fidelity Investments or Charles Schwab , it costs about $ 118 . But if you trade via the Web , the commissions go down  --  a lot : to $ 29.95 and $ 28.95 respectively through Schwab 's or Fidelity 's Web sites . E*Trade charges less than $ 20 for most trades . Datek , of Iselin , N.J. , charges $ 9.99 . <p> Such low commissions let investors make profitable trades with just a few thousand dollars . " If you 're an active trader , you really ca n't invest any other way . The commissions will kill you , " says investor Scott Taylor of Bradenton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college student Elliott Bass of New York City says : " I was looking for the cheapest way to invest . " He chose Datek , and recently bought shares of six stocks , paying total commissions of just $ 59.70 . <p> On-line traders also rely on the Internet for information and research about various investments . Many sites  --  from Playboy to USA TODAY Online  --  let people plug in stock symbols and get prices , often delayed 20 minutes . Many services provide real-time quotes for a fee . Sites such as Zacks and Yahoo Finance offer a wealth of investor data . The American Association of Individual Investors ' Journal recently published a list of 254 personal investing sites . <p> Says Markese of the AAII : " You still wo n't have as much information as institutional investors , but the information gap is closing . " That has made cyber-investors bolder . " I feel I can do the same kind of financial analysis that a professional trader can , " says Derrick Mancini , a physicist in Argonne , Ill. , who trades an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power is all in your hands , " Bass says . " It makes investing a much more stimulating experience . " And there is nothing like making money . Taylor says he performs a " dance of joy " whenever a trade yields a profit . It often keeps people coming back to their PCs to make more trades . " But it 's not an obsession  - -  yet , " Welensky says . " I can still go out for an evening and not miss it . " But he admits to " some anxious moments " recently when he was on vacation in Florida and could n't log on . <p> For a different kind of angst , consider Michael Amland , a computer software specialist from Hampton Roads , Va . On Friday , May 9 , he logged onto the E*Trade Web site about 9:20 a.m. and placed an order , to be executed when the market opened , to buy $ 30,000 worth of call options on Intel stock ( a bet that the stock will rise ) . Ten minutes later , he changed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order went through , so he tried to access the E*Trade Web site to cancel the order . He could n't . <p> " The market was going nuts , " he says . So was he . He says he tried three different Internet service providers , which he subscribes to for work , and still could n't log on . " The pages would come up partially , and then stall , " he says . Finally , about 10:30 , he started receiving a string of confirmation orders that were confusing . The bottom line : He was credited with buying the options , and the cancel order never went through . The options expired , worthless , about a week later . <p> Amland blames E*Trade . E*Trade officials disagree and say they have encouraged Amland to seek arbitration . <p> Similar complaints are common among cyber-investors , and are often posted on Internet chat sites , where plaintiffs ' lawyers have left messages for prospective clients . Few on-line brokerages have been spared . <p> Kevin Kirkendall , a Cincinnati firefighter , says he lost about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ execute trades , so he often ended up selling at a lower price than he wanted . He started an " E*Trade sucks " thread on a Silicon Investor chat site . <p> Mike O'Neill , from Philadelphia , says he placed orders with Datek to sell 282 shares of Dow Chemical and Amoco , both trading in the mid-$ 90s . When he got his trade confirmation , his jaw fell . One stock was sold for $ 5 a share and the other for $ 26 a share . Datek voided the trades and put the stock back in his account . But by that time , the stocks were trading lower . O'Neill says he lost about $ 800 when he finally sold the stocks . " Generally , people have had good experiences , " says Datek 's senior manager , Alex Gore . <p> But the nightmare experiences , widely publicized on the Web , have not hurt business , companies say . E*Trade says it typically runs its Web server computers at only 25% of capacity , to be able to handle spikes of trading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of customers who open accounts . <p> Many investors see glitches as part of life . " You have to be able to live with that if you 're going to do this , " Mancini says . <p> The competition <p> With more people willing to live with the risks , competition for on-line investors is mounting . Everyone from dedicated Internet brokerages to banks , mutual fund companies and full-service brokerages are eyeing the market . Discount brokerages  --  which provide trading but no advice and research from a stock broker  --  have the most at stake . On-line trading accounted for 15.1% of the revenue in the discount brokerage market last year ( $ 1.8 billion ) , vs. 25% to 30% of revenue ( $ 2 billion market ) this year , Piper Jaffray says . <p> Not surprising , discount broker Charles Schwab has led the charge into on-line investing , accounting for about 35% of all on-line trades . Rival Fidelity Investments , which recently slashed fees to $ 28.95 a trade , and E*Trade tie for second with 13% each . <p> Full-service brokerages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Discover Brokerage Direct . Smith Barney and Merrill Lynch recently launched programs to let customers access account and other information on line . Merrill  --  the nation 's largest brokerage  --  also has said it will let clients trade on-line starting in early 1998 , though it will not offer discounted commissions . " We are doing this because clients have asked for it , for convenience , " says Randall Langdon of Merrill Lynch . <p> The future <p> Experts say there will always be people who want the kind of hand holding a stockbroker can offer : a lifetime financial plan , research from professional analysts and various credit and other financial services . " But as time goes on , the swing is toward on-line investing , " says Steven Wallace , CEO of Pacific Brokerage , a Los Angeles-based , on-line broker bought by Mellon Bank last month . <p> Wallace argues that once people get a taste of low-cost on-line trading , some wo n't turn back . " There will be mass defections of customers who will not need a salesman-broker anymore , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lifeblood . " <p> Consider medical student Jeffrey Stern of Chicago . He says he once had an account at Merrill Lynch . " But I was without question one of their small accounts . They never returned my calls , " he says . He now trades on-line with Waterhouse Securities . " I can now do my own trading and research . " <p> And even if people do n't fully defect from full-service firms , customers can always put fresh money into an on-line account . " We 're seeing that all the time , " Wallace says . The fight for the future might come down to who does a better job winning over the likes of programmer Welensky . " For me , the jury is still out on a full-service broker . I would like the research . They could probably get me better prices . And you have a human being you can talk to about strategy . But here 's the thing : There is no reason why I ca n't use the information from a brokerage firm and turn around and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them that I was doing that , but I would save on the commissions .
