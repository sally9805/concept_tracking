<p> I am the mother of Steven Evilsizer , who was shot and killed by police on Aug. 27 . The indescribable heartache of losing our son has prevented me from responding until now , but I feel I owe it to Steven , his wife , his grandparents and his extended family to comment on these articles that have caused so much pain for our family . The media have devoted considerable space to the negative side of our son and how he died . How much space will they allow for his positive side ? <p> Regarding the articles : <p> Immediately after this tragic event , members of the family were inundated with phone calls from the newspapers , radio stations , etc. - each one pressing us for our reaction to the shooting in an obvious attempt to get us to lash out verbally at the police for their actions . ( We even received calls and letters from lawyers offering their services for a lawsuit . ) In the midst of our emotional anguish , we were trying so very hard to refrain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the investigations were completed . The few comments we did make were taken out of context , and it seemed to us that we were made to sound like cold , uncaring parents - when in fact , the pain and agony of losing our son ( especially under such tragic circumstances ) interspersed with the inevitable question , What could we have done differently ? ? were so debilitating . <p> In one article , my husband was made to sound as though he would have recommended ' five shots ' ( when he was trying to make the point that he did not understand why so many shots had to be fired . ) At another point , it was stated that I did not condemn the police for their actions , then added almost glibly was my comment , ' The police had a job to do . ' Reporters and media callers admonished us for not being angry enough . ( If I were to direct my anger , it would be toward the dealers who reap huge profits from the lives they destroy with the drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation , Chuck Lepley of the district attorney 's office was very responsive and sensitive to our requests for information . We have now reviewed the investigative reports from the fire investigators and the DA 's office and watched the taped interviews of the policemen and the fire investigators involved . As devastating as it is , we can not deny the fact that Steven 's state of mind ( altered by the paranoia resulting from high drug/alcohol levels ) and his refusal to comply with the policemen 's repeated warnings and demands prompted their reactions . <p> Although we will never understand why the three policemen felt it necessary to fire a total of 23 shots to stop Steven , we are cognizant of the fact that our son 's actions placed himself and others in harm 's way . We realize he had to be stopped from injuring others with the knife he held in his hand . That 's what I meant when I said I understood that the police had a job to do . Did all three policemen overreact ? Many seem to think so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't there faced with making those split-second assessments and decisions . And , unlike in the movies , they do not attempt to shoot weapons out of the person 's hand or shoot an armed person in the leg , etc . <p> We thank God that our son 's actions did not result in death or injury to the policemen , the firefighters , or the occupants of the apartment building that night . <p> Additionally , we were horror-struck by two things : First , the horrible ' mug shot ' photograph that originally appeared on some TV stations and in the newspapers . Is it asking too much for the media to request a decent photograph from the family ? Young nieces and nephews were horrified by the photograph because they did n't recognize that person as their Uncle Steve . ( The Post and Channel 4 News later substituted another photograph when we pleaded with them to use one provided by the family . ) <p> Second , was it really necessary to include a diagram representing our son 's bullet-ridden body in the Oct. 4 article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> That depiction was not of a cardboard target for shooting practice - that was our son , for God 's sake ! ! Do you have any idea of the emotional impact that had on the family ? <p> I would like to tell you about the other side of our son . The Steven we knew and loved was sensitive and kind , was deeply touched by the music and lyrics of his favorite songs ( he recently expressed to an aunt how the words of the song , ' In the Arms of the Angels ' by Sarah McLachlan , spoke to him these days ) . He loved fly fishing , camping , the Colorado mountains , skiing , Eric Clapton songs , airplanes , air shows , cars , Trivial Pursuit , reading , cooking - and his family . <p> Steven was the first grandchild on both sides and was still called T-Bone , a childhood nickname , by his grandfather . <p> There was a certain sense of melancholy as he watched his younger brothers go off to college , but he was extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would call Steve during the good times and ask if he wanted to go flying with him ; and Brad ( a musician ) whose heart ached over the plight of his ' big brother ' and the call he feared he would receive someday . And did . <p> Steve 's culinary skills ( from years in the catering and banquet business ) made family holidays very special . He even catered his own wedding ! Grandparents , aunts/uncles and cousins knew they could count on Steve for always remembering family birthdays and anniversaries and sending meaningful cards and notes to mark the occasion . <p> Steve derived such joy in doing special things for his friends and family in an attempt make up for some of the anguish he knew he had caused them . He was especially eager to work alongside his dad on various projects . <p> Recently , while house/pet sitting for a close friend who was out of town , Steve replanted the newly planted tomato plants that had surrendered to a late frost . He cared . It was reported that Steve was recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was assistant director of outlets , had been named Manager of the Month last December , and had recently been promoted to executive steward due to his many achievements and awards at the Hyatt . <p> That error may seem trivial to you , but it 's important to us in that it says so much about Steve 's progress and achievements in overcoming his addiction . ( Additionally , while at the Denver Athletic Club , he had been named Employee of the Year . ) <p> Steven received tremendous support from the hotel staff during the periods when he appeared to be winning his battle over his alcoholism ; and he was so proud of his accomplishments at the hotel . His memorial service was attended by at least 50 employees from the Hyatt , many of whom came forward to express personal thoughts and recollections of Steve . There were those who knew firsthand of the battle Steve fought every day . <p> And truly it was a daily battle . He used to say , ' I fight it every single day . Some days I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what prompted the lack of self-esteem that led to his addiction ? As his parents , we ask ourselves that question every day ; I wish I had the answer . Why does a young boy with an extremely high IQ turn to drugs ? ( Steve attended Mission Viejo Elementary , Laredo Middle School , and Smoky Hill High School where he had been active in scouting , sports , etc . ) I do know that he still carried the scars caused by the seemingly harmless teasing and harassment by classmates in elementary and middle school ( when ' acceptance ' and ' belonging ' is everything ) . Even as a slender adult , he used to say that every time he looked in the mirror he saw that fat kid that the other kids made fun of . If only kids could realize that words even more than actions can cut such deep wounds - wounds that sometimes never heal . <p> Whatever the cause(s) , his addiction caused Steve to lose his feeling of self-worth , his job , his wife and ultimately his life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he relapsed in January ( for whatever reason ) and started the downward spiral from which he could not seem to recover . The cycle was always the same : relapse , followed by unbearable pain , guilt and depression ( not to mention the brushes with the law ) , soothed only by more alcohol or drugs . <p> The weariness from his insomnia was a constant . He struggled valiantly for a long time and sought help through an extensive drug/alcohol rehab program , AA , one-on-one counseling , etc . Steven knew he had a wife and family that loved and supported him , but even that was not enough . ( As parents , we are thankful that he had a loving wife who filled a void in his life no parent can ever fill ; but she could no longer endure the emotional and financial/legal consequences of his relapses and blackouts . ) He eventually caved in to the debilitating weariness that overcame him . He used to say , ' I 'm so tired of starting over . ' While his wife and family struggled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enabling , ' he set forth on a path of self-destruction . And our repeated attempts to intercede were in vain . He felt he had lost everything and had simply given up . <p> In my heart I feel that it was God who decided when Steve would leave this world , not the policemen that night . The man they shot was not the Steven we knew and loved ; but he took our Steven with him . <p> We had ' lost ' the son we knew before the first shot was ever fired . Perhaps God felt Steven had struggled long enough with the emotional roller coaster caused by the periods of positive recovery shattered by the recurrent relapses . <p> Now there will only be one set of footprints in the sand . We take comfort in knowing that he is finally at peace - a peace that seems to have eluded him in this life . No more pain , no more struggle . <p> Our lives have been forever changed ; there will always be that void . Neither tears nor unwarranted lawsuits will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closure and to go on with our lives one day at a time , we are haunted by the events of Aug. 27 ; but we will not allow them to overshadow the good memories of a beloved son . In our hearts , he will live forever ! @p#
